<p><hi rend="small-caps">i</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Carlyle as Editor and Critic of Literary Letters</hi></p>
<p>The first editor of the Carlyle letters was Carlyle himself, but the letters which he edited were his wife&#x2019;s, not his own. A little over two months after her death on <date when="1866-04-21">21 April 1866</date>, he put aside for some days the work which he was doing on a memoir of her, later published in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, in order to engage in &#x201C;a strenuous search for, and collection of all her letters now discoverable.&#x201D; His wife&#x2019;s cousin, Maggie Welsh of Liverpool, who was keeping house for him at the time, and later his niece, Mary Aitken, helped him with this work. The letters written before <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>, many of which he found later, eluded him for the moment. Those which he found and put in order presented him with some very formidable editorial problems, as they have later editors. But he realized clearly how invaluable his knowledge was in annotating these letters, and during the next few years he edited thoroughly and well all of Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s letters that he could get his hands on. The work was a labor of love to him. Yet it was much more than a sentimental gesture. He knew that these letters had very high value as literature and that he owed something to posterity as well as to her memory in the custody which he held over them. On <date when="1866-07-08">8 July 1866</date> he wrote of them:</p>
<q>They are exceedingly difficult to arrange; not having in general any <hi rend="italic">date</hi>; so that place often enough, and day and even year throughout, are mainly to be got by the <hi rend="italic">Post OfficeStamp</hi>, supported by inference and inquiry such as is still possible, at least to me.</q>
<q>The whole of yesterday I spent in reading and arranging the <hi rend="italic">letters</hi> of <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>; such a day&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> as I perhaps never had inmy life before. What a piercing radiancy of meaning to me in those dear records, hastily thrown off, full of misery, yet of bright eternal love; all as if on wings of lightning, tingling through one&#x2019;s very heart of hearts! &#x2026; Constantly there is such an electric shower of all-illuminating brilliancy,penetration, recognition, wise discernment, just enthusiasm, humour, grace, patience, courage, love,&#x2014;and in fine of spontaneous nobleness of mind and intellect,&#x2014;as I know not where to parallel! I <pb id="pg-01-x" n="01:x"/>have asked myself, Ought all this to be lost, or kept for myself, and the brief time that now belongs to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>? Can <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> of it be saved, then, for the worthy that still remain among these roaring myriads of profound unworthy? I really must consider it further &#x2026; . As to &#x201C;talent,&#x201D; epistolary and other, these <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, I perceive, for &#x201C;talent,&#x201D; &#x201C;genius,&#x201D; or whatever we may call it, what an evidence, if my little woman needed that to me! Not all the <hi rend="italic">Sands</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Eliots</hi> and babbling <hi rend="italic">cohue</hi> of &#x201C;celebrated scribbling women&#x201D; that have strutted over the world, in my time, could, it seems to me, if all boiled down and distilled to essence, make one such woman. But it is difficult to make these letters fairly legible; except myself there is nobody at all that can completely <hi rend="italic">read</hi> them, as they now are. They abound in allusions, very full of meaning in this circle, but perfectly dark and void in all others: &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Coteriesprache</hi></foreign>,&#x201D; as the Germans call it, &#x201C;family-circle dialect,&#x201D; occurs every line or two; nobody ever so <hi rend="italic">rich</hi> in that kind as she; ready to pick up every diamond-spark, out of the common floor-dust, and keep it brightly available; so that hardly, I think in any house, was there <hi rend="italic">more</hi> of &#x201C;Coterie-speech,&#x201D; shining innocently, with a perpetual expressiveness and twinkle generally of quiz and real humour about it, than in ours. She mainly was the creatress of all this; unmatchable for quickness (and trueness) in regard to it;&#x2014;and in her letters it is continually recurring; shedding such a lambency of &#x201C;own fireside&#x201D; over everything, if you are in the secret.</q> 
<p>Usually, before annotating the letters, Carlyle had them copied, many of them by Maggie Welsh and others by his niece Mary Aitken, who married Alexander Carlyle, Carlyle&#x2019;s nephew and editor of many of the letters. Today most of the original letters are in the National Library of Scotland, but the copies with Carlyle&#x2019;s annotations on them are in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library. Carlyle himself did not publish the letters, but Froude and Alexander Carlyle used most of his annotations in their editions of Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s letters.</p>
<p>Carlyle&#x2019;s tact in collecting the letters and conscientiousness in editing them are illustrated by the methods through which he got and dealt with those to Mrs. Betty Braid, maid in the Welsh household at Haddington when Jane was a girl, and to Mrs. James H. Stirling, born Susan Hunter, who had been an intimate friend of Mrs. Carlyle. To Betty Braid he wrote on Jane&#x2019;s birthday, <date when="1869-07-14">14 July 1869</date>:</p>
<q>This is a day sad and sacred to both of us; and except myself I know that there is none more lovingly mindful of Her who is gone from us than you always are. &#x2026;</q>
<q>For this long while past I am busy collecting all her letters, getting them copied, dated, made legible to friends that may survive me. <pb id="pg-01-xi" n="01:xi"/>There is often mention of you, you may guess how kindly;&#x2014;if you have any of hers to you, as I think is likely, it would be a great favour to send them or such of them as you think the best.</q> 
<p>Mrs. Braid sent the letters promptly, and Carlyle thanked her in a letter of <date when="1869-07-22">22 July</date>. Carlyle got the letters from Mrs. Stirling through his brother Dr. John Aitken Carlyle. After they had come, Carlyle wrote to his brother, <date when="1873-01-14">14 January 1873</date>:</p>
<q>Your strong <hi rend="italic">pouch</hi> of an envelope brought us the precious letters quite safe; Maggie is busy copying them. They are naturally of the tenderest interest to me; very beautiful, very mournful, and bring back into clearness of an almost preternatural sort the days that are for ever gone. Most of the letters are undated, indeed all of them, except some of those that have covers: but I can recollect nearly every event they touch upon, &#x26; by dint of strict search among the documents here, Maggie &#x26; I ought to get an accurate or approximate date for almost all of them.</q>
<q>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Stirling shall soon have the letters back; in the meanwhile if she could recollect for us the dates of her several visits to London, of her first acquaintance with us (at Edinburgh in <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>?); at any rate, of her own marriage and removal from Dundee to Edinburgh,&#x2014;all this or any part of it will be an essential help in the process. Thank her very much for her kindness to me, now &#x26; always; assure her of my affectionate wishes, &#x26; best regards so long as I live.</q> 
<p>Some of Carlyle&#x2019;s own letters came back to him with Jane&#x2019;s letters from time to time, so that when he died in <date when="1881-00-00">1881</date> he left at Froude&#x2019;s disposal a much larger collection of letters than most literary men are able to leave. Most of these are in the National Library of Scotland today. Although Carlyle rarely annotated his own letters, he delighted in autobiographical as well as biographical writing and clearly wished the letters preserved as a record of his life that would be as full as possible. There can be no doubt, moreover, that he realized their intrinsic value as literary letters.</p>
<p>Before working with his wife&#x2019;s letters, Carlyle had collected and edited those of Oliver Cromwell, and he had demonstrated the value of letters in biographical writing in his <hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi>. In his <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> (<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>) he writes eloquently concerning the value of letters, the careful preservation of them, the authentic presentation of them, and the adequate elucidation of them:</p>
<q>Letters and authentic Utterances of Oliver lie scattered, in print and manuscript, in a hundred repositories, in all varieties of condition and environment. Most of them, all the important of them, have already long since been printed and again printed; but we cannot in <pb id="pg-01-xii" n="01:xii"/>general say, ever read: too often it is apparent that the very editor of these poor utterances had, if reading mean understanding, never <hi rend="italic">read</hi> them. They stand in their old spelling; mispunctuated, misprinted, unelucidated, unintelligible,&#x2014;defaced with dark incrustations too well known to students of that Period. &#x2026;</q>
<q>Nevertheless these Documents do exist, authentic though defaced; and invite everyone who would know that Period, to study them till they become intelligible again. The words of Oliver Cromwell,&#x2014;the meaning <hi rend="italic">they</hi> had, must be worth recovering, in that point of view. To collect these Letters and authentic Utterances, as one&#x2019;s reading yielded them, was a comparatively grateful labour; to correct them, elucidate and make them legible again, was a good historical study. &#x2026; Enough is already lost and destroyed; we need not, in this particular case, omit farther. &#x2026;</q>
<q>For the rest, if each Letter look dim, and have little light, after all study;&#x2014;yet let the Historical reader reflect, such light as it has cannot be disputed at all. These words, expository of that day and hour, Oliver Cromwell did see fittest to be written down. The Letter hangs there in the dark abysses of the Past: if like a star almost extinct, yet like a real star; fixed; about which there is no cavilling possible. That autograph Letter, it was once all luminous as a burning beacon, every word of it a live coal, in its time; it was once a piece of the general fire and light of Human Life, that Letter! Neither is it yet entirely extinct: well read, there is still in it light enough to exhibit its own <hi rend="italic">self</hi>; nay to diffuse a faint authentic twilight some distance around it. Heaped embers which in the daylight looked black, may still look <hi rend="italic">red</hi> in the utter darkness. These Letters of Oliver will convince any man that the Past did exist! By degrees the combined small twilights may produce a kind of general feeble twilight, rendering the Past credible, the Ghosts of the Past in some glimpses of them visible! Such is the effect of contemporary letters always; and I can very confidently recommend Oliver&#x2019;s as good of their kind. A man intent to force for himself some path through that gloomy chaos called History of the Seventeenth Century, and to look face to face upon the same, may perhaps try it by this method as hopefully as by another. Here is an irregular row of beacon-fires, once all luminous as suns; and with a certain inextinguishable erubescence still, in the abysses of the dead deep Night. Let us look here. In shadowy outlines, in dimmer and dimmer crowding forms, the very figure of the old dead Time itself may perhaps be faintly discernible here! &#x2026;</q>
<q>I have corrected the spelling of these Letters; I have punctuated, and divided them into paragraphs, in the modern manner. &#x2026; Here and there, to bring out the struggling sense, I have added or rectified a word,&#x2014;but taken care to point out the same; what words in the Text of the Letters are mine, the reader will find marked off by double commas: it was of course my supreme duty to avoid altering, in any respect, not only the sense, but the smallest feature in the physiognomy, of the Original.</q> 
<p><pb id="pg-01-xiii" n="01:xiii"/>Carlyle did not insist that Cromwell&#x2019;s letters had any considerable merit as literature. Containing the authentic words of a great though somewhat enigmatic and not altogether articulate man, they were valuable chiefly in that they enabled the reader to understand the history of Cromwell&#x2019;s time and as so many dim points of light showed the &#x201C;Past&#x201D; in true outline. Biography was always to Carlyle one of the highest forms of literature, and he did not think of his Cromwell as true biography but entitled it, choosing his words carefully, <hi rend="italic">The Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell</hi>. He thought of his task here as essentially an editorial one, just as he had pretended to be performing such a task in dealing with Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh&#x2019;s imaginary manuscripts in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>. He liked editing, both the textual problems and the elucidation. <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), written rapidly while <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> was also under way, likewise deals editorially in the broad sense with text and ideas drawn from Jocelin de Brakelond&#x2019;s twelfth-century chronicle through selection, quotation, and comment. Carlyle may owe something to Coleridge here, who wrote his <hi rend="italic">Aids to Reflection</hi> by quoting passages from Archbishop Leighton and other seventeenth-century divines and then commenting on them.</p>
<p>But another major influence on Carlyle was Boswell, and Boswell valued letters in an age of great letter writers both as art in themselves and as material for great biographical art. When Carlyle turned to the writing of <hi rend="italic">The Life of John Sterling</hi> (<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), he realized that he not only had a subject excellent for biography but also letters by Sterling, many of which had been written to himself, that were excellent as autobiography and therefore valuable material for biography. Though they could not represent fully the glow of life characterizing Sterling&#x2019;s speech, much of Sterling was in them, and they were reasonably good as literary letters. Carlyle sums up his comments on them and appraises them in the following passage:</p>
<q>In all Sterling&#x2019;s Letters to myself and others, a large collection of which now lies before me, duly copied and indexed, there is, to one that knew his speech as well, a perhaps unusual likeness between the speech and the Letters; and yet, for most part, with a great inferiority on the part of these. These, thrown off, one and all of them, without premeditation, and with most rapid-flowing pen, are naturally as like his speech as writing can well be; this is their grand merit to us: but on the other hand, the want of the living tones, swift looks and motions, and manifold dramatic accompaniments, tells heavily, more heavily than common. &#x2026;</q>
<q>Meanwhile these Letters do excel in honesty, in candour and transparency; <pb id="pg-01-xiv" n="01:xiv"/>their very carelessness secures their excellence in this respect. And in another much deeper and more essential respect I must likewise call them excellent,&#x2014;in their childlike goodness, in the purity of heart, the noble affection and fidelity they everywhere manifest in the writer. This often touchingly strikes a familiar friend in reading them; and will awaken reminiscences (when you have the commentary in your own memory) which are sad and beautiful, and not without reproach to you on occasion. To all friends, and all good causes, this man is true; behind their back as before their face, the same man!&#x2014; Such traits of the autobiographic sort, from these Letters, as can serve to paint him or his life, and promise not to weary the reader, I must endeavour to select, in the sequel.</q> 
<p>The praise which Carlyle bestowed upon Sterling&#x2019;s letters was the same in kind, though not as high, as that bestowed by Sterling on Carlyle&#x2019;s when he began one of his letters as follows: &#x201C;My dear Carlyle,&#x2014;I have to thank you for two Letters, which, unlike other people&#x2019;s have the writer&#x2019;s signature in every word as well as at the end.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Carlyle did not work in ignorance of the great tradition of letter writers, English and French. In the early <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2019;s he contributed an article on Lady Mary Wortley Montagu to Dr. David Brewster&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopædia</hi> in the final paragraph of which he said:</p>
<q>But Lady Mary&#x2019;s principal merit is to be sought for in her letters. &#x2026; She seems to have been contented with herself, and therefore willing to be pleased with others; and her cheerful sprightly imagination, the elegance, the ease, and airiness of her style, are deservedly admired. Succeeding and more minute observers have confirmed the accuracy of her graphic descriptions. &#x2026; The continual gaiety, the pungent wit, with which she details the passing follies of a court, but too successfully imitating that of Louis XV., render her letters extremely amusing. In those written from her retirement at Lovere, we discern the same shrewdness of observation, with a little more carelessness of expression. The pensive, calm regret, which they breathe, and, above all, the tender affection for her daughter, the Countess of Bute, to whom they are generally addressed, perhaps more than compensate for the absence of that flow of spirits and exuberance of incident, which distinguished the correspondence of her youth.</q> 
<p>A great admirer of Boswell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi>, cognizant of the high merit of many of the letters quoted in it, he knew further how effectively Moore had used Byron&#x2019;s letters in his life of the poet and how skilfully Lockhart had used Sir Walter Scott&#x2019;s letters to show the reader the true quality of the man. To Carlyle, however, Scott&#x2019;s letters were not among the best. His discriminating comment on them reflects the keen interest which he took in letters as such and <pb id="pg-01-xv" n="01:xv"/>the thought which he gave to the problem of determining the qualities which go to make up a really good letter.</p>
<q>His letters &#x2026; are never without interest, yet also seldom or never very interesting. They are full of cheerfulness, of wit and ingenuity; but they do not treat of aught intimate; without impeaching their sincerity, what is called sincerity, one may say they do not, in any case whatever, proceed from the innermost parts of the mind. Conventional forms, due consideration of your own and your correspondent&#x2019;s pretensions and vanities, are at no moment left out of view. The epistolary stream runs on, lucid, free, gladflowing; but always, as it were, <hi rend="italic">parallel</hi> to the real substance of the matter, never coincident with it. One feels it hollowish under foot. Letters they are of a most humane man of the world, even exemplary in that kind; but with the man of the world always visible in them;&#x2014;as indeed it was little in Scott&#x2019;s way to speak, perhaps even with himself, in any other fashion.</q> 
<p>Carlyle knew Horace Walpole&#x2019;s letters, too, so far as they were available to him. In a letter to Lady Ashburton of <date when="1844-10-26">26 October 1844</date>, after speaking somewhat critically of Emerson&#x2019;s essays, soon forthcoming in England, he added: &#x201C;A much better Book for you, if you have it not already, will be Walpole&#x2019;s last series of <hi rend="italic">Letters to Horace Mann</hi>. They are full of English news, written during and after the American War. Harsh, bitter, withered, so far as I have looked; but full of vivacity, pictorial distinctness, and very amusing to read.&#x201D; Voltaire looms large in Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> (<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>), and Carlyle was well aware of his versatility and brilliance as a letter writer. The letters of Dickens, too, as quoted by John Forster in his biography of the novelist (<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>) delighted him, and in a letter of <date when="1874-02-16">16 February 1874</date> he commended Forster for the effective way in which he had used them:</p>
<q>By &#x2026; those sparkling, clear and sunny utterances of Dickens&#x2019;s own (bits of <hi rend="italic">auto</hi>-biography unrivalled in clearness and credibility) which were at your disposal, and have been intercalated every now and then, you have given to every intelligent eye the power of looking down to the very bottom of Dickens&#x2019;s mode of existing in this world; and I say have performed a feat which, except in Boswell, the unique, I know not where to parallel. So long as Dickens is interesting to his fellow-men, here will be seen, face to face, what Dickens&#x2019;s manner of existing was. This bright and joyful sympathy with everything around him; his steady practicality, withal; the singularly solid business talent he continually had; and, deeper than all, if one has the eye to see deep enough, dark, fateful silent elements, tragical to look upon, and hiding amid dazzling radiances as of the sun, the elements of death itself. <pb id="pg-01-xvi" n="01:xvi"/>Those two American Journies especially transcend in tragic interest to a thinking reader most things one has seen in writing!</q> 
<p>The qualities which Carlyle considered most desirable in letters, however, are most clearly indicated in the letters which he wrote to members of his family and to Jane Baillie Welsh, before his marriage in <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>. In the early years he did not hesitate to scold his brothers and sisters if their letters proved disappointing to him in any way. More than once he rebuked his brother John for writing him what he called a &#x201C;dud.&#x201D; On another occasion he would commend him: &#x201C;I thank you very kindly for your letter. It is of the right open-hearted kind, written without reserve from the fulness of your thoughts; and that is just the thing I want.&#x201D; To another brother he wrote: &#x201C;When you write, &#x2026; be not too careful of what you shall say, but especially in letters put down the thoughts warm and vivid as they present themselves before your fancy. They often gain in vigour what they want in elegance.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is well known that Carlyle in the years from <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date> to <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date> conducted his courtship of Jane Welsh in considerable part by playing the role of literary mentor to her. Her talent for writing letters was distinctly different from his. Furthermore, we can never know to what extent a good writer can be <hi rend="italic">taught</hi>, or what the exact nature of the teaching is. But we may safely assume that he was a reasonably effective teacher as well as a successful suitor. Like all other good teachers, he got results by bestowing upon his student a judicious mixture of criticism, praise, and constructive advice. He was teaching the most apt student of the art of writing letters produced by the nineteenth century, and he very early discovered the fact. His own best letters would be very different from hers, but he soon became aware of where her highest talents lay, and he skilfully drew them out in all their brightness. On <date when="1822-02-26">26 February 1822</date> he wrote to her: &#x201C;It seems to me that the chief end of letters is to exhibit to each a picture of the others soul&#x2014;of all the hopes and fears that agitate us, the joys and sorrows and varied anxieties in which a heart&#x2019;s friend may be expected to sympathize.&#x201D; In <date when="1822-06-00">June</date> of the same year he commended her for the carefree, happy spirit of her last letter: &#x201C;It is when letters are thrown off in that gay cheerful social way, that one has some pleasure in them.&#x201D; On <date when="1823-01-03">3 January 1823</date> he wrote: &#x201C;Let <supplied>[your letters be]</supplied> as long and careless as you possibly can.&#x201D; With perfect consistency he wrote on <date when="1823-01-20">20 January</date>: &#x201C;Throw by your books and papers, and be again a lively thoughtless racketting girl as you were before. <pb id="pg-01-xvii" n="01:xvii"/>There is much improvement to be got in such things; they give an exercise to the mind as difficult and valuable as any literary study can.&#x201D; And on <date when="1823-02-18">18 February</date> he repeated: &#x201C;Write to <supplied>[me as]</supplied> soon as possible: let the letter be as long and careless and garrulous and true-hearted as it can be made.&#x201D; When for the moment she became discouraged in the midst of her other literary efforts, he burst forth in loud praise of her work, her letters in particular, in a letter of <date when="1823-04-06">6 April</date>: &#x201C;I shall yet &#x2018;stand a-tiptoe&#x2019; at your name. Not write! I declare if I had known nothing of you but your letters, I should have pronounced you to be already an excellent writer.&#x201D; Further encouragement, with repetition of basic principles, followed in Carlyle&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1823-08-10">10 August</date>. And the tutor-lover became self-conscious, as he did on some other occasions, about the role that he was playing:</p>
<q>Write to me as nearly once a-day as your more important duties will possibly allow. Never dream that you have nothing to say: I like you best of all when you begin writing without a word to say; I am sure of a thousand delightful things when you abandon your soul to me without reserve, and send me all your &#x201C;diabolical&#x201D; thoughts and feelings just as they arise.&#x2014;Now is it not strange that I am ever wasting paper on this subject, long ago fixed as the law of the Medes and Persians which altereth not; ever corresponding by talking about correspondence?</q> 
<p>On <date when="1823-10-12">12 October</date> he resorted to argument from personal need but kept his tone light by asking for nonsense in her letters: &#x201C;I cannot exist without your letters&#x2014;at least I do not think I can. Write also without the smallest care; nonsense from <hi rend="italic">you</hi> is the best of all. Do I not set you an example?&#x201D; Almost a year later his advice and his praise were given in the same vein: &#x201C;Tell me every thing, in your dear <hi rend="italic">chatting</hi> style. There is nothing in life like one of your right letters.&#x201D; And on <date when="1824-09-02">2 September 1824</date>, several weeks later, he wrote: &#x201C;What skills it how <hi rend="italic">we</hi> write to one another, so we write enough, and with sufficient want of care!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The mixture of suitor&#x2019;s motive with literary principles in these passages need not blind us to the validity of the principles themselves. Good letters, Carlyle suggested to his brothers and insisted in his advice to Jane Welsh, must be spontaneous and conversational in tone; open, free, and full in conveying thought and feeling; never niggardly, never empty (though they need not convey <hi rend="italic">facts</hi>), and never contrived or calculating; always intensely personal, self-revealing, and intimate; and always sincere, not the least so when revelling in nonsense and playfulness. The movements of a good letter, like those of a <pb id="pg-01-xviii" n="01:xviii"/>minuet, must be quick and light. Carlyle may be heavy-handed at times in his books and at times even in his letters, but he sensed and fully appreciated the qualities in Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x2019;s letters which were not only most compatible with her own unique genius but which indicate that she had much in common with the other great letter writers of literature. And Carlyle&#x2019;s own letters and books are to be fully understood only when we remember how fully, freely, and often the spirit of fancy and playfulness enters into them.</p>
<p>About twice as many of his letters have survived as those of Mrs. Carlyle, roughly six thousand against more than three thousand. The explanation lies only in part in the fact that he lived about twenty years longer than she did. Actually, throughout her life she suffered much more than he did from bad health and morbid moods. Remembering and adhering consistently to the principle which Carlyle had laid down that a letter should reveal oneself without restraint, she did not like to write letters when in low spirits. In a letter to John Sterling of <date when="1837-02-01">1 February 1837</date>, she made a very succinct statement of the matter:</p>
<q>The fact is since I became so sick and dispirited, I have contracted a horror of letter-writing almost equal to the hydrophobea horror for cold water. I would write anything under Heaven fairy tales, or advertisements for Warren&#x2019;s blacking even rather than a letter! A letter behoves to tell about oneself, and when oneself is disagreeable to oneself, one would rather tell about anything else; for alas! one does not find the same gratification in dwelling upon one&#x2019;s own sin and misery as in showing up the sin and misery of one&#x2019;s neighbour.</q> 
<p>More humorously, excusing herself for not writing more often in a letter to her Liverpool cousin, Helen Welsh, she wrote in a letter of early <date when="1843-12-00">December 1843</date>:</p>
<q>I say to myself with the mild injured self-dignity of a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pecksniff</hi></foreign>, &#x201C;when <hi rend="italic">I</hi> fail in writing it is because I am sick, or because I am overworked or because (as Edward Irving once wrote to me) &#x2018;the Lord has other views with his servant, than that he should write so many letters of human love as in the bygone time!&#x2019;<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> it is never because I am amusing myself!&#x2014;the fact being that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> never amuse myself by any chance!&#x2014;<foreign>moi</foreign></q> 
<p>She was quite conscious, furthermore, of the faults as well as the merits of her husband and old teacher as a writer of both books and letters. Although she tried to avoid the subject of her bad health and gloomy state of mind in her letters, she could understand and forgive him for sometimes dwelling on these things at undue length. She could <pb id="pg-01-xix" n="01:xix"/>also forgive and even justify the labored, heavy, extremely emphatic manner in which he sometimes wrote. Regenerating, unconventional truths such as his must, she once told her husband, be shot from the mouth of a cannon if they are to take effect. Yet there was fully as much truth in what she said when she told her Chelsea neighbor, Mrs. Alexander Gilchrist: &#x201C;Carlyle always writes well when he writes fast.&#x201D; And she never forgot or abandoned the primary lesson Carlyle had taught her about the nature of good letters when he had said that they must be intimate and self-revealing. Queen Victoria complained that Gladstone addressed her as if she were a public meeting. After her husband had become a celebrity and a public figure, Jane Carlyle complained with considerably more feeling when on rare occasions he forgot his own basic principle in letter writing, particularly important in a letter to his wife. When Carlyle was touring Ireland in <date when="1849-07-00">July 1849</date>, Jane sent a letter which she had just received from him on to Scotland to his brother John to be read by him and the rest of the family there. It was a full letter, but she did not like it, and her comment to John gives the reason why: &#x201C;Here is a letter from him&#x2014;which I wish you all much good of. That sort of letter all about everything and for the public good is nothing to me.&#x201D; The only moral that can be drawn from this seems to be that teachers, even if geniuses, who are not going to follow their own precepts with perfect consistency should beware of marrying their best students.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">ii</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Other Collectors and Editors</hi></p>
<p>Other editors of the letters have been numerous and of many varying degrees of competence. Edwin
P. Hood in his <hi rend="italic">Thomas Carlyle</hi> (<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>) printed letters and excerpts from letters. In the year of Carlyle&#x2019;s death, <date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>, two biographies of him, one by Richard Herne Shepherd and the other by Moncure D. Conway, contained a considerable number of letters. Froude&#x2019;s four-volume biography of Carlyle (<date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>) draws extensively on the correspondence of both Carlyles; and his <hi rend="italic">Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi> in three volumes, enriched by Carlyle&#x2019;s annotations, came out in <date when="1883-00-00">1883</date>. Froude was one of the most intelligent of all the editors, but his handling of texts was inexcusably careless and even irresponsible. Charles Eliot Norton was a fairly good editor. His <hi rend="italic">Correspondence of Thomas Carlyle and Ralph Waldo Emerson</hi> (<date when="1883-00-00">1883</date>), <hi rend="italic">Early Letters of Thomas Carlyle, <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date></hi> (<date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>), <hi rend="italic">Correspondence between Goethe and Carlyle</hi> (<date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>), and <hi rend="italic">Letters of Thomas Carlyle, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date></hi> (<date when="1889-00-00">1889</date>) are usually <pb id="pg-01-xx" n="01:xx"/>though not always trustworthy as to text; they also have helpful notes, but the notes are not always full enough, and there are regrettable though perhaps justifiable omissions (always indicated) in the letters. Norton&#x2019;s own collected letters (<date when="1913-00-00">1913</date>) contain his letters to Carlyle and two letters from him. His &#x201C;Recollections of Carlyle,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">New Princeton Review</hi>, II (<date when="1886-07-00">July 1886</date>), 1&#x2013;19, is well worth reading.</p>
<p>Probably the most able editor of the letters so far has been Alexander Carlyle, son of Carlyle&#x2019;s brother Alexander and husband of his first cousin Mary Aitken, Carlyle&#x2019;s niece and amanuensis. Educated in literary studies in Canada, Alexander Carlyle came into possession of the large collection of letters and manuscripts which Carlyle in his will had placed at the disposal of Froude, with further instructions that Froude was to give them to Mary when he was through with them. From this large collection of letters and still others which he found, Alexander Carlyle selected the letters which he published in a considerable number of books and articles. Except for his tiresome habit of sniping at Froude, whose faults soon become well known and may thereafter be taken for granted, his editing deserves considerable praise. He knew literature and its disciplines; he made a lifetime study of Carlyle&#x2019;s life and writings; he was familiar with the family history and knew all the ramifications of the family relationships; he knew the Scottish background and the fine points concerning the Scottish language; and he had an abundance of materials to work with. There are many omissions in the letters which he published; but these are almost always indicated, and the omissions were in the main judicious in his day. He published the following collections of letters: <hi rend="italic">New Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi>, two volumes (<date when="1903-00-00">1903</date>); <hi rend="italic">New Letters of Thomas Carlyle</hi>, two volumes (<date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>); <hi rend="italic">The Love Letters of Thomas Carlyle and Jane Welsh</hi>, two volumes (<date when="1909-00-00">1909</date>); &#x201C;Eight New Love Letters of Jane Welsh,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Nineteenth Century and After</hi>, LXXV (<date when="1914-01-00">January 1914</date>), 86&#x2013;113; &#x201C;More New Letters of Jane Welsh Carlyle,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Nineteenth Century and After</hi>, LXXVI (<date when="1914-00-00">1914</date>), 317&#x2013;49; &#x201C;Correspondence between Carlyle and Browning,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine</hi>, N.S., XXXVIII (<date when="1915-05-00">May 1915</date>), 642&#x2013;69; &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle and Thomas Spedding,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine</hi>, N.S., L (<date when="1921-05-00">May</date>&#x2013;<date when="1921-06-00">June 1921</date>), 513&#x2013;37, 742&#x2013;68; <hi rend="italic">Letters of Thomas Carlyle to John Stuart Mill, John Sterling, and Robert Browning</hi> (<date when="1923-00-00">1923</date>).</p>
<p>Many other editors and writers of biographies, of pamphlets, and of articles for newspapers and magazines have been attracted to the Carlyle letters like bees to the honeycomb.

<p>A new era in Carlyle studies began in <date when="1928-00-00">1928</date> when Miss Margaret Carlyle Aitken presented 700 autograph letters of her uncle, Thomas Carlyle, to the National Library of Scotland. This gift was followed by large donations of letters and manuscripts by her cousin, Alexander Carlyle, from <date when="1929-00-00">1929</date> until his death in <date when="1931-00-00">1931</date>. Many important accessions have been made by this library since then, and it now has more than eighty-four bound volumes of Carlyle letters. They are in the main made up of the great mass of material that Carlyle himself collected and left to Froude in his will, with stipulation that they were to be <pb id="pg-01-xxiv" n="01:xxiv"/>given to Mary, Carlyle&#x2019;s niece and Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s wife, when Froude was through with them. About <date when="1934-00-00">1934</date>, also, Carlyle scholars were further encouraged by the appearance of copious excerpts from the 282 letters that the Carlyles wrote to the Ashburtons, an indication that these extremely important and interesting letters might later be made available for complete publication. Through the kindness of the present owner, the Marquess of Northampton, they will all be published complete in this edition.</p>
<p>The present project to find, edit, and publish all letters by Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle was begun in <date when="1952-00-00">1952</date>. To date, about 9,500 letters have been found. Of these about 4,500 have not been published, 3,700 by Thomas and 800 by Jane. Many of the published letters are incomplete, some of them mere quotations or excerpts.</p>
<p>More than half of the letters, 4,780, are in the National Library of Scotland in the great collection begun by Carlyle himself, which contains many accessions added since Carlyle&#x2019;s death. Roughly 3,400 of these are by Thomas, and 1,380 by Jane. The National Library of Scotland also contains some hundreds of letters written to the Carlyles. The other letters by the Carlyles are to be found in various libraries and private collections all over the world, as the following table listing the largest holdings indicates.</p>

<p>Many other letters to the Carlyles are in libraries widely scattered throughout the world. In the period from <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date> through <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> out of a total of 1,150 letters found, only 153, or 14 per cent, have been found in printed form only, leaving 86 per cent for which the text is based on facsimiles of the original letters. This ratio improves with the later letters, for which at least 90 per cent of the manuscripts have been found.</p>
<p>The largest number of letters written to one correspondent is 1,050, the letters to Dr. John A. Carlyle, of which 1,009 were written by Thomas. The next largest number of letters received by one correspondent is the 949 which Thomas wrote to Jane. Others who received fifty or more letters from the Carlyles are Mrs. Margaret A. Carlyle (Carlyle&#x2019;s mother), Jean Carlyle Aitken (his sister), Joseph Neuberg, John Forster, Alexander Carlyle (Carlyle&#x2019;s brother), Emerson, John Stuart Mill, Lady Harriet Baring (later Lady Ashburton), Richard Monckton Milnes, Henry Larkin, and John Sterling.</p>
<p>The letters found indicate that the Carlyles were much more prolific in writing letters during some years than in others. During the last five years of his life Carlyle wrote an average of only seventeen letters a year. On the other hand, from <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> through <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date> his yearly average was 169 letters. Jane appears to have written very few letters before she began to live in London in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>. During the first eight years of her married life, from <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date> to <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, when she lived at Comely Bank, Edinburgh, and Craigenputtoch, our figures based on the letters found indicate that she averaged writing only nine letters a year. Certainly she must have written many more in this period, some <pb id="pg-01-xxvi" n="01:xxvi"/>of them now lost, others perhaps destroyed. The undoubtedly numerous letters by both Carlyles to Jeffrey and the Bullers have not been found. Dickens, we know, destroyed most of his letters from the Carlyles. Most of the letters from the Carlyles to Edward Irving have been lost. Jane&#x2019;s best years were those which were also Carlyle&#x2019;s, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>, when her yearly average was 116. In the last six years of her life, despite much illness and suffering, she managed to write sixty-two letters a year, a really heroic achievement.</p>
<lb/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">iv</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Questions, Problems, Difficulties, Editorial Policies</hi></p>
<p>The original plan for the project was that of collecting only the letters of Thomas Carlyle. It soon became clearly apparent, however, that Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s letters were essentially and vitally complementary to his, that the letters of each threw light on those of the other which could come from no other source, that each was the indispensable commentator on the other, and that the two correspondences gained much in interest and meaning when put side by side. Actually, to publish the two correspondences separately would mean unjustifiable proliferation of explanatory footnotes and a great waste of editorial apparatus. It would also impose an unnecessary inconvenience upon scholars dealing with a closely related body of literature who would repeatedly have to refer to two editions with two sets of indexes instead of one.</p>
<p>The problem of finding and getting copies of all the letters has not been an easy one. Even though more than half of the letters were in the National Library of Scotland, about four thousand fugitive letters scattered all over the world, in large lots and in small ones, had to be found. Finding those in large libraries like the British Museum, Harvard, Yale, and the Huntington was not difficult; but there are hundreds of letters, usually in very small lots, in many libraries and in many countries. Letters of inquiry had to be sent systematically to libraries and other depositories in Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Russia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and India, in addition to hundreds of libraries in the United States. A considerable number of letters, moreover, are in the hands of private collectors. It is not always easy to discover who they are; and, when found, these collectors are not always willing to have published the letters which they have collected. But most of the collectors of Carlyle letters who have been found have been very generous, some of them even magnanimous, <pb id="pg-01-xxvii" n="01:xxvii"/>in allowing their letters to be included in this edition. Some letters remain untraced if still extant, conspicuously some early letters written by Jane Welsh to Mrs. Basil Montagu and the letters by Carlyle to the Buller family, to Jeffrey, to William Fraser, and to Lord George Hill. From time to time additional letters come to light, but to find them is always a mixed pleasure, for to find some is to realize that there may be others in unexpected places. Every year, furthermore, some Carlyle letters come out of hiding and are sold on the market. The problem with these is to be able to buy them or at least get copies of them before some of them become lost again in the hands of unknown private collectors. It is not always easy to buy the letters, since the price of them has risen considerably in the last ten years. In <date when="1952-00-00">1952</date> a fairly long Carlyle letter could be bought for &#x24;25 or less; in <date when="1962-00-00">1962</date> a dealer quoted a two-page letter, already published, by Thomas Carlyle at &#x24;150, and a nine-page unpublished letter by Jane Welsh Carlyle at &#x24;325. In <date when="1969-00-00">1969</date> a four-page letter by Jane brought &#x24;672. Another difficulty lies in the fact that several of the correspondences of Carlyle with well-known people are being edited for publication by other scholars who do not wish to release the letters with which they are working until they have been published.</p>
<p>Facsimiles of all the letters of which the manuscripts have been found (about 90 per cent of the letters) are kept at Duke in a chronological file indexed by correspondents. These will be available for scholars to study after the edition has been published. Once the file has been assembled, however, the letters may still provide problems and difficulties. Jane&#x2019;s letters, in particular, are in a very unconventional form. Her handwriting is not particularly difficult, but she almost never dates her letters, her use of the capital letter is hard to relate to any fixed principle, and she punctuates chiefly with dashes. Despite his cramped hand, Carlyle&#x2019;s letters, nearly always dated, are reasonably legible. At times, however, he seemed vexed at having to write a letter and wrote &#x201C;In haste&#x201D; apologetically at the end. Often too he would get hold of a bad pen or bad paper and scold it, perhaps more than once in the letter. What a blessing a modern fountain pen would have been to him! He was not as careful and consistent as he could have been in forming his letters. Practically all his <hi rend="italic">K</hi>&#x2019;s seem to be in upper case. His <hi rend="italic">e</hi>&#x2019;s often close and look like undotted <hi rend="italic">i</hi>&#x2019;s, his <hi rend="italic">a</hi>&#x2019;s like <hi rend="italic">e</hi>&#x2019;s. His lower-case <hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2019;s also usually look like <hi rend="italic">i</hi>&#x2019;s without dots. The second <hi rend="italic">t</hi> of <hi rend="italic">tt</hi> and the second <hi rend="italic">l</hi> of <hi rend="italic">ll</hi> fall away and may be about half as high as they should be. The <hi rend="italic">a</hi>&#x2019;s are often not properly closed <pb id="pg-01-xxviii" n="01:xxviii"/>at the top. After <date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>, when Carlyle&#x2019;s right hand began to give him a great deal of trouble, he often used various symbols, not always easy to decipher, for omitted letters, such as <hi rend="italic">c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi></hi> for <hi rend="italic">could</hi> and <hi rend="italic">w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi></hi> for <hi rend="italic">would</hi>. Many letters by both Carlyles have additions, often cramped, in the margins, and occasionally one is cross-written. In the main, the manuscript letters have been well preserved, but some have holes or torn places in the paper. In others the ink has faded badly. And in still others there are missing pages.</p>
<p>It has appeared wise to the editors to retain the original punctuation and spelling of the letters, often without the use of <hi rend="italic">sic</hi> to indicate peculiarities and with additions and explanations in square brackets or in the notes when needed. In some instances, however, where there appears to be a special need for confirming the accuracy of a peculiar spelling or usage, <hi rend="italic">sic</hi> in square brackets follows the reading. Some names, such as James Johnston and William Graham, frequently and characteristically misspelled, have not been corrected. An occasional sentence beginning with a lower-case letter has been retained without capitalization. Superscript letters, which are more common in the later correspondence, have been lowered and letters have been supplied in square brackets when necessary for clearness. Dates supplied by the editors are invariably placed in square brackets. The writer&#x2019;s address is placed where he placed it, usually at the top of the letter on the right side, but sometimes at the end. The address of the addressee, given when the writer gives it and taken usually from the cover, is provided as the first item in the first note, a general note giving miscellaneous information and descriptive details concerning the letter. The name of the addressee is given at the top of the letter in its normal form without titles and repeated in the first note only if the writer wrote it in a peculiar or particularly interesting way. Words underscored by the writer are italicized, followed by a statement in square brackets when words are underscored more than once. Words cancelled by the authors are either omitted or commented on in the notes. The abbreviations used by the editors are the same as those in the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature</hi> and the annual bibliographies of <hi rend="italic">PMLA</hi> except for some special works relating to Carlyle studies, for which a key is provided at the beginning of each volume of letters. Editorial interpolations in square brackets are explained in the notes when such explanations seem called for. In general, every effort has been made to present the printed text <pb id="pg-01-xxix" n="01:xxix"/>in letter-perfect fidelity to the original letters so far as possible and with such illumination as the editors could provide.</p>
<p>Cross-references in the notes treat each letter as a unit without differentiation between the text of the letter and the footnotes, but readers pursuing the references will usually find that they save time by going to notes first and working up from them to the text of the letter. Since maps are included in the first volume, it has been assumed that place names which can easily be found on them do not need identification in the notes. The old spellings of the names are retained in the letters, on the maps, and in the index; but the modern spellings follow the old spellings in the index. Scotticisms are so numerous in the letters that it seems gratuitous to label them as such. Because the letters of both Carlyles are richly allusive, the editors have cited when possible the sources of the allusions, whether given as direct quotations or as echoes. References to Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays give the act and scene but not the line, since line numbering may vary from one edition to another. There have been times, admittedly, when the editors have been humbled by the allusions they could not trace, the notes which they could not write. In the main they have tried to suffer this humiliation in silence rather than to call attention to it in empty or negative notes.</p>
<p>Another question which the editors have had to face relates to what, if anything, in the correspondence may be omitted. Should short notes and snippets, perhaps undated, making appointments, accepting invitations, asking about health, seeking information about train schedules, be included? Should long and tedious passages dealing with technical details when a book is being put through the press or should repetitious details concerning health or the weather be left out? The editors have been forced to conclude that in a critical edition of the complete letters everything should be retained.</p>
<p>It is expected that each volume will contain about three hundred letters. Hence, the more than nine thousand letters which the edition will contain should require thirty or more volumes. In addition, index volumes must be provided. The present plan is to issue indexes from time to time with successive sets of volumes and to combine these into one index after the last volume has been published.</p>
<p>Biographical notes on more or less obscure persons, not easily found in the <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> or encyclopedias, are given in the notes in an appropriate context as soon as possible after they become noteworthy in the correspondence. The pages on which these notes are to be found, <pb id="pg-01-xxx" n="01:xxx"/>as well as Carlyle&#x2019;s pen portraits of his contemporaries, are indicated by bold type in the index. Well-known persons who have been written up in standard reference works are merely identified by their dates and perhaps by some brief information pertinent to their relation to the Carlyles and the correspondence.</p>
<lb/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">v</hi>. <hi rend="italic">The Characteristics, Value, and Significance of the Letters</hi></p>
<p>The letters of both Carlyles are not only rich in ideas but have a power of description remarkable for both sight and insight. Tedious passages may at times appear in Carlyle&#x2019;s letters, almost never in Jane&#x2019;s; but brilliance of metaphor and vigor of expression are the rule rather than the exception in all the letters, and in them the reader finds not merely sudden sentences but whole paragraphs and long passages of great literary splendor. Again and again the letters drive their point home, with a quick, sure thrust into the heart of whatever is being discussed. In them readers will always find a vivid and invaluable record of a changing world from <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date> to <date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>, as the scenes shift from time to time to Edinburgh, London, Manchester, Liverpool, the hills of Scotland and of Wales, country houses in southern England and sea resorts, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Paris, and Mentone. London, of course, predominates; and what other city since the time of ancient Athens has been as well described and preserved for posterity as Victorian London by Dickens and the two Carlyles? As the long, varied, and picturesque procession moved slowly forward before their eyes, the scenes were not merely observed and described but everything was evaluated, whether it was the burning of the Parliament buildings in <date when="1834-10-00">October 1834</date>, the appearance of Halley&#x2019;s comet in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>, the repeal of the Corn Laws, Dr. Gulley&#x2019;s watercure establishment at Malvern, the funeral cort&#xE8;ge of the Duke of Wellington, the opening of Mazzini&#x2019;s mail by the British government, the rise and fall of prime ministers, the great Reform Bills, the coming of beards about <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>, the Crimean War, the rise of the workingman, the coming of the railroads and penny postage, the growth of empire, the discoveries of scientists, the rise of Bismarck, new poems and novels as they were published by Tennyson, Browning, Arnold, Dickens, and Thackeray, controversies in religion, the doings of society at Holland House and Bath House, progress in the education of women and the masses, changes made in the Chelsea Embankment, or the death of Prince Albert. The letters reflect a keen interest in Germany and <pb id="pg-01-xxxi" n="01:xxxi"/>Russia as the Carlyles looked toward eastern Europe, in India, China, and Australia as they looked toward the Far East, and in the United States, Canada, and Latin America as they looked toward the West.</p>
<p>They are as valuable for the biographer as they are for the historian. No letters could be more fully self-revealing, and in them the Carlyles not only provided abundant materials for later biographers but also wrote their own autobiographies. If we do not altogether understand them after we have read their letters, it is not because they have been reticent or inarticulate but it is rather that like Hamlet they have a substantial opaqueness and remain significant specimens of enigmatic humanity even after they have repeatedly revealed themselves to us fully and even eloquently.</p>
<p>Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x2019;s letters unquestionably deserve the high opinion which Carlyle and many of the Carlyles&#x2019; contemporaries had of them. They are consistently, even in brief notes, ingenious, witty, and lively, with an electric fire constantly flashing out from them and with a quickness of perception and power of observation which reveal much in the world around her. Her predominant quality is verve, reflecting a vitality of mind and spirit truly remarkable in a woman often so ill that she said she felt like a snake trying to stand upright on its tail. Her view of life is not the less impressive because of a dash of cynicism that colors many of the letters and prevents her from seeing eye to eye with such an unmitigated and robust optimist as Robert Browning. People were her chief study, and though she was a kindhearted woman, at times almost sentimental in dealing with unfortunate persons, she was essentially a satirist whose eye could explore and whose tongue and pen could exploit the never-ending oddities, foibles, and shortcomings of human behavior. Her sense of the dramatic was keen, and her pen portraits, many of which in their own way are as delightful as Carlyle&#x2019;s, are usually not still pieces but dramatic revelations of character through anecdote and exaggeration. In her love for telling a good story reflecting the always amusing behavior of human beings, she realized that bald, straight narrative would never do, but that flavor and a flare for the dramatic were everything; and the flavor which she supplied most generously was that of black pepper. Sugar she kept in reserve and used occasionally, but sparingly.</p>
<p>Her resources of language were remarkable, involving abundant use of metaphor and great variety and cleverness in making use of the principle of association. Her use of &#x201C;coterie speech,&#x201D; which delighted <pb id="pg-01-xxxii" n="01:xxxii"/>Carlyle, certainly contributes one of the most distinctive qualities which her letters possess. The consummate skill with which she exploited coterie speech in her letters has been the subject of an extended study by Mrs. Janet Ray Edwards, who has assisted the Duke editorial staff in working on the letters.</p>
<p>Carlyle&#x2019;s letters are often much more than a record of the times with a running commentary. He was not content to be a mere observer of what was happening&#x2014;a sort of Greek chorus who observed the action and philosophized about it. He had strong practical instincts which are reflected in his books and are confirmed by Emerson&#x2019;s remarks upon his very appearance. When we speak of the remarkable influence which Carlyle exerted we should bear in mind, without discrediting at all the power of his books, that his letters and conversation were practical instruments by which he sought, often with success, to impinge upon the minds and control the behavior of people in clearly defined terms. The whole series of letters relating to the founding of the London Library in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> illustrates the point. Here he was completely successful, and we still rejoice at his success. He was less successful in his efforts to get Margaret Fuller and Emerson to bring <hi rend="italic">The Dial</hi> out of the clouds and down to earth (see the letter to Emerson of <date when="1842-08-19">19 August 1842</date>). He was less successful, too, fortunately, in his advising the poets of the age to give up verse and write prose. Carlyle was too forthright to be completely successful politically and too individual to create disciples in his own image. But he did, partly through his letters, shock the aristocrats and the middle class out of their smugness and moral indifference; and at his best he did for some individuals what was much better than shaping them to be like himself: he taught them how to find and how to be truly themselves.</p>
<p>John Burroughs, Logan Pearsall Smith, and others have called Carlyle the Victorian Rembrandt. Certainly, no instinct in him was stronger than that which led him to observe with burning interest and intensified powers of observation men and women in the world around him. No talent in him was more marked than that through which he skilfully delineated their features. The influence of Chaucer was always strong upon him. Whatever value the world may attach to his moral and political ideas (just now his reputation as a philosopher is clearly at ebb tide), the portraits which he drew of his contemporaries will always be too important and too fascinating to be ignored by students of the period.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-xxxiii" n="01:xxxiii"/>Some of Carlyle&#x2019;s pen portraits are to be found in such works as <hi rend="italic">The Life of Sterling</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>. Most of them, however, and some of the best ones are miniatures embedded in the letters, many of which have been published only in part or not at all. Hence it is that we shall never be able to study and enjoy Carlyle&#x2019;s work as the &#x201C;Victorian Rembrandt&#x201D; in its entire range, variety, and richness until we can see all the portraits in relationship to one another and to the times against the context of the collected and ordered correspondence.</p>
<p>A particular reason why Carlyle&#x2019;s portraits yield most when studied in relation to the letters is that his method was that of a painter who required his subjects to sit a considerable number of times. Carlyle&#x2019;s portraits grow, develop, are touched up, gather depth of shadow and richness of coloring, find their true proportions and emphasis, and at times undergo organic change and readjustment of line as the artist realizes his opportunity to observe his subject from time to time and sends off letter after letter. Those who wish evidence for this assertion may study his treatment of Samuel Rogers, Tennyson, Macaulay, and Thackeray.</p>
<p>Despite Carlyle&#x2019;s scoffing at &#x201C;artists&#x201D; and &#x201C;dilettantism&#x201D; (a word to him synonymous with all aesthetic studies), he was himself greatest when he was most the artist. And he was undoubtedly an artist&#x2014;a conscious artist&#x2014;when he worked on the portraits. Whether studying history or observing his contemporaries, his first object always was to get an actual likeness of indisputable authenticity of the persons to be considered. He praised Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, for first collecting the best painted portraits of important Englishmen and later drawing brilliant portraits with his pen. In the early <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>&#x2019;s he showed himself strongly in favor of establishing national portrait galleries for Scotland and England, for which the pictures would be carefully selected and in which only the most trustworthy portraits would be found. When he wrote history, whether it dealt with the French Revolution, Cromwell, or Frederick II, he first searched for authentic likenesses of all important characters in the story and placed these on or near his desk where he could see them as he wrote. He grieved that there was nowhere a true portrait of Christ; the works of the great Italian masters were to him idealizations, glorifications, luminous pieces of ecclesiastical symbolism, and romantic imaginings which were to him a poor substitute for a real likeness.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Carlyle knew that a merely photographic likeness could never be an adequate portrait. It had to begin, of course, <pb id="pg-01-xxxiv" n="01:xxxiv"/>with the physically real or it would be completely false. But having once grasped this reality clearly and firmly, it proceeded to discover and reveal the inner and essential reality of which the physical details merely provided the outward tokens. Such a method, making much of swift evaluations, rigorous exclusion of unessentials, and a form which was compact, picturesque, and bright, Carlyle believed he had inherited from his father. One of his father&#x2019;s most notable gifts, he said, was that of throwing off &#x201C;little sketches of Annandale biography &#x2026; clearest brief portraiture and life-history of all the noteworthy, vanished figures whom I had known by look only, and now wished to understand &#x2026; so admirably brief, luminous, true, and man-like.&#x201D; The word <hi rend="italic">man-like</hi> here is not used loosely. Carlyle uses the word <hi rend="italic">man</hi> as Hamlet does in praising his father. Carlyle says that his father gave him a set of &#x201C;human delineations of human life.&#x201D; Thus, the chief purpose of the portrait artist is to find the precious and indefinable humanity in his subject, to distil it and draw it out, through methods permitted by a rigorous economy, until it hangs like a rare, rich, and exquisite perfume over and around the portrait. Here lies the charm of Rembrandt&#x2019;s work, and of Carlyle&#x2019;s when he is most successful.</p>
<p>Carlyle&#x2019;s metaphors are merely one of the most striking means which he employs, but they are often like brilliant jewels flashing out from the portraits, and they do much to render the portraits unforgettable. Bronson Alcott, with his vegetarianism, is a &#x201C;Potato Quixote&#x201D;; Coleridge is a &#x201C;seventy-four-gun ship, but waterlogged, dismasted, cannot set a thread of sail!&#x201D;; Thomas Erskine of Linlathen was like a &#x201C;draught of sweet rustic <hi rend="italic">mead</hi> served in cut glasses and silver tray&#x201D;; Margaret Fuller&#x2019;s books suggest a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">spiritual Aurora Borealis</hi>&#x201D;; she does not use words but rather expresses herself through &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">symbolical</hi> tunes on the bagpipe&#x201D;; hers is a &#x201C;predetermination to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> this big Universe as her oyster or her egg&#x201D;; Leigh Hunt is a &#x201C;talking nightingale&#x201D;; Samuel Rogers has a &#x201C;toothless horse-shoe mouth drawn up to the very nose&#x201D;; and Southey, whose &#x201C;grand bodily <supplied>[characteristic]</supplied> is leanness and long legs,&#x201D; is when he rises &#x201C;like a lean pair of tongs.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A surprising number of the metaphors in Carlyle&#x2019;s characterizations refer, like those in <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>, to animals and birds. They are used, for instance, to intensify the unfavorable impression which he had received of Charles Babbage, the mechanical genius and mathematician: &#x201C;Babbage continues eminently unpleasant to me, with his frog mouth and viper eyes, with his hide-bound, wooden irony, and the acridest egotism looking through it.&#x201D; Jeremy Bentham is &#x201C;a rhinoceros&#x2014;strong <pb id="pg-01-xxxv" n="01:xxxv"/>and clumsy.&#x201D; Benjamin Jowett is &#x201C;a poor little good-humoured owlet of a body,&#x2014;&#x2018;Oxford Liberal,&#x2019; and very conscious of being so; now knowing right hand from left otherwise.&#x201D; Two leading Oxford High Churchmen fare even worse than Jowett: &#x201C;Your two Oxford &#x2018;Dignitaries&#x2019; are interesting scarecrows; hard to say which is uglier,&#x2014;Pusey with his praying [?] suffering contracted weazel countenance, Sewel<supplied>[l]</supplied> with his small triumphant ferret one.&#x201D; Emerson&#x2019;s visit to Craigenputtoch in <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date> was like that of an angel, Carlyle told Longfellow; but Emerson&#x2019;s face, he said to Lady Ashburton in <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>, was like that of a cock. G. H. Lewes, to Carlyle another extremely ugly man, is &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Ape</hi> Lewes&#x201D; or &#x201C;hairy Lewes, rather ludicrous in his role of gallant, Adonis, and conqueror of hearts in George Eliot&#x2019;s life drama.&#x201D; Although Carlyle had some praise for Walt Whitman after reading <hi rend="italic">Democratic Vistas</hi>, in general he could not like him: &#x201C;If you could endow the parish bull with the faculty of human utterance and holding a pen between the halves of his hoof, <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, I imagine, is much the thing he would write,&#x201D; he wrote to Charles Eliot Norton of Whitman&#x2019;s poetry. When he visited Connop Thirlwall in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, he was greatly but not altogether favorably impressed by Thirlwall&#x2019;s chaplain, whom he describes as follows: &#x201C;Turned of forty; lean and yellow; has boiled big eyes; a neck head and nose giving you a notion of a gigantic human Snipe. Is not that a beauty? &#x2026; We are alone all but this Sucker-Chaplain or Snipe.&#x201D; Although these comparisons with animals and birds often bring out unfavorable or unpleasant features and characteristics of Carlyle&#x2019;s subjects, Monckton Milnes&#x2019; cheerful good-nature, liveliness, and smallness of stature are all suggested by Carlyle&#x2019;s delightful description of him as &#x201C;a pretty little robin-redbreast of a man.&#x201D; Sometimes the metaphor may be involved in dramatic action, as in the following account of Carlyle&#x2019;s clash with the well-known radical, J. A. Roebuck:</p>
<q>He is practising as Advocate now, that little Roebuck, as lean, acrid, contentious and loquacious as ever. He flew at me, do what I would, some three or four times, like a kind of cockatrice,&#x2014;had to be swept back again; far more to the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> entertainment than to mine. He does not fly into a shriek like Maurice, that is his quality; but he is a very impertinent little unproductive gentleman; and I suppose has <hi rend="italic">made</hi> many a man incline to shriek. We parted good friends,&#x2014;with small wish on my part or his to meet again.</q> 
<p>Carlyle looked for what was solid and substantial in personality and for what yielded practical results in human activities. One extremely <pb id="pg-01-xxxvi" n="01:xxxvi"/>valuable practical result was that which brought order out of chaos. Writing to his brother Alexander in Canada on <date when="1847-07-03">3 July 1847</date>, Carlyle said: &#x201C;And train the children, each in its own little garden, to respect fruit-trees, honourable profit, <hi rend="italic">industry, beauty</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">good-order</hi>: it is the summary of all Gospels to man!&#x201D; Were these merely the values which strengthened and confirmed the Victorian middle class, Matthew Arnold&#x2019;s Philistines, in their ways? Carlyle includes beauty in his short list of highest values. The question whether he himself had a deficient sense of beauty is an important one, but it is much too difficult and complex to be dealt with adequately here. Two brief comments on the subject may be helpful. In the first place, Carlyle did not like to talk about beauty or hear others talk about it. He did not believe that those who talked about beauty most were sure to reach the level of the highest artists any more than that those who talk about Heaven most are sure to go there. In the second place, his sense of beauty was very much like Browning&#x2019;s. Reality was highly complex to both, and they frequently discovered beauty amid surroundings which appeared strange, uncongenial, even grotesque. They sought for reality first and would not sift it in order to find and keep apart the pure grains of beauty. Nevertheless, many of Carlyle&#x2019;s portraits are lit up by intensely lovely flashes of beauty. As for order, the instinct for it was highly developed in Carlyle&#x2019;s nature. In the age of the Gothic revival, he cared nothing for Westminster Abbey but carried down to old age the feeling of wonder and admiration with which he first gazed upon St. Paul&#x2019;s. &#x201C;It was and is,&#x201D; he told Allingham in <date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>, &#x201C;the grandest building I ever saw.&#x201D; And he never grew tired of praising his wife for the skilful management which made it possible for him to live in an orderly household in Chelsea. Such values as these compose the essential fabric of ideas in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>.</p>
<p>And undoubtedly they count for much in the portraits. Samuel Wilberforce, he believed, had neither individual integrity nor substantiality in his nature; and so Carlyle dismisses him as one who &#x201C;has got all he has by pure soapiness, suppleness, and sycophancy.&#x201D; Witty spoof was no better substitute than frothy soapsuds for substantiality.</p>
<p>Hence Carlyle&#x2019;s rejection of Sydney Smith as an extremely boring person with an everlasting desire and effort to be witty. Hence also one of Carlyle&#x2019;s even more shocking heresies, his rejection of Charles Lamb. This, like his uncharitable comments on Shelley, Keats, and Coleridge, cannot be justified, but shows us Carlyle at his worst, when artistic subjectivity allowed ignorance, prejudice, and intolerance to <pb id="pg-01-xxxvii" n="01:xxxvii"/>warp and even distort the portrait. He was thrown with Lamb more than once on his visit to London in <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date> and was always filled with disgust. Here is a passage from a letter of <date when="1831-08-29">29 August 1831</date>:</p>
<q>We saw Charlie Lamb (<hi rend="italic">Elia</hi>) at tea: a miserable, drink-besotted, spindle-shanked skeleton of a body; whose &#x201C;humour&#x201D;, as it is called, seemed to me neither more nor less than a fibre of genius shining thro&#x2019; positive delirium and crackbrainedness (<foreign><hi rend="italic">verr&#xfc;cktheit</hi></foreign>), and would be to me the most intolerable of all nuisances.</q> 
<p>After seeing more of Lamb, he made a detailed entry in his <hi rend="italic">Notebook</hi> (<date when="1831-11-02">2 November 1831</date>):</p>
<q>How few people speak for Truth&#x2019;s sake, even in its humblest modes! I return from Enfield, where I have seen Lamb, &#x26;c., &#x26;c. Not one of that class will tell you a straightforward story, or even a credible one, about any matter under the sun. All must be perked up into epigrammatic contrasts, startling exaggerations, claptraps that will get a plaudit from the galleries! I have heard a hundred anecdotes about W. Hazlitt (for example); yet cannot, by never so much cross-questioning even, form to myself the smallest notion of how it really stood with him.&#x2014; Wearisome, inexpressibly wearisome to me is that sort of clatter: it is not walking (to the end of time you would never advance, for these persons indeed have no <hi rend="small-caps">whither</hi>); it is not bounding and frisking in graceful natural joy; it is dancing&#x2014;a St. Vitus dance. Heighho!&#x2014;</q>
<q>Charles Lamb I sincerely believe to be in some considerable degree <hi rend="italic">insane</hi>. A more pitiful, ricketty, gasping, staggering, stammering Tom fool I do not know. He is witty by denying truisms, and abjuring good manners. His speech wriggles hither and thither with an incessant painful fluctuation; not an opinion in it or a fact or even a phrase that you can thank him for: more like a convulsion fit than natural systole and diastole.&#x2014; Besides he is now a confirmed shameless drunkard; <hi rend="italic">asks</hi> vehemently for gin-and-water in strangers&#x2019; houses; tipples till he is utterly mad, and is only not thrown out of doors because he is too much despised for taking such trouble with him. Poor Lamb! Poor England where such a despicable abortion is named genius!&#x2014; He said: There are just two things I regret in English History; first that Guy Faux&#x2019;s plot did not take effect (there would have been so glorious an <hi rend="italic">explosion</hi>); second that the Royalists did not hang Milton (then we might have laughed at them); &#x26;c., &#x26;c.</q> 
<p>He never changed his mind about Lamb. Many years later he spoke to Duffy about Lamb&#x2019;s &#x201C;fantastic method of looking at things.&#x201D; There was no practical sense in him, Carlyle said, and he had formed the habit of turning into quips and jests whatever turned up; hence he was an ill example to younger men, who had to live their lives in a world which was altogether serious. In the late <date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>&#x2019;s he still refused <pb id="pg-01-xxxviii" n="01:xxxviii"/>to yield to the slightest degree after W. H. Wylie warmly maintained that Lamb&#x2019;s humor was admirable. Lamb had no humor, Carlyle said; he had &#x201C;only a thin streak of Cockney wit.&#x201D; He had known &#x201C;scores of Scotch moorland farmers, who for <hi rend="italic">humour</hi> could have blown Lamb into the zenith!&#x201D; The only thing really humorous about Lamb was his personal appearance: &#x201C;His suit of rusty black, his spindle-shanks, his knee-breeches, the bit ribbons fleein&#x2019; at the knees o&#x2019; him: indeed he was humour personified!&#x201D; And Carlyle ended, &#x201C;<foreign>Puir silly cratur!</foreign>&#x201D;</p>
<p>Shelley, whom Carlyle never saw, he found even less substantial than Lamb. He was a poor, shrieking creature who had said or sung nothing worth remembering. Carlyle was both blunt and frank in a letter to Browning of about <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>, when Browning still had almost unreserved enthusiasm for Shelley:</p>
<q>I am not sure but you would excommunicate me if I told you all I thought of Shelley. Poor soul, he has always seemed to me an extremely weak creature; a poor, thin, spasmodic, hectic shrill and pallid being. &#x2026; The very voice of him (his style, &#x26;c.) shrill, shrieky, to my ear has too much of the ghost!</q> 
<p>To Milnes he described Shelley in similar terms: &#x201C;Shelley is always mistaking spasmodic violence for strength. I know no more <hi rend="italic">urned</hi> books than his. It is like the writing of a ghost, uttering infinite wail into the night, unable to help itself or anyone else.&#x201D; Keats, Carlyle believed, though not without substance, was a spoiled child begging for sweets. Coleridge was a ship without a rudder. To Carlyle, Swinburne was unsubstantial like Lamb and Shelley. His verses were froth, &#x201C;a fuzz of words,&#x201D; and there was &#x201C;not the least intellectual value in anything he writes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Yet the high value which Carlyle placed on humor does something to make amends after the worst has been said about his portraits. Much has been written about his own vein of humor, his indebtedness to Swift and Sterne, and the power which his own loud, rich outbursts of laughter had to delight those who heard him talk. When George Bancroft visited him in <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>, Carlyle was pleased to find in him &#x201C;a certain small under-current of genial <hi rend="italic">humour</hi>, or as it were <hi rend="italic">hidden laughter</hi>, not noticed heretofore.&#x201D; He enjoyed the humor in Sir David Wilkie&#x2019;s pictures. They contained, he said, &#x201C;a great broad energy of humor and sympathy.&#x201D; Wilkie was a real painter, &#x201C;alone among us since Hogarth&#x2019;s time.&#x201D; Carlyle also enjoyed humor in Dickens, in his readings especially. In Dickens, as in Garrick, the genius for humor manifested itself mainly in mimicry. In Jane Welsh Carlyle, too, one of <pb id="pg-01-xxxix" n="01:xxxix"/>the qualities most endearing to him was her alert, sure sense of the ridiculous and her habit of exploding nonsense with laughter. A fine sense of humor was also in Carlyle&#x2019;s early friend and benefactor, Edward Strachey, grandfather of Lytton Strachey, to whom the grandfather may have bequeathed something. Carlyle describes him as one who above all things &#x201C;loved Chaucer, and kept reading him.&#x201D; He was the colleague of Thomas Love Peacock and worked near him, so that the two were often found laughing together over the absurdities of the world. He had &#x201C;a fine, tinkling, mellow-toned voice&#x201D; and &#x201C;a pretty vein of quiz.&#x201D; Humor was a part of the armor with which he faced the world:</p>
<q><supplied>[He was]</supplied> a man sharply impatient of pretence, of sham and untruth in all forms; especially contemptuous of &#x201C;quality&#x201D; pretensions and affectations, which he scattered grinningly to the winds. Dressed in the simplest for; <supplied>[he]</supplied> walked daily to the India House and back <supplied>[to Fitzroy Square]</supplied>, though there were fine carriages in store for the woman part; scorned cheerfully &#x201C;the general humbug of the world,&#x201D; and honestly strove to do his own bit of duty, spiced by Chaucer and what else of inward harmony or condiment he had. &#x2026; A man of many qualities: comfortable to be near.</q> 
<p>To Carlyle, the greatest wit of the day was Charles Buller, nephew of Strachey&#x2019;s wife and Carlyle&#x2019;s own pupil in the early Edinburgh days. Buller&#x2019;s wit, according to Carlyle, was not based on pure nonsense and insubstantiality like that of Charles Lamb. Buller was a man of great practical abilities, of integrity, of &#x201C;a constant veracity of intellect and character.&#x201D; Neither was it like the contrived wit of Sydney Smith, ostentatious and affected. It was a natural stream of brilliance flowing from the mind, &#x201C;an airy winged turn of thought, flowing out in lambencies of beautiful spontaneous wit and fancy.&#x201D; Buller expressed his inborn detestation of the base and false by &#x201C;showering witty scorn upon it, &#x2026; in which, indeed, I never saw his rival.&#x201D; Yet Buller&#x2019;s was &#x201C;a kindly, genial nature; clear, productive, with a rare union of decision and benignity.&#x201D; He died young in late <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>, with what appeared to be a brilliant career in the direction of colonial affairs ahead of him. At his death Carlyle wrote to Lady Ashburton, <date when="1848-11-29">29 November 1848</date>:</p>
<q>Alas, alas, what sad tragedy is this,&#x2014;the saddest, I think, that ever befel among friends of mine! &#x2026; And we shall never see that blithe face more. &#x2026; His presence was cheering and beneficient to all, and hurtful or afflictive to none that lived. But to you, dear Friend,&#x2014;alas, it is a loss which I fear none of us can ever repair! In his own form <pb id="pg-01-xl" n="01:xl"/>he was by far the brightest Soul in your circle; or indeed in all the world, that I know of.</q>
<p>Buller&#x2019;s humor was not merely intelligent and clever; it was the product of a remarkable humanity, fully vitalized, glowing, warm, and substantial.</p>
<p>The indefinable humanity which Carlyle found in Buller counts for much in various portraits as the artist evaluated his subjects. Carlyle sought it out wherever it could be found, had a quick eye to discover it or the lack of it, judged his subjects according to the degree of it which they possessed, and had great skill in suggesting in the portraits precisely how much humanity his subjects possessed. Here again his portraits remind us of Rembrandt&#x2019;s. This quality of humanity he thought of in the way that traditional humanism has always thought of it, both as whatever in man&#x2019;s nature may raise him above the level of the lower animals and as whatever liberates his faculties, allowing the natural man to function, and displaying him, fully alive, as a creature of the earth. Jesus he praised as &#x201C;that grandest of all beings&#x201D; who have helped to make us something better than &#x201C;wild beasts of rapine and havoc.&#x201D; Goethe he acclaimed as &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, not a <hi rend="italic">dwarf</hi> of <hi rend="italic">letters</hi>.&#x201D; &#x201C;Be men,&#x201D; he said to the other authors of the day, &#x201C;before attempting to be <hi rend="italic">writers</hi>.&#x201D; To friends in his old age he said that he had &#x201C;tried to put some humanity&#x201D; into Frederick II but that it was hard work. One of his early disappointments came from his discovery of what seemed to be a fundamental lack of humanity in the poet Thomas Campbell, whose poems he had read with admiration. The poet had a smirk on his face like that of an auctioneer; his eye had &#x201C;the cold vivacity of a conceited worldling his talk is small, contemptuous, and shallow: <supplied>[every detail of his dress]</supplied> proclaimed the literary dandy.&#x201D; &#x201C;The aspect of that man jarred the music of my mind for a whole day,&#x201D; Carlyle declared. There is no living well of thought or feeling in him; his head is a shop not a manufactory; and for his heart, it is dry as a Greenock <hi rend="italic">kipper</hi>.&#x201D; The same fundamental deficiency appeared in John Wilson Croker. Carlyle wrote in <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>, &#x201C;No viler mortal calls himself man than old Croker at this time&#x201D;; and he objected to an attack on Maurice, Kingsley, and other liberals which he had read in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> as &#x201C;very beggarly Crokerism, all of copperas and gall and human <hi rend="italic">baseness</hi>.&#x201D; Lacking humanity too was the geologist Sir Charles Lyell, with his monotonous, uninspired voice and &#x201C;the clear leaden twinkle of his small bead eyes.&#x201D; When Carlyle visited <pb id="pg-01-xli" n="01:xli"/>Sir William and Lady Beecher in County Cork, Ireland, he was astonished to find in Lady Beecher, formerly the famous actress Eliza O&#x2019;Neill, no suggestion of human warmth or gracious hospitality, but instead cold rigidity and formality. Her eyes were cold and cruel. Her air was silent, reserved, disagreeable. She sternly and rigorously imposed her character upon her whole household. She lived in constant obedience to what she called her duty and was a thrall to the Thirty-nine Articles. Very different to Carlyle was a true saint, Martin Luther. When he saw a picture of Luther which he admired in Germany, he exclaimed: &#x201C;Martin himself has a fine German face: eyes so frank and serious, a look as if he could take a cup of ale as well as wrestle down the devil in a handsome manner.&#x201D; True humanity is never stiff or stuffy. One of the first Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s tributes to Carlyle himself is significant here. After a visit to Oxford in <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>, she said, &#x201C;Coming back to the society of Carlyle after the dons at Oxford is like returning home from some conventional world to the human race.&#x201D; It is pleasant to know that Carlyle found plenty of unmistakable humanity in Turgenev, whom he got to know on his visits to England. He said, &#x201C;A fine faculty is in that Russian big man; the heart of him somewhat too <hi rend="italic">sensual</hi>, but full of noble melancholy, and fine qualities.&#x201D; Turgenev was good company and an excellent talker. Carlyle&#x2019;s skill in suggesting what is indefinable in humanity is perhaps nowhere illustrated better than in his description of a corpse which he saw in Paris in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>:</p>
<q>I turned aside into a small mansion with the name of <hi rend="italic">Morgue</hi> upon it; there lay the naked body of an old grey-headed artisan whom misery had driven to drown himself in the river! His face wore the grim fixed scowl of despair; his lean horny hands with their long ragged nails were lying by his sides; his patched and soiled apparel with his apron and <hi rend="italic">sabots</hi> were hanging at his head; and there fixed in his iron slumber, heedless of the vain din that rolled around him on every side, was this poor outcast stretched in silence and darkness forever. I gazed upon the wretch for a quarter of an hour; I think I never felt more shocked in my life.</q>
<p>As Carlyle paints the picture, the death of the artisan is merely the last stroke in a long succession of blows by which the struggling man was beaten back and denied the possibility of fulfilling himself as a human being. It is well to note here, furthermore, that the many important questions which Carlyle raised concerning modern industrialized society have to do largely with its dehumanizing tendencies.</p>
<p>The touch which counts for most in Carlyle&#x2019;s portraits, however, <pb id="pg-01-xlii" n="01:xlii"/>is a magic one which defies analysis. With it he makes us suddenly aware that his subject belongs not to the earth merely but is a creature of infinitude, staring out at us from a strange, mysterious place where immensity and eternity meet. We are filled with awe and wonder, and exclaim with Hamlet: &#x201C;What a piece of work is man!&#x201D; This gift for suggesting the close conjunction of the natural with the supernatural seems to have been born in Carlyle. It operated in his treatment of places as well as of persons. It sometimes frightened him. He wrote in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>:</p>
<q>Sure enough I have a fatal talent of converting all Nature into Preternaturalism for myself: a truly horrible Phantasm-Reality it is to me; what of heavenly radiances it has, blended in close neighbourhood, in intimate union, with the hideousness of Death and Chaos;&#x2014;a very ghastly business indeed.</q>
<p>But this very gift accounts for the splendidly luminous quality of his portraits of Coleridge in his <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> and of Jeffrey and Jane Welsh Carlyle in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>. It suggests, furthermore, a scale of values which refused to come to terms with the prevailing science, industrialism, and materialism. In the words of one of his contemporaries, &#x201C;The marvels of industry did not awe him, the progress of humanity he did not place in the triumphs of matter; in his eyes a man was a man only on condition of being a tabernacle of the living God.&#x201D; The shadows which are so important in Carlyle&#x2019;s portraits, as in Rembrandt&#x2019;s, not merely suggest depth but reveal to us earthly creatures partaking of eternity and infinitude.</p>
<p>The importance of Carlyle&#x2019;s work in handing down to posterity portraits of his contemporaries cannot be exaggerated. The scope and range of the gallery of Victorian portraits which he has bequeathed to us are tremendous. He was consciously trying to do for those of us who come after him what he wished had always been done for him by those who came before him. His portraits vary greatly, not only according to their subjects, but also in the methods which he used in dealing with them. Some are made up merely of a bold stroke or two, with charcoal on white paper. Many others are more full and complex but are in the brief, bright, compact manner of Chaucer&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Prologue</hi>. In this group we find portraits of Lady Holland, William Godwin, Samuel Rogers, Robert Southey, Sir James Stephen, Thiers, Daniel Webster, Hartley Coleridge, Bronson Alcott, Mazzini, Gladstone, Disraeli, and many others. A third group of portraits is that dealing with <pb id="pg-01-xliii" n="01:xliii"/>subjects who completely fascinated him or who had gripped his mind, imagination, and emotions strongly. These portraits, much fuller than any of the others, he returned to again and again through his various published writings and letters. They are thus composites of passages which he wrote through the years as his mind returned to them and his experience presented them to him from time to time in a fresh light. Such are his splendid portraits of his own father, James Carlyle, of Jane Welsh Carlyle, of Edward Irving, of Francis Jeffrey, of S. T. Coleridge, of John Sterling, of Browning, of Dickens, of Emerson, of Leigh Hunt, of Macaulay, of J. S. Mill, of Ruskin, of Thackeray, of Tennyson, of Wordsworth, and of Queen Victoria. Those who jump to the conclusion that Carlyle&#x2019;s portraits always lack charity and are distorted by prejudice should study the careful discrimination and remarkable balance in the portraits of Irving, Jeffrey, and Sterling, and the affectionate tolerance and warm friendliness which run through the many sketches of Leigh Hunt. We may be willing to forgive Carlyle for much when we remember that he could appreciate Jeffrey and could love Leigh Hunt, even though both were radically different from him in temperament and philosophy.</p>
<p>One further observation may be helpful to the reader. He must not expect too much from the very earliest letters, beginning as they do with a letter from a schoolgirl of eleven and letters from a somewhat pedantic and self-conscious student still in his teens. The strong claims made in this Introduction for the literary value of the letters are based on the whole range of the letters. The alert reader, however, will soon find that his patience is not being unduly tried, for delightful literary qualities are not long in appearing, and from the very beginning he has an inside view into university and family life in Scotland and of Edinburgh flourishing in the days of John Wilson, Francis Jeffrey, and Sir Walter Scott. The young Carlyle reads and comments on the Waverley novels as soon as they appear and enjoys the excitement of reading <hi rend="italic">Don Juan</hi> as it comes out in instalments. Fired by the romance in his blood, he is by <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>, when he meets Jane Welsh, ready to contribute his part to the love letters, which may be counted on to dispel any vestige of boredom that may have remained up to their beginning. Henceforth the fabric of the correspondence is rich and varied indeed. Taken as a whole, the letters have a vital unity and unfold a story resembling that of an enormous multi-volumed, crowded-canvas, cross-section-of-life, realistic novel, swarming with major and minor characters, containing much dialogue, and having a <pb id="lastpage-01-xliv" n="01:xliv"/>moving and complex plot with subplots and auxiliary anecdotes, and with many bright comic colors providing relief for some deeply tragic shadows. Hence it is possible that the Carlyle letters may prove to be among the most readable in English literary history.</p>

Jane Baillie Welsh, only daughter of Dr. John Welsh and Grace Welsh, first cousins, was born <date when="1801-07-14">14 July 1801</date> and was eleven when this, her first surviving letter, was written.

Mary Welsh was Jane&#x2019;s aunt by marriage, wife of John Welsh, her mother&#x2019;s brother, and mother of the Liverpool cousins Helen, Jeannie (&#x201C;Babbie&#x201D;), Margaret (&#x201C;Maggie&#x201D;), Mary, Walter, Alexander, and John, who appear often in the correspondence later.

Thomas Murray (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>) and Carlyle first met on the way to Edinburgh University in <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>. By his own early example Murray was one of the first to foster in Carlyle the possibility of living by literature. Murray was kept busy with &#x201C;pedagogies&#x201D; for a time, was an early contributor to the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Brewster&#x2019;s Encyclopaedia</hi>, published <hi rend="italic">The Literary History of Galloway</hi> ( <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>), the <hi rend="italic">Letters of David Hume</hi>, which he edited in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, and other works of a biographical nature. Despairing of ever getting a church of his own, he turned first to private teaching, and in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> opened a small printing business in Edinburgh. See Norton, <hi rend="italic">EL</hi>, and Murray&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Autobiographical Notes</hi>, ed. John A. Fairley (Dumfries, <date when="1911-00-00">1911</date>).

<salute>Dear Murray,</salute>
<p>I return you my sincerest thanks for the kind letter, you favoured me with &#x26; for the punctual manner in which you executed my requests. <pb id="pg-01-4" n="01:4"/>In fact I don&#x2019;t know how to write to you, for shame at not writing you long ago: I can assure you however, that every day, since

putting my intention in execution.&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dear Mitchell,</salute>
<p>You are perhaps thinking by this time, that I am slow in answering your long-sollicited letter; and before going further, I must beg pardon, and plead the trite excuses of business, indolence &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;and let me tell you, you have been such a notorious offender in that way, yourself.&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t have the impudence to make any complaints.</p>
<p>Were I disposed to moralise, there is before me the finest field that ever opened to the eye of mortal man.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Nap the Mighty,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Napoleon abdicated <date when="1814-04-11">11 April 1814</date> at Fontainebleau and was sent to Elba. Robert Mitchell wrote to Carlyle on <date when="1814-04-09">9 April</date>: &#x201C;They say the Allies have entered Paris&#x2014; Contrast the Campaign of <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date> with that of <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2014; Then the French were in Moscow; now the Russians are in Paris&#x2014; &#x2018;Every dog has his day&#x2019; as the old Barber says&#x2014; Whither do you think it was more owing to the good conduct of the Allies or to the bad policy of Buonaparte that &#x2026; he has met with this sad reverse of fortune.&#x201D; In reply to Carlyle&#x2019;s present letter Mitchell wrote on <date when="1814-05-30">30 May</date>: &#x201C;Your moralizations <hi rend="italic">on Nap</hi> are certainly not of the Common Kind; and give me leave to tell you, I have heard &#x26; read several things on the Subject; yet not one of your <hi rend="italic">fine things</hi> was ever spoken or wrote by one of them. To me his going into <hi rend="italic">Limbo</hi> appears a very odd thing&#x2014;surely he is not so heroic as he always pretended to be; or else it is only another winding of his crooked and subtile policy.&#x201D;</note> who, <pb id="pg-01-7" n="01:7"/>but a few months ago, made the sovereigns of Europe tremble at his nod; who has trampled on thrones and sceptres, and kings and priests and principalities and powers, and carried ruin and havoc and blood and fire, from Gibralter to Archangel&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Nap the Mighty</hi> is&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">gone to pot</hi> [<hi rend="italic">gone to pot</hi> is underscored twice]!!!&#x2014; &#x201C;I will plant my eagles on the towers of Lishbon&#x201D;; &#x201C;I will conquer Europe and crush great Britain to the centre of the terraqueous globe&#x201D;&#x2014;I will go to Elba&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">and be coop&#x2019;d up</hi> in Limbo!!! &#x2018;But yesterday; and <hi rend="italic">Boney</hi> might have stood against the world; now none so poor as do him rev&#x2019;rence.&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Julius Caesar</hi>, III, ii.</note>&#x2014;&#x2018;Strange&#x2019; says Sancho Panza &#x2018;very strange things happen in the boiling of an egg.&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cervantes was a lifelong favorite with Carlyle. A few years later he and Jane learned Spanish and read <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> in the original language at the time when <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> was in the period of incubation. &#x201C;Descendentalism&#x201D; in it owes something to Sancho Panza&#x2019;s down-to-earth realism, and the whole work owes much to the baroque qualities in Cervantes&#x2019; book.</note>&#x2014;all those fine things, however, and twenty thousand others have been thought, and said by every body who thinks or speaks upon the subject&#x2014;and so I leave them.</p>
<p>Having got out of this r<supplied>[h]</supplied>apsody, I now proceed to consider the contents of your letter.&#x2014; It gives me the sincerest sorrow, that you <hi rend="italic">did not</hi> [<hi rend="italic">not</hi> is underscored twice] accomplish that redoubtable undertaking in which you were engaged<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell had written of his dreams of fame by succeeding in trisecting an angle.</note> There is a real pleasure attends those same castles which all of us so often build, and tho&#x2019; &#x2018;like the baseless fabric of a vision,&#x2019; they must &#x2018;all dissolve and leave not a

Still <hi rend="italic">your</hi> atchievement (even had it come that length) was but like the drop on the bucket to some of <hi rend="italic">my projected</hi> exploits&#x2014;&#x2019; Twas but the other day, for instance, that I had got into a sure and expeditious way of boring a hole, right, slap, souse down thro&#x2019; the centre of the earth we inhabit, and receiving point blanc the productions of New Zealand and the South Sea!!!! as I will be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at least <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of the summer, I cannot but highly approve of the plan you proposed of sending <pb id="pg-01-8" n="01:8"/>our essays<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In practice this proposal of Mitchell&#x2019;s did not get very far.</note> to be remarked on by each other. It is impossible that it <hi rend="italic">could</hi> do any <hi rend="italic">harm</hi>: and since it would afford a very useful exercise <hi rend="italic">at least</hi>, it would, I am convinced, be a very profitable way of carrying on our correspondence.

J. Bonnycastle (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>). The Dumfries and Galloway <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> was at this time conducting a column which invited contributions of problems in mathematics and their solutions. Thomas Murray in his <hi rend="italic">Autobiographical Notes</hi> (Dumfries, <date when="1911-00-00">1911</date>), pp. 15, 21, writes of Carlyle&#x2019;s interest in mathematics at this time and of his contributions to this column: &#x201C;At College he excelled eminently in mathematics and gained the friendship of Professor Leslie, who quotes his ingenious pupil in a note to his <hi rend="italic">Elements of Mathematics</hi>. Mr Carlyle was, like myself, a frequent contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>.&#x201D; Thanks to the efforts of Mr. Ian M. Campbell of Edinburgh University and of the staff of the Ewart Public Library, Dumfries, the following contributions signed &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle&#x201D; have been found. In the issue of <date when="1814-02-15">15 Feb.</date> a correspondent signing himself &#x201C;N.&#x201D; wrote: &#x201C;I have in my garden four trees, the third stands in a point equi-distant from the two first&#x2014;the fourth in a point equi-distant from the other three&#x2014;and the first is 20 yards distant from the second, and the third 30 yards from the fourth&#x2014; To find the distance of all the trees from each other, and likewise the distance from the trees of a point in the garden, where, if I <hi rend="italic">stand</hi>, I am equi-distant from all the trees?&#x201D; Carlyle&#x2019;s solution, in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> for <date when="1814-02-28">28 Feb.</date>, was in part: &#x201C;Since, however, only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> circle can pass through three points, it is evident that, <hi rend="italic">till the circumference of a circle is made to pass through its centre</hi>, the fourth tree can never be in the circumference of one which passes through the other three; in other words: there can be <hi rend="italic">no</hi> point in the garden equi-distant from all the four. [Paragraph] If Mr N. is determined to be equi-distant from all his trees, he must go to&#x2014;the centre of the earth.&#x201D; Carlyle&#x2019;s witty friend John Edward Hill, who seems to have followed this correspondence very closely, wrote to Carlyle on <date when="1814-02-24">24</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814-02-26">26 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Whom do you intend to take care of the poor fellow&#x2019;s garden, until he return from the destination you appointed him lately&#x2014;the center of the earth?&#x201D; On <date when="1814-03-01">1 March</date> an anonymous contributor, after solving a problem submitted by Walsh and Donald, added the following satirical &#x201C;Remark&#x201D; aimed at Carlyle: &#x201C;Another answer to the same is here given, according to the method of Master Thomas Carlyle, of Edinburgh, (see your last number); viz. the question is capable of being solved by any of the common methods; though to do it &#x2018;we have only to find,&#x2019; by the rule of fluctions, or by the rule of three, or by the rule of <hi rend="italic">Thumb</hi>, the equation necessary, and the thing is done.&#x201D; Carlyle replied to him in the issue <date when="1814-03-08">8 March</date> in a style which at this early date is a remarkable anticipation of the &#x201C;Carlylese&#x201D; of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> and later works: &#x201C;Respecting an extremely <hi rend="italic">acute</hi> &#x2018;remark,&#x2019; which dropt from the pen of the right <hi rend="italic">ingenious</hi>, and (I may add) right <hi rend="italic">Rule-of-Thumb-ic</hi> &#x2018;mathematical&#x2019; solver, to the question in your last, I think it necessary (since your correspondent, with <hi rend="italic">laudable modesty</hi>, declines the honour of <hi rend="italic">fathering</hi> his <foreign><hi rend="italic">jeu d&#x2019;esprit</hi></foreign>, though, haply, the only-begotten of his brain) merely to &#x2018;remark&#x2019;, in my turn, that I did not consider a provincial newspaper the proper vehicle for fluxionary investigations; and that &#x2018;capable,&#x2019; in my solution, was, by mistake, either in printing or transcribing, inserted instead of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">incapable</hi>,&#x2019; as was evident to any person not bounded by conceit, and whose knowledge of his mother tongue amounts to an acquaintance with <hi rend="italic">The Adventures of Thomas Hickathrift</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">The History of Jack the Giant-killer</hi>. [Paragraph] Having thus solved your question, and, &#x2018;lest he&#x2019; might have been &#x2018;wise in his own conceit,&#x2019; answered &#x2018;a fool according to his folly,&#x2019; I beg leave to add, that, should any further <hi rend="italic">anonymous</hi> attempts at wit appear in your paper against me, I shall regard them &#x2018;as the wind that bloweth,&#x2019; and suffer them quietly to &#x2018;fleet back&#x2019; into the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">limbo of vanity</hi>&#x2019; whence they came.&#x2014; I have the honour to be, &#x26;c. / Thomas Carlyle. Edinburgh, <date when="1814-03-04">4th March, 1814</date>.&#x201D; The issue of <date when="1814-03-15">15 March</date> carries what appears to be an editorial &#x201C;Remark&#x201D; following someone&#x2019;s solution to a problem submitted by Walsh and Donald of Dumfries Academy: &#x201C;We are strongly tempted to give another solution of the question by the <hi rend="italic">new method</hi> (not Carlyleian till sanctioned by the public), first communicated to your scientific readers in your No. for the 22d ult.&#x201D; Carlyle himself submits a problem in the same issue: &#x201C;A and B are two ships at sea, distant from each other one mile, A east and B west: A sails east by north, at the rate of 7 knots per hour. At what rate per hour, must B sail in the direction northwest, so that the <hi rend="italic">locus</hi> of their centre of gravity may be a straight line?&#x201D; In the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> for <date when="1814-03-29">29 March</date> Carlyle provided a solution for a problem which had been submitted by &#x201C;W. T.&#x201D; In the same issue the editor printed a note in which he expressed regret for having to suppress Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;severe retaliation&#x201D; for an attack made on him by Messrs. Walsh and Donald. Also in this issue &#x201C;W. T.&#x201D; entered the lists on Carlyle&#x2019;s side: &#x201C;I hoped, after Mr Carlyle&#x2019;s letter in your paper of the 8th current, that the <hi rend="italic">new method</hi>, as I now find it called, of solving mathematical questions, was set at rest, and am sorry to find it revived by the solvers of Messrs W. and D.&#x2019;s question of the 15th inst.&#x201D; See also <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170212-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1817-02-12">12 Feb. 1817</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190223-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1819-02-23">23 Feb. 1819</date></ref>, n.1. The progression of Carlyle&#x2019;s vocational interests was from mathematics and science to the church to law to literature.</note> at this time, where perhaps there may be something <pb id="pg-01-9" n="01:9"/>new to you&#x2014;and again, I stumbled the other night upon a kind of a new demonstration of Pythagoras&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">square of the hypotenuse</hi>; and if you don&#x2019;t find it yourself (most likely you will) I will send you it too.&#x2014; We need be at no loss for subjects, literary, metaphysical mathematical and physical are all before us.&#x2014; I am sure this would be a very good way of spending a part of the summer; and you who are the <hi rend="italic">projector</hi>, will surely never draw back, from what you yourself proposed, and therefore <hi rend="italic">will not fail</hi> to send me your production the <hi rend="italic">very next opportunity</hi>.</p>
<p>Firmly had I resolved, on the faith of your recommendation, to read <hi rend="italic">Thaddeus</hi>,

The truth is, I am acquainted only in one circulating library and there <hi rend="italic">Thaddeus</hi> has always been &#x2018;out.&#x2019;&#x2014; Getting a book from a strange library is a little troublesome, and <supplied>[thus?]</supplied> expecting every day to get it from that where I am known, I made no effort else where. However, I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> have it read, <hi rend="italic">if possible</hi> before I address you again&#x2014;which <pb id="pg-01-10" n="01:10"/>if you stick to promises will not be long.&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;Well, if I am not much deceived you will thank me, for transcribing you the following poem of his, composed on (Wellington, then) Wellesl<supplied>[e]</supplied>y&#x2019;s victory at Assaye, while Leyden was in India.&#x2014; I met with it in &#x2018;the Spy&#x2019;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(Edinburgh, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;11), by James Hogg ( <date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>).</note> a kind of periodical thing published the other year in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>.</p>

<lg><l>Shout, Britons, for the battle of Assaye;</l>
<l>For that was a day,</l>
<l>When we stood in our array,</l>
<l>Like the Lion&#x2019;s might at bay;</l>
<l>And our battle-word was <hi rend="small-caps">Conquer or Die</hi></l></lg>
<lg><l>Rouse, rouse the cruel leopard from his lair,</l>
<l>With his yell the mountain rings;</l>
<l>And his red eye round he flings,</l>
<l>As arrow-like he springs,</l>
<l>And spreads his clutching paw to rend and tear.</l></lg>
<lg><l>Then first array&#x2019;d in battle front we saw,</l>
<l>Far as the eye could glance,</l>
<l>The Mahratta banners dance,</l>
<l>O&#x2019;er the desolate expanse</l>
<l>And their standard was the leopard of Malwa.</l></lg>
<lg><l>But when we first encounter&#x2019;d man to m<supplied>[an]</supplied></l>
<l>Such odds came never on,</l>
<l>Against Greece or Macedon,</l>
<l>When they shook the Persian throne,</l>

<lg><l>Hail, Wellesl<supplied>[e]</supplied>y who led the mortal fray</l>

<l>&#x2019;Mid the dreadful ranks of war,</l>
<l>While the women stood afar,</l>
<l>And gaz&#x2019;d in silent terror at the slain.</l></lg>

<l>Ye who perish&#x2019;d in your prime,</l>
<l>Your hallow&#x2019;d names sublime,</l>
<l>Shall live to ceaseless time;</l>

 <p>On Friday, I heard Dr. Barclay conclude his course, by a lecture on the <hi rend="italic">vital principle</hi> or soul of man. After <hi rend="italic">disproving</hi> a number of wild theories advanced on the subject, he set himself to <hi rend="italic">prove</hi> one of <pb id="pg-01-12" n="01:12"/>the wildest ever hatched in the brain of poor deluded mortal.

<salute>My Dear Murray,</salute>
<p>all is over!&#x2014; But &#x2018;I will tell your honour the whole story just as I got it.&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The account is of Carlyle&#x2019;s interview for the post of mathematics master at Annan Academy, which he held until the end of <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>.</note> Attend, therefore, and before proceeding further, I must beg <pb id="pg-01-13" n="01:13"/>your indulgence for many inaccuracies that must unavoidably occur in this epistle; and I am confident, I would obtain it, if I could take up time in telling you under what circumstances I now write.&#x2014; But this is nothing to the purpose:&#x2014;and&#x2014;&#x2018;to our tale&#x2019;.</p>
<p>You must know, then, that after parting from you on Wednesday-evening, I <hi rend="italic">jogg&#x2019;d on</hi> at a round pace, and arrived at Noble-house<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A farm in the parish of Newlands in Peeblesshire, once a famous inn and posting stage.</note> (jaded enough) about the ninth hour:&#x2014; &#x2018;We have no room here, Sir&#x2019; said the maid &#x2018;the house is full of French prisoners&#x2014;we have just now sent seven of them away&#x2019;;&#x2014;&#x2018;so then I can&#x2019;t stay?&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">eh bien</hi>!</foreign>&#x2019; said I, shrugging up my shoulders&#x2014;and turning my face towards Newland-bridge &#x2018;I know the worst of it&#x2019;. Right wearied, I did arrive at Newland-bridge, a little before ten, and was fortunate enough to procure lodgings sufficiently comfortable. But to detain you no longer with these minutiae&#x2014; I started next morning at five&#x2014;and, sp<supplied>[l]</supplied>ashing and plunging thro&#x2019; wet and mud and mire (for it rained the whole day), I arrived at Moffat about five in the evening&#x2014;procured a seat in the Coach&#x2014;and entered the purlieus of this good town about nine. I found my uncle&#x2019;s house&#x2014;and got every thing as I would have had it.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, I made bold to call upon Mr. White.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas White, rector of Dumfries Academy.</note> Figure to yourself a lank, grim, raw-boned Don-Cossack-looking man of about 6 feet in height and sixty years of age&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">voila M. White</hi>. I told him my story, and was very cordially invited to break-fast, next morning. I went, and found with him Mr. Haig Teacher of English here&#x2014;Mrs and two Misses White:&#x2014;when my name was announced, I could perceive a smile playing upon the countenances of the company&#x2014;however, not a single &#x2018;remark&#x2019; was made upon Donald and Walsh, and consequently our controversy never came upon the tapis.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Donald and Walsh, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18140430-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1814-04-30">30 April</date></ref>.</note> I staied with him till eleven this morning, talking of Mathematics &#x26;c&#x2014;and as far as I could see into him he appears to be a man of great Mathematical knowledge&#x2014;of much reading&#x2014;and deep research. He informed me that he was <hi rend="italic">examiner</hi> of the candidates for Annan&#x2014;that he himself had stood trials and that we might depend upon being tenderly and genteely used.</p>
<p>Well, to come to the crisis.&#x2014; I proceeded, after meeting Mr Dalgliesh, the rector, Mr Waugh, Mr. Hurst &#x26;c (Mr. <hi rend="italic">Footy</hi> [underscored twice] was not there) to the Globe inn, where I was introduced to <hi rend="italic">Francy Thomson</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The other candidate for the position.</note> concerning whom I need not say a word, <pb id="pg-01-14" n="01:14"/>since you know him already. After a great number of professions of candour&#x2014;justice, honour &#x26;c. from all parties the questions, with all due ceremony were produced&#x2014;and to solve them <hi rend="italic">Francy</hi> and I were left with the room to ourselves. Two hours were allowed us; and <hi rend="italic">the Examiner</hi> [underscored twice], called upon us repeatedly to see that all things were rightly understood. Not to detain you with many words&#x2014; White gave in his report in favour of your humble servant, who was in consequence invested in due form, with his office, together with all rights and appurtances thereunto belonging; and had his health drunk (we had already dined) and success wished him by the Directors of the Annan Academy and all the members of the company.&#x2014; This <foreign><hi rend="italic">arduum certamen</hi></foreign> [lofty contest] is thus you see come to a close&#x2014; Thank Heaven for it! say I.&#x2014; I must add, that I enter upon my office <hi rend="italic">on Monday morning</hi>, and consequently that I must leave this to-morrow morning. I can&#x2019;t be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> therefore&#x2014;at this time. Mr. Waugh<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Smith Waugh (<sic><date when="1792-00-00">1792</date></sic> <date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), son of Marion Waugh, shoemaker. He was educated at Annan Academy and Edinburgh University and was for some years mathematics master at Annan Academy prior to TC. He graduated as a doctor, settled in Annan, and died in abject poverty. He published <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on Prophecies of Sacred Scripture which Relate to the Anti-Christian Powers</hi> (<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>) at his own expense and <hi rend="italic">Science of Cerebro-Spinal Phenomena Attempted</hi> (<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>). The Carlyle brothers nicknamed him &#x201C;this child of misfortune.&#x201D; It was probably his father who helped interview Carlyle for the position at Annan.</note> is coming to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I believe in a week&#x2014;to teach; and I will likely consign to him the charge of Messrs. Hay and Biddle<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Students being tutored by Carlyle?</note>&#x2014; together with the charge of another letter to your worship.</p>
<p>You will readily excuse the egotism of this letter, for it is what you desired&#x2014; I therefore make no apology on that head.&#x2014; Neither do I beg your pardon for putting you to the trouble of superintending the conveyance of my trunks; but order you, without scruple, to see them safe off&#x2014;and also to tell <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> and Mrs. For<supplied>[r]</supplied>est<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s landlord and landlady at 3 South Richmond St. Edinburgh.

We got half-drunk about it &#x2026; could I paint to you the feelings and the anxiety that were excited chiefly in the breast (O Glorious Word!) of Miss Merchant I know it would give you pleasure because It would let you know that You have friends&#x2014;real friends in Edinburgh and that the name of Carlyle recalls many a past and happy scene.

I gave in both your letters to the Courier office, on friday&#x2014; I delivered the poet&#x2019;s letter to Preacher;&#x2014;and having met Jeffrey<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly George or Robert Jeffrey, university friends; certainly not Francis.</note> on the street I gave him his also.&#x2014; By the way don&#x2019;t forget to tell Mr Irving, that Preacher complains very much of &#x2018;Fair Helen&#x2019; never yet being come&#x2014;and says he could have sold many a copy, had he had them here.</p>
<p>You will see by the hand writing, as well as the substance of this letter, that at present, <foreign><hi rend="italic">I&#x2019;m nae the thing</hi></foreign> [not quite well]: and as I myself am sensible of that,&#x2014; I will have done immediately. In good truth I have <hi rend="italic">nothing more to say</hi>; but merely that I desire you to give my compliments to Mr. and Mrs Irving&#x2014;to Mr. &#x26; Mrs Forrest&#x2014;and by all manner of means not to forget Miss J. Merchant among the number of my friends. You can ask her (if you like) whether the <hi rend="italic">large stone</hi> of Braid<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle probably refers either to the Buckstane (a piece of freestone about three feet high) in a wall in the Braid Hills area of Edinburgh, a march stone from medieval days taking its name from the fact that the royal buck-hounds were unleashed there, or the Caiy stane, a tall piece of red sandstone a little farther southwest. Obviously this is a private joke. Miss Merchant seems to have been the subject of a mild flirtation for Carlyle and Murray. In his letter of <date when="1814-06-21">21 June</date>, Murray wrote to Carlyle: &#x201C;Miss Merchant when told several days ago that you were gone, felt very keenly. Poor thing! she appears to have a warm and generous heart&#x2014; With all her vanity she possesses many excellent and endearing qualities. &#x2026; She has been repeating great <hi rend="italic">scraps</hi> of Poetry applicable to the occasion, and desired me to remember her to you in the most kind manner, and as we were going home she often said&#x2014;I did not know her motive&#x2014;I never looked upon Mr Carlyle as a <hi rend="italic">sweetheart</hi> but as a very <hi rend="italic">good friend</hi>!&#x2014; Love I replied is only a pure and exalted friendship&#x2014; Well Sir said she &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll grant you!&#x2019; but&#x2014;but&#x2014;I never looked upon Mr. C. as a sweetheart!&#x2014; When you write say something flattering that I may shew it her.&#x201D;</note> is melted away yet&#x2014;and you can <hi rend="italic">tell yourself</hi> if she say no, that there is one <hi rend="italic">boy</hi> [underscored twice] in this planet, that does not care three halfpence about the matter.&#x2014; This is all Greek to you&#x2014;no matter.</p>
<p>My Dear Tom, write me directly&#x2014;and regularly; for as I shall have few or no acquaintance in Annan, the correspondence of a friend will be doubly acceptable. <closer><salute>You shall hear from me soon&#x2014;and I will then be able to enter more into detail&#x2014;at present I have only time to say, that I remain</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Murray,</salute>
<p>I have read over your letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1814-06-21">21 June</date>.</note> many a time, and every time with renewed pleasure. I will not spend time in congratulating you on the ease of your expression, the neatness of your stile, or the <hi rend="italic">versatility</hi> of your remark:&#x2014;your letter pos<supplied>[s]</supplied>esses, in my eyes, a higher excellence&#x2014;it is the letter of a <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> [underscored twice]. Lives there on Earth, a being formed of such unkindly clay, as to wish, oyster-like, to retire within his shell, and crawl thro&#x2019; this world unheeded and unheeding&#x2014;without one heart to sympathize in his disappointment, or rejoice at his success? Alive to the joys of sociality, at least <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am not that being;&#x2014;and when I turn my thoughts on the north, the remembrance of here and there a friend with whom I have been happy&#x2014;nay perhaps the <hi rend="italic">sensation</hi> of some still finer and still stronger attachments!&#x2014;the idea that these friends, too, sometimes think on me&#x2014;altogether&#x2014;sets o&#x2019; vibrating the best and the noblest feelings of the heart.&#x2014; I am got into heroics&#x2014;but the theme inspires heroics&#x2014;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ambivalence was a characteristic of Carlyle and appears early in his development. Well-known instances of it relate to such opposites as Descendentalism and Transcendentalism, Speech and Silence. In this passage he is speaking in glowing terms of the needs of his social nature, a passage which complements passages in which he expresses a romantic, Rousseau-like impulse toward solitude.</note></p>
<p>In return for your pleasing letter, I have nothing to give you but dry and musty details about <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>&#x2014;a subject on which it is always disgusting to expatiate;&#x2014;and which, therefore, I shall dispatch as soon as possible.&#x2014; In three words, then, you are to know, that, after going to Annan on Monday morning, I commenced and still continue my teaching&#x2014;six hours a-day;&#x2014;that (as you expected, not inclining to board in the Academy) I procured a furnished room in the house of a Merchant here&#x2014;for 4/6 <hi rend="italic">per</hi> week;&#x2014;and that I am perfectly comfortable at present;&#x2014;and you know the whole.</p>
<p>Annan is perhaps the finest little town in the south of Scotland. Its situation on the banks both of the Solway and Annan,&#x2014;the fresh&#x2019;ning breezes, with which it is visited from the British channel,&#x2014;the cleanness of its streets, and the neat elegance of its buildings&#x2014;all conspire to render it delightful. Here, too, is an immense <hi rend="italic">shoal</hi> of <hi rend="italic">gentry</hi> [<hi rend="italic">gentry</hi> underscored twice]!&#x2014;nay smile not&#x2014;gentry&#x2014;that is to say, hard-handed <pb id="pg-01-17" n="01:17"/>(aforetime) men of labour&#x2014;venders of Congo tea,&#x2014;and retailers of Jamaica pepper,&#x2014;who thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">cavils</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cabals</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cash-accompts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">treacle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tann-pits</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pits for tanning hides.</note> [<hi rend="italic">treacle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tann-pits</hi> underscored twice], have put themselves in condition to swagger round their little ring of vanity, with all the <hi rend="italic">innate worth</hi> of lucky <hi rend="italic">Save-alls</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mean or ignoble persons.</note> and all the <hi rend="italic">conscious dignity</hi> of <hi rend="italic">purse-proud</hi> Hobnails;&#x2014;who procure for their sons posts in&#x2014;the Excise; and who after <hi rend="italic">educating</hi> their daughters, bring them into the mighty field of Man-catching, and having set them fairly on the scent&#x2014;&#x2018;Cry havoc! and let slip <hi rend="italic">these</hi> dogs of war!&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Julius Caesar</hi>, III, i.</note>&#x2014; To all these I have been introduced, and by them all treated with great <hi rend="italic">condescension</hi>:&#x2014;they and I, &#x2019;tis likely, have very different opinions, concerning <hi rend="italic">who it is that condescends</hi>.&#x2014; Those ladies of the chace!&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;&#x2018;Peace be to all such!&#x2014; <figure><graphic url="volume-01-17-01.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure> mark only&#x2019;&#x2014;I <hi rend="italic">trade</hi> not with them&#x2014;&#x2014; Johnson (Clint) is still continuing his practice or rather <hi rend="italic">attendance</hi> at Lochmaben.

<p>Divinity Johnson has recommenced his school.

He is worthy of a better fortune&#x2014;but what can he do? He is to be examined alongst with Irving Carlyle,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18250304-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1825-03-04">4 March 1825</date></ref>.</note> some of these days, and if found qualified, to be admitted to the <hi rend="italic">privilege</hi> of being a&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">whig Student</hi> [underscored twice]. Depend upon it&#x2014;if they reject <hi rend="italic">him&#x2014;foul play has been shewn</hi>. Their examinations have something in them very <hi rend="italic">original</hi>.&#x2014; Take the following instance. Irving Carlyle (who poor man! full oft has past their ordeal) in <supplied>[one]</supplied> of his examinations (on what branch of literature, the <hi rend="italic">learned Doctors</hi> were the story sayeth not) was asked&#x2014; &#x201C;If a Pot were set on a fire, what is it that would make it boil?&#x201D;&#x2014; Irving was dumb&#x2014; &#x201C;Power would make it boil&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">said the learned Doctors</hi>!!&#x2014;and the <hi rend="italic">examination</hi> [underscored twice] closed.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-18" n="01:18"/>I noticed, with pleasure, the insertion of your
&#x2018;Critique&#x2019;:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray&#x2019;s critique, which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> on <date when="1814-06-21">21 June</date>, dealt favorably with William Nicholson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Tales in Verse and Miscellaneous Poems: Descriptive of Rural Life and Manners</hi> and is signed &#x201C;J. M.&#x201D;</note> but was very much mortified,&#x2014;at seeing the pitiful conclusion which the Editor had foisted in,&#x2014;in addition to the error in the signature. &#x2019;Tis a matter of no consequence&#x2014;only it <hi rend="italic">ruffles</hi> in the mean-time. Our Bard<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The bard, W. Scott Irving, appears to have sent two letters to the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, published on <date when="1814-05-24">24 May</date>, in one of which he refused to subscribe to a monument to Burns and in the other of which he attacked Burns&#x2019;s morals and spoke of the folly of erecting monuments. Both were signed &#x201C;I. M. W.&#x201D; His poem, which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> for <date when="1814-06-21">21 June</date> (dated by him at Edinburgh on <date when="1814-06-10">10 June</date>), was a celebration of peace and the end of the Napoleonic Wars, written on seeing seven thousand prisoners of war being repatriated. In the same issue there is another letter attacking the morals of Burns. Although it is signed &#x201C;A. J. Banks of the Mole, Leatherhead, Surrey, <date when="1814-05-28">May 28 1814</date>,&#x201D; it is probably Scott Irving&#x2019;s also. Blatum Bulgium (as it is now spelled) is at Birrens, a place 2&#xBD; miles from Ecclefechan, from which Carlyle supposes Irving had written. The Romans had had a winter camp there, and some of Carlyle&#x2019;s ancestors are buried there. A letter of <date when="1814-06-28">28 June</date> signed &#x201C;Vindex&#x201D; in the same issue defends Burns and could be Carlyle&#x2019;s. For further information about Irving, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18150621-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1815-06-21">21 June 1815</date></ref>.</note> has at length <hi rend="italic">compelled</hi> them to print his poetry&#x2014;and prose too,&#x2014;for, was not that same <hi rend="italic">Blattum-Bulgium</hi> disquisition his? And had not he a letter last week &#x2018;on Burns&#x2019;?&#x2014; What a flo<supplied>[w]</supplied> of language&#x2014;what a strength of epithet he pos<supplied>[s]</supplied>esses!&#x2014; Do you intend writing any thing more at present?</p>
<p>I have not <hi rend="italic">many</hi> friends in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>.&#x2014;remember me in the kindest manner to those I have. Present (I will not say compliments&#x2014;that is too cold a word) my <hi rend="italic">warmest wishes</hi> to Miss J. Merchant. She is a young lady whose acquaintance I would strongly advise you, assiduously to cultivate.&#x2014; she may have her foibles&#x2014;who of us has them not? But in addition to the external accomplishments of an elegant and beautiful form, she pos<supplied>[s]</supplied>esses a refinement of mind and a sensibility of heart, that <hi rend="italic">must command</hi> respect and esteem wherever they appear.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray replied on <date when="1814-07-27">27 July</date>: &#x201C;I read to Miss Merchant what you said of her. It made her intolerably vain. She was for writing you immediately. I was truly sorry I had shewed her it for her capers disgusted me and if she had wrote, her letter I knew would not have been very acceptable to you.&#x201D; Murray goes on into a rather scathing criticism of her character and regrets the difficulties involved in trying to break with her: &#x201C;I regret very much that I courted her acquaintance so much, for after having had some private walks with a female a person cannot break the connection for some time with any degree of propriety.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Nothing will give me more pleasure, My Dear Murr<supplied>[ay, than]</supplied> to hear from you <hi rend="italic">frequently</hi>. Would it not be better, think y<supplied>[ou, to]</supplied> appoint some <hi rend="italic">time</hi>&#x2014;say once a-fortnight&#x2014;when we should <hi rend="italic">expect</hi> each <pb id="pg-01-19" n="01:19"/>other&#x2019;s letter? Appoint the terms, yourself, of our correspondence&#x2014;only let me be <hi rend="italic">sure of it</hi>. In return for your literary intelligence which will be peculiarly interesting to me, I&#x2019;m afraid I shall have no equivalent to offer.&#x2014; However I shall always take care to repay you with <hi rend="italic"> something</hi>&#x2014; I did not send you a letter by Mr. Waugh<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray had written on <date when="1814-06-21">21 June</date>: &#x201C;I shall be very glad that you write me by M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Waugh because to hear from you is always pleasant and because I should like to be acquainted with your friend.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;first, because I thought you would not like him; and second, because&#x2014;I had none <hi rend="italic">to</hi> send.&#x2014; &#x2018;But you will attend&#x2019;!&#x2014; A carrier (he brought my trunks safe) is to set off for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> about monday and will be with you by Thursday, or so&#x2014; Now if I can by any means, write <hi rend="italic">another</hi> epistle to you, &#x2018;by the sure conveyance of&#x2019; this same &#x2018;honest carrier&#x2019;, I shall certainly look for your answer.&#x2014; Tell our Poet, that by <hi rend="italic">Hook or crook</hi>, I&#x2019;ll see to have a letter for him by the same opportunity&#x2014;and let him have one ready in return. Tell Mr. Forrest to be in the way of getting his <hi rend="italic">poem</hi> ready&#x2014;for a letter he shall have&#x2014;and a swinging one too&#x2014;so let him look to it.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray had also written in his letter of <date when="1814-06-21">21 June</date>: &#x201C;Mr For<supplied>[r]</supplied>est often recollects the days that are past<supplied>[;]</supplied> he would be glad to hear from you and would give you in return a funny letter or perhaps a Poem. &#x2026; If you would write For<supplied>[r]</supplied>est it would make him very proud.

For this purpose having been obliged to be at Mount-Annan every morning, by seven o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;to teach so much later in the evening, at the Academy&#x2014;to prepare Xenophon&#x2019;s Greek;&#x2014;together with the innumerable little nameless <hi rend="italic">items</hi> that hourly call the attention&#x2014;you will readily believe that I have had little or no time to spare. The truth is&#x2014;&#x2019;till last Wednesday (when our vacation commenced and I came here to reside altogether) I have scarcely had time to breathe;&#x2014;and I assure you, this is the first letter I have written since you heard from me last.&#x2014; Having thus anticipated and prevented all murmurs, reflections and complaints of what kind, nature or form soever;&#x2014;I proceed to business.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Were it not that I make a point of <hi rend="italic">avoiding every appearance of flattery</hi>, I could say much respecting the stile and manner of your last letter; but to carry on a correspondence by passing encomiums on each others talents, would as you justly observe be altogether useless and even hurtful.

<p>&#x2014;But&#x2014;O Tom! what a foolish flattering creature tho<supplied>[u]</supplied> art! to talk of future eminence, and connection with the literary history of the Nineteenth century to such a one as me!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray had also written in his letter of <date when="1814-07-27">27 July</date>: &#x201C;The time I hope will come&#x2014;but I trust is far distant&#x2014;when these our juvenile epistles will be read&#x2014; &#x26; probably applauded&#x2014;by a generation unborn and that the name of <hi rend="italic">Carlyle at least</hi> will be inseparably connected with the literary history of the nineteenth century.

<p>I was greatly diverted by your specimen of Mr. Maclaurin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">prose-run-mad</hi>.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maclaurin seems to have been the too eloquent secretary of a debating society at the university.

<p>I perfectly agree with you in your remarks on Miss Merchant: and if you repented of having shewn her my <hi rend="italic">mock eulogy</hi>; well may I repent of having written it. I have been <hi rend="italic">favoured</hi> with an epistle from her.&#x2014;and such an epistle!&#x2014; But if you desire it, you shall have a copy, <foreign><hi rend="italic">verbatim et literatim</hi></foreign> [true to each word and letter-perfect], in my next:&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I can&#x2019;t positively say, that it is <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> the reading:&#x2014;for, really, in <hi rend="italic">shallowness, affectation</hi> and <hi rend="italic">kakography</hi> [underscored twice] &#x2018;it passeth&#x2019;.&#x2014; I had no idea that she was such a miserable scribe.&#x2014; The more I know her and her <hi rend="italic">species</hi> the more heartily I despise them.&#x2014; It is strang<supplied>[e,]</supplied> but it is true, that by a continuing and unvaried exercise of <hi rend="italic">affectation</hi>, those creatures in the end entirely lose any kind of real feeling which they <hi rend="italic">might</hi> originally have pos<supplied>[s]</supplied>essed.

Never&#x2014; But I have already wasted too much time on her and those like her.&#x2014; Heaven be their Comforter!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps Murray and Carlyle were a little cruel to the unfortunate Miss Merchant, a young lady whom they could not quite treat with complete indifference. When Murray replied to Carlyle on <date when="1814-09-09">9 Sept.</date>, he said, &#x201C;In the name of Curiosity send me Miss Merchant&#x2019;s Letter&#x2014; Don&#x2019;t occupy your sheet by copying it. It will come by the carrier and I shall return it to you safe and sound.&#x201D; On <date when="1814-12-09">9 Dec.</date> Murray again urged Carlyle to send the letter: &#x201C;Mind Miss M&#x2019;s Letter.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Poet Nicholson,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1814-07-27">27 July</date> Murray had written to Carlyle: &#x201C;I told Mr Nicholson where you are stationed and to call upon you <foreign><hi rend="italic">en passant</hi></foreign>&#x2014;he is to be in Edin. about the beginning of <date when="1814-09-00">september</date>.

<p>A-propos of Authors&#x2014; This evening at tea, Miss Ramsay (our governess) inquired at me if I had read that affecting representation of the Calamities of Literary men, in the last <hi rend="italic">Courier;</hi>&#x2014;replying in the negative, she handed me the paper:&#x2014;and judge of my surprise when, looking at the bottom, I recognised the signature of Mr. Murray&#x2014; You will readily conceive, I read it with additional interest on this account&#x2014;but allow me to remark (and this is all the <hi rend="italic">Critique</hi> I design to pass on it) that it needed no such adventitious circumstance to recommend it. The melancholy truth which it contains, and the elegant sympathysing manner in which it is told, speak for themselves.&#x2014; In sober sadness, now, did you really see that same melancholy old author, at Merchiston?&#x2014;or is he not a creature of Mr. Murray&#x2019;s brain?

He is a writer who has failed, who has lost his wife and family, and who by reason of genius is unfit to deal with the problems of ordinary life. He is lost in raptures at the beauty of the castle. He is compared to Savage, Derrick, and Heron, whose fates are given in a footnote: the first a dramatist and poet who died in jail, the second an Irish poet who died in poverty, and the third a Galloway historian of Scotland who died in Newgate after being imprisoned for debt.

 <p>I have seen the last number of the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> review at Mount-annan.

<salute>My Dear Mitchell,</salute>
<p>When I look at the date of your last, elegant and endearing letter, I feel a throb of something approaching to <hi rend="italic">remorse</hi> for the suspicion of ingratitude and inconstancy which you (if you thought of me at all) must have entertained of me, for my apparently unaccountable neglect of a correspondence which I had been the first to sollicit, and the most eager to cultivate.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There are two letters from Mitchell which Carlyle may have in mind. One is that of <date when="1814-05-30">30 May</date>, and the other, dated only &#x201C;Friday night,&#x201D; contains the geometry problems described (MS: NLS, 1764.37). Mitchell did not receive this letter from Carlyle for a long time (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18141024-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, 
<date when="1824-10-24">24 Oct.</date></ref>). It has a postmark of <date when="1815-01-07">Jan. 7, 1815</date>, on it. Judging by internal references in later letters, he received it sometime between <date when="1815-02-14">14 Feb.</date> and <date when="1815-03-16">16 March</date>.</note> I hope, however, that when you shall have heard &#x2018;the story of my woes&#x2019;&#x2014;that is, my history for the last four months, you will be ready to grant me your forgivenness, and to recieve me once more into your good graces.&#x2014;</p>

<p>In seriousness, your Mathematical investigations are excellent.

I went next morning to brea<supplied>[k]</supplied>fast with Mr. White&#x2014;and in the course of our conversation, happening to mention the trisection of an angle, &#x2018;I have in my pocket&#x2019; said I &#x2018;the result of an ingenious young friend and fellow student&#x2019;s attempts on that subject&#x2014;&#x2019;Tis here.&#x2019; <pb id="pg-01-28" n="01:28"/>Mr. W. had no sooner cast his eye upon your diagram than, starting up and uttering a wildly-accented &#x2018;aye!!&#x2019; he left the room.&#x2014; He soon dissipated the mistery by returning with an armful of dun aged manuscripts, he desired me to look at one of them and I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> surprised to see <hi rend="italic">the same property</hi>. He complained bitterly that <hi rend="italic">Mr. Leslie had shewed it you</hi> and never mentioned <hi rend="italic">his</hi> [underscored twice] name!

<p>By the way, could not we, think you, contrive to continue this mode of interchanging our lucubrations?&#x2019; Tis a project, I like vastly, and from which I had promised myself much instru<supplied>[c]</supplied>tion as well as entertainment.

Give me your opinion of it if you have read it;&#x2014;and if not&#x2014;endeavour by all means to procure it.<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Waverley</hi> was published in <date when="1814-07-00">July 1814</date>. Ebenezer Cruickshanks was landlord of the Seven-Branched Golden Candlestick where Waverley stopped. &#x201C;Mine host of the garter&#x201D; is an allusion to <hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi> and is mentioned by Scott in a note on Scottish inns, which, however, has no reference to Ebenezer Cruickshanks. The Rev. Mr. Goukthrapple is a minor character, a Covenanting clergyman. Baron Bradwardine is an eccentric old Jacobite nobleman who plays a major role in the novel. Callum Beg is page to Fergus MacIvor. Carlyle calls Beg &#x201C;apathic&#x201D; (without sensation), but &#x201C;amoral&#x201D; would be a better word for him. Vich Ian Vohr is Fergus MacIvor, &#x201C;son of John the Great,&#x201D; a Highland chieftain and Jacobite leader.</note></p>

Conway, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>. Conway dates the letter <date when="1815-12-05">5 Dec. 1815</date>. It is obviously written in reply to Murray&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1814-09-09">9 Sept. 1814</date> in which he discusses reading Scott&#x2019;s

<p>&#x2026; I had a sight of &#x201C;Waverley&#x201D; soon after I received your letter, and I cannot help saying that, in my opinion, it is by far the best novel that has been written these thirty years&#x2014;at least, that I know of. Eben. Cruickshanks, mine host of The Seven Golden Candlesticks, and Mr. Gifted Gilfillan, are described in the spirit of Smollett or Cervantes. Who does not shed a tear for the ardent Vich Ian Vohr, and the unshaken Evan Dhu, when perishing amid the shouts of an English mob, they refuse to swerve from their principles? And who will refuse to pity the marble Callum Beg, when, hushed in the strife of death, he finishes his earthly career on Clifton Moor, far from the blue mountains of the North, without one friend to close his eyes? &#x2019;Tis an admirable performance. Is Scott still the reputed author?</p>

<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray had written at some length about Lewis, the weakness of his poems, and his tendency to drink too much, in his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1815-01-24">24 Jan.</date> Lewis, the author of <hi rend="italic">Fair Helen of Kirkconnel</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>) and <hi rend="italic">The African Slave</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>), had called on Murray in Edinburgh, shown him a prospectus for a new volume of verse, and asked him to write to Carlyle about it in hope that Carlyle would help him to get subscribers in Annandale and Dumfriesshire. Lewis was perhaps the first of many living poets to whom Carlyle, perhaps too well known for his general attack on the poetry of his day, extended a helping hand.</note> Th<supplied>[is]</supplied> I found to be a task of some difficulty; there being but few, in the country&#x2014;and those mostly in the pos<supplied>[s]</supplied>ession of people, with whom I had no dealings.&#x2014; I heard at length of a copy, in the hand<supplied>[s]</supplied> of a certain ancient personage (<hi rend="italic">Jamie White the Cooper</hi>); and from him, I was lucky enough to obtain it. It is imperfect, but I believe wants only two pages at each end&#x2014;and at any rate it <supplied>[is]</supplied> the best, indeed only one, I could get hold of.</p>
<p>Upon reperusing the volume, I feel more and more confident, that it contains poems, which if properly selected and given to the world along with the other productions of its Author, would secure him both honour and emoluments:&#x2014;I am not going to enter into any <pb id="pg-01-38" n="01:38"/>critical detail of their merits; but I cannot help <supplied>[ob]</supplied>serving, that had Lewis never written any thing else, than <supplied>[the]</supplied> &#x2018;verses on the death of an only son&#x2019;&#x2014;and the song &#x2018;Wandering Ma<supplied>[ry&#x2019;&#x2014;]</supplied> his title to the name of <hi rend="italic">poet</hi> would have been undisputed. The volume indeed abounds with a strain of <hi rend="italic">original</hi> thought and fee<supplied>[ling]</supplied> which is not always to be met with in books of the kind. <supplied>[And]</supplied> for the want of which, a thousand <hi rend="italic">ban-dogs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dun-</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">de</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">er</hi> and <hi rend="italic">donjon-keeps</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ladyes fair</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably words from various poems by Scott and other romantic writers.</note> can never compensate.</p>
<p>You will readily believe, I received with great pleasu<supplied>[re]</supplied> the intelligence your letter gave me, of the speedy publication of these poems, in which I have expressed so much interest<supplied>[.]</supplied> Lewis is a man whose misfortunes I pity, and whose genius I admire&#x2014;and he may rely upon all the little influence I po<supplied>[ss]</supplied>ess, being exerted in his favour. Tell him to send me, along with your letter (and the <hi rend="italic">sooner</hi>, the better) half-a-dozen of his <hi rend="italic">prospectus</hi>; and I entertain little dowbt of being able to give a good account of them&#x2014;at least, the contrary shall not happe<supplied>[n]</supplied> for want of assiduity on my part&#x2014; I have only one othe<supplied>[r]</supplied> observation to make on the subject&#x2014;and it is&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">price</hi> you mention is one half too little&#x2014;no person that would be at the pains to give half-a-crown for Lewis&#x2019; poems&#x2014;that would not also give four or five shillings with equal cheerfulness&#x2014;nay with more&#x2014;for 2/6 has such a pitiful sound&#x2014;and conveys such a diminutive idea with it. But those who conduct the publication&#x2014;have
been influenced, no doubt, by reasons, to which I am a stranger.</p>

<p>It is a considerable time since I saw Leslie&#x2019;s review of La Place&#x2019;<supplied>[s]</supplied> essay on chances<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A review of Laplace&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Essai philosophique sur les probabilit&#xE9;s</hi> appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> for 
 <date when="1814-09-00">Sept. 1814</date>. This, however, has been attributed to Playfair rather than Leslie. Murray had discussed it at length in his letter.</note>&#x2014;and remarked with considerable surprise&#x2014;the bold avowall of his sentiments on Hume&#x2019;s doctrine&#x2014; &#x2018;The Christian Instructor&#x2019; attacks him with considerable asperity&#x2014;and, I think, success. Hume&#x2019;s essays, I have not read&#x2014;and therefore cannot condemn&#x2014; The evidence of testimony, too, no doubt has its limits&#x2014; But as far as I can judge, all that is urged either by La Place or His reviewer&#x2014;does not at all affect <hi rend="italic">Christianity</hi>. Supposing even the extreme case, which he adduces, of the sun&#x2019;s being visible at London during the whole twenty four hours&#x2014;were all the individuals who might be supposed capable of seeing the phenomenon, to agree in giving their testimony to the fact&#x2014;nay more&#x2014;were they willingly for its sake to submit to hardships, privation and <hi rend="italic">death</hi> rather than deny it; who is there that would not credit their assertion? Christianity is supported by evidence as strong as this&#x2014;and the facts on which it is founded are confirmed by a testimony sealed in blood&#x2014;a testimony to which none but a man bigotted to scepticism will refuse to assent.</p>

<salute>My Dear Bob,</salute>
<p>At sundry times and in divers ways, I have pondered upon a project I had formed&#x2014;of sending you a letter to arouse you, if possible, from the state of torpor in which, of late, to my unspeakable regret your faculties were benumbed.&#x2014; You are obliged to me for my intentions&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; tribulations of various sorts have prevented me from putting them in execution, you are not the less obliged on that account.&#x2014; You are a happy fellow, Mit, to be allowed to sit under your vine and under your fig-tree, quietly ruminating on your thirty-nine articles, with none to make you afraid.&#x2014;and how could you be so cruel as to mention, those heart-breaking discourses?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >These are their theological exercises for the university. Mitchell wrote Carlyle on <date when="1815-02-14">14 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;And then our Discourses you know&#x2014; I have shunned them like monsters but the longer one keeps them off the more difficult they appear to be&#x2014; This is only by the way&#x2014;for&#x2014;since they are not begun&#x2014;I may very likely be repeating the same sage determination this day 6 Months.&#x201D;</note> How, or when or wherewithal are they to be made?&#x2014; In sobriety, that <hi rend="italic">putting off</hi>, and that <hi rend="italic">dissipation of</hi> <supplied>[<hi rend="italic">stud</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">ies</hi> is a serious evil. A thousand times have I lamented that hop-skip-and-jump disposition of mine, which is perpetually prompting me to fly off at a tangent from whatever I am engaged in. Your &#x2018;auricular confession&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell had written: &#x201C;I am such a wavering volatile animal that no sooner you think you have a firm hold of me in one department than I dart to another and from that to a third&#x2014; Born to be the slave of every wayward humour it is impossible I can reach perfection in any one department&#x2014; Jack of all trades and master of none. This is a defect and a great one&#x2014;but I almost despair of remedy.&#x201D;</note> owns the same propensity: and I begin to think it is a fault of <hi rend="italic">every</hi> mind&#x2014;which effort alone can cure. I could be <hi rend="italic">metaphysical</hi> perhaps; but you will be better satisfied with an example:&#x2014; It was but yesternight, that I your most obed<hi rend="italic">t</hi> serv<hi rend="italic">t</hi> became all at once sensible of the <hi rend="italic">importance of present time</hi>, and having brought out my <hi rend="italic">accoutrements</hi>, set right doughtily <pb id="pg-01-42" n="01:42"/>to the composition of my <hi rend="italic">exegesis</hi>. I began with alacrity of soul; and had finished the fourth line when I made a&#x2014;dead halt!&#x2014; One cannot long be idle&#x2014;you will not wonder that I took up the first book that came in my way&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; it was the dullest of all dull books, yet by a fatality attendant on those things, I could not give it up. It purported to be a &#x2018;history of a lover&#x2019;&#x2014;showing how Cecilia<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This is not Fanny Burney&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Cecilia</hi>. Neither is it a &#x201C;society novel&#x201D; by Maria Edgeworth, but it is probably something by one of her imitators.</note> (somebody) being poor but honest went to Paris, with some Brandy Irish Dowager (of Tipperary) and was much astounded at their goings on&#x2014;yet very much liked by the beaux. Shewing how after divers trials and temptations she married with a lord (something) who had been a very great rascal in his early days but was now become a most delectable personage; how the<supplied>[y]</supplied> lived in great harmony of souls till the honest man one day riding on som<supplied>[e]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">wold</hi> and happening to fall from his beast in the presence of this notable lady, she fell into hystericks or convulsions and was taken home in a wo<supplied>[e]</supplied>ful plight&#x2014;where she loitered on till she was &#x2018;brought to bed,&#x2019; when she took her leave of the goodman and all the world&#x2014; Would you believe me, I read &#x26; read this horrid story &#x26; might have been reading yet had not a most dolorous ode to Matrimonial&#x2014;no &#x2018;Monody on the Death of a beloved&#x2019; &#x26;c compelled me to throw past the book; and set to writing you a letter. Tell <hi rend="italic">me</hi> not again of &#x2018;Jacks of all Trades&#x2019;&#x2014;you are a king of a student compared with me.</p>
<p>You are charitable enough to suppose that my head is full of ideas&#x2014;your good nature misleads you.&#x2014; I have indeed had ideas and strange ones too since I wrote you; but like many other remarkable ideas, they have had the fortune to evaporate as soon as produced. Mathematics, I have absolutely never thought on&#x2014;excepting some trifles from the Ladies&#x2019; and Gentleman&#x2019;s diary<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Reuben Burrow, published <date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1779-00-00">79</date>.</note>&#x2014;which I shall have conscience enough not to trouble you with at present. Great and manifold are the books I have read since I saw you. You recommended Thaddeus of Warsaw<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This novel by Jane Porter (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>) was published in <date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>.</note> long ago you may remember&#x2014;and the work in my judgement fully deserves it. Miss Porter has no wit&#x2014;she invariably bungles a picture of the conversatio<supplied>[n]</supplied> of ordinary persons, whenever she attempts it&#x2014;why does she delight in unfolding the forward weaknesses of the <hi rend="italic">female</hi> heart, and making even Mary Beaufort love first?&#x2014; Yet with all her deficiencies she is interesting; &#x2014;never failing <pb id="pg-01-43" n="01:43"/>to excite our sympathy, tho she cannot rank with our Fielding or Smollett&#x2014;she infinitely surpasses the insipid froth of</p>

<p>As an extraordinary instance of perseverance, I must mention my having read &#x2018;Cicero de
officiis.&#x2019;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >These are essays on old age, friendship, duty, etc., <date>44 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date></note> You must read it too Bob&#x2014; You will get thro&#x2019; it in a week&#x2014;and cannot think your time mis<supplied>[s]</supplied>pent.

<p>But the most extraordinary production of any, I have seen these many days, is &#x2018;La Pucelle d&#x2019;Orleans&#x2019;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published in <date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>.</note> an Epic by Voltaire. This Mock-Heroic illustrates several things&#x2014; First that the French held Voltaire a sort of demigod&#x2014;secondly (and consequently) that they were wrong in so doing&#x2014;and thirdly that the said Voltaire is the most impudent, blaspheming, libidinous blackgaurd that ever lived. As proofs of the first take the following specimen of French ingenuousness, from the preface by the Editor&#x2014; After affirming that the poem is Voltaire&#x2019;s&#x2014; he observes that&#x2014;&#x2018;<foreign>Personne na &#xE9;t&#xE9; la dupe du desaveu qu&#x2019;il a fait de ce po&#xEB;me, dans un lettre &#xE0; Messieurs de l&#x2019;Academie Francaise.

His truthfulness has long been known. Everyone knows that to affirm or deny according to time, place, and decorum was always one of his favorite maxims, and in truth a man so extraordinary must indeed have principles which suit him.&#x201D;</note> Happy great man! Peace be to him and his &#x2018;<foreign>principes qui lui soient propres</foreign>&#x2019;!&#x2014; An epigrammatist&#x2014;sagely remarks&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am glad you saw Lara; and am indebted for your account of it. I read the review of it in the Quarterly review&#x2014;some time ago. Lara, it seems is the identical Conrad, and Kaleb, no other than that same &#x2018;dark-eyed slave,&#x2019; Gulnare, of whom such frequent mention is made in &#x2018;the Corsair.&#x2019; The story appears to want <foreign><hi rend="italic">ecla<supplied>[i]</supplied>recissement</hi></foreign> [clarifying]. What could become of the mad-cap knight? And what was the meaning of that carcase in the river?

<p>I am highly indebted to you for Hume.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Hume (<date when="1711-00-00">1711</date>&#x2013;<date when="1776-00-00">76</date>), <hi rend="italic">Essays Moral, Political and Literary</hi> (<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>&#x2013;<date when="1748-00-00">48</date>). In the edition of <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date> (<hi rend="italic">The Philosophical Works of David Hume</hi>, Vol. III) they are numbered thus: Pt. 1: 10, &#x201C;Of Superstition and Enthusiasm&#x201D;; 11, &#x201C;Of the Dignity or Meanness of Human Nature&#x201D;; 15, &#x201C;The Epicurean&#x201D;; 16, &#x201C;The Stoic&#x201D;; 17, &#x201C;The Platonist&#x201D;; and 18, &#x201C;The Sceptic.&#x201D; Carlyle&#x2019;s remarks about national character are derived from the essay &#x201C;Of National Characters,&#x201D; No. 21; and his comments on David Hume making love were suggested by &#x201C;The Epicurean.&#x201D;</note> I like his essays better <pb id="pg-01-48" n="01:48"/>than any thing I have read these many days. He has prejudices, he does maintain errors&#x2014;but he defends his positions, with so much ingenuity, that one would be almost sorry to see him dislodged. His Essays on &#x2018;Superstition &#x26; Enthusiasm,&#x2019; on &#x2018;the Dignity &#x26; meanness of Human Nature&#x2019; and several others, are in my opinion admirable both in matter &#x26; manner:&#x2014;particularly the first where his conclusions might be verified by instances, with which we are all acquainted. The manner, indeed, of all is excellent:&#x2014;the highest &#x26; most difficult effect of art&#x2014;the appearance of its absence&#x2014;appears throughout. But many of his opinions are not to be adopted&#x2014; How odd does it look for instance to refer <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the modifications of &#x2018;National character,&#x2019; to the influence of moral causes. Might it not be asserted with some plausibility, that even those which he denominates moral causes, originate from physical circumstances? Whence but from the perpetual contemplation of his dreary glaciers &#x26; rugged glens&#x2014;from his dismal broodings in his long &#x26; almost solitary nights, has the Scandinavian conceived his ferocious Odin, &#x26; his horrid &#x2018;spectres of the deep&#x2019;? Compare this with the copper-castles and celestial gardens of the Arabian&#x2014;and we must admit that physical causes <hi rend="italic">have</hi> an influence on man. I read &#x2018;the Epicurean,&#x2019; &#x2018;the Stoic,&#x2019; &#x2018;the Platonist&#x2019; &#x26; &#x2018;the Sceptic&#x2019; under some disadvantage. They are perhaps rather clumsily executed&#x2014;and the idea of David Hume declaiming, nay of David Hum<supplied>[e]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">making love</hi> appears not less grotesque than would that of ad &#x2026; -oc [covered by seal: <supplied>d]</supplied>ancing a French cotillon.

I had heard a sort of vague account that you were sick; and I had formed the project of coming up to condole with you, when (it seems) you had so much need of condolence&#x2014;buffetted as you have been by &#x2018;ennui, torpor and hepatitis.&#x2019; It made me happy to learn, that you had come to a &#x2018;quietus&#x2019;: and the only remark I shall make on the subject is&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">be thankful</hi>&#x2014;that such moderate allowances of &#x2018;Leech&#x2019;s bolus&#x2019; were able to produce the effect&#x2014;for there are froward creatures in the world, to make whose &#x2018;quietus&#x2019; defies the power of any thing less efficacious than&#x2014;&#x2018;a bare bodkin.&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is replying to Mitchell&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1815-05-31">31 May</date> and also to Mitchell&#x2019;s illhumored letter of Tuesday, <date when="1815-05-30">30 May</date>, which, curiously enough, seems to have been sent after all and is still extant. Mitchell had written: &#x201C;Buffeted, vexed, and tormented with ennui, torpor, <hi rend="italic">hepatitis</hi>, blisters and quicksilver, I set myself down to vent my splenetic humours against you, &#x2026; since that, the efforts of Leech&#x2019;s bolus and pill have reduced my body and mind to a state of quietus.&#x201D; For Carlyle&#x2019;s echoing of &#x201C;quietus&#x201D; and addition of &#x201C;a bare bodkin,&#x201D; see <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, i.</note></p>
<p>You take it upon you to scold<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There is no scolding of Carlyle in Mitchell&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1815-05-31">31 May</date>.</note> me for not calling as I went to Dumfries. But hear my story Mit&#x2014; I was proceeding quietly from Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to Annan, without the smallest intention of going on any such expedition, when I met with Johnson,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is difficult to determine what Johnson, or perhaps Johnston, is indicated.</note> and he advised me to accompany him. We were obliged to use all possible dispatch for fear of being too late; and (before we got Jeffrey<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably, George Jeffrey.</note> accoutred at Flush,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A home or farmhouse near Ruthwell.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c) it being about <pb id="pg-01-50" n="01:50"/>eleven o&#x2019;clock, I had absolutely no time to see you, tho&#x2019; I certainly intended it when I left Annan.&#x2014; Indeed I did see from the road, a tall lank figure performing its gyrations round Ruthwell Church with much solemnity:&#x2014;but whether it was Mitchell, I know not.&#x2014; It was near two when we got to Dumfries&#x2014;and being consequently prevented from getting within half a league of St. Micheals&#x2014;we saw the ceremony of laying the stone, exactly as well as if we had been in the grand square of Tombuctoo. Yet notwithstanding this&#x2014;notwithstanding that all the scullions in Dumfries-shire were &#x2018;let slip&#x2019;&#x2014;notwithstanding the cantering and parading of the Etterick Yeomen&#x2014;notwithstanding the paper-caps, the figured rouquelaures, the magic-lanthorns of free masonry&#x2014;it was a striking scene.&#x2014; Scotland paying the tribute of well earned honour to one of the noblest of her sons.&#x2014; It is a great pity that the monument will not be over his grave:&#x2014;many inconveniences ought to have been submitted to in order to gain this point.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The foundation stone of the Burns Mausoleum at Dumfries, to be over his grave.

<p>I could not send you the review&#x2014;for the man of whom I had borrowed it, had got it again, &#x26; lent it to another. If I can get it again, at any time, I will send it you.

Nevertheless I like it. Akenside was an enthusiastic admirer of the ancient republics and of the ancient philosophers&#x2014; He thought highly of Lord Shaftesbury&#x2019;s principles &#x26; had a bad opinion of Scotsmen. For this last peculiarity, <pb id="pg-01-51" n="01:51"/>he has been severely caricatured by Smollet<supplied>[t]</supplied> in his Peregrine Pickle&#x2014;under the character of the fantastic English Doctor in Franc<supplied>[e]</supplied><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tobias Smollett (<date when="1721-00-00">1721</date>&#x2013;<date when="1771-00-00">71</date>), Scottish novelist and author of <hi rend="italic">Peregrine Pickle</hi> (<date when="1751-00-00">1751</date>), in which the hero is accompanied in France by the artist Pallet and the fantastic English doctor.

Pride will often overturn what reason had attempted in vain&#x2014;&#x26; when the carrion and offal of human nature begin to adopt the tenets of our sages&#x2014;we look for something new. What leads me to say this is that I have heard lately that there are in Middlebie sundry cunning workmen&#x2014;some skilled in the intricacies of the loom&#x2014;some acquainted with the operations of the lapstone&#x2014;who are <hi rend="italic">notable deists</hi>&#x2014;nay several aspire to taste the sublime delights of <hi rend="italic">Atheism</hi>!

<salute>My Dear Murray</salute>
<p>I am, without doubt, the most careless, graceless, ungrateful <hi rend="italic">never-do-well</hi>, in being.&#x2014; These three months have your letters<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1815-03-25">25 March</date>; <date when="1815-04-04">4 April</date>; <date when="1815-04-10">10 April</date>.</note> lain in my drawer, daily demanding an answer, &#x26; daily answered with a &#x2018;call again tomorrow.&#x2019; I entreat you, pardon me&#x2014;I could not help it&#x2014;it is the nature of man.&#x2014; During the first month, I firmly expected to see you in Annan as you went to Galloway&#x2014;(why was I disappointed?) and consequently did not answer your letters directly.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray replied to Carlyle on <date when="1815-06-29">29 June</date>: &#x201C;I was sorry I could not visit you at Annan. I had to come to Galloway <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Minyhive where I have a Sister whom I had not seen for some time&#x2014;and where I know a Sister of Mr Grierson married to Mr Barber of Tirerran&#x2014;and after I arrived in Galloway I could not get away.&#x201D;</note> And when this expectation had left me, I was seized with a certain, perverse, torpid, monotonous mental palsy&#x2014;that incapacitates for every thing. The weather was bad&#x2014;I was baffled in my hopes of seeing you&#x2014;pestered by melancholies, ph<supplied>[l]</supplied>egm, coughs and catarrhs&#x2014;behold all these things were against me&#x2014;and in such an humour, I could as easily have found out the longitude as written you a word of sense. Such is my excuse&#x2014;I know it will not pass, and I throw myself on <pb id="pg-01-53" n="01:53"/>your clemency&#x2014;punish me as you please&#x2014;only do not use me <supplied>[in the]</supplied> same way.</p>
<p>By this time you are got acquainted with your situation, and I <supplied>[hope]</supplied> you are comfortable in it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray had gone as tutor to a family in Wigtown. He wrote on <date when="1815-03-25">25 March</date>: &#x201C;I &#x2026; <hi rend="italic">go to a family in Wigto<supplied>[w]</supplied>nshire</hi> &#x2026; The family (M<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Twaddall of Caldon) is very respectable and rather wealthy.&#x201D; He was to be paid &#xa3;40 or 50 with traveling expenses and a month&#x2019;s leave to go to the university in the winter (for his divinity work). He wrote, <date when="1815-06-29">29 June</date>, saying that the family was pleasant but that the children (he taught six, out of a family of ten) were in need of discipline.</note>&#x2014; The most disagre<supplied>[e]</supplied>able circumstance, in a Tutor&#x2019;s life, is his want of society. There is no person, in the family, of equal rank with him, except the Governess; and as the aims &#x26; ends of her &#x26; him are often various, and their dispositions heterogeneous&#x2014;the Tutor is for most part left to <hi rend="italic">commune with himself</hi>. Such a situation in this view is not desirable&#x2014;but the power of habit is unlimited&#x2014;and at any rate this state has its advantages: the increase of opportunities it affords for study, is obvious; and tho&#x2019; we cannot enjoy the spirit-stirring <foreign><hi rend="italic">crack</hi></foreign> [talk] of our jocund cronies&#x2014;yet if we can spend the same time, with Shakespeare or Addison or Stewart, we are gainers by the privation. I grant, we cannot <hi rend="italic">always</hi> live with your sages &#x26; your demigods&#x2014;but no conversati<supplied>[on]</supplied> at all is preferable to the gossipping and tittle-tattle, that many a poor wight is forced to brook&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> your humble servant&#x2014;living like &#x2018;Pelican in wilderness&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>Mrs Lewis<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wife of the poet Stewart Lewis. Lewis sent Carlyle a letter with his wife, <date when="1815-04-10">10 April</date>, asking for help in obtaining sales of his poems.</note> came upon the people of Annandale, quite unexpectedly. She appeared to be in low spirits, and tho&#x2019; I exerted myself to the utmost, I could make but a sorry account of the transaction. I had looked long and earnestly for a <hi rend="italic">prospectus</hi>, and as none came, I had no subsrcibers. Some, to whom I offered the book, &#x2018;had seen it twenty years ago&#x2019;&#x2014;others (ungenerous triumph of frigid apathy!) told me that Stewart was a drunkard&#x2014;and others observed that they would with pleasure treat Stewart himself with a <foreign><hi rend="italic">half mutchkin or twae</hi></foreign> if they saw him, but for the poems they <hi rend="italic">had <foreign>nae</foreign> change</hi>! With the assistance of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Jeffrey (brother to the Preacher)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Annandale Jeffreys, not to be confused with the family of Francis Jeffrey in Edinburgh.</note> I aided Mrs. L. in getting off <pb id="pg-01-54" n="01:54"/>some dozen or two of the books; and I believe, that one way or other, she got them all disposed of in Dumfries, Annan, Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and the neighbourhood. The publication has been imprudently conducted&#x2014;indeed, I understand, it was only a random-shot; and the public was appealed to under great disadvantages. If Lewis could make shift to collect his scattered peices and publish again, he might rise into much higher estimation.</p>
 <p>In one of your letters, you mention the life of Grahame.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Grahame (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>), who married the eldest daughter of Richard Grahame, town clerk of Annan, in <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date> and was ordained as an Anglican clergyman in <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>. He had previously been a lawyer. See the <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11229"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> for an account of his poetry. On <date when="1815-04-04">4 April</date> Murray had written to Carlyle: &#x201C;I have lately read the life of James Grahame the author of <supplied>[The]</supplied> Sabbath&#x2014; He was born at Glasgow&#x2014;his father was a writer&#x2014;he was first a Writer to the Signet&#x2014;then an Advocate&#x2014;and at length a curate&#x2014; He was of a most serious and religious turn of mind&#x2014; He married a Miss Grahame in the Neighbourhood of Annan&#x2014;whose father was a Lawyer and town clerk of your borough&#x2014; Mr. Grahame had several children but I believe they are dead.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">The Sabbath</hi>, a poem, was published in <date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>.</note> His widow, the daughter of Rich<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Graham Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, is in Annan. She has always been noted for a shrewd turn of thinking&#x2014;and, it is said, pos<supplied>[s]</supplied>esses considerable talents for composition. Whilst a maid&#x2014;and looking forward to that state which every maid contemplates with anxious heart, it is told, that she had resolved&#x2014;never to marry a poet, a divine, or a whimsical man. All the three peculiarities met in Mr. Grahame.&#x2014; He left three children&#x2014;who are at present in our academy: two boys learning latin&#x2014;and a fine little girl learning Arithmetic &#x26; Geography with me.</p>
<p>I went to Dumfries on the <date when="1815-06-05">fifth of June</date> to witness the laying of the foundation stone of Burns&#x2019; mausoleum. There was, as is usual, an infinite deal of parade and fuss: but notwithstanding this&#x2014;it was an interesting scene.&#x2014; Unfortunate Burns! the man who views thy lowly grave, and thinks on the soaring spirit that once animated thy now slumbering dust&#x2014;who considers, that &#x2018;that mouth from which flowed eloquence and persuasion, is now filled with clay; and that heart with all its generous arteries, compressed into a clod of the valley&#x2019;,&#x2014;and still dares to &#x2018;draw thy frailties from their dread abode&#x2019;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gray&#x2019;s &#x201C;Elegy,&#x201D; XXXI, 2.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is to be a superb monument; I am only sorry it is not over his grave.&#x2014; Much ought to have been sacrificed to gain this point. When <pb id="pg-01-55" n="01:55"/>we are speaking of poets&#x2014;I am informed that Scott Irving<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mentioned in the letters of <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>.

Murray had written Carlyle on <date when="1815-04-04">4 April</date> that a subscription was on foot to get Irving and his family off to Canada with a good start since he had no hopes of earning a livelihood in Scotland.

<p>The best book I have read, since I wrote you, is Hume&#x2019;s Essays, political and literary. It is indeed a most ingenious production&#x2014;characterised by acuteness and originality, in all its parts. I have not room to tell you where I agree with its Author, and where I differ; nor how highly I admire his reasoning powers. What pity that he is a Deist! How much might his strong talents have accomplished in the cause of truth, when they did so much in that of error! It is indeed melancholy to behold so many men of talent, in our times all leaning to the same side&#x2014;but I am much inclined to believe, that the reign of infidelity is past its height. It is well remarked by Rousseau that &#x2018;he who was a deist in the eighteenth century, would very probably have been a persecutor in the days of the league&#x2019;:&#x2014;and we may observe too, that when the cob<supplied>[b]</supplied>lers &#x26; the fustain-weavers of the earth are tre<supplied>[a]</supplied>ding on the kibes<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, V, i.</note> of our sages, we look for something new. I was telling Mitchell an anecdote which may perhaps illustrate this position. It seems there are in Middlebie-parish certain long-headed &#x2018;knights of the shuttle&#x2019; and cunning workmen with the awl, who are notable deists&#x2014;some of them lifted to the dignity of <hi rend="italic">Atheists</hi>!&#x2014;deistical weavers &#x26; cob<supplied>[b]</supplied>lers who are atheists!&#x2014; What will become of La Place<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marquis de Laplace (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), French scientist.</note> and Playfair and Hume and Voltaire &#x26; the whole clan of u<supplied>[n]</supplied>prejudiced, unsophisticated ones, when the carrion and offal of creation are as unprejudiced &#x26; unsophisticated as they?</p>
<p>I had almost forgotten to thank <supplied>[you]</supplied> for my books&#x2014;they are just such as I wanted. &#x2018;Blair&#x2019; is an excellent peice&#x2014;and very cheap.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18150201-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1815-02-01">1 Feb. 1814 [1815]</date></ref>. In TM to TC, <date when="1815-03-25">25 March</date>, Murray lists the books he is sending to Carlyle as Blair, Playfair, Italian dictionary, Novelle Morali, Grammar, and Tardy. The total cost was &#xa3;2.11. Tardy is a French dictionary.</note> I <pb id="pg-01-56" n="01:56"/>am only sorry you sent <hi rend="italic">it</hi> at all: I was in no particular want of it &#x26; you ought certainly to have done with the money whatever your situation required.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray had written to Carlyle on <date when="1815-03-25">25 March</date> that he had delayed getting the books as he had needed money and had used Carlyle&#x2019;s. He added that if the fifteen shillings left over was not required at once he could make use of it. He said: &#x201C;I intended once not to send you &#x2018;Blair&#x2019; in order to have more money in my hands&#x2014; I am getting eight new Shirts only which I have calculated will cost me altogether <hi rend="italic">five pounds</hi>.&#x201D; He needed money to equip himself for his post.</note>&#x2014; One is apt to be <hi rend="italic">put about</hi>, when obliged to equip for such an expedition as yours.&#x2014; The Italian grammar is hardly calculated for me&#x2014;but answers in the mean time. The <hi rend="italic">Novelle morale</hi> is an excellent book for the purpose<supplied>[.]</supplied> I am toiling away, beak and talons, at the study of it: and had I perseverance, I would make proficiency.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I received your last letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray had written last on <date when="1815-06-29">29 June</date>.</note> at a time when after my defaults, I had little reason to expect it; and I proudly resolved not to be behind my time again. Resolutions, as your favourite Young so pathetically laments, are too often made only to be broken<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Young (<date when="1683-00-00">1683</date>&#x2013;<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>), <hi rend="italic">Night Thoughts</hi>, I, 417 ff.</note>&#x2014;and I am a melancholy instance of the truth of this observation.&#x2014; I will not tire you with trite excuses&#x2014;you know me well enough to be convinced that few things give me more pleasure than a letter from you; and bearing this in mind, you may impute my silence to whatever cause you will:&#x2014;call it business or laziness, sickness or sorrow&#x2014;only forget it, and all will be well.</p>
<p>Our holidays commence in a few days; and you may easily conceive, I have resolved many a plan for passing them to most advantage.&#x2014; I was struck at the hint you give of the possibility of our meeting in Autumn and had well nigh resolved to visit Galloway for this end.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray had written on <date when="1815-06-29">29 June</date>: &#x201C;I shall endeavour either to be in Edinburgh with you at Christmas, or visit you <foreign><hi rend="italic">en passant</hi></foreign> at your &#x2018;own house&#x2019;&#x2014; I have a strong desire to visit Annandale. &#x2026; What will you do in Harvest? I would be exceedingly happy to see you in Galloway where I am sure you might spend some days pleasantly.&#x201D; In reply to this letter from Carlyle, he wrote on <date when="1815-08-27">27 Aug.</date> vehemently urging Carlyle to come and minimizing the difficulties.</note> But I naturally dislike locomotion, and when I came to reflect on the hardships of a solitary excursion of eighty miles, I was obliged to lay aside my scheme. Sometimes I am for visiting Dublin&#x2014;but I believe all that I could see there would hardly compensate for the trouble of going and returning. At other times, I am decidedly of opinion, that I ought to visit the lakes of Cumberland;&#x2014; &#x2018;Til reflecting on the swarms of amateurs, attorneys, esquires, clothiers, nabobs, <foreign><hi rend="italic">hoc genus omne</hi></foreign> [all of this sort]<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>, I, ii, 2.</note> that at that time there ride prosperously&#x2014;to put the poor pedestrian to the blush, I rejoice that I am far from Keswick:&#x2014;so that you see my projects are no sooner formed than laid aside. I expect, after all, that I shall continue during the whole of my leisure time&#x2014;at Ecclefechan in a state of vegetation or torpor.&#x2014; By the way could you get your liberty for two or three days to see your friends in Girthon? If so who knows but I could prevail upon <pb id="pg-01-58" n="01:58"/>myself to come as far as Gatehouse and see you? I doubt you will not be able to get away, and consequently this must be given up too. I wish you would think of it however; and let me know your opinion directly.&#x2014;</p>
 <p>I am happy to find you so agreeably situated in Wigtown. Mrs Tweedal has a sister married to Mr Church<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Johnston was later employed by him.</note> of Hitchill, an extensive and respectable farmer in this neighbourhood. I was at their house last Saturday &#x26; Sunday. They are excellent people. Mrs Church was mentioning you, and observing that she had received a letter from her sister stating her high satisfaction with Mr Murray.&#x2014; Have you ever seen Miss Murray,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray had written on <date when="1815-06-29">29 June</date>: &#x201C;The Governess who was in the family before me tho she has left them lives in Wigtown.&#x201D;</note> your former governess? It seems, she is a very sensible young lady&#x2014;provided she incline not to the redoubtable sisterhood of <foreign><hi rend="italic">bas bleus</hi></foreign> [bluestockings]. I like originals above all things.&#x2014; You have no doubt, a large quantity of female beauty in the shire, and I hope and trust that among those provincial cynosures, you pass your time with much <foreign><hi rend="italic">gaiet&#xE9; de coeur</hi></foreign> [gaiety of heart]. Do not get in love&#x2014;if you can help it.&#x2014; Probably you are not far from New Galloway; and if so, you will sometimes see Andrew&#x2014;give my respects to him if you fall in with him. James Campbell<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Campbell (<date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>&#x2013;<sic><date when="1832-00-00">1832</date></sic><corr><date when="1831-00-00">1831</date></corr>). See the <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4507"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> for his difficulties with the other sex.</note> is a native of that part of the country too:&#x2014;have you heard whether he is returned from the Continent? It was talked about Castlemilk not long ago, that Mrs Hart was scampering from one end of France to the other, with much velocity and an extensive suite (Campbell would be with her) whilst the Major was at London, with his fortune and shoulder-blade broken&#x2014;obliged to sell his cattle and his stuff to support her extravagance</p>
<p>I was at Ruthwell lately. Mitchell has been very sick&#x2014; The Doctor says he is threatened with a consumption.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He eventually died of it.</note> He has been at Dublin, for the benefit of the sea-air; and I would hope is out of danger.&#x2014; Honest Andr<supplied>[e]</supplied>w Beattie<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;son of cat-gut.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18141018-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1814-10-18">18 Oct. 1814</date></ref>.</note> is gone to America! Mitchell tells me that &#x2018;whilst some of the men of Corrie were weeping bitterly and making great mourning at his departure; our man of music shouldered his fiddle, and actually played them a spring&#x2019;. He was going &#x2018;he kent nocht where&#x2019;&#x2014;to Canada or Carolina&#x2014;give him rice to plant and fear him never.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-59" n="01:59"/>When you saw that long story about &#x2018;thunder&#x2019;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Two long letters dealing with thunder signed &#x201C;Ichneutes&#x201D; (he who hunts or tracks down) and dated at Ecclefechan on <date when="1815-06-01">1</date> and <date when="1815-06-08">8 June</date> appeared in the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> on <date when="1815-06-06">6</date> and <date when="1815-06-20">20 June</date>. Both were by Carlyle. Robert Mitchell wrote to him in <date when="1815-08-00">August</date>: &#x201C;I was very glad to see you thundering away under the designation of Ichneutes&#x201D;; and Murray wrote to him on <date when="1815-06-29">29 June</date>: &#x201C;I was &#x2018;electrified&#x2019; to see your learned essay on Thunder.&#x201D; In his letters to the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> Carlyle describes at length Franklin&#x2019;s theory of electricity and suggests that the noise of thunder is caused by vibration and by air rushing to fill a vacuum. In his second letter he corrects textual errors in the first and writes about the connection of electricity with earthquakes, monsoons, etc., and about the function of conductors. A letter signed &#x201C;A Gallovidian&#x201D; and dated <date when="1815-06-14">14 June</date> appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> on <date when="1815-07-11">11 July</date>. It suggested that electricity is related to heat and may cause it by friction to affect the nature of the atmosphere and to regulate the solar system. It is not inappropriate that Carlyle&#x2019;s first published essay of any length should deal with thunder and lightning.</note> you would mark me down for one po<supplied>[s]</supplied>sessed&#x2014;with the rage of writing. Nevertheless it was no such thing. I cannot take time to explain it&#x2014;but the publication was purely the effect of <foreign><hi rend="italic">ennui</hi></foreign>. Who was that &#x2018;Gallovidian&#x2019; that conjectured so bravely upon Electricity? Mitchell says it was you. I might have made some remarks upon it had I seen it when it first appeared but it was two or three weeks old before I heard of it&#x2014;and long ere that, both it and Ichneutes had journeyed to the land of forgetfulness. Are you in the way of writing any thing at present? It is long since you appeared in print now.</p>
<p>I was re<supplied>[a]</supplied>ding lately, Stewarts life of Robertson, Smith&#x2019;s wealth of nations, and Kames&#x2019; Essays on the principles of morality.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dugald Stewart, <hi rend="italic">Account of the Life and Writings of William Robertson</hi> (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>); Adam Smith (<date when="1723-00-00">1723</date>&#x2013;<date when="1790-00-00">90</date>), <hi rend="italic">The Wealth of Nations</hi> (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>); Henry Home, Lord Kames (<date when="1696-00-00">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>), <hi rend="italic">Essays on the Principles of Morality and Natural Religion</hi> (<date when="1751-00-00">1751</date>).</note> The first is a sensible sort of book&#x2014;unworthy, however, of Stewart. Dr Smith is a man of much research, &#x26; appears to understand completely all the bearings of his complicated subject. I have read his first and second volumes with much pleasure. He always writes like a philosopher. With regard to Lord Kames&#x2014;his works are generally all an awkward compound of ingenuity and absurdity and in this volume the latter quality it appears to me, considerably preponderates. It is Metaphysical; upon Belief, identity, Necessity &#x26;c &#x26;c and I devoutly wish that no friend of mine may ever come to study it&#x2014;unless he wish to learn&#x2014;</p>

<p>I leave Annan on Friday&#x2014; Direct your next letter to me at Ecclefechan. Tell me, in what state of forwardness is your discourse? I too have an Exegesis to write&#x2014;but when&#x2014;is another circumstances. To be serious, Tom, I am growing daily and hourly more lukewarm about this preaching business.&#x2014; The trade (for it is become a trade) is completely overstocked. And independently of this how would it suit one&#x2019;s humour&#x2014;after spending the flower of ones life in the service of some pitiful country &#x2019;squire&#x2014;to be obliged after all to flatter and wheedle his piques and prejudices in order to obtain&#x2014;a country parsonage; whence after spinning out a few years of dreary existence, to &#x2018;drop into the grave unpitied &#x26; unknown&#x2019;?<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Beattie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Minstrel</hi>, l. 9.</note>&#x2014; In this neighbourhood there are several students of divinity who, unless turned out to grass have no prospect of obtaining a livelihood at all. This looks badly.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Can you tell me any more news of Caven and Laurie? They are strange characters&#x2014; I wonder how Joseph<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Lowry.

<p><salute>My Dear Murray&#x2014;&#x2014;</salute>It is with great grief of heart that I acknowledge myself again to blame. I know, it is some months since I should have written you.&#x2014;nay, for that matter it is some months since I should have visited you in Galloway<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1815-08-27">27 Aug.</date> had urged Carlyle to make the visit.</note>&#x2014; And (<foreign><hi rend="italic">proh! pudor</hi></foreign>) [shame upon me!] at this present date, I have neither visited nor written you. I confess my faults; and tho&#x2019; I cannot entirely excuse&#x2014;I pretend to state such circumstances as will greatly palliate them.&#x2014; The visit to <pb id="pg-01-61" n="01:61"/>Galloway was an excursion from which, after your last letter, I had promised myself much gratification: and I certainly did design, in due time to accomplish it. But alas! I was attracted to the circuit-trials by a rumour that Francis Jeffrey Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Jeffrey (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), previously mentioned in <ref target="volume-01/lt-18140824-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, 
<date when="1814-08-24">24 Aug. 1814</date></ref>. The friendship of the two Carlyles with him was to be extremely important. See Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> and innumerable passages in letters to follow.</note> was to be one of the pleaders! I went to Dumfries accordingly&#x2014;but Francis Jeffrey Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi> did not make his appearance, and I only derived from my journey&#x2014;the satisfaction of hearing and feeling the remarks and wit of sundry bums<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Those who read badly or drone as they read in the manner of some preachers. A rare word. The American meaning of tramp or ne&#x2019;er-do-well is much later in origin.</note> and turnkeys, as, by means of their lungs and batons, they performed their part in the scene&#x2014;and of witnessing a most edifying display of indictments and interlocutors&#x2014;rendered doubly impressive by my being all the while surrounded and overpowered by a load of tinkers and shoe-blacks.&#x2014; This was sufficient to prevent my expedition. For before I had returned home and got myself in readiness, the weather was broken&#x2014;and before the weather mended, my time was expired. So that, you see, I am pardonable on that head.&#x2014; With regard to the letter,&#x2014;I intended as soon as I got to Annan, to send you an account of these circumstances as an explanation of my nonappearance:&#x2014;but here again I was disappointed. About this time, it occurred to me, that I had two exercises from the Divinity Hall&#x2014;and that it would be proper to set about discovering what were their contents&#x2014;and what was to become of them. It occurred to me; much about the same time that it would be proper to study Stewart&#x2019;s Essays, Berkel<supplied>[e]</supplied>y&#x2019;s principles of knowledge, Rumfords Essays, Newton<supplied>[&#x2019;s]</supplied> Institutes, Simpson&#x2019;s Fluxions<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18151211-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1815-12-11">11 Dec.</date></ref> Sir Isaac Newton (<date when="1642-00-00">1642</date>&#x2013;<date when="1727-00-00">1727</date>).</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014; If to these overpowering engagements, you add the numberless fits of indolence&#x2014;and the perpetual visitations of spleen, to which one is subjected in this dirty little uncomfortable planet of ours&#x2014;I presume you will have a sufficient excuse for my silence; and will rather wonder indeed that you have heard from me at all. To be honest&#x2014;I will confess to you (for seriously I am excessively busied) that I doubt much whether I could have prevailed upon myself to write even now&#x2014;had it not been to consult you about our journey to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, the time for which is fast approaching.&#x2014; I want to know whether you have any discourse ready: and if so whether you design to give it in, this winter. I set about writing one some time ago: and at last <pb id="pg-01-62" n="01:62"/>(and let <supplied>[us]</supplied> be thankful) I have something put together in the shape of an answer to the question &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">num detur religio naturalis</hi></foreign>?&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s thesis subject: &#x201C;Is there a natural religion?&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; Very little of it is yet translated: So that you see, tho&#x2019; I had nothing else to mind it would be employment enough for the time that remains&#x2014; I have however twenty other things equally pressing to attend to:&#x2014;and this, by the way, will excuse the blunders of this hasty letter.&#x2014; But what I desire of you at present is to write immediately to some of our Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> friends (Mr. Andrew or? Maclaurin<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >McLaurin was John Fergusson&#x2019;s cousin.</note> or any other) to engage a day (if you read this winter, of course we appear together) for our &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">delivering</hi>&#x2019; in the Divinity Hall. But what is to be particularly attended to, is&#x2014;that unless the day be one one [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] immediately bordering upon the Christmas recess&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> day before or at any rate the one preceding that&#x2014;I cannot <hi rend="italic">read</hi> this year. I request you will desire your correspondent to mention the circumstances to the Doctor&#x2014;and examine forthwith whether the day is to be procured. If Dr. Ritchie<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Ritchie (<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date> or late <date when="1747-00-00">1747</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), professor of divinity at Edinburgh University, <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">28</date>.</note> cannot suspend his lecturing for a day&#x2014;and if the reading day immediately before the recess be engaged&#x2014;possibly our friend could induce some of its present occupants to give up their rights. Christmas I think falls on a Monday&#x2014;and the saturday preceding, may possibly be unengaged&#x2014;in which case the Doctor I think could devote it to this purpose&#x2014;and if you read (as I hope you have determined to do: and if not I earnestly wish you would set about preparing&#x2014; I could not think of mounting the rostrum by myself&#x2014;at the fag end of a (Doctor&#x2019;s) lecture)&#x2014;if you <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, this will answer pretty well.&#x2014;you know my circumstances&#x2014;and I leave the management of this affair entirely to your discretion; and if a day cannot conveniently be had&#x2014;it makes no great difference.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See TM to TC, <date when="1815-12-08">8 Dec.</date>; <ref target="volume-01/lt-18151211-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1815-12-11">11 Dec.</date></ref></note> I am aware that I am giving you a very great deal of trouble&#x2014;but I need not take up time in apologies: I hope I can apply to you with security about such a matter; and if I did not I should not have mentioned the subject at all. What I particularly request is expedition&#x2014;lest the day be engaged. You will get this about friday; say you write to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Saturday&#x2014;demanding an answer in great haste&#x2014;and get one about the end of next week; I will hope and expect to hear from you an account of the result about the <date when="1815-12-07">7 [December]</date>. You will think me forward and confident enough after my <pb id="pg-01-63" n="01:63"/>own negligence&#x2014;but I rely on your good nature&#x2014;and I entreat you use expedition for I am anxious to know the issue.</p>
<p>This is one of the dullest letters in the world. Indeed how could it be otherwise? Overwhelmed by differential calculi, secondary qua<supplied>[nt]</supplied>ities, and systems of of [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] pneumatics, ontology, theology and cosmogeny&#x2014;it is wonderful that I have heart enough lef<supplied>[t]</supplied> to write at all. But, <supplied>[my good]</supplied> Murray, get me these matters cleverly managed&#x2014;and I engage <supplied>[to make]</supplied> up for all deficiencies in good time.</p>
<p>I have not heard a syllable of our acquaintances <supplied>[for ma]</supplied>ny days&#x2014; They may be all at the bottom of the sea for any th<supplied>[ing I kn]</supplied>ow about them.&#x2014; I might mention that I saw (did not speak to) Carson of Gatehouse<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray replied, <date when="1815-12-08">8 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;You diverted me highly about &#x2018;Mrs W.

James Johnson says he saw in the newspaper&#x2019;s that &#x2018;Mrs W.

<salute>My Dear Mitchell,</salute>
<p>I opened your last letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell&#x2019;s letter is dated <date when="1815-11-30">30 Nov.</date></note> with fear and trembling. I expected nothing but reproaches;&#x2014;when lo! my sins are laid upon the back of the unoffending Post John, and I am never blamed.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After expressing his disappointment at not getting a letter from Carlyle, Mitchell had said: &#x201C;I was very much surprised at this&#x2014;and am rather inclined to think that John must have lost it.&#x201D;</note> Indeed, Mitchell, you have been too good: and I look for nothing but that you will be ready to slay me, when you come to know that I have never written you at all&#x2014; I beseech you let not your wrath be kindled. Stay till you have heard my piteous circumstances:&#x2014;and I am persuaded, you will pardon me.&#x2014; I might justly preface my account with an<foreign> <hi rend="italic">infandum regina</hi></foreign>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Infandum regina jubes renovare dolorem&#x201D;</hi></foreign>: &#x201C;Unspeakable, O Queen, is the grief you bid me renew&#x201D; (Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, II, 3).</note> but to proceed without ornament&#x2014; &#x201C;Ye probably may not know those lines of <hi rend="italic">Scaliger</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Justus Scaliger (<date when="1540-00-00">1540</date>&#x2013;<date when="1609-00-00">1609</date>), French scholar of Italian extraction.</note> [applied to dictionary-makers, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis</hi></foreign> to dictionary-users] <foreign><hi rend="italic">Si quem dura manet sententia judicisolim</hi></foreign> &#x26;c&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Lexica contexat, nam caetera, quid moror? omnes poenarum facies, hic labor unus habet</hi></foreign>.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;If a harsh sentence of a judge awaits anyone hereafter &#x26;c.&#x2014;let him compile lexicons, for, as to the rest, why do I waste time? every kind of punishment is contained in this one labor.&#x201D; The preceding brackets are Carlyle&#x2019;s.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014; You certainly imagine, I am got terribly learned since I saw you&#x2014; But fair and softly&#x2014;I know nothing at all about honest Scaliger; and &#x2018;those lines&#x2019; of his are, I believe, none of the most honestly come by:&#x2014;I conveyed them (<hi rend="italic">convey</hi> the wise it call) from Morell&#x2019;s preface to Ainsworth&#x2019;s dictionary<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Ainsworth (<date when="1660-00-00">1660</date>&#x2013;<date when="1743-00-00">1743</date>), <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Linguae Latinae Compendarius</hi> (<date when="1736-00-00">1736</date>).

After parting from you at Ruthwell&#x2014;I consumed the remainder of our vacation, in sundry idle projects: one of which was&#x2014;going to Dumfries, and suffering &#x2018;the pain of three intolerable deaths&#x2019;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a reference to <hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi>, III, v.</note> for the purpose <supplied>[of]</supplied> hearing certain wise and faithful counsellors display their eloquence at the circuit trials.&#x2014; When I returned to Annan, it occurred to me, that it would be proper to see what was become of my Hall discourses.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The work being prepared for Divinity Hall in Edinburgh.</note> It occurred to me, much about the same time, that it would be proper to study Rumfords essays, Mackenzies travels, Humboldts New Spain, Berkeley&#x2019;s principles of knowledge, Stewarts essays Simson&#x2019;s fluxions &#x26;c &#x26;c &#x26;c<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford (<date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>), <hi rend="italic">Essays, Political Economical and Philosophical</hi> (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>); Sir George Stewart Mackenzie (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), <hi rend="italic">Travels in the Island of Iceland during the Summer of <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date></hi> (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>); Friedrich von Humboldt (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), <hi rend="italic">Essai politique sur la royaume de la nouvelle Espagne</hi> (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>); George Berkeley (<date when="1685-00-00">1685</date>&#x2013;<date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>), <hi rend="italic">Treatise concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge</hi> (<date when="1710-00-00">1710</date>); Dugald Stewart, <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Essays</hi> (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>); Thomas Simpson (<date when="1710-00-00">1710</date>&#x2013;<date when="1761-00-00">61</date>), <hi rend="italic">A Treatise of Fluxions</hi> (<date when="1737-00-00">1737</date>).</note>&#x2014; It was some great man&#x2019;s advice, to every person in a hurry&#x2014;never to do more than one thing at a time.

Upon consideration, therefore, of these egregious labours&#x2014;I hope, you cannot refuse to forgive me.</p>
<p>I am anxious to consult you about going to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> this winter. I have already partly told you that I have been making my Exigesis. It is now nearly finished;&#x2014;and truly a most delectable production it is&#x2014;but of this some other time. I wrote to Murray in great haste, to commission me a day&#x2014;and it seems, I am engaged to read on Friday the 22<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> currt.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18151128-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1815-11-28">28 Nov.</date></ref> Murray had replied, <date when="1815-12-08">8 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;Mr Milroy to whom I entrusted the management of the Affair, writes me&#x2014;&#x2018;I have the pleasure of informing you that Mr Carlyle&#x2019;s business is successfully terminated. His day is Friday the 22nd Curr<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.&#x2019;&#x201D; Murray goes on to say that one Colville has been persuaded to give up his day and that Carlyle owes the persuaders a bottle of whisky.</note>&#x2014; So that you see my time of setting out is decided upon.&#x2014; You will ask me, why, since I have almost come to a determination about my fitness for the study of Divinity, why all this mighty stir&#x2014;why this ado&#x2014;about &#x2018;delivering&#x2019; a thesis&#x2014;that in the minds eye seems vile&#x2014;and in the nostril smells horrible?<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blair, <hi rend="italic">The Grave</hi>, ll. 170&#x2013;71.</note> It is not because I <pb id="pg-01-66" n="01:66"/>have altered my sentiments about the study of theology: but principally because it came into my head, to try what sort of an essay upon natural religion, I could make I have tried and find accordingly that I can make one perfectly&#x2014;&#x2018;weary, flat, stale and unprofitable&#x2019;&#x2014; but I am engaged and must read it now.&#x2014; I do not e<supplied>[.]</supplied>xpect yet, that you will be able to tell me &#x2018;whether the sabbath is of divine institution&#x2019;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the subject of Mitchell&#x2019;s thesis.</note>&#x2014;but I do hope, you have determined to go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> this winter along with me. If you have not&#x2014;I must not try to persuade you.&#x2014; You would suspect that my arguments arose from selfish motives&#x2014; And you would not be far from right; for if you do not go, I shall be the most melancholy person imaginable. But I cannot help bringing to your recollection, the possibility that you may change your opinion about becoming a clergyman&#x2014;in which case your annual visit to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> will be of essential service. It does good, at any rate&#x2014;by preventing that pity which certain people of grave minds are so disposed to bestow on every one that has not a fixed prospect in life&#x2014;and over and above, it is pleasant to revisit one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">alma mater</hi>. For these reasons and for one (I confess it) as strong as any&#x2014;that I shall be uncomfortable if you refuse&#x2014;I earnestly wish you to determine upon this journey.&#x2014; I must set out on Wednesday the 20th, in order to reach Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in time. Now could not you, take an inside-seat in the coach and leave Dumfries on Thursday morning&#x2014;whilst I set out from Ecclefechan on Wednesday evening by the Glasgow Mail&#x2014;having previously secured a seat from Dumfries to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;and meet you at Moffatt? We should thus proceed merrily to the capital&#x2014;and I promise not to be sticklish about leaving it, whenever you please. You must revolve all this in your mind&#x2014;and after serious and mature deliberation&#x2014;let me know on thursday morning&#x2014;that you have made up your mind to go. I say Thursday-morning&#x2014;for we shall have little enough time after that to take the necessary measures. You <hi rend="italic">must</hi> [underscored twice] write on Thursday<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell did not go to Edinburgh with Carlyle but replied, <date when="1815-12-13">13 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;With your request I cannot comply&#x2014; The Reason is simply this&#x2014;I intend to read a Discourse this year and it is not <hi rend="italic">begun</hi>.&#x201D; By <hi rend="italic">year</hi> he presumably meant session; hence, he planned to deliver his discourse in <date when="1816-04-00">April</date>.</note></p>

Mitchell could talk with the Swiss only in French, and conversation had been difficult.</note>&#x2014; With all imaginable deference to those that practise the sublime virtue of Charity;&#x2014;I cannot altogether see, what concern the peaceable inhabitants of Dumfriesshire have with the management of the convents situated among the glaciers of the Alps. Had the task of repairing their breaches been consigned to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">virtuosi</hi></foreign> and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">cognoscenti</hi></foreign> that frequent those regions, it might have been more befitting.&#x2014; But &#x2018;all for the honour of England.&#x2019;<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Newspaper phrase.</note></p>
<p>Can you tell me whether Davie Graham is continuing to practice physic? He is a good honest lad:&#x2014;I am only afraid that the aphorisms of Celsus will not answer the men of Tundergarth.<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Celsus was a Latin encyclopedist and writer who flourished in the <date>first century <hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi></date> Tundergarth is a parish in Dumfriesshire near Lockerbie.</note>&#x2014; And Andrew!&#x2014; <pb id="pg-01-68" n="01:68"/>alas! the green ocean is betwixt us! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Illi robur et aes triplex circa pectus erat</hi></foreign>.<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi>, I, iii, 9&#x2013;11. The rest of the quotation is: &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">qui fragilem truci commisit pelago ratim primus</hi></foreign>.&#x201D; The whole quotation may be translated: &#x201C;Oak and triple bronze must have girt the breast of him who first committed his frail bark to the angry sea.&#x201D; Carlyle refers to Andrew Beattie&#x2019;s crossing of the Atlantic.</note></p>
<p>The fate of poor Andrew disposes one to be melancholy.&#x2014; What is to become of us, Mitchell? The period of our boyhood is past:&#x2014; and in a little while, if we live, behold we shall be bearded men! from whom wisdom and gravity will be required. It is now a year since we last visited Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014; For my part, tho&#x2019; I have laboured as I could in my vocation, I can<supplied>[not say]</supplied> that I am either wiser or better in any perceptible d<supplied>[egree&#x2014;]</supplied> out upon <supplied>[it]</supplied>! this is a miserable world.</p>
<p>But let us quit moralizing&#x2014;and bethink us of our journey.&#x2014; You must write me on thursday&#x2014;that you will be ready at the time.&#x2014; I cannot think of any excuse you can plead with any chance of success. Are you afraid lest it hurt your health? Wrap yourself up in your rouquelaure&#x2014;and you can take no harm. You have been curling<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell had written, <date when="1815-11-30">30 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;We have been busy at Curling these 10 days but I am afraid the frost has left us.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;and I am happy to believe&#x2014;you have got sound again.&#x2014;you certainly will come.</p>
<p>I know not whether you will have heard&#x2014;that I am living with Mr Glen since I came to Annan last. He is a real good man as far as I can see; and Mrs Glen is a fine cheerful woman&#x2014;so that upon the whole, I am not uncomfortable in my present circumstances. Most of the ministers that come here (no great number, let me be thankful) are curious bodies:&#x2014;but I will speak of this elsewhere&#x2014; In the mean time&#x2014;I must again repeat my petition&#x2014;and hope that in a short time we shall be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> together.&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>My Dear Mitchell&#x2014;</salute>I know, I should have written you, a month ago; and I am not going to take up your time with excuses. I have indeed no excuse, except the perpetually forthcoming one&#x2014;no time and no <pb id="pg-01-69" n="01:69"/>subject; and it would be but aggravating my misconduct, to harangue you upon a topic that has been so fully discussed by every writer of letters in every age of the world. The truth is&#x2014;I have been a very torpid person of late. After undergoing the fatigues of a most uncomfortable journey to Edinburgh, I returned with renewed keenness to my old habits of seclusion an<supplied>[d]</supplied> repose&#x2014;to reading when I was able, and when I was not, to the forming of vain hopes and silly projects, at which I have a peculiar knack.&#x2014; But tho&#x2019; I have not written to you, I have had you often in my mind. Many a time during my dreary pilgrimage to Edin. did I solace myself with the hope of making you merry with the recital of my adventures:&#x2014;a hope which (as you are just going to see) has, like many other hopes, proved utterly fallacious.</p>
<p>I left Ecclefechan on the evening of tuesday the <date when="1815-12-19">19<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date> on the top of the Glasgow Mail. Little occurred worthy of notice, till on my arrival at Moffatt, I discovered among my fellow travellers, along with three Lancashire cotton men, a pure species of the <hi rend="italic">popinjay</hi>&#x2014;of whom all that I can now say, is that he was much shocked at seeing <supplied>[no]</supplied> &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">roasbeef fo suppa</hi>,&#x2019; and expressed his grief and surprise by several nondescript interjections; that he was unable to determine whether the fowl on the table was a tame duck or wild, and thereupon &#x2018;did patiently incline&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, I, iii.</note> to the reasonings of an ancient Scottish <hi rend="italic">gourmand</hi> who at length succeeded in settling his mind upon this important subject; and that upon my inquiring after the news of the paper which he was reading, he informed me that the <hi rend="italic">Aachdoocs</hi> had returned to England, and that (this he preluded by three nods of satisfaction) the Prince Regent was gone to Brighton.</p>
<p>The next day I had different objects to speculate upon. I was mounted on the roof of the coach in one of the most dismal days I ever saw. It snowed heavily; on our arrival at Erockstane<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170925-TC-JJ-01">TC to JJ, <date when="1817-09-25">25 Sept. 1817</date></ref>.</note> particularly, the roaring of the wind and the ocean of drift carried with it&#x2014;together with the bellowings of the distracted coachmen, and the outlandish warwhoops of two Irish Doctors who along with myself had dismounted till we should ascend the hill&#x2014;formed a scene sufficiently wild. Of this I intended for your benefit, a very pathetic description&#x2014;as well as of the desolation of the Broughton inn&#x2014;where after a day of violent struggling we finally stopt. The kitchen, I remember, when I entered it, was filled with shepherds and carriers&#x2014;and in the midst, like a <pb id="pg-01-70" n="01:70"/>breathing Iceberg, stood our guard describing with much emphasis the hardships of the day.&#x2014; Two female passengers had taken pos<supplied>[s]</supplied>ession of another quarter of the house&#x2014;and left the two Hibernians and me to pass the evening as we best were able. I did not, by any means like my comorades. One of them (according to my conceptions)&#x2014;but that he from time to time uttered certain acute sounds&#x2014;and had a pair of little fiery eyes,&#x2014;pretty much resembled an Egyptian mummy&#x2014;a little meagre thing&#x2014;skin apparently of the nature of parchment&#x2014;and a complexion that seemed to have been produced by repeated immersion in strong decoctions of logwood. The other had a Kilmarnock bonnet.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Kilmarnock bonnet, named for a burgh in Ayrshire, now usually called a tam-o'-shanter.</note> Both seemingly exceeding vain as well as stupid. I spent an unhappy evening. The mummy blew upon a German flute&#x2014;and both talked of Antrim and Drogheda<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Antrim is a maritime county in Ulster; Drogheda is a seaport and manufacturing center in County Louth.</note>&#x2014;till I had come to a resolution of leaving them next morning at all hazards.&#x2014; I must not neglect to tell you of our dormitory&#x2014;finding, there was only one bed allotted for us all, and wisely judging it prudent to make the best of a bad bargain, the mum<supplied>[m]</supplied>y took pos<supplied>[s]</supplied>ession of the middle. There is no happiness, it is said, without alloy&#x2014;at least it proved so in this case; for altho&#x2019; by this manoeuvre the mummy secured a comfortable proportion of warmth&#x2014;yet the pressure of the Kilmarnock-bonnetman upon his fragile sides seemed considerably to damp his enjoyments. It became at length so intolerable, indeed, as to compel him (after a desperate and ineffectual effort at release) to exclaim &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Marciful</hi> Heaven&#x2014;preserve my <hi rend="italic">sowl</hi>&#x2014;what will become of me now?&#x2019;&#x2014; The bitter whine in which this sentiment was uttered, and the sudden nature of such a preparation for dissolution (which, I might have inferred from the words, he expected forthwith) would in any other circumstances have overcome my gravity.</p>
<p>I left them next morning and set out on my forlorn expedition at four o&#x2019;clock. It was truly an Icelandic scene. The wind had subsided during the night&#x2014;all was silent&#x2014;and the moon disclosed the dreary expanse of snow&#x2014;which in many places was d<supplied>[r]</supplied>ifted into heaps of several feet in depth. I made but indifferent progress&#x2014;for after infinite flounderings (at one time, literally up to the chin in snow) the sun rose upon me in the wolds of Lintoun. The track was entirely obliterated&#x2014;and I suppose I was beginning to look silly enough&#x2014;when <pb id="pg-01-71" n="01:71"/>I luckily descried a benevolent herdsman who pointed out to me the road for Noblehouse<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18140618-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1814-06-18">18 June 1814</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;from which I had deviated at the suggestion of a roadman, at whose cottage I had called, and who thought the higher road would be the cleaner. I was glad to meet, at Noblehouse, with a Thos Clark<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a minister by that name, born in Galloway, <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>, ordained in <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>, and died in <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>.</note> Divinity student whom I had known in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. He was preparing to mount on horseback, and in the meantime introduced me to a tall thin man who he said intended to walk to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. having been long disappointed of a passage in the coach. There was a stagnant placidity in this persons countenance which inclined me to believe, that he would prove a sufficiently inoffensive companion. He did turn out a very shallow man. He questioned the workmen whom we passed, with much minuteness, concerning the state of the <hi rend="italic">rods</hi> that were before us&#x2014;And conversed with me upon no subject but that of the effects of snow upon human bodies&#x2014;seeming particularly anxious about the fate of his own <hi rend="italic">vile carrion</hi>. He tired; and I left him at Pennicuik sitting with a kindred spirit&#x2014;to all appearance, a Peebles weaver. I pursued my journey with unabating velocity &#x26; arrived at John Forrests<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His lodgings in Edinburgh.</note> at last about seven o&#x2019;clock. I never was more happy at seeing Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>.</p>
<p>I gave in my discourse next day along with Samuel Caven<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also <ref target="volume-01/lt-18141024-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1814-10-24">24 Oct. 1814</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-01/lt-18150621-TC-TM-01">TC to <sic>RM</sic><corr>TM</corr>, <date when="1815-06-21">21 June 1815</date></ref>.</note> and another whom I did not know. It was sustained without difficulty. Caven&#x2019;s was a precious morsel. Its author it seems is in some family in the East Country.&#x2014; He is a jumbling person to speak with; &#x2018;he says an infinite deal of nothing; his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff&#x2014;you shall seek all day ere you find them&#x2014;and when you have them&#x2014;they are not worth the search.&#x2019;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Merchant of Venice</hi>, I, i.</note> But&#x2014;enough of him.&#x2014; Our old College cronies have left Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> nearly to a man.&#x2014; Waugh<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Waugh from Annandale, his second cousin.</note> still continues there teaching and learning with all his might.

<p>But I must close this long letter. I have as you see devoted the night to writing my adventures.

<p>Notwithstanding my misdeeds, I will ask you for a letter&#x2014;and a pretty early one too.

<p><salute>My Good lad&#x2014;</salute>You must be aware, that I have a right to rate you with considerable acrimony. Last time I saw you, you promised to send me a letter in a few days; yet several weeks have elapsed, and no letter has appeared. This is very blameworthy. But I need not scold you; for, in all probability, by the time you have studied the following disquisition&#x2014;you will think yourself punished to the full. It is one of the theorems, we were speaking of. I found it out some weeks ago; and an odd fancy struck me of turning the demonstration into the Latin tongue. My dialect of that language is, I doubt not, somewhat peculiar&#x2014;and you may chance to find some difficulty in interpreting it.</p>

Translation of solution: Let ABC be a triangle. Let perpendicular BD be dropped to the base AC; in it let an arbitrary point O be assumed; now, COF and AOG having been drawn, if D, F and D, G are joined, I say that angle FDA equals angle GDC. I drop, in fact, perpendiculars FE and GH. Since CE:ED : : EF:EF &#x2014; OD and AE:ED : : EF:BD &#x2014; EF, it is plain that CE: AE : : BD &#x2014; FE:EF &#x2014; OD, or by composition (as is obvious in the acute triangle) AC:AE : : BD &#x2014; DO:EF &#x2014; OD. For the same reason, it is clear that AC: CH : : BD &#x2014; DO:GH &#x2014; DO, and likewise that AE:CH : : EF &#x2014; DO:GH &#x2014; DO.

<salute>My dear friend,</salute>
<p>I am greatly obliged to you for your letter. At present, I had no great reason to expect it. Yet you must not suppose, that I have wilfully neglected to write. It is two months, since I set obstinately to work, determined to send you a very handsome letter, without loss of time. And I had assuredly done so, had I not clearly perceived, that it was not in my power to send you any thing, that could at all have interested you. Since that time I have been continually loading myself with unavailing reproaches: and I have begun to write at last, solely, lest by my silence, I should offend you without remedy. You are therefore to expect nothing but a very useless letter from me; and dull as may be.</p>
<p>I am very sorry that you are so unhappy&#x2014; It is my own case also: for I have been extremely melancholy during the last six weeks, upon many accounts. It is about ten days since I got rid of a severe inflam<supplied>[m]</supplied>ation-of the throat, which confined me to the house for two weeks. During two or three days, I was not able to speak plainly; &#x26; you will easily conceive, that I passed my time very heavily. I endeavoured to read several things: I tried a book of modern Biography &#x2018;The British Plutarch&#x2019;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Mortimer (<date when="1730-00-00">1730</date>&#x2013;<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>), <hi rend="italic">The British Plutarch</hi>, 12 vols. (<date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>).</note> but soon finding it to be a very miserable book, I shut it for good and all. I next opened the Spectator&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; his ja<supplied>[u]</supplied>nty manner but ill accorded with my sulky humours, I toiled thro&#x2019; a volume &#x26; a half, with exemplary patience. Lastly, I had recourse to Lord Chesterfield&#x2019;s advice to his son;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philip Stanhope, Fourth Earl of Chesterfield (<date when="1694-00-00">1694</date>&#x2013;<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>), <hi rend="italic">Letters to His Son</hi> (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>).</note> and I think I never before so distinctly saw the pitiful disposition of this Lord. His directions concerning washing the face &#x26; paring the nails are indeed very praiseworthy: and I should be content to see them printed in a large type, and placed in frames above the chimneypieces of boarding-schools&#x2014;for the purpose of enforcing the duties of cleanliness, upon the rising generation. But the flattery, the dissimulation &#x26; paltry cunning that he is perpetually recommending, leave one little room to regret that Chesterfield was not his father.&#x2014; Such was the result of my studies, in my sickness:&#x2014;a result highly unfavourable to those feelings of prostration <pb id="pg-01-78" n="01:78"/>before high birth &#x26; weight of purse, which (many tell us) it is so eminently the duty of all men to cultivate. Indeed this is not the first time that I have noticed in my mind, a considerable tendency to undervalue the great ones of this world. Conscious that this sentiment proceeds in a considerable degree from my situation in life, I sometimes endeavour to check it: but after all, it requires little observation to teach us that the Noble of Political society and the Noble of Nature are different persons, in nine cases out of ten. I am also aware that Flaccus has said that <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Principibus placuisse viris, non ultima laus est&#x2019;</hi></foreign>;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi>, I, xvii, 35: &#x201C;To have won favor with the foremost men is not the lowest glory.&#x201D;</note> but with great deference, I would submit to Flaccus, that the justness of his aphorism must depend upon the character of these same <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Principes viri&#x2019;</hi></foreign>; otherwise&#x2014;it is easy to conceive a state of society, in which, this &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">non ultima laus</hi></foreign>&#x2019; of his must be very liberally shared with sycophants &#x26; panders.&#x2014; But I daresay, you have enough of these reflections&#x2014; Turn we to something else.&#x2014; I daresay I know as little of Navigation as you; and yet I do not feel great difficulty, in explaining how Hamilton Moore<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hamilton Moore (d. <date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>), <hi rend="italic">The Practical Navigator</hi> (<date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>).</note> &#x201C;resolves triangles on the surface of a Sphere into plane triangles.&#x201D; Hamilton Moore, honest man, gives himself no uneasiness about resolving his triangles&#x2014;he takes them as he finds them&#x2014;and considering them as plane triangles&#x2014;solves his problems very comfortably.&#x2014; (I believe Leslie has a note in his Trigonometry, <note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir John Leslie (<date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), <hi rend="italic">Elements of Geometry, Geometrical Analysis, and Plane Trigonometry</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>).</note> explaining the method of reducing the angles of a Spherical triangle to the plane triangles formed by its chords)&#x2014; I re<supplied>[a]</supplied>dily agree with you, that Moore&#x2019;s rules are very defective:&#x2014;his remarks are often quite stupid&#x2014;for instance, his statement (noticed by Humboldt)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich von Humboldt. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18151211-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1815-12-11">11 Dec. 1815</date></ref>.</note> that the attraction of a boat to a ship or of a ship to a rock is caused by <hi rend="italic">gravitation</hi>. A Similar phenomenon may be witnessed by causing two pieces of wood to float on a bowl of water&#x2014;and all men know that this is caused by capillary attraction.&#x2014; I have never seen Kieth&#x2019;s Trigonometry,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Keith (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>), <hi rend="italic">An Introduction to the Theory and Practice of Spherical Trigonometry</hi> (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>).</note> &#x26; therefore cannot tell you any thing about it.&#x2014; I am glad to hear that you are getting forward so well with Homer. I know almost nothing about him&#x2014;having never read any thing but Pope&#x2019;s translation, and not above a single book of the original&#x2014;&#x26; that several years ago. Indeed I know very little of the Greek at any rate. I have <pb id="pg-01-79" n="01:79"/>several times begun to read Xenophon&#x2019;s anabasis completely: but always gave it up in favour of something else&#x2014; You complain that nothing that you do leaves a vestige behind it:&#x2014;what do you make of Homer?&#x2014; For my part&#x2014;I cannot well say what I have been about, since I wrote to you last. Out of a considerable quantity of garbage which I have allowed myself, at different intervals, to devour, I have only to mention Crabbes Poems as worthy of being read. In addition to great powers of correct description, he pos<supplied>[s]</supplied>esses all the sagacity of an anatomist in searching into the stormy passions of the human heart&#x2014;and all the apathy of an anatomist in describing them.&#x2014; For the rest&#x2014;I continued reading Newton&#x2019;s Principia with considerable perseverance &#x26; little success&#x2014;till on arriving a short way into the third book&#x2014;I discovered that I had too little knowledge of Astronomy, to understand his reasoning rightly. And I forthwith sent to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> for De Lambre&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">abr&#xE9;g&#xE9; d'Astronomie</hi>;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>), <hi rend="italic">Abr&#xE9;g&#xE9; d'astronomie</hi> (Paris, <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>).</note> and in the mean time, betook myself to reading Wood&#x2019;s optics. I cannot say much about this book. Its author intermeddles not with the abstruse parts of the science&#x2014;such as the causes of reflection &#x26; refraction&#x2014;the reason why transparent bodies, at given angles of incidence, reflect their light almost entirely (concerning which, I meet with many learned details, in the Encyclopedia Britan)&#x2014;but contents himself with demonstrating, in a plain enough manner, the ordinary effects of plane &#x26; spherical mirrors&#x2014;and of lenses of various kinds&#x2014;applying his doctrines, to the explanation of various optical instruments &#x26; remarkable phenomena. But in truth, I know little about it, I read it with too great velocity.&#x2014; I also read Keil&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">introductio ad veram Physicam</hi>;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Keill (<date when="1671-00-00">1671</date>&#x2013;<date when="1721-00-00">1721</date>), <hi rend="italic">Introductio ad Veram Physicam</hi> (<date when="1702-00-00">1702</date>).</note> but I shall let it pass till next time I write. In fine De Lambre arrived; &#x26; I have read into his fourth <hi rend="italic">Le&#x26;ccedil;on</hi>&#x2014;and like it greatly.I intended to have told you some of his observations&#x2014;but I would not overwhelm you with ennui all at once&#x2014;and therefore, I shall be silent at present.&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ne quid nimis</hi></foreign> [moderation in all things] &#x2026; as the proverb saith.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Terence, <hi rend="italic">Andria</hi>, I, i, 61.</note></p>
 <p>On Friday we enjoyed the company of Brother Saffery of Salisbury<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Saffrey, pastor of the Brown Street Baptist Church in Salisbury. See the article in the <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24469"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> on his second wife, Maria Grace, <hi rend="italic">n&#xE9;e</hi> Andrews, much more famous than he. This is one of the earliest of TC&#x2019;s pen portraits.</note>&#x2014;a sollicitor (of money) for the benefit of the Baptist mission. I was rather disappointed in the appearance of this person. The name <pb id="pg-01-80" n="01:80"/>of a missionary suggests the idea of a lean and mortified ascetic&#x2014;travelling with his staff &#x26; scrip&#x2014;and with pious avarice, hoarding, for the behoof of his brethren, the scanty donations of a precarious charity. Brother Saffery was the reverse of all this: He arrived in a post chaise &#x26; was a tall man of a florid complexion, and very great diameter. Nevertheless it was easy to see that his was no common character. His brow was <foreign>kint</foreign> [knit] together, very <supplied>[g]</supplied>loomily&#x2014;and his voice (naturally a deep-toned bass) was compressed into <supplied>[an]</supplied> unharmonious whine&#x2014;all denoting profound humility &#x26; passi<supplied>[ve obedien]</supplied>ce. He spoke of the designs of Providence, &#x26; the projects of the Devil, <supplied>[wi]</supplied>th great <foreign><hi rend="italic">sang froid</hi></foreign>; and quoted largely from the scripture, backing his quotations, with Wiltshire proverbs&#x2014;and other baser stuff of his own composition. His conversation, you will easily believe then, was very oppressive. Indeed so strongly did it savour of stupidity, if not of something worse, that I could not perceive it to be at all a pressing duty, to put money into the hands of persons like him, for any purpose whatever. However Brother Saffery had no great room for misguiding the talent committed to his care by the people of Annan;&#x2014;inasmuch as said talent amounted only to two pounds four shillings &#x26; sixpence&#x2014;a sum, which considering the trouble he put himself to&#x2014;was trifling enough. It is pity, that the missionaries cant so violently. There is no doubt that many of them are serious, well-meaning men&#x2014;yet it would be too much to expect that in such a number&#x2014;there should not be several&#x2014;with whom the propagation of Christianity is far from being the primary object, and of the best&#x2014;it is to be regretted that their zeal is not tempered with a little more prudence.</p>
<p>I had several other matters to write about; but my paper draws t<supplied>[o]</supplied> a close. Yet I cannot forbear noticing that strange project of going to Fra<supplied>[nce]</supplied>, which you talk of. Possibly it might be extremely pleasant&#x2014;but there are many perplexing questions to be answered, before it can be put in execution. First, how are we to get to France; second, how are we to live in France; and third what good will living in France do to us. &#x2018;Chill penury,&#x2019; My Dear Mitchell, here as in other cases, represses our &#x2018;noble rage&#x2019;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gray&#x2019;s &#x201C;Elegy,&#x201D; XIII, 3.</note> of visiting this country, and, may be, it is no great matter. For it may be doubted, one would think, whether a country inhabited by fierce revolutionists and rascally marauders &#x26; flimsy aristocrats&#x2014;all sweating under a foreign &#x26; arbitrary yoke&#x2014;would be a fit place for an honest man to dwell in&#x2014;if he could help it.&#x2014; At any rate, it seems I am to stay nearer home for a while. For you must <pb id="pg-01-81" n="01:81"/>know, I have received two letters from Professor Christison,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See MS: NLS, 665.17 and 1764.78 for these letters; also 665.19 for the Rev. J. Martin&#x2019;s letter explaining the circumstances. One of the ambiguities may be that Christison says (in <date when="1816-05-00">May</date>) that the salary will be at least &#xa3; 100. Martin (in <date when="1816-06-00">June</date>) only guarantees &#xa3;80, and clearly most of that was to come from fees, only &#xa3;25 being actually guaranteed by those running the establishment.</note> concerning the situation of Teacher to the Parish school of Kirk<supplied>[c]</supplied>aldy&#x2014;or rather I believe assistant to the present Teacher, who (being a very useless man)<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Mr. Hume, an old and inefficient teacher, who offered to resign if given his salary of &#xa3;26 a year as a pension.

Their minutes are extant (see NLS, 2883).</note> has agreed to resign&#x2014;upon consideration of being allowed to retain his salary&#x2014;retaining also the name without any of the power of Parish Schoolmaster. I cannot say that I am violently taken with this offer. The emolument is rated about a hundred a-year, but there appears to be some ambiguities about it&#x2014;which I do not understand: &#x26; I have written to them, that if they should like to wait, I could come to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in Autumn, &#x26; talk with them about the place&#x2014; &#x26; if they should not like to wait,&#x2014;that there would be an end of the matter.&#x2014;and there it stands.&#x2014; I wish you would send me as long a letter as this&#x2014;by this day week&#x2014; I wish also that you would come down &#x26; see me&#x2014;say on a Saturday when the tide is about mid-day, &#x26; then we might cross the water to Skinburness.

<salute>My Dear lad,</salute>
<p>You will easily guess, by the speediness with which I have answered your letter, that I am anxious to be reinstated in your favour. We have indeed written to one another much too seldom, of late. I suppose a good part of the blame is my own&#x2014;but I will not take it all. Let us try to be more regular in future. I was at a loss what to make of the first part of your letter. I could have laughed at the causes which your sagacity has pointed out for the mistake&#x2014;had I not been grieved at the mistake itself. You expect my explanation; but in truth <pb id="pg-01-82" n="01:82"/>I am unable to give any explanation of the matter. I am altogether unconscious of having mentioned any particular Saturday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is right; he didn&#x2019;t. But Mitchell had set out for the trip the previous Saturday, only to be told on the way that it was low tide. He speculated (<date when="1816-07-30">30 July</date>) in a humorously sarcastic manner on the various mathematical errors Carlyle might have made.</note> for our excursion; and had I done so, I cannot conceive, how I should have hit on that day you speak of&#x2014;for I must have known that the tide would not serve. If you have not destroyed that letter, I think you will find in it, that I wished you to come, on the first Saturday that would suit our purpose. But in reality it was late at night, or rather early in the morning before I finished that immense epistle&#x2014;and I dare say I was half asleep over the latter part of it; and so I cannot vouch for its contents. But let us be of comfort. I have looked into the Belfast Town and Country Almanack<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published at Belfast, <date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>.</note>&#x2014;and consulted several cunning men upon the subject&#x2014;and from all quarters, I collect&#x2014; that the moon will be full about one of the clock on the morning of Thursday the 8th inst.&#x2014;so that in all human probability&#x2014;the time of full sea, next Saturday after that, will be between 1 and 2 o&#x2019;clock:&#x2014;a time that will answer our purpose very well. Now if notwithstanding your late disappointment, you could be induced to come to Annan about twelve o&#x2019;clock, that day&#x2014;we could eat a morsel of dinner together and forthwith embark for Cumberland. I am anxious that you should come&#x2014;for I wish to see you; and this will be a pleasant enough way of spending the time; and besides It will do no harm to you&#x2014;it may happen to be of service.&#x2014; Write on Tuesday if you can; and at any rate on Thursday&#x2014;&#x26; let me know if you can come.</p>
<p>With regard to the division of the circle into 360 parts,&#x2014;I think it cannot be done by elementary Geometry&#x2014;at least if M. Gauss<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl Friedrich Gauss (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), a German mathematician, whose work shows that construction of the angle 1&#xB0; by ruler and compass is impossible. Gauss&#x2019;s results, inaccurately described by Carlyle, are discussed in twentieth-century books on the theory of equations.</note> is right&#x2014;who (Leslie tells us) <note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his <hi rend="italic">Elements of Geometry</hi>, 3rd ed. (Edinburgh, <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>).</note>has demonstrated that a polygon can be inscribed in a circle&#x2014;directly&#x2014;by means of circles and straight lines&#x2014;only&#x2014;when the number of its sides is a prime number and can be denoted by 2<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> + 1. This with the exception of the polygons described in the common books of Geometry.&#x2014; Therefore this cannot be done directly. If we attempt to accomplish it by the method explained in Prop. 23.IV&#x2014;I know of no polygons&#x2014;of which, if [<hi rend="italic">if</hi> appears to have <pb id="pg-01-83" n="01:83"/>been crossed out] the number of sides multiplied together will produce 360 [word obscured or 360/2n possibly overwritten] except 12 &#x26; 15 or 30&#x2014;and these require the trisection of an arc;&#x2014;or 18 and 20; and these require the inscription of a nine sided polygon&#x2014;which cannot be done by any known method of plane Geometry.&#x2014; To artists this is of little consequence&#x2014; Indeed Delambre tells us that many of them have adopted a different plan of division. He say<supplied>[s]</supplied>&#x2014;&#x2018;<foreign>Pour diviser par de bisections continuelles, des artistes c&#xE9;l&#xE8;bres ont trouv&#xE9; plus commode de partager le quart d<supplied>[u]</supplied> circle en 96 parties qui, par bisection donnent les arcs de 48, 24, 12, 6, 3. L'arc d<supplied>[e]</supplied> 60&#xB0; vaut 64 parties et donne 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1; ce degr&#xE9; vaut 15/16 = 0.9375 = 0DEG-56'-15"; il se sousdivis&#xE9; en quatre parties de 14'-3".75, et chachun de ces parties e<supplied>[n]</supplied> 16, q<supplied>[ui]</supplied> valent 52"·734375</foreign>.&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;To divide by continual bisection, celebrated artists have found it more convenient to divide a quarter of the circle into 96 parts, which by bisection give the arcs of 48, 24, 12, 6, 3. The arc of 60DEG equals 64 parts and gives 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1; this degree is worth 15/16 = 0.9375 = 0DEG-56'-15"; it is subdivided into four parts of 14'-3".75, and each of these parts into 16 which equal 52".734375.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; In your second difficulty<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first was Mitchell&#x2019;s request to be told how to divide a circle into 360DEG. The second was his objection to the statement that a ship steered due east or west will have a course on the equator or a parallel latitude. RM says it must trace a spiral and gives his reason. According to Mr. Joseph M. Thomas, a ship on fixed course does indeed always trace a spiral, possibly degenerate. The point is that if the course is due east or due west, the spiral has zero inclination and is in a circle; if the course is due north or due south, the spiral has 90DEG inclination and again is in a circle.</note> I am not without hopes of being able to shew you a flaw in your reasoning&#x2014;not doubting that you are very open to conviction. It appears, that in your speculations about this spiral, you forget that the ship&#x2019;s track is perpendicular to any<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle first wrote <hi rend="italic">both of</hi>, which is blotted in the MS.</note> two meridians&#x2014;and therefore that one has no mor<supplied>[e]</supplied> right to be called the hypotenuse than the other. reflect upon the circle and all perpendicular radii: consider that if the plane of the ship&#x2019;s path (for since it is always directed to one point&#x2014;it lies all in one plane) were produced to meet the earth&#x2019;s axis&#x2014;being by hypothesis perpendicular to every meridian, it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be perpendicular to their common intersection. And in that case how can it avoid being paralell to the equator&#x2014; which is also perpendicular to the same straight line? Your reasoning indeed applies to the equator as well as to any paralell circle. But you are <pb id="pg-01-84" n="01:84"/>sufficiently convinced by this time, I am well aware:&#x2014;and therefore I make no more remarks upon the subject.</p>
<p>I am very glad that you have met with a book of natural philosophy that you like.&#x2014; Send me your demonstration (or bring it) of the accelerated motion.&#x2014; I return always to the study of Physics with more pleasure&#x2014;after trying &#x2018;The Philosophy of Mind.&#x2019;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell was reading either <hi rend="italic">Elements of the Philosophy of Mind</hi> (London, <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>), by Thomas Belsham (<date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>); or <hi rend="italic">Essays in Philosophical Morality</hi>, 2 vols.

Let me study his writings as I like&#x2014;my mind seems only to turn on its axis&#x2014;but without progressive or retrograde motion at all. <supplied>[Dur]</supplied>ing these eighteen months, for example, have I been at times, labouring to comprehend the difference between the <hi rend="italic">primary</hi> &#x26; <hi rend="italic">secondary qualities</hi> of <supplied>[bodies, and m]</supplied>y labour has always been in vain.&#x2014; Can you resolve me, thi<supplied>[s dif]</supplied>ficulty? I can easily see that <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> (a secondary quality) has two meanings&#x2014;either it means the sensation in our mind&#x2014;or it means the disposition of the particles of the body&#x2014;that causes this sensation: but is not hardness (&#x26; th<supplied>[e]</supplied> other primary qualities) in the same predicament?</p>
<p>I designed to say many other things&#x2014;but Post John is about to set out&#x2014;and I must hold my hand.

<salute>My Dear <supplied>[Mitchell]</supplied></salute>
<p>I shall set out for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to-morrow morning; and before going, I have begun (as in duty bound) to give you an account of my procedure.&#x2014; I have done nothing at all since I saw you, but put off my time. I was sick two or three days; and went over to Allonby to recreate myself. I returned from Allonby in three days&#x2014;and remained mostly at home&#x2014;waiting with patience for the day of my departure&#x2014;which at length is near at hand&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am glad you get on so well with your Mathematics. Your demonstration of that theorem of West&#x2014;about the triangle&#x2014;which you sent me&#x2014;is simple &#x26; neat&#x2014;much better than mine, as far as I can recollect. &#x2018;Samuel Cowan Land-Surveyor&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See RM to TC, <date when="1817-01-06">6 Jan. 1817</date>. Cowan seems to have been an unknown correspondent with whom RM exchanged problems, not a friend (RM says that he is &#x201C;unknown to me&#x201D;). He was certainly a correspondent in the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>. See also <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170212-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1817-02-12">12 Feb. 1817</date></ref>.</note> seems not to be such a dull person&#x2014;as from the confused dropping of perpendiculars, drawing of lines &#x26;c with which he made his first appearance, I had conjectured that he was. I tried his problem, but was able to make out only a very bad solution. I will not trouble you with it at this time. I did not see the &#x2018;Courier&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, founded by Henry Duncan (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>). The first issue appeared on <date when="1809-12-06">6 Dec. 1809</date>.</note> last week; but I suppose there was nothing in it, that I do not know about. I have got nothing to send you&#x2014;of any use&#x2014;unless you think of inserting the following problem; which notwithstanding the technical jargon, in which it is enveloped&#x2014;is after all a silly enough piece of work. You will perceive that it is a general solution of the problem, concerning a particular case of which Mr White was so facetious, above two years ago. It is [MS torn] the only thing I have done, since I saw you: and as I now write it out <supplied>[for the fi]</supplied>rst time, I am not without apprehensions of errors in the computation <supplied>[tho&#x2019; sure]</supplied> enough of the principle. But if you propose it&#x2014;I shall have time <supplied>[enough to]</supplied> give it a revisal before a solution is required.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">To determine the nature of the curves; extending between the opposite corners of a given rectangle (each having one of the sides for its axis), that shall divide it into any given number</hi> (n) <hi rend="italic">of equal portions</hi>.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-86" n="01:86"/>Since the rectangle and the number, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> are given, it is plain, that the area contained by each curve must be a given part of the rectangle under its absciss &#x26; ordinate<supplied>[.]</supplied> The problem, therefore includes this&#x2014;To find the equation of the curve, the area of which is given. Let x represent the absciss &#x26; y the ordinate, <figure><graphic url="a1.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure> being a given proper fraction.</p>
<p>Then <figure><graphic url="a2.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure> = the fluxion of the area = flux. <figure><graphic url="a3.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure>.</p>
 <p>Therefore <figure><graphic url="a4.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure>. From which it appears that x is a simple function of y, or that some multiple or submultiple of x is equal to one of the pow<supplied>[ers]</supplied> of y. Since x and y are of the same dimensions, put <figure><graphic url="a5.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure>, or <figure><graphic url="a6.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure> and substituting this value of x in the former equation, <figure><graphic url="a7.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure>. Consequently <figure><graphic url="a8.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure>, and <figure><graphic url="a9.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure> : and the equation of the curve, the area of which is <figure><graphic url="a10.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure>, or <figure><graphic url="a11.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure>.</p>
 <p>Now it is evident that if a curve be described having the base of the rectangle for its absciss &#x26; the altitude for its ordinate, and containing an area equal to the <figure><graphic url="a12.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure>th part of the rectangle it will leave <figure><graphic url="a13.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure> [of the rectangle] on its convex side; and [illegible] equation (according to the general formula [illegible] be <figure><graphic url="a14.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure>. Again if another curve having the same absciss x [illegible] containing the [illegible] <figure><graphic url="a15.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure> part of the rectangle&#x2014;it will cut off [illegible] <figure><graphic url="a13.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure> of the rectangle; and its equation, as before, will be a [illegible.] Let the division be continued till the number of curves described is the g<supplied>[reatest]</supplied> integer in <figure><graphic url="a16.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure> ; and if the same operations be repeated on the other side of the diagonal&#x2014;there will remain at last a space inculded between the opposite interior curves, a space equal to the n &#x2014;&#x2014;.</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;But here is Johnson with intelligence that my intended <foreign><hi rend="italic">comp<supplied>[a]</supplied>gnon de voyage</hi></foreign> cannot go to-morrow; and I must off in the <pb id="pg-01-87" n="01:87"/>Coach to-night at six o&#x2019;clock&#x2014; &#x2018;Night thickens&#x2014;&#x26; the crow makes wing to the rooky wood.&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, III, ii.</note> I have not a moment to lose&#x2014; Good b'ye my Dear Mitchell&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dear Friend</salute>
 <p>I have no doubt that you sometimes think of me, and feel some degree of impatience to know what I am doing<supplied>[.]</supplied> I am about to satisfy your anxieties, by giving you an account of my adventures since I left Ecclefechan.&#x2014; You will remember that it was a vile raw night when I parted from you, and you will easily conceive that my journey to Moffat was none of the most agreeable. The next day was considerably worse on the top of Ericstane the wind blew loudly, and drove the hail against us, with considerable violence. You will figure my situation, when I tell you that I was perched on the roof of the &#x2018;leathern conveniency&#x2019; and that the interior contained a full cargo of Dumfries lawyers. To complete my chagrin, a few minutes after we had passed the glen, my hat was blown off. The coach halted: I looked at the Guard, but all the faculties of his soul seemed &#x2018;screwed to the sticking place&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, I, vii.</note>&#x2014;to devise means to keep himself in heat, and, unwilling to disturb him, I alighted myself and plunged heedlessly into a snowwreath&#x2014;for which I had the mortification of sitting all day, with my feet and legs at the freezing point of water. When I arrived at Edinburgh I found my friends in a state of considerable fermentation <supplied>[our]</supplied> ancient landlord and many of his kidney were crying vehemently for parliamentary reform, and chanting the praises of Major Cartwright,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Cartwright (<date when="1740-00-00">1740</date>&#x2013;<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>), a political reformer who served for a time in the navy and in the militia, wrote in favor of strengthening the navy, reforming Parliament, abolishing slavery, emancipating Greece, and crushing absolutism in Spain. He began in <date when="1780-00-00">1780</date> the agitation which earned him the title &#x201C;Father of Reform.&#x201D; He was frequently in correspondence with Edmund Burke and other leaders of opinion. See <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4817"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>.</note> and the Hampden-Club. The students on the contrary were deeply immersed in natural Philosophy<supplied>[.]</supplied> Mr. Leslie had begun to <pb id="pg-01-88" n="01:88"/>lecture in place of Mr. Playfair,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Professor John Playfair, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170212-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1817-02-12">12 Feb. 1817</date></ref>.</note> and many were gathered to hear him: after which, they would descant, with much Zeal and very little knowledge, upon Anaxagoras and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">vis insita</hi></foreign> [innate force] of matter. I did not enter keenly into either of the speculations; but wandered about amongst my acquaintance, whilst I remained. I saw Campbell of Ruthwell&#x2014;he seemed well and contented. I met also with Clack and Milroy and Irving and many others. Laurie I saw likewise he looks still very weak, tho&#x2019; I am told he is recovering. Murray was not in Edin' but he was expected, I went with Waugh on the morning of the Eclipse of the sun,&#x2014;to the top of the Calton.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An eclipse of the sun visible from Edinburgh occurred on <date when="1816-11-19">19 Nov.</date> from 7:51 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi> to 10:07 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi> There was an observatory on Calton Hill.</note> But alas! tho&#x2019; the eclipse has been predicted in the Belfast Almanack, tho&#x2019; many a fair Lady exposed her tender frame to the unwholesome dews of morning and tho&#x2019; many a gallant youth attended with smoked glass&#x2014;to exhibit before his Dulcinea the extent of his astronomical acquirements&#x2014;no man saw it nor woman either, the morning was cloudy&#x2014;it even rained. I attended the first meeting of the Philalethic society&#x2014; There were many new members, but the society seemed to have undergone no improvement. Jamie Thomson still speaks with his former pertinacity. Andrew made a harangue as vapid as ever, Thomas Irving<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is difficult to be sure of the identification of these fellow students of Carlyle. Murray, however, is Thomas Murray (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18130624-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1813-06-24">24 June 1813</date></ref>).

Membership was limited to twenty-five, plus extraordinary members, and meetings took place weekly, on Saturday nights, for reading of essays and discussion of all topics except those &#x201C;of an abstruse, theological, or political nature.&#x201D; Members had to have been at Edinburgh University for at least two years.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I yesterday received a letter from our friend Johnston, who tells me, that you are greatly astonished at my long silence. And in truth you have some reason; but you are wide of the mark, in the hypothesis which you have formed to account for the phenomenon. I am certainly much dissatisfied with your conduct; but this could only have induced me to write with greater vehemence and celerity. The truth is, I began you a letter about three weeks after my arrival in this place, and had proceeded a great way&#x2014;when some stupid business or other interrupted me&#x2014;and the paper was thrown by for ten days. I began another with renovated zeal, and had actually got to the last page, when your letter from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> arrived&#x2014;and struck me dumb with grief &#x26; surprise. I was in a sad taking. To think, that my very last employment before leaving home was writing to you&#x2014;that I had calculated the weeks and days that must elapse, before the month of <date when="1817-03-00">March</date> could bring us together to hold a solemn conference touching all that should concern us;&#x2014;and then to hear in the midst of my calculations, that tho&#x2019; during a fortnight you were with<supplied>[in]</supplied> ten miles of me&#x2014;that tho&#x2019; in two hours from any given point of time you might have been transported to my habitation&#x2014;you came not near me!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See RM to TC, <date when="1817-01-06">6 Jan.</date> [Mitchell writes <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date> by mistake but his letter is postmarked.] &#x201C;Moreover I am not coming to see you<supplied>[;]</supplied> in Defense of this resolution I might cite Horatius Flaccus &#x26; a hundred others who expatiate on the dangers of the stormy deep&#x2014;but in good truth I have not time. &#x2026;&#x201D; He goes on to apologize for forgetting Carlyle&#x2019;s books and to scold him for not writing, ending &#x201C;seriously, I am very angry&#x2014;but what does it avail&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> It was a dog&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-01-90" n="01:90"/>trick Mitchell. Little prevented me from throwing down my implements, and crossing the salt sea to seek you&#x2014;had I known to what corner of the great city my search must be directed. All that remained for me then, was, by writing a most abusive letter, to shew you how much &#x2018;the galled jade will wince.&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, ii.</note> But alas! no sooner had I collected my energies for this entreprise than a sore-throat seized me&#x2014;and (after a protracted struggle on my part) confined me nearly a whole week to my room. My heart died within me at the sight of the gargles &#x26; boluses &#x26; blisters with which I was assailed: and till two days ago, I was able to think of nothing but the sickness &#x26; sorrow to which mortal man is subject in this miserable planet.&#x2014; This is the reason of my silence. You will perceive that the blame rest<supplied>[s]</supplied> with you &#x26; fortune<supplied>[.]</supplied> I am faultless&#x2014;or nearly so. Still I am in a very considerable rage against you. Whether &#x2018;mine anger shall abate&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Judg. 8:3: &#x201C;Their anger was abated toward him.&#x201D;</note> upon consideration of a long letter speedily sent me, I know not&#x2014;but I wish you would make the experiment.</p>
<p>Johnson will have told you all about my condition and operations in this long and dirty town; and it would but fatigue you to repeat the statement. I am sufficiently comfortable; and feel considerably less spleen &#x26; ennui than I used to do at Annan. My habits have been so much deranged by change of place, that I have not yet got rightly settled to my studies. I have read little since I saw you: and of that little, I doubt, I have not made the best use. Have you seen Playfairs introductory essay in the Encyclopedia?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Playfair (<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>&#x2013;<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>), &#x201C;Dissertation Second: Exhibiting a General View of the Progress of Mathematical and Physical Science,&#x201D; in Supplement to 4th, 5th, and 6th eds. of <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi>.</note> I am sure you will like it. It is distinguished for its elegance &#x26; perspicuity. I perused it some weeks ago, and thought it greatly preferable to Stewarts. Indeed I have often told you, that I am somewhat displeased with myself because I cannot admire this great philosopher, half as much as many critics do. He is so very stately&#x2014;so transcendental&#x2014;and withal so unintelligible, that I cannot look upon him with the needful veneration. I was reading the second volume of his &#x2018;Philosophy of the human mind,&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dugald Stewart, <hi rend="italic">Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind</hi>, 2 vols. (Edinburgh and London, <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>).</note> lately. It is principally devoted to the consideration of Reason. The greater part of the book is taken up with statements of the opinions of others; and it often required all my penetration to discover <pb id="pg-01-91" n="01:91"/>what the Author&#x2019;s own views of the matter were. He talks much about Analysis &#x26; Mathematics, and disports him very pleasantly upon geometrical reasoning; but leaves what is to me the principal difficulty, untouched. Tell me if you have read it. You have no doubt seen the &#x2018;Tales of my Landlord.&#x2019; Certainly Waverl<supplied>[e]</supplied>y and Mannering and the Black Dwarf were never written by the same person.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Black Dwarf</hi> is part of <hi rend="italic">Tales of My Landlord</hi>, published under the pseudonym of Jedediah Cleishbottom, 4 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>). These and <hi rend="italic">Waverley</hi> (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Guy Mannering</hi> (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>) are all by Sir Walter Scott.</note> If I mistake not&#x2014;Dr M'Crie&#x2019;s strictures<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Dr. Thomas M'Crie&#x2019;s &#x201C;Vindication of the Covenanters&#x201D; (a review of <hi rend="italic">Tales of My Landlord</hi>), <hi rend="italic">Christian Instructor</hi>, <date when="1817-01-00">Jan.</date> and <date when="1817-02-00">Feb. 1817</date>.</note> are a little too severe, on some occassions&#x2014;and his love of the Cameronians<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A religious sect of Reformed Presbyterians founded by Richard Cameron (d. <date when="1680-00-00">1680</date>), Scottish Covenanter.</note> too violent. The Worthy Doctor&#x2019;s humour is as heavy as lead&#x2014; I am afraid you are tired of this&#x2014;</p>
<p>It is very comfortable that you and Samuel Cowan go on so lovingly together. I am unacquainted with your lucubrations; for I have not seen a &#x2018;Courier&#x2019; since I left Dumfriesshire. Long ago when I was in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I had demonstrated a theorem for your behoof&#x2014;but I have nearly forgot it now. I think it may be enunciated thus. &#x2018;If the diameter of a circle be divided internally &#x26; externally in the same ratio, the straight lines drawn from one of the points of section to the extremities of the chord passing thro&#x2019; the other, will make equal angles with that diameter.&#x2019; It bears some analogy to one of Matthew Stewart&#x2019;s. You will get the demonstration well enough.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170705-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1817-07-05">5 July 1817</date></ref>. On <date when="1816-10-08">8 Oct. 1816</date> the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> had announced that it was beginning a new series of mathematical problems like the one begun two years before and dropped for lack of space. Problems were to be submitted accompanied by a solution which would be printed two weeks later if no better one had been received. Theorems and solutions appeared with fair regularity in odd corners of the paper, but often a note appeared postponing them for the time being. It seems highly probable that Mitchell acted as editor for these problems. Someone with the pseudonym &#x201C;Alpha&#x201D; sent a problem in on <date when="1816-10-15">15 Oct.</date> On <date when="1816-12-03">3 Dec.</date> the solution to a problem is signed &#x201C;S. Cowan.&#x201D; On <date when="1817-01-06">6 Jan.</date> Mitchell in a letter to Carlyle spoke of the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> as &#x201C;our newspaper&#x201D; and said, &#x201C;Samuel Cowan Land surveyor and myself go on lovingly together. &#x2026; Alpha has proposed to be given in next week, &#x2018;To divide a straight line harmonically so as to have its extreme segments in a given ratio.&#x2019;&#x201D; Alpha&#x2019;s solution appeared in the issue of <date when="1817-02-03">3 Feb.</date> Along with Cowan and Alpha, Carlyle must have been a contributor at this time, although one problem suggested by him seems not to have appeared (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18161113-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1816-11-13">13 Nov. 1816</date>)</ref></note> Johnson tells me that Mr Duncan has engaged a certain M'Darmaid<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M'Diarmid. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1821-01-10">10 Jan. 1821</date></ref>. M'Diarmid actually was the co-editor of the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> as well as editor of the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>.</note> to assist him in conducting <pb id="pg-01-92" n="01:92"/>the paper. I think I have heard of this person&#x2019;s speeches in the forum&#x2014;and also that his wit was very great. I hope in his hand the torch of eloquence will burn bright&#x2014;and shed a strong ray of intellectual light over the whole district.</p>
<p>I have not been in Edinburgh since you left it; and therefore, I can give little news from that quarter. Your countryman Frank Dixon<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Dickson. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230524-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1823-05-24">24 May 1823</date></ref>.</note> came into the town a few days ago; and I believe he intends to remain, if he can obtain employment. He was in this place last week visiting Edward Irving.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>) went to Edinburgh University in <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>, graduated <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>. From <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date> to <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date> he taught at Haddington where he first met and tutored Jane Baillie Welsh. He then taught at Kirkcaldy and met Isabella Martin, whom he subsequently married in <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>. Carlyle and Irving became friendly when Carlyle arrived in <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date> to teach in a rival school. From <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date> to <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> Irving was Dr. Chalmers&#x2019; assistant at St. John&#x2019;s, Glasgow. But in <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> he moved to London to Hatton Garden Chapel and there he became a fashionable and popular preacher. His popularity did not remain constant, and after he had moved to a new and larger church in Regent Square his congregation gradually dwindled. In <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date> he made a highly successful preaching tour of Scotland, but his insistence on various heretical doctrines led to his being censured by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and expelled by the Presbytery of Annan in <date when="1833-03-00">March 1833</date>. He was the son of Gavin Irving and had four brothers, George, John, and two others. See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> and the <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14473"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>.</note> He is a fellow of infinite jest:<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, V, i.</note> and spares no pains to keep his company in convulsions.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have long been intending to write you a line or two in order to let you know my state &#x26; condition&#x2014;but having nothing worth writing to communicate, I have put it off from time to time. I need not say how much I was rejoiced to hear of your complete recovery; there was little enjoyment for any person at Mainhill when I was there last <pb id="pg-01-94" n="01:94"/>year; but I look forward to the ensuing autumn when I hope to have the happiness of discussing matters with you as we were wont to do of old. It gives me pleasure to hear that the <foreign><hi rend="italic">bairns</hi></foreign> are at school. There are few things in this world more valuable than knowledge&#x2014;and youth is the period for acquiring it. With the exception of the religious and moral instruction which I had the happiness of receiving from my parents&#x2014;and which I humbly trust will not be entirely lost upon me&#x2014;there is nothing for which I feel more grateful than for the education which they have bestowed upon me. Sandy was getting fond of reading when he went away, I hope he and Aiken<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Aitken Carlyle, his younger brother (<date when="1801-07-07">7 July 1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-09-15">15 Sept. 1879</date>), later M.D., and translator from the French and Italian.</note> will continue their operations now that he is home. There cannot be imagined a more honest way of employing spare hours.</p>
<p>My way of life in this place is much the same as formerly. The school is doing pretty well; and my health through the winter has been uniformly good. I have little intercourse with the natives here; yet there is no dryness between us&#x2014;we are always happy to meet &#x26; happy to part. But their society is not very valuable to me&#x2014;and my books are friends that never fail me. I sometimes see the minister &#x26; some others of them, with whom I am very well satisfied; &#x26; Irving<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170212-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1817-02-12">12 Feb.</date></ref></note> &#x26; I are very friendly&#x2014;as well as Pears<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Pears. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221113-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1822-11-13">13 Nov. 1822</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;so I am never wearied or at a loss to pass the time. We had Bob of the Bank<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Irving. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220427-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1822-04-27">27 Apr. 1822</date></ref>.</note> here some weeks ago giving us an account of all the people in your neighbourhood. They do not seem to be in a very flourishing condition, I think, for most part.</p>
<p>You will have heard of the miserable end of poor William Irving&#x2014; Johnnie&#x2019;s son.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also <ref target="volume-01/lt-18180728-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1818-07-28">28 July 1818</date></ref>.</note> It appears that his wife &#x26; he had been compelled to separate on account of poverty&#x2014;and that she had engaged herself as a nurse in some family in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. He had been meditating suicide for a considerable time&#x2014;and, having been refused admittance one day when he went to see his wife, he swallowed a large quantity of laudanum upon his return home. But either he had been seized with remorse or some one had detected his situation, and a physician by means of a strong emetic rid him of the poisonous drug. However the same evening in the room I suppose where his children were sleeping, he tied a string round his neck and having opened the vein beneath his ear <pb id="pg-01-95" n="01:95"/>(anatomists call it the jugular vein)&#x2014;he completed the desperate act which his mind had been it appears, sometime revolving. I was struck with horror to hear of his fate. He was a man of some considerable talents&#x2014;and had his mind been directed by prudence (of which he was nearly destitute) and by religious or moral feelings&#x2014;which in his wandering unhappy way of life had become greatly obscured in him&#x2014;he might have lived to be a credit to his friends&#x2014;and the country which produced him. Some days before his death he wrote a letter, which was found in his pocket, to Mr Gray teacher in the High-school<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Gray, M.A. (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), shoemaker turned teacher, knew Burns and taught his sons. he taught at the Edinburgh High School from <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date> to <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> aned was principal teacher of Greek there from <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date> to <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>.

<p>I had designed this night to write to Aiken, about his books and studies, but I will scarcely have time to say any thing.

<salute>My Dear Mitchell,</salute>
<p>Certainly your letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1817-02-23">23 Feb.</date></note> ought to have been answered before this. But it seems to be the fate of all my lucubrations to be behind their time. I have no excuse to offer&#x2014;except of course no time &#x26; no subject&#x2014;and I need not aggravate my offence by taking up your time longer with discussing it. If you shall be graciously pleased to pardon me, I promise to behave in future as becometh me.&#x2014; I have nothing surprising to tell you. I myself am leading a quiet and peaceable life: and my neighbours, like every other person&#x2019;s neighbours, are exclaiming against the hardness of the times, and praising or blaming the proceedings of the Government&#x2014;according as the late &#x2018;strengthening of the hands of the Executive&#x2019; happens to strike their mental optics.&#x2014; We had two lectures upon the pathognomy of Drs Gall &#x26; Spurzhiem<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell had written: &#x201C;We had a visit of Dr Spurzheim here, on his way to London and George Ross was with some difficulty persuaded to meet him here&#x2014; In fact, George had some reason to be afraid as he was quite certain that the Doctor would pocket his skull altogether&#x2014; The head of course was just what was expected, at least we were told so&#x2014; Whatever may be thought of the theory in general it has certainly been pushed too far&#x2014; Spurzheim is very pleasant &#x26; unassuming in his manners, illustrates his positions with astonishing clearness and vivacity and is generally allowed to be a good anatomist&#x2014; He has made a considerable number of proselytes in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and among these a due proportion of Ladies.&#x201D;</note> lately. The cranioscopist was a Mr Allen<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200519-TC-MAL-01">TC to <sic>MA</sic><corr>MAL</corr>, <date when="1820-05-19">19 May 1820</date></ref>.

He seems to pos<supplied>[s]</supplied>ess talents&#x2014;but to be very much addicted to building hypotheses. On this occassion, he had the honour of addressing all that was rich &#x26; fair &#x26; learned in the burgh. After considerable flourishing he ventured to produce this child of the Dr&#x2019;s brain&#x2014;and truly it seemed a very Sooterkin<supplied>[.]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Norton, <hi rend="italic">EL</hi>, p. 46, quotes this note signed by Carlyle: &#x201C;It is reported of the Dutch women that making so great a use of stoves, and often putting them under their petticoats, they engender a kind of ugly monster which is called <hi rend="italic">sooterkin</hi>.&#x2019; Note to <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi>, III, ii, 146.&#x201D; See also <hi rend="italic">OED</hi>.</note> I have since looked into the Dr&#x2019;s book, and if possible the case is worse. Certainly, it is not true, that, our intellectual &#x26; moral &#x26; physical powers are jumbled <pb id="pg-01-97" n="01:97"/>in such huge disorder&#x2014;surely it will be marvellous if these powers can be defined and estimated with such Mathematical precision, from the size &#x26; figure of the scull; but it is very silly to say that Spurzhiem has <hi rend="italic">demonstrated</hi> all this&#x2014; Spurzhiem has demonstrated nothing;&#x2014;for any thing he knows to the contrary, the faculties of the soul are to be ascertained from the figure &#x26; size of the abdomen&#x2014;if the venerable science of palmistry is not to be revived&#x2014; It is in vain to rail against the opposition shewn to novelties&#x2014;the doctrine is not to be rejected for its novelty, but for its want of truth&#x2014; Neither does it serve any purpose to tell us of the many ingenious persons who support it. A century has not elapsed since Dr Berkely wrote a book on the virtues of Tar-water<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Berkeley (<date when="1685-00-00">1685</date>&#x2013;<date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>), A <hi rend="italic">Chain of Philosophical Reflections and Inquiries concerning the Virtues of Tar-Water</hi> (London, <date when="1744-00-00">1744</date>).</note>&#x2014;and the learned in Europe were loud in itspraise: yet now Tar-water is accounted vile&#x2014; So it may fare with Spurzhiem. Nevertheless Allen has converted the lieges of Kirkcaldy. So strong is the desire which we all feel of knowing the character talents &#x26; disposition of our neighbour, and so deep is the regret, that,</p>

<l>To publish what he does within doors &#x26;c&#x2019;&#x2014;</l></lg>
<p>That craniology (&#x2014;to say nothing of other inducements) if urged with a proper quantity of dogmatism, will find many b<supplied>[e]</supplied>lievers. And why not? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur</hi></foreign>.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;If a people wishes to be deceived, let it be.&#x201D; The full quotation is: &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Quando equidem populus iste vult decipi, decipiatur</hi></foreign>&#x201D; (Cardinal Carafa [Pope Paul IV], <hi rend="italic">De Thou, Historiae sui Temporis</hi> [<date when="1609-00-00">1609</date> ed.], XVII, 356).</note></p>
 <p>I was in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> two weeks ago: but there was nothing worthy of Notice taking place. I heard Leslie give a lecture on heat:&#x2014;it displayed great ingenuity, but his experiments did not succeed.&#x2014; His geometry is to be out in a few days.&#x2014; I intended to have enrolled in the Divinity-Hall; but their Doctor<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. William Ritchie (<hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> <date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), minister of St. Giles, professor of divinity at Edinburgh University (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;28).</note> was too busily engaged otherwise to attend to me. He had been quarrelling with his students about the management of the library; and the committee, which had been appointed to draw up regulations for the management of it, had that very day submitted them to the Doctor &#x26; his students assembled in the Hall. They gave much dissatisfaction to the Doctor, and immediately (as I was told&#x2014;for I was not there) there was great confusion, and several speeches vituperative &#x26; objurgatory passed among them; till at last the mutineers to the number of fifty, adjourned to a neighbouring school-room, <pb id="pg-01-98" n="01:98"/><foreign><hi rend="italic">con strepito</hi></foreign> [noisily]&#x2014;and valiantly drew up twelve resolutions proclaiming their grievances, &#x26; their determination to apply to the presbytery for advice. The Senatus Academicus has since taken up the case; and, as the committee appointed to decide on it consists of Meiklejohn, Ritchie &#x26; Brunton, it is easy to see how the affair will end.&#x2014; Your picture of this hall &#x26; the dudgeon it seems to have excited in you gave me great amusement. I have not been within its walls for many months&#x2014;&#x26; I know not whether I shall ever return, but all accounts agree in representing it as one of the most melancholy &#x26; unprofitable corporations, that has appeared in these parts for a great while. If we are to judge of the kind of Professors we should get from the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Kirk, by the sample we already pos<supplied>[s]</supplied>ess, it is devou<supplied>[t]</supplied>ly to be wished that their visits may be short &#x26; far between.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, i; <ref target="volume-01/lt-18181106-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1818-11-06">6 Nov. 1818</date></ref>.</note> It may safely be asserted that tho&#x2019; the Doctors Ritchie junior &#x26; senior, with Dr Meiklejohn, Dr Brunton &#x26; Dr Brown<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hugh Meiklejohn (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), professor of church history (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>) at Edinburgh University, and minister of Abercorn; Alexander Brunton (<date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date><corr>; <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3781/3779"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref></corr>), minister and professor of oriental languages, Edinburgh University; Thomas Brown (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date><corr>; <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3655"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref></corr>), metaphysician, disciple of Dugald Stewart. <sic>See <hi rend="italic">DNB</hi> for Brunton and Brown.</sic></note> were to continue in their chairs, dosing in their present fashion, for a century, all the knowledge which they could discover, would be an imperceptible quantity&#x2014;if indeed it<supplied>[s]</supplied> sign were not negative. We ought to be somewhat sorry for the divinity-Hall; but our grief need not stop here. If we follow its members into the world, and observe their destination, we shall find it very pitiful. With the exception of the few whom superior talents or better stars exempted from the common fortune, every Scotch Licenciate<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Preacher who having been examined by a church presbytery had been pronounced fit to preach and undertake parochial duties and was therefore qualified for presentation to a parish as a minister.</note> must adopt one of two alternatives. If he is made of pliant stuff, he selects some one having authority before whom he bows with unabating alacrity for (say) ha<supplied>[l]</supplied>f-a-score of years, and thereby obtains a Kirk: whereupon he betakes him to collect his stipend, and (unless he think of persecuting the Schoolmaster) generally in a few months, falls into a state of torpor, from which he rises no more. If on the other hand, the soul of the Licenc<supplied>[i]</supplied>ate is stubborn &#x26; delights not to honour the Esquires of the district,&#x2014;heartless &#x26; hopeless he must drag out his life&#x2014;without aim or object&#x2014;vexed at every step to see surplices alighting on the backs of many who surpass him in nothing&#x2014; <pb id="pg-01-99" n="01:99"/>but their <hi rend="italic">love for gravy</hi>.&#x2a;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2a;I would advise every young man (says Dr Goldsmith) at his entrance into the world, <hi rend="italic">to like gravy</hi>: I was once disinherited by an old Uncle for not liking gravy&#x2014;(from memory&#x2014;).&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note.) Lay patronage, which was divided between private patrons (about 50 per cent), the Crown (about 32 per cent), and Town Councils, had been restored in <date when="1718-00-00">1718</date> by a pro-Jacobite government despite opposition from the General Assembly. Throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries opposition to patronage continued and spasmodic secessions from the Established Church by various groups took place. Carlyle&#x2019;s parents belonged to one such congregation in Ecclefechan. The culmination of this dispute came with the &#x201C;Disruption,&#x201D; in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, when the Evangelical party left the Established Church in a body to set up the Free Church. The division in the Church was between the Moderates, who thought the Church should keep within its strictly defined legal limits, and the Evangelicals, who believed that the state had no right to interfere within the Church&#x2019;s spiritual field. The real controversy was over the difficulty of defining the spiritual field. As the Court of Session upheld the Moderate, or conservative, viewpoint and defined the spiritual field narrowly, the Evangelicals felt forced to leave the Established Church.</note> This is the result of patronage, and this is one of the stages thro&#x2019; which every established church must pass, in its road to dissolution. No Government ever fostered a Church&#x2014;unless for its value as a state-engine,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Patronage as a &#x201C;state engine&#x201D; refers to the contemporary practice of using Crown patronage as an instrument of politics to elect a Tory or, at least, a politically innocuous clergyman.</note> and none was ever ignorant of the insecurity of this engine, till it is placed upon the rock of patronage. But it ends not here. Tho all &#x2018;constituted authorities&#x2019; are ready to admit, that, Truth is great and will prevail&#x2014;none have ventured to let their &#x2018;true religion&#x2019; descend unsupported into the arena, and try its hand at mauling the heresies which oppose it. On the contrary every &#x2018;true religion&#x2019; is propped &#x26; bolstered, &#x26; the hands of its rivals tied up; till by nursing and fattening it has become a bloated monster that human nature can no longer look upon&#x2014;and men rise up &#x26; knock its brains out. Then there is great joy for a season; and forthwith a successor is elected, which undergoes the same treatment&#x2014;and in process of time, meets with a similar fate. Such is the destiny of Churches by law established. Let every one of us be as contented with it as possible&#x2014;and gird up his loins to attain unto a share of the plate whilst the game is good&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am glad that you like Adam Smith.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1723-00-00">1723</date>&#x2013;90), <hi rend="italic">The Wealth of Nations</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>).</note> I agree with you very cordially and regard him as one of the most honest &#x26; ingenious men of his age&#x2014;or indeed of any other. He is one of the very few writers, who have not gone delirious when they came to treat of Metaphysics. He wrote his wealth of Nations in a room not a hundred yards from the <pb id="pg-01-100" n="01:100"/>place where I am sitting&#x2014;and the men of Kirkcaldy are, with reason, proud to remember him.&#x2014; You view L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Bacon

It looks as if philosophers could not do without some one to worship. It is not long since they tumbled poor Aristotle from his temple&#x2014;and it rests not with Playfair &#x26; Stewart or Bacon would soon be exalted in his stead.&#x2014; I have read little of any consequence since I wrote to you. You will have seen the last Numbers of the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; Quarterly reviews. In the latter, among a great deal of foul &#x26; nauseating stuff, I was happy to see that due credit is at length given to Mr Duncan for his valuable institution.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rev. Henry Duncan had established at Ruthwell &#x201C;a Parish Bank for the Savings of the Industrious,&#x201D; what Norton calls &#x201C;the parent of all modern Savings Banks.&#x201D; Duncan published an account of this in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>, XVI (<date when="1816-10-00">Oct. 1816</date>), 89&#x2013;116 (<hi rend="italic">EL</hi>, p. 49 n.).</note> I was reading Pascal&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">lettres provinciales</hi>.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blaise Pascal (<date when="1623-00-00">1623</date>&#x2013;<date when="1662-00-00">62</date>), <hi rend="italic">Les Provinciales, ou les letters</hi> (Paris, <date when="1657-00-00">1657</date>).</note> None can help admiring his wit &#x26; probity.

It is pity that the Salvation of Europe required the reestablishment of this vile order of men. Last week I perused von Buch&#x2019;s travels in Norway &#x26; Lapland.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron Christian Leopold von Buch (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), <hi rend="italic">Reise durch Norwegen und Lappland,</hi> trans.

Nevertheless he communicates some valuable information respecting the natural productions&#x2014;&#x26; the wandering inhabitants of those dreary regions. His manner is as clumsy &#x26; ponderous as that of German philosophers generally is&#x2014;and no where is this <supplied>[more ap]</supplied>parent than when he attempts to be striking, or tries his powers in the pathetic lin<supplied>[e.

<salute>My Dear Robin,</salute>
<p>After waiting very impatiently for such a long period, I received with great satisfaction, the short but savoury morsel which thou hast at length been pleased to dispatch me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1817-06-09">9 June</date>. RM wrote: &#x201C;I send this as an avant-courier to propitiate.&#x201D;</note> It does not by any means quell my appetite; but you assure me it is only a precursor, &#x26; what can I do but be &#x2018;propitiated.&#x2019;&#x2014; I turned pale when I noticed your charge of &#x2018;palming&#x2014;&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell had written: &#x201C;Now my good lad how came you to palm upon me or rather who palmed upon you the two Propositions propounded in your last&#x2014; Are they not Props 4 &#x26; 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of Leslies third book of Analysis?&#x201D;</note> The proposition about the harmonic section was, as I said before, included in one of Matthew Stewart&#x2019;s problems<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matthew Stewart (<date when="1717-00-00">1717</date>&#x2013;<date when="1785-00-00">85</date>), the father of Dugald Stewart, wrote <hi rend="italic">Tracts, Physical and Mathematical</hi> (<date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>).</note>&#x2014;the source, I suppose, from which Leslie himself obtained it. NO doubt it was stupid enough not to know that it was deducible from prop. 22. III. of the Analysis or still more directly from prop 9. VI. Elements&#x2014;and therein lies my error. The problem concerning the minimum was proposed last winter in Leslie&#x2019;s class: and I know not when or where or in what manner you &#x26; Waugh had discussed it. That &#x2018;to find the locus of the vertex of a triangle given in species whose base is one of the sides of a given angle standing on a given straight line,&#x2019; was also derived from one of Leslie&#x2019;s. It seems to have no affinity with prop 4. III. Analysis. I suppose it has been wron<supplied>[gly]</supplied> enunciated to you.&#x2014; So that you see the quantity of palming has in this case been very inconsiderable.&#x2014; The same day on which I received your letter, I perused Alpha&#x2019;s Newspaper-solution. Edward Irving thinks it a learned investigation. I think so likewise. The very same result (for I tried it) is obtained, and by nearly a similar process, from the 32<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> prop. of Newton: but I do not understand your integral calculus&#x2014; It would be a more difficult business to find the time of descent to the centre of the earth. I wish you would try this and send me your result&#x2014; I am afraid I can not do it.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, I finished M. Bailly&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">histoire de l'Astronomie Modern</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">e</hi>.]</supplied> His acquaintance with the science seems to have been more extensive than profound; his stile is elegant&#x2014;perhaps somewhat <pb id="pg-01-103" n="01:103"/>too florid, and interspersed with metaphors which an English critic might be tempted sometimes to call conceited&#x2014; I wish I were an Astronomer&#x2014; Is it not an interesting reflection to consider, that a little creature such as man-tho&#x2019; his eye can see the heaven but as it were for a moment&#x2014;is able to delineate the aspects which it presented long ages before he came into being&#x2014;and to predict the aspects which it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> present when ages shall have gone by. The past the present &#x26; the future are before him.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is worth noting that Carlyle&#x2019;s study of mathematics and astronomy helped to provide a spatial basis for his well-known doctrine of &#x201C;the Eternities&#x201D; and &#x201C;the Immensities.&#x201D;</note> Assuredly the human species never performed a more honourable atchievement. &#x2018;The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gray&#x2019;s &#x201C;Elegy,&#x201D; IX, 1.</note> must disappear like those that delighted in them; but when the hand that wrote the <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> is reduced to a little black earth, and the spirit that dictated it is gone no one knows whither&#x2014;the work itself remains in undecaying majesty to all generations.&#x2014; But Dr Chalmers, it would seem, is fearful lest these speculations lead us away from Christianity and has written a volume of discourses<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Chalmers (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), <hi rend="italic">A Series of Discourses on the Christian Revelation, Viewed in Connection with the Modern Astronomy</hi> (Glasgow, <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>).</note> to prove that the insignificance of our planet in the universe is no argument against the truth of religion. Orthodox men declare, of course, that he has completely discomfited his opponents&#x2014; I read it sometime ago&#x2014; It abounds in that fiery thoroughgoing stile of writing for which the Author is so remarkable: nevertheless his best argument seems to be, that as it is in the scriptures, we have no business to think about it <supplied>[at]</supplied> all&#x2014;an argument which was well enough known to be a panacea in cases of that nature&#x2014;before his volume saw the light. One is a little surprised to see the Dr so vehement in his praise of Newton&#x2014;for what certainly was very laudable&#x2014;his rejecting all manner of probabilities, and refusing to admit any hypothesis till it was supported by direct and incontrovertible proof. Without doubt this answers exactly in the present instance&#x2014;but if carried to its full extent in the other side it will lead to alarming results. Christianity itself is only supported by probabilities; very strong ones certainly, but still only probabilities. But here, we are informed, it is necessary to &#x2018;sit down with the docility of little children&#x2019; and believe every thing that is told us&#x2014;which is a very comfortable way of reasoning. It is perhaps not surprising that the Author should be dogmatical; but it seems strange, when his own side of the question is so very evident, that he should deal so largely in <pb id="pg-01-104" n="01:104"/>denunciations against his adversaries. It is very certain that the unhappy sceptic cannot believe one jot the better&#x2014;tho&#x2019; he were brayed in a mortar&#x2014; Yet almost all the writers on the evidences of Christianity that I have seen (excepting Paley<supplied>[)]</supplied><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Paley (<date when="1743-00-00">1743</date>&#x2013;<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>), <hi rend="italic">A View of the Evidences of Christianity</hi> (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>); <hi rend="italic">Natural Theology</hi> (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>).

The remainder of the review is good reading; but as you will have seen it before this time, I will not trouble you farther on the matter&#x2014; I have seen the last Number of the Quarterly review.

<p><salute>My Dear Johnston&#x2014;</salute>I fear you are already fretting at my silence; and, as I have no satisfactory apology to offer&#x2014;it would but augment your dudgeon to attempt one. Therefore, without preface, I desire you to be content, &#x26; you shall hear all things in their order.&#x2014; To begin at the beginning&#x2014;The day after my parting with you &#x26; Mitchell was rainy&#x2014;and I spent it at home&#x2014;in a state of torpid &#x26; unprofitable dreaming. But, next morning being dry, I resolved to commence my journey. Sandy accompanied me to Moffat; and during my ride my mind was occupied with all the cheering reflections which a passage thro&#x2019; Tweedsmuir, the recommencement of paedagogy, and the jolting of a strong cart-horse naturally inspired. About two o&#x2019;clock, I was on the summit of Arrick-stane.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erickstanebrae, a hill 1,566 feet high contiguous to the meeting point of Dumfries, Peebles, and Lanark shires overhanging the high road from Dumfries to Edinburgh five miles north-northwest of Moffat and terminating at the roadside in an immense hollow known as &#x201C;The Devil&#x2019;s Beeftub.&#x201D;</note> I looked down through the long &#x26; deep vale of the Annan, remembered my friends upon the dim horizon, and half-uttering the wish that rose within me for their welfare, I turned me round &#x26; pursued the tenor of my way. In a short time I overtook two fellow-travellers. One of them was a peasant of those parts; the other a stout square-made <supplied>[man]</supplied> of thirty, in sailor&#x2019;s clothes without shoes or shirt&#x2014;with a countenance that seemed tanned by wind &#x26; weather, and expressive at once of energy &#x26; harmlessness. Upon investigation, I found that this unlucky person was one Thomas Cuvallo, a native of Constantinople, whose father had gone from the neighbourhood of Corinth&#x2014;that he had served two years on board the Achilles English ship of war&#x2014;was discharged in <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2014;had <pb id="pg-01-107" n="01:107"/>afterwards been twice at India whence he had returned last spring&#x2014; &#x26; that travelling from one harbour to another in the vain hope of finding a vessel to carry him to his own country, he had expended all his money, &#x26; was now, as a last resort, making his way to Leith, to try to procure either a passage to the Continent or work to keep him from starving till times should mend. This Thomas Cuvallo, cast thus forlornly upon the wolds of Tweed<supplied>[d]</supplied>ale, seemed to view his condition with anindifference that Zeno himself might have envied. The present of a piece of bread &#x26; cheese which Mrs Johnston had stowed into my pocket at Moffat, secured me his favour, and rendered him very communicative&#x2014;tho&#x2019; his stock of English vocables was far from extensive. After repeating me the Greek alphabet, he gave me the names of several objects in Romaic&#x2014;most of which bore a striking resemblance to the Hellenic; and when I inquired the signification of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Zo&#xEB; mou sas agapo</hi></foreign>, he replied with a grin of intelligence&#x2014;&#x201C;My life, I love thee.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Byron&#x2019;s &#x201C;Maid of Athens, ere we part&#x201D; (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>).</note> Then he proceeded to unfold to me the various grievances &#x26; molestations to which he (being a Djowr)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Or <hi rend="italic">Giaour</hi>, a term of reproach applied by Moslems to Christians. See Byron&#x2019;s poem <hi rend="italic">The Giaour</hi> (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>).</note> was exposed in Istambol&#x2014;interspersing some account of his adventures in the Levant, together with notices of Mullahs, jemesms, &#x26; spinning Dervishes. Insensibly he digressed into the subject of magic &#x26; divination&#x2014;and then set about revealing to me his ideas touching miracles &#x26; spectres. He said there were ten kinds of spectres&#x2014;under the head of miracles&#x2014; he told me of certain pictures in St Sophia&#x2019;s Church which no efforts of the Turks can efface, though they scrape &#x26; whitewash never so manfully. In the same church, it seems<supplied>[,]</supplied> there is a pulpit into which these unhappy Mussulmans can never gain admittance&#x2014;axes and crows avail them nothing: but every Easter-eve there appears in it the figure of a man reading in a book, which when he shall have finished, the Muhammedan empire shall pass away for ever. He told me likewise of a well in Constantinople which contains a fish whose history is very remarkable. It happened to be frying in a pan in the palace, at the time the Turks were about to enter the city; when the incredulous &#x26; phlegmatic sov<supplied>[e]</supplied>reign declared to the General who came to ask his advice, that he would as soon believe that this fish would jump from his frying-pan and live, as that the Turks were within many leagues of him. Whereupon the fish sprang out with great agility, and at this hour, he said, is living in its well&#x2014;on<supplied>[e]</supplied> side roasted and the <pb id="pg-01-108" n="01:108"/>other raw&#x2014;and intends to do so till Greece shall be finally delivered from bondage. He never saw it<supplied>[,]</supplied> but his mother did. On our arrival at the Bield,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See map.</note> I presented this unfortunate Argive with a draught of porter; and leaving him&#x2014;with a shilling, half a foot of tobacco, and my best wishes to exert his begging powers in the neighbourhood;&#x2014;I advanced to Broughton in the midst of rain&#x2014;and reached it at nightfall. In about half an hour there came a <foreign><hi rend="italic">return chaise</hi></foreign>, into which I mounted: and after being dosed by the quaverings of a foolish Grocer who frequently attempted to sing, and sometimes amused by the proofs which our driver (a kind of Cuddie Headrigg<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A character in Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Old Mortality</hi> (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>).</note> fellow) produced of the insanity of Kennedy &#x26; his fair wife&#x2014;both of renowned memory in your country&#x2014;I came to Noblehouse at ten o&#x2019;clock. Next day at noon I was in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; met with Irving at Leith in the evening, and finally without loss or detriment I reached my habitation in time for tea.</p>
<p>Thus, you see, after all the pains &#x26; pleasures, and triumphs and discomfitures, and perils by land and water which a month spent in journeying upon the face of this fair earth has caused me to experience, I find myself once more seated in my little chamber in this ancient burgh of Kirkcaldy&#x2014;all my labours (like those of many wiser persons) having brought me only to the place from whence I started. Now that I have shaken hands with my honest neighbours, and resumed my occupations, I find that the remembrance of the wild and wondrous features of the Highlands<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the walking tour of the Scottish Highlands which Carlyle made in the summer of <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date> with Pears, Edward Irving, and James Brown (who taught Jane Welsh at Haddington), see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 43 ff., and JB to TC, <date when="1817-09-16">16 Sept.</date></note> assorts but awkwardly with the vulgar feelings to which the duties of a school give rise. Nevertheless I am peaceful &#x26; contented<supplied>[,]</supplied> and my days pass on pleasantly enough. What I deplore is that laziness and dissipation of mind to which I am still subject. At present I am quieting my conscience with the thought that I shall study very diligently this winter. Heaven grant it be so! for without increasing in knowledge what profits it to live? Yet the commencement has been inauspicious. Three weeks ago I began to read Wallace&#x2019;s Fluxions<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By William Wallace (<date when="1768-00-00">1768</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>) in the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi>.</note> in the Encyclopaedia, and had proceeded a little way, when the Quarterly Review, some problems in a very silly Literary and Statistical Magazine<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Literary and Statistical Magazine for Scotland</hi> (Edinburgh), <date when="1817-02-00">Feb. 1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-11-00">Nov. 1820</date>.</note> of which the the schoolmasters are supporters, <pb id="pg-01-109" n="01:109"/>Mad<hi rend="italic">m</hi> de Sta&#xEB;l&#x2019;s Germany,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published in the original language in Paris and London in <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date> and in the English translation of Francis Hodgson in the same year.</note> etc. etc., have suspended my operations these ten days. After all I am afraid that this winter will pass as others have done before it&#x2014;unmarked by improvement; and what is to hinder the next, &#x26; its followers till the end of the short season allotted me to do so likewise? Pitiful destiny! my friend&#x2014;yet how to be avoided? Lately I was renewing my old project of going to the French university. I have flattered myself with the thought, that the collision with so many foreign minds, all toiling with might and main after the same object<supplied>[,]</supplied> <supplied>[might?]</supplied> excite in me a permanent enthusiasm sufficient to carry me as far as my powers would go&#x2014;straight forward&#x2014;and not in the zig-zag directi<supplied>[o]</supplied>ns&#x2014;now flying now creeping which I at present pursue. Once I had almost determined next time I went to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to enquire whether it would be possible to put this scheme in execution. But I suppose&#x2014;it will shortly dissipate&#x2014;like other schemes of a similar nature, and leave me to form resolutions, and lament their failure as before. You will think me very weak and silly: I think so myself (<foreign><hi rend="italic">hinc illae lacrymae</hi></foreign>) [hence were those tears],<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Terence, <hi rend="italic">Andria</hi>, I, i, 99 (also Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Pro Caelio</hi>, and Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi>).</note> and know not whether I shall ever mend. I hope you order these matters better at Hitchill.</p>
<p>I told you I had seen the Quarterly Review. You would notice its contents in the newspaper. It is a long time since I ceased to be one of its admirers. The writers pos<supplied>[s]</supplied>ess no inconsiderable share of dogmatism; and their learning, which they are, to an unpleasant degree, fond of displaying<supplied>[,]</supplied> is of that minute &#x26; scholastic nature which is eminently distinguished from knowledge. Moreover their zeal for the &#x2018;Social order&#x2019; seems to eat them up<supplied>[,]</supplied> and their horror of revolution is violent as a hydrophobia. These qualities are prominent in the last number&#x2014;and accordingly it contains much disgusting matter; but I like it better as a whole, than some of its predecessors. There is in it a distant and respectful but severe criticism on Dugald Stewart&#x2019;s writings,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>, XXXIII (<date when="1817-04-00">April 1817</date>).

(<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>).</note> It is the most stupid &#x26; villainous novel that I have read for a great while. Considerable portions of it are <pb id="pg-01-110" n="01:110"/>grossly indecent<supplied>[,]</supplied> not to say brutish&#x2014;one does not care a straw about one of the characters&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; &#x2018;little Mat&#x2019; has legions of ghosts &#x26; devils at his bidding&#x2014;one views their movements with profound indifference. I have seen the first number of Constable&#x2019;s new magazine<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Founded in Edinburgh as the <hi rend="italic">Scots Magazine</hi>.

Barley seems to be the principal crop in this neighbourhood&#x2014;and all hands are now busily engaged in cutting it.

<p>It is a great while, My dear Mitchell, since I wrote you a letter that did not require an apology for its lateness. You too are chargeable with similar practices&#x2014;and could I with any conscience&#x2014;I would rate you very severely.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his last letter to Carlyle, <date when="1817-10-04">4 Oct.</date>, Mitchell had apologized for being late in writing.</note> It is certainly a deplorable way of proceeding. If it be true, in your case, as it is in mine, that the letters which pass between us, occassion some of the happiest feelings that diversify this languid scene&#x2014;it is pity that they are, on both sides, so sparingly supplied&#x2014; I am no stranger to the dreary sense of vacuity that occupies the soul of him who sits down to fill a fair unblotted sheet of paper&#x2014;when fit materials are wanting. But we are too fastidious in our choice of subjects; and, above all, we ought to exert ourselves. It cannot be expected, that leading this unvaried life, which Providence has allotted us, we should have any wonderful tidings to communicate. We have nothing to say about the musical glasses or <hi rend="italic">bon ton</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An instrument called musical glasses, also called a harmonica in the eighteenth century, was played with a dampened finger. &#x201C;They would talk of nothing &#x2026; but pictures, taste, Shakespeare, and the musical glasses&#x201D; (Goldsmith, <hi rend="italic">Vicar of Wakefield</hi>, chap. ix). <hi rend="italic">Bon ton</hi> is good style, good breeding.</note>&#x2014;nor can we pretend to speak of moving accidents by flood &#x26; field, of Cannibals that each other eat&#x2014;the Anthropophagi<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, I, iii.</note>&#x2014;or aught of that nature. Yet are we not destitute of topics. The feelings and adventures of each of us (tho&#x2019; of no moment to nearly all the world beside) may be interesting to the other&#x2014;&#x26; by mutually communicating the progress of our studies, and the ideas (if any) that at times penetrate these benighted minds of ours&#x2014;we may be encouraged to proceed on our way; rejoicing together&#x2014;without flattery or jealousy or any such thing &#x2014; I desire you to ponder upon this subject with due attention&#x2014; Let us both write oftener&#x2014;No matter how dull the letters be. When men cannot be social, they are content to be gregarious&#x2014;and, tho&#x2019; it be in a state of silence and torpor, experience some gratification from mere juxtaposition: so with regard to letters, it may safely be affirmed, that the shortest and meagrest is preferable to none at all&#x2014; I am writing to you <pb id="pg-01-112" n="01:112"/>at present, from a conviction of the truth &#x26; utility of this proposition&#x2014; Since my departure from your country, nothing at all worth relating has happened to me. I have gone the round of my duties with all the regularity and <foreign><hi rend="italic">sang-froid</hi></foreign> of a mill-horse. My mind has on the whole been placid&#x2014;sometimes almost stagnant. And if it be true, as Flaccus hath it, that,</p>
<lg><l><foreign><hi rend="italic">Nil admirari prope res est una</hi></foreign>&#x2014;</l>

<p>I am in a fair way of obtaining &#x26; preserving a considerable share of felicity. But I am much inclined to doubt Flaccus&#x2014; The history of my studies exhibits the same stupid pictur<supplied>[e]</supplied> of impotent resolutions and unavailing regrets as heretofore. I may lay aside my French project, when I please. What, as you say, should take me to Paris?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >RM wrote (<date when="1817-10-04">4 Oct.</date>): &#x201C;What wild goose scheme is this of yours of going to France. Do you not know that the Polytechnic School is knocked on the head&#x2014; The rest are not worth the naming.&#x201D;</note> If they could pluck from my brain this rooted indolence, it might be worth thinking of. Soon after my arrival here, I fell to Wallace&#x2019;s fluxions, with might and main. I would study, I thought, with great vehemence, every night&#x2014;and the two hours at noon, which I have to dispose of, I would devote to the reading of history and other lighter matters&#x2014; But alas! two hours I found to be insufficien<supplied>[t]</supplied>&#x2014;by degrees poor Wallace was encroached upon&#x2014;and is now all but finally discarded. His introduction, it must be confessed, is ponderous &#x26; repulsive. His horrour of the binomial theorem leads him into strange bye-paths. But he demonstartes [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] with great rigour. The worst of it is, we are led to his conclusion, as it were thro a narrow lane&#x2014;often, by its windings shutting from our view the object of our search&#x2014;and never affording us a glimpse of the surrounding country&#x2014; I wish I had it in my head&#x2014; But, unless I quit my historical pursuits, it may be doubted whether this will ever happen. I have read thro&#x2019; that clear &#x26; candid but coldhearted narration of David Hume<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1711-00-00">1711</date>&#x2013;<date when="1776-00-00">76</date>), <hi rend="italic">The History of England during the Reigns of James I and Charles I</hi>, 6 vols.

For style, they are rich &#x26; venerable&#x2014;for thinking, incorrect &#x26; fanciful. Some time ago, I bought me a copy of La Rochefoucault.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois VI, Duc de la Rochefoucauld (<date when="1613-00-00">1613</date>&#x2013;<date when="1680-00-00">80</date>), <hi rend="italic">R&#xE9; flexions ou sentences et maximes morales</hi> (Paris, <date when="1665-00-00">1665</date>).</note> It has been said that the basis of his system is the supposition of selflove being the motive of all our actions. It rather seems, as if he had laid down no system at all. Regarding man as a wretched, mischievous thing, little better than a kind of vermin, he represents him as the sport of his passions, above all of vanity, and exposes the secret springs of his conduct always with some wit, and (&#x2019;bating the usual sacrifices of accuracy to smartness), in general, with great truth &#x26; sagacity&#x2014;</p>
<p>I perused your theorems with some attention. They are well worthy of a place in the Courier&#x2014;though not for the purpose you mention. Mr Johnston, if I mistake not, is a small Gentleman, whom it would be no honour to demolish. I have scarce<supplied>[l]</supplied>y done a problem since I saw you. There is one&#x2014;&#x2018;to find the locus of the vertex of a triangle, whose base is given, the one angle at the base being double of the other&#x2019;&#x2014;which I was trying some time ago&#x2014; You will easily see that the locus is a hyperbola. The solution of problems, I begin to think, depends very much upon a certain slight of hand, that can be acquired, without great difficulty, by frequent practice&#x2014; I am not so sure as I used to be that it is the best way of employing one&#x2019;s self&#x2014; Without doubt it concentrates our Mathematical ideas<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle first wrote <hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi>, then canceled it and wrote <hi rend="italic">ideas</hi>.</note>&#x2014;and exercises the head; but little knowledge is gained by the process&#x2014; If I am wrong, put me right when you send me a letter&#x2014;</p>
<p>It is long since I was at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and when I was there nothing of importance was a doing.

<p>O thou Turk in grain!</p>
<p>Did not I send thee long ago, a letter of three dense pages? Have not I any afternoon&#x2014;these three months, turned my eye to the mantlepiece, upon my return from school, to see if peradventure the postman had brought me no word from Hitchill? And did he ever bring me any? Have not I&#x2014; But what availeth it to talk. In sobriety I am dreadfully enraged. Write me a letter, I say, without further parley, or I will roar (as Bottom saith) so that it shall do any man&#x2019;s heart good to hear me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</hi>, II, i.</note> It is vain to tell me that you have no subject. Send me the meditations of your own heart&#x2014;send me a register of your domestic occurrences&#x2014;in short any thing&#x2014;an account of the prices of grain &#x26; black Cattle rather than nothing at all.</p>
<p>My history since I wrote last to you contains no particular worth relating. I continue to follow my vocation with a peaceful &#x26; quiet heart&#x2014;and might live under my vine &#x26; fig-tree, in case I had one&#x2014;with none to make me afraid.&#x2014; I will not detain you long with my studies&#x2014; I have been reading little except Coxe&#x2019;s travels in Switzerland, Poland Russia &#x26;c<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Coxe (<date when="1747-00-00">1747</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>) published his <hi rend="italic">Travels in Switzerland</hi> in <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date> and his <hi rend="italic">Travels in Poland, Russia, Sweden and Denmark</hi> in <date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>.</note> Humes history<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18171119-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1817-11-19">19 Nov.</date></ref></note> together with part of Smollet<supplied>[t]</supplied>, Gibbon &#x26;c. Coxe is an intelligent man, and communicates in a very popular manner considerable information concerning the countries thro&#x2019; which he passed&#x2014; Hume you know to be distinct &#x26; impartial: but he has less sympathy than might be expected with the heroic patriots&#x2014;the Hampdens &#x26; the Sidneys that glorify the pages of English history. I fear Smollett is going to be a confused creature. I have read but a volume of Gibbon&#x2014;and I do not like him&#x2014;his style is flowery&#x2014;his sarcasms wicked&#x2014;his notes oppressive, often beastly.&#x2014; They that cultivate literary small-talk have been greatly attracted for some <pb id="pg-01-116" n="01:116"/>time by the late number of Blackwoods (formerly the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>) Magazine.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.</note> It contains many slanderous insinuations against the Publisher&#x2019;s rivals&#x2014;particularly a paper entitled &#x2018;translation of a Chaldee manuscript&#x2019;&#x2014;concerning the author &#x26; date of which, it is gravely asserted, the celebrated Sylvester de Sacy<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron Silvestre de Sacy (<date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), French orientalist.</note> is writing a dissertation. The piece is divided into chapters &#x26; verses, &#x26; written in the Scripture language. It relates, in an emblematical manner, the rise, progress, decline &#x26; fall of the late Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> magazine. Constable &#x26; the Editors as well as most of the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Authors are bitterly lampooned&#x2014;under the similitudes of magicians, enchanters, spirits, birds &#x26; fourfooted beasts. The writer displays some talents&#x2014;but his malice and profanity are as conspicuous as his wit. Three prosecutions have been raised against Blackwood on account of it&#x2014;and the press is groaning with animadversions &#x26; replies.&#x2014; It is curious too <supplied>[to]</supplied> observe the importance which the writings of Walter Scott have conferred on every thing pertaining to the Border. These manufacturers deal largely in that article. Not a beldame, in the Merse,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Part of Berwickshire.</note> can plant her cabbages&#x2014;nor a tinker solder his kettle, but it must be forthwith communicated to the public in Blackwoods or the Scots Magazine. As if the Public had any thing to do with the matter. I marvel that they have not some correspondent in the West Marches, to transmit them intelligence about the spoon-men of Hightae, and the visions of Madam Peel.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Hightae was the headquarters of the tinkers and spoonmakers in Dumfriesshire. &#x2018;Madam Peel&#x2019; of Ecclefechan had a dream, in which she saw the death-lights going fuming by&#x201D; (Norton&#x2019;s note).</note> The dead-lights &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">gawn luntin by</hi></foreign>&#x2019; would be a rare morsel for them.</p>
<p>Little occurs in this neighbourhood to disturb our tranquillity&#x2014;and still less that you would care for hearing&#x2014; I attended the examination of Irvings academy lately. He acquitted himself dextrously, and seemed to give general satisfaction. His assistant is gone to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;and he now manages the school himself&#x2014;more comfortably, I hear, than formerly.&#x2014; A month ago that same Allen,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matthew Allen. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200519-TC-MAL-01">TC to <sic>MA</sic><corr>MAL</corr>, <date when="1820-05-19">19 May 1820</date></ref>.</note> whom I once mentioned before, gave us a concluding lecture on the applications of Spurzhiem&#x2019;s theory of Cranioscopy. It was greatly past comprehension. He seemed to have taken the fly-wheels from his brain, and said to it&#x2014;brain be at thy speed&#x2014;produce me stuff&#x2014;no matter of what colour, shape or texture:&#x2014;and truly it was a frantic, incoherent story as heart <pb id="pg-01-117" n="01:117"/>could wish. It appears to have knocked the bottom out of Spurzhiem&#x2019;s doctrine, in these parts.&#x2014; Next came these sundry players and other migratory animals of that sort. Last week we had a reciting man, Mr Hamilton from Glasgow. Perhaps Miss Harper may have seen him. He understands his trade well; but he is a drinking dog.&#x2014; The other day, there arrived from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, a large shoal of preachers&#x2014;Dixon, Nichol, Bullock, &#x26;c&#x2014;they preached all along this coast of ours&#x2014; I heard Dixon&#x2014;on death;&#x2014;somewhat in King Cambyses&#x2019; vein<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Dickson (as he signed his name), a friend of Carlyle and Edward Irving, was a farmer and preacher. He left Scotland about <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date> to spend a year as Scottish chaplain in Bermuda.

He farmed at Belkathill at Dryfe in Dumfriesshire, where he lived with a married sister and three pupils from Bermuda. Carlyle and he exchanged visits, and he got on very well with Carlyle&#x2019;s mother. After Carlyle&#x2019;s marriage in <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>, he lost touch with Dickson, but Carlyle&#x2019;s brother James saw him in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>, miserable and poverty-stricken, near a poor cottage on the road from Ecclefechan to Moffat.

<p>It is past midnight&#x2014;so I shall have done. Greet Mrs Church &#x26; Miss Harper in my name. Mr Church will prefer an account of the harvest to compliments. Therefore let him know that the state of Agricultural affairs in this district is very pitiful. The crops are backward to a degree that is quite unaccountable&#x2014;and not paralelled by any season <pb id="pg-01-118" n="01:118"/>within the memory of man. Part of the oats is uncut: and the whole country hereabout &#x26; westward, as I learn, is covered with shocks.

<p>I pray&#x2014;or rather I command you, for so it is fitting&#x2014;to be satisfied with this rigmarole epistle&#x2014;and duly to consider its contents, as you shall answer for the same.

<p>After an arduous str<supplied>[uggle]</supplied> with sundry historians of grea<supplied>[t and]</supplied> small renown I sit down to answer the much-valued epistle of my friend. Doubtless you are disposed to grumble that I have been so long in doing so; but I have an argument in store for you. To state the proposition logically&#x2014;this letter, I conceive, must either amuse you or not. If it amuse you&#x2014;then certainly you cannot be so unreasonable as to cavil at a little harmless delay: and if it do not&#x2014;you will rather rejoice that your punishmen<supplied>[t]</supplied> has not been sooner inflicted. Having thus briefly fixed you between the horns of my dilemma&#x2014;from which, I flatter myself, no skill will suffice to extricate you&#x2014;I proceed with a peaceful and fearless <supplied>[mi]</supplied>nd.</p>
<p>My way of life is still after the former fashion. I continue <supplied>[to teach]</supplied> (that I may subsist thereby), with about as much satisfaction as I <pb id="pg-01-119" n="01:119"/>should beat hemp, if such were my vocation. Excepting one or two individuals, I have little society that I value very highly, but books are a ready and effectual resource. May blessings be upon the head of Cadmus or the Phoenicians or whoever it was that invented books! I may not detain you with the praises of an art that carries the voice of man to the extremities of the earth, and to the latest generation, but it is lawful for the solitary wight to express the love he feels for those companions so stedfast and unpresuming&#x2014;that go or come without reluctance, and that when his fellow animals are proud or stupid or peevish, are ever ready to cheer the languor of his soul, and gild the barrenness of life with the treasures of byegone times. Now and then I cross the Frith: but these expeditions are not attended with much enjoyment. The time has been when I would have stood a-tiptoe at the name of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> V, IV, iii; and Keats&#x2019;s fondness for the word <hi rend="italic">tiptoe</hi>. The word seemed to be enjoying a special popularity at this time.</note>&#x2014;but all that is altered now. The men with whom I meet are mostly preachers and students in divinity. These persons desire, not to understand Newton&#x2019;s philosophy but to obtain a well 'plenished manse. Their ideas, which are uttered with much vain jangling and generally couched in a recurring series of quips and most slender puns, are nearly confined to the church- or rather kirk-session politics of the place, the secret habits, freaks and adventures of the clergy or professors, the vacant parishes and their presentees, with patrons, tutors and all other appurtenances of the tythe-pig-tail.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi>, I, iv: &#x201C;And sometimes comes she with a tithe-pig&#x2019;s tail, / Tickling a parson&#x2019;s nose as a' lies asleep. / Then dreams he of another benefice. &#x2026;&#x201D;</note> Such talk is very edifying certainly: but I take little delight in it. My Theological propensities may be included within small compass&#x2014;and with regard to witlings, jibers or such small gear&#x2014;the less one knows of them, it is not the worse. Yet there are some honest persons with whom I sometimes spend an afternoon comfortably enough.&#x2014; Before leaving this subject I wish to ask how <hi rend="italic">your</hi> theological studies are advancing&#x2014;and chiefly when you are to be at Kirkcaldy? I doubt my career &#x2018;in the above line&#x2019; has come to a close. Perhaps I have already told you that there are a thousand preachers on the field at present. Now from calculation founded on <hi rend="italic">data</hi> furnished me by persons well versed in these matters&#x2014;and managed by the rules laid down in Dilworth<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle could have had two works by Thomas Dilworth (d. <date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>) in mind: <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Arithmetic</hi> (London, <date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>) and <hi rend="italic">The Schoolmaster&#x2019;s Assistant: Being a Compendium of Arithmetic both Practical and Theoretical</hi> (London, <date when="1744-00-00">1744</date>).</note>&#x2014;I find that the last draught of these expectants, supposing <hi rend="italic">no <pb id="pg-01-120" n="01:120"/>new</hi> ones to appear in the interim, will at their settlement be upon the verge of their grand climacteric. After which, the<supplied>[ir]</supplied> &#x2018;prospects of being useful&#x2019; cannot, one would think, be very bright.</p>
<p>I am sorry that Mathematics cause hepatitis in you. The pursuit of truth is certainly the most pleasing and harmless object, that can engage the mind of man in this troublous world: and where shall we find her in her native purity, if not in the science of quantity and number? I counsel you to resume your operations as soon as your cranium will permit&#x2014;which I trust will happen without loss of time. You will thank me no doubt for this sage advice; but if you knew the need I have of it myself, you would be the more disposed to admire my generosity. It is long since I told you that I had begun Wallace,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170925-TC-JJ-01">TC to JJ, <date when="1817-09-25">25 Sept. 1817</date></ref>.</note> and that foreign studies had cast him into the shade. The same causes still obstruct my progress. You will perhaps be surprised that I am even now no farther advanced than the &#x2018;circle of curvature.&#x2019; I have found his demonstrations circuitous but generally rigourous. Yet I must except the proof of Maclaurin&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Colin Maclaurin (<date when="1698-00-00">1698</date>&#x2013;<date when="1746-00-00">1746</date>), Scottish author of various works on mathematics.</note> theorem in pag<supplied>[e]</supplied> 4<supplied>[14?]</supplied>&#x2014;which, if I were not a little man &#x26; Wallace a great, I should have small hesitation to pronounce unsatisfactory not to say absurd. I suppose I had read Hume&#x2019;s England when I wrote last; and I need not repeat my opinion of it. My perusal of the continuation&#x2014;eight volumes, of history as it is called, by Tobias Smollett M.D. and others was a much harder and more unprofitable task. Next I read Gibbon&#x2019;s decline and fall of the Roman empire&#x2014;a work of immense research and splendid execution. Embracing almost all the civilised world, and extending from the time of Trajan to the the [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] taking of Constantinople by Mahomet II in <date when="1453-00-00">1453</date>, it connects the events of ancient with those of modern history. Alternately delighted and offended by the gorgeous coulouring with which his fancy invests the rude and scanty materials of his narrative; sometimes fatigued by the learning of his notes, occassionally amused by their liveliness frequently disgusted with their obscenity, and admiring or deploring the bitterness of his skilful irony&#x2014;I toiled through his massy tomes with exemplary patience. His style is exuberant, sonorous and epigrammatic to a degree that is often displeasing. He yields to Hume in elegance and distinctness&#x2014;to Robertson<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Robertson (<date when="1721-00-00">1721</date>&#x2013;<date when="1793-00-00">93</date>), Scottish historian, author of <hi rend="italic">History of Scotland, <date when="1542-00-00">1542</date>&#x2013;<date when="1603-00-00">1603</date></hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>), <hi rend="italic">History of the Reign of Emperor Charles V</hi> (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>), and <hi rend="italic">History of America</hi> (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>).</note> in talents for general <pb id="pg-01-121" n="01:121"/>disquisition&#x2014;but he excels them both in a species of brief &#x26; shrewd remark for which he seems to have taken Tacitus as a model, more than any other that I know of. The whole historical triumvirate are abundantly destitute of virtuous feeling&#x2014;or indeed of any feeling at all. I wonder what benefit is derived from reading all this stuff. What business of mine is it tho&#x2019; Timur Beg erected a pyramid of eighty thousand human sculls in the valley of Bagdad, &#x26; made an iron cage for Bajazet? or what have I to do with the cold-blooded savage policy of Charles, and the desolating progress either of Zinghis [Genghis] or Napoleon? It is in vain to tell us that our knowledge of human nature is encreased by the operation. <hi rend="italic">Useful</hi> knowledge of that sort is acquired not by reading but experience. And with regard to political advantages&#x2014;the less one knows of them, the greater will be his delight in the principles of my Lords Castlereagh &#x26; Sidmouth,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>), foreign secretary, and Henry Addington, Viscount Sidmouth (<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>), Tory politicians and statesmen.</note> with their circulars, suspensions, holy leagues and salvation of Europe. Yet if not profit there is some <hi rend="italic">pleasure</hi> in history at all events. I believe we must not apply the <foreign><hi rend="italic">cui bono</hi></foreign> too rigourously. It may be enough to sanction any pursuit that it gratifies an innocent &#x26; still more an honourable propensity of the human mind.&#x2014; When I look back upon this paragraph, I cannot but admit, that reviewing is a very beneficial art. If a dull man take it into his head to write either for the press or the post office, without materials&#x2014;at a dead lift, it never fails to extricate him. But too much of one thing&#x2014;as it is in the adage. Therefore I reserve the account of Hume&#x2019;s essays<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably <hi rend="italic">Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects</hi>, 2 vols. (London and Edinburgh, <date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>).</note> till another opportunity. At any rate the Second volume is not finished yet&#x2014;and I do not like what I have read of any thing so well as I did the first.

<salute>My Dear Johnston,</salute>
<p>I have been engaged, for the last ten days; in a painful and till very lately, fruitless search after some demonstrations in Dynamics; or I would immediately have answered your long-expected letter. It came to me on tuesday fortnight, and effectually dissipated some unpleasant surmises that were beginning to insinuate themselves upon me. I intreat you be of good cheer: I harbour no resentment against you at all, but rather the contrary. It is not difficult to feel the force of your excuses: and I gladly impute your silence to the causes you enumerate&#x2014;combined with the presence of that unblessed dancingmaster, who I understand has infested your borders all winter. &#x2018;Fastidiousness&#x2019; of which I am deeply guilty, is a mortal sin in letter-writing. If we were secretaries of state, and our letters despatches, it might be pardonable, but as we are, nothing can be more absurd. The recital of wonderful events, the flowers of rhetoric or the niceties of grammar are not necessary or even well-fitted to delight in the converse of friends. Let me hear more of your domestic and personal history&#x2014;your feelings, anecdotes, remarks&#x2014;taciturnity be sure is worst of all.</p>
<p>Your news were very acceptable. I hope Robt. Jeffrey will get Girthon Kirk.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He did. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230808-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1823-08-08">8 Aug. 1823</date></ref>.</note> He has lain long at the pool, and now that the waters are stirring,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John 5:3&#x2013;4.</note> it will be hard if he miss the opportunity. Murray,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Murry.</note> I believe, had never a good chance and has now none at all for the benefice.&#x2014; I learn by a letter from Sandy<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s brother Alexander.</note> that James Donaldson Sen<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is dead and that his son is in extreme danger.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The younger Donaldson died too. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18180626-TC-JJ-01">TC to JJ, <date when="1818-06-26">26 June</date></ref>.</note> What the flight of a few years can bring about! You should go to see poor Donaldson, and send me word particularly how he is. Without doubt you acted wisely in preferring your present situation to any that Mrs. S. could offer you at Ecclefechan. The happiness of living in a sensible, well-regulated and kind family is not to be put in competition with pounds at all. I am glad you find so much pleasure in chess. It appears to be an innocent perhaps profitable amusement; and he that snarls at it must be of malignant <pb id="pg-01-124" n="01:124"/>mood. The regret which you express at the slow progress of your historical studies, whether just or not, is a good sympton. It is perhaps true as cynics will say, that history is little else than a detail of the keen and likewise vulgar scramble for place and power, and that tho&#x2019; the scramblers be Kings and princes, they seldom fail to be small and very paltry men. Still it is also true that by history we live in ages that are past long ago; and there are few feelings more pure and delightful than the homage paid to departed virtue, or the contempt &#x2018;there is seldom need for anger&#x2019; which visits the unsuccessful or successful wickedness of the dead.&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Quin igitur expergiscere</hi></foreign><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Misquoted from Sallust, <hi rend="italic">Cataline</hi>, XX, 14: <foreign>&#x201C;quin igitur expergiscimini.&#x201D;</foreign></note> <supplied>[Nay, rather, wake up therefore]</supplied>, if you are really dozing, and proceed with vigour.

I have comprehended him hitherto with a little difficulty; he is a beautiful writer, and this is the smallest of his merits. It were needless to speak of pamphlets, magazines &#x26;c. which appear for a short season, and then vanish away. They are read without comfort, and remembered with remorse.</p>
<p>I would willingly say much about my life and conversation; but the events which occupy me from day to day, leave scarce a trace <pb id="pg-01-125" n="01:125"/>upon the memory. My existence is marked by almost nothing, but that silent stream of thoughts and whims and fantasies that never ceases to pervade the mind of every living man. Yet I am not without positive comforts too. True it is, I oftentimes desiderate the unrestrained and joyful intercourse which thou and I were wont to have together; but Pears and Irving whom I see very frequently, are worthy young men; And we generally have a common feeling, except when we discuss the degeneracy of the church or the blindness of patrons; about which I have long ceased to feel any lively care. I&#x2019;s time here will expire in five months, and it does not seem probable that he will renew his engagements. At present he is very fond of preaching and the bible-society. He sometimes speaks of going to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to live by private teaching&#x2014;and devote his time to pulpit-eloquence <foreign><hi rend="italic">verum enim vero is demum mihi vivere atque frui anima videtur qui aliquo negotio intentus praclari facinoris, aut artis bonae famam quaerit.</hi></foreign><note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;For indeed truly he alone seems to me to be alive and to enjoy life who seeks fame absorbed in the pursuit of some excellent work or good art&#x201D; (Sallust, <hi rend="italic">Cataline</hi>, II, 9).</note> For thee and me, to whom no famous action or profitable act holds out its glory, little remains of life&#x2019;s enjoyments, but what can be derived from these poor old books, which we have or shall have made our own: and tho&#x2019; the heritage be scanty, it is precious, capable of increase, and cannot be taken away. Therefore never fear. The society which I mentioned in my last letter, was mustered some weeks ago, and they called it Academic association I think or some such name. It seems still a matter of doubt whether it will live or die. James Grierson is to reason upon Noah&#x2019;s Deluge and the Neptunian Geology next Saterday it is easy to see how he will fare.</p>
<p>There is or can be little here to attract attention<supplied>[.]</supplied> I could without difficulty descant upon the assembly room which &#x2014;&#x2014; I might speak to you of the s<supplied>[c]</supplied>ripture parodies with their &#x2018;reviews&#x2019;&#x2014;malice of their readers, and are as stolid as the day is long, I could describe&#x2014;dancing and diray<supplied>[?]</supplied> which were intended to instruct the Gail, and feed the hungry&#x2014;but what would it avail? These things delight not me and you they would disgust&#x2014;better were it, since this night above all others the Goddess of Dulness seems to have marked me for her victim, much better were it I say, to quit&#x2014;altogether than try such shifts. <closer><salute>I desire only to put you in mind once more of the&#x2014;dangers of delay, and to tell you that I long violently (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Je meurs d'envie</hi></foreign> as the French have it) to receive a letter from your hand,&#x2014;before subscribing myself</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear friend,</salute>
<p>After parting with you on the quay of Burntisland, I proceeded slowly to the westward; and seating myself upon the brow of that crag from which the poor king Alexander <hi rend="italic">brak&#x2019;s neck-bane</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >King Alexander III of Scotland (<date when="1241-00-00">1241</date>&#x2013;86) was thrown from his horse over the precipice and killed at this spot. See Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Tales of a Grandfather</hi>, chap. vi; and Burns&#x2019;s &#x201C;Tam o' Shanter,&#x201D; l. 92. The place is now called Kinghorn.</note> I watched your fleet-sailing skiff till it vanished in the mists of the Forth. So! Mitchell is gone!&#x2014; thought I, we shall have no more chat together for many a day; but he will write me a letter in a week at any rate:&#x2014;and with that consolatory expectation, I pensively returned to Kirk<supplied>[c]</supplied>aldy. If excessive studiousness has frustrated this hope, then is it well, and I shall wait contentedly till some hour of relaxation occur, when you may sport upon paper for my benefit&#x2014;without detriment to your graver pursuits. But if sheer indolence possesses you, it were proper to cast off the noxious spell, as soon as possible.&#x2014; From the fact of my writing at present, you may conjecture (and rightly) that my own avocations are slackly pursued. My conduct, I fear, is absurd. I believe <pb id="pg-01-127" n="01:127"/>it to be a truth (and tho&#x2019; no creature believed it, it would continue to be a truth) that a man&#x2019;s dignity in the great system of which he forms a part, is exactly proportional to his moral &#x26; intellectual acquirements: and I find moreover, that when I am assaulted by those feelings of discontent &#x26; ferocity which solitude at all times tends to produce, and by that host of miserable little passions which are ever and anon attempting to disturb one&#x2019;s repose, there is no method of defeating them so effectual, as to take them in flank by a zealous course of study. I <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> all this&#x2014;but my practice clashes with my creed. I had read some little of Laplace<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pierre Simon de Laplace (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), French astronomer and mathematician.</note> when I saw you; &#x26; I continue to advance with a diminishing velocity. I turned aside into Leslie&#x2019;s conics&#x2014; &#x26; went thro&#x2019; it, in search of two propositions, which when in your geometrical vein, you will find little difficulty in demonstrating. Take them if you will.&#x2014; (I.) The straight line drawn through the focus from the extremity of a diameter to meet its conjugate, is equal to the semitransverse. From which it may be seen that (II.) The square of the diameter of an osculating circle is to the square of the chord which passes thro&#x2019; the point of osculation &#x26; the focus, as the same chord is to the parameter of the transverse axis. By the help of the latter combined with Art. 210. in Robinsons<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Robinson (<date when="1739-00-00">1739</date>&#x2013;<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>), <hi rend="italic">Elements of Mechanical Philosophy</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>).</note> mechanical philosophy, where it is shewn (very simply) that the forces by which bodies are deflected in different points of their curvilinear paths are directly as the squares of the velocities &#x26; inversely as the deflective chords of the equicurve circles in those points&#x2014;it is easy to deduce the law of the force by which a body describes an ellipse or any other conic section. Newton employed this method if we believe Robinson &#x26; Wallace; but I can find it neither in the first nor third edition of the Principia&#x2014;and I have seen no other. I likewise turned aside into Charles Bossut&#x2019;s M&#xE9;canique<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;canique</hi> is one volume in <hi rend="italic">Cours complet de math&#xE9;matique</hi>, 7 vols. (Paris, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>), by Charles Bossut (<date when="1730-00-00">1730</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>).</note>&#x2014;to study his demonstration of pendulums, and his doctrine of forces. The text is often tediously explanatory&#x2014;&#x26; in the notes, it is but a dim hallucination of the truth that I can obtain thro&#x2019; the medium of integrals &#x26; differentials by which he communicates it. However I am now pretty well convinced that a body projected from the earth with a velocity of 39,000 feet per second,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Actually above the escape velocity of the earth.</note> will never return. I got Lagrange&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-01-128" n="01:128"/><hi rend="italic">mecanique analytique</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Louis Lagrange (<date when="1736-00-00">1736</date>&#x2013;<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>), <hi rend="italic">La m&#xE9;canique analytique</hi> (Paris, <date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>).</note> also, but to me it is nearly a sealed book. After all these divarications, &#x26; more which I shall mention afterwards, you must pardon me, if I am not above half-through the <hi rend="italic">exposition du syst&#xE8;me du monde</hi>. The first volume is beautiful, &#x26; can be understood; great part of the second is demonstrated, he says, in the <hi rend="italic">m&#xE9;canique celeste</hi>, and I am obliged to be content with ignorantly admiring these sublime mysteries, which I am assured are <foreign><hi rend="italic">de hautes connaissances, les delices des &#xEA;tres pensans</hi></foreign> [high knowledge, the delights of thinking beings]. Surely it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a powerful instrument which enables the mind of a man to grasp the universe &#x26; to elicit from it &#x26; demonstrate such laws&#x2014;as that, whatever be the actions of the planets on each other, the mean distances of each from the sun &#x26; its mean motion can <hi rend="italic">never</hi> change: and that, <hi rend="italic">every</hi> variation in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of their elements must be periodical. To see these truths, my good Robert&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> them as one does the proportion of the sphere &#x26; cylinder! 'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, i.</note>&#x2014;but not very likely ever to arrive. Sometimes, indeed, on a fine evening, &#x26; when I have quenched my thirst with large potations of Souchong, I say to myself&#x2014;away with despondency&#x2014;hast thou not a soul and a kind of understanding in it? And what more has any analyst of them all? But next morning, alas, when I consider my understanding&#x2014;how coarse yet feeble it is, &#x26; how much of it must be devoted to supply the vulgar wants of life, or to master the paltry but never-ending vexations with which all creatures are beleaguered&#x2014; I ask how is it possible not to despond? Especially, when, as old Chaucer&#x2a; [TC&#x2019;s asterisk] said of the <hi rend="italic">Astrolabye</hi>, &#x201C;the conclusyons that have been founden or ells possiblye might be founde in so noble an instrument [as in an Astrolabie: TC omits], ben unknowen perfitely to any mortal man in this region, as I suppose.&#x2019;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;*Vid. his treatise of the Astrolabye, &#x2018;compowned for oure orizont after the latitude of Oxenforde,&#x2019;&#x2014;to instruct &#x2018;lytel Lowis my sonne&#x2019;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> But I fear you are tired of these prosings&#x2014;you must bear with them. Excepting the few friends whom Providence has given me, &#x26; whose kindness I wish never to forfeit, I have &#x26; am likely to have little else but these pursuits to derive enjoyment from; and there is none but you to talk it over with. They are all preaching here &#x26; care not a straw for Laplace &#x26; his calculus both. You will be preaching one of these days too&#x2014;and perhaps&#x2014; but it is needless to anticipate&#x2014;you must not leave off Mathematics.</p>

His imagination seldom quits material even sexual objects&#x2014;he describes them admirably&#x2014;and intermingles here &#x26; there some beautiful traits of natural pathos; but he seems to have failed (excepting partially the fire-worshippers) in his attempts to pourtray the fierce or lofty features of human character.

The poisoned believers sitting round the table, with their black swol<supplied>[le]</supplied>n <foreign>jobbernowls</foreign> [stupid heads] reclining on their breasts, and saucereyes fixed upon the ill-favoured prophet&#x2014;appeared so like the concluding scene of an election-dinner, when all are dead-drunk but the Provost, a man of five bottles, with a carbuncled face &#x26; an amorphous nose, that, I was forced to exclaim <foreign><hi rend="italic">du sublime au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas</hi></foreign> [it is just a step from the sublime to the ridiculous].

<salute>Dear Johnston,</salute>
<p>It is about three weeks since, upon entering my chamber on a Sunday <pb id="pg-01-131" n="01:131"/>evening&#x2014;wearied with the toil, &#x26; sick with the inanity of an excursion to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, my eyes were rejoiced by the sight of your letter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1818-06-02">2 June</date>. Johnston also writes again on <date when="1818-07-15">15 July</date>.</note>&#x2014; I must not criticise the sentiments<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnston had written: &#x201C;The having two such friends as Carlyle and Mitchell is by far the greatest of my earthly blessings: and though the desire of fame is dead within me, I do not dispair of seeing the day, when I shall stand a tiptoe at <hi rend="italic">their</hi> names.&#x201D; For <hi rend="italic">tiptoe</hi>, cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18180216-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1818-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref></note> with which you commence. The partiality of friendship, and the modesty of him who feels it may become excessive, without ceasing to be amiable. I have little genius for complimenting, and therefore shall not say, in what esteem I hold your communications. Let it be sufficient to observe that the emotions they awaken are numbered among the happiest of my life. That you write so seldom is the only subject of complaint.</p>
<p>My journey to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, you have heard, was p<supplied>[roduct]</supplied>ive of little enjoyment. How should it indeed? Most of my acquaintance are looking out for kirks: some by diligent paedogogy accompanied with a firm belief in the excellence of certain Country Gentlemen&#x2014;and others by assiduously dancing attendance upon the leading clergymen of our venerable establishment. This is as it should be&#x2014;but I have no part or lot in the matter. The rest speak of the St Anne-street<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Built in <date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>, a steep street of poor-quality houses leading down from the east end of Princes St. on the site of the present Waverley Station. There was strong opposition to a proposal in <date when="1315-00-00">1315</date> to destroy it and erect new houses alongside the bridge at the corner of Princes St. on the grounds that the view from Calton Hill would then be destroyed. The council nevertheless made arrangements to rebuild, and the work was begun in <date when="1818-05-00">May 1818</date>. The new buildings are gone now, and the North British Hotel and Waverley Station occupy the area.</note> buildings, the Brownie of Bodsbeck with other tales by James Hogg<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published in 2 vols. in <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>.</note>&#x2014;and things of that stamp&#x2014; Now the St Anne-street buildings concern only some &#x2018;feuars<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Those who take land <hi rend="italic">in feu</hi>, i.e., have it on lease for an annual rent.</note> of the extinet royalty&#x2019;:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Land over which a city or other body is given jurisdiction directly from the Crown.</note> and as for the Brownie of Bodsbeck with other tales by James Hogg&#x2014;they seem to have been written under the influence of a liquour more potent than that of the Pierian spring&#x2014;so there needs not much be said about them. If I go to the bookseller&#x2019;s shop, I find polemical sciolists, and pathetic <foreign><hi rend="italic">beaux-esprits</hi></foreign>. And when I walk along the street, I see fair women of whom it were folly to think one moment, &#x26; fops (<hi rend="italic">dandies</hi> they are named in the current slang) with carcases shaped like an hour-glass,&#x2014;creatures &#x2018;whose life and death,<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied> as Crispus<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gaius Sallustius Crispus (<date>86</date>&#x2013;<date>34 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), Sallust, Roman historian.</note> pithily observes, &#x2018;I esteem of equal importance,</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-132" n="01:132"/>and decline to speak of either&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">de tr&#xE2;que siletur</hi></foreign> [there is silence concerning both].<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied> It would be ridiculous to fret at all this. Being a person of habits, I fear, somewhat anomalous&#x2014;belonging to no profession, and having therefore (as my Lord Verulam<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Bacon. Cf. <hi rend="italic">Novum Organum</hi>, Aphor., XXXIX.</note> would say) no idol of the tribe, or rather no fashionable one, to bow down before, it is but little sympathy that I can look for.</p>
<p>I am far from &#x2018;laughing&#x2019; at your agricultural studies.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnston had written: &#x201C;As I do not like teaching, I have of late given much of my attention to agriculture. I have read Davys Agricultural chemistry several times, Sinclairs Scottish agriculture, attended to Mr Church&#x2019;s operations and observations of which he is very free. You will laugh at this.&#x201D; Mr. Church was his employer. The books read were Sir Humphrey Davy&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Elements of Agricultural Chemistry</hi> (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>) and Sir John Sinclair&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">General Report of the Agricultural State and Political Circumstances of Scotland</hi> (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>), in 5 vols.</note> Nor is it wonderful that you dislike teaching. A lover of it is rarer than a phoenix. No trade&#x2014;but why do I talk? Discontent is the most vulgar of all feelings. It is utterly useless moreover, &#x26; worse than useless. Let us cultivate our minds; and await the issue calmly, whatever it may be. The honest Hibernian had nothing to support himself, his wife and eight <hi rend="italic">childer</hi>&#x2014;nothing&#x2014;&#x2018;but these four bones&#x2019;: yet he did not murmur or despair.</p>
<p>Your project of a tour to the Cumberland Lakes meets my views exactly. Get matters arranged, and I shall gladly accompany you to Keswick or Ulleswater or whithersoever you please. Examine some map of the county&#x2014;&#x26; Grays book if possible.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle attaches a note: &#x201C;I have beside me, &#x2018;a Guide&#x2019; to these parts; by one John Housman Esq.&#x2014; but it is a frivolous book.&#x201D; The full title is A <hi rend="italic">Topographical Description of Cumberland, Westmoreland, Lancashire and a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire</hi> (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>). Presumably Gray&#x2019;s book was his &#x201C;Journal,&#x201D; in his letter to Dr. Warton (<date when="1769-10-18">18 Oct. 1769</date>), <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, II (London,<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>); or <hi rend="italic">Sketch of a Tour from Lancaster round the Principle Lakes in Lancashire, Cumberland, and Westmoreland. To which is added Mr. Gray&#x2019;s Journal</hi> (Carlisle, <date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>).</note> Cannot you persuade Mitchell to go with us? A few days will do it all. Tell him we may go by sea to Whitehaven, if it please us&#x2014;then take a peep at the desolate loch of Ennerdale&#x2014;and cross the hills to Buttermere, where we shall obtain a glimpse of the &#x2018;Beauty&#x2019; if there be any such. Next we can penetrate through Gatesgarth&#x2014;afterwards emerge from the jaws of Borrowdale&#x2014;coast the western shore of Derwentwater &#x26; ascend to the top of Skiddaw, or examine that unfathomable tarn which rests upon the shoulders of old Saddleback. We shall see Scawfell &#x26; Helvellyn, with Scale-force, <hi rend="italic">Sour-milk</hi>-force &#x26; others too tedious to mention. In fine it may improve us all, both in body &#x26; mind. You must endeavour <pb id="pg-01-133" n="01:133"/>to have the route marked out before this night (Friday) fiveweeks.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle, Mitchell, and Johnston began a tour of the Lakes together on <date when="1818-08-01">1 Aug.</date></note> On Saturday the <date when="1818-08-01">first of August</date>, if all go well, I hope to see you at Mainhill&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">you</hi> must be there any way&#x2014;if it be in your power.&#x2014; But <supplied>[it]</supplied> is time to go &#x26; sleep. To-morrow I intend to discuss (very briefly) the books I have been reading. Meanwhile I give you quarter&#x2014;for a season. Good night my dear James.&#x2014;</p>
<p><date when="1818-06-27">27th June</date>&#x2014; The last book worth mentioning, which I perused was Stewart&#x2019;s preliminary dissertation&#x2014;for the second time. The longer I study the works of this philosopher, the more I become convinced of two things. First, that in perspicacity &#x26; comprehensiveness of understanding he yields to several. But, secondly, that in taste, variety of acquirements, and, what is of more importance, in moral dignity of mind, he has no rival that I know of. Every liberal opinion has at all times found in him a zealous advocate. When he has come before the public, he has borne himself with a carriage so meek,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly an echo of <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, I, vii: &#x201C;Besides this Duncan hath borne his faculties so meek.&#x201D;</note> yet so commanding: and now&#x2014;when, with unabating ardour, he has retired to devote the last remnant of a well-spent life, to the great cause of human improvement&#x2014;his attitude is so pensively sublime&#x2014;I regard him with a reverence which I scarcely feel for any other living person. &#x2018;He is a man, take him for all in all&#x2014;we shall not look upon his like again.&#x2019;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, I, ii.</note> There is something melancholy in the thought that the world cannot long enjoy the light of such a mind.&#x2014; But &#x2018;the cup goes round; and who so artful as to put it by?&#x2019; Poor Donaldson, you see, is cut off in the prime of his days. Poor fellow! Few summers have past since he was my companion, as careless, good-natured a being as ever breathed the air of this world: and to think that he is gone, excites many painful reflections upon the obvious but solemn truth, that, the places which now know us, shall ere long know us no more, again, at all, forever.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnston had written: &#x201C;Donaldson, my play fellow, and the associate of my early years, is no more&#x201D;; and had given a long account of his last visit to him. The Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> for <date when="1818-06-02">2 June</date> carried an announcement of the death at Ecclefechan of James Donaldson, a surgeon, on <date when="1818-05-26">26 May</date> at the age of twenty-nine. He was described as &#x201C;a young man of very superior abilities and most amiable disposition.&#x201D;</note> It is foolish, we are told, to shrink from or repine at the unalterable fate, to which this earth, and that it inherits have been doomed. It is ungrateful too; for who would wish to live <hi rend="italic">thus</hi> forever?</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-134" n="01:134"/>And an hour or a thousand centuries are the same fleeting instant, in the everlasting sweep of ages that have past or are to come. <foreign>&#x2018;Ex Asia rediens&#x2019;</foreign> (says Servius Sulpicius, in his far-famed letter to Tully on the death of his daughter) <foreign>&#x2018;Cum ab Aegina Megaram versus navigarem, coepi regiones circum circa prospicere; post me erat Aegina, ante Megara, dextr&#xE2; Piraeus, sinistr&#xE2; Corinthus; quae oppida quodam tempore florentissima fuerunt, nunc prostrata et diruta ante oculos jacent. Coepi egomet mecum sic cogitare: Hem, nos homunculi indignantur, si quis nostr&#xFB;m interiit aut occisus est quorum vita brevior esse debet cum uno loco tot oppit&#xFB;m cadavera projecta jacent[! Vis]ne tu te Servi cohibere, et meminise hominem te esse natum?</foreign><note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;On my return from Asia, as I was sailing from Aegina towards Megara, I began to survey the regions round about. Behind us was Aegina, before us Megara, on the right the Piraeus, on the left Corinth, towns at one time most flourishing, now lying prostrate and demolished before one&#x2019;s very eyes. I began to think to myself: &#x2018;So! we puny mortals resent it, do we, if one of us, whose lives are naturally shorter, has died in his bed or been slain in battle, when in this one land alone there lie flung down before us the corpses of so many towns? Pray control yourself, Servius, and remember that you were born a human being&#x2019;&#x201D; (Servius Sulpicius Rufus [d. <date>43 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>], Letter of Consolation, Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Epistolae ad Familiares</hi>, IV, v).</note> All this may be true philosophy&#x2014;yet still some natural tears [word blurred] <supplied>[f]</supplied>all upon the graves of those whom we have loved, and who are departed to that land of darkness &#x26; of the shadow of death, about which so much is hoped or feared, and so little understood. These are mournful thoughts. They come across my mind, at times, in the stillness of these solitary nights&#x2014;and plunge me into an ocean of fearful conjectures. &#x2018;My God&#x2019; (exclaimed the melancholy &#x26; high-minded Paso<supplied>[al]</supplied>) &#x2018;enlighten my soul: or take from it this reasoning curiosity!&#x2019; Montaigne tells us he reposed upon the pillow of doubt<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An echo from Stewart&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Dissertation</hi>.

    <salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
    <p>Whilst arranging some scattered papers previously to my departure from this place, which I am to leave to morrow for Dumfriesshire&#x2014;I happened to alight upon your letter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Apparently Murray&#x2019;s undated letter written in the late winter or early spring of <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>. Murray begins it formally with &#x201C;My Dear Sir&#x201D; and says, &#x201C;I regretted much that I had never heard from you for nearly two years.&#x201D; He congratulated Carlyle on having his name mentioned in the new (third) edition of Leslie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Geometry</hi> (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>). He added in a postscript: &#x201C;Your Italian Dictionary my good friend Jenny Murray still has. I told her she might keep it while she was at School&#x2014;and I desired her to address it to you when she had done with it, at M<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. For<supplied>[r]</supplied>est&#x2019;s.&#x201D; Murray is very much dejected in this letter.</note> The recollection that it was unanswered awakened a feeling of remorse in my mind; and tho&#x2019; it is near midnight, I have determined to employ the passing hour, in writing you a few lines by way of a return for your affectionate farewell. If I have not done so sooner, impute it, I beseech you, to want of ability rather than of inclination. Be assured, I have not forgotten the many joyful days which long ago, we spent together&#x2014;Sweet days of ignorance and airy hope! They had their troubles too: but to bear them, there was a light-heartedness and buoyancy of soul, which the sterner qualities of manhood, &#x26; the harsher buffetings that require them, have forever forbidden to return.</p>
    <p>I forbear to say much of the pursuits which have engaged me. They would little interest you, I fear. With most young men, I have had dreams of intellectual greatness, and of making me a name upon the earth&#x2014; They were little else but dreams. To gain renown is what I do not hope &#x26; hardly care for, in the present state of my feelings. The improvement of one&#x2019;s mind, indeed, is the noblest object which can occupy any reasonable creature: but the attainment of it requires a concurrence of circumstances over which one has little control. I now perceive more clearly than ever, that any man&#x2019;s opinions depend not on himself so much as on the age he lives in, or even the persons with whom he associates. If his mind at all surpass their habits, his aspirings are briefly quenched in the narcotic atmosphere that surrounds him. <pb id="pg-01-136" n="01:136" />He forfeits sympathy, &#x26; procures hatred if he excel but a little the dull standard of his neighbours. Difficulties multiply as he proceeds; and none but chosen souls can rise to any height above the level of the swinish-herd&#x2014; Upon this principle, I could tell you why Socrates sacrificed at his death to Esculapius&#x2014;why Kepler wrote his cosmographic harmony,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Johann Kepler (<date when="1571-00-00">1571</date>&#x2013;<date when="1630-00-00">1630</date>), <hi rend="italic">Harmonice Mundi</hi> (<date when="1619-00-00">1619</date>).</note> &#x26; why Sir Thomas More believed the Pope to be infallible&#x2014; Nevertheless one should do what he can.</p>
    <p>I need not trouble you with the particulars of my situation. My prospects are not extremely brilliant at present. I have quitted all thoughts of the church, for many reasons, which it would be tedious perhaps displeasing to enumerate. I feel no love (I should wish to see the human creature that feels any love) for the paltry trade I follow; and there is before me a chequered and fluctuating scene, where I see nothing clearly, but that a little time will finish it. Yet wherefore should we murmur? A share of evil greater or less (the difference of shares is not worth mentioning) is the unalterable doom of mortals: and the mind may be taught to abide it in peace. Complaint is generally despicable, always worse than unavailing. It is an instructive thing, I think, to observe Lord Byron surrounded with the voluptuousness of an Italian Seraglio, chaunting a mournful strain over the wretchedness of human life;&#x2014;and then to contemplate the poor but lofty-minded Epictetus&#x2014;the slave&#x2014;of a cruel master too&#x2014;&#x26; to hear him lifting up his voice to far distant generations,  in these unforgotten words, &#x0386;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x03B5;&#x03CD;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C5; &#x1F15;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;, &#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x1F04;&#x03BB;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03C2; &#x1F10;&#x03B3;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x1F33;&#x03BD; &#x1F10;&#x03C6;' &#x03BF;&#x1F31;&#x03C2; &#x03B1;&#x1F50;&#x03C4;&#x1F78;&#x03C2; &#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x1F71;&#x03C3;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;	&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x1FA3;&#x03C2;. &#x1F20;&#x03B5;&#x03B3;&#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C5; &#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x03B5;&#x03CD;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;, &#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x03B5;&#x03B1;&#x03C5;&#x03C4;&#x1F63;

    <p>I heard with pleasure that you had got <hi rend="italic">licence</hi>, and had preached with success. May you soon obtain a settlement, and feel happy in it. A Scottish clergyman, when he does his duty faithfully, is both a useful &#x26; honourable member of society. When he neglects his office, and has subscribed his creed &#x2018;with a sigh or a smile&#x2019; (as Gibbon spicefully remarks)&#x2014;the less one says of him the better. But I hope other things of you.</p>

                                          Three weeks ago, I had a visit from the forlorn Poet Stewart Lewis. He came into the school one morning, and stood plumb up without speaking a word. I was touched to see the gray veteran, in tattered clothes &#x26; with a pensive air, waging against necessity the same unprosperous battle which, any time these forty years, has been his constant occupation. His wife died many months ago; and since that event he has been protracting a miserable, useless existence (he called it), by selling small poems of his own composing. I understand he got rid of some part of his cargo here;&#x2014;and of all his sorrows, by a copious potation of <foreign>
  <hi rend="italic">usque-baugh</hi>
</foreign> [whisky]. He spoke to me with much gratitude of a certain young lady in Wigton, who for your sake (think of that Master Brook<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Cf. <hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor,</hi> V, i.</note>), had sought out his lodgings and replenished his purse. He has many faults, and the crowning one of drunkenness&#x2014;but some genius likewise, and a degree of taste, which, considering his habits &#x26; situation is altogether surprising. Moreover he is old, and poor, and not unthankful for any kindness shown him. I pity the man &#x26; would not wish to see him die a mendicant.</p>
    <p>Perhaps you are acquainted with the tragic end of poor William Irving<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170317-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1817-03-17">17 March 1817</date>
</ref>.</note> whom you once knew. Tho&apos; auguring little good of him, I never feared that he would do that deed, which renders his name a thing which sober people may not mention. But now that it has happened, suicide seems a not unsuitable conclusion to his frantic &#x26; miserable way of life. I bewail his mournful destiny. Had the talents which he certainly did possess been cultivated with judgement, and directed by principle of any kind&#x2014;he might have been a credit to his country.</p>
    <p>If you write to me before <date when="1818-09-00">Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi>
</date> let your letter be directed to Mainhill near Ecclefechan&#x2014;after that period, to Mrs Skeen&#x2019;s Kirkwynd Kirkcaldy. Are you to leave Sorbie? I must hear of your destination. During the vacation I intend to visit the Cumberland lakes; and I should like to see Galloway also, but I cannot make it out this summer. Will you be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> any time soon? When or where shall I see you? <closer>
  <salute>Write me a letter at least when you can find leisure, and believe me to be,</salute>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Departing from home on Friday last, I reached Eskdalemoor Manse, and next day progressed laboriously by the steps of Glendarg, across Ettrick &#x26; through between the Loch of the Lowes &#x26; St Mary&#x2019;s into the farm of Henderland upon Meggat water. The hills were shrouded with a shifting screen of vapour&#x2014;frequently precipitating itself upon my poor carcase in the shape of rain. The lakes looked sweet &#x26; peaceful. Being pressed for want of time, I could not call upon your brother (tho&#x2019; I passed the foot of Glengaber&#x2014;the house two miles distant), but I left your letter in the hands of one of Anderson&#x2019;s herds&#x2014;his wife&#x2019;s I mean&#x2014;who had seen your brother that day, and expected to see him next day also.

James Carlyle&#x2019;s first wife was born Janet Carlyle, a distant relative, whom he married in <date when="1791-00-00">1791</date> and by whom there was a son, John of Cockermouth, who settled near Brantford, Ontario, Canada, and died there in <date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>.

<salute>My Dear Father,</salute>
<p>Having arrived in safety at this place, I sit down to give you an account of my adventures by the way&#x2014;and my proceedings since I left <pb id="pg-01-139" n="01:139"/>the Mainhill. After shaking hands with Sandy I winded down the Baileyhill, easily forded the Black Esk, &#x26; proceeded along the banks of its sister stream to Eskdalemoor-manse, which I reached about seven o&#x2019;clock. I cast many an anxious thought after Sandy and the horses which he was conducting: but I hope they arrived in safety after all. The minister is a kind hospitable man. Saturday morning was wet, and he would fain have persuaded me to stay all day with him; but when he could not succeed he spread before me a large map of Dumfriesshire, pointed out the best road &#x26; gave me a line to one Anderson (a cousin of his wife) from whom I was to get some meat as I passed Lyart upon Meggot [Meggat] water. After my departure the rain slackened a little, but the hill-tops were covered with a dark mist which the wind tossed about briskly. I proceeded up the Esk which originates about 6 miles above the manse in the junction of two streams, the Tomleuchar &#x26; the Glenderg of which the latter rises near the eastern edge of Ettrick Pen,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A mountain 2,269 feet high on the borders of Ettrick Parish, Selkirkshire, and Eskdalemuir, Dumfriesshire.</note> the former a few miles eastward. Ascending Glenderg I came into Ettrick water, which I crossed at a place called Cosser&#x2019;s hill, where a hospitable but sluttish &#x26; inquisitive old woman, gave me some potatoes &#x26;c with directions for finding Riskenhope the head of the two Lochs (St Mary&#x2019;s &#x26; the Lowes) upon <pb id="pg-01-140" n="01:140"/>Yarrow water, distant about four miles. I was upon the brow of a solitary ridge of moorland hills when I saw the two clear blue lakes, and in about half an hour I had crossed the stream which unites them, and was upon the road up Meggat, a brook which rises a little to the north of Whitecomb, and joins the easter<supplied>[n]</supplied>most lake (St Mary&#x2019;s) after a course of about 6 miles. When I got to Anderson&#x2019;s at Lyart it was almost 7 o&#x2019;clock, &#x26; his sister pressed me much to stay all night, the man (an arrant miser as I found afterwards) did not press me so keenly. As it was raining a little, &#x26; Peebles 14 miles distant I thought of accepting their invitation, &#x26; having got some tea was endeavouring to enter into some conversation with this rich old farmer. But when he perceived that I was going to continue with him all night he became so churlish in his replies that I could think of it no longer, &#x26; taking my hat &#x26; stick I thanked him for his entertainement, &#x26; crossed the water of Meggat leaving this Nabal<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A miserly, churlish person. See I Sam. 25:3.</note> of Yarrow with his sister in utter amazement at my departure, for it was now near eight, and the night was rainy. But in half an hour I came into <supplied>[the]</supplied> road which I had travelled over before (as I came down), &#x26; tho&#x2019; the rain continued, I reached the house of a kind herdsman upon Manor water (which comes into the Tweed near Peebles), and met with a warm reception from him after 9 o&#x2019;clock. Next morning was dry &#x26; the day became windy; so I arrived at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> that same afternoon about 5&#x2014;&#x26; staid all night with Donaldson&#x2014;formerly Irvings assistant at Kirkcaldy. Next day I saw Mr Leslie [<hi rend="italic">Irving</hi> overwritten with <hi rend="italic">Mr</hi>] who was very kind, and got me a book that I was wanting from the library &#x26; talked with me about two hours very frankly. I also purchased for my kind Mother a black bonnet with ribbands and othe<supplied>[r]</supplied> equipments which the people engaged to put into a box &#x26; send by Gavin Johnston the Annan Carrier. I hope she will accept of it for my sake who owe her so much. It is directed to the care of Robert Brand Lockerby. I enclose you a draught for &#xa3;15, which you will know how to dispose of. It is not likely that I shall feel any want of it at present, and no one can have a better right to it than you. My prospects in this place are far from brilliant at present. About a month before I went away, a body had established himself in my neighbourhood &#x26; taken up a school, but could make next to nothing of it. During the vacation however he seems to have succeeded in getting most of my scholars&#x2014;and today I mustered only 12. This will never do. The people&#x2019;s rage for novelty is the cause of it, I suppose, for the poor creature is very ignorant, <pb id="pg-01-141" n="01:141"/>&#x26; very much given to drink. I make no doubt I could reestablish the school, but the fact is I am very much tired of the trade, and very anxious to find some other way of making my bread, and this is as good a time for trying it as another. Irving is going away too, and I shall have no associate in the place at all. I think I could find private teaching perhaps about Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to support me till I could fall into some other way of doing.

<salute>My dear Mitchell,</salute>
<p>About a week ago, I received a letter from the Magistrates of this burgh (which letter I even now use as a blot-sheet), accepting my &#x2018;resignation of the Teacher of the Grammar school,&#x2019; as their phrase goes: and in a fortnight, I shall quit my present situation. Although I relate this event so abruptly, my part in it has not been performed without mature deliberation. You shall hear it all.&#x2014; The miseries of school teaching were known long before the time of the second Dionysius,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dionysius the Younger of Syracuse, after proving himself to be a despotic ruler, was driven from his throne and taken to Corinth in <date>344 or 343 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date> He had earlier invited Plato to come to Syracuse as his tutor but had soon dismissed him.</note> who opened shop, in the city of Corinth, about the middle of the fourth century before Christ. Lucian<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Greek satirist and wit of the <date>second century <hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi></date></note> (the Voltaire of antiquity) has left his opinion, in writing, that when the Gods have determined <pb id="pg-01-142" n="01:142"/>to render a man ridiculously miserable, they make a schoolmaster of him; and an experience of more than four years does not, in my own case, authorise me to contradict this assertion. But of late, the loss of my companions (Irving, who left us last Saturday, and Pears, who will depart in ten days), together with some convincing pro<supplied>[ofs of]</supplied> unpopularity, have given, to my reflections on this subject, a complexion more serious than ordinary. I have thought much and long of the irksome drudgery&#x2014;the solitude&#x2014;the gloom of my condition. I reasoned thus&#x2014; These things may be endured, if not with a peaceful heart, at least with a serene countenance: but it is worth while to enquire whether the profit will repay the pain of enduring them. A scanty and precarious livelihood constitutes the profit; you know me, and can form some judgement of the pain. But there is loss as well as pain. I speak not of the loss of health: but the destruction of benevolent feeling, that searing of the heart, which misery, especially of a petty kind, sooner or later, will never fail to effect&#x2014;is a more frightful thing. The desire, which, in common with all men, I feel for conversation and social intercourse, is, I find, enveloped in a dense repulsive atmosphere &#x2014;not of vulgar <foreign><hi rend="italic">mauvaise honte</hi></foreign> [false shame], tho&#x2019; such it is generally esteemed&#x2014;but of deeper feelings, which I partly inherit from Nature, and which are mostly due to the undefined station I have hitherto occupied in society. If I continue a schoolmaster, I fear there is little reason to doubt that these feelings will increase, and at last drive me entirely from the kindly sympathies of life, to brood in silence over the bitterness into which my friendly propensities must be changed. Where <hi rend="italic">then</hi> would be my comfort? Had I lived at Athens, in the plastic days of that brilliant commonwealth, I might have purchased &#x2018;a narrow paltry tub,&#x2019; and pleased myself with uttering gall among them of Cynosarges.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like Diogenes. Norton says that some believe the word <hi rend="italic">cynic</hi> is derived from Cynosarges, the gymnasium outside Athens where Antisthenes taught in the <date>fourth century <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date></note> But in these times&#x2014;when political institutions and increased civilization have fixed the texture of society&#x2014;when Religion has the privelege of prescribing principles of conduct, from which it is a crime to dissent&#x2014;when, therefore, the aberrations of philosophical enthusiasm are rewarded not by admiration but contempt&#x2014;when Plato would be dissected in the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> review, and Diogenes laid hold of by a &#x2018;society for the suppression of beggars&#x2019;&#x2014;in these times&#x2014;it may not be. But this cure, or any other that I know of, not being applicable&#x2014;it were better to avoid the disease. <hi rend="italic">Therefore I must cease to <pb id="pg-01-143" n="01:143"/>be a paedagogue.</hi> The question is now reduced within a narrower compass. It remains only to enquire at what time I can quit this employment, with the greatest chance of finding another. But how, except by some brisk sally, am I likely ever to emerge from my thraldom? Scantily supplied with books&#x2014;without a rival or a comarade in the pursuit of any thing scientific,&#x2014;little can be atcheived in that direction. With none here even to <hi rend="italic">shew</hi> me the various ways of living in the world, much less to help me into any of them&#x2014;reduced to contemplate the busy scene of life, through the narrow aperture of printed books, Danoetas being judge, I have a right, metaphorically speaking, to be his great Apollo; inasmuch as I have found and occupied that station, where the space of heaven extends not more than three ells.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Dic, quibus in terris (et eris mihi magnus Apollo) tris pateat Caeli spatium non amplius ulnas&#x201D;</hi></foreign>: &#x201C;Tell me in what lands&#x2014;and you shall be my great Apollo&#x2014; Heaven&#x2019;s space is but three ells wide&#x201D; (Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Eclogues</hi>, III, 104&#x2013;5). Damoetas, a herdsman in pastoral poetry, is the name of a shepherd and teacher in Milton&#x2019;s &#x201C;Lycidas.&#x201D;</note> The brightest of my days too are flying fast over my head; and the sooner I resolve, the better. Besides at this time (that of Irving&#x2019;s departure) I give my employers the fittest opportunity to erect an institution for education, that may end their woes on that head&#x2014;which, for the last six years, have been neither few nor small. In short the present is the time.&#x2014; And I wrote my demission on the <date when="1818-10-23">23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of October</date> accordingly.&#x2014; After receiving the answer above alluded to, the business seemed to be done; when on Monday last, a certain very kind &#x26; worthy banker, Mr Swan,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Swan, born in Leven (d. <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>), went to Kirkcaldy and became a prosperous yarn merchant and shipowner. He was three times a provost and later a banker. He married Margaret Hutchison of Wemyss (d. <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>) and had eight children, of whom four died in early childhood. Patrick Don, the eldest (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889-00-00">89</date>), was taught by Irving and then by Carlyle, who also tutored him privately. After Carlyle left Kirkcaldy, Provost Swan kept in touch with him, smuggling German books for him in bales of flax from Holland, and asked his advice about Patrick. When the boy was sent to university, Carlyle gave him tuition in Edinburgh. The two remained friends for life. See <hi rend="italic">Patrick Don Swan</hi> (Kirkcaldy, <date when="1895-00-00">1895</date>), by an unknown author.</note> attended by another person, came to ask me, whether if they could offer me a salary between &#xa3;120 and &#xa3;150, for teaching, in a private capacity, some 30 scholars, I would not be induced to remain another year among them. Upon m<supplied>[y]</supplied> signifying an assent, they left me to pro<supplied>[cure]</supplied> subscribers, I suppose; and I have heard no more of their proceedings. But for this proposal, the probable success of which I cannot estimate, and do not rate highly&#x2014;Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is certainly my destination for the winter<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-144" n="01:144"/>I have calculated that, with oeconomy, I can live there for two years; independently of private teaching, which however I should not refuse, if as is not likely, it should offer itself. During that period, if I do not study, I deserve to continue ignorant. Mineralogy is to be my winter&#x2019;s work. I have thought of writing for Booksellers. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Risum teneas</hi></foreign> [Hold your laughter];<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Echo of Horace&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">De Arte Poetica</hi>, I, 5.</note> for <hi rend="italic">at times</hi> I am serious in this matter. In fine weather it does strike me that there are in this head some ideas, a few <foreign><hi rend="italic">disjecta membra</hi></foreign> [dismembered parts],<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Invenias etiam disjecti membra poetae&#x201D;</hi></foreign>: &#x201C;You will find the limbs of the poet, even though dismembered&#x201D; (see Horace, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>, I, iv, 62).</note> which might find admittance into some one of the many publications of the day. To live by authorship was never my intention. It is said not to be common at present, and happily so: for if we may credit Biographers the least miserable day of an Author&#x2019;s life is generally the last.</p>
<lg><l>&#x2014;Sad cure! for who would lose,</l>
<l>Though full of pain, this intellectual being,</l>
<l>Those thoughts that wander through eternity,</l>
<l>To perish rather, swallowed up and lost</l>
<l>In the wide womb of uncreated night</l>
<l>Devoid of sense and motion?&#x2014;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 146&#x2013;51.</note></l></lg>
 <p>I have meditated an attempt upon the professi<supplied>[on of]</supplied> a lawyer or of a civil engineer; tho what person would afford me any assistance in executing either of these projects, I cannot say. It is doubtful, if I can even learn the nature of the obstacles to be overcome, and the recompense of success. This is the most provoking thing of all: yet how to remedy it? I have thought of asking Mr Duncan for an introduction to some of his friends in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;who might <hi rend="italic">inform</hi> me at least upon these points, help me to get books&#x2014;and shew me countenance in other ways that might not interfere with their own convenience. Tell me what you think of this. But do not mention it to Mr D&#x2014;he might regard it as an opening of the first parallell: and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would be a mistake. When (if ever) I shall have convinced myself, that it is right to overcome the scruples which one naturally feels against asking such a favour, for the first time in one&#x2019;s life,&#x2014;I shall wish to execute the task, without any (unnecessary) meanness. The Minister<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rev. J. Martin, whose daughter would marry Edward Irving.</note> here is <supplied>[a]</supplied> worthy, kind man: but he has been beset with similar applications; and I cannot trouble him. Last time I was in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I called at Professor <pb id="pg-01-145" n="01:145"/>Christison&#x2019;s,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Prof. Alexander Christison, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18150621-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1815-06-21">21 June 1815</date></ref>.</note> with full purpose of talking to him upon this subject: but the good man was already environed with a crowd of hungry schoolmasters. I felt for myself&#x2014; and made my exit in half an hour; tho&#x2019; not till he had expounded the views of Messieurs Dufieff &#x26; Sanabbier, and discussed the merits of Sir James M'Intosh, the King, the late L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Hopetoun, Dr Parr, the Calton-hill observatory,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Mackintosh (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date><corr>; <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17620"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref></corr>), Scottish writer and politician.

See <hi rend="italic">DNB</hi> for both</sic>. The new Calton Hill Observatory was founded <date when="1818-04-25">25 April 1818</date>.</note> with twenty other things, in a way, which (no offense to the General) I could not think very edifying. Mr Leslie has already befriended me; I must allow him to &#x2018;pursue the labyrinths of Physical research,&#x2019; without molestation. Yet without some such interference, I must be contented with <hi rend="italic">angel&#x2019;s visits</hi><note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2026; its visits / Like those of angels, short and far between&#x201D; (Robert Blair, <hi rend="italic">The Grave</hi>, II. 588&#x2013;89).</note> to the College library&#x2014;and my society <supplied>[must con]</supplied>sist of private Teachers &#x26; probationers&#x2014;a class of creatures (I speak it with a sigh) not the [several words torn away] in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Their ideas are silly &#x26; grovelling&#x2014;their minds unvisited by any generous sentiment <supplied>[; I love them not; and]</supplied> of course the feeling will be mutual.</p>
 <p>You see, my boy, that my prospects are not the brightest in Nature. Yet what shall we say? Contentment, that little practised virtue, has been inculcated by saint, by savage and by sage&#x2014;and by each from a different principle. Do not fear that I shall read you a homily on that hackneyed theme. Simply I wish to tell you, that in days of darkness&#x2014;for there <hi rend="italic">are</hi> days when my support (pride or whatever it is) has enough to do&#x2014;I find it useful to remember that Cleanthes, whose <figure><graphic url="g1-7.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure><note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Read <figure><graphic url="g1-8.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure> (Prof. William Willis&#x2019; note). <hi rend="italic">Hymn to God</hi>, i.e., the <hi rend="italic">Hymn to Zeus</hi>.</note> may last yet <supplied>[an]</supplied>other two thousand years, never murmured, when he laboured by night, as a street porter, that he might hear the lectures of Zero, by day; and that Epictetus, the ill-used slave of a cruel tyrant&#x2019;s as wretched minion, wrote that <figure><graphic url="g1-9.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure> [<hi rend="italic">Enchiridion</hi>] which may fortify the soul of the latest inhabitant of Earth.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cleanthes was a Greek Stoic philosopher of the <date>third century <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date> Zeno was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy in the early part of the <date>third century <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date> Epictetus, a Greek slave, was a great teacher of Stoic philosophy in Rome in the first century <hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi> His teachings are known only through the <hi rend="italic">Enchiridion</hi>, a condensed version of his philosophy made by his pupil Arrian.</note> Besides tho&#x2019; neither of these men had adorned their species&#x2014;it is morally certain, that our earthly joys or griefs can <pb id="pg-01-146" n="01:146"/>last but a few brief years; and tho&#x2019; the latter were eternal, complaint and despondency could neither mitigate their intensity nor shorten their duration. Therefore my duty, and that of every man, on this p<supplied>[oint, is]</supplied> clear as light itself.</p>
<p>Excuse, my dear Mitchell, the egotism of this almost interminable letter. I have few other friends before whom I can unfold my secret soul. Do not say, with the French wit, <foreign><hi rend="italic">on aime mieux dire du mal de soi-m&#xEA;me, que de n'en point parler</hi></foreign> [one prefers to speak ill of one&#x2019;s self rather than not to talk about one&#x2019;s self at all]. Regard this rather as an <hi rend="italic">auricular confession</hi>, intended to answer, with other purposes, that of marshalling my own reasons for my conduct&#x2014;that I may be the better able to meet the result, whatever it be, with a resolute spirit.</p>
<p>I have left myself no room for criticism (falsely so called), or remarks upon your interesting letter. How fully I participate in your feelings with regard to the men of Cambridge will appear from the foregoing pages. Yet never despair.

<salute>My Dear Mitchell,</salute>
<p>Those who have never known what it is to buffet with Fortune, and to hear the voice of a friend encouraging them in the strife, cannot understand the pleasure which I felt from reading your letter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell had written in his letter of <date when="1818-11-20">20 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I congratulate you my dear Carlyle on your escape from the thraldom of paedagogy&#x2014; The wide world is now before you&#x2014;chuse your employment apply to it with energy and there is no fear of want of Success.&#x2014; I know nothi<supplied>[n]</supplied>g at all of the business of a civil engineer<supplied>[.]</supplied> I am acquainted with none of that profession&#x2014;nor do I know any thing of the labour or Reward&#x2014; I should be apt to think however that it is none of the most profitable unless a Concurrence of lucky accidents place you in the Rank of a Jessop or a Telford. &#x2026; I was not at all surprised at your idea of writing for the Booksellers&#x2014; The plan I think is a good one&#x2014;that of being a lawyer still better&#x2014;and both <hi rend="italic">united</hi> will do admirably. &#x2026; You have seen I dare say a prospectus published by Waugh &#x26; Innes (formerly Oliphant Waugh &#x26; Innes) of a <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Monthly Review&#x2019;</hi> which they intend commencing immediately if not already begun&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> D<supplied>[uncan]</supplied> is very well acquainted with the Baillie (Waugh) &#x26; they have had some correspondence I understand on the subject of this Review. The short &#x26; the long of the story is that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> D. wrote to Waugh recommending you as a powerful auxill<supplied>[i]</supplied>ary. &#x2026; our good Minister <supplied>[Duncan also]</supplied> wrote an epistle recommendatory to Brewster on your behalf&#x2014; The style of it much the same as the preceding. &#x2026; Writers for the Encyclopaedia are paid very well&#x2014;3 or 4 Guineas a sheet I am told. &#x2026; Would you like an Introduction <supplied>[to]</supplied> John. I. Henderson Advocate Nicholson&#x2019;s Square to give you some idea of law.&#x201D;</note> It found me on the eve of my departure from Kirkcaldy. The plan of a subscription-school was, according to my expectation, given up for want of subscribers. I was packing my clothes and books, writing directions, settling accompts,&#x2014;weighing anchor, in short, to venture once again with little ballast, provision or experience, upon the stormy ocean of life; when your admonitions came to shed a gleam of light athwart my rough and doubtful course. I thank you for them, with all my soul. <pb id="pg-01-148" n="01:148"/>If I have not done it sooner, or if I do it now in a clumsy way&#x2014;I desire you to consider the trouble and vexation which a change of place and habits produces; and if this excuse will not satisfy you, add to it, that for some days I have enjoyed very poor health, which two ounces of sulphate of magnesia that I swallowed some hours ago, have not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> tended to diminish.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the beginning of Carlyle&#x2019;s lifelong stomach ailment, which he afterward dated from <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>.</note></p>
<p>It would be ridiculous to affect displeasure at your kind violation of my prohibition. You have acted towards me as became a friend. To Mr Duncan, who possesses the rare talent of conferring obligations without wounding the vanity of him who receives them,&#x2014;and the still rarer disposition to exercise that talent&#x2014;all gratitude is due on my part. It is needless to say more about my feelings upon this head. With regard to the abilities which you are kind enough to suppose that I possess for writing in Reviews and Encyclopaedias&#x2014;I have much doubt: I have very little, respecting the alacrity with which I should engage in these enterprises. At all events, I am highly indebted for what has already been done in that matter; and shall receive with great thankfulness the introductory letters which you mention. The countenance and conversation of such a person as Dr Brewster<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190223-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1819-02-23">23 Feb. 1819</date></ref>.</note> cannot fail to be both gratifying and instructive to one in my circumstances. If I mistake not, I have seen Mr Henderson<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201206-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1820-12-06">6 Dec. 1820</date></ref>.</note> at Ruthwell-manse. His manners seemed to be such as become a gentleman. The information which might be derived from him, concerning the profession of law, is what I earnestly desire.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are curious to know the state of my feelings&#x2014;at this crisis of m<supplied>[y affairs]</supplied>. I need not use many words to describe them. Conceive to yourself a person of my stamp (about which you should know something before this time), loosened from all his engagements with mankind&#x2014;seated in a small room in S.

The contrast between this hirsute person and the double-refined travelling tutor was what Mr E. himself would have called <foreign><hi rend="italic">magnifique</hi></foreign>. I thought of the little lap-dog, the dog of knowledge, which I had seen dancing in a ring with the rugged russian bear. Esbie seem<supplied>[s]</supplied> to have some good nature&#x2014;and as his vanity, which is very considerable, lies quite in a different direction from one&#x2019;s own vanity (which in most cases is also considerable), he is, I should think, rather amusing than otherwise. To-day I saw him enter the college-yard&#x2014;&#x201C;and surely there never lighted upon this earth, which he scarcely seemed to touch, a more beauteous vision. I then thought (to continue, in the words of Burke) that ten thousand swords (fists rather) would have leapt from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened him with insult<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Reflections on the Revolution in France</hi> (London, <date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>), pp. 112&#x2013;13.</note>&#x2014; But alas!&#x201D; poor Esbie must be content, he thinks, <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;with some devil of a curacy&#x2019;</hi> as he calls it; tho&#x2019; his acquaintance with &#x2018;the first houses in England&#x2019; is of the most intimate nature.</p>

He is one of those persons whose understanding is overburthened by their memory. Destitute of <pb id="pg-01-150" n="01:150"/>accurate science, without comprehension of mind,&#x2014;he details a chaos of facts, which he accounts for in a manner as slovenly as he selects and arranges them.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
 <p>I expected that the Carrier would have been here before this time, and that consequently I should have had it in my power to give you notice of my condition, without putting you to the expense of postage. But as there is now little probability of his arriving this week, I can no longer delay to answer the letter which I received from my Father a considerable time ago. Few things in the world could give me greater pleasure than to learn that you are all in good health, and that your affairs are in a somewhat prosperous condition. I trust they still continue so. The boys deserve my thanks for the alacrity with which they explored the condition of that same unfortunate box. I call it unfortunate, for upon calling at the person Kay&#x2019;s in the Grass-market here, I found it ill-used in every particular. In the first place, tho&#x2019; the carriage, as appeared by the marks upon the lid, had been paid&#x2014;the poor dog Beck had contrived to make Kay (as a Porter testified) pay it again, inadvertently&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> stoutly refused to part with it, unless he were reimbursed. This, by the way, was the reason why it had never come to Kirk<supplied>[c]</supplied>aldy; all the carriers refusing to take it because they must first pay the carriage to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> which was marked as paid already. So the poor box was left standing for six weeks, in a damp cellar, without any one to claim it. I was forced to comply with Signor Kay&#x2019;s requisition&#x2014;and upon paying him the 2/10, had my articles brought home at last. The socks fit me well, and altogether are admirable things. The butter also was there undamaged: but the shirts&#x2014;which your kindness had incited you to make for me&#x2014;those shirts I was enraged to find all spotted &#x26; sprinkled with a black colour&#x2014;which the body Davie here says is <foreign><hi rend="italic">mellemdew</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Mellemdew</hi>, &#x201C;a nonce-form of mildew,&#x201D; from Old English <hi rend="italic">melland</hi> (mouldy), cited once only, from this letter, in the <hi rend="italic">Scottish National Dictionary</hi>.</note>&#x2014;and which will never come out, according to the same authority. I have had them washed; but the blackness remains. Much of it is about the breast and if it be true that it cannot be erased, I must make night-shirts of them. This cannot <pb id="pg-01-152" n="01:152"/>be remedied, and therefore ought not to be regretted; but the creature Smith should refund his carriage-money at the least. I find living here very high. An hour ago, I paid my week&#x2019;s bill which tho&#x2019; 15/2 was the smallest of the three which I have yet discharged. This is an unreasonable sum when I consider the slender accom<supplied>[m]</supplied>odation, and the paltry ill-cooked morsel which is my daily pittance. There is also a schoolmaster right over my head, whose noisy brats give me at times no small annoyance. On a given night of the week, he also assembles a select number of vocal performers, whose <hi rend="italic">music</hi> (as they charitably name it) is now and then so clamourous, that (when studying a Mathematical theorem) I almost wished the throats of these sweet singers, full of molten lead, or any other substance which might stop their braying, for the time. Yet neither can <hi rend="italic">this</hi> be avoided. I was through about 50 rooms the other day&#x2014;only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> was offered cheaper and that greatly inferior&#x2014; So I shall be content till the spring. There is nothing very tragical in all this: yet it is the worst side of the picture. I ought not to forget, that I am more healthy than I have been this twelvemonth. I have plenty of time to read, and am not destitute of good society&#x2014;that of Irving&#x2014;James Brown a truly good lad, who was at Mainhill once&#x2014;Francis Dixon &#x26;c. Also I have <hi rend="italic">three hours</hi> of private teaching&#x2014;at two guineas a month for each hour. The first two hours I got 3 weeks ago. A young man had been directed to Irving to get lessons in Astronomy&#x2014; Irving not finding it convenient to supply him, sent him to me: and I engaged immediately. His name is Robertson<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note>&#x2014;he is an officer in the East India comp<hi rend="italic">y</hi> and I find him a pleasant youth. I am only sorry that he must leave this place, in a short time, and thus cut off my salary. The other hour, which I undertook ten days ago, is devoted to teach Geometry to an old English (or Jersey) Gentleman, called Saumarez, who asked Irving one day in the Natural history class, which I also attend, if he could recommend a mathematical teacher&#x2014;and was immediately introduced to me. He is a most amusing creature&#x2014;and the space between 8 and 9 o&#x2019;clock which I daily spend with him, no less than the arguments we have together in the class, about Newton and natural philosophy&#x2014;is often the most diverting of the day&#x2014; He lives at the north end of the new town, above a mile from this place; and this walk for me, before breakfast (which is of porridge) is another advantage. Robertson lives with his mother, much in the same quarter&#x2014;I go thither between 10 and twelve o&#x2019;clock. Then comes a walk with Brown or Dixon&#x2014;or else a bout at reading <pb id="pg-01-153" n="01:153"/>till two; next the natural history class till 3; then dinner of fish or mutton &#x26; roots;&#x2014;and reading till midnight. This is a picture of my life; and notwithstanding a fair proportion of anticipations &#x26; forebodings, I am not at all uncomfortable. I saw the Professor Leslie twice or thrice, since I wrote to you. He requested me to attempt a most difficult problem which he was going to put into a book that he is publishing. He had not time for it himself. I wrought at it for a week; and, notwithstanding several advances, could not do it. The Day before yesterday, he advised me to let it alone a while&#x2014;which I was willing to do; and then to try it again, which I also intend to do. &#x201C;Upon the whole,&#x201D; said this curious philosopher, &#x201C;I see nothing so eligible for you as to learn the engineer business; and then go <hi rend="italic">to America</hi>&#x2014; Great business there&#x2014; Swiss Gentleman, went lately&#x2014;making a large fortune&#x2014;many bridges and canals&#x2014; I must have you introduced to Jardine.&#x201D; This Jardine<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Jardine (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), engineer, constructed the Union Canal, and was the first to determine the mean level of the sea. See <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14661"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>.</note> is an engineer of this city; and came from Millhousebridge near Lochmaben&#x2014;report says he is a conceited disagre<supplied>[e]</supplied>able person. You will start, My dear Mother, at the sound of America. I too had much rather live in my own country; and lay my bones in the soil which covers those of my Fathers. Nor do I despair of getting a comfortable situation, for the exercise of my talents&#x2014;somewhere within this sea-girt isle. On monday I received a letter from Mr Duncan of Ruthwell<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200126-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1820-01-26">26 Jan. 1820</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;containing three notes of introduction &#x2014;one to a certain Bailie Waugh, a bookseller of this place who wishes to employ me as a writer in some <hi rend="italic">review</hi> which he is about to commence. I had half an hour&#x2019;s pleasant chat with this Bailie, left my address with him, and went on my way. What the upshot may be I cannot guess. A second letter I delivered to Dr Brewster, Editor of the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Encyclopaedia. He received me kindly&#x2014;took my address&#x2014;talked with me a while on several subjects&#x2014;and let me go. The kind Minister of Ruthwell had, I understand, written about getting me to write in the Encyclopaedia&#x2014;the Dr said nothing on that head. No matter. The third letter is to J. A. Henderson Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Advocate, which I have not yet delivered. Perhaps he will inform me about the lawyer business. This law I sometimes think is what I was intended for naturally<supplied>[.]</supplied> I am afraid it takes several hundreds to become an Advocate. But for <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, I should commence the study of it with great hopes of success. We shall see whether it is possible. One of the first Advocates of the day, <pb id="pg-01-154" n="01:154"/>Forsyth,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Forsyth (<date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00"><sic>1846</sic><corr>1845</corr></date>), lawyer and author. See <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9930"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>.</note> raised himself from being a disconsolate Preacher to his present eminence. Therefore I entreat you, My Mother, not to be any way uneasy about me. I see none of my fellows with whom I am very anxious to change places. They are mostly older than I by several years&#x2014;and have as dim prospects generally as need be&#x2014; Tell the boys to <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, and not to let their hearts be troubled for me. Tell them, I am a stubborn dog&#x2014;and evil fortune shall not break my heart&#x2014;or bend it either, as I hope. I must write to them and to my Father before long.</p>
<p>I know not how to speak about the washing which you offer so kindly. Surely you thought, five years ago, that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> troublesome washing and baking was all over; and <hi rend="italic">now</hi> to recommence! I can scarcely think of troubling you&#x2014; Yet the clothes are ill washed here, and if the box be going and coming any way&#x2014;perhaps you could manage it.</p>
<p>The report of several mournful accidents has reached me from Annandale. Sam<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Richardson, Preacher&#x2019;s mother has been burnt to death in her own house in your neighborhood! melancholy for poor Samuel! Old Johnston of Ha'bank has at length it would appear, ended his brutal career upon the floor of an alehouse! A shocking lesson to the drunkards of that district. A nephew &#x26; namesake of Dick Graham&#x2019;s of Annan expired here of a fever, which he had been labouring under in the south, and which a ride hither on the roof of the coach brought back with new vigour. He was my school-fellow&#x2014;and junior. I mourn for his untimely fate. These things tell me, and every one, loudly, to remember that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is not the place of our rest. Why then repine at the poor events of this fleeting life? A few brief years, and the unmeasured periods of eternity shall pass over us forever&#x2014; Be <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> also ready<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 24:44.</note>&#x2014;each of us ought to say for himself&#x2014; But my paper is done. I add only, that with a heartfelt wish for the happiness of you all, I remain My Dear Mother,</p>

<p>I wish from my soul some less laborious mode of friendly intercourse could be devised than letter-writing. Much may be done in the flight of ages; I despair of steam indeed, notwithstanding its felicitous application to many useful purposes, but who can limit the undiscovered agent with which knowledge is yet to enrich philanthropy? Charming prospect for the dull, above all, the solitary dull, of future times; small comfort for us, however, who, in no great fraction of one age, shall need to care nothing about the matter.</p>

<p>Before my departure from Kirkcaldy I had commenced a letter intended for your perusal: but avocations, necessary or not, interrupted me; and the <date when="1819-11-25">twenty-fifth of November</date> found it still unfinished. Since that period I have crossed the frith, and undergone, with murmuring not loud but deep, the manifold vexations to which a life such as mine is liable. I might have written to you, some months ago; but my daily intention has been frustrated by those innumerable trifles which cramp the movements of indolent men&#x2014;those trifles which of late, during many weeks, deprived me of the pleasure of hearing from yourself. However ridiculous it may appear, I cannot help regretting yet again, that we should write so seldom. To a man who has few friends, and most people have fewer than they suspect, real sympathy is doubly valuable. Amid the buffettings of fortune, a letter from a true friend is like an oasis in the desart of selfishness wherewith this Earth is filled. Why then, I ask it with some anger against us both, why should we write to one another so very seldom?</p>
<p>I am grieved to observe your embryo resolution of going to America.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnston had written to Carlyle on <date when="1818-10-27">27 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I shall leave this place in the spring, and as I have no other in view in this country I imagine I must cross the Atlantic and try my fate in America. I have been thinking seriously of this of late and suppose it will be my destiny<supplied>[.]</supplied> Were it not for the few friends I have I think I could leave Scotland without much regret.&#x201D;</note> <pb id="pg-01-156" n="01:156"/>It is always a mournful thing to leave our country; to a man of sensibility &#x26; reflection it is dreadful. I speak not of that feeling which must freeze the soul of an emigrant, when, landing on the quay of Boston or New York, he reflects that the wide Atlantic is roaring between him and every heart that cares for his fate. But to snap asunder, <hi rend="italic">for ever</hi>, the associations that bind us to our native soil; to forget the Hampdens, the Sydneys, the Lockes, the Stewarts the Burnses,&#x2014;or to remember them only as men of a foreign land; to change our ideas of human excellence; to have our principles our prejudices supplanted; to endure the rubs which hard unkindness will have in store for us; to throw aside old friendships, and with a seared heart to seek for new ones&#x2014;all this is terrible. And after all what would you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> there? To teach is misery in the old world or the new: and perhaps (if it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be so) England is as fair a field for it as the Union. I entreat you, my dear friend, to lay aside this enterprise&#x2014;at least for the present. I look upon emigration as a fearful destiny&#x2014; Not more fearful, I grant, than others that might be imagined; than such failure, for instance, as might call forth the pity of those who love us (I was about to add&#x2014;and the triumph of those who hate us: but it is a paltry sentiment to care for <hi rend="italic">that</hi>;&#x2014;if it exist within me I would wish to hide it both from you &#x26; myself); but thank Heaven things are not yet come to this. Consider the talents you possess&#x2014;the classical, scientific, historical&#x2014;above all the agricultural knowledge, which you have acquired; look around you; continue to improve your mind in patience, and do not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> imagine that, in our own country, the gates of preferment are shut against you. It will give satisfaction to me, and perhaps some relief to your own mind, to have your situation and views distinctly explained in your next letter. Write to me without reserve&#x2014;as to one who can be indifferent to nothing which concerns you.</p>
<p>It is superfluous to say that I have bid farewell to Fife. My resolution was taken without advice, because none was to be had; but not without long &#x26; serious meditation. I could not leave Kirkcaldy but with regret. There are in it many persons of a respectable&#x2014;several of an exemplary character; and had the tie which united us been of a less irritating nature, my time might have been spent very happily among them. At present my prospects are as dim, and my feelings of course <pb id="pg-01-157" n="01:157"/>nearly as uncomfortable, as they have been at any period of my life. About the end of <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>, I remember informing you, that, in the space of two years, my views of human life had considerably altered. A similar period has again elapsed, and brought with it a change less marked indeed, but not less real. Till not very long ago, I imagined my whole duty to consist in thinking and enduring. It now appears that I ought not only to suffer but to act. Connected with mankind by sympathies &#x26; wants which experience never ceases to reveal&#x2014;I now begin to perceive that it is impossible to attain the Solitary happiness of the Stoic&#x2014;and hurtful if it were possible&#x2014; How far the creed of Epictetus<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18181106-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1818-11-06">6 Nov. 1818</date></ref>.</note> may require to be modified, it is not easy to determine; that <supplied>[it]</supplied> is defective seems pretty evident. I quit the stubborn dogma, with a regret heightened almost to remorse; and feel it to be a desire rather than a duty to mingle in the busy current which is flowing past me, and to act my part before the not distant day arrive, when they who seek me shall not find me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><foreign>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Rien ne doit tant diminuer la satisfaction que nous avons de nous-m&#xEA;mes, que de voir que nous d&#xE9;sapprouvons dans un tem</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">p</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">s ce que nous approuvions dans un autre&#x2019;</hi></foreign> [&#x2018;Nothing should diminish our satisfaction with ourselves so much as to see ourselves disapprove at one time what we approved at another&#x2019; (<hi rend="italic">R&#xE9;flexions ou sentences et maximes morales</hi> [<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>], I, 51&#x2013;52).]&#x2014;Is the unpleasant but faithful observation of La Rochefoucault&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note, inserted with an asterisk here).</note> <hi rend="italic">What</hi> part I shall act is still a mystery. The four hours of private teaching, which I mentioned to Mitchell, diminished in a day to two, and altogether ceased a fortnight ago. At present I am giving lessons in Geometry, one hour per day, to Mr Saumarez, an old gentleman of Guernsey, whose disbelief in Newton, against whom he has written a book, together with his admirable notions about light &#x26; pressure, might amuse me, if I were in a more joyful humour. A competent quantity of <hi rend="italic">hours</hi> (such is the cant phrase) might, I have not much doubt, be procured, if the usual measures were adopted;&#x2014;but it will hardly do.&#x2014; Several weeks ago, I received Mr Duncan&#x2019;s introductory letters&#x2014;a favour which I reckon among the few acts of disinterested kindness that have been conferred upon me in this world. You will believe that the delivery of them was a new scene for me. I went through it however with great <foreign><hi rend="italic">sang froid</hi></foreign>. Frank Dixon says the procedure in these cases is quite regular. You are received with a bow&#x2014;the weather is discussed, and the merits of the last review&#x2014;then you retire; sometime after which you are invited to breakfast, and here the acquaintance terminates. I received a polite reception from all my new friends. Dr Brewster is the only one whom I have seen a <pb id="pg-01-158" n="01:158"/>second time. He has very much the air of a kind man.&#x2014; Would I had some employment! My mind lies toward the law; but much capital is requisite for obtaining a gown, and many years are often spent in waiting for employment&#x2014; Yet it is a fair field with no favour, and were it not for the first objection I would attempt it instantly. Some weeks ago I met Professor Leslie on the street; and after discussing the hard fate which his curves of the second order were undergoing from the blockhead of an engraver&#x2014;&#x2018;upon the whole&#x2019; said the philosopher &#x2018;the best plan for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> seems to be to learn the engineer business, and go to America.

Waugh and Innes were Edinburgh booksellers and publishers, formerly Oliphant, Waugh and Innes. &#x201C;A heavy pompous man of words,&#x201D; Edward Irving called Waugh in a letter (MS: NLS, 1764.202). The Rev. Henry Duncan of Ruthwell had given Carlyle a letter of introduction to Waugh. Waugh and Innes published Murray&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Literary History of Galloway</hi>.</note> is before the public. It would be rash i<supplied>[n]</supplied> me to decide upon its merits&#x2014;especially before reading it attentively<supplied>[.]</supplied> The slight look which I gave it did not certainly, any more than the prospectus, impress me with a lofty idea of the brethren&#x2019;s energy. But time will try.</p>
<p>With regard to reading, you would think I have enough of time upon my hands at present: yet the truth is, I have often read more, almost never studied less! I have no enthusiasm&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">cui bono</hi></foreign>? I always ask myself. It would be irksome, &#x26; impossible, in this state of my sheet, to criticise the elegant and ingenious rather than powerful or philosophic narrative which Horace Ben&#xE9;dict Saussure gives of his journeys in the Alps.

<salute>My dear friend,</salute>
<p>Altho&#x2019; well aware of the propensity, which exists in men, to speak more about themselves than others care for hearing, yet, as you have hitherto been the participator of all my scheme<supplied>[s]</supplied>, I venture to solicit your forbearance and advice, at a time when I need them as much perhaps as I have ever done.</p>
<p>My situation may be briefly explained. All the plans that I have formed for succeeding in any profession, have involved the idea of subsisting in the interim by writing; and every project of this kind which I have devised, up to the present date, has been frustrated by my inability to procure books either for criticising or consulting. I have, it is true, the privilege of appearing on the floor of the college library, to <pb id="pg-01-160" n="01:160"/><hi rend="italic">ask</hi> for any book,&#x2014;to wait about an hour, and then to fi<supplied>[nd it&#x2014;not in.]</supplied> But this is of small advantage. My private teaching came to an end about a month <supplied>[ago and]</supplied> at this time, except a small degree of attention which I pay to the shadow rather than the su<supplied>[bstance]</supplied> of Mineralogy&#x2014;for which science it is perhaps less surprising than unlucky that my unsettled <supplied>[con]</supplied>dition and my indifferent state of health have left me little enthusiasm; excepting also a slight <supplied>[tinc]</supplied>ture of the German language which I am receiving from one Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Jardine of G&#xF6;ttingen (or rather Applegarth),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A parish in Annandale. For Jardine, see also <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190329-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1819-03-29">29 March</date></ref>.</note> in return for an equally slight tincture of the French which I communicate,&#x2014;there is no stated duty whatever for me to perform. The source of that considerable quantity of comfort, which I enjoy, in these circumstances, is twofold. First there is the hope of better days, which I am not yet old and worn enough to have quite laid aside. This cheerful feeling is combined with a portion of the universal quality which we ourselves name firmness, others obstinacy; the quality which I suppose to be the fulcrum of all Stoical philosophy; and which, when the charmer Hope has utterly forsaken us, may afford a grim support in the extreme of wretchedness. But there are other emotions which, at times, arise; when, in my solitary walks around the Meadows or Calton-hill, my mind escapes from the smoke and tarnish of those unfortunate persons, with whom it is too much my fortune to associate&#x2014;emotions which if less fleeting might constitute a principle of action at once rational &#x26; powerful&#x2014; It is difficult to speak upon these subjects without being ridiculous if not hypocritical. Besides, the principles to which I allude, being little else than a more intense perception of certain truths universally acknowledged, to translate them into language would degrade them to the rank of truisms. Therefore unwillingly I leave you to conjecture. It is probable, however, that your good-natured imagination might lead you to overrate my resources if I neglected to inform you that, upon the whole, my mind is far from philosophical composure. The vicissitudes of our opinions do not happen with the celerity or distinctness of an astronomical phenomenon; but it is evident, that my mind, at the present, is undergoing sundry alterations. When I review my past conduct it seems to have been guided by narrow or defective views, and (worst of all) by lurking, deeply-lurking affectation. I could have defended these views by the most paramount logic: but what logic can withstand Experience? This is not the first, and, if I live long, it will not be the last of my revolutions. Thus&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">velut unda supervenit undam</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Just as wave rises upon wave&#x201D; (Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi>, II, ii, 176).</note>&#x2014; <pb id="pg-01-161" n="01:161"/>errour succeeds to errour; and thus while I seek a rule of life&#x2014;life itself is fast flying away. At the last, perhaps my creed may be found too nearly to resemble the memorable Tristrapaedia of Walter Shandy, of which the minute and indubitable directions for Tristram&#x2019;s baby-clothes were finished, when Tristram was in breeches<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laurence Sterne (<date when="1713-00-00">1713</date>&#x2013;<date when="1768-00-00">68</date>), <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi> (<date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>&#x2013;<date when="1767-00-00">67</date>), VI, chap. xviii.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>But I forget the aphorism with which I began my letter. Here at least, let me <supplied>[conclude]</supplied> this longwinded account of my affairs; and request from you as particular an account of your own. We <supplied>[cannot]</supplied> help one another, my friend, but mutual advice and encouragement may easily be given &#x26; thank<supplied>[fu]</supplied>lly received. Will you go to Liverpool or Bristol or anywhither, and institute a classico-mathemat<supplied>[i]</supplied>cal academy? or what say you to that asylum or rather hiding-place for poverty and discontent, America? To be fabricating lock no. 8, among the passes of the Alleg<supplied>[h]</supplied>any!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Canal-making developed later in America than in Europe, but gained impetus finally in attempts to link up the territories in the Allegheny Mountains.

<p>Some nights ago, by the kindness of Dr Brewster, I was present at a meeting of the Royal Society. It is pleasant to see persons met together&#x2014;when their object even <hi rend="italic">professes</hi> to be the pursuit of knowledge. But if any one should expect to find, in George street, an image of the first Royal Society,&#x2014;when Newton was in the chair &#x26; Halley at the table; he cannot (unless his fancy be the stronger) fail of disappointment. He will find indeed a number of clean, well-dressed (some of them able-bodied) men: but in place of witnessing the invention of fluxions or the discovery of gravitation, he may chance to learn the dimensions of a fossil stick, or hear it decided that a certain little crumb of stone is neither to be called mesotype nor Stillbite. This (a critic would say) has very much the look of drivelling&#x2014; But <foreign><hi rend="italic">pauca verba</hi></foreign> [few words]<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Corporal Nym in <hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi>, I, i.</note>&#x2014; Dr B. is said to be almost the only efficient member of this philosophical guild<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Royal Society of Edinburgh dated from <date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>; it was, and still is, at 22 George St. Carlyle&#x2019;s strictures were hardly deserved.</note>&#x2014; I may mention (tho this has nothing earthly to do with it) that I have seen the Dr twice since my first visit; that I have met with a kind reception, and found instruction as well as entertainment in his conversation.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-162" n="01:162"/>In conformity with ancient custom, I ought now to transmit you some account of my studies&#x2014; But I have too much conscience to dilate upon this subject.

But she is gone; and with all her faults she possessed the loftiest soul of any female of her time.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I expected a letter from you, in return for that which I wrote from Kirkcaldy:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >That of <date when="1818-07-28">28 July 1818</date>.</note> but when I consider my own conduct, in that particular, whatever reason I may have to lament, I can have little to complain of my disappointment&#x2014; Except the few &#x26; brief notices, which I receive from our Galloway friends, I have no information respecting your proceedings. It is known to me, only, that you have become a Preacher&#x2014;a popular one, I trust&#x2014;and that you have some thoughts of accepting a charge in the island of Man&#x2014; I sincerely hope that whilst discharging the sacred functions of a Clergyman, you will experience that high satisfaction which a conscientious fulfilment of them is so well calculated to produce&#x2014;</p>
<p>By the date of my letter, it may be seen, that I have quitted Fife&#x2014; I laid down the pedagogic insignia, three months ago, with a resolution not to resume them for a considerable space&#x2014;never, if it shall please Providence&#x2014; Since my arrival in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I have led a miscellaneous, undescribeable life. Studying Mineralogy, for which the wonderful <pb id="pg-01-164" n="01:164"/>lectures of &#x2018;the illustrious Werner&#x2019;s&#x2019; as illustrious
disciple<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prof. Jameson was the first great exponent in Britain of the tenets of Abraham Werner (<date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>), the German geologist, though he was later converted to the opposing views of James Hutton (<date when="1726-00-00">1726</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797-00-00">97</date>).</note> have completely destroyed all my enthusiasm&#x2014; Often reading (not so often studying) all manner of books, from De Sta&#xEB;l to La Lande&#x2014;not to speak of the learned Berzelius<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See

<p>Perhaps I should not have written this letter to-night, had it not occurred to me that in a week, I am to resume the study of Italian, &#x26; that consequently I shall require that little dictionary, which you, last year, borrowed for the use of a friend. If the young lady, in question, have the book in her possession, it will oblige me, to return it as soon as possible: if she have lost it, there is small harm done; for the Dictionary of Signor Graglia<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. A. Graglia, <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of the Italian and English Languages</hi> (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>).

<p>I am sorry that I can send you no &#x2018;literary news.&#x2019; In my present situation, I have little opportunity of receiving any&#x2014; I lead a retired life; and when information of this kind does reach me, it is so tinctured &#x26; diluted by the prejudices or ignorance of those who receive &#x26; transmit it, in the back-shops of Booksellers, or at the teatables of &#x2018;literary ladies&#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An echo of Maria Edgeworth&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Letters for Literary Ladies</hi> (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>), but no doubt a common phrase.</note> and others&#x2014;as to be quite unfit for repitition.

<p><pb id="pg-01-165" n="01:165"/>Last Autumn, at Hitchill, I met with two Misses M'Lean &#x26; their brother&#x2014;relations of Mr Davidson, I believe&#x2014;most pleasant persons&#x2014;no less than Mrs (<hi rend="italic">Norris</hi>?) who was of the party also. If you should ever see any one of them&#x2014;&#x26; if that one should happen to be so kind as remember my name&#x2014;you may give notice, that I still think with satisfaction of those two happy days, and of the amiable people who rendered them so&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was among the lakes too. If you were beside me, I would compel you to sit patiently, till I had described the glories of a summer morning on the peak of Skiddaw&#x2014;and an evening on the Stake of Borrowdale&#x2014; Nor would I forget the fearful precipices that mark the &#x2018;brow of the mighty Helvellyn&#x2019;;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Walter Scott&#x2019;s &#x201C;Hellvellyn&#x201D; (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>), l. 1. The &#x201C;Stake&#x201D; of Borrowdale is a pass between the Langstrath branch of Borrowdale and the Micheldon branch of Longdale.</note>&#x2014;the churchyard of Grassmere; or the echoes of Ulles-water&#x2014;any more than the mysterious answers which our questions received from the boors of that picturesque Country&#x2014; But at present it were foolish to speak of these matters&#x2014; This summer, as my health is indifferent, I intend to pass two months in the country&#x2014; Partly to read German (which I am attempting to learn at present), at My Father&#x2019;s; and partly to refresh my mind with wandering about the country&#x2014; One of my projected tours is to Galloway. This is yet little better than a dream; but it may be realised&#x2014; I wish much to see the Sienite<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A kind of rock, syenite.</note> of your mountains, and, still more, some respected people who live among them. If you be in the Manx country; who knows but we may ascend Snafell<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Snaefell is the highest mountain on the Isle of Man.</note> together! This, as I have said, is but dreaming; yet it is pleasant dreaming; and where is the harm of indulging it? Hope is the soul of life: look back upon the past, where the Charmer is wanting, and see what a wilderness it is!</p>
<p>But the watchmen give lugubrious intelligence, that it is &#x2018;half <supplied>[past]</supplied> one o&#x2019;clock.&#x2019; Therefore I must conclude. You will not fail to write me instantly.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I sit down to write a letter to you, at this late hour of the night; in order to inform you of some steps, which I have taken, since you last heard from me. The uncomfortableness of the person Davie&#x2019;s lodging has been frequently alluded to, in our correspondence. Vermin of various sorts, which haunted the beds of that unfortunate woman, together with sluttishness &#x26; a lying, thievish disposition with which she was afflicted&#x2014;at length became intolerable; and on Wednesday, I told the creature that her &#x2018;ticket-board&#x2019; (fatal signal!), must once more be hoisted&#x2014;in plain words, that I was about to forsake her house entirely. She received the news with considerable dudgeon; but as my words to her were calm &#x26; few as well as emphatic, she made no remonstrance. To secure another room was my next care. John Forrest&#x2019;s place, which has few recommendations except the excellent demeanour of Mrs F., was engaged, I found, till the beginning of <date when="1819-04-00">April</date>. Of the other places, at which I called, some were dirty, others dear, others had a suspicious look; none were suitable. In short not to trouble you with the detail of these pitiful affairs, I saw no better plan than to propose a junction with one Hill (a Nephew of Mrs Irving&#x2019;s&#x2014;Bogside&#x2014;from Panteth Hill, Mousewald), who is here studying law.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The matriculation album for Edinburgh University lists Edward Hill, Mouswald, Dumfriesshire, who enrolled in arts in <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date> and in Scots law in <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>. Mrs. Irving was the wife of George Irving, Edward Irving&#x2019;s uncle. There are some early letters in the NLS from J. Edward Hill to Carlyle. These are often signed &#x201C;Peter Pindar,&#x201D; and in them Carlyle is addressed as &#x201C;Jonathan&#x201D; [Swift]. Carlyle&#x2019;s letters to Hill have not been found. A few excerpts from Hill&#x2019;s letters to Carlyle follow: &#x201C;I was Disappointed at finding <hi rend="italic">her</hi> in a devil of a bad, shy humuor &#x2026; but &#x2026; these are joys and sorrows, pleasures and pains with which a Stoick, Platonic, <hi rend="italic">humdrum</hi>, bookworm sort of a fellow, like you Sir, intermeddleth not, &#x26; consequently can have no idea of&#x201D; (<date when="1814-01-01">1 Jan. 1814</date>). &#x201C;I am sure that you must find the study of Natural History very interesting; You had always a taste after Knowledge of that kind.&#x2014; You mention having read some of Archdeacon Paley&#x2019;s works, and desire my opinion of them<supplied>[.]</supplied> I should feel considerable hesitation in giving my opinion to such a superior judge, were I not aware that, with respect to the Author at least, it must be in unison with your own&#x201D; (<date when="1814-01-03">3</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814-01-08">8 Jan. 1814</date>). &#x201C;Replete as your letter is with humour you never lose sight of that good sense and learning for which (pardon me, I <hi rend="italic">do not</hi> flatter you) you are so remarkable&#x201D; (<date when="1814-02-24">24</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814-02-26">26 Feb. 1814</date>). &#x201C;I am advised to take a voyage to some warm climate &#x2026; and remain there for a couple of years for the re-establishment of my health.&#x2014; And if I can procure a situation to my mind in Malta or Madeira &#x2026; I have a strong inclination to try it&#x201D; (<date when="1814-03-21">21 March 1814</date>). &#x201C;I have just seen the Courier, and must confess I was disappointed at the suppression of your answer (which the Editor is pleased to call a severe retaliation) to W. &#x26; D.&#x2014;you will therefore, without further ceremony &#x2026; make out a transcript of the same, and transmit it by the hands of Ja<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Johnstone Carrier, addressed to the Rt. Worsp<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Peter Pindar Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Poet Latin Middlebie, as you shall answer for the same &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;&#x201D; (<date when="1814-03-30">30 March 1814</date>, addressed to Carlyle as &#x201C;Dean&#x201D; [Swift]). &#x201C;You seem to take a friendly concern in my <foreign><hi rend="italic">affaires de coe</hi>[<hi rend="italic">u</hi>]<hi rend="italic">r</hi></foreign>.&#x2014; By the by now, Jonathan, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> telling you any particulars respecting <hi rend="italic">my</hi> situation in <supplied>[these]</supplied> matters, which is scarcely known to myself, can&#x2019;t I advise <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to <hi rend="italic">fall in love</hi>. &#x2026; Fall in love as soon as you can meet with a <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> object, but let your love be untainted with any desires of a grosser nature&#x201D; (<date when="1814-05-09">9 May 1814</date>). Most of these letters are dated from Castlebank.</note> He is a <pb id="pg-01-167" n="01:167"/>harmless kind of youth&#x2014;&#x26; had a clean landlady; who kept two rooms with a bed in each which we could get for 8/ per week. My proposal was immediately accepted of: and I removed hither yesterday (Monday) evening. This comradeship is not altogether to my liking, as I fear it may encumber my researches; but when I consider the saving of 3/6 per week (not to speak of that which arises from <hi rend="italic">two</hi> eating together)&#x2014;as well as the neatness, &#x26; comfort which seems to pervade this place, I am induced to put up with the other inconveniences, till <date when="1819-04-00">April</date>, when I may take Forrest&#x2019;s room, or have a choice of others. Besides we stipulated to have a fire in each room, when we liked at night, so that I can retire to this small chamber whenever I have any thing particular to investigate. The chamber, to say truth, is <supplied>[not]</supplied> many square feet in extent, yet it will do excellently well for the short season during which I shall occupy it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Flitting</hi></foreign> [moving house] is an operation which has, of late years, become very irksome to me; so you are not to expect that, in this letter, I can give you any very interesting remarks: forasmuch as I have even now scarcely ended the arrangement of my goods&#x2014;I write principally to send you my address &#x26; to request an answer from some of you&#x2014;</p>
<p>I know it will please you all to hear that my health is good. Whenever the morning is fair, I walk before breakfast; and after finishing the German at eleven o&#x2019;clock, I generally stroll for an hour or so about the environs of this city&#x2014;a practice, which, I know well, is the only <pb id="pg-01-168" n="01:168"/>plan for securing vigourous health. There is a young man Fergus<supplied>[s]</supplied>on (a cousin of the Celt Maclaren&#x2019;s,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Fergusson (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), son of a farmer at Conachan, Glenalmond, Perthshire. Like Carlyle, he found teaching distasteful, but he became a distinguished teacher, first at the Academy of Arbroath from <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date> to <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>, then as rector of the Kelso Grammar School, Roxburghshire. See Gorrie, pp. 628&#x2013;39. The Celt is Charles Maclaren (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), co-founder in <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date> of the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> and its editor from <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date> to <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>.</note> whom you dined with at Dysart), formerly Irving&#x2019;s assistant at Kirk<supplied>[c]</supplied>aldy&#x2014;who, being disengaged at that hour, is as glad as I, to escape from the &#x2018;sin &#x26; sea-coal&#x2019; of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and often accompanies me. He is a sensible, pleasant man, three or four years older than myself. On Tuesday last, when he &#x26; I were returning into the town from our excursion, we met Dr Brewster,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. David Brewster (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>), editor of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</hi> (<date when="1785-01-00">Jan. 1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803-12-00">Dec. 1803</date>), and its successors the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Journal of Science</hi>, author of <hi rend="italic">The Life of Sir Isaac Newton</hi> (London, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), and editor of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</hi> from <date when="1807-00-00">1807</date> until its completion in <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>. As principal of Edinburgh University he introduced Carlyle when he gave his lecture as rector on <date when="1866-04-02">2 April 1866</date>.</note> in company with two men of note. The Dr stopped to tell me that he had got a paper on Chemistry written (in French) by Berzelius,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron Jacob Berzelius (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>). Carlyle&#x2019;s translation of his &#x201C;Examination of Some Compounds Which Depend upon Very Weak Affinities&#x201D; appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</hi>, I (<date when="1819-06-00">June 1819</date>), 63&#x2013;75; (<date when="1819-10-00">Oct. 1819</date>), 243&#x2013;53.</note> professor of that science at Stockholm&#x2014;which was to be published in <date when="1819-04-00">April</date>:&#x2014;would I translate it? I answered in the affirmative; and next day went over to get the paper in question. It consists of six long sheets, written in a cramp hand, &#x26; in a very diffuse <supplied>[s]</supplied>tile. I have it more than half done. The labour of writing it down is the principal one. In other respects there is no difficulty. I do not expect great remuneration, for this thing; but as I am anxious to do it pretty well, it interrupts my other pursuits a little. Before I began it, I was busied in preparing to write about some other thing; but what will be the upshot of it I cannot say.&#x2014; I tell you all these things, because I know that nothing which concerns me is a matter of indifference to you.</p>
<p>About a week ago, I very briefly discussed an <hi rend="italic">hour</hi> of private teaching. A man in the New town applied to one Nicol<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the Nichol whom Carlyle met in John Waugh&#x2019;s rooms in <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date> and described in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> (II, 22) as a &#x201C;shrewd, merry, and very social kind of person&#x201D; and &#x201C;a sharp man, with lips rather quizzically close.&#x201D; By <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date> this Nichol had moved to Airdrie.</note> public teacher of Mathematics here, for a person to give instructions in Arithmetic or some thing of that sort. Nicol spoke of me, and I was in consequence directed to call upon the man next morning. I went at the appointed <pb id="pg-01-169" n="01:169"/>hour &#x26; after waiting a few minutes, was met by a stout, impudent-looking man&#x2014;with red whiskers&#x2014;having very much the air of an attorney, or some creature of that sort. As our conversation may give you some insight into these matters, I report the substance of it. &#x201C;I am here,&#x201D; I said after making a slight bow, which was just perceptibly returned, &#x201C;by the request of Mr Nicol&#x2014;to spea<supplied>[k]</supplied> with you Sir, about a Mathematical teacher, whom, he tells me, you want&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Aye. What are your terms?&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Two guineas a-month, for each hour&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Two guineas</hi>!! for private teaching&#x2014;that is perfectly extravagant!&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x201C;I <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> it to be the rate at which every teacher of respectability in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> officiates; and I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> it to be the rate below which <hi rend="italic">I</hi> never officiate.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">That</hi> won&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> friend.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;I am sorry, that nothing less will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. Good morning.&#x201D; And I retired with considerable deliberation. The time has been when I should have vapoured not a little, at being so cavalierly treated by a wretched person of this description. But it is altered now. I reflected only that this man wanted (and that was natural) to have his business done cheap; and that his ill breeding was his misfortune perhaps as much as crime.&#x2014; A day may come, when I shall look back upon these things with a smile;&#x2014;<supplied>[if]</supplied> that day should never come, the maxim of the Poet is not more trite than true:</p>
<lg><l><supplied>[Hono]</supplied>ur &#x26; shame from no condition rise;</l>
<l><supplied>[Act]</supplied> well your part: <hi rend="italic">there</hi> all the honour lies.&#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pope, <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi>, IV, 193.</note></l></lg>
<p>This world, my boy, is but a fight at best; and tho&#x2019; the battle go against us, yet he, who quits
him like a man<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I Cor. 16:13.</note>&#x2014;is an object, upon which (as an old philosopher has written) superior natures delight to look.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. I Sam. 4:9; I Cor. 16:13; <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>, XIII, 290, 391.</note></p>
<p>Last week I received an umbrella which I had left in Fife, and a kind letter from Mr Swan.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Provost William Swan&#x2019;s letter to Carlyle is dated <date when="1819-02-16">16 Feb.</date> Concerning the umbrella, see Wilson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, I, 161.</note> If ever I come to any thing, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is one person, whom I shall remember.</p>
<p>But it is after one&#x2014;so I shall conclude. This lad Hill &#x26; I seem to have pretty nearly equal quantities of provender, at the present date; and as he may not get any more from home, I think it will be as well if you send me no more also, till I write. I can get the clothes (in the interim) washed by the landlady, who appears to follow some trade of that sort. Write to me by the return of post, if the Harlot<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An irreverent name for the carrier.</note> be not <pb id="pg-01-170" n="01:170"/>about to set forward.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I wrote a letter to you, some time ago, enquiring after the fate of a certain poor Italian dictionary, which I had the pleasure of lending you, last year. As the letter contained (if I recollect rightly) a sufficiently explicit statement of the case, I am tempted to impute your not having answered it instantly, to some neglect of the postmaster. If my present sheet should reach its destination prosperously, it will inform you that I have been in want of the dictionary for two weeks; and that I wish, without any delay, either to receive it, or to hear that it is not to be had&#x2014;in which case I may purchase another. Between friends such a matter is a trifle: but it must appear very unaccountable, if upon this second application, you do not, by the very first post, put my doubts on that head to rest.</p>
<p>I shall be much gratified to get intelligence of your fortune: I might send you some details about my own, but it has nowise altered since I wrote last; and has therefore a most indefinite and wavering aspect. Your road through life seems to be separating from mine, perhaps never more to meet. During the five years, that have elapsed since we lived together, each must have acquired principles and predilections, in which the other cannot be expected to participate. Yet I trust for the sake of both, that neither of us will cease to remember, with a meek and kindly feeling, that pleasant period which we spent together&#x2014; Betide us what will; whenever we meet again, may each see, in the friend of his youth, a man unsullied by any thing that is paltry or degrading!&#x2014; <closer><salute>With every wish for your happiness,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>I remain, / My Dear Sir, / Yours faithfully, /</salute></closer>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I snatch a hurried hour from the German lesson, to answer your kind and entertaining epistle, which reached me this forenoon. I need not say how pleasing it is to me to learn that you are all in good bodily health, and comfortable spirits. The most important part of my task will be accomplished, when I have assured you that the same is the case with me. I still walk out before breakfast&#x2014;and for an hour or two after; of which practice I find the beneficial effects in an increased appetite for <hi rend="italic">victual</hi>, and a general vigour of body. I have no doubt that two or three months of summer exercise will completely restore this my <hi rend="italic">digestive apparatus</hi> (as our Professor calls it) to that state of activity which a person at my age, not addicted to excesses of any kind, and gifted with a sound constitution, ought naturally to expect.</p>
<p>I was interested by the intelligence you transmit to me. Poor Latimer&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">hunting-tunes</hi>, recall some by-gone scenes to my recollection. The paraphrases need not be pushed beyond moderation: they <hi rend="italic">must</hi> in time come to be generally employed.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Latimer&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">hunting-tunes</hi> (as this Ecclefechan &#x201C;worthy&#x201D; called them&#x2014;and from what can be gathered from Alick&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1819-03-25">25 March</date>) were paraphrases, i.e., versified passages from the Bible, used in the absence of hymns in the Church of Scotland. Trouble arose when an attempt was made by a new minister to introduce them to the Ecclefechan meetinghouse of the Burgh Seceders, those dissenters from the Scottish Kirk among whom were the Carlyles. They were offensive to the congregation, &#x201C;narrow <foreign><hi rend="italic">nebed</hi></foreign> [nosed] whigs,&#x201D; as their opponents called them. Scottish paraphrases were authorized by the General Assembly in <date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>, and collections were published thereafter. See Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 72.</note> It is greivous to learn the misconduct of poor Mary Brown.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Your unfortunate cusen,&#x201D; Alick wrote, &#x201C;was delivered of a daughter about three weeks ago. &#x2026;&#x201D; It seems more likely that Mary Brown was the granddaughter, not the daughter, of Carlyle&#x2019;s aunt Fanny Brown, <hi rend="italic">n&#xE9;e</hi> Gillespie, who about <date when="1773-00-00">1773</date> married William Brown of Peebles.</note> An unlucky race, as you rightly remark: but your consolation is well founded too;&#x2014;&#x2018;every herring must <pb id="pg-01-172" n="01:172"/>indeed hang by its own head.&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Scottish proverb goes, &#x201C;Let every herring hang by its own head. Every man must stand by his own endeavour.&#x201D; Scott employed it in <hi rend="italic">Rob Roy</hi> (chap. xxvi): &#x201C;Let every herring hing by its ain head, and every sheep by its ain shank.&#x201D;</note> I think I recollect the <hi rend="italic">Hash</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lit., to mangle or cut up; here a Scottish term of obloquy. The <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Hash&#x201D;</hi> was one Irving, an Annan butcher, &#x201C;whose father was <supplied>[a]</supplied> farmer in Knockhill formerly.&#x201D;</note> that has done the mischief&#x2014;a large, square soft-looking lump, about a year older than myself. Jock Carruthers<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The son of Mrs. (Jean) Carruthers of Haregills, &#x201C;a Cousin of my Mother&#x2019;s&#x2014; Bell by maiden-name, solid, rather stupid, Farmer&#x2019;s Wife by station &#x2026;&#x201D; See A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi>, I, 22 n.</note> (of Har<supplied>[e]</supplied>gills) staid in his Mother&#x2019;s house. Does the slut-thief propose to marry the unlucky creature?</p>
<p>I am glad to understand that the library<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ecclefechan library, in which Alick took a great interest and to which Carlyle, in later years especially, made many contributions.</note> is in a prosperous state. It is to be hoped that our native village will no longer be the scorn of neighbouring districts, for its deficiency in this particular. You are very right in stating that the Abb&#xE9; Raynal<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Abb&#xE9; Guillaume Thomas Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Raynal (<date when="1713-00-00">1713</date>&#x2013;<date when="1796-00-00">96</date>). Alick was reading his <hi rend="italic">L'Histoire philosophique et politique des &#xE9;tablissements et du commerce des Europ&#xE9;ens dans les deux Indes,</hi> 4 vols. (Amsterdam, <date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>), perhaps the J. O. Justamond translation of <date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>, which included &#x201C;the Revolution of America, by the Same Author.&#x201D;</note> is rash in some of his conjectures. He was a jesuit priest in his time; but afterwards quarrelled with them&#x2014;renounced their society, and with it, all moderation in treating of their religion. He was obliged to leave France for his opinions, &#x26; resided for a time in England and lastly in the Netherlands. The man seems to have had a fiery temper; and it is only for the <hi rend="italic">facts</hi> that his books contain, that anyone can respect them<supplied>[.]</supplied> There is no wonder that you feel it impossible to find much time for reading in the present season. Keep doing a little at your hours of relaxation&#x2014;both in writing and reading; and you will never repent it. In reading Raynal, you will of course attend to the geography of the countries.</p>
<p>What ails that indolent young person, Doil,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stupid, confused, crazy, from <hi rend="italic">doillit, doilt</hi>: a family nickname for TC&#x2019;s brother John.</note> or more properly speaking, Jack, that he will not write? If I had any time, I would send him a letter this very night.</p>
<p>With respect to my occupations at this period; they are not of the most important nature. Berzelius&#x2019; paper is printed&#x2014;I was this day correcting the proof-sheet&#x2014;. The translation looks not very ill in print. I wish I had plenty more of a similar <supplied>[sor]</supplied>t to translate and good pay for doing it. Let us wait a while. I am still at the German, as I hinted <pb id="pg-01-173" n="01:173"/>above. My teacher<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Jardine of G&#xF6;ttingen and Applegarth, Dumfriesshire.</note> is not a man (any more than he was a boy) of brilliant parts; but we go on in a loving way together&#x2014;and he gives me the <hi rend="italic">pronunciation</hi> correctly, I suppose. I am able to read books, now, with a dictionary. At present, I am reading a stupid play of Kotzebue&#x2019;s<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1819-08-00">August</date> Friedrich Ferdinand von Kotzebue (<date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>&#x2013;<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>). In his <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> (p. 36), while praising Schiller&#x2019;s elevated treatment, in <hi rend="italic">Kabale und Liebe</hi>, of the age-old theme of the conflict of &#x201C;political manoeuvering, of cold worldly wisdom, with the pure impassioned movements of the young heart,&#x201D; Carlyle again speaks of the German dramatist and &#x201C;other intellectual Jacobins,&#x201D; who have &#x201C;tortured into a thousand shapes, and tricked out with a thousand tawdry devices and meretricious ornaments&#x201D; this same theme, and &#x201C;whose productions have brought what we falsely call the &#x2018;German Theatre&#x2019; into such deserved contempt in England.&#x201D; By <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>, in the essay &#x201C;German Playwrights&#x201D; (p. 360), Carlyle had reduced him to one whose &#x201C;windbag <supplied>[had]</supplied> burst asunder &#x2026;&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;but to-night I am to have the history of Frederick the Great from Irving. I will make an <foreign><hi rend="italic">affu' struggle</hi></foreign><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An expression of the carrier&#x2019;s.</note> to read a good deal of it &#x26; of the Italian in Summer&#x2014;when at home.</p>
<p>The young man Hill is going away in about a week&#x2014;a few days after which, I in<supplied>[tend t]</supplied>o be in Forrest&#x2019;s No. 3. S. Richmond st. Not that I profoundly a<supplied>[d]</supplied>mire the character of Jock&#x2014;for I believe him after all to be a &#x2018;<supplied>[Tu]</supplied>rk in grain&#x2019;;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A favorite phrase of Carlyle which usually means &#x201C;a bad fellow through and through.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">OED</hi> quotes his use of the expression in <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays</hi>. It is uncertain whether he had coined the phrase or found it in an earlier source.</note> but his wife is a trusty neat-handed, excellent body; and the room will do as long as I live in it&#x2014;for I have thoughts of coming down to you, about <date when="1819-06-00">June</date> or so. I hate to go to a stranger; and Forrest&#x2019;s in other aspects is an eligible place.</p>
<p>There is nothing new here that I wot of&#x2014;fierce sort of weather, which I daresay is no stranger to you. How do the farming operations proceed? I hope to help you at the hay-time. But time is our tedious scroll should now have ending.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I am so much obliged to you for the affectionate concern, which you express for me, in that brief letter&#x2014;that I cannot delay to send <pb id="pg-01-174" n="01:174"/>you a few words by way of reply&#x2014; I need not repeat, what I have already told to Sandy who will be glad to communicate it, that I am in good health&#x2014; If I continue to walk, I shall become very strong shortly&#x2014; I was affected by the short notice you give me of Aunt Mary&#x2019;s death,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s mother had announced the death of her sister Mary in her letter to him of <date when="1819-03-25">25 March</date>.</note> and the short reflection with which you close it. It is true, My dear Mother, that &#x201C;we must all soon follow her&#x201D;&#x2014;such is the unalterable and not unpleasing doom of men&#x2014;then it is well for those, who at that awful moment which is before everyone, shall be able to look back with calmness, and forward with hope. But I need not dwell upon this solemn subject&#x2014;it is familiar to the thoughts of every one who has any thought.</p>
<p>I am rather afraid that I have not been quite regular in reading that best of books which you recommended to me. However last night I was reading upon my favourite Job; and I hope to do better in time to come. I entreat you to believe that I am sincerely desirous of being a good man; and tho&#x2019; we may differ in some few unimportant particulars: yet I firmly trust that the same Power who created us with imperfect faculties, will pardon the errors of every one (and none are without them) who seeks truth and righteousness, with a simple heart.</p>
<p>You need not fear my studying too much. In fact my prospects are so unsettled that I do not often sit down to books with all the zeal that I am capable of. You are not to think I am fretful. I have long accustomed my mind to look upon the future with a sedate aspect; and at any rate, my hopes have never yet failed me. A French Author (D'Alembert,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Le Rond d'Alembert (<date when="1717-00-00">1717</date>&#x2013;<date when="1783-00-00">83</date>), French mathematician and philosopher associated with Diderot in editing the <hi rend="italic">Encyclop&#xE9;die</hi>. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251025-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1825-10-25">25 Oct. 1825</date></ref>.</note> one of the few persons who deserve the honourable epithet of honest man) whom I was lately reading, remarks that one who devotes his life to learning ought to carry for his motto&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Liberty, Truth, Poverty</hi>; for he that fears the latter can never have the former. This should not prevent one from using every honest effort to attain a comfortable situation in life; it says only that the best is dearly bought by base conduct, and the worst is not worth mourning over. But I tire you I doubt&#x2014;we shall speak about all these matters more fully in summer. For I am meditating just now to come down to stay awhile with you&#x2014;accompanied with a cargo of books. Italian German &#x26; others&#x2014;you will give me yonder little room&#x2014;and you will&#x2019; waken me every morning <pb id="pg-01-175" n="01:175"/>about 5 or 6 o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;then <hi rend="italic">such</hi> study&#x2014;I shall delve in the yard too; and in a word become not only the wisest but the strongest man in those regions. This is all <foreign><hi rend="italic">claver</hi></foreign> [idle talk] but it pleases one. The young man Murray (with whom I used to correspond) informs me that he thinks of going to teach and preach in the island of Man: and invites me to spend a month or two with <supplied>[him]</supplied>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See TM to TC, <date when="1819-03-20">20 March</date>: &#x201C;You might spend a month or two with me in a happy and profitable manner.&#x201D; The brackets here are Carlyle&#x2019;s</note> Perhaps it would be well to go. But we shall talk about all this afterwards&#x2014;</p>
<p>If the carrier do not come before a fortnight, you may direct the box to me at Forrest&#x2019;s. I long to have some cakes. The last, I think, were the best I ever ate. The butter you will be astonished to learn is nearly done. I have no doubt that it has been filched: and besides Hill has eaten of it since I came, having given me meal in return&#x2014; If you send a<supplied>[ny le]</supplied>t it be a pound or so.</p>
<p><closer><salute>I am reduced to this part of the sheet to subscribe myself,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am chargeable with very great negligence in having withheld from you, for some weeks, a letter which you were kind enough to solicit so earnestly.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray wrote in his letter of <date when="1819-03-20">20 March</date>: &#x201C;I hope you will forgive and forget my silence&#x2014; I trust you will write me soon to tell me how you do. To have incurred the reproach and suspicion of one whose abilities I venerate and whose friendship I am proud of has caused me a degree of uneasiness exceeding belief.&#x201D;</note> The book arrived, a few days after I was favoured with your communication: I did not tell you so three weeks ago, for the old reasons&#x2014;too much or too little business, spirits, health &#x26;c &#x26;c. I have likewise received <hi rend="italic">another</hi> book along with the Dictionary. I suppose it to belong to Samuel Caven Jun<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, as certain characters upon the title-page seem to indicate; and what is to be done with it I know not&#x2014; But more than enough of these trivial matters&#x2014; Perhaps, however, I ought to bring to your mind a publication belonging to John Forrest, <pb id="pg-01-176" n="01:176"/>the Marrow of Modern Divinity<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Marrow of Modern Divinity</hi> (<date when="1646-00-00">1646</date>) by Edward Fisher (fl. <date when="1627-00-00">1627</date>&#x2013;<date when="1655-00-00">55</date>). The edition of <date when="1717-00-00">1717</date> caused great controversy.</note>&#x2014;Peden&#x2019;s Prophecies<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Peden, <hi rend="italic">Life and Prophecies</hi> (Paisley, <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>).</note>&#x2014;the Cloud of Witnesses<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Howie (<date when="1735-00-00">1735</date>&#x2013;<date when="1793-00-00">93</date>), <hi rend="italic">A Cloud of Witnesses</hi> (Glasgow, <date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>).</note> or some such book, which it seems you borrowed from him. Four out of the five times that I have been in his house, Jack has bewailed the loss of this precious tome, in a manner as heart-rending as ever Scaliger bewailed the lost decades of Livy. It is not probable that you would wish to lie under any obligation to this &#x2018;Turk in grain&#x2019;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190316-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1819-03-16">16 March</date></ref>.</note> therefore I counsel you to send back the Marrow to its despairing owner, as quickly as you can.</p>
<p>I congratulate you, my Friend, on the prospect which you have of obtaining a settlement that in some degree meets your wishes.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray had recently returned from Douglas, Isle of Man, where he had preached two sermons and had been offered a position as minister which he was now considering.</note> The despicable wretchedness of teaching can be known only to those who have tried it; and to Him who made the heart, and knows it all&#x2014; One meets with few spectacles more afflicting than that of a young man, with a free spirit, with impetuous tho&#x2019; honourable feelings, condemned to waste the flower of his life in such a calling; to fade in it, by the slow but sure corrosion of discontent; and at last, obscurely &#x26; unprofitably to leave, with an indignant eye, the miseries of a world, which his talents <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have illustrated and his virtues adorned. Such things have been and will be. But surely in that better life, which good men dream of, the spirit of a Kepler or a Milton will find a more propitious destiny.&#x2014; To return&#x2014;I long to hear that you have comfortably adjusted your establishment in the Island&#x2014; In the event of your going thither, you have only to exert your abilities with the zeal and prudence of which you are capable; and, I am convinced, your hopes of respectability and contentment will not be disappointed. Probably you are disposed to agree with the Pariah of St Pierre, in thinking that &#x2018;there is no real happiness without a good wife&#x2019;: and it may be, you are right. Let me advise you, however (you need not frown&#x2014;I am not going to jest&#x2014;but to give most serious &#x26; weighty counsel), to examine and re-examine the circumstances, before taking any step in consequence of this persuasion. A calendar month destroys the illusions of the Imagination; and if Judgement be not interested&#x2014;the rest of one&#x2019;s life is the very gall of bitterness. A narrow income too!&#x2014; It would break your heart&#x2014;at least I hope it would&#x2014;to see the <pb id="pg-01-177" n="01:177"/>helplessness of an amiable woman (granting that your choice was fortunate) exposed to the hard unkindness, from which you had undertaken, but were unable, to defend her. Of a truth such a thing should give us pause. But I doubt not your good sense will render this advice superfluous: your good nature will pardon it&#x2014; Considering the motive which has called it forth&#x2014;</p>
<p>As to my own prospects, I am sorry, on several accounts, that I can give no satisfactory reply to your friendly inquiries. A good portion of my life is already mingled with the past Eternity; and for the Future&#x2014;it is a dim scene, on which my eyes are fixed as calmly &#x26; intensely as possible&#x2014;to no purpose. The probability of my doing any service, in my day &#x26; generation, is certainly not very strong. Friends are necessary; and I have few friends&#x2014;and most of those few have their own Concerns to mind&#x2014; Health also is requisite; but my late precious trade&#x2014;and indolent habits (it must be owned) have left me little of that to boast of&#x2014; So I have thought and <hi rend="italic">only</hi> thought of several things during the winter. My operations have been limited to the acquisition of an exceeding slight knowledge of the German language and the perusal of some few books that are little likely to turn to much profit&#x2014; I have <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> Professor Jameson&#x2019;s lectures,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prof. Robert Jameson&#x2019;s reputation was at its height at this time. See J. G. Lockhart&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Peter&#x2019;s Letters to His Kinsfolk</hi>, I, 250; and <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210130-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1821-01-30">30 Jan. 1821</date></ref>.</note> which happily terminated this day&#x2014; You once attended him I think: therefore it is not necessary to say how ravishing it was to sit and hear the <hi rend="italic">names</hi> not only of the &#x2018;old red sandstone, and the coal form<supplied>[ation,&#x2019;]</supplied> but also of corundums, schorls, meerschaums, calc-tu<supplied>[f]</supplied>fs &#x26;c which no man can number. I have learned little, except that I am not calculated for being a Mineralogist&#x2014; And now that the summer is coming I suppose it will be most adviseable to carry a few books down to my Father&#x2019;s house; and try whether the air of Dumfriesshire will not restore its vigour to this &#x2018;digestive-apparatus&#x2019; (as Prof. J. calls it) which has for some time been very inefficient, not to say refractory&#x2014; Then with a sound body and a stout heart&#x2014;!&#x2014; For we must not die <hi rend="italic">so soft</hi> as this.&#x2014; Few things could give me more pleasure than to spend a month with you in the healthful breezes of Man. But it depends upon so many contingencies, that the prospect is too remote and uncertain for being calculated on. We shall see.</p>
<p>You have to answer for the sin of keeping me almost two hours from &#x2018;Planta&#x2019;s history of the Helvetic confederacy&#x2019;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Planta (<date when="1744-00-00">1744</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), <hi rend="italic">The History of the Helvetic Confederacy</hi>, 2 vols.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>In compliance with your request, I transmit to you, by the medium of our dearly-beloved Johnston, the information which I have gleaned respecting your Brother<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Mitchell. In a letter from RM to TC, <date when="1817-06-09">9 June 1817</date>, Mitchell had said that his brother was in Antigua.</note> at St John&#x2019;s&#x2014;and the plan of our correspondence during the summer. It is the rainy evening of a dull day which I have spent in reading a little of Klopstock&#x2019;s Messias<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock (<date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>), <hi rend="italic">Messias</hi>, 4 vols. (Halle, <date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>&#x2013;<date when="1773-00-00">73</date>).</note> (for the man Jardine, who broke his engagement); and in looking over the inflated work of &#x2018;Squire Bristed on &#x2018;America and her resources.&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Bristed (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), <hi rend="italic">America and Her Resources</hi> (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>). Norton says that Bristed was a clergyman of the Church of England who had settled in America and that his book made some noise at the time.</note> &#x2018;Vivacity,&#x2019; therefore, on my part, is quite out of the question&#x2014; But without further preface&#x2014;</p>
<p>From the scanty notices communicated by the Antigua Doctor, it appears that your Brother returned from America about two years ago; that he is unmarried, and maintains a small tho&#x2019; respectable domestic establishment in the chief town of the island; that his trading capital, which was disposed of at his departure, has not been replaced since his return; that, in fact, trade being rather <hi rend="italic">low</hi> in those parts, and William in consequence not engaged in enterprises of great moment, he is living principally at present by the produce of his former industry. Such is all the meagre detail which I could extract from James Johnston <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Bogs.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnston&#x2019;s usual nickname is &#x201C;The Targer.&#x201D; &#x201C;Bogs&#x201D; is probably a short form of Bogside, the family farm in Dumfriesshire. A common Scotticism is to name a person by his farm.</note> But if you will be prevailed upon to visit Mainhill, any time <pb id="pg-01-179" n="01:179"/>shortly&#x2014;James declares himself ready to give you every satisfaction. At all events he returns to the land flowing with rum &#x26; treacle, in about two months, and will be extremely happy at being charged with any message or letter from you.</p>
<p>With regard to the conveyance of our letters&#x2014;I have ascertained that one John Little is almost daily in the habit of driving coals from Annan to Ecclefechan. He always calls at the house of his brother-in-law, James Thomson,&#x2014;a man who lives within three doors of the gaol&#x2014;and pursues no earthly occupation, but buttressing the house-corner and eating victual. I spoke to the man Little: and if, from these data, you can invent an address which may enable our old friend Post John to deliver your letter into the hands of this coal-man, I have no doubt that it will arrive safely at Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. To confess a truth, I am not without my doubts of your punctuality: yet am I unwilling to forego the hope of frequently hearing from you. My life for some months is likely to be peaceful &#x26; destitute of incident: a letter from Ruthwell will constitute a pleasing variety in the simple avocations which, principal<supplied>[l]</supplied>y it must be confessed for avoiding <foreign>ennui</foreign>, I desing <supplied>[design]</supplied> to pursue for a few months.</p>
<p>I have done, as usual, almost nothing since we parted&#x2014; Some one asked me with a smile, of which I knew not the meaning, if I would read <hi rend="italic">that</hi> book, putting into my hands a volume of Rousseau&#x2019;s confessions.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Jacques Rousseau (<date when="1712-00-00">1712</date>&#x2013;<date when="1778-00-00">78</date>), <hi rend="italic">Confessions</hi>, 4 vols. (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1789-00-00">89</date>).</note> It is perhaps the most remarkable tome, I ever read. Except for its occassional obscenity, I might wish to see the remainder of the book: to try if possible to connect the character of Jean Jacques with my previous ideas of human nature. To say he was mad were to cut the knot, without loosing it. At any rate, what could have induced any mortal, mad or wise, to recollect and delineate such a tissue of vulgar debauchery, falseheartedness &#x26; misery&#x2014;is quite beyond my comprehension. If we regret our exclusion from that Gallic constellation, which has set, and found no successor to its brilliancy&#x2014;the memoirs of Marmontel <note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Marmontel (<date when="1723-00-00">1723</date>&#x2013;<date when="1799-00-00">99</date>), <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires d'un p&#xE8;re</hi>, 4 vols. (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>).</note> or Rousseau&#x2019;s confessions should teach a virtuous Briton to be content with the dull sobriety of his native country. I will not speak of the Abb&#xE9; Raynal: of others I have nothing to say.</p>
<p>It is late; the husbandmen of this rustic mansion are all sunk in profound repose: why should <hi rend="italic">I</hi> longer wake? A slender steed is to be saddled for me to-morrow by six o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;whereupon I design to ride <pb id="pg-01-180" n="01:180"/>with this sheet to Johnston at Bogside&#x2014; An important errand, you will say.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I came hither yesterday for the melancholy purpose of convoying Mr Johnston on board the ship Severn, which is to transport him, in a few days, to St John&#x2019;s New Brunswick; and I cannot let slip the opportunity, which his farewell letter affords me, of inquiring after your state, and briefly explaining my own.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of your letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seems to be missing as Carlyle has replied to that of <date when="1819-03-20">20 March</date>.</note> I have received no manner of intelligence respecting the Manx negociation. <hi rend="italic">Are</hi> you to go and preach in the island? My ignorance of the circumstances would render my counsel of no value&#x2014; My best wishes are all that I can give you. Every year, I can participate more and more, in the uncomfortable lonely feeling which you justly describe as the portion of persons without a home. A part of every one&#x2019;s life must be spent in this condition&#x2014;which, till the experience of a few years has stript our prospects of their glory, is not without its charms. When it becomes irksome, it ought to be remedied rather than lamented. You can judge, better than I, whether <pb id="pg-01-181" n="01:181"/>the profferred emolument is a sufficient reward for the services to be performed; you will consider likewise whether the obstruction which your settlement in the Island of Man may place in the way of acquiring, what would certainly be more comfortable, the charge of a parish in Scotland, should not induce <supplied>[you]</supplied> to suffer, yet a little, the miseries (or vexations rather) of tutorship&#x2014;grievous as they are. I am persuaded that your determination&#x2014;if you have yet to determine&#x2014;will be formed upon wise &#x26; honourable principles.</p>
<p>You have not, for a long while, given me any notice of your studies or literary speculations. Our pursuits in that department are not perfectly similar; but you ought not for that reason to suppose that I can view your efforts with indifference. In the biographical <hi rend="italic">line</hi> (to speak Merchantlike, in this trading district) I have formed rather high expectations of you. That sort of writing has been very little cultivated in Britain: its uses however, are manifold and obvious; whilst success in it is rewarded by a meed of fame more promptly as well as more plentifully paid&#x2014;than in other researches where the expense of thought and industry is much greater. The qualifications of a Biographer have sometimes been rated low: but to illustrate human character, to trace the progress of philosophical discovery, to estimate and class the creations of &#x2018;the poet&#x2019;s pen&#x2019;&#x2014;to do all this properly, no ordinary talents and diligence in the use of them, are absolutely requisite. A
Bower or an Anderson<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Alexander Bower (fl. <date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">30</date>), assistant librarian at Edinburgh University, who published various biographical and historical works; and Robert Anderson (<date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), editor of <hi rend="italic">Complete Edition of the Poets of Great Britain</hi> (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792-00-00">95</date>).</note> can tell when a man of genius was born and died&#x2014;they can<supplied>[n]</supplied>ot write his life.&#x2014; What have you made of poor Lewis?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stewart Lewis.</note> You will not find his adventures capable of giving interest to a minute narrative.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle probably has in mind Murray&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Literary History of Galloway</hi> (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>), under way by now. Lewis is not included.</note> His genius, tho&#x2019; rather extraordinary for a Stay-maker, was not of the highest order; his principles were not too rigid, and in practice (poor fellow!) he was any thing but a purist.&#x2014; By the bye, speaking of poets (this introduction will bring to your mind the celebrated story of a <hi rend="italic">Gun</hi>&#x2014;no matter&#x2014;speaking of poets) Will<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Irving&#x2019;s widow is married lately to one Andrew (if I err not) a school-master about Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. I understand her circumstances since the decease of her husband to have been very straitened&#x2014;of this Andrew I know nothing. But you have enough of this.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-182" n="01:182"/>With regard to my own history since my last letter, time compels me to be brief. Most probably I mentioned that I designed to spend some months of the summer at my Father&#x2019;s&#x2014; That design is now in some degree executed. I came home early in <date when="1819-05-00">May</date>&#x2014;and have been in Annandale till Saturday last. My health has been improving&#x2014;before Winter it will be quite reestablished. My studies are scarcely begun; tho&#x2019; I have half sketched out a plan for my summer&#x2019;s labours&#x2014; Visits of acquaintance&#x2014;and more lately our friend&#x2019;s approaching emigration have distracted my attention entirely. My former German teacher is now living in Lockerby [torn] and two or three lessons which I have had from him are (alas!) <supplied>[not]</supplied> the least important of my atchievements. What I forecast, how I feel, what I think of my native place after several years of absence &#x26;c, you shall hear more particularly next time I write. I need not say that the prospect of being separated from James Johnston&#x2014;for a long period perhaps forever, has shed a gloom over all my thoughts&#x2014; It will be but temporary: for I expect he will be happy&#x2014; Meantime it is very painful. May he find that good fortune, which talents industry &#x26; sterling probity should always find!</p>
<p>But I am hurried and interrupted by the arrival of tea. <closer><salute>It remains for me therefore only to beg your indulgence for the errors of this poor letter&#x2014;which I have not time even to read over, to request an answer to it as soon as possible; and to subscribe myself</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>My dear Sir, / Your&#x2019;s faithfully, /</salute></closer>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>Owing to the negligence of our Carrier, the parcel, which you so kindly despatched to me, lingered on the road till yesterday. It required some such circumstance to induce me, at so short a notice, to think of making my acknowledgements; tho&#x2019; by writing this letter, I discharge a duty which has been too often projected &#x26; postponed. For some years, I have been an individual among the thousands to whom the arrival of an Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review is always a welcome occurrence: in the present instance, it is doubly delightful for being a delicate mark of <pb id="pg-01-183" n="01:183"/>attention from one, whose conversation might have done more for me than dispel the gloom of some otherwise unpleasant hours; and to whose principles I could desire, with so little reservation, that my own were similar.</p>
<p>In commencing a correspondence, which I trust neither of us will have cause to regret, I shall not detain you with reflections upon the slender means we possess of rendering it varied or interesting. Our intercourse with the world (scarcely greather than our knowledge of it) is without doubt, trifling; what little we have is not with the learned or the powerful, and our letters cannot be enlivened by the record &#x26; discussions of those events which agitate or instruct mankind. But the history of our studies, our opinions, our hopes, enterprises and disappointments&#x2014;the simple tho&#x2019; to us not indifferent events which mark the current of our life,&#x2014;offers a field, narrow indeed yet still worth cultivating, from which the talents and opportunities of a Walpole or a Grimm<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace Walpole (<date when="1717-00-00">1717</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797-00-00">97</date>), one of the most brilliant English letter writers; Baron Friedrich Melchior von Grimm (<date when="1723-00-00">1723</date>&#x2013;<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>), German critic whose correspondence in three volumes was published in <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1813-00-00">13</date>.</note> are not needed to extract both profit &#x26; amusement. With more propriety, I might supplicate your clemency for the dulness that must especially characterize the communications sent to you from this &#x201C;obscure sojourn.&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, III, 15.</note> Little experience, however, is wanted to convince us that the progress of ennui can no more be suspended by entreating its victim to be merry, than the conflagration at Bender could be quenched by <hi rend="italic">Karl der Zwolfte&#x2019;s</hi> barrel of brandy.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Voltaire&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Charles XII</hi>.</note> Waiving, therefore, all such prologues and apologies, let us proceed to more <hi rend="italic">edifying</hi> matters.</p>
<p>It seems scarcely doubtful, that, a minute narrative of my transactions since leaving you, would not suit <hi rend="italic">this</hi> division of our subject. They have been few and unimportant. Nor is there in my present situation any peculiarity, which, without lengthened description, you may not easily conceive. Like one &#x2018;long in populous city pent,&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, IX, 445.</note> I feel the benefit of country air in an improving state of health. I have been happy&#x2014;perhaps too happy, because too little disturbed about my future destiny. Yet now and then, the thought that, in a month or two, I must put to sea once more&#x2014;refitted certainly, but still without chart or compass, arises to interrupt my repose, with an aspect more threatening the more rarely it is seen. The question, what shall we do? has <pb id="pg-01-184" n="01:184"/>often been the theme which beguiled the tedium of our walks during winter: it may still be asked with anxiety and fear. The pursuit of wealth or other means of attracting the vulgar admiration is a littleness to which from our situation we are not much tempted. Other objects indeed have allurements for us: but if our abilities, such as they are, <hi rend="italic">have</hi> been doomed to augment the sum of those talents which from untoward circumstances can never benefit the world or the possessor of them;&#x2014;still considerations are not wanting, which,</p>
<lg><l>&#x2014;With a pleasing sorcery can charm</l>
<l>Pain for a while or anguish, and excite</l>
<l>Fallacious hope, <hi rend="italic">or arm th' obdured breast</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="italic">With stubborn patience as with triple steel</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., II, 566&#x2013;69.</note></l></lg>
<p>It is paying but a slight compliment to say, that, I often regret the want of your society. My friend Johnston (of whom I think you have heard) is gone to Annapolis Royal in Nova Scotia; and Mitchell, the only other person of an intellectual character whom I know in these parts, living at the distance of eight miles, I have few opportunities of seeing him. Some delight results from conversing with my brothers, whose opening minds I view with fraternal partiality: but the people in our neighbourhood are mostly peasants, and display the sentiments and habits usually met with in that race of men. Those in other stations are scarcely more refined. Possessing a fund of character and talents, by no means despicable, their want of commerce tends on many accounts to keep them ignorant and unenterprising; whilst the smuggling adventures of the bye-gone generation and the moss-trooping<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Raiding in the border country.</note> of more remote ones have left but too deep traces in their minds. With regard to our Gentry&#x2014;a stranger only would call it petulance to say, that their principles &#x26; pursuits are often little different from those &#x2018;vouchsafed to cattel and each beast.&#x2019;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, VIII, 581.</note> Their character, modified perhaps by that of the people, produces in its turn a strong and baneful reaction.&#x2014; But what have I to do with them or their pursuits? Did not I return from Dumfries last Sunday&#x2014;mounted on the back of a small Shelty&#x2014;loaded with a cargo of books from Johnston&#x2019;s circulating library? And in spite of Lady Morgan, Jeanne de France, Roderick the Goth<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Sidney Owenson Morgan (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), <hi rend="italic">France</hi> (London, <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>); Robert Southey (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), <hi rend="italic">Joan of Arc</hi> (Bristol, <date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>), <hi rend="italic">Roderick, the Last of the Goths</hi> (London, <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>).</note>&#x2014;to say nothing of magazines, and your Review (which otherwise <pb id="pg-01-185" n="01:185"/>I might not have seen for weeks), will the demon of solitude ever assail me with success?&#x2014; I do not like, it is true, to speak so freely of my <hi rend="italic">studies</hi>; the past is little else than a blank:&#x2014;May the future not resemble it!</p>
<p>Small sorrow, it must be owned, is excited in me at hearing of the indifference with which you viewed the squabbles of the General Assembly&#x2014;the worship of idols belonging to the <hi rend="italic">tribe</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">den</hi> is, doubtless, a pleasant exercise: it is also a debasing one; and feelings of complacency will naturally arise in the mind of him, who appears, after many a painful struggle, to have ascended, thro&#x2019; outer &#x26; thro&#x2019; middle darkness, to a station from whence he can look down with philosophical composure upon the selfishness and bigotry of the &#x2018;Stygian pool&#x2019;;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, III, 14.</note> confident that He who ruleth in the whirlwind<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Joseph Addison&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Campaign</hi>: &#x201C;And, pleased the Almighty&#x2019;s orders to perform, / Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm&#x201D; (II. 91&#x2013;92); Pope, <hi rend="italic">The Dunciad</hi>, III, 263&#x2013;64.</note> is directing even prejudice &#x26; superstition to do his errands of mercy among the sons of men. Abstractly considered, a number of persons met together to consult for the spiritual interests of millions is an imposing spectacle. Pity that its sublimity should have so often tended only to encrease the disgust, with which want of principle ought always to be regarded! To see the awful anticipations which seem to point out the eternal destiny of man, basely tampered with to gratify the interest or the passions of a few worthless individuals, whether assembled as an æcumenic council or a Parli<supplied>[ament]</supplied> session, may continue, for some ages, to provoke &#x2018;a sigh or a smile&#x2019; according to the humour of the spectator.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Even the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> found little to interest it in the proceedings of the General Assembly and reported (<date when="1819-06-05">5 June</date>) that they had &#x201C;been rather uncommonly barren of interest, though extremely well attended. What occurred on the last two days &#x2026; does not stimulate us.&#x201D; Such essential matters were discussed as the behavior of ministers and the reports of committees on education in prisons, on the poor law, on patronage, etc.</note></p>
<p>The condition of the Church you see affords me little satisfaction: that of the State, which reaches me, every Thursday, in the form of a poor greasy newspaper, is scarcely more exhilerating. You cannot be expected <hi rend="italic">like me</hi> to execrate the new taxes of vansittart; by which the poor artisan when his heart has been broken by exactions &#x26; penury (the fruit of our glorious campaigns) is at last denied the sad and sole resource&#x2014;a quid of wholesome tobacco! And what shall we say to that thing called privelege? If the custody of a Serjeant at Arms be a fit <pb id="pg-01-186" n="01:186"/>punishment for mistaking the meaning of a sentence; <hi rend="italic">what</hi> shall <hi rend="italic">he</hi> look for, whose brain of feathers has helped that country to the ruin which his heart of lead allows him to insult? But I have done.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nicholas Vansittart (<date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), Chancellor of the Exchequer (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1823-00-00">23</date>). A tax on tobacco had been levied this year. The charge of a breach of &#x201C;privilege&#x201D; had been made against a reporter of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, who had allegedly misquoted (or invented) some remarks of Joseph Hume on Canning, to the effect that &#x201C;there was but one Gentleman in the Ministry who could laugh at the misery of the poor, and that was one &#x2026; who, by arrogating to himself a privilege of laughing at the wretchedness of the lower classes, had been able to raise himself &#x2026; above their wants and miseries.&#x201D; Hume denied these words. The reporter was called to the bar of the House and reprimanded. (See the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1819-06-19">19 June</date>.)</note></p>
<p>You must send me, as soon as possible, a particular account of every thing pertaining to you. Do you ever see Irving? My best respects to him. Is Gibson, the Cumbrian philosopher,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably an Edinburgh classmate.</note> still in the body?

<salute>Dear Fergusson,</salute>
<p>I wrote a letter some time ago, which I hope you have received, and intend shortly to answer. To quicken your movements in that matter is not, however, the sole cause which has induced me to address you at present.</p>
<p>There resides a certain medical student, in this neighbourhood, by name Mr Johnston,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Johnston, brother of James.

Being in want of books, he came to me two days ago with a request that I would endeavour to procure him some of that necessary material, from the College library. Upon considering the means, which I possessed of gratifying the young man&#x2019;s laudable desire, I agreed to write to you upon the subject;&#x2014;persuaded that you will not grudge to devote an hour of your time to the aid of an amiable person, whose zeal for study,&#x2014;especially among the <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;fable folk&#x2019;</hi> that rival or encourage him,&#x2014;is altogether praiseworthy. But if you should happen to feel any <hi rend="italic">scruples</hi> about signing the name (for which, however, you have its owner&#x2019;s authority) or transacting any other part of the business in quest<supplied>[ion]</supplied> [next word blotted] making a very ungenerous use of the desire, which you will feel of obliging me, to offer <supplied>[next two or three words blotted: ag]</supplied>ainst your returning the inclosed tickets &#x26; money, without proceeding farther in the affair. &#x2018;But I hope better things tho&#x2019; I thus speak.&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cant expression of Scottish preachers.

<p>I have not taken up the pen, my dear Mitchell, because of being smit with the love of sacred letterwriting; but simply to acquit me of a debt, which for some time has lain rather heavy on my conscience. An ancient sage philosopher has said that nothing should be done <foreign><hi rend="italic">invit&#xE2; Minerv&#xE2;</hi></foreign>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;<foreign>Nihil decet invita Minerva</foreign>&#x201D;</hi>: &#x201C;Nothing is becoming, against the will of Minerva&#x201D; (Cicero, <hi rend="italic">De Divinatione</hi>, II, xxxviii, 80).</note> my respect for antiquity is very considerable; but without infringing such precepts, which laziness also raises her amiable voice to applaud, my terrestrial exploits would quickly have a close. After all, this communication by letter gives occassion to many squabbles between the moral &#x26; the active powers: I wish from my soul, some less laborious mode of friendly intercourse could be devised. Much may be done in the flight of ages. I despair of steam indeed; notwithstanding its felicitous application to so many useful purposes: but who can limit the undiscovered agents with which Knowledge is yet to enrich Philanthropy? Charming prospect for the dull, above all, the <pb id="pg-01-189" n="01:189"/>solitary dull of future times! Small comfort for us, however, who in no great fraction of one age shall need to care nothing about the matter. But wherefore whine? Employing rather our own very limited gifts, <foreign><hi rend="italic">agamus pingui Minerv&#xE2;, ut aiunt</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;<foreign>Agamus igitur pingui, ut aiunt, Minerva</foreign>&#x201D;</hi>: &#x201C;Let us bring to bear our plain mother wit&#x201D; (Cicero, <hi rend="italic">De Amicitia</hi>, V, 19).</note>&#x2014;since we can have no other.</p>
<p>The best quality which I can communicate to the narrative of my journey to Cumberland<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle planned to see James Johnston sail from Liverpool to Nova Scotia, but the sailing was delayed and they took a walking tour in the vicinity of Workington, Cumberland, on the south shore of the Derwent.</note> is extreme brevity. In fact, however strongly a love of the sublime might tempt me to renew the kind anxiety, you felt on our account, the love of truth, which is or ought to be more powerful, compels me to declare that nothing dangerous or wonderful occurred. Maugre the predictions of your light bodied grocer,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See RM to TC, <date when="1819-06-11">11 June</date>: &#x201C;with a dapper little personage who from his blackened shoes, well brushed green Coat and consequential air I conjectured to be some vender of Tea and Sugar &#x2026; exclaiming&#x2014; &#x2018;there she goes Six and twenty Souls in her&#x2014;a half too many for that small boat&#x2014; &#x2026; faith,<supplied>[']</supplied> he added, with a shrug indicative of his happier lot, <supplied>[&#x2018;]</supplied>I should not like to be in her.<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>&#x201D;</note> the Skinburness wherry buffetted the billous of the

We had not even the dubious pleasure of being frightened. A poor Cumbrian <hi rend="italic">statesman</hi>, however, enjoyed a more spirit-stirring fortune. Unused to his situation, he cast a penetrating glance upon &#x2018;the secrets of the hoary deep&#x2019;;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marcus Aurelius Antonius, <hi rend="italic">Meditations</hi>, II, 13.</note> his visage became pallid and elongated; and when, turning round, he noticed the entrance of a spoonful of spray&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Lock,&#x2019;</hi> he exclaimed in a sepulchral tone, <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Lock prasarve us! si as its coomin join&#x2019; in theare</hi></foreign> [see how it&#x2019;s rushing in there]!&#x2019;&#x2014; But the lapse of two hours delivered him from all his terrors.&#x2014; On arriving at Workington, next morning, the Severn, we were told, was not to proceed on her voyage, for a week. Tho' wishing to enjoy the melancholy satisfaction of seeing Johnston fairly under way; yet, when Friday came, and (Harrington, Whitehaven, Cockermouth, Crummock-water &#x26;c being visited) this day of sailing was still at a considerable distance&#x2014;the opportunity of a Dumfries sloop induced me to take farewell of our friendly emigrant. What my feelings were, that afternoon, I need not describe. To some days of mournful excitement, a sort of stupor had succeeded, which the noise of two half-civilized shipmen and the task of <hi rend="italic">guessing</hi> at <pb id="pg-01-190" n="01:190"/>some stanzas of Tasso were little calculated to dispel. By this time, poor James is most probably inspecting the rugged shores of Fundy Bay. Let us hope that his talents and those virtues which are their modest ornament will secure, from the Acadians, that affection &#x26; esteem, which all who know him have never failed to pay. I do not wish you to convince me, that, we three shall never meet again, under more benign auspices&#x2014;</p>
<p>Since my return, except one journey to Dumfries which I undertook for the purpose of engaging a supply of poetry, reviews and such small gear, during my continuance in these parts,&#x2014;I have not been four miles from home. Jardine gives me a solitary lesson, each week, in German; which I repay by one in French. Of Italian nothing should be said: and with respect to Lesage&#x2019;s theory of attraction<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Louis Lesage (<date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>), Swiss mathematician and doctor, famous principally for his work on gravitation and for his theory which related the attraction of bodies to each other to the continuous collision of particles arriving from all parts of the universe at once. He was crowned by the Acad&#xE9;mie de Rouen in <date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>.</note> my efforts are feeble and far between. I know not if there be a Goddess of Sloth&#x2014;tho&#x2019; considering that this of all our passions is the least turbulent and most victorious, it could not without partiality be left destitute&#x2014; But if there be, she certainly looks on with an approving smile&#x2014;when in a supine posture, I lie for hours with my eyes fixed upon the pages of Lady Morgan&#x2019;s France or the travels of Faujas St Fond<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Barth&#xE9;lemy Faujas de Saint-Fond (<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>&#x2013;<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>), <hi rend="italic">Voyage en Angleterre, en &#xc9;cosse et aux Iles H&#xE9;brides</hi> &#x2026; , 2 vols.

What shall I say to the woebegone Roderick last of the Goths; and others of a similar stamp? They go through my brain as light goes thro&#x2019; an achromatic telescope. When even this task becomes tiresome; or when the need of exercise (which I never neglect for a day with impunity) induces me to take the fields; I saunter about, building deceitful hopes; or when otherwise disposed, indulging an obdured recklessness, which I am apt enough to dignify with the name of patience.&#x2014; Do you know of a more edifying life? Seriously, it becomes you, as my Father Confessor to administer an appropriate rebuke.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>By this time, I suppose, you are quietly settled in your native valley;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Conachan, Glenalmond, is in Perthshire.</note> glad to have escaped, for a season, the eating cares of pedagogy; and to have exchanged the heartless gossipping of dull loungers, the dust, the sin &#x26; sea-coal of Edinburgh, for mountain breezes and the simple affectionate communing of true friends. It may perhaps diversify without suspending your enjoyment to turn your thoughts hither for a little while. I am aware, that, Johnstone&#x2019;s thanks and mine should have been transmitted to you some fortnight sooner: but the old causes, aggravated by a torrid atmosphere, which to judge from my nerves, could not be much short of 212&#xB0; Fa<supplied>[h]</supplied>renheit, have hitherto frustrated my well-meant endeavours. All things considered, you ought to be well satisfied.</p>
<p>The life, which I have led, for some time, cannot well bear much description. It is of that peaceful kind which furnishes few materials for a narrative. Moderate health, domestic kindness, uninterrupted leisure are the elements of my condition: and whether I read the Abb&#xE9; Raynal, or stroll into the fields to muse over Skiddaw and his ancient brethren; to look at the Solway and the yellow hills and dales which intervene; or to enjoy &#x2018;the sweet approach of even,&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, III, 42.</note> when the Sun sinks behind the cone of Queensberry&#x2014;the day glides gently along, undisturbed by <foreign>ennui</foreign>, tho&#x2019; unvaried except by incidents too trivial to be remembered much less detailed. You may imagine such a state very favourable for intellectual, if not for moral, improvement: but the painful truth is, I derive too little advantage from it. One cardinal error, which I have long lamented, is the want of any plan in my researches. Indolence and the love of novelty may plead that knowledge of all <pb id="pg-01-193" n="01:193"/>kinds is valuable; and exultingly point to Stewart&#x2019;s &#x2018;literary artisan&#x2019;: it remains certain, that reading, when thus conducted, is too often more like dissipation than study&#x2014; But without any profession or distinct prospects how shall this evil be remedied? Unfortunately, the precept &#x2018;whatsoever thy hand findeth <supplied>[to]</supplied> do, do it with all thy might&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccles. 9:10.</note>&#x2014;a palliative at any rate and not a cure&#x2014;is more easily assented to than put in practice. I have much need of your advice upon this head; for as things go, philology, fiction, metaphysics and history are very oddly jumbled in my poor head&#x2014; The German still maintains a dubious footing; Jardine comes once a-week; but alas! he is not an Adelung;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Christoph Adelung (<date when="1732-00-00">1732</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>), German philologist and grammarian.</note> and my own efforts have been so far from persevering, that, I can yet obtain only an imperfect idea of a scene in the <hi rend="italic">Misstrauische</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Der Misstrauische. Lustspiel in F&#xfc;nf Aufz&#xfc;gen</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, vol.

Either the literature of that country little merits the praises which it has received, or my selection of German books has been singularly unfortunate.

My operations in Italian have been limited to six pages of Tasso.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Torquato Tasso (<date when="1544-00-00">1544</date>&#x2013;<date when="1595-00-00">95</date>), <hi rend="italic">La Gerusalemme Liberata</hi> (<date when="1575-00-00">1575</date>). See also <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210604-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1821-06-04">4 June 1821</date>.</ref></note> What think you of a project which I have formed? We two are to rise at 7 o&#x2019;clock every morning, throughout winter, and read together Italian one day, Greek the other. I think we once spoke of Greek before: can our intentions not be executed? Without believing in the creed of Oxford, we may be allowed, for many reasons, to regret that, in our own boasted seminaries, an ability to relish the sages and poets of Greece, &#x2018;to unsphere the
spirit of Plato&#x2019;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Il Penseroso,&#x201D; l. 89.</note> in his native garb&#x2014;is so very rarely attained. But it is a pitiful thing to be mourning all one&#x2019;s life for the want of a language, when a competent knowledge of it might be obtained in a few months. Consider this proposal before you write. I may not detain you with the Tales of my Landlord.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Sir Walter Scott, published in four volumes in Edinburgh, <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>.</note> They are unpopular I hear; from which one might infer that the public has been spoiled with an excess of dainty food.

(<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>).</note> or other of the same stamp. Above a month ago, I found Raynal&#x2019;s history of the E. and W. Indies,<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published in <date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>.</note> in a farmer&#x2019;s house of this neighbourhood. It were long to tell you fully my opinion of this work, which (according to Gibbon) the author, by a happy audacity, names philosophical as well as political. The Abb&#xE9;&#x2019;s researches embrace almost the whole habitable globe; his narrative, too much chequered by boisterous speculations, is generally conducted in a distinct, easy manner; and the information communicated upon physical, commercial and moral topics is various, and I believe reckoned authentic, tho&#x2019; no authorities are quoted. Abundantly free from puritanism of any sort, he possesses an acute and cultivated understanding, a fervid imagination, an indignant rather than a forcible character. Opposite the title-page, beneath the picture of a sullen thoughtful countenance, Sterne&#x2019;s Eliza Draper<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The widow of an Indian merchant, she carried on a violent sentimental flirtation with Sterne about <date when="1767-00-00">1767</date>. She is the Eliza of the posthumous <hi rend="italic">Letters from Yorick to Eliza</hi> (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>).</note> has written: William Thomas Raynal, defender of truth, humanity and liberty. An enlightened admirer of those sacred qualities, may respect the genius and principles of Raynal, with<supplied>[out]</supplied> forgetting to lament that his denunciations against tyranny &#x26; priestcraft so frequently over step the moderation of philosophy. By way of punishing any aristocratic prejudices, which you may have contracted among those Celtic clans, I send you the concluding volley of his attack on the education of Kings. <foreign>&#x2018;Heureusement leurs insti<supplied>[tu]</supplied>teurs pervers sont t&#xF4;t ou tard chati&#xE9;s par l'ingratitude ou par le m&#xE9;pris de leurs &#xE9;leves.

<p>Before my sheet is exhausted, I ought to mention, that, probably about the beginning of <date when="1819-11-00">November</date>, you will see me in Edinburgh. I look forward to my arrival in town, with feelings similar to those of a bather contemplating, from his sunny slope, the dark pool, that is soon to receive him. Something must be done; but what or how is not so evident. I continue to participate in your dislike of teaching, the miseries of which are sufficiently obvious&#x2014;unhappily the means of avoiding it are less so. It is matter of regret rather than surprise that you have yet sent nothing to the press. The difficulties of such an undertaking I have found to augment, as the execution of it approaches&#x2014; Yet let us not despair. We are young; and the world, which is all before us,<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, XII, 646.</note> will not refuse to patient efforts, the little that we want from it. You must write to me as soon as possible: and make no more apologies for dulness than I do. Your letter is the best I have got for some time; and it had a value independent of its literary merits.&#x2014; The pen being in my hand, I was about to send Irving a letter, but intelligence has reached me, that, he was to arrive at Annan on Saturday.

<salute>Dear Fergusson,</salute>
<p>An affairs of business merely, which the sight of the accompanying books will sufficiently explain, gives rise to this letter. The books which Mr Johnston, with many acknowledgements for your past kindness, requests you to procure for him, are the three nearest the beginning of a list which I shall enclose. I declare myself almost ashamed to trouble you again: but I cannot find in my heart to refuse the poor young man. Perhaps I should have trespassed upon your good nature in a similar way, for my own account; but there is a certain entanglement among the receipts, which I cannot think of afflicting you withal:&#x2014;and, to speak the naked truth, I have not read all the volumes which I carried with me&#x2014;nor will I apparently make the attempt, till the time be past. Coxe<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William Coxe (<date when="1747-00-00">1747</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>), English historian.</note> has had <hi rend="italic">one</hi> day devoted to him; and Father Boscovich<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the <hi rend="italic">Philosophiae Naturalis Theoria Redacta ad Unicam Legem Virium in Natura Existientium</hi> (Vienna, <date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>), of Ruggiero Gius&#xE8;ppi Boscovich (<date when="1711-00-00">1711</date>&#x2013;<date when="1787-00-00">87</date>).</note> has exposed his gilt back to my eyes, for five months, constantly, in vain&#x2014; Laziness, irresolution or&#x2014;but I make no comments. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Homo sum</hi></foreign> [I am a man].</p>
<p>It is past my usual hour of going to sleep, my pen (as you observe) writes very ill, and my unfortunate brain is entirely desiccated with the labour of reading Goethe and scratching Teutonic characters: from all which I intend to infer the propriety of briefly closing this ill-omen<supplied>[e]</supplied>d sheet. The letter which I dispatched to the mountains of Perthshire will most probably have reached you: and my situation since the date of that production has undergone no change. I was much grieved to learn, about a week ago, the cause of your premature departure from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. I cannot forbid myself to hope that your Mother is recovered, tho&#x2019; my ignorance is the only ground of such a supposition. It is not difficult to sympathize with the distress, which a <pb id="pg-01-197" n="01:197"/>contrary event must occassion. The name of mother will awaken many thoughts in every heart: but it becomes us to reflect that in a short space this best of friends will be separated from us by the &#x2018;cold obstruction&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Measure for Measure</hi>, III, i.</note> of the grave; and to indulge the hope that in another undiscovered country,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, i.</note> the severed links of nature may be joined again forever. I discard these melancholy ideas, for the belief (prudent in existing circumstances) that all is well.</p>
<p>Edward Irving was the bearer of the ungrateful intelligence, to which I have just alluded. I spent three or four days with him last week. He had not seen Fingal&#x2019;s cave,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A famous cave on the island of Staffa.</note> but in recompense he had examined the peasants and the clergy of Ulster; the Giant&#x2019;s causeway the city of Derry, and other strange objects.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >All places in northern Ireland.</note> His stay in Colerain<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A market town about thirty-three miles northeast of Londonderry.</note> might have been protracted, had not a letter from Dr Chalmers recalled him to Glasgow, where he finally engaged (if a month<supplied>[&#x2019;s]</supplied> probation should be favourable) to serve as that Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> person&#x2019;s assistant in discharging the complicated duties of St John&#x2019;s parish. The Doctor&#x2019;s application originated from a sermon which he heard our friend deliver in Thomson&#x2019;s church.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The church of Dr. Andrew Thomson (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>). See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210309-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1821-03-09">9 March 1821</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280312-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1828-03-12">12 March 1828</date></ref>.</note> You will rejoice with me that Irving, has in so honourable a way, obtained admittance to the career, whither his principles and feelings have long been exclusively directed. He has a fair field: and if (somewhat contrary to my hopes) his fervid genius do not prompt him into extravagancies, from which more stupid and less honest preachers are exempted, his success, I doubt not, will be brilliant. He was humble but not undesirous to prove himself, last monday, when I accompanied him a few miles on his way. Bid good speed to poor Irving; and pray that neither the absurd nostrums, which Dr C. intends to apply forthwith, to the Glasgow weavers, nor any other obstacle may thwart his well-meant endeavours.</p>
<p>The same day, I saw Frank Dixon. He has been sick of a fever, for three weeks; but is recovering pretty rapidly. Tho' he still seems unhealthy, he talks of being in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> shortly. If you are not tired of this newsmongering&#x2014;you may learn, that, James Brown is likely to become assistant &#x26; successor in the parish of Hawick or of Westerkirk.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He did not.</note> [Carlyle writes and then crosses out: And what have I to do <pb id="pg-01-198" n="01:198"/>with Hawick or Westerkirk you ask.

<p>Will you write me immediately? Not the note solely that will of course come with the books; but a very long account of all your speculations.

<p>John Welsh died <date when="1819-09-19">19 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1819</date>; after an illness of only four days: fever caught from a poor old woman whom he had charitably taken charge of, &#x2014;and who, I think, recovered. He was in his 44th or 45th year; in the prime of his strength and activity; one whom all witnesses report to me as a man of sterling integrity, uncommon insight, fidelity and ingenuity in his Professn,&#x2014;extensively a Helper of his Fellow Creatures, not willingly a Hinderer of any. Evid<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> to me a noble, sympathetic, valiant, clear and luminous man. His eldest Sister mentioned to me last year (<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>), what I had not known before, that he was of noble and disting<hi rend="italic">d</hi> presence withal, tall, lightly graceful, self-possessed, spontaneously dignified,&#x2014;so that people, if he entered a theatre or the like, asked Who is it?&#x2014; &#x201C;a face like y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> late Wife&#x2019;s,&#x201D; it was added, &#x201C;black hair, bright-hazel eyes, bright, prompt-looking, beaming features, pale pure complexn, if we <hi rend="italic">translate</hi> all that into the masculine.&#x201D; His Daughter was not admitted to the sick-room; sat on the stairs close by. To the last, hopes were strong; fever gone, said all the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Drs: but, alas, the strength too was gone. She herself believed, all her life, that his youngest Broth<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, the &#x201C;Benjamin&#x201D; aft<hi rend="italic">ds</hi> soon to be mentioned, was the involuntary cause of his death, by far too copious bleeding in the earliest stages<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>Two weeks and two days after the event this Letter was written. To those who knew her, and what the event was to her, a sudden plunging of her hitherto bright and altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> happy and beautiful existence into blackness of total eclipse from wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it never wholly recovered, this Letter is abund<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> pathetic; to me especially who know her common tone in regard to death &#x26; the like, it is painfully so,&#x2014;heightened into my pain, and the image of utter bereave<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, by the <hi rend="italic">religious</hi> expressions I find here! Such feelings she had in her degree; but in her noble instincts of veracity, in her perfect avoidance of cant, she seldom or never gave utterance utterance [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to them; felt that they were not fit for utterance in words. Myself she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> answer only by her look on such occas<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, look still eloquent to me; but, in spite of my evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> wishes almost never otherwise. In her Letters, this (to a <pb id="pg-01-203" n="01:203"/><hi rend="italic">religious</hi> Grandm<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, as may be noted too) is the first and the last instance I have met with.&#x2014; The Letter was sent to me by her Aunts, in <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>, soon after my irretrievable calamity.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>At length I have leisure to devote a few minutes to the duty of detailing the particulars of my history, since our parting on the summit of Erock-stane.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170925-TC-JJ-01">TC to JJ, <date when="1817-09-25">25 Sept. 1817</date></ref>.</note> Shortly after that event, I overtook the inquisitive idiot &#x26; with him the home-bound &#x2018;drover,&#x2019; when I had ignorantly mistaken for a <hi rend="italic">trogger</hi>, and you for an &#x2018;accursed palmer.&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A <hi rend="italic">trogger</hi> is a peddler. A <hi rend="italic">palmer</hi> is a tramp or vagrant.</note> They journeyed with me to Tweed-hope-foot;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> is a valley in the hills.</note> but the conversation of these personages is very little worth repeating. The last words, which the natural spoke, were that it would be no rain to-day; and scarcely were they utterred, when a fall commenced, and lasted with little intermission, 'till a late hour of the evening. Wet weather is not good to travel in; no more, are dirty roads; but to every ill there is a worse; and I consoled myself by reflecting that had the wind been in my face, and the roads eighteen inches deep instead of two, my progress must have been suspended altogether. As things happened it was impeded merely; for between five &#x26; six o&#x2019;clock, I arrived at Broughton-inn, tired indeed but scarcely wet, and whole in lith <supplied>[joint]</supplied> and limb. Many an anxious <pb id="pg-01-205" n="01:205"/>thought did I send after Jack and the cattle: but what did thoughts avail? I long to be informed that you got home without damage.&#x2014; Broughton-inn, I take to be one of the worst in the British empire. The servants and the usual guests seem not to know cleanliness even by name; fire exists nowhere but in the kitchen, &#x26; were their victuals as nutritive as they are indigestible, a man might fatten on a meal per day&#x2014; Tired of smoking in silence, I asked for a bed before seven o&#x2019;clock, and having with some dexterity contrived to hang my clothes upon two perches that arose from the bottom of my only chair&#x2014;sad remnants of a back that had belonged to it many years ago, I lay down upon a bed which if not so clean, was yet a little (tho&#x2019; but a little) softer than the <hi rend="italic">oaken couches</hi>, used in the days of good Queen Bess. So I slept soundly till four o&#x2019;clock. Not to trouble you farther with unimportant particulars, it will be enough to add that I baited at Noblehouse;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18140618-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1814-06-18">18 [June] 1814</date></ref>.</note> and, after a not very uncomfortable walk, reached this old city, yesterday about three o&#x2019;clock. Mrs Duff had a room empty, but which could not be let till after eight days. Unable to find another lodging to my mind, I slept in her house, and after break-fast, renewed my search (this morning) for a comfortable <hi rend="italic">up-putting</hi>. I was in many rooms of various qualities; and at last after investigating all circumstances, I am seated in the back-room of a Mrs Thomson (wife of a Tailor) which I rent at the rate of 6/ per week, fire included. This person seems to have a good character in the neighbourhood; &#x26; from the few symptoms, I have yet been able to observe, it appears likely that I shall be very snug here. The room is not large, but it is clean,&#x2014;and the neat little landlady says it is perfectly free of smoke &#x26; of most detested <hi rend="italic">bugs</hi>.</p>
<p>Thus, my dear Jack, have I written for thy friendly perusal, a full account of my transactions up to this date. The Waffler (well he deserves that <foreign><hi rend="italic">nom de guerre</hi></foreign>!) is not yet come to town; so that being unable to transact any business, I have full leisure to reflect upon every part of my condition. Pretty strong in body &#x26; capable, as I know, of vigorous effort, I am far from despairing. However, as I have nothing new to tell you upon this subject, I forbear to discuss it farther for the present. Let us be contented, my <foreign>bonny</foreign> boy, prudent, active, resolute in improving <hi rend="italic">every</hi> advantage which our situation affords&#x2014;and moderate success is hardly doubtful.</p>
<p>9 o&#x2019;clock. P.M.</p>
<p>After an interval of 5 hours, spent in reading the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review <pb id="pg-01-206" n="01:206"/>and executing various commissions, I resume my lucubrations. The unhappy carrier is not come. What can it be that keeps him? Is his steed foundered&#x2014;or himself overpowered with liquor? Alas! poor Rose!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the horse of the Waffler&#x2014;George Farries, the carrier. On the other hand, Carlyle could have had in mind Don Quixote&#x2019;s horse Rosinante. A <hi rend="italic">waffler</hi> is a weak, undecided person.</note></p>
<p>At this time, I guess, Alick and the rest of you are seated around the <hi rend="italic">room</hi>-fire&#x2014;each pursuing his respective study. Good luck to you all! Be diligent and you will not miss your reward. Tell the small <hi rend="italic">childer</hi> that I expect copies from them all, next box,&#x2014;letters from all that have <hi rend="italic">any</hi> powers of diction, and have advanced beyond the <hi rend="italic">strokes</hi> in the art of writing.</p>
<p>Having scarcely spoken to any one since my arrival, I have none of that much-coveted commodity, news, to send you. The burghers of this city are, for most part, minding their private affairs; and the few of them who take any share in public transactions, are occupied, as elsewhere, in talking about the massacre of Manchester,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Manchester, or Peterloo, Massacre occurred on <date when="1819-08-16">16 Aug.</date> The Whig <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> protested that &#x201C;the conduct of coroners and police magistrates, since the unhappy affair occurred, has kept every wound fresh. &#x2026; It is this busy, interfering, over-zealous and officious spirit, which, along with the prevailing distresses, has inflamed the public mind&#x201D; (<date when="1819-10-09">9 Oct.</date>). The Ministers were treating &#x201C;a few thousand borough holders &#x2026; as the nation; while the mass of the community &#x2026; have been regarded as a nameless rabble&#x201D; (<date when="1819-10-16">16 Oct.</date>).</note> and the foolish Carlile&#x2019;s<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Carlile (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), freethinker, disciple of Thomas Paine, tinsmith, author and editor of radical papers, had just been sentenced to a fine of &#xa3; 1,500 and three years&#x2019; imprisonment for blasphemous libels, including the publication of Paine&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Age of Reason</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> regretted its publication but deplored its having led to an &#x201C;open trial &#x2026; at the present crisis, since &#x2026; an unmerited prejudice will be excited against all men of liberal sentiments.&#x201D;</note> conduct at his trial. The distress under which the universal kingdom suffers seems not to be felt in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;to the extent that it is likely ere long to reach. Already however there is much poverty among the lowest orders; and the issue of this crisis seems anxiously anticipated by all. For the rest, <hi rend="italic">dandies</hi> and cattle of that stamp are still in considerable force; but you &#x26; I have other things to do than take up our time with them.</p>
<p>Have you got Hume yet? Does Geo: Johnston come to get his French lesson from you? Try the Latin, if he come: you are sure to make progress in it; most probably it will turn to good account for you, and any way, it is a wholesome adage that says: Can do is easily carried about with one. Again let me renew my often repeated desire that you will punctually attend to your writing. I must send your <hi rend="italic">lines</hi>&#x2014; <pb id="pg-01-207" n="01:207"/>unless I forget&#x2014;as I did to give you the money last Tuesday 'till I was several miles from you, when it was utterly useless to deplore my negligence. <closer><salute>Send me your copy to inspect any way</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mitchell,</salute>
<p>Without reluctance, I push aside the massy quarto of Millar on the English government,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Millar (<date when="1735-00-00">1735</date>&#x2013;<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>), <hi rend="italic">An Historical View of the English Government</hi> (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>).</note> to perform the more pleasing duty of writing a few lines to you, by the conveyance of Mr Duncan. No material event has been added to my history, since the day when I parted with you at the avenue of Cummertrees: but by scribbling upon some portion of this sheet, I expect to secure the advantage of hearing from you in return; and independently of this, if my labour do no good, the comfort is, it can do little ill.</p>
<p>I reached what certain persons have been pleased to call &#x2018;the intellectual city,&#x2019; on the afternoon of yesterday-week.&#x2014; The country of Tweedsmuir, you have often heard me say, is the most mournful in Europe. Rugged, without being elevated; barren, stormy, and covered, at least in winter, with an ever-brooding darkness, it seems a fit haunt for the harrassed fanatics,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Covenanters.</note> who tenanted it in the seventeenth century. I never crossed this dismal region, without melancholy, bitter recollections of the good which I had left; and forebodings of the evil I was likely to meet with: in short, if Trophonius<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Worshipped after death at a cave in Boeotia, a dismal country.</note> should ever think of setting up in the world again; I would have him leave far behind the vales of Thessaly&#x2014;however tempting they may seem; and dig his grotto, in some <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> of this &#x2018;dark Cimmerian desart.&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;L'Allegro,&#x201D; l. 10.</note>&#x2014;you may wonder why I so vehemently abuse this &#x2018;excellent sheep country&#x2019;: I cannot say&#x2014;unless that on Tuesday the roads were very bad &#x26; the weather <pb id="pg-01-208" n="01:208"/>very wet; and according to David Hume <hi rend="italic">contiguity in time or place</hi> is a principle of association among our ideas.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hume says this in his <hi rend="italic">A Treatise of Human Nature</hi>, I, iv.</note></p>
<p>Since my arrival in Edinburgh, the employment of waiting for carriers, travelling to Fife &#x26;c has consumed most part of my time. On Tuesday-morning, the benevolent Mr Duncan carried me to Bailie Waugh&#x2019;s.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281211-TCJWC-HI-01"><sic>TC</sic><corr>TC and JWC</corr> to HI, <date when="1828-12-11">11 Dec. 1828</date></ref>.</note> This worshipful magistrate seems (under the rose) to be a very flimsy vapouring sort of character. I left him my address; and shall probably hear no more of him. With regard to your most kind Minister&#x2014;my circumstances qualify me but poorly for doing any justice to the feeling which his conduct is calculated to excite. Even to you, I cannot enter upon this subject.&#x2014; Yesternight I enrolled in the class of Scots law. The Professor Dr Hume,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18191229-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1819-12-29">29 Dec.</date></ref></note> a nephew of the philosopher already mentioned, speaks in a voice scarce audible; and his thinking has yet to shew all its points of similarity with the penetrating genius of his uncle. Yet I prophecy that I shall not dislike the science. If health continue, I shall feel for it, all the ardour which is naturally inspired by the prospect (however dubious) of its affording a permanent direction to my efforts: I shall require, moreover, to investigate, the history, antiquities, manners &#x26;c of our native country&#x2014;a subject for which I feel nothing like repugnance: and for the details of the subject&#x2014;six years of solitary reading (would it had been <hi rend="italic">study</hi>!) have given me a most courageous indifference to the <hi rend="italic">magnitude</hi> of any folio, capable of being lifted without the aid of the mechanical powers. My fear at the present is even that I shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be able to procure a copy of Erskine&#x2019;s
institutes.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Institutes of the Laws of Scotland</hi> (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>), by John Erskine (<date when="1695-00-00">1695</date>&#x2013;<date when="1768-00-00">1768</date>), professor of Scottish law at Edinburgh University from <date when="1737-00-00">1737</date> to <date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>.</note> But next time I write, you shall know more particularly about these affairs&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have not seen Dr Brewster, because he was not in town, till this day&#x2014; His journal<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</hi> had been founded by Dr. David Brewster and Robert Jameson. It ran from <date when="1819-10-00">Oct. 1819</date> to <date when="1824-04-00">April 1824</date>.</note> appears to be in a sickly state. Few speak of it; and those few without respect.</p>
<p>There is little that I can tell you respecting the news civil or literary of these parts, which Mr Duncan will not be much better qualified to lay before you. I heard Leslie once only&#x2014; Desirous, it would appear, of beating Chalmers on his own ground, he is said to have been greatly distinguished this season for the <hi rend="italic">piety</hi> of his opening <pb id="pg-01-209" n="01:209"/>lectures. When I was there, he spoke of many philosophers &#x26; their deeds from <hi rend="italic">Hipparchus</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Malus</hi> <note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hipparchus (<hi rend="italic">ca</hi>. <date>160</date>&#x2013;<date>125 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), Greek astronomer; &#xc9;tienne Louis Malus (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>), French physicist and optics expert.</note> inclusive, in a pompous stile&#x2014;somewhat in Gibbon&#x2019;s vein&#x2014;except that Gibbon is seldom tawdry.&#x2014; Wallace,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Wallace, professor of mathematics at Edinburgh University from <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date> to <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>, a self-educated man who published widely on mathematical subjects and invented the eidograph, a form of the pantograph.</note> whom I went this day to see, is a person about fifty years old&#x2014;short, bald-headed with a grim and intelligent countenance. His manner is blunt; he speaks with a Scotch accent;&#x2014;and if his unaffected &#x26; patient demeanour is accompanied with a display of philosophical reflection&#x2014;which I cannot assert or deny&#x2014;he ought surely to be a great favourite with the public. Leslie and he are said to be on the eve of
battle&#x2014;for the Elements of Geometry<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Leslie&#x2019;s work by this name.</note> and curves of the second order, are to be discarded for Playfair&#x2019;s Euclid!<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Playfair&#x2019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Elements of Geometry</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>).</note> Love me, love my dog&#x2014;the saw says: still more should it say, love me, love my book.

<p>But I must quit these lucubrations&#x2014; Tell me very soon what progress you make in Crombey; give me an order to get you Lipsius, either of the Scaligers, Causabon or the neverdying Ernesti,<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Crombie (<date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), author of works in philosophy, science, classics, and

Seriously though, I think your study of classical literature likely to benefit you.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I am very much satisfied, as may well be supposed, to hear that thou and the cattle got safely home&#x2014;tho&#x2019; faint, yet persevering. I have only to hope that nothing sustained any serious injury by that adventure. Most probably you are already come home from Cumberland: I trust, you and our cousin (to whom give my best love) were pleased with the beautiful, tho&#x2019; at this season prostrate, aspect of that interesting county. You have no doubt resumed your occupations; and at this hour (6 o&#x2019;clock) I suppose are &#x2018;forming the circle&#x2019; around your cheerful fire&#x2014;to teach, and to be taught. Innocent group! peace be with you all!</p>
<p>To me it is good news that you and Geo Johnstone<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both became doctors.</note> are studying together. Whatever thy hand findeth to d<supplied>[o,]</supplied> do it with all thy might&#x2014;is a good maxim, when applied in moderation [tear in paper] is most [tear]-ly improved&#x2014;write a copy <hi rend="italic">every</hi> night, [tear] will actually be a <hi rend="italic">very good</hi> penman&#x2014; I can give you [tear] about your path in life&#x2014;my own situation is dubious &#x26; fluctu<supplied>[ating: tear]</supplied> an advice to which many years have given the sanction of experience is that the pursuit of useful information is an honourable one, and the attainment of it (next to that of virtuous habits) the noblest which a mortal can atchieve.&#x2014; I have very little time to enter into particulars about my studies which indeed are yet (alas!) hardly begun. I am at the Scots law class; and the professor (a nephew of the historian Hume) is most perspicuous; but law is to me an untrodden path, and much toil will be requisite for mastering it. Yet I fear <hi rend="italic">that</hi> little. I have got four very ponderous <pb id="pg-01-211" n="01:211"/>quartos of notes taken, from these lectures, in shorthand&#x2014;they promise to be of much use to me. I have read Millar on the English government &#x26;c&#x2014; The notes came from Hill (my comarade for a part of last winter): perhaps I shall send these letters in the box, which once held these <hi rend="italic">learned</hi> papers. But I must have done, Jack&#x2014; Remember me in the most kind manner to Mag, Jemmy, Mary, Jean and little Jenny. Tell all of them to write me that can write.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Having set out this day about half-past twelve o&#x2019;clock, as my custom is, to get the fresh air, I proceeded in an hour to the law class and upon returning at 3, I found that Geordy<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Farries, the Ecclefechan carrier.</note> had exceeded my expectations, and brought the box even before the appointed time. My dinner was to eat, and fifty things to do beside: you
must therefore excuse the briefness of this poor half-sheet, and trust that another time, I shall be more circumstantial.</p>
<p>I was truly sorry and at the same time tickled to observe the abrupt conclusion of your letter. The thunder of Jack&#x2019;s snoring is not unknown to me; but, poor fellow!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Poor fellow, after all!&#x2019; was very often <supplied>[the]</supplied> finish of my brother [John] in summing up his censures of men&#x2014;so often that we had grown to expect it, and banter it&#x201D; (TC in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, I, 119). Alexander had described John&#x2019;s snoring in his last letter.</note> you would pity his cold and rejoice that he could sleep at all. In your next letterI shall expect a continuation of <pb id="pg-01-212" n="01:212"/>your journey,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A walking tour into Cumberland taken by Alick, John, and two friends.</note> with remarks upon the striking district which you surveyed, and the unpolished but honest-hearted mortals that inhabit it.</p>
<p>You will be glad to learn that I am well and comfortable. The landlady<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Duff of &#x201C;Duff&#x2019;s Lodging,&#x201D; 35 Bristo St. Mrs. Skene (or Skeens&#x2014;see <hi rend="italic">EL</hi>, p. 81) was his landlady at the Kirkwynd, Kirkcaldy.</note> I am with is a careful decent kind of woman, she seems to be the best I have had since Mrs Skene, whose like I do not look for. This trifling yet not unimp<supplied>[ortan]</supplied>t matter, is thus, I hope, fairly settled. I attend the law class, with some sat<supplied>[isfac]</supplied>tion, and read a book called Erskine&#x2019;s Institute upon the same. Erskine&#x2019;s institute, would weigh about four stones avoirdupois; and you would <supplied>[think]</supplied> the very Goddess of dullness<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Duncaid.</hi></note> had inspired every sentence. Yet I proceed without fainting. I go likewise occassionally to the Parliament-house; and hear the pleadings. I imagine it would not be difficult to demolish certain persons whom I see gain a livelihood by pleading there. In the mean time it behoves me to live in hope, and make every effort. There is nothing new here almost. Some timourous individuals about Glasgow, imagined that the Radicals (as their cant name is) intended to <hi rend="italic">rise</hi> on Monday last; and accordingly on Saturday all the soldiers were sent from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; Jock&#x2019;s lodge;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A hamlet, called after a mendicant, absorbed into the city&#x2019;s suburbs.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Nothing could give me greater pleasure than to learn that you continue in good health, and are improving even in that particular. I entreat you, for the sake of us all, to be careful of this invaluable privilege. It is the foundation of every earthly blessing. With it and a clear conscience, no human creature need in general be miserable.&#x2014; You will be satisfied to learn that I am very well. By taking a proper degree of exercise my bodily frame, I find, may be made to do its duty pretty well; and accordingly I make a point to divide the day between study and walking. It is the more necessary, as when I neglect it, the dark side of my affairs never fails to present itself to my solitary imagination, and I am as unfit for study as for flying&#x2014;upon the whole however, I go courageously along; and to beat the hoof half an hour before breakfast, and an hour before entering the law class at 2 or rather half-<supplied>[pa]</supplied>st one, is quite sufficient to keep me in good heart. The law I find to be a most complicated subject; yet I like it pretty well, and feel that I shall like it better as I proceed. Its great charm in my eyes, is that no mean compliances are requisite for prospering in it. I must struggle, and solace myself with the delightful hope that the day <hi rend="italic">will</hi> yet come, when I may shew you all what sense I entertain of your affectionate conduct.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-214" n="01:214"/>The cakes are excellent and most acceptable. I think, you must have left out one sock: at least I can find but three in the box. You need not take all this trouble on you, about these articles; I have plenty of socks. I know not whom to thank for the ham: doubtless it will do me good service&#x2014; I have not yet fairly arranged the newspaper, not having looked for the carrier so soon&#x2014; I shall tell you fully about it when he returns. Write to me very copiously, whenever you can find as much time. I trust, My dear Mother, we <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> yet agree in all things. But absolute sameness of opinion, upon any point, is not, as I have often said, to be looked for in this low erring world&#x2014; <closer><salute>Excuse my brevity; and Believe me to be,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>My dear Mother, / ever your&#x2019;s most affectionately, /</salute></closer>
<name>Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>My compliments to Margaret: she must write before the milking hour, another time. My father I trust is well tho&#x2019; you say nothing of him.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Your cold has, I trust, by this time entirely left you. From experience, I know it to be a vile distemper, and the parent of many others. You must take particular care of wet or even damp feet, as your throat, for a while, will be more than usually liable to such affections.</p>
<p>Your writing mends apace; and your progress in the Latin seems to be very rapid. At the end of your Rudiments you will find several pages of the new testament in latin; it is as good for reading as any thing you can get in the interim. About two or three weeks hence I expect you will be ready for Cornelius Nepos.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friend of Cicero who wrote <hi rend="italic">Vitae Excellentium Imperatorum</hi>.</note> There is a little copy of it, about the house which you may look for and try; but if you like, upon examining it, I shall send you a late edition of the work with notes and a little dictionary at the end. It is much easier to read in that shape: indeed if I had not been obliged, to write Jardine about a book of his in my possession, and to pack boxes &#x26;c in such a monstrous hurry, I would have gone over to David Brown&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An Edinburgh bookseller.</note> and got it for you this night. Persevere my lad, and <supplied>[when]</supplied> I return to Annandale <pb id="pg-01-215" n="01:215"/>let me find an expert latinist. I am glad you ha<supplied>[ve]</supplied> attacked Hume. Your remarks are just as far as I can determine. Egbert, Alfred &#x26; Harold were men of note in their own times. Alfred particularly must have been a great man: but he lived in a fabulous age. Do you remember Canute, and Leolf the robber who killed the King (Edmond?) at his own table? After the bastard of Normandy William the (<hi rend="italic">Conquisitor</hi>, acquirer, falsely called) conqueror, the narrative becomes more and more interesting.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle seems to be reflecting his reading of Millar&#x2019;s history of England.</note></p>
<p>I have scarce got time to try on the clothes yet. I suppose however, they will do well enough. What tempted the man to send radiated buttons. The waistcoat and gaiters can come next time.&#x2014; I send you Johnston&#x2019;s letter,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An extremely long letter from James Johnston, <date when="1819-09-18">18 Sept.</date>, written from Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, and describing his voyage across the Atlantic and his new life in Nova Scotia. He was caught in two big storms on the Atlantic, where he also saw a comet.</note> to read for the benefit of the house. You will send it back next time the Carrier comes: and you need not shew it to any one, except the Bogside people or any of his relations if they require it. Poor James! he has had a fearful passage to the new hemisphere. May he be happy in it, as his innocent, honest mind deserves! You may send the letter back when you have done with it. I have not yet written an answer; because the Halifax mail does not leave London till the first Wednesday of <date when="1820-01-00">January</date>.</p>
<p>I am in a great haste; so you must excuse brevity &#x26; blunders. <closer><salute>Believe me to be,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother&#x2014;</salute>
<p>&#x2026; I said I should stay in Edinburgh during the Christmas holidays; but happily my firmness in this determination was not put to the test. Our professor <hi rend="italic">gives no holidays</hi>; so, at the present festive season, we <pb id="pg-01-216" n="01:216"/>are labouring with our wonted assiduity in the complex study of Law. I have not yet gained much knowledge of it: but he (Mr. Hume)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Hume (<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), nephew of the philosopher and historian. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18191118-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1819-11-18">18 Nov.</date></ref></note> is very plain hitherto, and by the help of those monstrous tomes with which I am environed, there is little doubt that I may in time acquire competent information upon all the branches of this science. I have not been so diligent of late, on account of a paper I am writing&#x2014;which I have a design to offer for publication.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His second attempt at unsolicited publication. An account of his trial with it is given in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 233&#x2013;35: &#x201C;It was still some eight or ten years before any personal contact occurred between Jeffrey and me; nor did I ever tell him what a bitter passage, known to only one party, there had been between us. It was probably in <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date> &#x2026; that I had taken a most private resolution, and executed it in spite of physical and other misery, to try Jeffrey with an actual Contribution to the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>. The idea seemed great, and might be tried, though nearly desperate. I had got hold somewhere &#x2026; of a foolish enough, but new French Book, a mechanical <hi rend="italic">Theory of Gravitation</hi>, elaborately worked out by a late foolish M. Pictet (I think that was the name) in Geneva; this I carefully read, judged of, and elaborately dictated a candid account and condemnation of, or modestly firm contradiction of (my amanuensis a certain feeble, but inquiring quasi-disciple of mine, called George Dalgliesh of Annan, from whom I kept my ulterior purpose quite secret): well do I yet remember those dreary evenings in Bristo Street; oh, what ghastly passages, and dismal successive spasms of attempt, at &#x2018;Literary Enterprise&#x2019;. &#x2026; My <hi rend="italic">review of Pictet</hi> all fairly written out, in George Dalgliesh&#x2019;s good clerk hand, I penned some brief polite Note to the great Editor; and walked off with the small Parcel, one night [<date when="1820-01-24">24 Jan. 1820</date>], to his address in George Street;&#x2014; I very well remember leaving it with his valet there, and disappearing in the night with various thoughts and doubts! My hopes had never risen high, or in fact risen at all; but for a fortnight or so, they did not quite die out,&#x2014;and then it was in absolute <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>, no answer, no return of MS., absolutely no notice taken; which was a form of catastrophe more complete than even I had anticipated! There rose in my head a pungent little Note, which might be written to the great man, with neatly cutting considerations offered him from the small unknown ditto; but I wisely judged it was still more dignified to let the matter lie as it was, and take what I had got for my own benefit only. Nor did I ever mention it to almost anybody; least of all to Jeffrey, in subsequent changed times, when at any rate it was fallen extinct.&#x201D; All efforts to locate Pictet&#x2019;s (presumably Marc Auguste Pictet, <date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>) book have proved unsuccessful. See also Maxwell H. Goldberg, &#x201C;Carlyle, Pictet, and Jeffrey,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">MLQ</hi>, VII (<date when="1946-09-00">Sept. 1946</date>), 291&#x2013;96. (George Dalgliesh matriculated in arts at Edinburgh from <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date> to <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>, and took law classes in <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>. He did not graduate.)</note> No mortal is aware of it, so you need not mention the circumstance: but I can see well enough that to this point my chief efforts should be directed.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>If I were not one of the meekest men that have flourished since the time of Moses, certainly I should break forth in a torrent of wrath &#x26; vituperation against your laziness. In serious dulness, you should have written to me&#x2014; But let that pass; my lodging is changed, you see; and I hope in a few days to be convinced that you repent of your omission.</p>
<p>This is not a time&#x2014;when the Carrier is clamouring for his packet&#x2014;to tell you any thing about that eternal subject, &#x2018;my situation.&#x2019; It is nearly <foreign><hi rend="italic">in statu quo</hi></foreign>, any way. My health is not to be complained of; and tho&#x2019; I have no society&#x2014;at least none worth calling by that name; tho&#x2019; the Law is a complicated skein which I have made few happy efforts to unravel; yet in general, I set a stubborn front to the storm, and live in hope of better days. In wet weather indeed&#x2014;when the &#x2018;digestive apparatus&#x2019; refuses to perform its functions&#x2014;my world is sometimes black enough. Melancholy remembrances,</p>
<lg><l><pb id="pg-01-218" n="01:218"/>&#x2018;Shades of departed joys around me rise,</l>
<l>With many a face that smiles on me no more,</l>
<l>With many a voice that thrills of transport gave,</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Now</hi> silent as the grass that tufts their grave&#x2019;&#x2014;</l></lg>
<p>And dark anticipations of the coming time. Such are the fruits of solitude, and want of settled occupation. But this also is vanity.</p>
<p>I had a letter from poor Johnston. His voyage was perilous and every way uncomfortable; but at last he seems quietly settled in the pleasant city of Annapolis. The boys are very ignorant, he says, several of them stupid; but his patron &#x26; the rest seem to give him satisfaction. You should write to him&#x2014; Poor James! What is this world, but a huge caravansera&#x2014;where even the sacred joys of friendship appear for a little &#x26; suddenly vanish away?</p>
<p>Your pupil George John<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George John Craig Duncan.

A message which he delivered from Miss Patrickson<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> was so inaccurately reported by this landlady&#x2014;that without the risk of violating etiquette, I could venture to comply with her kind invitation. A courtier, like you, knows that etiquette is a holier code&#x2014;than the decalogue or any other. I regret this <hi rend="italic">contretem</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">p</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

<p>I know one intimate friend of mine (more intimate than you) upon whom, the operation of such alchemy is very devoutly to be wished.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I was very happy to learn, by the carrier&#x2019;s arrival, some hours ago, that you were all in a state of health &#x26; motion at the period of his departure. You will be satisfied, in your turn, to hear that I am still a-foot, not withstanding the late tremendous reign of frost, which seemed enough to destroy every symptom of animal or vegetable life. Of all the kinds of weather that in my lifetime have descended from the pitiless North, the tract which is just ended appears to have been the most appalling. What with ice &#x26; snow and biting breezes, Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> seemed to be the capital of Greenland rather than of Caledonia. But the thaw is come at last, and I have gone through the process of freezing, without <pb id="pg-01-222" n="01:222"/>any inconvenience, except a filthy snivelling cold, which I picked up last Saturday, and which I expect to lay down to-morrow or next day. It may last a week if it will, for it gives me very small uneasiness.</p>
<p>Your long letter gratified me not a little. You are by far too severe a critic of your own productions. The account of your journey to Cumberland, was replete with amusing notices. I can perfectly conceive the feelings excited by your situation at Workington, upon being refused admittance at Curwen&#x2019;s Arms.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An inn in Workington on Bridge St., formerly the residence of the Curwen family.</note> It is at such a time, that the dogged stubborn sentiment of obdured patience<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2026; arm the obdur'd breast / With stubborn patience as with triple steel.&#x201D; From <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 568. He quotes it accurately in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi>, p. 44.</note> (too nearly allied to ill-nature, in some other cases) is really valuable. One has often room to use it, in the business of life. You have now partly seen Cumberland; &#x26; tho&#x2019; at a time of disadvantage, your journey will not be altogether fruitless: the remembrance of Skiddaw &#x26; the wild mountains that have frowned, since the creation&#x2019;s dawn, beside him, is a pleasant subject for the mind to rest on; and even the sight of the rude but honest-hearted boors that inhabit those regions, and the comparison of their ways of thinking &#x26; acting with our own, is always attended with enjoyment, and might be with advantage.</p>
<p>I am truly glad to find that you persevere in Hume. The remarks you make upon the various characters of whom he treats, seem just, as far as I can remember. Nor can I blame your enthusiasm at the name of Wallace or him of Bannockburn.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert the Bruce.</note> Those heroes stood in the breach when their country was in peril; that Scotland is not as Ireland is perhaps owing in a great measure to their exertions.&#x2014; As you proceed in the narrative, the events will become more interesting; &#x26; you will have more occassion to be on your guard against Mr Hume&#x2019;s propensities to toryism. Next time you write, I shall expect to hear about Surrey &#x26; Wolsey, Elisabeth, Raleigh, Drake &#x26;c. Before concluding, I will again take the liberty to advise you to be very careful of your writing&#x2014; Your spelling is materially improved: a little farther care will make it quite perfect.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It never did become perfect but remains conspicuously bad in later letters.</note></p>
<p>Your fears about my health are very obliging; though quite unnecessary at the present. In fact I am generally in very fair health: and I do not study at all too severely&#x2014;indeed not diligently enough I fear. For some time back, I have been employed a part of each night <pb id="pg-01-223" n="01:223"/>in writing a paper for the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review. I at last gave it in last Monday&#x2014;in a letter to Francis Jeffrey Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Jeffrey (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), Scottish judge and critic, M.P. for Malton and, after <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, for Edinburgh; one of the founders of, and at this time editor of, the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>. Carlyle did not meet him until <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18191229-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1819-12-29">29 Dec. 1819</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;desiring him to send it back if it did not suit his purpose. I have yet got no answer! Indeed I should not be surprised if it were not accepted: it was written on a very dry subject; and I was not at the time in my happiest mood for writing well. But if (as is very likely) it be returned upon me, I shall not take it greatly to heart. We can try again upon a more promising theme. No mortal but you knows of it; so I shall not feel abashed, at the failure of an attempt which was honest in its nature, and will be unknown in its consequences&#x2014;to any except friends. I shall tell you the result next letter. You do well to read the Scotsman. You will find in it a considerable quantity of information, and by combining it with the Courier<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, founded in <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date> and until <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date> edited by the Rev. Henry Duncan (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), minister of Ruthwell at whose home Carlyle was a frequent visitor while teaching in Annan. Henry Duncan instituted in Ruthwell, in <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>, the world&#x2019;s first savings bank. He was also discoverer and preserver of the Ruthwell Cross, inscribed with Runic writing, and was led to conclude from observation of the tracks of a four-footed animal impressed upon sandstone near Dumfries, that now extinct animals lived in earlier geological periods. See G. J. C. Duncan, <hi rend="italic">Memoir of the Rev. Henry Duncan, D.D.</hi> (New York, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>).</note> (of the Manchester paper, I know little), you will be able to form some idea of the state of the Country, which at this time has an aspect particularly striking. In case I should forget to do it elsewhere, I must beg you to tell the <foreign>sutor</foreign> [cobbler], that I cannot get the Scotsman, till he send me an order in writing to that effect. I may have it next journey. <closer><salute>Believe me to be,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I have read over your letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> with great satisfaction; and I devote the short while, which yet remains before Geordie&#x2019;s departure, to scribble this half-sheet by way of reply to it. I ought in the first place to ask your pardon for misdirecting you about the latin book you were to <pb id="pg-01-224" n="01:224"/>read. The volume in question is not, I find, at Mainhill, but here: I shall send it down in the box, and if you can manage it&#x2014;well; if not, send me word, and I shall not fail to get you another edition of it, with notes and a glossary, which you will find quite intelligible.</p>
<p>You do well to proceed with the Latin: it can in no case be quite useless to you; it may eventually be of great service. The understanding of one&#x2019;s own tongue is at all times an important matter; and no way is so completely efficient for that purpose as the study of Latin, which it is mainly grounded on &#x26; derived from. But particularly attend to your penmanship; neglect, no night, to write a copy&#x2014;longer or shorter. I approve very much of your remarks upon David Hume. Sandy tells me that you and he are in the habit of attending chiefly to the manners, opinions &#x26; general features of the different periods, which you Read about. This is the true way of proceeding in the study of history. It is good, surely, because it is pleasing, to know about battles &#x26; sieges and such matters&#x2014;and these things ought carefully to be stored up in the mind; but a person who gathers <hi rend="italic">nothing more</hi> from the annals of a nation, is not much wiser than one who should treasure up the straw of a threshing-floor and leave the grain behind. You are right to attend to dates; do not neglect the geography of the countries. In a short while you will find some of your old friends whom you met with in Charles V.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably <hi rend="italic">The History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V</hi> (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>), by William Robertson.</note> I am very glad that Alick &#x26; you are going fairly to get thro&#x2019; Hume: it is a task which very few accomplish, notwithstanding its pleasantness &#x26; utility. No one without it can be said to understand the first principles of the laws, church-government or manners of his own country.</p>
<p>I was a good deal diverted by your account of the Radical conspiracy at Ecclefechan.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In these years highly exaggerated fears of the radicals caused amusement as well as alarm.</note> No doubt the 'Squire of Kirtletown<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Kirtle is a stream in Annan which gives its name to the area.</note> would experience considerable chagrin at the total failure of his well-meant efforts to support the constituted authorities. Such things happen everywhere in these suspicious &#x26; distracted times: but no plot has yet reached me of a more Ludicrous nature than the one which you relate.</p>
<p>There is nothing new here; at least nothing that penetrates my secluded abode. The common people are in great distress; tho&#x2019; for several reasons that distress is less severely felt here than in manufacturing districts. The substantial burghers and other idle loyalists of the place <pb id="pg-01-225" n="01:225"/>are trainin<supplied>[g]</supplied> themselves to the use of arms for the purpose of suppr<supplied>[es]</supplied>sing the imaginary revolts of the lower orders. When <supplied>[I see]</supplied> one of those heroic personages, with his buff-belts, his cartouche-box and weapons of war, obstructing the progress of his Majesty&#x2019;s subjects along the streets, I can scarce suppress a bitter smile at the selfishness, &#x26; stupidity of men. In fact &#x2018;steel pills,&#x2019; tho&#x2019; a very natural, are a very ineffectual remedy, for a decayed &#x2018;constitution.&#x2019;</p>
<p>There has been some mistake made about the letter which was to go to Ruthwell. Mitchell tells me it was charged 8&#xBD;d. 
<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1820-01-13">13 Jan.</date></note> You had better ask the bearer of it to Annan, how he managed the affair: most likely, he would give it in to the post-office, and <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> the man of authority that it came from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. However there no great matter&#x2014;only to know again. You must write at great length next time: send me all the news in any degree or even no degree interesting. Mind your reading&#x2014;that is an account of it for my inspection. <closer><salute>I am</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho' you have not favoured me with a line, this great while; yet as I have still a few minutes left, I take the opportunity thus afforded me of sending you some small account of my proceedings.</p>
<p>You will doubtless think me a very trustless person for taking no farther notice of the philanthropic gazette, which I promised to get for you. The truth is, the poor drivelling bookseller, about whom I spoke, hampered &#x26; hummed so piteously last time I broached the subject, that I took compassion on his indecision and left the subject at rest. I am very sorry that you should be disappointed in this matter: but after all, I do not think very highly of the gazette in question; and the Repository seems to be a better book in several respects.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Philanthropic Gazette</hi> (London, <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">27</date>) and <hi rend="italic">The Repository of Arts, Literature, Commerce, Manufactures, Fashion and Politics</hi> (London, <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-00-00">29</date>).</note> If you want any publication that I can procure do not fail to tell me, and it shall be forth-coming. <hi rend="italic">Anything</hi> that I can ever do to serve you must <pb id="pg-01-226" n="01:226"/>lie far behind what I have owed to you since the earliest days of my existence.</p>
<p>The cakes you sent came in good season, their predecessors having been concluded two or three days ago. I was also glad to see the butter; for the first excellent pot came to an end soon after Farish&#x2019;s [Farries&#x2019;?] last visit to this city. The stuff which they sell here under the name of butter has few titles, often, to that honourable epithet. The main ingredient is sea-salt; the rest a yellow sour-tasted substance, which whether it ever actually existed in the shape of milk, I cannot determine.&#x2014; I am likewise obliged by the pieces of meat: but tho&#x2019; I have sent home the meal-poke, its contents are not exhausted&#x2014;a portion of them yet remains, in some jar or other, for future consumption.</p>
<p>Having now discussed these small matters, I must proceed to make some enquiries about your actual situation. And first of health&#x2014;I entreat you, my dear Mother, to be careful of that greatest of blessings. Do not expose yourself on any account in this intemperate weather: you are not calculated to stand it. Indeed its effects are pernicious to any one; but much more to one in your situation. When you write, I expect to hear very minutely about every thing pertaining to you. Do you ever recollect our evening-meals, in the little room, during the last, to me unusual but not unhappy summer?</p>
<p>I have already told the <foreign><hi rend="italic">callants</hi></foreign> [youngsters] that I am in a good state of health; therefore I need not enlarge upon this point. My way of life is very simple. I see few acquaintances; those I might see are not without good qualities, but their conversation cannot benefit m<supplied>[e]</supplied> greatly: so I devote my time to reading&#x2014;all but two or three diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> portions of it which are daily spent in walking. Whether I shall succeed in this undertaking of law, must depend on several circumstances. Providence, as you have often told me, will regulate them. Meanwhile let no malignant person put you in fear about my future destiny. With health, which I hope to enjoy, and with a frugal disposition, which I am pretty sure of enjoying, there is no room to fear.&#x2014; You must write to me whenever you can find time. <closer><salute>Remember me to my Father and all the rest about home.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>I remain, / My dear Mother, / Your&#x2019;s most affectionately /</salute></closer>
<name>Tho<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>I have been scribbling with so bad a pen that you will scarcely be enabled to read the inclosed observations. I have (or rather it has) blotted several passages too&#x2014;but Jack will help you.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>After gulping down the Narcotic draught, about which the conclusion of Sandy&#x2019;s letter will give you information, I seize the good old goose-quill-stump once more, to thank you for your sensible &#x26; well-written half-sheet; concerning which I had only to regret that it was not a whole one, filled with the observations that you are daily getting more &#x26; more ability to express as well as make. I am not tired of your moralising; but pleased, on the contrary, to find that you reflect on those consolations, which the &#x2018;various turns of fate below&#x2019; are still requiring at our hands, and which after all that we can think reduce themselves to patience &#x26; contentment, the only remedy for evils great or small. In the main, I approve very highly of your remarks on Hume. The wars of York &#x26; Lancaster were bloody indeed, but by weakening the power of our Kings and overturning the great barons, they contributed in no small degree to increase the influence of the commons, &#x26; bestow upon England the form of government which has raised her name so high in the annals of nations. I am not surprised that you feel some interest for Mary of Scotland. She was beautiful it is true; but I fear she was at the same time dissolute, imperious, unprincipled. Her beauty was very good for Darnley and Bothwell: but to us poor ugly wights in these latter days it is of small importance. I have been thinking that after concluding Hume, you might like to see the history of Scotland carried down to the same period as that where he leaves off. Malcolm Laing has written an intelligent, hard-headed rough account of the time which elapsed from James first&#x2019;s accession to the English throne (where Robertson concludes) to the union.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A History of Scotland from the Union of the Crowns to the Union of the Kingdoms in the Reign of Queen Anne</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>), by Malcolm Laing (<date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>).</note> Most likely I can get it for you from the library. But perhaps you will like some relaxation after so stubborn a season of application: in which case I shall try to get you some poetry or light stuff of that nature. I never go near auctions; yet I must endeavour to pick up a small work or two for Alick &#x26; you. A creature called Geo: Dalgliesh<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18191229-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1819-12-29">29 Dec. 1819</date></ref>.</note> (carrier&#x2019;s son at Annan) would run through fire and water for me; because I sometimes condescend in my sovereign bounty to dictate for him a speech to be said or sung in a <pb id="pg-01-228" n="01:228"/>kind of society which he frequents. He will lie in wait at auction-rooms (or get [torn] to do it) for Cowper&#x2019;s or Gray&#x2019;s poems or some such thing: you might perhaps see by the last Scotsman that I had perused it before you; and from this fact you would infer that Smith&#x2019;s line was superfluous. In fact I got a letter from Geo: Johnston, some days ago, containing a line which did the business. Mr George on that occasion told me that you were following the Latin; and he spoke of your progress, in terms that would put your modesty to blush if I should repeat them. Continue your studies my boy: and if you feel enough of love for literature, if its sweets will reward you for the bitterness with which they must be gathered; it may happen not to lie without your reach. Should I succeed&#x2014;And should I fail, it will be pleasing to reflect that a brother is not involved in such calamities. In the meantime learn, with all your might, when you can find a moment&#x2019;s leisure. Your penmanship, I am glad to see, is immensely improved. It wants only practice to make it quite respectable. Do not let it want this.</p>
<p>I could wish to hear from my Father, about the crops and all matters of that sort. I understand, things are not so flourishing with the farmer as they were lately: but the circumstance is matter rather of regret than surprise, for all ranks and classes are afflicted more or less in these disastrous days. You must write to me, in a very circumstantial manner next opportunity; and in the mean time allow me to conclude, for time hastens, and Mag is yet to serve.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>One of the first objects which saluted my eyes this morning, on sallying forth to take the usual walk, was the welcome Figure of George Farries. But tho&#x2019; this diligent way-faring man,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Jer. 9:2.</note> promised to send my box to me without loss of time; and tho&#x2019; I did actually get it, on personal application&#x2019;s being repeated, about eleven o&#x2019;clock; yet so many small engagements have intervened, that twilight has arrived before I am able to commence my reply to your letter.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-229" n="01:229"/>Considering your circumstances,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick would be getting ready for spring planting and otherwise preparing for the new season.</note> it is easy to find a good enough excuse for your brevity. Lockerby market is no eligible place, as you remark, for encouraging bodily or mental vigour. Considering every thing I ought to be thankful that you wrote at all&#x2014;especially thankful that you were again able to communicate the grateful intelligence of our whole family&#x2019;s good health. For my own share, except a similar assurance about my outward man, I have nothing at all important to tell you. The days glide swiftly, too swiftly, away; and the returning breath of Spring reminds me that another year is subtracted from my allotted share; yet this consideration is hardly sufficient to arouse me into strenuous exertion; I am too apt to forget that opportunity, provided with a hairy brow, is bald behind.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;opportunity &#x2026; behind,&#x201D; see Cato&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Disticha de Moribus</hi>, II, 26.</note> If the right weather, however, were fairly set in, I shall be more diligent. Indeed I have not been altogether idle, tho&#x2019; my efforts have been directed to trifling objects. The Life of Montesquieu was delivered to Brewster Saturday gone-a-week; and one of the small engagements alluded to above, was the concluding of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu&#x2019;s life, which little Geo: Dalgliesh finished copying for me, about an hour ago. The two will occupy some five or six pages. I am also to write the life of Dr Moore, his son Sir John Moore, Nelson &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Having recently lost the services of the poet Thomas Campbell (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>), Dr. Brewster had offered Campbell&#x2019;s work of writing articles for the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</hi> to Carlyle. In spite of the &#x201C;frugal terms, &#x201D; he accepted it as his literary apprenticeship and as a means of support which would serve him
 until <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>. In <date when="1897-00-00">1897</date> S. R. Crockett collected and published in his <hi rend="italic">Montaigne and Other Essays Chiefly Biographical</hi> seventeen articles from the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia</hi> which he attributed to Carlyle. Besides those mentioned in this letter the collection contains &#x201C;Montaigne, &#x201D; &#x201C;Montfaucon,&#x201D; &#x201C;Montucla,&#x201D; &#x201C;Necker,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Netherlands,&#x201D; &#x201C;Newfoundland,&#x201D; &#x201C;Norfolk,&#x201D; &#x201C;Northamptonshire,&#x201D; &#x201C;Northumberland,&#x201D; &#x201C;Mungo Park,&#x201D; &#x201C;William Pitt, Earl of Chatham,&#x201D; and &#x201C;William Pitt, the Younger.&#x201D; In <date when="1909-00-00">1909</date> A. Carlyle in <hi rend="italic">LL</hi> (I, 268) credited Carlyle with an eighteenth, &#x201C;Pascal,&#x201D; on the basis of evidence in those letters. G. B. Tennyson in his &#x201C;Unnoted Encyclopaedia Articles by Carlyle,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">ELN</hi>, I (<date when="1963-12-00">Dec. 1963</date>), 108&#x2013;12, has set forth a convincing case for the attribution of two more, &#x201C;Persia&#x201D; and &#x201C;Quakers.&#x201D; Carlyle also translated Sismondi&#x2019;s forty-page article on &#x201C;Political Economy&#x201D; from the French for Brewster in a volume published in <date when="1824-12-00">Dec. 1824</date>. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200607-TC-MAL-01">TC to <sic>MA</sic><corr>MAL</corr>, <date when="1820-06-07">7 June 1820</date></ref>.</note> I do not get on very quickly in these operations; but this is like my apprenticeship as it were; in time I shall do it far more readily. So soon as I can seize upon anything fit to be employed with&#x2014;a book to translate or the like, which I am not altogether without hopes of doing&#x2014;I shall hie to Annandale, to inhale my native breezes once again. Last Summer&#x2019;s residence there did me a <pb id="pg-01-230" n="01:230"/>world of good: another summer so spent would entirely new-model me. If I come, I shall not fail to make proof of that <hi rend="italic">shallow-made, high-standing</hi> quadruped which you have purchased: its price &#x26; your description lead me to expect a beast far preferable to poor Duncan.</p>
<p>As you read the Scotsman and Courier newspapers, intelligence of that plot at London<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Cato Street Conspiracy. Newspapers reported the arrest of Arthur Thistlewood (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>) and his fellow conspirators who had planned to assassinate the cabinet when it met at a dinner party on <date when="1820-02-23">23 Feb.</date> Thistlewood and four others later were executed. On being sentenced, Thistlewood (like Carlyle) declared that his &#x201C;every feeling was for the welfare of my starving countrymen,&#x201D; but that he had resolved on assassination when &#x201C;their miseries were laughed at, and &#x2026; they &#x2026; were cut down.&#x201D;</note> cannot but have reached you. It is a horrid piece of business&#x2014;assassination has long been a stranger to the British soil: but whilst we deprecate such shocking attempts, some pity should be mingled with our abhorrence of the frantic conspirators. Well-founded complaints of poverty, one might almost say starvation, met with indifference or cold-blooded ridicule on the part of Government, very naturally exasperate the ignorant minds of the governed, and impel them to enterprises of a desperate nature. If the King &#x26; his ministers do not adopt a set of measures entirely different from those which they have followed hitherto; it is greatly to be dreaded that more formidable &#x26; better-concerted resistance will ensue&#x2014;or what is worse, that, Britain once the mistress of the ocean, and the renowned seat of arms &#x26; arts, will sink from her lofty elevation, her rude cliffs, no longer embellished by freedom, presenting only their native barrenness &#x26; insignificance. But I hope better of Old England yet. In the mean time, what constitutes <hi rend="italic">our</hi> wisest plan is to follow our private concerns as diligently as we may, without mingling in civil broils&#x2014;unless imperious necessity<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Horace&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi>, III, xxiv, 6.</note> call us so to do.</p>
<p>You are very just in supposing that the offer<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of &#xa3; 10.</note> (poor indeed, but the <supplied>[best the]</supplied> circumstances will permit) which I made you was quite serious and unfeigned. I know not whether any channel opens in which you might try your commercial skill; but if it do, I would certainly advise you to embrace the opportunity&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it were but to instruct you with regard to what, I suppose, will be your future occupation. <hi rend="italic">Command me</hi>, my boy, so far as the few pounds I have are able to extend: they will increase yet, I ween, by diligence and activity&#x2014; I cannot employ them better.&#x2014; <closer><salute>But lo! the end of my paper&#x2014; Excuse my dullness&#x2014;believe that I shall do better another time; &#x26; do not doubt <pb id="pg-01-231" n="01:231"/>that, I remain (My dear Brother) ever your&#x2019;s Most affectionately.&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mitchell,</salute>
<p>Ever since the month of <date when="1820-01-00">January</date> last, a train of ill health, with its usual depression, aggravated by other privations and calamities too tedious to particularize, have pressed heavily upon me. The victim of inquietude and despondency, I could not resolve to afflict you with my sorrows or my dulness; and tho&#x2019; conscience frequently accused me of neglect, three months, you see, have passed away before the simple duty of answering your letter is performed.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle exaggerates. Mitchell wrote <date when="1820-01-13">13 Jan.</date>, about <hi rend="italic">two</hi> months before.</note> Tho' the period of my silence has been long, the excuse which I have offered might apply still longer; but my friends are too few, and my opportunities of acquiring more too slender for allowing me to stand such hazards: I cannot afford to lose the pleasure of our intimacy; and lest desuetude may cool (I trust it will not extinguish) that feeling, I write altho&#x2019; it be &#x2018;in spite of nature &#x26; my stars.&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi>, I, i, 647&#x2013;48.</note></p>
<p>You would suspect me of a closeness, far enough from my disposition, if I did not attempt to trace you a sketch of the life which I have led for some time past. It must be a brief sketch for many reasons, however; and chiefly because it will contain no feature calculated to interest any one, even a second self. Zimmermann has written a book which he calls &#x2018;the pleasures of solitude&#x2019;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Georg von Zimmermann (<date when="1728-00-00">1728</date>&#x2013;<date when="1795-00-00">95</date>), Swiss doctor and author of <hi rend="italic">Von der Einsamkeit</hi> (<date when="1755-00-00">1755</date>), translated into English in <date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>.</note> I would not have you to believe him: solitude in truth has few pleasures, uninterrupted solitude is full of pain. But solitude, or company more distressing, is not the worst ingredient of this condition. The thought that one&#x2019;s best days are hurrying darkly and uselessly away is yet more grievous. It is vain to deny it, my friend, I am altogether an unprofitable creature. Timid yet not humble, weak yet enthusiastic, nature and education have rendered me entirely unfit to force my way among the thick-skinned inhabitants of this planet. Law, I fear, must be renounced: it is a shapeless mass of absurdity &#x26; chichane, and the ten years, which a barrister <pb id="pg-01-232" n="01:232"/>commonly spends in painful idleness before arriving at employment, is more than my physical or moral frame could endure. Teaching a school is but another word for sure and not very slow destruction: &#x26; as to compiling the wretched lives of Montesquieu, Montagu, Montaigne &#x26;c for Dr Brewster&#x2014;the remuneration will hardly sustain life. What then is to be done? This situation&#x2014; But I touch a string which generally yields a tedious sound to any but the operator. I know you are not indifferent to the matter; but I would not tire you with it. The fate of one man is a mighty small concern in the grand whole of this best of all possible worlds,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Voltaire, <hi rend="italic">Candide</hi>, chap. xxx.</note> let us quit the subject, with just one observation more, which I throw out for your benefit should you ever come to need such an advice. It is to keep the profession you have adopted, if it be at all tolerable. A young man who goes forth into the world to seek his fortune with those lofty ideas of honour and uprightness which a studious secluded life naturally begets, will in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred, if friends and other aids are wanting, fall into the sere the yellow leaf,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, V, iii.</note> and if he quit not his integrity, end a wretched tho&#x2019; happily a short career in misery and failure. Dissipation is infinitely worse: I thank Heaven I am not a poet, I shall avoid that sad alternative.</p>
<p>I was glad to learn that you had finished the perusal of Homer.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell had written on <date when="1820-01-13">13 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;On the <hi rend="italic">Penult</hi> of the year <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date> I reached the last line of the Iliad. To speak of the merits of the Maeonian Bard from <hi rend="italic">one</hi> perusal only may be deemed presumption&#x2014;yet I may be allowed to say that my Enjoyment fell far short of Expectation. I found, &#x26; I am ashamed to say it, little to please and much to offend&#x2014; The Morals of his Divinities are those of St Giles&#x2014;their language that of Billingsgate or Wapping&#x2014; His Nestors are garrulous beyond endurance&#x2014;the Valour of his Heroes little else than savage Cruelty&#x2014; Milton is more sublime, Byron more vigorous, Campbell more pathetic &#x26; Scotts Novels a thousand times more interesting&#x2014; We tolerate him not because he is a good Poet but because he wrote three thousand years ago.&#x201D;</note> Certainly the blind bard is little obliged by your opinion of him: I believe, however, Candour is, and that is better. If from the admiration felt by Causabon, Scaliger &#x26; Co, and still more by the crowds that blindly follow them, we could subtract that portion which originates in the as hollow admiration of others for the same object; and if farther all affectation could be banished; I fear a very inconsiderable item would remain. In fact Maeonides has had his day&#x2014;at least the better part of it; the noon was five and twenty centuries ago; the twilight (for he set in <date when="1453-00-00">1453</date>) may last for other five and twenty centuries&#x2014;but it too must terminate. Nothing that we know of can last forever. The very mountains are silently wasting away, and long before eternity is <pb id="pg-01-233" n="01:233"/>done, Mont Blanc might cease to be the pinnacle of Europe, and Chimborazo<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mountain 20,702 feet high in Ecuador.</note> lie under the Pacific. Philosophy and literature have a far shorter date. Error, in the first, succeeds to error as wave to wave. Plato obscured the fame of Pythagoras, Cudworth &#x26; Kant of Plato: the Stagirite<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aristotle, born in Stagira.</note> and his idle spawn have been swept away by Lord Bacon, himself to be swept away in his turn. Even in the narrow dominion of truth the continuance of renown is not more durable: each succeeding observer from a higher vantage-ground compresses the labours of his forerunner; and as the <foreign><hi rend="italic">principia</hi></foreign> of Newton is already swallowed up in the <hi rend="italic">m&#xE9;canique c&#xE9;leste</hi> of La Place, so likewise will it fare with this present Lord of the ascendant.&#x2014; Poetry they tell us escapes the general doom: but even without the aid of revolutions or deluges, it cannot always escape. The ideas about which it is conversant must differ in every different age and country. The Poetry of a Choctaw, I imagine, would turn chiefly on the pains of hunger, and the pleasures of catching bears or scalping Chicasaws. In like manner tho&#x2019; some of the affections which Homer delineates are coexistent with the race, yet in the progress of refinement (or change) his mode of delineating them will appear trivial or disgusting&#x2014;and the very twilight of his fame will have an end. Th<supplied>[us]</supplied> all things are dying, my friend,&#x2014;only ourselves die faster. Man! if I had &#xa3;200 a-year, a beautiful little house, in some laughing valley,&#x2014;three or four pure-spirited mortals who would love me &#x26; be loved again,&#x2014;together with a handsome library, and&#x2014;a great genius, I would investigate the hallucinations that connect themselves with such ideas&#x2014; At present I must revisit this nether sphere.</p>
<p>I think you are decidedly wrong in the affair of Johnston.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1820-01-13">13 Jan.</date> Mitchell had written: &#x201C;Johnstone has never written either to me or Mr Duncan&#x2014;a circumstance which our people I see are a little hurt at&#x2014; If he cared nothing for me it was but common politeness in him to Mr D. and let him know how he liked his Situation&#x2014; I certainly did not expect it of him. As he promised to write me before I wrote him I shall wait till he gives me that liberty however long it may be.&#x201D;</note> His silence most assuredly proceeds not from any thing like ingratitude to Mr Duncan or inattention to you: these qualities are strangers entirely to the mind of our emigrant; and it will be very hard, if barrenness of fancy and extreme difficulty in writing letters should deprive him of friends whom he respects, as I well know, so highly. Most probably you have received intelligence from him ere this time: but even tho&#x2019; you have not, I would venture to regret&#x2014;if I might do so with impunity&#x2014;that punctilios &#x26; the point of honour should obstruct a <pb id="pg-01-234" n="01:234"/>correspondence&#x2014;to which the wide Atlantic offers difficulties enough. I can give very wholesome advice, you perceive: unfortunately it is easier given than followed: James&#x2019;s letter<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Johnston&#x2019;s last letter to Carlyle was dated <date when="1819-09-18">18 Sept. 1819</date>.</note> of four sheets is yet unanswered! Twice have I begun&#x2014;and twice has indolence or low spirits consigned my ill-fated paper to the winds. I am a great sinner in this point.</p>
<p>Present my most respectful compliments to Mr Duncan; and say, if you like, that I have not forgotten his kind request to hear from me; but my inabality to communicate any importance to a subject so trifling as the one he proposed, has hitherto prevented me from attempting it.&#x2014; Tell Mrs Duncan (after making my respects) that her young student,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George John, referred to in the Mitchell-Carlyle correspondence several times, is Rev. Henry Duncan&#x2019;s son, George John Craig Duncan (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">68</date>). He attended the University of Glasgow, where he matriculated in <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>, but did not graduate. He became a minister and later joined the English Presbyterian Church.</note> whom I regret that I have not seen for a while, is becoming a very smart little gentleman. I have no doubt he is improving both in understanding &#x26; <foreign><hi rend="italic">s&#x26;ccedil;avoir faire</hi></foreign>.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle uses the old spelling here.</note>&#x2014; We hear a sort of report here that the Courier is to be sold very soon&#x2014; How is this?&#x2014; <closer><salute>I know not whether I shall see you in summer: most probably I shall leave this town&#x2014;if forever I need not greatly care: but whether or not, I need not add that, I remain,</salute></closer></p>

<p>Many thanks, My dear Alick, for your agre<supplied>[e]</supplied>able &#x26; entertaining letter. As usual I have little time to tell you how the kind and hearty spirit which it breathes affects me; or to delineate in return the main features of my own condition. Our (not winged) messenger consigned to me your packets, at a time when I was forced to visit the library; a lecture on &#x201C;the diligence of poinding&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Writ for impounding (a Scots legal phrase)&#x2014;in other words a lecture on Scots law.</note> succeeded; then a morsel of beef-steak,&#x2014;and after all these surprising achievements&#x2014;here I sit with <pb id="pg-01-235" n="01:235"/>a scrap of paper on my desk&#x2014;and a pen that must travel over it, and others like it, in the brief space of an hour and a half&#x2014;under hazard of missing the conveyance. Upon the whole, however, it is not perhaps any great matter that I must be brief: there is nothing passing in these parts of an interesting nature; and my own situation has undergone no material or immaterial alteration since I wrote last. When I have told you that I am actually in good health, and added (what indeed might safely be omitted) that I am delighted to hear that you are all so likewise,&#x2014;the most important part of my commission will be executed.</p>
<p>You and my other affectionate friends at Mainhill are very kind to press me so urgently to come home. I shall not forget this speedily. The word home is sweet to a Scottish ear: and I should be the most unthankful soul on earth, if I did not gratefully reflect, that among all my wants &#x26; disappointments, I have yet Parents &#x26; brethren left, with whom I can repose for a season&#x2014;and forget, in the midst of sincere affection, liberty &#x26; vernal breezes, the smoke &#x26; stir<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Comus</hi>, l. 5.</note> of this dull world&#x2014; Of late I have been meditating to come home; last summer was of very great importance to me, and had I some stated job of work to keep me in employment, and drive away &#x2018;the vultures of the mind&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Titus Andronicus</hi>, V, ii.</note>&#x2014;I could spend the approaching months among you with great advantage. I was happy at Mainhill, happier upon the whole than I have been in general since my boyhood; and tho&#x2019; we, degenerate posterity of Adam<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Robert Burton&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy</hi>, Pt.

Before writing I expected to have it in my power to give you some satisfactory account of the chance I have to get a translation or other business of the like stamp to manage in my rustication; and when the box arrived I was busy writing the lives of Sir J. Moore &#x26; his father Dr Moore, in order that upon presenting them to Brewster to-morrow I might make some inquiries as to this matter. What my success may be I shall be better able to tell you next opportunity; in the meantime I have some hope&#x2014;I anticipate <supplied>[plea]</supplied>sure if I succeed&#x2014;rising early&#x2014;evening &#x26; <hi rend="italic">cracks</hi> <supplied>[talks]</supplied>&#x2014;Duncan&#x2019;s worthier representation (I mean the steed <pb id="pg-01-236" n="01:236"/>Duncan) and many things more arise before the fancy: but if I should fail, as much doubt there is&#x2014;seeing &#x2018;the best concerted schemes of mice &#x26; men gang aft aglee&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns&#x2019;s &#x201C;To a Mouse.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;I shall not altogether droop. With health, I can turn me many ways&#x2014;and I hope completely to recover that blessing&#x2014; Dr Brewster tells me that for 15 years he was at death&#x2019;s door; &#x26; now in his 42<hi rend="italic">nd</hi>

After these lives above referred to, I have none to write but those of Necker and Admiral Nelson, which will not be needed for 6 months. A review for Brewster&#x2019;s philosophical journal of a German book on Magnetism,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s review, &#x201C;Remarks upon Professor Hansteen&#x2019;s Inquiries Concerning the Magnetism of the Earth,&#x201D; appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</hi>, III (<date when="1820-07-00">July 1820</date>), 124&#x2013;38; IV (<date when="1821-01-00">Jan. 1821</date>), 114&#x2013;24. Christopher Hansteen (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>) was a Norwegian astronomer, physicist, and professor of astronomy and applied mathematics at the University of Christiania. His book which Carlyle reviewed here was published in <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date> and translated into German by P. T.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>When, in requital for your large well-written sensible letter, you cast your eye upon this pitiful half-sheet of ash-coloured paper blackened, as it soon will be, by a vile squirting pen, that spits &#x26; scratches rather than writes the imaginations of a hurried brain,&#x2014;you will be <pb id="pg-01-237" n="01:237"/>ready to cry out: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Exod. 21:24.</note> a sheet for a sheet&#x2014;this is foul play.&#x2014; But upon considering every thing, particularly what I have said in Alick&#x2019;s letter, your astonishment will be moderated; perhaps it will receive an opposite direction and magnify the present exploit so hastily consummated.</p>
<p>I must begin with expressing my satisfaction from the perusal of your remarks on the reign of Charles I. They are well-worded upon the whole, judicious &#x26; comprehensive. I think it a good exercise for you to commit your thoughts upon such topics to writing: and I shall always be delighted to read observations of so praiseworthy a sort.&#x2014; I am sorry that you cannot get the remaining volumes.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Sutherland has again lent out 2 of the Vols of Hume so that our progress is again suspended&#x201D; (JAC to TC, <date when="1822-03-25">25 March</date>).</note> Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s reign is more interesting than any other&#x2014;in several respects&#x2014;you will find pleasure in reading it, which I doubt not you will make haste to do, when ever an opportunity occurs.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An interesting anticipation of Carlyle&#x2019;s book on Cromwell which he wrote from <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> to <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>.</note>&#x2014; With regard to Lawson,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Andrew Lawson (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), son of the Rev. George Lawson of Selkirk and minister at Ecclefechan (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1824-00-00">24</date>).</note> it was surely kind in him to offer so as you relate, and I believe his library contains several books useful for you; but tho&#x2019; I have been thinking upon that matter since reading your letter&#x2014;I cannot specify any. Perhaps he may have Cowper&#x2019;s poems, which you will not like so well now as at a future date; perhaps he may have Dr Johnson&#x2019;s works: my mother can ask when she goes down&#x2014;&#x26;, lest I forget, tell her to present my compliments to this Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> person, when she sees him, and to say that I grieve to confess the five shillings which he gave me to present to the missionary society are still in my pocket: the very memory of them had faded like a vain dream, till a few days ago. I shall certainly present them, if I do not see Mr. L. at the synod and give them to himself&#x2014;</p>
<p>When you write next, I want to hear very minutely about all the transactions in which you have any interest immediate or remote. And first I want you <supplied>[to]</supplied> tell me if you hear any news of James Johnston. Has he written lately from Annapolis? I have never answered his letter (sinner that I am!); but I hear some reports from Mitchell that he is talking of returning. Is this true? you must ask at his relations. And farther, I wish you to tell Mrs Dr Johnston that I have got her son George&#x2019;s letter, and shall certainly get the Infirmary ticket so soon as <pb id="pg-01-238" n="01:238"/>the money reaches me; as to Dr Murray<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Dr. Murray, who died in <date when="1820-07-00">July 1820</date>, taught pharmacy and science at the University of Edinburgh.</note>&#x2014;he does not lecture any more. You can tell her this, &#x26; say I am to leave Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Soon.</p>
<p>This is a very confused story my boy Jack; but it will exercise the ingenuity at least&#x2014;to discover the meaning, and comply with it.</p>
<p>I am glad you read French&#x2014; It is a valuable tongue&#x2014;do not forget it. I designed to have got you Scott&#x2019;s (Walter&#x2019;s) life of Dean Swift<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The works of Swift with notes and a life by Sir Walter Scott were published in nineteen volumes in <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>.</note> from the library; but it was not there. When at home we shall get books from Annan in abundance.</p>
<p><closer><salute>The porter is not come; and as I may thus have time to send a line or two to my Mother&#x2014;I must conclude for the present, with an assurance that,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho' in the matter of epistles you are greatly my debtor, I very gladly employ the few minutes, which yet remain before the porter comes, in complying with your request to hear from me.</p>
<p>It ought to be matter of incessant thankfulness on my part that you are all yet spared to me, and blessed with some measure of health to enjoy the happiness with which Providence mingles the cup of life. To you in particular, my dear Mother, I know that I can never be sufficiently grateful&#x2014;not only for the common kindness of a mother; but for the unceasing watchfulness with which you strove to instill virtuous principles into my young mind: and tho&#x2019; we are separated at the present, and may be still more widely separated, I hope the lessons which you taught will never be effaced from my memory.&#x2014; I cannot say how I have fallen into this train of thought&#x2014;but the days of childhood arise with so many pleasing recollections, &#x26; shine so brightly across the tempests &#x26; inquietude of succeeding times&#x2014;that I felt unable to resist the impulse.&#x2014; I must descend to more homely matter, <pb id="pg-01-239" n="01:239"/>however; for time presses, and I have much to say&#x2014;considering the little room there is to say it in.</p>
<p>You already know that I am pretty well as to health; and also that I design to visit you before many weeks elapse. I cannot say that my prospects have got much brighter since I left you; the aspect of the future is still as unsettled as it ever was: but some degree of patience is behind; and hope&#x2014;the charmer, that &#x2018;springs eternal in the human breast&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pope, <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi>, I, 95.</note> is yet here likewise. I am not of a humour to care very much for good or evil fortune, so far as concerns myself; the thought that my somewhat uncertain condition gives you uneasiness chiefly grieves me. Yet I would not have you to despair of your <foreign><hi rend="italic">ribe</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A long, thin person.</note> of a boy: he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> do something yet; he is a shy stingy<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The word had the meaning &#x201C;peevish and ill-tempered&#x201D; at this time in Scotland.</note> soul, and very likely has a higher notion of his parts than others have: but on the other hand he is not incapable of diligence, he is harmless &#x26; possesses the virtue of his country&#x2014;thrift;&#x2014;so that after all, things will yet be right in the end.</p>
<p>I have now great store of cakes, meal &#x26;c &#x26;c so that I think you need not send any box next time Farries travels northwards. By that period I shall be better enabled to say how long it is likely that I shall be here. If you can find time to write me on that occassion I shall be very happy; if not I shall impute your silence to want of leisure or some other satisfactory cause; and patiently delay our conference till my arrival at Mainhill.&#x2014; You used to accuse me of bad writing; and for this time, I daresay you are in the right; for I have written as fas<supplied>[t]</supplied> as John Gilpin of deathless memory gallopped to or from &#x2018;the Bell at Islington so gay.&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to the poem (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>) by William Cowper (<date when="1731-00-00">1731</date>&#x2013;<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>).</note> You must be sure to tell me yourself or bid the boys tell me, how my father&#x2019;s health continues.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I received your letter about noon, and being this day upon the <pb id="pg-01-240" n="01:240"/>fasting list (not from religious but medicinal motives), I have spirits to write but very imperfectly to you and not at all to my valued correspondent Jack, whose letter however I esteem very highly on many accounts. In truth my silence is of small importance any way: I am coming home soon, and if once I &#x2018;loose my tinkler jaw&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns&#x2019;s &#x201C;A Fragment: When Guilford Good Our Pilot Stood,&#x201D; st. 5.</note> among you, you shall get enough and to spare of it. This flitting plan is a most soul-tearing thing at best; and besides the unavoidable labour of packing goods and clearing scores, I have to strive with multiplied engagements relating to my summer&#x2019;s employment. When I wrote last, I knew not whether I should get any business at all to keep my hand in use; but it now appears that I am to write several articles for the Encyclopedia (what they are I do not know&#x2014;for I have just been putting down a pretty long list, which Dr B. is to examine &#x26; select from and report about, on friday morning); I have also two pretty long articles to translate<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s only published translation this year (the only one until <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date> and the only one he would be at work on until <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822-00-00">22</date>) was &#x201C;Outlines of Professor Mohs&#x2019;s New System of Crystallography and Mineralogy,&#x201D; published in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</hi>, III (<date when="1820-07-00">July 1820</date>), 154&#x2013;76; III (<date when="1820-10-00">Oct. 1820</date>), 317&#x2013;42; IV (<date when="1821-01-00">Jan. 1821</date>), 56&#x2013;57. The last instalment was &#x201C;to be concluded in our next number,&#x201D; but was not. Friedrich Mohs (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>) was a German mineralogist and, at this time, professor of mineralogy at the mining academy at Freiberg.</note> which is the easiest job; and lastly (which ought to have been <hi rend="italic">first</hi>) I have to write a kind of review of that clear-backed large book which you will see in the box&#x2014;upon magnetism and other points: I ought to have done it here you know; but I felt my poor head so embarrassed &#x26; confused with one thing and another that it seemed upon the whole an easier plan to take the concern home with me, and prepare it at my ease&#x2014;what ease at least I can find before the middle of <date when="1820-05-00">May</date> when it will be needed. I have likewise some (slender) hopes of getting a French book to translate&#x2014;the life of Madame de St&#xE4;el;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mme. Necker de Saussure, <hi rend="italic">Notice sur le caract&#xE8;re et les &#xE9;crits de Mme de Sta&#xEB;l</hi> (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>). Anne Louise Germaine Necker, Baronne de Sta&#xEB;l-Holstein (<date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>), was the French novelist and miscellaneous writer whose <hi rend="italic">De l'Allemagne</hi> (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>) first attracted Carlyle to German thought.</note> but of this I am far from certain, having only Dr Brewster for my <foreign>haunch-man</foreign> [henchman] on this occassion and he having no personal interest in the affair. But whether his application, which he was to make this day to one Tate<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Tait (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), to become publisher and from <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> to <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> editor of <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi>.</note> a bookseller, be successful or not, I shall have plenty to do for one half-year: and tho&#x2019; the money resulting from <pb id="pg-01-241" n="01:241"/>such labour is not at all abundant, it is considerably better than the rewards of laziness. It will serve at least to keep the <hi rend="italic">Evil one</hi> out of one&#x2019;s pocket.</p>
<p>Now you will naturally be rather impatient after all this preamble, to know <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I am actually to be at Mainhill. In brief then, my project is this. I have promised to go &#x26; see Irving at Glasgow before my return; I design to leave this smoky &#x26; most dusty town upon Saturday first&#x2014;the same night &#x26; next day I shall likely spend with Nicol at Airdrie, and on Monday I shall be with Ned.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving.</note> How long I shall stay there is not so certain: it will depend upon the state of the city, of Irvings engagements &#x26;c. Upon the whole however it seems likely that if all go well, I shall see you about saturday (29th) or very soon after. It may be before: but you are not to weary if it should be Tuesday or Wednesday, tho I think <hi rend="italic">that</hi> unlikely. I trust I shall find you all in good trim.</p>
<p>There is scarcely room left on this scanty paper to tell you how little danger there is of your intellectual abilities <supplied>[not]</supplied> improving very rapidly and effectually. Your letters are already out of sight better than they were a twelvemonth ago; perseverance <hi rend="italic">will &#x26; must</hi> perfect them. Much has been said of genius; but it seems to me to consist in nothing so much as in the stubborn desire of improvement and progress. Wish to improve, and you will improve.</p>

<salute>My dear Johnstone,</salute>
<p>It is vain to apologize or dissemble. I am one of the most careless, negligent, ungrateful dogs in existence. I ought without doubt to have answered your long-looked-for and most valuable letter, by the very first opportunity. To have intended it, and gone directly to the post office for information about the Nova Scotia mails, is nothing: this long silence&#x2014;the longest that has occurred in our correspondence, since we first had the happiness to know each other&#x2014;gives you just ground to suspect that the lapse of a few months can obliterate all traces of a long friendship from my mind, and render the duties of that honourable relation an empty name. I confess you have just grounds for such thoughts: and I despair of gaining credit when I assure you that in entertaining them you would do me any thing but justice. Yet the fact is, I have not at any time forgotten you. Strolling about these moors, last summer, the sight of Bogside,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The home of the Johnston family near Mainhill.</note> of the sun setting in the <hi rend="italic">west</hi>, and twenty other objects incessantly and painfully recalled you to my memory: and in Edinburgh the presence of silly students with whom I could have <hi rend="italic">no</hi> sympathy or fellowship recalled you still more painfully. Why then did I not write? I know not; I have said that there is no apology of a satisfactory kind, and I shall not attempt to offer you a frivolous one: but something like a palliation for my conduct may be found in the successive fits of activity and low-spirits which occupied my time last winter, in the paucity of our opportunities to send letters to America, above all in the desultory procrastinating habits which a fluctuating being like me is sure to contract, and which <pb id="pg-01-243" n="01:243"/>steal away our minutes, we know not how, till they amount to months or years of time gone uselessly and irrecoverably by. It seemed so easy when I had missed the <date when="1820-01-00">January</date> mail (a few days after your letter reached me) to be in readiness against the first Wednesday of <date when="1820-02-00">February</date>; and when <date when="1820-02-00">Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date> &#x26; <date when="1820-03-00">March</date> had both passed fruitlessly away the thing became so painful to think upon, and Hill&#x2019;s projected voyage to New Brunswick offered such a flattering unction to my soul<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, iv.</note> that at last I gladly resolved to postpone the operation till his departure, which has been delayed several weeks longer than was expected. I ought to say also that I tried twice to write to you: but the demons of dulness and disquietude shed their poppies and their gall upon me; twice I attempted &#x26; <foreign><hi rend="italic">bis patriae cecidere manus</hi></foreign> [twice the father&#x2019;s hands dropped down (Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, VI, 33)]. Upon the whole, I see well enough that I have made out but a very lame case for myself; therefore after all that I can say my only resource is to throw myself on the mercy of the judge, and to entreat him to hope that I shall never in future behave so badly. If bulk can supply other deficiencies, you shall be satisfied: for I design to scribble nearly all the paper in the house.</p>
<p>I was going to congratulate you on the safe termination of the voyage desc<supplied>[r]</supplied>ibed so vividly in your letter, and to express my hope that time had already moulded your way of thinking and living into some degree of toleration for that of Annapolis; when I learned that your new situation appeared likely to yield nothing but discomfort and chagrin; that your
boys are stupid, your society brutish, your climate disagre<supplied>[e]</supplied>able and every thing about the place repulsive and disheartening. Alas! my dear friend, I am grieved to the heart for it. That by crossing the ocean you have not escaped from care, is not surprising&#x2014;she climbs the deck along with us; she follows us to the throne and the temple; the grave alone is delivered from her visits: but that after so much exertion danger and vexation you should still find so little to sweeten
the cup of life, is an affliction that I did not anticipate. Yet what can I say to comfort you? My words cannot transform Acadia into Tempe, its rude Planters into Roscoes, or its Trulliber<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parson Trulliber in <hi rend="italic">Joseph Andrews</hi>.</note> into what a clergyman ought to be. Not am I at all prepared, even if I were qualified, to advise you at such a juncture&#x2014;the circumstances have found me at second hand; I have been but two days at Mainhill, and I have yet seen none of your letters or correspondents. At first view <pb id="pg-01-244" n="01:244"/>however it certainly strikes me that America has presented its worst side first to you<supplied>[.]</supplied> A new situation commonly resembles a new suit of clothes: rarely does it fail to gall the wearer in some points at the beginning; yet a little while is generally sufficient to put all to rights, to make the robe accommodate itself to the man or the man to the robe.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This analogy is particularly interesting in the light of the philosophy of clothes evolved some years later in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>.</note> So may it fare with your tutorship at Annapolis. I can easily conceive, for I have often felt, the forlorn sensation that takes possession of the mind, when no object is at hand to interest it, and no other mind to communicate with: I can understand the painfulness of teaching, the trouble of interrupted habits, and twenty other inconveniences that your place abounds with: yet still before determining (as I hear you have well nigh done) to revisit Europe, I would have you steadily reflect upon the consequence of such a step. Can you determine to become a schoolmaster finally, to perambulate the country as a dissenting preacher, or to spend some dozen painful years in the family of a paltry squire with the hope of gaining an obscure footing in the establishment?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The established Church of Scotland.</note> None of these plans I think would suit you well; yet they are almost the only avenues which the literary profession holds out for preferment to persons in our station. Even these poor avenues are in this country overcrowded, one is jostled in them at every step: other lines of life are not less overcrowded; and in place of times mending, it seems clear to most unprejudiced people that the distress, not to say starvation, which at present involves the trading part of the community, must ultimately and that ere long involve all the lower classes entirely&#x2014; Nothing then to be hoped but the dubious and distant result of revolution and civil discord. This is a pale and dreary prospect, my friend, which Great Britain holds out to one; I fear, however, it is too faithful. On the other hand consider how many of the evils that now torment you custom will inure you to endure with indifference, perhaps with satisfaction&#x2014;consider the pleasure of an independent maintenance&#x2014;consider the boundless field which the new country opens for exertion of every sort&#x2014;a field not impoverished like ours and disputed in daily strife; but thinly occupied and fertile tho&#x2019; coarse. Consider all this, I intreat you, before adopting a resolution, which must now be final&#x2014; Fortune and the world conspire to chastise us severely for inconstancy; and at our time of life it is highly disadvantageous to change.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-245" n="01:245"/>In all this long discussion, I have endeavoured to speak the cold and naked truth, as it appears to my own mind, on considering every circumstance that has come to my knowledge on the subject. I have endeavoured to divest myself of every partial or selfish feeling; because I consider that your demeanour on this occassion may give a colour to the rest of your life; and whoever takes upon him to advise a friend ought to speak with an eye to that friend&#x2019;s interest alone. It has cost me an effort so to do in this case: few persons I suppose have missed you more than I; and should you upon maturely contemplating both sides of the question, determine to return to Scotland, I shall be the very first to welcome you with heart &#x26; hand to your native shore. Perhaps you have views, which I know not of; perhaps your agricultural skill might be exercised in England more advantageously than any of your other acquirements; I shall be most happy to find it so: but I would not advise you to lay any stress upon the pleasure of spending another winter in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; unless you have distinct prospects of putting the knowledge you will acquire there to use, I would not advise you to go even tho&#x2019; you were in Scotland and doing nothing. Edinburgh looks beautiful in the imagination, because the heart, when we knew it of old, was as yet unwrung and ready to derive enjoyment from whatever came before it. Visit the <hi rend="italic">alma mater</hi> now, and you are disgusted probably with the most feeble drivelling of the students&#x2014;shocked at the unphilosophic spirit of the professors&#x2014;dissatisfied with the smoke and the odour and every thing else in or about the city. I certainly would not counsel you to make any sacrifices for what I know from sad experience would almost without doubt disappoint you: yet this I think ought hardly to weigh at all in forming your determination. Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> may have changed since we knew it&#x2014;we ourselves may have changed still more&#x2014;yet after all, there is a world, even in Scotland, there is a world elsewhere.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>, III, iii.</note> I repeat my request (and with it conclude this prolix dissertation) that you would stedfastly and seriously consider the circumstances of the case&#x2014;do nothing rashly&#x2014;and if you resolve to return back to Annandale, be sure that all your friends, and they are not few, will experience the greatest satisfaction at beholding you once more.</p>
 <p>After perusing the preceding pages, gratuitously consecrated to advise upon a subject which I know so imperfectly, you will be ready to infer that myself am placed on some commanding eminence, above the vicissitudes of Fortune, &#x26; qualified to cast down an experienced <pb id="pg-01-246" n="01:246"/>eye upon the vortex of human affairs. You were never in your life more mistaken. At no period, that I recollect, have matters had a more doubtful aspect. I went to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in winter, after a summer pleasantly but not very profitably spent at my Father&#x2019;s, with the view of studying Scots law&#x2014;intending, as you know, if all things prospered to make one desperate effort at obtaining an Advocates gown; and gaining my bread by a profession recommended to my fancy so strongly, by the honourable nature of the exertions that insure success in it. I went in moderate health; and with considerable hopes: but alas! David Hume owns no spark of his uncle&#x2019;s genius; his lectures on law are (still excepting Erskine&#x2019;s Institute) the dullest piece of stuff I ever saw or heard of. Long-winded, dry details about points not of the slightest importance to any but an attorney or notary public; observations upon the formalities of customs which ought to be instantly &#x26; forever abolished; uncounted cases of blockhead A versus blockhead B, with what Stair thought upon them, what Bankton, what the poor <hi rend="italic">doubting</hi> Dirleton;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to Sir James Dalrymple, First Viscount Stair (<date when="1619-00-00">1619</date>&#x2013;<date when="1695-00-00">95</date><corr>; <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7050"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref></corr>), who wrote <hi rend="italic">The Institutions of the Law of Scotland</hi> (<date when="1681-00-00">1681</date>); Andrew MacDowall, Lord Bankton (<date when="1685-00-00">1685</date>&#x2013;<date when="1760-00-00">1760</date><corr>; <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17471"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref></corr>), Scottish jurist who wrote <hi rend="italic">An Institute of the Laws of Scotland in Civil Rights</hi>, 3 vols.

By degrees I got disheartened; the <hi rend="italic">science</hi> of law seemed little calculated to yield a reward proportionate to the labour of acquiring it; I became remiss in my efforts to follow our lecturer thro&#x2019; thro&#x2019; [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] the vast and thorny desart he was traversing; till at length I abandoned him altogether&#x2014;with a resolution that if ever I became familiar with law, it must be under different guidance. Occassionally too I tried writing, but most of my projects in that department altogether failed. The silly lives of Montesquieu, Monta<supplied>[i]</supplied>gne &#x26;c &#x26;c which I wrote for Brewsters Encyclopedia are not worth mentioning; the rest are yet in embryo. At length these incidents aided powerfully by the last horrible winter, began to act upon my health: I determined to quit Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and on Wednesday evening I returned once more to Mainhill&#x2014;wearied and faint, and tho&#x2019; long used not altogether reconciled to the rest which is enjoyed upon the pillow of uncertainty.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18180626-TC-JJ-01">TC to JJ, <date when="1818-06-26">26 June 1818</date></ref>.</note> I am to translate &#x26; write some trifles during summer if my spirits serve; what next&#x2014;I am sorry that I care so much more than I know. Upon the whole I am altering very fast. Hope will not always stay with one; and despair is not an eligible neighbour. I do not think I <pb id="pg-01-247" n="01:247"/>am ever to have any settled way of doing. Teaching &#x26; preaching I have forsworn; and I believe I am too old for beginning any new profession. One leads a strange miscellaneous life at that rate: yet if it cannot be helped&#x2014;</p>
<p>It must be owned however that I have no great reason to complain. On looking at the condition of many others there seems rather cause for gratulation. Never in the history of Britain did I read of such a situation as the present&#x2014; Black inquietude, misery physical &#x26; moral, from one end of the island to the other, radical risings, and armed confederations of the higher classes, and little or no expectation of better times. This neighbourhood, I find, is suffering very slightly in comparison; on my way from Paisley I passed several groups journeying hither in search of work &#x26; food, like the Isrealites of old to Goshen in the dearth:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 47.</note> yet none can doubt that the Agriculture <hi rend="italic">must</hi> feel the pressure of those taxes which at present exclude our commerce-except at a ruinous rate&#x2014;from almost all the markets of the world. I am not a croaker; but I forecast nothing except an increase of calamity for several years to come. I suppose you have heard fully from the newspapers of the radical commotions, the marching, countermarching, armaments and battles that have marked this troubled winter. The disturbances are quitted for a season; but as an old peasant, whom I overtook on the road from Muirkirk, expressed himself, unless these times alter, folks will all be radicals together. One of the events which have occurred in the late troubles may affect you more than many other events of greater importance. I allude to the capture of William Smith shoemaker Ecclefechan, who had travelled to Glasgow for the purpose of buying leather; and falling in with sundry men of kindred sentiments had farther invested himself with the character of <hi rend="italic">delegate</hi> from our poor unpolitical village, and proceeded to act forthwith in that capacity. His dignity soon withered from his brow; and scarcely had he got his sentiments disclosed, when the room in the Gallowgate which those statesmen occupied was environed by a party of soldiers, and the whole fraternity of reformers with poor Will among them were lodged in Glasgow jail. Poor Sutor! I know not the extent of his criminality: but from the complexion of the times, I should not be at all surprised if he were sent to botanize in New Holland.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No report of Smith&#x2019;s arrest and trial has been traced, but reports in the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> show that a general strike was called in Glasgow and surrounding districts early in <date when="1820-04-00">April</date>; many ceased working; disturbances were feared; and arrests were reported in Glasgow on <date when="1820-04-05">5 April</date>. The provost and magistrates made proclamation that to strike work would expose &#x201C;participators &#x2026; to the certain punishment of High Treason.&#x201D; Trials for treason are reported to have been held in <date when="1820-07-00">July</date>, in Stirling, Glasgow, Paisley, Dumbarton, and Ayr.</note>&#x2014; I have much to say on the present state of public <pb id="pg-01-248" n="01:248"/>affairs; and if you were beside me, you would have to hear it all: but it is a little too much to occupy our brief interview with such matters&#x2014;now that you are beyond the ocean and not at all concerned by them, and that I tho&#x2019; on this side the great water, am so situated as to have nothing to hope and almost nothing to fear from any political change whatever. I consign you therefore if desirous of additional information, to two well-written articles by Jeffrey in the last Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> reviews&#x2014;and if you honour the maxim, <foreign><hi rend="italic">audi alteram partem</hi></foreign> [hear the other side], to sundry delirious speculations from the pen of Mr Southey, wherein these points are handled at considerable length in the Quarterly review.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, LXV (<date when="1820-01-00">Jan. 1820</date>), probably arts. ix and x, both of which are on works pertaining to manufacturing conditions. <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>, XXIII (<date when="1820-01-00">Jan. 1820</date>), in which art. x is on exactly the same topics as art. x in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>; also art. iv in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>, XXIII, which is on radical reform.</note> I betake me to private history, in which tho&#x2019; with equal dulness and haste, I am sure of exciting deeper interest. I know not when or what you have heard from Scotland&#x2014;and possibly my intelligence may be but like a twice-told tale; yet at the risk of tiring you, I propose to venture upon some details&#x2014;the most prominent of the few that have reached me.</p>
<p>I can afford but the most prominent; for if I should mention more than the names of those neighbours even who have departed from this fitful scene, the greater part of my sheet would be occupied with the obituary. As none of these persons, however, are connected with you more closely than by the ties of common acquaintance, I shall insert only my father&#x2019;s last surviving brother, who finished his earthly existence a few months after your voyage to Annapolis. With what feelings I saw my Uncle Francis (connected so intimately with my earliest and most pleasing recollections) consigned to the narrow house it is needless to describe. After life&#x2019;s changeful fever he sleeps well:<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, III, ii.</note> and many of the living have cause to envy such repose.</p>
<p>Your friends at Hitchill I have not seen for 6 months; but believe them to be well. They leave Annandale at the expiration of the lease. During my few visits in summer, your name of course formed a leading theme: you should write to them if you are not on the very wing <pb id="pg-01-249" n="01:249"/>for home. Poor Owen answered very ill; he was paid off in the course of a few months; James Church was transported to Saul&#x2019;s boarding-school at Greenrow&#x2014;John consigned to Miss Harper, and Duncan sent to Clarencefield. They are not boys of the first water.</p>
<p>With regard to Mr &#x26; Mrs Duncan, Mitchell and the rest of them at Ruthwell, I know little except thro&#x2019; the medium of little George John<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George John Duncan.</note> whom I saw five weeks ago in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> letter from our friend Mitchell, which has formed my allowance during winter. I suppose they too are all in prosperity. Mr Duncan&#x2019;s loss of the plea with Colin Monro appears to be the most important occur<supplied>[r]</supplied>ence in his history since your departure. I must not neglect to inform you while on this subject, that Mitchell expresses the most profound astonishment not unmixed with irritation at your neglect to write him or, at any rate, Mr Duncan. You should have written; and tho&#x2019; I did any thing but foment M&#x2019;s disappointment, I do entreat you to send them all letters home by the return of Hill&#x2019;s ship. For myself tho&#x2019; I am dying with desire (as the French say) to hear from you, I shall generously surrender three fourths of my share rather than such a duty should be neglected. No matter how short&#x2014;be sure to write them each a letter.</p>
<p>And now, my friend, I must draw this wretched tissue to a close. My paper is coarse, my mind has been distracted and hurried by a thousand cross accidents since I began to write: I have written stupid<supplied>[ly]</supplied> and tediously of course; nothing has been as it should be but the wish to please you, which I do most conscientiously pretend to. I am persuade<supplied>[d]</supplied> y<supplied>[ou wi]</supplied>ll pardon my inconsistencies and blunders for the sake of this last <supplied>[in]</supplied> stance; nay farther that in spite of all my faults you will write m<supplied>[e at]</supplied> immense length by the ship&#x2019;s return. I have said that it would not surprise me if you returned on board of her; it will hardly please any one so highly as myself: yet if so be not, if we must not see each other for many long eventful years, I hope both of us will always retain a happy &#x26; heartfelt remembrance of the many days we have spent together; and neglect no opportunity of cultivating an intercourse so pleasant, by every means that yet remains to us<supplied>[.]</supplied> My Mother sends her most kind respects to you, and best wishes for your&#x2014;safe return&#x2014;so she phrases it; my father is presented <supplied>[prevented]</supplied> by absence from joining at the present moment from joining in this wish; but Alick and Mag who are beside me&#x2014;&#x26; every other heart about Mainhill&#x2014;desire to be most cordially included <pb id="pg-01-250" n="01:250"/>in it. Bogside I suppose has written a letter by this conveyance&#x2014;so I have not mentioned any domestic news. Edward Irving is at Glasgow, Dr Chalmers&#x2019; assistant; I spent a-week with him on my return from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014; He succeeds wonderfully. But I have room for nothing more. <closer><salute>Write to me as fully as you possibly can; unless you intend to bring <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>; and believe me to be with the warmest wishes for your prosperity,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept the sincere expression of my gratitude for your kind letter which, after many wanderings to and fro, found me yesterday morning here at my Father&#x2019;s, on the skirts of Dumfriesshire. I left Edinburgh about the <date when="1820-04-20">twentieth of April</date>, spent ten days with Mr Irving about Glasgow, and arrived in these parts some two weeks ago. Since my return to Annandale, I have chiefly been occupied with strolling <pb id="pg-01-251" n="01:251"/>about the fields, revolving most dreamy thoughts&#x2014;which the fardarting and impetuous character of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, delineated in Go&#xEB;the&#x2019;s play of that name, did not by any means tend to express; I have also been engaged in writing a very pitiful critique on a german work about the magnetism of the Earth, which you may possibly see in the next number of that pamphlet, honoured with the name of <hi rend="italic">philosophical</hi> journal, and conducted by Brewster &#x26; Jameson.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190329-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1819-03-29">29 March</date></ref>.</note> Glad to have escaped the cumbrous task, I proposed to spend this day in visiting and recreation&#x2014;for the magnetism was despatched yesterday: but the contents of your letter are such as to call for an answer immediately, and my departure is postponed two hour<supplied>[s]</supplied> accordingly.</p>
<p>I have not seen Mr Gallaway<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Galloway (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), a mathematician.</note> for a month, and I am not in the habit of corresponding with him. Perhaps therefore he may already have engaged with Mr Vicars, and the trouble I am now giving you may prove entirely superfluous. I would not for any considerations interfere with Mr Gallaway&#x2019;s views in such a case: but if he has altogether renounced the situation, I shall beg of you to give me some more definite and circumstantial information about the duties and emoluments connected with it; so that if it really seem of sufficient promise, I may forthwith endeavour to &#x2018;raise the waters,&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Merchant of Venice</hi>, II, ii.</note> as Launcelot has it,&#x2014;in other words, to procure all manner of recommendatory letters from Leslie and the rest who inhabit the Olympus of Science, and condescend to ray out some beams of their glory now and then upon certain of such as inhabit the base of the mountain. Eighty pounds a year, if board and lodging are included, is a respectable salary for teaching a mathematical class three hours a-day; and if the lecturing yield an additional emolument in proportion to its difficulty, one might contrive to do very well on such terms, particularly with so estimable a person as you represent Mr Vicars to be. It is true! I hate teaching (this will be a dash of ink among the carmine which you have generously lavished on me) in all its branches; yet what can a solitary person do? The inhabitant of Bridewell hates beating hemp; but he hates flogging still worse. If however, Mr Vicars wants a creature of the <hi rend="italic">usher</hi> species, to sit ten or a dozen hours per diem with his boarders, to superintend the washing of their faces, and see them all quietly put to bed each evening&#x2014;I cannot be of any service. The <pb id="pg-01-252" n="01:252"/>very word usher vibrates detestably across the tympanum of one&#x2019;s ear. Do you remember poor Oliver Goldsmith?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goldsmith went through a painful ordeal as an usher in Dr. Milner&#x2019;s &#x201C;classical academy&#x201D; at Peckham in <date when="1756-00-00">1756</date>.</note></p>
<p>I might be happy enough here, if the Enemy would let me. The rustic accom<supplied>[m]</supplied>odation of a Scottish farm is amply compensated by the cordial welcome that accompanies it; tho&#x2019; destitute of philosophers we have four or five intelligent men at no great distance; I could even be delighted with guiding the younger minds of two brothers thro&#x2019; the pages of Hume and Le Sage. Then there are &#x2018;Persia&#x2019;, &#x2018;Quake<supplied>[r]</supplied>s&#x2019; &#x26;c &#x26;c to write for Brewster, thro&#x2019; the summer. But after all, one longs for a broader and more brilliant theatre. York is to me like a city of the mind. In my dreams, I have heard the &#x2018;Humber loud that bears the Scythian name,&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Or Humber loud that keeps the Scythian&#x2019;s Name&#x201D; (Milton, &#x201C;At a Vacation Exercise in the College,&#x201D; l. 99).</note> and seen the field of Marston moor with the <hi rend="italic">iron bands</hi> of Cromwell, when the genius of England awoke, des<supplied>[cending?]</supplied> like reapers to the harvest of death.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marston Moor, between York and Harrogate, was the site of a victory by Cromwell in <date when="1644-00-00">1644</date>.</note> I should like to see <supplied>[Yorkshire?]</supplied> with the eye of flesh; I would willingly speak with your countrymen, all of whom I (falsely) conceive to be <hi rend="italic">Allens</hi> or <hi rend="italic">little Allens</hi>; in short, twenty other longings would be gratified by a respectable establishment in your city. You will write to me therefore&#x2014;about this situation, if Gallaway have done with it&#x2014;otherwise, about whatever comes into your head,&#x2014;only do it soon.</p>
<p>I am not surprised that you have quitted science. The thing designated by that name now-a-days in Britain is little else than a dry bead-roll of facts, good enough for metallurgists and artisans; but tasteless to the <supplied>[so]</supplied>ul&#x2014;as the remainder biscuit of a voyage round the world is tasteless to the body. I have even nearly lost all relish for Mathematics, which some years ago I reckoned the loftiest pursuit of the human intellect. I congratulate you on your approaching entrance into the lists of literature. May the &#x2018;oil&#x2019; you pour into &#x2018;the political cauldron,&#x2019; suffice &#x2018;to make the gruel thick and slab&#x2019;!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, IV, i.</note> at present it is a hideous mess. Are you a prophet of evil or of good?

They are given up to strong delusions&#x2014; What can make them see the cause of all this evil?&#x2014;a larger share of it upon themselves? I augur <pb id="pg-01-253" n="01:253"/>nothing but evil&#x2014;at least for a great while. I had something to say about the flight of time; but my sheet you see is on the point of ending.

<salute>My Dear Irving:</salute>
<p>For the last three weeks, my conscience has frequently reproached me on your account; and tho&#x2019; the frigorific mixture of Hunsteen&#x2019;s terrestrial magnetism and Herr Mohs&#x2019; crystalography that my soul was enveloped in, prevented the things from being so acutely felt as might have been expected, yet they left the proper wounds behind them; and now that I once more breathe the free air, the balsam ought to be applied without delay. To speak without figures&#x2014;for the present one has little to recommend it&#x2014;I shall be too severely punished if you apply the <foreign><hi rend="italic">lex talionis</hi></foreign> to me. Of the two, there is no doubt that I have suffered more severely by my silence. Having no associate; living, I might almost say, only in the abyss of my own thoughts; I cannot without pain, lose sight of one who&#x2014;widely as we differ on many points&#x2014;participates more deeply in my feelings than any other I have met with. You must not doubt that I shall be a most exemplary correspondent during summer; with proper encouragement, I propose not to be as long silent again&#x2014;if I can help it.</p>
<p>You would derive little pleasure or profit from a detail of my insipid journey into Annandale. The road lay over moors and waste land; had it been thro&#x2019; Tempe or Eden, it would have made small difference; the remembrance of the days I had spent with you, and the deep matters we had been discussing,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had visited Irving in <date when="1820-04-00">April</date>. They had discussed Carlyle&#x2019;s opinions concerning Christianity, which were now very different from Irving&#x2019;s.</note> gave a colour to my ideas which the aspect of material nature had little power to alter, and I arrived at Dumfries the second evening after leaving you, in the same humour nearly as we parted. Nothing on my journey pleased me more than the character of a shepherdess&#x2014;not, alas! Arcadian in person or accommodation&#x2014;but the wife of a raw-boned Scottish herd on the <pb id="pg-01-254" n="01:254"/>borders of Dumfriesshire. She was dirty as McClarty<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MacClarty is a character in <hi rend="italic">The Cottages of Glenburnie</hi> (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>), by Elizabeth Hamilton. <hi rend="italic">Clarty</hi> in Scots means &#x201C;dirty.&#x201D;</note> of deathless name, her children squealed, and her husband grunted with the pain of a vanishing inflammatory fever; but whilst I wondered how human beings could support existence on such terms, the arrival of three women from Glasgow revealed a more touching scene. The husband of one of these women, on his way from Glasgow to Dumfries to seek work, had died suddenly in that miserable hovel; his widow, with three little children, was returning to her own country under the guidance of her mother and sister; the tears of these poor forlorn creatures, the genuine heart-felt sympathy and benevolence of poor McClarty altogether formed a picture which moved me deeply. When I left the &#x201C;crib&#x201D;&#x2014;wishing that I were but an angel to relieve these unfortunates&#x2014;I could not help asking: How is it that this poor slut, who has never read of sympathy or examined Sterne and the &#x201C;Man of Feeling,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Man of Feeling</hi> (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>), by Henry Mackenzie (<date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>).</note> can yet experience a sentiment so warm and profound? How have the hardships, the penury, the discomfort of her own situation failed to shut her heart against the hardships, the penury, and discomfort of others? Does experience teach her imagination to represent such evils more vividly? Does refinement lead to naked egotism, as some pretend? Why or how does it happen? I could not say at all; and so winded on my way without deciding the point. Nothing material has occurred to me since I returned to Mainhill. I wrote the first half of Hunsteen and translated, from the German, the first half of Mohs; I rejoice that I have so far done with them. Are not such things the <hi rend="italic">vaccination of science</hi>, as Napoleon spoke? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Elle ne durera pas cinquante ans</hi></foreign> [It will not last fifty years].<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >F.

I wish Goethe were my countryman, I wish&#x2014;O, how I wish&#x2014;he were my friend. It is not for his masterly conception of human nature&#x2014;from the heroes of classical story down to the blackguards of a Leipsic alehouse&#x2014;that I admire him above all others; his profound sentiment of beauty, his most brilliant delineations of all its varieties&#x2014;his gayety of head and melancholy of heart, open all the floodgates of my sympathy. Faust is a wonderful tragedy. I doubt if even Shakespeare with all his powers had sadness enough in his nature to understand the arid and withered feelings of a passionate spirit, worn out by excessive studies and the want of all enjoyment; to delineate the chaos of his thoughts when the secrets of nature are bared before him; to depict his terrible volition and the bitter mockery of the demon gives scope to that volition. All this and much more is done by Goethe; and but for his <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi> cats<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to the Hexenk&#xfc;che scene in <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, Pt. I.</note> and a good deal besides of a like stamp, I should be an unexcepting admirer of the execution. Upon the whole, I advise you strongly to persist in German. These people have some muscle in their frames.</p>
<p>Enough of the polishing and burnishing of our Gallic friends&#x2014;commend me to Fichte rather than Voltaire. I tell you, go on with German&#x2014; I will lend the very best of Schiller&#x2019;s plays&#x2014;(I have lately got them all from Ewan [Swan] of Kirkcaldy) as soon as they are bound. We shall have another point of union by this means; if I had studied Italian still another.</p>

<salute>My dear Fergusson,</salute>
<p>After the candid profession of indolence, which you made previously to my departure from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, it may occassion some surprise too see a creature once so dilatory and deficient in epistolary matters thus bestirring him to perform tasks of supererogation in that line; and unless the aspect of those five guineas pointed to a different conclusion, you might think me wonderfully improved in generosity and all the kindred virtues since we parted. I am sorry to admit that your secondary idea will be the better one. But for the business relating to that cash and about to be laid upon your (I hope) not <hi rend="italic">very</hi> reluctant shoulders, it is any thing but certain that I should so far have vanquished sloth, melancholy and the other powers of darkness as to make any successful efforts towards renewing our correspondence, however profitable and pleasant. Time, and the discontinuance of these eastern blasts which sweep our unsheltered district afflicting man and beast and herb (Edinburgh with its double and triple vortices of dust and rubbish must be a paradise even now!) would certainly have done the business at last; but to the affair, which I must now explain, you certainly owe an acceleration of the trouble and pleasure that the perusal &#x26; answering of a sheet from me may happen to cause.</p>
<p>I ought to begin with a certain decent quantity of excuses and apologies for troubling you, and so on: but after all, the trouble would <pb id="pg-01-257" n="01:257"/>still remain; and you I fear would not be better convinced of my gratitude, than if I let the matter rest in silence. Let it rest there then and wait&#x2014;till I can oblige you&#x2014;for a proof of my thankfulness. The matter is shortly this&#x2014; George Johnstone, for whom you were kind enough to take out several freights of medical books last summer, charged me before his departure to procure for him an Infirmary ticket&#x2014;that by help of it and another winter&#x2019;s attendance in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> after his return from Greenland, he might be enabled to obtain a diploma in the spring of <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After completing the arts curriculum, a student who wished medical qualifications attended classes at the Infirmary, and after submitting a printed dissertation and passing private and public examination, received the degree of M.D. As in the arts courses, Carlyle is here referring to the ticket received on payment of the class fee, entitling the holder to attend lectures and demonstrations.</note> Circumstances of not much importance prevented me from satisfying this request before I left you; and his Mother, a very meritorious widow, having called upon me to express great anxiety and regret on this head, I made bold to comfort her by saying that if the money were remitted to you, out of your great goodnature and benevolence you would not fail to transact the matter in a satisfactory way. If I have not miscalculated, you will therefore proceed so soon as you find it convenient to the Infirmary Janitor, and tell him to get a ticket for Mr George Johnstone, pay him the money and send the article down with letters and what not (by George Farries Ecclefechan carrier) directed to me thro&#x2019; the care of Mrs Dr Johnstone in the village already mentioned. Farries <hi rend="italic">puts up</hi>, as he calls it, at Mrs Reid&#x2019;s candlemaker row;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Candlemaker Row, a street in Edinburgh leading down to the Grassmarket, was once much used by country visitors.</note> and if his porter do not call for the packet, I will take it very kindly in you to find means of giving it to the landlady or the carrier&#x2019;s own hands&#x2014;for he is terribly stupid&#x2014;as the instance of my ill-fated trunk, arrived but yesterday, sufficiently evinces. I do not expect that you will get the ticket on the very day of your receiving this: yet <hi rend="italic">if possible</hi> you must send me a letter tho&#x2019; it should contain but the words &#x2018;I received your parcel safe.&#x2019; The carrier will be back in about a fortnight. I am hurried and stupid&#x2014;but I hope you will comprehend all this, and excuse it and fulfil your part of it, if you can.</p>
<p>When I dipt my pen, for the first time, I had no suspicion that this Cock and Bull story would occupy so large a portion of my sheet: I thought the first leaf would serve. This it is to reckon without our host&#x2014;without estimating the confusion and prolixity of our own brain. <pb id="pg-01-258" n="01:258"/>As matters stand I had as lief call this thing an <hi rend="italic">invoice</hi> as a friend&#x2019;s letter: and at the very last corner, it is too late to think of mending. Wait till the next opportunity, and I shall tell you about the Radicals and Antiradicals of Glasgow&#x2014;the punch is better than the politics of the latter&#x2014;about the inkleweavers<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Weavers of coarse tape. The weavers, more politically aware and better educated than most of the other workers, were particularly involved in the riots.</note> of Paisley, the battle of Drumclog, the ironworks of Muirkirk, and all the other ravishing objects that I saw and felt and handled on my tour.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After staying with Irving at Glasgow in the latter part of <date when="1820-04-00">April</date>, Carlyle had traveled home to Ecclefechan via Paisley, Drumclog, and Muirkirk. More than forty years later, in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> (II, 87&#x2013;91), he found still &#x201C;strangely vivid&#x201D; the memory of the passage over Drumclog Moss and his stay overnight at the &#x201C;famed Iron village&#x201D; of Muirkirk. He also recalled that the battle of Drumclog, won by the Covenanters in <date when="1679-00-00">1679</date>, had recently been introduced by Scott into his <hi rend="italic">Old Mortality</hi>, which thus gave it a &#x201C;double interest.&#x201D; Carlyle covered the last fifty-four miles into Dumfries, on foot, in one day.</note> I will not criticise Go&#xEB;the&#x2019;s Faust&#x2014;but I will tell you that I love and admire the Author. My other books have closed their weary lips&#x2014;leave them to repose! As to my writing&#x2014; The thing on terrestrial magnetism is not even worthy of being despised very heartily&#x2014;and for Mohs<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200419-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1820-04-19">19 April</date></ref>.</note> with his simple and compound forms&#x2014;his first second and third pyramids&#x2014;&#x2018;May the Lord put an end unto all&#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to a popular song.

When I write again, I will tell you more fully about all this&#x2014;and whether I am happy or miserable here&#x2014;which I cannot well decide at present. Wait&#x2014;your patience is not deeply, it will not be long, called for. But tho&#x2019; I content myself with such surface work, your letter (with the ti<supplied>[c]</supplied>ket&#x2014;at farthest) must be infinitely more minute.

The campaign was highly acrimonious. The town council elected Wilson by a vote of 21 to 9, and he served as professor until <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Having just concluded the first volume of Sismondi&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Charles L&#xE9;onard Simonde de Sismondi (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), Swiss historian and economist, author of <hi rend="italic">Trait&#xE9; de la richesse commerciale</hi> (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>), <hi rend="italic">Histoire des r&#xE9;publiques italiennes au moyen &#xE2;ge</hi>, 16 vols. (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1818-00-00">18</date>), <hi rend="italic">Litt&#xE9;rature du Midi de l'Europe</hi>, 4 vols. (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>), <hi rend="italic">Nouveaux Principes d'&#xE9;conomie politique</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>), <hi rend="italic">Histoire des fran&#x26;ccedil;ais</hi>, 31 vols. (<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>), and other works. Carlyle sent Jane Welsh a copy of Sismondi&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Litt&#xE9;rature du midi</hi> with his letter to her of <date when="1822-05-27">27 May 1822</date>, and recommended that she read it: &#x201C;Sismondi is a lively, dapper, elegant little fellow full of good sense and learning and correct sentiment: he resembles our Jeffrey somewhat&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">clever</hi> man, with rather less of natural talent than Jeffrey has, and about ten times as much knowledge and culture.&#x201D; To Robert Mitchell he had written on 
<date when="1819-02-15">15 Feb. 1819</date>: &#x201C;Sismondi (another member of the Geneva Academy) is <foreign><hi rend="italic">un petit homme, vieux, mais vif, tres vif</hi></foreign>.&#x201D; Although Carlyle appears to have kept the fact quiet in the main, it can now be definitely stated that he translated the long article &#x201C;Political Economy&#x201D; which Sismondi wrote for Brewster&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</hi>, published in a volume which came off the press in <date when="1824-12-00">Dec. 1824</date>. On <date when="1824-01-07">7 Jan. 1824</date>, while he was living with the Bullers at Kinnaird House, Dunkeld, his brother John wrote to him from Edinburgh: &#x201C;Thomson (Balfour&#x2019;s foreman) has sent his &#x2018;Devil&#x2019; a dozen times within the last two or three days about the translation of Sismondi&#x2019;s Political Economy. I told him you had finished the Translation some time ago; but had given me no instructions regarding it. I suspect you have committed a mistake in not sending the Translation (as perhaps you intended) with the original Manuscript and Buller&#x2019;s books. It is wanted immediately: I promised to tell you so, and said I should hear from you about the beginning of next week&#x2014; You might send it by the coach, or perhaps by the Dunkeld carrier.&#x201D; On <date when="1820-01-28">28 Jan.</date> John wrote that he and Thomas Murray were now reading some of the proof sheets of the article but that &#x201C;they are in no great hurry about printing it.&#x201D; Finally, Dr. David Brewster wrote to Carlyle on <date when="1820-12-29">29 Dec.</date> to say that the &#x201C;weary half-volume of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia</hi>&#x201D; containing the article had at last come out &#x201C;only a week ago&#x201D; and that Carlyle or his deputy could now collect payment for the translation. Sismondi&#x2019;s connection with Brewster may have come about through his wife, who had been a Miss Allen, sister of Sir James Mackintosh&#x2019;s wife. Carlyle&#x2019;s familiarity with Sismondi&#x2019;s ideas about economics at this early date is significant and undoubtedly influenced his own later thinking on the subject. Like Sismondi, he attacked the optimistic, laissez faire doctrines of Adam Smith and the other &#x201C;classical&#x201D; economists, protested against the prevailing system which emphasized the importance of increasing wealth without facing the problem of using this wealth to produce general happiness, called on government to use intelligent controls, but failed to prescribe specific measures that would be adequate and remained somewhat gloomy about the subject. Carlyle&#x2019;s knowledge of Sismondi, as well as his knowledge of Malthus, may have caused him to call political economy &#x201C;the dismal science.&#x201D; [A user comment on this footnote can be found in the Revision History.]</note> history, and <pb id="pg-01-260" n="01:260"/>the other not being yet arrived from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I think I cannot better employ the hour of leisure, which necessarily intervenes between the end of this and the beginning of a fresh employment, than in returning you my thanks for the kind and good-humoured letter which I received last Saturday. Perhaps you may think me somewhat hasty in my movements; but you ought to recollect that the fault I am going to commit is not very likely to recur; and most of all, that, opportunity which is justly painted with locks before, is altogether bald behind. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Fronte capillata, post, est occassio calva</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Although chance has hair at the front of her head, she is bald behind&#x201D; (Cato, <hi rend="italic">Disticha de Moribus</hi>, II, 26).

<p>I like to see a friend write from the heart,&#x2014;somewhat in earnest&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it be a little in dishabille. It indicates at least the absence of excessive <hi rend="italic">caution</hi>&#x2014;a Scottish quality&#x2014;but one which I am not patriot enough to respect very highly. Upon the whole, I am glad that this business of Mr Vicars&#x2019; has occurred&#x2014;and not sorry that it is so settled. Your conduct in the matter affords me a practical proof of your desire to shew me kindness: and tho&#x2019; I knew this theoretically well enough before, yet one cannot be too well convinced of a truth so palatable. Who knows but in the shiftings of this great country-dance, I may yet have a better opportunity to shew my gratitude than mere words can give me?</p>
<p>I am '<hi rend="italic">cute</hi> enough to perceive that your second mode of settlement in York is not less a jest than the first. Come and see you, my dear sir! When Jack the Giant-Killer doffed his seven-league boots, did he send them into Annandale? Have I the hippogriff of Astolpho<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Ariosto&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Orlando Furioso</hi> Astolpho rides a hippogriff on many fabulous voyages.</note> to ride upon?&#x2014;or are my coffers so crammed with money that the expence of travelling a hundred and fifty British miles (a hundred and fifty, by <pb id="pg-01-261" n="01:261"/>Arrowsmith&#x2019;s map,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A New General Atlas</hi> (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>), by Aaron Arrowsmith (<date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>).</note> as the crow flies) would be nothing but a wholesome depletion for them? But it seems, I am to devote an hour each day to your improvement. Here lies the very cream of the jest,&#x2014;I am far from vain enough to think myself capable of improving you in any branch of useful knowledge: and tho&#x2019; I did, I would advise you to consider before continuing your career of acquirements. Is Happiness our being&#x2019;s end and aim? All men believe so.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle was to reject this opinion soon.</note> Then why covet more Knowledge than can be comfortably bartered against the banknotes or the applause of our neighbours? Will intellectual superiority do any thing but disgust us more deeply with the contrast between what is and what ought to be? &#x2018;Those thoughts that wander thro&#x2019; Eternity&#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 148.</note>&#x2014;what do they but plunge us farther into the abysses of our mysterious being&#x2014;and reveal to us more clearly the blackness and rottenness of every object which our fancy would, otherwise, gild most brightly? O! Commend me to the innocent gentleman, whose sober wishes never learned to stray<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gray&#x2019;s &#x201C;Elegy,&#x201D; l. 74.</note> beyond the amassing of &#x2018;certain monies&#x2019;&#x2014;and obtaining the title of verger or Mayor or <foreign>Custos Rotulorum</foreign> [Guard of the Little Wheels],<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <foreign><hi rend="italic">custos rotulorum</hi></foreign> is the chief civil officer or principal justice of the peace of a county, to whose custody are committed the records or rolls of the session.</note> to give them dignity in the eyes of men. He forms no general propositions: hence every object is a novelty. He asks not whence he came into this vortex of existence, or whither he is tending. Ignorance&#x2014;you say.&#x2014; But does he not eat his muffin every morning, and his beef every evening, with a tranquil heart: and when the three-score and ten years of his pilgrimage are completed, does he not lie down calmly on the pillow of superstition, to sleep sound in the bosom of his mother, tho&#x2019; never to eat beef or muffins any more? You will call me paradoxical; but then you must attack my premises; for otherwise I defy Euclid himself to budge one stone of my conclusion.</p>
<p>After all, however, I think, if it pay, you do well to write on politics. The harvest truly is great but the labourers are few.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 9:37.</note> There seems at the present a general fermentation of minds, an indeterminate longing after something new, and a heart-felt nausea of the ancient nostrums which have so long delighted us. I am not of those who argue that the era of <hi rend="italic">derision</hi> <supplied>[has ar]</supplied>rived and that henceforth we must <pb id="pg-01-262" n="01:262"/>shift away with bare-faced selfishness and cold mockery as we best may. Believing that the human character has in it an unfathomable store of enthusiasm, I wish only for a proper channel to hold and direct that enthusiasm; and augur, in that case, nothing but boundless melioration for ages yet to come. It is doubtless, however, a sign of the times, that so few writers or speakers of eminence have yet appeared to regulate or awaken the current of public thought.

<salute>Dear Fergusson,</salute>
<p>I have been taken, as they say, completely at a disadvantage. When I received your short but satisfactory note,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> this day week, I expected to have abundant time for writing you a long letter; and I confidently anticipated the pleasure of unfolding a great variety of <pb id="pg-01-264" n="01:264"/>curious matter to your patient and friendly eyes: but the carrier with his wonted indecision is about to set off early on Monday-morning; and this intelligence, which I received, about half past seven, along with a letter from Waugh, compels me to postpone all those agreeable anticipations, and to content myself with writing or rather scribbling a most hurried epistle&#x2014;which I beg you to pardon in consideration of these circumstances&#x2014;</p>
<p>You are not a friend to &#x2018;preambles&#x2019; it would seem; and I am endangering your calmness of soul on that score again. To the point, then, while the game is good&#x2014; In good truth, I would not have troubled you with this large bundle of books, if I could have avoided it but I know not Waugh&#x2019;s lodgings&#x2014;he dates &#x2018;City of the North&#x2019;; and to whom can I apply? If you can get them exchanged to-day, I shall be very glad: if you have not time, let them lie in your chamber till some opportunity (within a fortnight) occurs of carrying them to the library&#x2014;or of delivering them to the dextrous individual above mentioned, who has voluntarily bound himself to undertake such tasks for me. I shall inclose the list and the receipts, or numbers at least. Let it rest then at present.</p>
<p>I have not seen Dixon,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frank Dickson was to go to Bermuda in the autumn of this year.</note> and cannot conjecture whether he is returned to Annandale or still in your city: consequently I have not got the letter you promised; but I hope the return of Farries will put into my hands a long account of all your proceedings, independent of any such contingency. Really I feel some lively paroxysms of curiosity to know what you are following&#x2014;and how time flows with you. Is medicine getting more agreeable? or are you to buffet the ocean in your own solitary bark&#x2014;unaided by compass or by convoy? What are you studying, thinking, hoping? My dear Sir, you should write me all those things down upon paper. It would interest <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and do good to yourself. Black and white is the thing for clearing and arranging ones ideas upon any point. It affords a stimulus&#x2014; But I have now no room for philosophy&#x2014;less for philosophy falsely so called. Again, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> is becoming of John Wilson&#x2019;s chair? Consider I see no Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> paper, scarcely a scotch one indeed; and I would not be ignorant of such matters. Dr. Irving<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Irving (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), biographer and librarian. He became principal librarian to the Faculty of Advocates (in what became the National Library of Scotland) in <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date> and resigned in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>. His <hi rend="italic">History of Scottish Poetry</hi>, begun in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>, appeared in <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>, edited by Dr. John A. Carlyle.</note> I hear is Advocates&#x2019; librarian; but what are the <pb id="pg-01-265" n="01:265"/><hi rend="italic">patricians</hi> &#x26; <hi rend="italic">knights</hi> of the literary commonwealth doing? Any thing new? any thing special? as the Yankees say.</p>
<p>It may seem to you a strange metamorphosis, that, I the frigid disregarder of all things should so suddenly be changed into the inquisitive <foreign><hi rend="italic">quid-nunc</hi></foreign> [a man always asking, &#x201C;What now?&#x201D;]. I do not certainly desire you to think me a news-ferret, or any creature of that genus: but in truth I have no company here or very little&#x2014;and tidings, however unimportant, from a scene which, consider it as we may, is deeply interwoven with many thoughts and recollections&#x2014;are a kind of event to a rusticating person such as I<supplied>[.]</supplied> How is it that the heart, sated &#x26; withered&#x2014;frequently experiences pain from the want of objects, the possession of which has long ceased to yeild any perceptible delig<supplied>[ht?]</supplied></p>
<p>Upon the whole, I <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> incline to think that I am improving in health&#x2014;and I have no doubt that my spirits are better since I left Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. The former would be good but for those ill-fated intestines of mine. Cannot you in your great medical acumen succeed in prescribing for me. I try all kinds of food&#x2014;and why should I complaine? If I walk enough, I am well enough. However, I study next to none&#x2014;or rather absolutely none. Soaring and hovering in the cloudy regions of German metaphysics is not study. No more is reading about &#x2018;Cornlaws&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly <hi rend="italic">Corn Laws and Trade, Supplement to the 5th Ed. of the Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi>, III (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>), by John Ramsay McCulloch (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>).</note> Quakers or the &#x2018;city of the Plague.&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">City of the Plague and Other Poems</hi> (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>), by John Wilson.</note> By the way&#x2014;can you spare me the first volume of Pascal&#x2014;his life?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres de Blaise Pascal avec discours sur la vie</hi>, ed.

<salute>My dear Murray,</salute>
<p>I received your letter with much pleasure and not without some surprise. Your silence had been so long and, as it seemed, so obstinate, that I despaired, except by unusual good fortune of hearing from you any more, for a number of years. It appears that you have never met with a letter which I took the liberty of writing to you, in <date when="1819-06-00">June 1819</date>, from the port of Workington.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray had written on <date when="1820-07-22">22 July</date>: &#x201C;I felt an unwillingness to write you as somehow or other I thought that I stood low in your estimation&#x2014;from some expressions in one of your Letters, and from some little mistakes and blunders on my part (which vexed me much) respecting certain Italian Books which you very kindly lent me.&#x2014; Allow me to express a hope in passing that they came to you safe.&#x201D; Carlyle had written on <date when="1819-06-07">7 June 1819</date> but Murray seems not to have received the letter. It seems possible that Murray did not receive the preceding letter either, acknowledging receipt of the books (<date when="1819-04-14">14 April 1819</date>) which would mean he had heard nothing since Carlyle&#x2019;s cold letter demanding them (<date when="1819-03-16">16 March</date>). Carlyle on <date when="1819-06-07">7 June</date> mentions a letter from Murray; but as he says he has not heard anything more about the Isle of Man post, this may well be the letter of <date when="1819-03-20">20 March</date>.</note> Yet the Wigton Skipper (I forget his name and his ship&#x2019;s) promised fair, and seemed a truthful clown: his rude plainness of speech seduced James Johnston into a belief that he would carry you a packet carefully; and James being on the eve of embarking for Acadia, I was persuaded to envelope his adieus in a long sheet&#x2014; containing nothing definite that I can recollect, but my address and a hope to hear from you on my return to Annandale. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Fronti nulla fides</hi></foreign> [Put no faith in appearances]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Juvenal, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>, II, 8.</note> is an old and (under favour of Lavater, Spurzheim<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Kaspar Lavater (<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>&#x2013;<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>), Swiss physiognomist; Johann Kaspar Spurzheim (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), German phrenologist.</note> and the rest) a true adage: the caitiff has lit his pipe with the letters, and infested our minds with <pb id="pg-01-267" n="01:267"/>dis<supplied>[a]</supplied>gre<supplied>[e]</supplied>able ideas of one another. I do not think you will grudge the postage of a letter tending to dispel such ideas; and for that reason&#x2014;strengthened by the view of gratifying myself&#x2014;I have sat down to write you without a moment&#x2019;s delay.</p>
<p>My dear Sir, how could it get into your head that &#x2018;you stood low in my estimation&#x2019;? The words that conveyed such an impression must indeed have been ill-chosen&#x2014;whenever they were used. Graglia&#x2019;s dictionary and the rest came safely as well as timeously to hand;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Graglia&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of the Italian and English Languages</hi>. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190219-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1819-02-19">19 Feb. 1819</date></ref>.</note> and tho&#x2019; the articles had been entirely destroyed&#x2014;do you think I would have quarrelled with you about so trifling an affair? It has been my chance to meet with <hi rend="italic">some</hi> whose sympathy has brightened, at times, the gloomy labyrinth of life; but not to meet <hi rend="italic">so many</hi>, that, I could sacrifice them upon grounds like this. I pray you to put away such thoughts utterly. Our paths may lead us far asunder; but the place will be distant, the period remote, when I forget the calmness and happiness of bygone days, or the amiable qualities that contributed so largely to make them calm and happy.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Our correspondence has of late assumed a most tortuous and complicated character. You sent me the books all safe and right, I know <pb id="pg-01-269" n="01:269"/>not how long since; the packet containing Johnstone&#x2019;s ticket arrived here about a week ago! This is very queer. Our letters have been travelling the road at regular intervals&#x2014;but never one has been a reply to another! So two coach-drivers will course over the same ten mile<supplied>[s]</supplied>&#x2014;meet in the middle&#x2014;be in the same houses daily&#x2014;and never speak, till time or whisky has disabled one of them&#x2014;after having gathered in his curricle (olympic?) dust, for many years. This is all well upon his majesty&#x2019;s highway: but the emblem of a very disagre<supplied>[e]</supplied>able state among friends. We are to begin, then, upon new ground&#x2014;the present epistle being the first of a long series to be regularly transmitted and as regularly answered. I intend to perform my part honestly: if you fail, your blood be upon your own head!</p>
<p>I have said already that the books, ticket &#x26;c came all safe and sound. I am <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much obliged for all this trouble: and not least for the effort you have made to write me so long and so pleasant a letter. I know how much those efforts cost you: if they always succeed as well as this, it is pity they are made so rarely.</p>
 <p>Do you still intend to visit Annandale? If you were here at present, in addition to whatever charms the country might disclose, you would have the satisfaction to see Edw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Irving in the land of his nativity. I expect to find him at Annan to-day. The sentiment of a brother as teacher of Mathematics in their Academy leads me down,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had taken Carlyle&#x2019;s old post as mathematical instructor at Annan Academy.</note> and I hear Mr Edward is looked for. He has been in Dublin three weeks&#x2014;at Liverpool&#x2014;in Perthshire, and various parts.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving set off to Dublin on <date when="1820-07-10">10 July</date> after a visit to the Highlands in a party with Margaret Gordon, who was about to go to London. He stayed there several weeks, writing to Carlyle on <date when="1820-07-24">24 July</date> that he hoped to set off for Liverpool on <date when="1820-07-30">30 July</date> and to spend the rest of the week traveling north to Annandale. He seems to have stayed in Liverpool longer than he intended, missed Carlyle on <date when="1820-08-05">5 Aug.</date>, and writes announcing that he will be in Annan on <date when="1820-08-15">15 Aug.</date> for the &#x201C;ordination&#x201D; and will see Carlyle then. After completing his studies, a Scottish divinity student is &#x201C;licensed&#x201D; to preach but not to administer the sacraments. This was the condition of Irving at Kirkcaldy and at Glasgow. The candidate is then &#x201C;ordained&#x201D; to the full ministry by his native presbytery (which also, in Irving&#x2019;s case, condemned him to be ejected from the church in <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>).</note> I have heard but twice from him since my departure from Glasgow. You have seen him since: and found, I daresay, that he retains the same exuberant enthusiasm and warm benevolence as ever. Upon the whole, I augur great things from Irving. Circumstances have directed all the current of his powers into the channel of preaching; his views are not so likely to change <pb id="pg-01-270" n="01:270"/>now; he is fairly in the ring too; his opponents are but pigmies&#x2014;and Irving like the old Mendoza<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel Mendoza (<sic><date when="1764-00-00">1764</date></sic><corr><date when="1756-00-00">1756</date>?</corr>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), boxer, long retired by now.

<p>Let us wish him good speed, in the path he has entered; his intentions are honourable, and deserve success.&#x2014; I need not say that I should rejoice to see you in Dumfriesshire.

 <p>I am very much pleased to hear that you are acquainted with Mr Welsh. Few young men deserve to stand higher in your esteem. Make my most respectful &#x26; kind compliment&#x2019;s to him.

<p>I do not think, my dear fellow, that there is the smallest vanity in assuming the title you suggest.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It was easy for me to understand and excuse the silence for which you apologize. A philosopher engaged in illuminating &#x2018;the various political parties that agitate and divide Great Britain,&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a quotation from Allen&#x2019;s letter, which has not been found.</note> may well be pardoned for remissness in prosecuting so trivial a correspondence as ours. And had I felt any chagrin at your apparent negligence, the occassion of your present letter could not have failed to reconcile me. I look upon it as another instance of your kind attention, for which I am bound to return my grateful acknowledgements: and whatever be the issue of this matter, your conduct in it can excite but one feeling.</p>
<p>The anxiety, you express, would of itself have induced me to answer your proposal without a moment&#x2019;s delay; and besides this, I have another reason for despatch. During the last four weeks, I have been occupied principally with winding up several small concerns, <pb id="pg-01-272" n="01:272"/>compilations, translations &#x26;c, necessary to be concluded before visiting Edinburgh, whither I intended shortly to proceed once more. This travelling-tutorship<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clearly Allen had written Carlyle some details concerning the possibility of his tutoring a mentally subnormal (thought later by Carlyle to be an idiot) younger brother of John Hutton of Sobergate in the township of Newby Wiske and the parish of Kirby Wiske near Northallerton, Yorkshire. Various county histories of Yorkshire indicate that in <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date> John Hutton purchased Sober Manor from George Osbaldestone; and in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date> he built a new house which he called Solberge.</note> would, of course, overturn my plans; and as it really seems to be an affair worth examining, I have taken the earliest opportunity to communicate my views of the subject, that it may be finally arranged as soon as possible. I shall speak with all imaginable freedom, and I beg of you to give me a serious and patient hearing.</p>
<p>It is plain that, without farther information, I cannot <supplied>[co]</supplied>me to any decision&#x2014;so much depends on a variety of circumstances, yet unknown to me, which may totally alter the face of the question. If the young Gentleman&#x2019;s disorder is of a gloomy and fretful kind; the perpetual sympathy, the unwearied attention, the boundless patience, which his case would require, might perhaps be faithfully discharged, at the call of friendship, but scarcely for the sake of gain by a man possessing any sensitivity, and, I fear, not at all, by a man possessing none. On the other hand I can conceive an innocent tho&#x2019; feeble state of mind, which&#x2014;as it would less frequently afflict our selfish feelings, and oftener address itself to our social affections&#x2014;one might feel it always tolerable, sometimes even pleasant to strengthen and soothe. I shall therefore desire you to describe, as minutely as you can, what is actually the nature of the Gentleman&#x2019;s situation; what are his age and previous habits; what is the mode of treatment to be adopted with him; where he usually resides, and where he is to travel; with any other particulars which you may think will serve to give me a more accurate idea of the duties required from his Guardian. One circumstance you must not neglect to notice: the proportion of time likely to be consumed in the superintendance. A great part of each day may naturally be reckoned on: but the whole of it is quite a different matter, and certainly some strong consideration would be requisite to make me forego the hope of enjoying a little leisure to devote to those pursuits, which have hitherto constituted my chief solace in the world. I am nearly tired of what is called natural science, mathematics, and the ordinary systems of philosophy; yet this has not <pb id="pg-01-273" n="01:273"/>prevented me from coasting all summer on the borders of German or Italian literature: and in winter, it was my purpose to spread out &#x2018;sailbroad vans&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 297.</note> and explore the secrets of those vast seas. Schiller and Alfieri are here, Goethe is but gone, <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Dante is daily expected, I am but half thro&#x2019; Sismondi, and a host of others are not yet begun. The muse Calliope has used me sorrily, indeed; yet still the syren flits before one, beautiful as the morning&#x2019;s eyes; and the light that irradiates her, shews like &#x2018;light from Heaven.&#x2019; Tell me if it would be necessary to abandon all this&#x2014;Scots Law hardly requires so much.</p>
<p>Another point scarce less material is the senior brother&#x2019;s character, and the footing on which he is likely to receive the proposed tutor. I reckon the liberality of opinion, which you mention, an important fact. But more are requisite to shew me whether an inferior shall ever, in the company of this Gentleman, be enabled to forget&#x2014;I say not transgress&#x2014;the barriers which discriminate the different ranks of society, and to speak with him as man to man; or whether, being hemmed in every side by invisible fences&#x2014;tied down like Gulliver in Lilliput by <supplied>[a]</supplied> thousand packthreads,&#x2014;which singly he might break as gossamer, tho&#x2019; together they are strong as the chains of Prometheus&#x2014;the poor creature shall lead a life of misery, the more disgusting as it is the more petty. I would especially know this. A life of solitude may or may not be spent with profit&#x2014;it is sure to be spent with pain; and the pain of populous solitude is worst of all.</p>
<p>Now before you can depict every one of those things to me, with the proper degree of minuteness and fidelity, I am afraid your patience will be found wanting. Yet as they are essential for me to know, I doubt not you will take a clear sheet, adopt a smaller type than usual, and expound the whole matter as it ought. This letter, you will probably see, is intended for your exclusive perusal: when it is answered, I shall send you my determination to be shewn in &#x2018;the proper quarter.&#x2019; I have not mentioned salary. It <supplied>[will]</supplied> be regulated in some degree by the duties. I recollect &#xa3;100 was the sum talked <supplied>[of]</supplied> when I left Kirkcaldy: but this is not at all the most material part of the bargain. I know you will write to me as soon as convenient&#x2014;so I do not speak of it. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>.</salute></closer></p>

</bibl><sourceNote>TC-WG, <date when="1820-09-15">15 Sept.</date> Addr: 36. Vincent Street, / Glasgow. MS: David L. Graham. Pbd: Graham, <hi rend="italic">CG</hi>, pp. 8&#x2013;11. The text of all letters to and from William Graham is based on Graham, <hi rend="italic">CG</hi>, collated against a typescript of the manuscript letters lent by Mr. David L. Graham. Born in <date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>, the son of Thomas Graham of Burnswark (properly Birrenswark, or fortification work, once the site of a Roman camp three miles north of Ecclefechan), William had left his father&#x2019;s farm just before the turn of the century to join his brother John in New York and take part in the shipping firm formed by him. He was shortly followed by Elizabeth, his sister, and by a third brother, Peter. The house of Graham Brothers first prospered and expanded into branches in Philadelphia and Glasgow. William returned to Glasgow in <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date> to manage the branch there. Then came financial collapse of the whole firm. In semi-retirement at the time of this letter, William returned permanently to Burnswark in 
<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>. His sister kept house for him there, and he lived out his life raising sheep and visiting old friends. He was still alive in <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>, when he attended the funeral of Carlyle&#x2019;s mother.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You must dispense with Dixon&#x2019;s acknowledgment for the letter you so kindly sent him; and content yourself with mine instead of those which should have come from both. Frank set out on Friday; and owing to the negligence of our little postmaster the packet was withheld till next Monday: so that tho&#x2019; I instantly mounted <hi rend="italic">that</hi> unhappy shelty, and proceeded to Dumfries, the place of his embarkation, where I hoped the emigrant still continued wind-bound, as fast as its small limbs could carry me, I found the Queensberry sloop&#x2014;sailed for Liverpool two tides before. Having again enclosed the note, I entrusted it to Armstrong of Hook, by whose means, I doubt not, Dixon has already got it, and flatters himself with the prospect of happily encountering its owner in the Western Land.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frank Dickson arrived in Bermuda on <date when="1820-12-23">23 Dec. 1820</date> after a stay of six weeks in New York. He gives Carlyle an account of his trip in a letter of <date when="1821-06-20">20 June 1821</date> preserved in the NLS. It appears that Graham had written a letter of reference for Dickson which Carlyle sent to him through his brother John. Dickson writes: &#x201C;By your kind services in Scotland I received a little more attention in N. York, than I otherwise could have expected in that abominable Yankee city.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>You distress me exceedingly by the gloomy and despondent colour, which your mind but too plainly appears to have assumed, since we parted. It is true that from experience I can know but little of your situation: yet I have felt what it is to be wretched&#x2014;wretched to the very heart&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; my sympathy can be of little value, it is deeply and faithfully offered. I know how barren are the usual topics of <pb id="pg-01-275" n="01:275"/>consolation&#x2014;how they pass over a mind diseased, like sunshine over a bottomless abyss&#x2014;and to advise you may seem presumptuous in one of my inexperience. Yet I would remind you, my friend, that all is not lost. Tho' the fortune which honourable and industrious enterprise amassed should in fact be scattered to the winds; the integrity and skill which amassed it remain unimpaired behind. Do not then despair. Consider <hi rend="italic">what</hi> may yet be done, and do it with a resolute mind. A thousand instances will readily occur of persons who have gloriously recovered from embarrassment as deep as that you labour under: And if after all, this should not be your destiny; look the matter steadily in the face, and its hideousness disappears. If you get the neglect or even the pity of many cold and shallow persons, whose God <hi rend="italic">is</hi> prosperity; is not the respectful sympathy of one true-hearted man sufficient to compensate for it all? You enjoy such sympathy, I know, from many men; and misfortune will never make you lose it. Evils enough are connected with the loss of wealth, indeed, do what we may: but you ought to reflect that in this case no one suffers but yourself; no children look to you for support; and the grey hairs of your parents have gone peacefully down to that still country where misfortune never comes. I know you have thought of all this a hundred times already; I know you are already determined to strain every sinew that no mean or advantage which yet remains&#x2014;however slight&#x2014;may be neglected: but such thoughts and resolutions cannot be too often repeated or too strongly confirmed; and I am sure you will excuse my unasked condolence, and judge more correctly than to impute it to vain loquacity or idle officiousness. But I will not continue the subject farther; because tho&#x2019; matters look drearily at present, I am convinced that your efforts <hi rend="italic">will</hi> yet put everything to rights. I have the strongest persuasion that I shall see you many a time joyful as ever in the new town of Glasgow: and afterwards when I get a house&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> too is preordained&#x2014;I know that I shall meet you there, and finally demonstrate that &#x201C;entaits&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently a playful reference to the word <hi rend="italic">entailing</hi> in Graham&#x2019;s letter. Graham had written: &#x201C;[David] Hope is gone to Manchester to see a Cousin of his from Botany Bay, a widow, who has been a &#x2018;thrifty sort of person,&#x2019; it seems, for she has realized a large fortune and has landed property in Van Diemans Land. She says she has <hi rend="italic">entailed</hi> upon her son! What think you of entailing property there? The old lady must be an original.&#x201D;</note> whether in Van Dieman&#x2019;s Land or Britain are fatal things and worthy of all condemnation. This is like a dream; but you will see it happen in process of time.</p>
<p>In fact I care not how soon it happen, the <hi rend="italic">saughs</hi> of Mainhill <pb id="pg-01-276" n="01:276"/>afford but a scanty shelter, and Goethe with all his fellow singers, tho&#x2019; they might console a disembodied spirit, with some lunar gleams of happiness&#x2014;are very insufficient for a man of flesh and blood. You are distressed by too much sensation of outward things; I by too little; and thus you see &#x201C;the fruit of that forbidden tree&#x201D; which lost us Eden, lies like a fund of aloes in the heart of every son of Adam. I hear not of Margaret,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Gordon. Graham had written: &#x201C;I have heard nothing yet of the accomplished, incomparable Margaret. I am surprised that Irving did not fall in love with that exalted creature; but it seems that he did not leave Kirkcaldy heart-whole.&#x201D; Irving&#x2019;s letters indicate that he was fascinated by Margaret, if not in love with her.</note> and know not if I ever shall. Such beings are shadows, radiant shadows, that cross our path in this dark voyage; we gaze on them with rapture for a moment; and pass away&#x2014;borne onward by the tide of Fate, never to behold them, never more.&#x2014; Nor do I hear of Irving except through your letter. Tell him it is well to be diligent; but he ought to forswear thin potations. Milk for a man of his kidney is little better than a meal of east wind. You may say besides that he is an epistle in my debt, and runs a risk of soon being two.&#x2014; Mr. Carlile<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Warrand Carlile (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">1893</date>).

He married Agnes (&#x201C;Nancy&#x201D;), youngest sister of Edward Irving, <date when="1820-09-24">Tuesday, 24 Sept. 1820</date> (hence Carlyle was wrong in thinking the wedding over). The Carliles had a son the following year who became a minister in the Free Church.</note> I have not seen or heard of. But I suppose the wedding is over and the honey-moon progressing slick right away! The man is a very honest good man; and his track thro&#x2019; life lies as straight before him as a row of cabbages. I wish and predict for him all manner of calmness and contentment.&#x2014; You see that I have not room for my furnishings to Brewster.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s contributions to Dr. David Brewster&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</hi>.</note> In fact they are not worth room; and anyway I suppose none of them are printed yet. I need not say how much I should be gratified by another letter from you&#x2014;good news if possible&#x2014;if not any news.&#x2014; In revenge I should have paid the postage on this occasion; but I listen to the voice of mercy and forbear.&#x2014; The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. <closer><salute>Pardon this gossipy will o' the wisp letter, and believe me to be,</salute></closer></p>

<p>Many thanks, my dear Sir, for the punctual attention you have paid to my request. I have considered the matter over again, in the new light which your information has cast on it; I find your statements inviting on the whole; and tho&#x2019; I have not yet had opportunity to take the requisite advice concerning this affair, I seem to feel my own mind rather inclining towards visiting your county. I shall be able finally to decide next week: and in the mean time, I think it would be advisable to apprise the Gentleman of this result; to say that I am willing to treat with him about the proposal, and hence that I desire to have an explanation of the duties and emolument, from his own hand, with the expected time of entry, and other customary points;&#x2014;that so the thing may be put in a proper train for receiving its final adjustment. I shall of course learn whether any farther recommendations or testimonials are needed&#x2014;besides the apparently unmerited one&#x2019;s, which you have given me. Most probably it will be best to engage but for a year at first: and with regard to salary, I still incline to suppose that &#xa3;150 is not an excessive sum; the duties will involve a considerable sacrifice of time, and, at first any way, of inclination; the distance from York, besides its other disadvantages, will occassion an additional expense in the article of materials for study; <hi rend="italic">besides a hundred and a half has something complete in the sound of it</hi>; and for all these reasons, tho&#x2019; I do not as yet insist on it as an indispensable preliminary, I wish to have this sum specified as the reward which is likely to content me.</p>
<p>So soon as ever the Gentleman can find it convenient to explain all this to me&#x2014;the letter <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> arrive here before Friday or so&#x2014;I shall be in a condition to reply by return of post, and to conclude this business, I hope, to the entire satisfaction of all parties.</p>
<p>The present letter, you see, is one of mere detail, and dull as such letters usually are. I shall talk of your book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Lectures on the Temper and Spirit of the Christian Religion</hi> (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>), by Matthew Allen, M.D.</note>&#x2014;which I expect shortly to see&#x2014;and of all the works you have wrought at another time. <closer><salute>Meanwhile, believe me to be (with many unexpressed apologies for all this trouble),</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>According to your anticipation, Mr Hutton<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200915-TC-MAL-01">TC to <sic>MA</sic><corr>MAL</corr>, <date when="1820-09-15">15 Sept.</date></ref></note> did write&#x2014;about a week after your letter&#x2014;and generously proposed to come as far as Dumfries for the purpose of an interview; I assented of course, but suggested the preferable advantages of Annan; Ecclefechan was then fixed upon, and I calculated that my present letter would release you from all farther trouble about this business; when &#x2018;indispensable necessity&#x2019;&#x2014;so said the Gentleman&#x2019;s letter of last night&#x2014;compelled him to abandon that plan, and <hi rend="italic">invite</hi> me to see you in the city of York&#x2014;he &#x2018;cheerfully&#x2019; paying travelling expenses&#x2014;that so this affair may be completely arranged by a personal conference at last. I again assented, for there is no hard stuff in me: and hence you are to look for my arrival very shortly. As I still preserve some faint glimmerings of sanity, I cannot aspire to a lodging at the Asylum; but if during the interim you could find me any decent place of abode for a few days, and situated so that we may be very near each other,&#x2014;it would be the last exertion required of you on this occasion, tho&#x2019; not, as your indolence might hope, the last of all, with which, for the sake of your sins, it is foreordained that you shall be saddled on my account. I have a kind of natural antipathy to inns: but if you find this requisition difficult to comply with, I can make shift in one of those establishments for the brief space necessary. Therefore be not too anxious.</p>
<p>I cannot speak absolutely about the time of my arrival. I purpose to be in Carlisle about 7 o&#x2019;clock on Wednesday morning:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This would be <date when="1820-10-11">11 Oct.</date></note>&#x2014;where after is known only to the Fates&#x2014;and to the coach proprietors of that venerable city. Inspecting the map, there seems to be a probability of your hearing from me on Thursday-morning&#x2014;on Friday at all events, except for want of health or some other unfor<supplied>[e]</supplied>seen cause.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-279" n="01:279"/>Should <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Squire and I conclude a bargain, I shall certainly require to be &#x2018;drilled&#x2019;&#x2014; Any way I expect much pleasure from talking over old byegone things, from discussing Sp&#xfc;rzheimism,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spurzheim first went to England in <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date> and visited it afterward.

There is a kind of delight in taking the bit out of Pegasus his mouth, and suffering him to caper and curvet and career, as best beseems him, thro&#x2019; all the spheres and vortices of this immortal mind.&#x2014; As for the &#x2018;christian lectures&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Allen&#x2019;s recently published book.</note>&#x2014;if my influence were any thing but a nonentity in the republic of letters, I would most cheerfully lend it to forward that performance; both for the sake of its author and the Public, which labouring at present under a hot fever, needs <hi rend="italic">anodynes</hi> more than ought else. Have you sent copies to all the reviewers, magazine editors and others of that tribe?

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am just returned from Yorkshire, and before falling to any settled employment, I design to allow myself the gratification of answering your kind and friendly letter. It came cost free as was expected, and I assure you that not even the weighty sum of sixteen pence halfpenny could have at all sensibly diminished the pleasure I felt in perusing it. Certainly nothing was farther from my thoughts than <hi rend="italic">offence</hi> at your judicious counsels respecting the occasion of my late journey; and as the affair is now terminated, I think it but reasonable to communicate the result, about which you appear to experience so obliging a concern.</p>

Any good lively orangoutang would have formed a more eligible companion than such a monster. The rest of the family were sound of body&#x2014;and for soul, they did not pretend to have any&#x2014;all except the brother to whom this negative character cannot justly apply. He had a soul, but it was the soul of a hog; as good-natured and stupid and obscene and nasty as the filthiest hog. It is needless to say that &#xa3;150 could not tempt me to accept the place: I would not even live among them for the fee simple of Potosi.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town in Bolivia renowned for its &#x201C;silver mountain, &#x201D; once the richest silver mine in the world.</note> We parted, however, in good humor; the Huttons made a new arrangement for their natural, and I turned proudly back to virtue and intellect and moral dignity&#x2014;and poverty, if she too must follow me&#x2014;in our Fathers&#x2019; land.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, I incline to place the men of Euredale<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the valley of the Ure, which lies near the northern border of Yorkshire and flows eastward to unite with the Swale to form the Ouse.</note> very near to zero in my scale of worth. It is true their fields are fertile, their puddings savory; and if man were made of clay alone his powers would here be all fully exercised: but if we look for anything like understanding or enthusiasm, anything to exalt us above the mine of animal existence, we find a total and mournful blank. The general mind of those parts is a dead and tedious flat. Their ideas are all clothed in bacon and mashed beans. They live like the beasts that perish;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 49:12.</note> and their royal cheer but renders more disgusting the beggarly spirit which it gratifies. I love them not, and never felt so proud of Scotland as in their company. We feed not on their fat viands, we feel not their soft things; but we carry in our hearts a loftiness of purpose, a generous longing after greatness which ennobles all the <pb id="pg-01-283" n="01:283"/>humbleness of our condition, and sets us high above those beef-eaters as Heaven is high above the Earth. I have quarreled often with Scottish feeling, and still I disagree with much in its external aspect; but <hi rend="italic">what</hi> is there to venerate in Yorkshire? and who would not rather see old Knox&#x2019;s pulpit than the winning-post of Doncaster race-ground? You will tell me that I examined too little of the country or its inhabitants to speak so emphatically of their character. Indeed I am tired and wayworn, nor do I pretend to discuss the subject with philosophic calmness till some days have passed over me: but as for the people I saw enough of them and to spare. The principal of their unitarian college lamented in my presence the absurdities of Calvinism; the editors of the <hi rend="italic">Yawk Url</hi> (<hi rend="italic">York Herald</hi>)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Founded in <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>.

I was satiated with their conversation; and lest I satiate you all with my description of it, I leave the men of Yorkshire to their beef and their stupidity&#x2014;recommending them only to mercy when it shall please Providence to interfere in their behalf.</p>
<p>I know not whether I may again advert to the despondency which still overclouds your mind, and must render such gossiping, as I have indulged in, an exercise very alien to the current of your thoughts. I do not think you &#x201C;raving&#x201D;: I understand your feelings far better than you imagine. Few of us, my friend, get thro&#x2019; this vale of tears without looking forward at times in gloomy desire to the termination of its pains. One feels a stern delight in contemplating the narrow and everpeaceful bed of rest where the tumult and the pangs of life, &#x201C;the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to,&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, i.</note> shall never reach us more: but such feelings are unprofitable in their consequence, painful <pb id="pg-01-284" n="01:284"/>in their origin; you must not let them have dominion over you. The irresolution you complain of is a matter of regret rather than surprise; I know you will yet master it, and meet the conclusion with unaltered front, conscious that you have <hi rend="italic">deserved</hi> success&#x2014;and even if this (which I do not fear) should prove unattainable&#x2014;that you have gained a far higher reward in the approbation of your own mind and of all good men that know you. <hi rend="italic">The mirkest hour of night is next the dawn</hi>,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> as you once told me: let this be your rallying word; be steadfast and diligent; you cannot fail to recover from your losses.

<p><salute>My dear Fergus<supplied>[s]</supplied>on,&#x2014;</salute> I delayed writing to you chiefly for the old reason&#x2014;want of anything to say; and I have begun to write not because that want is at all sufficiently supplied, but because I would not vex your mind by unfounded suspicions that absence and oblivion are interchangeable terms in my vocabulary, or that the light of two months&#x2019; experience has shown me any flaws in your character to the prejudice of our wavering though agreeable correspondence. I prize the frankness of your procedure in writing a second time; there is so much of the counting-house in formal regularity, one likes to see a friend&#x2019;s letter sometimes want the &#x2018;I duly received your valuable favour, dated, and so forth.&#x2019; It is not my inclination to put your generosity often to such trials; but I promise you the present exercise of it shall not be thrown away.</p>
<p>The first letter, written late, appears also to have lingered long on the road. It reached me while in the heat of managing a small concern, which not long after called me into Yorkshire; and I wilfully delayed sending an answer, till, the affair being finally adjusted, I might have it in my power to communicate what seemed then likely <pb id="pg-01-285" n="01:285"/>to produce a considerable change in my stile of life. The matter I allude to was a proposal to become &#x2018;a travelling tutor,&#x2019; as they call it, to a young person in the North Riding, for whom that exercise was recommended, on account of bodily and mental weakness. They offered me &#xa3;150 per annum, and withal invited me to come and examine things on the spot, before engaging. I went, accordingly, and happy was it I went. From description, I was ready to accept the place; from inspection, all Earndale [Euredale?]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Almost certainly Uredale, which Carlyle could have spelled <hi rend="italic">Euredale</hi> in the text of the manuscript.</note> would not have hired me to accept it. This boy was a dotard, a semi-vegetable; the elder brother, head of the family, a two-legged animal without feathers, intellect, or virtue; and all the connections seemed to have the power of eating pudding, but no higher power. So I left the barbarous people&#x2014;kindly, however, because they used me kindly, and crossed the Sark,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A stream in Dumfriesshire flowing eleven miles south to the Solway Firth. The last seven miles are part of the Scottish border. &#x201C;A two-legged animal without feathers,&#x201D; from Swift&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">A Tale of a Tub</hi>, an expression attributed to Plato by Diogenes Laertius, appears later as a descendental symbol in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>.</note> with a higher respect for our own bleak fatherland than ever I had felt before. York is but a heap of bricks; Jonathan Dryasdust<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Ivanhoe</hi> is dedicated to the Rev. Dr. Dryasdust of York. He also occurs in <hi rend="italic">The Antiquary, The Fortunes of Nigel, Peveril of the Peak, Redgauntlet</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">The Betrothed</hi>. No doubt the original of Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;Dryasdust&#x201D; in many of his books.</note> (see &#x2018;Ivanhoe&#x2019;) is justly named. It was edifying to hear the principal of their Unitarian College<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Charles Wellbeloved (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), divinity tutor and director of Manchester College, York, from <date when="1803-00-00">1803</date> to <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>.</note> lament the prevalence of mysticism in religion; and as to their newspaper editor, though made of lead, he is lighter than McCullogh&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John McCulloch (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), editor of the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">20</date>, and contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>.</note> little finger. York is the Boeotia<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An agricultural region in Greece proverbial for the stupidity of its inhabitants.</note> of Britain; its inhabitants enjoy all sensual pleasures in perfection; they have not even the idea of any other. Upon the whole, however, I derived great amusement from my journey. I viewed a most rich and picturesque country. I conversed with all kinds of men, from graziers up to knights of the shire; argued with them all, and broke specimens from the souls (if any), which I retain within the museum of my cranium for your inspection at a future day.</p>
<p>It is scarce a week since I returned from this expedition; and now my plans must all be altered. If I come to Edinburgh, which seems <pb id="pg-01-286" n="01:286"/>likely, few manuscripts will accompany or follow me; no settled purpose will direct my conduct, and the next scene of this fever dream is likely to be as painful as the last. Expect no account of my prospects there, for I have no prospects that are worth the name. I am like a being thrown from another planet on this dark terrestrial ball, an alien, a pilgrim among its possessors; I have no share in their pursuits; and life is to me like a pathless, a waste, and howling wilderness&#x2014;surface barrenness, its verge enveloped under &#x2018;dark-brown shade.&#x2019;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A significant early expression of the Victorian &#x201C;waste land&#x201D; concept, described in full bleakness by Carlyle in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>.</note> Yet hope will sometimes visit me, and, at the worst, complaint is weak, and idle if it were not. After all, one has a desperate struggle&#x2014;and for what? For the bubble reputation,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">As You Like It</hi>, II, vii.</note> that we may fly alive through the mouths of men, and be thought happy, or learned, or great, by creatures as feeble and fleeting as ourselves. Sure it is a sorry recompense for so much bustle and vexation. Do not leave your situation, if you can possibly avoid it. Experience shows it to be a fearful thing to be swept on by the roaring surge of life, and then to float alone &#x2014;undirected on its restless, monstrous bosom. Keep ashore while yet you may; or, if you must to sea, sail under convoy; trust not the waves without a guide. You and I are but pinnaces or cockboats yet; hold fast by the Manilla ship; <hi rend="italic">do not let go</hi> the painter, however rough and grating.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fergusson went to Arbroath, Angus, the following year. A Manilla ship would be a large, safe one capable of sailing to the other side of the world.</note> I am sorry you are tired of anatomy, and such things. I am tired too, but that does not mend the matter. Yet trust the best; <foreign><hi rend="italic">nec deus intersit</hi></foreign> [let no god interfere]<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace, <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi>, l. 191.</note> is indeed true, naturally as well as poetically. Yet in spite of this, all things will and shall be well, if we believe aright. I designed to tell you a long tale about my most neglected studies, but I have no room. I have lived riotously with Schiller, Goethe, and the rest. <closer><salute>They are the greatest men at present with me,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>I am yours affectionately, /</salute></closer>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Had I acted with that punctuality, the want of which I am so ready to censure in others, you need not on this occasion have been put to the expense of postage in getting news of me. I did not think Farries would have been in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Wednesday&#x2014;or did not think so with the degree of assurance necessary for overcoming my indolence and previous engagements; for which reason I never visited his quarters till this morning&#x2014;and found to my astonishment and mortification that the &#x201C;way-faring man&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Jer. 9:2.</note> had vanished from our metropolis. The trunk was standing majestically on its left end beneath a shed; but Geordie had already travelled many hours. You will excuse my negligence, and not grudge your 8 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Payment by the recipient was the custom before the Penny Post was instituted in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>.</note> to avoid a greater evil, that of remaining in ignorance concerning my &#x201C;whereabout&#x201D; and my condition since we parted.</p>
<p>If Tuesday proved as bad southward of Erockstane<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ericstane or Ericstanbrae, a hill contiguous to the meeting point of Dumfries, Peebles, and Lanark shires, about five miles northwest of Moffat on the high road from Dumfries to Edinburgh.</note> as it did northward for many miles, you and the mares would be in a sorrowful condition. It rained upon us heavily from the time we approached the summit of that mountain, till we had arrived within twenty miles of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and one of my chief employments was picturing out the situation of poor Alick, <hi rend="italic">fronting</hi> the tempest from which I was lucky enough to be retiring. I cannot be at ease till I hear that you have arrived in safety.</p>
<p>My seat on the coach-roof was not <hi rend="italic">very</hi> uncomfortable tho&#x2019; the storm was so rough as soon to soak the lower part of my back, and completely to silence the loquacity of my fair fellow traveller. The cigars alas! were wet, they would not smoke; therefore out of spite I <hi rend="italic">ate</hi> the greater part of them. At Noblehouse<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A farm in Newlands parish, Peeblesshire, seventeen miles southwest of Edinburgh. At this time its posting establishment and inn were still notable. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18140618-TC-TM-01">TC to <sic>JJ</sic><corr>TM</corr>, <date when="1814-06-18">18 June 1814</date></ref>.</note> a passanger [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] had alighted, and I got inside&#x2014;for paying 2/ &#x2014;the rest of our journey. I <pb id="pg-01-288" n="01:288"/>listened with little attention and less delight to the conversation between two squires of low degree touching the various modes of breaking spaniels; and as the topics I attempted to introduce were shortlived and not to the taste of those hunters, it was a kind of relief in more than one sense to be fairly set down at last on the pavement of College-street, about half past four o&#x2019;clo<supplied>[c]</supplied>k. Waugh&#x2019;s residence was <hi rend="italic">found</hi> without difficulty; and the fat contented inmates receiving me very cordially, I soon forgot my weariness in large draughts of his indifferent tea. Waugh<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Waugh.</note> lives in a style as if Fortune smiled upon him. A fine room at 13/ per week, with all kinds of accom<supplied>[m]</supplied>odation, have a favourable aspect; and the alchemy by which Waugh extracts them from the expanse of an empty pocket is truly surprising. Hope never dies within the breast of man. <hi rend="italic">Make</hi> him but once a Doctor of Medicine, and Waugh sees nothing in the back-ground of coming days, but a splendid mansion in the west end of London town, a coach-and-four at times rattling along the pavement, and <hi rend="italic">fees</hi> descending to his now crane-necked purse&#x2014;&#x201C;thick as the leaves that strew the autumn brooks in Vallombrosa.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, I, 302&#x2013;4.</note> I lost a night&#x2019;s sleep and so almost threw myself into a low fever, in the vain endeavour to convince him that such projects being altogether baseless, he should keep hold of what property he has left, till some more rational way of spending it occur. Waugh is wedded to his idols, we must let him alone.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone&#x201D; (Hos. 4:17).</note></p>
<p>Next day I spent in seeking a place of abode. The rooms are still dear, and I had but the <foreign><hi rend="italic">out-weals</hi></foreign> [refuse] to choose among. Yet notwithstanding, I flatter myself with having made a fortunate selection. Mrs Duff&#x2019;s house was full, and the best room I could fix on every thing considered was this of Robertson in Carnegie-street. The parlour (for I have a snug bed-closet too) is not quite so warm as I could wish it indeed; but it is clean, well-aired, at the very out-skirts of the town; and the Landlady shapes to be among the best I have ever had. She is the widow of a Perthshire schoolmaster&#x2014;came to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at Whitsunday&#x2014;has no family but two little girls, and keeps no lodger but myself. The poor body <supplied>[d]</supplied>oes all she can to make me comfortable; and <supplied>[if]</supplied> once I w<supplied>[ere]</supplied> fairly fixed in my position, I doubt not she will succeed. A few days will try her better.</p>
<p>Except taking possession of my quarters&#x2014;hearing two lectures of the <pb id="pg-01-289" n="01:289"/>new Professor Wilson,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Wilson (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), this year appointed professor of moral philosophy at Edinburgh, and since <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date> a member of the editorial staff of <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi>. From <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> to <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date> he contributed to it parts of the <hi rend="italic">Noctes Ambrosianae</hi>, in which he figured as &#x201C;Christopher North.&#x201D;</note> and shaking hands with some few acquaintances, I have done nothing since my arrival. Brewster was not at home to-day, when I called and left the paper;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably one of the instalments of the Mohs paper. The fullest discussion of the &#x201C;projected review&#x201D; (which did &#x201C;fall to the ground&#x201D;) is to be found in an unpublished letter from Brewster to Carlyle. Dated <date when="1820-10-28">28 Oct.</date>, it reads in part: &#x201C;I have been maturing along with several other Gentlemen a scheme of a permanent nature in which I proposed that you should have an active share. This Scheme if it succeeds will be both creditable and Lucrative to you. I cannot say more of it till I see you personally, than that it relates to the establishment of a new Review in Edinburgh, which is at present a profound secret. The Review will not be political nor have any relation to Political Parties; but from the sentiments and characters of those already concerned in the Scheme, it must contain nothing but what is favourable to the Government of the Constitution both Civil &#x26; Ecclesiastical. The idea is that it shall have no direct Editor, but be managed by a Society of individuals; and I meant to propose that you should take the general charge under the Committee. &#x2026; Since I have written the preceding part of this letter I have had a conver<supplied>[sation]</supplied> with Messrs W. &#x26; C. Taits about the Review; and they seem much disposed to publish it. In the mean time do not mention it to any person.&#x201D;</note> so what is the state of his projected review, I cannot even conjecture. I should rejoice if it succeeded; but if it fall to the ground, as well it may, I certainly shall not fall with it. With health&#x2014;the care of which, you will be glad to learn, I mean to make a prime consideration&#x2014;I do not fear but I shall gain a living, and find finally that comfort and respectable competence which I have sought for so long in vain. Never be anxious for me, my boy; I hope to live to do you all good yet. There is nothing on all the Earth which I desire more: the affectionate attention, and patient endurance of my too fretful humour&#x2014;are indelibly engraven on my heart. Shall they go unrewarded? My dear B<supplied>[r]</supplied>other&#x2014;you must forgive my querulousness and tell my Mother and them all to forgive me. I have suffered more than they wot of&#x2014;or I should be inexcusable.&#x2014; But this will not do&#x2014; I forget that I have but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> sheet to work on and that fast drawing to a close. Write me often <hi rend="italic">very</hi> often and very long. Tell mine honest Jack to write from Annan<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle was now teaching mathematics at the Annan Academy and preparing for medical school.</note>&#x2014;all the rest every opportunity from home.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I sit down with the greatest pleasure to answer your most acceptable letter. I recollect last year the marked improvement which I used to notice in your composition and penmanship; but I confess I was not prepared for so elegant and forcible a style as your present epistle manifests. I say elegant and forcible for those epithets are without flattery applicable to it: you have only to persevere in correcting some few&#x2014;and they are now very few&#x2014;blemishes of orthography, the result of early inattention&#x2014;to treasure up the ideas that occur in your reading or intercourse with men, and to express those ideas with the liveliness natural to you, in order to become a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> letter-writer emphatically so called. But it was not the external qualities of your letter which yielded me most gratification: the warm affection the generous sympathy displayed in it go far nearer the heart; they shed over me a meek and kindly dew of brotherly love more refreshing than any but a wandering forlorn mortal can well imagine. Some of your expressions affect me almost to weakness&#x2014;I might say to pain, if I did not hope that the course of events will change our feelings from anxiety to congratulation&#x2014;from soothing adversity to adorning prosperity. I marked your disconsolate look; it has often since been painted in the mind&#x2019;s eye: but believe me, my boy, these days will pass over; we shall all get to rights in good time, and long after, cheer many a winter-evening by recalling such pensive but yet amiable and manly thoughts to our minds. And in the mean while let me utterly sweep away that vain fear of our ever forgetting one another. There is less danger of this than of anything. We Carlyles are a clannish people; because we have all something original in our formation, and find, therefore, less than common sympathy <pb id="pg-01-291" n="01:291"/>with others; so that we are constrained as it were to draw to one another, and to seek that friendship in our own blood which we do not find so readily elsewhere. Jack and I and you will respect one another to the end of our lives, because I predict that our conduct will be worthy of respect; and we will love one another, because the feelings of our young days&#x2014;feelings impressed most deeply on the young heart&#x2014;are all intertwined and united by the tenderest yet strongest ties of our nature. But independently of this your fear is vain: Continue to cultivate your abilities and to behave steadily and quietly as you have done; and neither of the two <hi rend="italic">literati</hi> are likely to find many persons more qualified to appreciate their feelings, than the farmer their brother.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander replied on <date when="1820-12-19">19 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;It is to me a task of no small importance scraping any-thing intelligable, not to say interesting, out of this rather stubborn, misguided and mis-improved intellect of mine.&#x2014;yet you would sooth<supplied>[e]</supplied> and please me by noticing the marked improvement I have made since last year; and without flattery, as you say, kindly bestow the proud epithets &#x2018;elegant and forciable&#x2019; on the rough style of my last <hi rend="italic">scrawl</hi>.&#x2014; I well know you could wish it so, and this fails not to act by way of spur to my perseverance and anxiety, to endeavour, steady attention to the marked road for my slow but determined improvement.&#x201D; Clearly, Alexander Carlyle felt his lack of education in comparison with his two brothers. Carlyle is right, however, in saying that it is mainly faults of spelling which disfigure his style, which is firm, clear, and vigorous.</note> Greek words, and Latin, are fine things; but they cannot hide the emptiness and lowness of many who employ them.</p>
<p>I could run on thus forever and a day; but more vulgar topics demand my attention. As to health, the most important question, I have not much to say. The <hi rend="italic">bowhills</hi> have been very restive since I came here; I have taken pills, castor-oil &#x26;c; but now by the help of those excellent cakes and with porridge to breakfast, but above all, with plenty of exercise, I hope to get quite round again. This is but a fit, a kind of quandary, occasioned by my confinement before leaving home, &#x26; by the untowardness of my out-going. Nothing &#x2018;special&#x2019; has yet transpired regarding the Review. The bookseller Tait seems very anxious about it, and has written to London for another brother<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Tait, partner with William in their bookselling concern.</note> of the trade to take a share in it, without which Tait dares not venture on the undertaking. Brewster has printed my article Hansteen; he is a pushing man and speaks encouragingly to me. Tait is loud in his kind anticipations of the grand things that are in store for me: but in fact, I do not lend much ear to those gentlemen; I feel quite sick of this drivelling state of painful idleness;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Pope, <hi rend="italic">The Dunciad</hi>, IV, 342.</note> I am going to be <hi rend="italic">patient</hi> no <pb id="pg-01-292" n="01:292"/>longer; but quitting study or leaving it in a secondary place, I feel <hi rend="italic">determined</hi> as it were to find something stationary&#x2014;some &#x2018;local habitation and some name&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream,</hi> V, i.</note> for myself ere it be long. I shall turn and try all things: be diligent be assiduous in season and out of season to effect this prudent purpose; and if health stay with me, I <hi rend="italic">still</hi> trust I shall succeed. At worst it is but narrowing my views to suit my means. I shall enter the <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> life, the mercantile, the lecturing, any life in short, but that of the country schoolmaster, and even that (sad refuge from the storms of fatel!)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pope&#x2019;s &#x201C;Prologue to Mr. Addison&#x2019;s Tragedy of Cato,&#x201D; 1. 21.</note> rather than stand here in frigid impotence&#x2014;the powers of my mind all festering and corroding each other, in the miserable strife of inward will against outward necessity. I lay out my heart before you, my boy, because it is solacing for me to do so: but I would not have you think me depressed. Bad health does indeed depress and undermine one more than all other calamities put together; but with care, which I have the best of all reasons for taking, I know this will in time get out of danger. Steady! then, steady! as the drill-sergeants say&#x2014; Let us be steady unto the end; in due time we shall reap if we faint not.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gal. 6:9.</note> Long may you continue to cherish the manly feelings which you express in conclusion; they lead to respectability at last from the world, and what is far better, to &#x2018;sunshine within&#x2019;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Pope, <hi rend="italic">An Essay on Man</hi>, IV, 168: &#x201C;The soul&#x2019;s calm sunshine, and the heartfelt joy.&#x201D;</note> which nothing can destroy or eclipse.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Expecting that Thursday morning would be arrived before Farries made his appearance here, I intended to set to work this night and write you a very full statement of all my doings since we parted: I am writing as you see on the night appointed; but with the prospect of the Porter&#x2019;s speedy appearance I must write hurriedly, and this circumstance will plead the excuse of my blunders in the present letter, and of my total failure in writing to my Father, which I am reluctantly compelled to postpone
till a fresh opportunity.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-293" n="01:293"/>My dear Mother, I should plead an apology of the most humble sort for the poor way in which alone I have hitherto been able to reward your truly maternal love and care of me. I know well and feel deeply that you entertain the most solicitous anxiety about my temporal and still more about my eternal welfare; as to the former of which, I have still hopes that all your tenderness will yet be repaid, and as to the latter&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it becomes not the human worm to boast&#x2014;I would fain persuade you not to harbour so many doubts. Your character and mine are far more similar than you imagine; and our opinions too, tho&#x2019; clothed in different garbs, are I well know still analogous at bottom. I respect your religious sentiments &#x26; honour you for feeling them, more than if you were the highest woman in the world without them. Be easy, I entreat you, on my account; the world will use me better than before, and if it should not,&#x2014;let us hope to meet in that <hi rend="italic">upper country</hi>, when the vain fever-dream of life is gone by, in the country where all darkness shall be light, and where the exercise of our affections shall not be thwarted by the infirmities of human nature any more.&#x2014; But I must not continue.</p>
<p>Our Review,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201123-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1820-11-23">23 Nov.</date></ref></note> you may partly hear, is still in a fluctuating state. Indeed to say truth, I place very little reliance on the scheme: but still it is not yet finally over till we hear from London: I shall know the issue next time I write. There seems little hope of getting anything to translate here at present&#x2014;and perhaps it is as well. Brewster will give me &#x2018;articles&#x2019; enough; but I am little in condition to write them at present. In a short space, however, I shall be quite well; and as (by Advocate Henderson&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. I. Henderson, called to the bar in <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>. The Advocates&#x2019; Library, founded <date when="1682-00-00">1682</date>, is now the National Library of Scotland.</note> means) I have now got admission to the Advocate&#x2019;s library&#x2014;I shall have good access to books&#x2014;if nothing better cast up. Meanwhile my living here is not to lose me any thing, at least for a season more or less. I have got two <hi rend="italic">hours</hi> of teaching (9 to 10 and 1 to 2) a few days ago, which both gives me a call to walk, and brings in 4 guineas a-month. I understand indeed they are not to continue many weeks but still they are serviceable in the meantime; and I have written to Mr Duncan to give me introduction to Gray of the High School, if he see fit,&#x2014;that so I may get more, and not expend my small money in the event of continuing here.&#x2014; I am dead stupid to-night&#x2014;so I fear you do not understand me well; but I shall write to Jack at Annan with greater fullness and leisure.&#x2014; I have <pb id="pg-01-294" n="01:294"/>already made a fearful attack upon the excellent cakes: you need not send any next time, I think; for the Landlady can bake them&#x2014;tho&#x2019; she admits not equally well. She is a mighty good lady, and were not her room <hi rend="italic">coldish</hi>, I should be quite fortunate in that respect. There is a room recommended to me far away&#x2014;beyond the town&#x2014;on the northside of it, where it is said I might have both country air and warmth with good attendance for the same sum. It is to be empty about New Year&#x2019;s day. Of course I can determine nothing yet. You shall hear all in due time.</p>
<p>But I must conclude for the present. Give my best love to my Father (with my foresaid excuse) and to all the sundry about Mainhill. Where are Mag and Mary that they do not write? And [The rest of the letter is missing.]</p>

<salute>My dear B<supplied>[r]</supplied>other Jack,</salute>
<p>I had no time last night to write a reply to your lively little note; and besides I gathered from some expressions <supplied>[in]</supplied> it that you intended to write me by the Annan carrier&#x2014;Richardson as I conjectured;&#x2014;for which reason I was the more willing to postpone the operation that so I might shoot two dogs with one ball, <hi rend="italic">Anglice</hi>, answer two letters at once. Richardson is here, and you have not written; nor considering the time, am I surprised at it. You will write to me next time, I know, at great length as to every thing that concerns you. Be free in stating all your doubts and queries and difficulties: I shall be as free in answering them.</p>
<p>It is very fortunate that you have got Fergusson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Someone (not Carlyle) has written David Fergusson on the outside of the letter. David Moncrieff Fergusson (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>), Annan schoolmaster, was a pupil with Carlyle at the academy. He wrote verse and published several works. He went insane in <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>.</note> to hear you a lesson; stick to it while you have such an opportunity; against winter you will be ready for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. I confess however that I feel a reluctance in advising you to diligence; because I know you are likely to be at least diligent <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>, and present appearances give me room to fear, not that you will become a sluggard, but that you will become a drudge&#x2014;and thus being ever more enticed by the charms of literature, <pb id="pg-01-295" n="01:295"/>and ever more repulsed by the <hi rend="italic">foreignness</hi> of every-day mortals, that, you will play the same miserable game that I have played, sacrificing both health and peace of mind to the vain shadows of ambition&#x2014;unattainable by one of us, and useless tho&#x2019; they were attainable. Therefore, my good boy, let me entreat you by the warmth of brotherly affection&#x2014;to beware of this, to guard against the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> advances of debility, to enjoy yourself in society by every honest means, and to regard it as a <hi rend="italic">certain fact</hi> that continuous study will waste away the very best constitution&#x2014;the loss of which is poorly, most poorly, recompensed by all the learning and philosophy of the human race. I fear you will not listen to me: young men feel flattered when it is said they are studying themselves into ill health; but they bitterly regret their conduct when it is too late. Believe my experience, my dear Jack; may it never become yours!</p>
<p>I have been led into these reflexions, because I am not yet quite recovered from a wicked rebellion of the intestines&#x2014;produced by the change of air, I suppose, and also by inclement circumstances in which that change was brought about.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is worth noting that the chronic ill-health which plagued Carlyle from <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date> on was probably less the result of over-work than of inadequate and bad diet, wrong medicines, cold, and lack of money to provide comfortable conditions.</note> I have studied none yet, and read next to none.

<salute>My dear Father,</salute>
<p>Having an opportunity (by Mr Foster of Corchess who has kindly waited on me) of writing you a few words, I embrace it gladly; because I am ignorant when Farries may return to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and also because I am afraid the rather low-spirited account you got of me the other week may have given you some uneasiness on my behalf&#x2014; An uneasiness which I am now happy to say would be quite superfluous. Since I wrote, the effects of my journey hither have been altogether or nearly altogether removed; and I feel now as well as I did before leaving Mainhill. Drugs of various kinds have contributed to this result; but chiefly abundant exercise, which I am determined to persist in, and this fine hard bracing frosty weather&#x2014;which nerves me all anew as it were.</p>
<p>I said last time that I had two hours of teaching; they still continue, and will do so I believe for a while. I get four guineas a month from them, and so <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> myself at least&#x2014;which is no despicable thing in the meanwhile. As to the Review it is still in a kind of half-existence tho&#x2019; I reckon it now almost in the dead-throes. I am to see Brewster in an hour, and hear about it. This is just about what I anticipated; and therefore I am not disappointed. But with regard to Translations&#x2014;I have in my eye a kind of project&#x2014;to send some <pb id="pg-01-297" n="01:297"/>specimens up to London, shortly, and see whether they will take. I cannot judge of the probabilities&#x2014; But I am resolved to try and try and <supplied>[not]</supplied> rest till I have fallen upon something feasible: And if it please the Fountain of all goodness to give me health of body, I doubt not I shall have force of mind to secure this desireable result.</p>
<p>You need not mind the money; I shall not want it for a good while at any rate.&#x2014; Irving &#x26;c send for me warmly to Glasgow during Christmas, I <supplied>[trust]</supplied> I shall go. They are most kind people.</p>
<p>Tell Alick to send me his ham<supplied>[, mut]</supplied>ton or bacon or whatever it is. I have been obliged to renounce porridge altogether; and I want a <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;bit o' good hem&#x2019;</hi> to eat in the morning. They may boil it.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I am going away to Glasgow tomorrow morning very early, and as Farries has not made his appearance this week, I conjecture that he will present himself in a day or two with a large bundle of letters from Mainhill: so that unless I bestir myself to-night <supplied>[you ru]</supplied>n the risk of failing to hear from me in ret<supplied>[urn. I]</supplied> am busied with many things indeed; but I <supplied>[must]</supplied> not disappoint you, and therefore I strain a point to exhibit some small sketch of my way of life since the last letter.</p>
<p>If Foster of Corchess did his duty <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, you must know by this date&#x2014;if he did it <hi rend="italic">at all</hi>, you will know on Sunday, that I am much better than when I wrote the last woful epistle. I was then rather unhappy: the wet journey and this vile smoky <hi rend="italic">mist</hi>, which is all the air we have to breathe here, produced an affect upon <supplied>[me]</supplied> of a very unpleasant kind. The case got wrong, the outward man, and then the inward man<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. II Cor. 4:16.</note> is sure to follow. But I walked, and swallowed drugs, and walked and swallowed drugs again, till things have come back to their old level. Not absolutely as well as one of you fortunate husbandmen&#x2014;who if it were but for the free breeze of heaven which you <pb id="pg-01-298" n="01:298"/>inhale, and which makes the pulse of life to play so cheerily within you, ought to reckon your lot happy in comparison with a sallow-faced city lordling: not so well as you, I say; but still well&#x2014;and hoping to be better. I have fallen upon a notable invention of late, whereby all the evils of writing are avoided, and what was once a noxious compression may become a salutary exercise. I write standing! It would do your heart good to see me placed upright like a <foreign><hi rend="italic">gear-powl</hi></foreign> [clothespole], over against a chair which I have exalted to the table and above which I have placed an old fir <supplied>[writin]</supplied>g desk of the landladys&#x2014;altogether forming an elevation of five feet odd inches. I stand plumb, almost; and yesterday I wrote seven hours without detriment&#x2014; But here comes the &#x2018;busy housewife&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gray&#x2019;s &#x201C;Elegy,&#x201D; 1. 22.</note> with tea and what not! So down goes my apparatus&#x2014;and I leave you for a season.&#x2014;</p>
<p>My dear boy, I have drunk that infusion, smoked a cigar, mounted the scaffolding, and here I stand again! Something I was talking about health&#x2014;but if I gossip on in this way, my sheet will be done presently, and you no whit the wiser. Therefore I become serious.</p>
<p>The Review about which I have prosed so often, is destined I think to die in the womb of its Mother. Our bookseller Tait wrote to London, you know, and got a&#x2014;refusal. Brewster then said in great dignity that he would go and see Oliver and Boyd<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Publishers, then of Baron Grants Close, Netherbow, who published Carlyle&#x2019;s translation, <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi>, in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>, when they were at Tweeddale Court, High Street, where they are now.</note> (now becoming great dealers) to consult about it. He went; they were from home; and here it rests. I called the other day; and the man would talk of nothing but two <hi rend="italic">cold Poles</hi> which he had discovered in the North,&#x2014;Poles of great intensity&#x2014;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">very</hi> interesting&#x2019; &#x2018;quite satisfactory&#x2019; and so forth. Then Jardine<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Jardine. Because he too was from Applegarth it seems likely he may have been related to Robert Jardine.</note> the engineer (of Millhouse-bridge) came in; and so they set forth <hi rend="italic">how</hi> canals were to be dug&#x2014;bogs drained&#x2014;coals found &#x26;c; and then went to communicate their speculations to the Royal Society of Physical science in this &#x2018;intellectual city.&#x2019; I am astonished to see this Doctor so flourishing a man. Except <hi rend="italic">activity</hi>, a kind of bustling shop-keeper activity, he has few mental qualifications that I can discover. More hope for me, the duller he is! In fact, I have little fear, when in health: I feel as if I could wrestle with the (strong) Skeleton Necessity<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Source not found. But see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210128-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1821-01-28">28 Jan. 1821</date></ref>.</note> and lay him on his back after all. Brewster has <pb id="pg-01-299" n="01:299"/><hi rend="italic">kneed</hi> him: it must be fair brute strength, if I bring him down at all. One other pull I have had&#x2014;in the shape of a project to translate Schiller&#x2019;s history of the Thirty years war&#x2014;a German book, of which I have just finished a specimen; and given it to Tait (above mentioned) who is to transmit the thing to Longman &#x26; Co. London.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Geschichte des Dreissigj&#xE4;hrigen Krieges</hi> (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1793-00-00">93</date>).

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>No doubt you are somewhat surprised and, it may be, a little anxious from the circumstance of your having received no letter or account of any kind by the last conveyance. I hasten to explain it all. By the <hi rend="italic">Fosterian</hi> letter, you would be made to perceive the probability of my journeying to Glasgow about Christmas, and thereby missing Geordie at the time of his appearance in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. It happened as <pb id="pg-01-300" n="01:300"/>you may have conjectured; Geordie came when I was flaunting it in the land of cotton and cold punch;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Glasgow.</note> so I did not get your kind note till half an hour ago; and a long letter, which I had prepared for you before setting out (on Saturday-week), was withheld from the bearer of yours&#x2014;a little ill-informed boy&#x2014;owing to an excess of caution, Celtic caution on the Landlady&#x2019;s part, and now lies waiting an opportunity of travelling to you cost-free, or if not, of lighting one of those special cigars which I owe to the renewed attention of the Burnswark Laird.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham.</note> Thus you see how it was, boy: I acted for the best, and tho&#x2019; it has proved but the best of a <hi rend="italic">bad job</hi>, I will not by delay make it worse, and so stand here driving an unwilling quill, to express the conceptions of a head yet whirling with the confused remembrance of steamboats, trackboats, goose-eating, prayer-meetings, and all the strange furniture of the Western City. Be indulgent to me then; and lug out your 8 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> with a good grace.</p>
<p>I see easily that the Black Dwarf and Old Mortality<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott&#x2019;s two novels, both published in <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>.</note> have hurried you rather, in your epistle; which however contains the gratifying intelligence&#x2014;still eminently gratifying tho&#x2019; happily it is common&#x2014;of your continued good health and peaceable situation. The times are hard, my man; and the hope of their improvement is still distant: but with a sound body and a free spirit, our life is not without its charms. We cannot indeed float about in gaudy enjoyment, as some do; we must fight with obstructions of a grating and painful nature; yet the hand of the industrious even now rarely fails, and the cultivation of our intellectual faculties, the cherishing a deep disdain of weak or wicked sentiments gilds over the humble elements of our destiny, it erects within the bosom of the poorest, a &#x2018;column of true majesty&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> which all his poverty but heightens by the contrast. Let us stand to our posts then: in due time we shall reap if we faint not.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gal. 6:9.</note></p>
<p>I am got better considerably, in point of health; so be not uneasy on that score. Health I feel to be the greatest of all earthly goods&#x2014;the basis of them all; and therefore I shall study the maintenance of it with primary care. I get low, very low, in spirits, when the clay house is out of repair; indeed I almost think at such times that health alone would make me happy; and in fact when strong outwardly, I seldom feel depressed within. This, you need not fear, will be a <pb id="pg-01-301" n="01:301"/>sufficient guarantee of my watchfulness: I shall &#x2018;think little and walk much&#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick&#x2019;s advice in his letter of <date when="1820-12-19">19 Dec.</date></note> in the fullest sense of the words. As to other matters, nothing definite has yet transpired. The Review I conceive is now reposing in the &#x2018;Limbo of vanity&#x2019;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, III, the &#x201C;Argument&#x201D; and 496&#x2013;97.</note> (let it go for a shallow phantom as it was!)&#x2014;and I have another project in the way of execution, of which whether it will prove better, I cannot pretend to say. I have translated a portion of Schiller&#x2019;s History of the thirty years war (it is all about Gustavus and the fellow-soldados of Dugald Dalgetty<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gustavus Adolphus (<date when="1594-00-00">1594</date>&#x2013;<date when="1632-00-00">1632</date>), King Gustavus II of Sweden. Dugald Dalgetty is a soldier of fortune in Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Legend of Montrose</hi>. For the translation, entitled &#x201C;Death of Gustavus Adolphus,&#x201D; see Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXV, 317&#x2013;20, discussed by G. B. Tennyson in &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Earliest German Translation,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">American Notes &#x26; Queries</hi>, III (<date when="1964-00-00">1964</date>), 51&#x2013;54.</note> your dearly-beloved friend); and sent it off, with a letter introduced by Tait the Review-bookseller, to Longman and Co London. Tait was to send it away very soon, in a package of newly published books, and to accompany it with a letter setting forth, that I was one of the most hopeful youths of the part, and that hence it were well for the men of Paternoster Row to secure my cooperation forthwith. The answer will come in (perhaps) 3 weeks. To say truth, my brother, I am not sanguine in this matter: But now is not the time to discuss it, both because my paper is waning, and because out of fatigue from travelling I might g<supplied>[ive]</supplied> you too dark a picture of that and all my other schemes. Let them rest with this; that all the malice of fortune<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">III Henry VI</hi>, IV, iii.</note> cannot take from me the merit of having intended honestly, and the strength to abide the very blackest of her scowls. And if my present associates seem worthless or disagre<supplied>[e]</supplied>able, let me reflect that I am not destitute of <hi rend="italic">friends</hi>, emphatically friends, tho&#x2019; few, and that seldom has a brother or a son been loved as I am.</p>
<p>Irving is a kind good fellow. He would have me come and spend some months with him, because he thought I felt uncomfortably here, and he had all the <foreign><hi rend="italic">sappy</hi></foreign> [generous] hospitality of Bailie Jarvie&#x2019;s<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Rob Roy</hi>.</note> children, at command. William Graham is also a friend and a deserving one: I could pass my time swimmingly among them: but I must work <hi rend="italic">with my own hands</hi>,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A phrase of Edward Irving&#x2019;s.</note> and work while it is called today. You cannot conceive what a week I have had. Fat contented merchants&#x2014;shovelling their beef over by the pound, and swilling <pb id="pg-01-302" n="01:302"/>their wine without measure, declaiming on politics and religion, joking and jeering and flowing and swaggering along with all their hfeart. I viewed them with a curious, often with a satisfied eye. But there is a time for all. Last night, I was listening to music and the voice of song amid dandy clerks and sparkling females&#x2014;laughing at times even to soreness at the marvellous Dr John Scott (see Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine);<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had been enjoying the sharp criticism Dr. John Scott (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>), editor of the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi>, had leveled at John Gibson Lockhart (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), at this time a contributor to <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi>, in the article &#x201C;Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine,&#x201D; which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi>, XI (<date when="1820-11-00">Nov. 1820</date>), 509&#x2013;21.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>It was not anger certainly that I felt, but it was a considerable disappointment and some degree of anxiety, at your long and, as it seemed, unaccountable silence. George<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The carrier, George Farries.</note> was therefore a welcome visitant to-day, when he brought me your kind and satisfactory epistle: and I have got upon my legs (for you must know I write standing), upon my legs as they say in the &#x2018;House o' Kimmins&#x2019; to answer it with great speed and cheerfulness. You must not be so tedious again; for in truth the letters I get from my kinsmen in Annandale constitute no small portion of the pleasure allotted me in this posture of my affairs; and you in particular being at the present time in the act of getting <pb id="pg-01-303" n="01:303"/>under way, as it were, to navigate the same ocean in which I myself am &#x2018;tempest-tost&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, I iii.</note>&#x2014;I feel a deeper interest in your situation and prospects, than when you were quietly moored to the plough-hills at Mainhill. In truth, my boy, I like your correspondence and Alick&#x2019;s more than any other I have access to. With hardly more than one exception you are to the full as intellectual as any of my letter-writers; and I know well that no one of them feels so profound and hearty a concern for my happiness. You will suspect my phrase &#x2018;intellectual&#x2019;; but I mean as I say. Your common student writes to me about Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine, shewing who wrote in it and who spoke of it; he talks about &#x2018;Kenilworth a Romance&#x2019;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott&#x2019;s novel had appeared that week.</note> he then describes his stomach-complaints, and wishes me better fortune, sometimes the dog even pities me. Now all this is very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wersh</hi></foreign> [insipid, tasteless]; there is no head in it, and for heart&#x2014;do I not see a hundred fold more in the honest, sturdy, Scottish sentiments with which the Philomath and his brother Husbandman<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John and Alexander Carlyle, respectively.</note> treat me in their honest epistles. Write often then I tell you and long; take no thought of what you say&#x2014;write any thing: I love to see the soul unveiled, and twenty oversights are not so bad as one affectation. Why not take your swing? and with a brother?</p>
<p>But if I take my swing long this way, my sheet will be done and you no whit the wiser in regard to the matters you so affectionately inquire about. The subject may be soon discussed however. Our Review is dead and gone: dead as mutton: so perish all vanities! Brewster took it to Tait and to Boyd; and it stunk in the nostrils of both. I have heard no word from London, and expect none for a week or so, about the translation I was proposing&#x2014;for which consult Alick: indeed I hardly think it will end in aught but inaction&#x2014;in disappointment, you see, it cannot, for I have set no hope upon it. Some other projects notwithstanding are dawning in my brain: one of them is to write an Essay (upon what?) and send it to Thomas Campbell<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>). Campbell was appointed in <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date> to edit the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi>, which appeared in its new series in <date when="1821-01-00">Jan. 1821</date>. See David Masson, <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Sketches and Memories</hi>, p. 292.</note> who has lately been appointed Editor of a Magazine in London: they pay well I am told and are fond of contributors. If he will not take it, then try something else; if nothing will please&#x2014;confound the knaves! I will write a <hi rend="italic">book</hi> and shame them all. But such projects&#x2014;even the Essay <pb id="pg-01-304" n="01:304"/>one&#x2014;require sound health and good spirits; while health and spirits are not alas! quite constantly afforded me at present. I am not unwell either; but this raw weather and this unsociable place operate upon me sometimes; and tho&#x2019; I feel that perhaps there is some stuff within me&#x2014;I feel also that there are doubts whether ever it will come out, and whether if it did, it would not be altogether worthless. This would be vain&#x2014;to any but you: let it pass for the outbreathing of an untried and somewhat dissatisfied mind, one who feels it painful to be idle and alone, and yet can find no fit employment or society. But Hope the Charmer lingers still behind! I feel and know, my boy Jack, that this mode of things will not last forever; that the flight of future days will be more joyful and serene; and then! all those years of drivelling and unrest being passed away&#x2014;how merrily we shall go frisking and chirping it along!</p>
<p>You do well to pursue your learning diligently yet in moderation. The path we tread on is full of thorns; but the very flowers of Paradise are mingled with them. Go forth then prosperously! Be constant, assiduous, prudent; you will not fail to earn the appropriate reward. I do not regret that you often see and talk with young persons of your own age and habits;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had written in his letter of <date when="1821-01-03">3 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;Far from studying with too much assiduity, I rather think that I trifle away my time in talking with such personages as D. Baxter and George Irving.&#x201D;</note> it is miserable to live alone, one gets envy and ill-will on hand, soreness and wasteness of hearth in prospect. You will do well with Ben;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ben Nelson (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), later described by Carlyle in an <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date> letter to Leigh Hunt as &#x201C;a worthy old-friend of mine &#x2026; an intelligent good man, Burgher of the little Scotch Town of Annan, whom I have known since my school days&#x201D; (Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH</hi>, p. 46). The town hall records of Annan list him as merchant (Norton, in <hi rend="italic">L26&#x2013;36</hi>, p. 129 n., says &#x201C;woolstapler&#x201D;) and as one who served as town councilor from <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date> to 
<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>. In a letter of <date when="1838-12-23">23 Dec. 1838</date>, Alick remarks that Nelson had recently been appointed agent for a branch of the Southern Bank of Scotland, Dumfries, but the records of that bank&#x2019;s ultimate successor, the Clydesdale Bank, Glasgow, contain no information on him. He was dynamic, dogmatic, at times vociferous, and manly. In the early years he was a great favorite of Carlyle&#x2019;s, but after Carlyle moved to London in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> he became more and more aware of Nelson&#x2019;s uncouth rusticity.</note> and when once you get to talk with him, there will be both profit and entertainment for you.&#x2014; Of course Fergusson<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Fergusson, mentioned in John&#x2019;s letter.</note> is a much better judge than I of your fitness for Virgil: if he be right, you have done excellently&#x2014; Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> for you next year! I shall send the Virgil by Geordie (first opportunity); and you can try it&#x2014;if you like. Do you get any other reading?

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have had such a days running &#x26; perplexity, I waited so long for your letter, and I feel so stupid after getting it, that actually you must not look for any thing but most insipid drivelling from me on this occasion. I saw Parliament<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. George Little, a surgeon of Ecclefechan whose father George Little, a farmer, lived in Parliament Close, Ecclefechan.</note> yesternight, and then Farries, who told me he had a box, which would be with me next morning early; whereas after waiting till 11 o&#x2019;clock this morning, I had to search out <pb id="pg-01-306" n="01:306"/>who knows how many Carriers&#x2019; stores, to travel back and travel forward&#x2014;to consult with hostlers and chaffer with porters and assign the waffler fifty times to &#x2018;all the devils&#x2019;&#x2014;before I could get sight of that unfortunate hamper. And the whole of this to happen just when I was meditating a change of lodgings, and so had need of all my wits and all my time to use them undisturbed! The Waffler is a <hi rend="italic">waffler</hi> still.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A minister in the Middlebie pulpit was attempting to preach upon these words: &#x2018;He that is unholy, let him be unholy still.&#x2019; The poor man as you know perhaps could do nothing but repeat and repeat the verse, <hi rend="italic">He that is un</hi>, &#x26;c, having totally forgotten the beginning of his sermon. An upland Proprietor listened to him with increasing impatience, reiterating the words; till at length another <hi rend="italic">he that is unholy</hi> drove the worthy Laird out of all composure; he started up, squeezed on his hat, and stalked gruffly along the passage muttering: &#x2018;He that is a confounded Jackass, let him be a Jackass still!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-02/lt-18231220-TC-JJ-01">TC to JJ, <date when="1823-12-20">20 Dec. 1823</date></ref>).</note></p>
<p>I have not got a new room; and still feel undetermined about quitting the present one. My Landlady is good, no need of better; but the place is <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>, visited too freely by the breath of Heaven, and other &#x2018;skiey influences&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Measure for Measure</hi>, III, i. For &#x201C;the breath of Heaven,&#x201D; see William Cowper&#x2019;s &#x201C;Human Frailty,&#x201D; l. 23.</note> to which my carcase has no liking. I thought once of going to a place called Warriston Crescent, on the nort<supplied>[h]</supplied> side of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, where one Moon a preacher has resided several years; but on visiting the spot to-day, I find that &#x2018;gliding remote in the verge of the sky the <hi rend="italic">Moon</hi>&#x2019; still lingers in that chamber, to the exclusion of all other bodies. I know of some places in the neighbourhood; but this poor Mrs Robertson is so worthy a creature that I would fain weather out the winter with her. Direct to me as if nothing had been said on this score: if I depart, notice will be left whither I am gone.</p>
<p>My possessions of worldly comfort are still mostly in <hi rend="italic">perspective</hi>. Yet I live in hope, and no sooner is once <supplied>[one]</supplied> scheme blasted than another springs up instead of it. Brewster is to settle with me about my <hi rend="italic">writings</hi> whenever I like to go over; and what <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be better he professes great readiness to furnish me with a letter of introduction to Thomas Campbell, who has lately been appointed Editor of a Magazine in London,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi>.</note> the publishers of which are said to offer about fifteen guineas a sheet. I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> try somewhat for Campbell. O for one day of such vigorous health and such elastic spirits as I have had of old! I will try however. Brewster came to me on the street to-day, and talked long: he seems to feel that I can be of some use to him, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> he treats me gently. I was at dinner with him the other day; and <pb id="pg-01-307" n="01:307"/><hi rend="italic">there</hi> were Professor Wallis, Telford the engineer,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Almost certainly William Wallace (<date when="1768-00-00">1768</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), professor of mathematics since <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date> at Edinburgh and a contributor to Brewster&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</hi>. Carlyle was familiar with Wallace (which is in keeping with the casual way he mentions him here), had spoken of him in earlier letters, and had spelled his name correctly each time. Thomas Telford (<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), the civil engineer, born in Dumfriesshire, is mainly remembered for the Menai Straits Suspension Bridge and the Caledonian Canal, although also a minor poet.</note> Jardine another of the same, and one Wright a very ugly loud-speaking man. They are persons to hear whom would make one admire how they have got the name and the emolument they enjoy at present. Telford spoke of his &#x2018;friend&#x2019; the duke of this, and his friend the Marquis of that&#x2014;all honourable men. I left the party without regret to sup with little Murray (you recollect about him), where was to appear M'Diarmid of Dumfries and M'Culloch, the great M'Culloch better known to you as the &#x2018;Scotsman&#x2019;.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M'Diarmid (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>), editor (in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date> owner) of the Dumfries and Galloway <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>. He also edited Cowper&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>) and Goldsmith&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Vicar of Wakefield</hi> (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>). John Ramsay McCulloch (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), the political economist, edited the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> from <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date> to <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>.</note> M'Culloch fell sick, and we had to content ourselves with one of his coadjutors&#x2014;a broad-faced, jolly, speculating, muddleheaded person called Ritchie.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Ritchie (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>), one of the founders of the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>. He became its owner shortly after <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>.</note> I debated with Ritchie in a very desultory stile about poetry and politics, less to his edification than surprise; and the dapper little M'Diarmid sat by as umpire of the strife. M'Diarmid is not &#x2018;an elegant gentleman&#x2019;; his look recalled to me the Yorkshire Mooncalf:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An allusion to the young man offered to Carlyle as a private pupil by Dr. Allen. Cf. <hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi>, II, ii.</note> in mental qualities he is estimable rather than otherwise&#x2014;shewy but unsubstantial&#x2014;broad but shallow. &#x2018;What a <hi rend="italic">grawsp</hi>&#x2019; said he after repeating some lines of Byron&#x2014; &#x2018;G-d! What a <hi rend="italic">grawsp</hi>!&#x2019; said he, pursing his mouth to a side&#x2014;learing with his drowsy eyes and shovelling out his <hi rend="italic">wee</hi> hand&#x2014;as if to catch the rumbottle&#x2014; &#x2018;G-d what a <hi rend="italic">grawsp</hi>!!&#x2019;</p>
<p>After all perhaps I shall fall into some agre<supplied>[e]</supplied>able society here, and finally be restored to something like steady peace and comfort. In the mean time, as you remark, I ought to be thankful that I am as I am. Witness Waugh!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Waugh.</note> sad emblem of imprudence! Hunted by duns, destitute of cash, he has left his luggage to make good the payment of his lodging, and is now winding his zig-zag way among the pursebearers of Annandale to raise a little money from the wreck of his property. No one but pities Waugh, no one but blames him.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho' I believe I was the last active party in this our correspondence, yet hearing your wish that I should write again, and having a few minutes time to app<supplied>[l]</supplied>y as suits me, you see I am so dutiful a son, that I apply it solely to gratify you in this point. In truth it requires no great effort to apply it so; for I am always glad when I have the means of writing to you as I am doubly glad when I have the chance to hear from you. There is nothing attractive in my history indeed; but it is gratifying every way to unfold myself before one to whom I am bound by so many titles of gratitude and respect even if the &#x2018;link of Nature&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, IX, 14.</note> did not bind me, and who I am aware would reckon few occurrences happier than one that would restore me to happiness and health such as in the &#x2018;blooming-time of life&#x2019; they are wont to be enjoyed. I am afraid, however, that you take my case too deeply to heart. It is true, I am toiling on the waves, and my vessel looks but like a light canoe; yet surely the harbour is before me, and in soberness when I compare my tackle with that of others, I cannot doubt hardly that I shall get within the pier at last. Without figure, I am not a genius, but a rather sharp youth, discontented and partly mismanaged, ready to work at aught but teaching, and to be satisfied with the ordinary recompense of every honest son of Adam, food and raiment and common respectability. Can I fail to get them if I continue steadfast? No I cannot fail. The way, indeed, is weary, it leads thro&#x2019; <pb id="pg-01-309" n="01:309"/>a dry parched land wherein few waters be; but how happy is it that I journey unattended by Remorse!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi>, III, i. For &#x201C;dry parched land&#x201D; see cf. Ps. 63:1.</note> that my conscience, tho&#x2019; it wound, does not sting me; that my heart, when it faints, does not condemn! I ought to be grateful that it is so; and to bear those &#x2018;light afflictions&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >II Cor. 4:17.</note> calmly&#x2014;they are not sent without need.</p>
<p>You observe, Mother, I talk about my own affairs most fluently: yet there are other affairs about which I am any thing rather than indifferent. It will be changing the direction more than the nature of my thoughts (for this also is one of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> concerns) if I enquire particularly into your situation at Mainhill. <hi rend="italic">How</hi> are you? Tell me largely when you write. I fear your health is feeble: I conjure you be careful of it. Do you get tea&#x2014; the weary tea&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">alone</hi> now? By the little table <foreign><hi rend="italic">ben</hi></foreign> [at the back of, in the back room of] the house? I advise you to use it frequently: it is excellent for weak stomachs. And do not, I entreat you, let any considerations of thrift or such things restrain you in those cases. None of us is rich; but we should certainly be poor indeed, if among us&#x2014;we could not muster enough for such a purpose. Keep yourself from cold most careful<supplied>[ly]</supplied> this unhealthy season, and read the &#x2018;worthies&#x2019; any thing that will satisfy that high enthusiasm of your mind, which, however you may disbelieve it, is quite of a piece with my own. Do you still get the Repository?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Christian Repository and Religious Register</hi>, the organ of the Burghers. In <date when="1821-01-00">January</date> of this year it united with the <hi rend="italic">Christian Magazine</hi>, the organ of the Antiburghers, and was published (in Edinburgh, not Glasgow) &#x201C;by Ministers of the United Secession Church&#x201D; under the title of the <hi rend="italic">Christian Monitor and Religious Register</hi>. Its name was changed in <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date> to the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Theological Magazine</hi>, and frequently changed thereafter until it ceased publication in <date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>.

<p><closer><salute>But here I must end. A happy new-year to you, my dear Mother, and many many of them&#x2014;to be a blessing to us all!&#x2014; Write to me next time in the most ample manner. My best love to all the children.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It was one of the expectations awakened by your last letter that the debt I am now paying would have been more agre<supplied>[e]</supplied>ably discharged by &#x2018;oral communication&#x2019; during your projected visit to this our northern city. Why did you not come at Christmas? Why not go with me to Glasgow and see all the spinning-mills and Lunatic Asylums and preachers and philosophers of the famous West? Examine your head, I pray you; and if you do not find a great (temporary) depression in the organ of Will&#x2014;then burn your Spurzheim and throw your stucco model into the deepest pool of Ouse.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Yorkshire river joining the Trent to form the Humber.</note> Seriously you should have come: Irving would have felt as he ought on the occasion; and Dury or Drury or whatever his name is&#x2014;your correspondent and fellow labourer&#x2014;bade me tell you that all kinds of accom<supplied>[m]</supplied>odation were in readiness for you whenever you pleased to honour him with using them. Is the M.D. quite vanished though? I am still here, and would be happy to see you.</p>
<p>I called this letter a debt or rather the discharge of one, intimating thereby that I was to entertain you with some friendly communication in return for your last favour. It is fair to confess however that my diligence on this point has been quickened by different considerations; and I grieve to say that but for a certain boon, which I have now to ask of you, perhaps I might yet a little while have yielded to the calls of laziness or ill-health; and you would not now have been perusing my effusions. Yet be patient; for I will pay you all to the uttermost farthing in due season: meanwhile I beg of you to consider this letter as a mere plain matter-of-fact, business one; and to answer it with all the despatch and prosaic fidelity proper in such cases.</p>
<p>The boon I have to ask is this. You asked me lately if I &#x2018;would really take your secretary&#x2019;s place?&#x2019; And tho&#x2019; I felt all the kindness implied in this question; and tho&#x2019; my prospects here are not the most brilliant, my situation not the most comfortable; I should not have experienced <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much hesitation in answering No. Literature is like money, the appetite encreases by gratification: the mines of literature too are unwholesome and dreary as the mines of Potosi; yet from either there is no return&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; little confident of finding contentment&#x2014;happiness <pb id="pg-01-311" n="01:311"/>is too proud a term&#x2014;I must work, I believe, in those damp caverns&#x2014;till once the whole mind is recast or the lamp of life has ceased to burn within it. I cannot come to York then in my present humour: but for all that like a true grasping greedy Scot, I am not going to let your offer pass me altogether without effect. There is a young man<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably George Johnston, brother of James, who graduated in medicine in <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>. Carlyle was seeing something of him at this time (see his letters to John A. Carlyle). He must not have got the post, as he gives a full account of his search for employment in a letter to Carlyle of <date when="1822-05-02">2 May 1822</date>. He settled at Marsden, where Carlyle visited him in <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date> (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, I, 380). See also <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250321-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1825-03-21">21 March 1825</date></ref>.</note> now beside me, about to gain a Surgeons diploma, for <supplied>[whom]</supplied> I feel anxious on every account, that what of your interest is unengaged might be exerted in this matter. I am ignorant entirely about the thing, I know not how the office is to be filled, I know not even if it is vacant; and therefore I need not trouble you with a long description of this young man&#x2019;s many excellent qualities. It will be enough to observe that he writes a very superior hand, has shewn great diligence and perseverance in the discharge of all his duties hitherto, and can produce the most unequivocal testimonials of a pure moral character. I may add for your own private information, that in the event of his coming to fill the situation, you would find much entertainment and gratification in his company, which from the modest intelligent and upright character of the man as well as from the general nature of his pursuits, I think you could not fail to relish highly. He is about two and twenty years of age; &#x2018;has sailed upon the dark blue sea&#x2019;; speculated on physiology and religion, studied medicine (as I have hinted) and read very miscellaneously.</p>
<p>Now if you can do any thing in this matter, I sh<supplied>[all take]</supplied> the <supplied>[liberty]</supplied> of requesting you for my sake to do it with all <supplied>[your]</supplied> might. <supplied>[I]</supplied> feel much interest in this young man, much respect for him, and much sympathy with his widowed and most meritorious Mother. It was I that proposed making this application too; and tho&#x2019; this is nothing, it ought to be mentioned for the sake of justice.&#x2014; If you cannot move in this project, I beg you will let us know <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>: indeed I must beg to hear from you immediately whatever be the state of affairs&#x2014;some arrangements depend on your answer which cannot be neglected even a few days without inconvenience&#x2014;not a week without very great and permanent detriment. I expect your answer then by return of post.</p>
<p>Does this dull intrusive memorial need apology? I have none to <pb id="pg-01-312" n="01:312"/>give but the innocence of my own wishes, and the compliment I have paid you in supposing that it would yield pleasure to your mind to forward the views of a young man deserving your most active patronage&#x2014;even tho&#x2019; he were not the friend of your friend. You must write then, fully, explicitly, by the <hi rend="italic">very first</hi> opportunity.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Tho' circumstances, I daresay of a very pressing nature, have prevented you from writing to me by the opportunity of George&#x2019;s box<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Dalgliesh, a law student (&#x201C;jurisconsult&#x201D;) evidently had a box that regularly traveled to and from Annan.</note>; I comfort myself with the hope that you are going on as usual to exercise your pedagogic functions, and augment your acquaintance with Latin and other scholar-like attainments. The indefatigable jurisconsult&#x2014;to whose visit this day you are indebted for my present effusion&#x2014;complains sorrowfully that you have not sent him any letter, and bids me renew the request or stipulation he already made with you in regard to that matter. I am not friendly to long-winded epistles especially when destitute of meaning; and I think a young person may easily find better employment than scribbling the clack of a little burgh or speculating on the history of its most slender and obscure inhabitants: but at the same time, I have found by experience that there is such a thing as too exclusive a devotion to reading; and a command of the pen, not to be acquired without practice, is often a more saleable acquisition than large stores of knowledge, which remain locked up within our own heads and incapable of being exhibited in a permanent shape. Besides, man, you cannot live by books alone. You have a heart as well as a head; and that heart has little trifling desires after sociality and merry communication&#x2014;which it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> have gratified, or <pb id="pg-01-313" n="01:313"/>else make you smart for it. Write then to this poor boy&#x2014;if you think it worth while&#x2014;as short a letter as you like. To me, you know, your letters are always welcome visitants: and I give you a standing commission to write me concerning all your affairs, your studies, feelings difficulties delights&#x2014;certain of ever finding an affectionate listener, and if not an experienced, at least a warm and honest adviser. Yet let not my correspondence be a task to you: write only when you can conveniently write; but on those occasions, give the slip to reserve and punctilio; put down whatever you <hi rend="italic">feel</hi>, in whatever shape you feel it, shew me your <hi rend="italic">winnow-cloth</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A cloth for separating the grain from the chaff.</note> fearlessly. If not to your brother, to whom can you unbosom freely?</p>
<p>I trust you get forward with Caesar. Do you follow his narrative on any map? Have you the use of a Lempriere?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Lempri&#xE8;re (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>) published his <hi rend="italic">Classical Dictionary</hi> in <date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>.</note> I wish you had mine: but I think I left Aadan<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The name appears to be spelled so, but Carlyle must have meant Alexander Adam (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>), whose <hi rend="italic">Roman Antiquities</hi> was published in <date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>.</note> Roman Antiquities, which if you diligently consult it, will go near to compensate for the want of Lempriere in many respects. One general advice I have often given you and now repeat: it is to <hi rend="italic">let nothing pass uncomprehended</hi>; the practice may detain you sometimes, but it is the <hi rend="italic">shortest</hi> mode at the long run. I would have sent the Virgil, but Fergusson has not brought it back. You shall get it, if possible, by Farries.&#x2014; Go on! my brave boy, and prosper! After all this literature is a grand and glorious thing. It is the life-blood of the mind; and mind is the sovereign of Nature. Kings <supplied>[who]</supplied> have it not go down to dust and are forgotten; <supplied>[those]</supplied> who <supplied>[have]</supplied> it influence the world, and spread their own brief <supplied>[thinki]</supplied>ng over many generations of their fellow men. Go on then to improve! And yet for God&#x2019;s sake be careful of your health! You know not what a jewel, how inestimable a thing it is, you will never know I trust.</p>
<p>For my own affairs, I have nothing important to say. The date of this sheet will inform you that I have changed lodgings: I am soon to change again I expect&#x2014;to a spot called Warriston Place on the north side of the new town&#x2014;where I shall enjoy better air and better attentions, the landlady being strongly recommended to me. This raw open weather is against me somewhat; and bodily disorder&#x2014;embodied now in a most refractory state of the digestive process&#x2014;cramp my exertions and almost entirely forbid study. In a little time, I hope to be quite stout. If spring were come, I am going to bathe in the Forth <pb id="pg-01-314" n="01:314"/>&#x26;c &#x26;c. The Hibernian pupil has never returned since Christmas. I shall enquire about the slut<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murphy, the Irishman. A Scots word <hi rend="italic">slute</hi> means &#x201C;lazy fellow.&#x201D;</note> one of those days.

<p>Give my heart&#x2019;s love to all at Mainhill: and write me liberally whenever you have an opportunity.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>The other afternoon, after finishing my dinner, I had reclined me in a reposing posture upon three chairs (for I always love to lie well), and was beginning to forget my own thoughts in contemplating the pomp and circumstance of Wallenstein&#x2019;s camp at Pilsen in Bohemia, reflected to my imagination from the imagination of our friend Schiller,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Schiller&#x2019;s dramatic trilogy <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi> was published from <date when="1796-00-00">1796</date> to <date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>.</note> when suddenly a rap was heard at the room-door, and after due formalities, there was ushered in a rusty-looking man with a letter in one hand and a most substantial dread-nought in the other. I started up and eyed this person with astonishment and apprehension. &#x201C;Mr. Johnston&#x2019;s compliments,&#x201D; said the apparition&#x2014;&#x201C;very sorry he could not come himself.&#x201D; My astonishment increased; and it was not without much cross-questioning, that by the help of great natural sagacity I contrived to unfold this riddle, and learn to whom I stood indebted for so curious a present.</p>
<p>When the messenger was gone and I had leisure to peruse your letter, I knew not whether to laugh or cry. Really, Sir, you must be a very considerate gentleman. Not only, it seems, am I to owe you all kinds of accommodation for mind and body, when at Glasgow; but distance and absence are to offer no obstruction to the exercise of <pb id="pg-01-315" n="01:315"/>your benevolent attentions. This disposition is to me a sort of novelty in human character, and would deserve admiration for its very scarceness, if it were for nothing else. As to the <foreign>roguelauve</foreign>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The dreadnought. The word should be <hi rend="italic">roquelaure</hi> (the Scots form being <hi rend="italic">rokelay</hi>), a French word for a kind of outer mantle.</note> there is something in the sending of it so <hi rend="italic">fatherly</hi>, so home-like&#x2014;dashed with a tinge of the ludicrous which makes it more home-like,&#x2014;that I declare I feel most agreeably titil<supplied>[l]</supplied>ated every time I look at it. On cold nights, I wrap myself up within its ample folds, and whilst I stalk along the streets&#x2014;deserted by all but sons of Belial and hypochondriacs like myself&#x2014;not only does the outward man acknowledge this genial shelter, but the soul seems as if she too were sheltered, wrapt up in the mantle of soft affections&#x2014;as if she were not quite an alien in the world after all.</p>
<p>I need not say how much your letter gratifies me. It recalls the memory of a scene, where I experienced nothing but pleasure, and which naturally rises on the mind in colours of freshness and warmth. The jolly west is full before me. Everyone will praise the fair, of course, as his own market has gone in it: and so in spite of all that small dapper jurists and other waiting gentlewomen can say to the contrary, I shall still continue to assert the worth of your city, and the superiority of her solid house-wife qualities to those of her lean, prim, mincing, more ambitious neighbours. Dr. Scott<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. John Scott.</note> himself is to me a richer feast than all the addle-pated sages of our Royal society. Still more is the reflected relish of your &#x201C;most magnanimous goose&#x201D; dear to me, enjoyed as it was at first hand by Longshanks<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving. In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1821-01-20">20 Jan.</date>, Graham had used this nickname for Irving and told how he, Irving, and the William Johnstons of the Grange, about eight miles from Ecclefechan, had feasted upon &#x201C;a most magnanimous goose.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250902-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1825-09-02">2 Sept. 1825</date></ref>.</note> and others whom I love so well. You would have a joyful evening doubtless; and I trust that many such are yet in store for all of us.</p>
<p>Apparently you forgot that I was become so exceedingly thin skinned of late, so sensible to all sorts of praise and blame; or you would not have risked intoxicating me with so many flattering encomiums as you have drawn from your own kind fancy or transmitted from the kind fancies of others. I suspected what the French call <hi rend="italic">mystification</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Trickery, or being teased.</note> when you talked to me of poetry and Byron. Alas! my dear Sir, if discontented thoughts and reckless familiarity with whatever is at first sight more appalling in our inexplicable destiny, <pb id="pg-01-316" n="01:316"/>were all that went to form Giaours and Childe Harolds, there would indeed be a plentiful supply of that commodity. The corroding strife of will against Necessity, the vain tho&#x2019; desperate efforts we make to reconcile the world within and the world without, are not confined to Byron: thousands feel this deeply; but the magic voice that gives it utterance, and clothes it all with splendour and beauty are the lot of one or two. I might write &#x201C;last speeches&#x201D; and &#x201C;dying words&#x201D;: poetry&#x2014;alas!&#x2014;upon the whole, I do not regret this deficiency. Poets such as Byron and Rousseau are like opium eaters; they raise their minds by brooding over and embellishing their sufferings, from one degree of fervid exaltation and dreamy greatness to another, till at length they run <hi rend="italic">amuck</hi> entirely, and whoever meets them would do well to run them thro&#x2019; the body. Peace to the unfortunates! They find repose at last.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s attitude toward Byron is more complex than this passage or his later &#x201C;Close thy Byron; open thy Goethe&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> would suggest. See C. R. Sanders, &#x201C;The Byron Closed in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Studies in Romanticism</hi>, III (<date when="1964-00-00">Winter 1964</date>), 77&#x2013;108. Graham had suggested that Carlyle try writing poetry in competition with Byron.</note></p>
<p>You are right in supposing that I sympathize with your disappointment.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200915-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1820-09-15">15 Sept. 1820</date></ref>.</note> I did indeed regret to learn that the negotiation at Manchester had proved abortive. This must disgust and perplex you sure enough; yet even now I will not permit you for a moment to despond. New Holland with a vengeance! Are not men reasoning self-interested animals! Let but the cotton sellers have time to get their irritation cooled and to see the obvious <hi rend="italic">advantages</hi> of your proposal, and they must accede to it: or if they still continue obstinate, and drive you to extremity; can their stupid conduct rob you of all? I entreat you to look around and observe what a place you have gained in the minds of your Glasgow brethren; and then to think if a <hi rend="italic">name</hi> can expel you from it. Be of good cheer: for tho&#x2019; it is night with you and me at present (the greater pity&#x2014;two such honest fellows!); yet wait a little and the sickly dews, the spectres wan and birds of boding cry will vanish from the scene, as&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I cannot tell you what a pleasure it is for me to read over all your letters on the happy morning when Farries completes his sluggish journey. In idea, I am carried back far to the south; and see you all seated round the ingle&#x2014;surrounded with bustle it is true (for what is life anywhere but bustle?]&#x2014;yet cheered with honest healthy thought and merrily bearing your burdens across the bogs and wastes of this our labyrinthine wandering course. I sympathise with your particular difficulties, which I know well enough to be hard and at times ill to bear; yet I know you have <hi rend="italic">bottom</hi> in you sufficient to endure them all without wavering, conscious that brighter days are coming: and if you have not much leisure for intellectual improvement, it ought to be your consolation that a far higher species of improvement, the improvement of the heart, is at all times within our reach, that it follows us to the field and to the closet thro&#x2019; the hourly business of our life and cannot indeed be carried on otherwise than by struggling with the untoward elements of our situation. Labour and anxiety are the lot of some, idleness or pleasure (as they think it) and black inquietude <pb id="pg-01-318" n="01:318"/>of others; each man has his task, and the peasant who performs it well, how proudly does he stand above the satraps of the Earth who perform it ill! Let not your mind be ruffled then; keep it calm, and subdue its wrong propensities&#x2014;its little frettings and longings after forbidden things; till at length by patient waiting and improving all advantages, the hour come that shall satisfy all your honourable wants. The way to it is hard and thorny, I know it well: but diligent endeavour will vanquish every obstacle, &#x26; then&#x2014;! I tell you, boy, that good times <hi rend="italic">are</hi> in store for all of us: let us wait for them with stedfastness, and whatever happen still say with better reason than the Poet,</p>
<lg><l>Here&#x2019;s a <hi rend="italic">sigh</hi> to those that love us,</l>
<l>And a <hi rend="italic">smile</hi> to those that hate;</l>
<l>And whatever sky&#x2019;s above us,</l>
<l>Here&#x2019;s a heart for every fate.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Byron&#x2019;s poem to Thomas Moore: &#x201C;My Boat Is on the Shore,&#x201D; ll. 5&#x2013;8.</note></l></lg>
<p>By the date of this, you will discover that I have returned to my old abode. I migrated, as Jack may have told you, to a place called Arthur-street in this neighbourhood&#x2014;for the sake of warmth, having <hi rend="italic">no</hi> fault to this place except a deficiency in that particular: but a few days&#x2019; residence in my new quarters soon taught me that warmth was not the only or the most important requisite for comfort. A little tawdry affected <foreign><hi rend="italic">kimmiter</hi></foreign> [weasel] was my sole attendant in Arthur-street; the <hi rend="italic">mistress</hi> never saw me; the air too was smoky as the mouth of Vesuvius; and the street was full of wh&#x2014;res. So I told the creatures that I was going to march, and as Moon made difficulties about the period of his leaving Warriston and the weather was becoming warmer, I bethought me of the excellent qualities of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> valuable Celt (from whom I had parted on the kindest terms), and returned to her last Saturday. She is <foreign><hi rend="italic">kedgie</hi></foreign> [eagerly friendly] (as the Yankies and you say) very kedgie about me; and I design to continue with her henceforth. The cold is not troublesome hardly: and to guard against it, I am now provided with a huge tartan cloak, a dreadnought as we call it, which I lately got from Glasgow. Graham (honest soul!) sent it out the other day, by the Laird of Grange.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Johnston, a former Glasgow merchant, into whose home, located seven or eight miles from Ecclefechan, Carlyle was introduced by Graham. See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 83, 181; and <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250902-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1825-09-02">2 Sept. 1825</date></ref>.</note> I laughed heartily at sight of it; and behind my laugh there was a feeling still more plea<supplied>[surea]</supplied>ble. I wear the dreadnought, and like it.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-319" n="01:319"/><supplied>[The]</supplied> ham you sent is very precious; I had the upper half of it roasted lately, and smack my lips over it very delightfully every morning. I believe it is good for me; at least I wish to believe it. When I wrote Jack the weary <hi rend="italic">bowels</hi> had got cross again: but George Johnstone and I have taken them in tow, and mixed up Aloetic-wine and ginger and what not for them, by means of which we have no doubt of gaining the victory at last. I feel happier than I used to do, whenever they are well; and in process of time, I see reasonable grounds of believing that I shall after all get to something decent and honourable here. My heart longs for nothing more than the power to reward, in some degree, those who have shewn me so much honest kindness, and borne me in their arms as it were, when I could hardly bear myself. My dear Alick, let me intreat you for my sake to be kind to our father and mother. <hi rend="italic">Them</hi> (cold thought!) we have not always with us.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;For the poor always ye have with you&#x201D; (John 12:8).</note> Be kind to them then; bear with their infirmities, and cherish them with grateful affection. Can there be a triumph half so glorious for a son, as to give up his feelings in behalf of Parents whose minds or circumstances require the sacrifice? Write to me about all your straits: it does one good to tell them to a friend&#x2014;still more when the friend is a brother. Without any flattery your letters are of a <hi rend="italic">Superior</hi> quality&#x2014;with a few corrections which practice will give, I predict they will be <hi rend="italic">excellent</hi>. Attend to this and reading: it is to the mind what hewing and polish are to marble&#x2014;not merely an ornament but in some sort a creation. <closer><salute>I am always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I had this morning invited one Mr David Hope of Glasgow (nephew of the Annan gerund-grinder)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adam Hope.

George Johnstone had brought it up. There is little time for replying to all your very interesting communications, as David, whom I have been lugging thro&#x2019; the Parliament House &#x26;c, is to come and dine <pb id="pg-01-320" n="01:320"/>with me shortly: but having got hold of a fine soft pen&#x2014;with plenty of ink before me, and the best determination in the world, I purpose <hi rend="italic">dirtying</hi> this sheet for you, that if I do nothing more, I may shew the wish at least to gratify you.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Nothing but advices and advices!&#x2019; I daresay you are often tempted to exclaim on perusing my epistles; and not without reason: yet again permit me to recur to the topic of your health with the same caution as before. Walk <hi rend="italic">every day</hi>&#x2014;no concern so important; neglect no opportunity of honestly amusing yourself, and be not too fastidious on this point. Let yourself go, <foreign><hi rend="italic">abandonnez vous</hi></foreign>, to the socialities of persons from whose conversation you may gain even what you think a trifling amusement, so it be honest and inoffensive to others, no matter how silly. Absolute seclusion is absolutely corrosive to the soul. Study, of course, for by this craft you are to make your wealth both outward and inward: But do not keep yourself continually on the rack, the string that is always bent will break at length&#x2014;and long before breaking, it will get so lax and weak that nothing can be done with it. As to your scholar-craft be not too anxious. I know the grist <supplied>[size]</supplied> of our Scottish <foreign><hi rend="italic">literatuli</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A diminutive&#x2014; &#x201C;little literary men.&#x201D;</note> of the student breed at your age; and I assure you that in point of real information you need not be at all afraid to pass muster among them.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1821-01-28">28 Jan.</date>, John had written: &#x201C;I am determined to persevere. &#x2026; I say persevere because when I reflect that I a fellow of nearly 20 years of age am yet learning as it were the very rudiments of a language acquired by persons in my way of life long before they arrive at such an age, I find that I must use no middle diligence.&#x201D;</note> Your short-comings lie mostly in extraneous departments, the knowledge of languages and so forth, which a little period of application will soon enable you to master. Never fear then; be diligent in your vocation, and look forward to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> as your destination shortly, and expect nothing but success there.</p>
<p>I do not hear whether you are gone to Ben Nelson yet. I partly wish you may; for Ben is a very good intelligent person; and if once acquainted with him, you will not fail to reap advantage from intercourse with him, not to speak of the pleasure it will yield you. Is Biggar improving and progressing? or does he still navigate the quicksands of pedagogy&#x2014;his keel grating on the bottom at every turn?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John replied on <date when="1821-03-04">4 March</date>: &#x201C;The good Mr Biggar is still weltering in the quick-sands of pedagogy.&#x201D;</note> <hi rend="italic">The weather</hi> has been open for some time. I am half sorry for poor Biggar.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-321" n="01:321"/>Perhaps, however, he might reciprocate the feeling, and say, if he knew all, that he was half-sorry for me. Indeed, boy, things are still in a fluctuating state so far as I am concerned; Schiller having failed, and nothing new having cast up, I am in some sort, resting on my oars yet, and attempting <hi rend="italic">if</hi> peradventure I can see how the land lies. Yet I will not give in. Should it please Providence to continue health to me, I will make many desperate efforts still to better my position. Some translation or something similar to afford me daily <supplied>[bread]</supplied> will perhaps present itself: and then whilst <supplied>[I was exe]</supplied>cuting <supplied>[this]</supplied> I could be maturing my mind for some original effort, which at the long run must be my principal dependance. I think of Locke&#x2019;s life; and have been at the Advocates&#x2019; library (where I have gained access this winter by the introduction of Henderson<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201206-TC-MAC-01">TC to <sic>RM</sic><corr>MAC</corr>, <date when="1820-12-06">6 Dec. 1820</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;the Librarian Irving comes from Langholm) for some days investigating the sources of information, and sounding the channel I mean to ford, as it were. I see great difficulties but also great rewards, and if all go well I think it or something similar must be tried. This of course is private, must not go beyond yourselves, being only in embryo still. It serves me to think and dream about. Brewster proposes soon to settle with me; the sum about sixteen pounds&#x2014;part of which being payable by Jameson<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Jameson (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), mineralogist, was associated with Brewster in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</hi>, to which Carlyle contributed.

This kind of Authorship is very unlucrative you see; but as I get more familiar with my pen, and find fitter, more congenial employment, I shall do better. The teaching still continues: only the Hibernian has not resumed his functions: I shall make the cur settle with me any way, very speedily. I believe another hour is soon to be <hi rend="italic">prefixed</hi> to my attendance between 9 and 10; at which I am not sorry, for tho&#x2019; avoiding all needless expense, <foreign><hi rend="italic">mes finances</hi></foreign> (like poor Gil&#x2019;s)<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alain Ren&#xE9; Lesage (<date when="1668-00-00">1668</date>&#x2013;<date when="1747-00-00">1747</date>), <hi rend="italic">Gil Blas</hi>, 4 vols.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I easily comprehend the cause of your silence; and hail with satisfaction the small letter you sent me; which tho&#x2019; written in various hands does yet contain sentiments of your own and always gratifying to me. In the whole course of life I feel that I can never have but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Mother&#x2014;one friend that will attend to my interests so devotedly; and therefore it is an object of my incessant desire to testify how much I am sensible to your goodness. Words and wishes are my only means of doing so at present: but I trust the day will arrive when more substantial proofs may lie within my reach; and if I do not use them, foul befall me!</p>
<p>As to my state of health, which you inquire after, I have told the young men that it is fair rather than otherwise. These two months, of <date when="1821-01-00">January</date> and <date when="1821-02-00">February</date>, are the most trying of the whole twelve, particularly when wet and warm, as has been the case this season: so that my digestion has not been altogether so good as that of a huntsman or husbandman of late; but still I cannot complain much, and by taking good exercise, I hope as the weather mends to mend also, and finally to get completely sound. My employment, you are aware, is still very fluctuating and uncertain; but this too, I trust, will improve: I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> advancing I think, tho&#x2019; leisurely, and at last, I feel no insuperable doubts (at least when healthy) of getting into honest bread, which is all I want&#x2014;for as to fame and all that, I see it already to be nothing better than a meteor, a Will o' the Wisp which leads one on <pb id="pg-01-323" n="01:323"/>thro&#x2019; quagmires and pitfalls to catch an object which when we have caught it turns out to be&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>. I am happy to think, in the mean time, that you do not feel uneasy about my future destiny. Providence, as you observe, will order it better or worse: and with His award, so nothing mean or wicked lie before me, I shall study to rest satisfied.</p>
<p>If I were <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> vigorous and healthy, I think I might be happy here&#x2014; provided I had any thing to make my bread by. The day is very simply and agre<supplied>[e]</supplied>ably divided with me, between employment and recreation, which indeed trenches greatly upon my employment rendering too often what should be study, nothing better than a vague survey of books, amusement therefore not occupation. I rise about eight, being duly summoned by this vigilant keeper of mine; and after smoking a cigar, I progress slowly over to Great Kings-street<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Great King St. is in the New Town, north of Princes St. Carlyle&#x2019;s address on Carnegie St. was on the south side in the Old Town near the University.</note> about a mile off, to teach&#x2014;often wrapped up in an immense tartan-plaid which I lately got from Glasgow; and after ten o&#x2019;clock has struck I return home as slowly to eat my breakfast&#x2014;which usually stands in waiting for me. I take tea or coffee usually, porridge did not do. About eleven I again sally forth to walk a little, and then to go and read old books at the Advocates&#x2019; library till two or three, when dinner waits me, and soon is followed by the presence of Geo: Johnstone who writes for me an hour or two every night, and leaves me about eight or nine to fall upon some private reading, which I drop in no great length of time; and then after a walk to the end of Prince&#x2019;s-street I retire once more to repose. This is the history of a good day&#x2014;a day when I am well and fresh. At other times the procedure is more or less interrupted, I walk more, read less, and do not feel so happy. Upon the whole, however, I have no great reason to murmur, and as I said things look as if they were improving.</p>
<p>David Hope, with whom I once rode to Moffatt, was here to-day (Sandy or Jack would tell you), and left me <supplied>[an ho]</supplied>ur ago. He spoke of your friend Mrs Hope as liv<supplied>[ing]</supplied> in <supplied>[her]</supplied> own house at Musselburgh and quite reformed from her unfortunate propensities; so that she now feels comparatively happy. I sent your compliments by him (the first time he writes) and mentioned how often you had intended and how firmly to send her a letter yourself.</p>
<p>It is a striking thing and an alarming to those &#x2018;who are at ease&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Woe to them that are at ease in Zion!&#x201D; (Amos 6:1).</note> in the world, to think how many living beings&#x2014;that had breath and hope <pb id="pg-01-324" n="01:324"/>within them when I left Ecclefechan, are now numbered with the clods of the valley! Surely there is something obstinately stupid in the heart of man or &#x2018;the flight of three score years&#x2019;&#x2014;the poor cares and the poorer joys of this our pilgrimage, would never move us as they do. Why do we fret and murmur and toil and consume ourselves for objects so transient and frail? Is it that the soul, living here as in her prison-house&#x2014;strives ever after something boundless like herself &#x26; finding it nowhere, still renews the search? Surely we are fearfully and wonderfully made.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 139:14.</note>&#x2014; But I must not pursue those speculations tho&#x2019; they force themselves upon us some times, even without our asking.</p>
<p>Write to me whenever you can get a minutes time. Be careful most careful I entreat you of your health and comfort. It is invaluable to us all.</p>

<p>I send you the Virgil, My dear Jack, according to promise; and I need not say how much I wish you luck in the perusal of it. By help of the notes, and marginal interpretation&#x2014;especially if David<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Fergusson.</note> still continues with you&#x2014;I do not expect that you will find much difficulty in penetrating the meaning of this harmonious singer: and tho&#x2019; you are not likely to reckon him the &#x2018;Prince of Poets,&#x2019; you are still less likely to miss being struck with the high elegance and regular flowing pomp both of his thoughts and language.</p>
<p>I have a long sheet here before me, boy; and the consciousness that I have lately written you three or four most <hi rend="italic">leaden</hi> letters, to inspire me with greater eagerness for amendment: but alas! it is not to-day that I can amend. I have not been in worse trim for writing this twelvemonth. If you saw me sitting here with my lean and sallow visage, you would wonder how those long bloodless bony fingers could be made to move at all&#x2014;even tho&#x2019; the aching brain were by miracle enabled to supply them with materials in sufficient abundance. <pb id="pg-01-325" n="01:325"/>I have been sick, very sick, since Monday last&#x2014;indeed I have scarcely been <hi rend="italic">one day</hi> right, since I came back to this accursed, stinking, reeky mass of stones and lime and dung. I was better somewhat yesterday&#x2014;for I swallowed salts the day before to supersaturation; but to-day the <hi rend="italic">guts</hi> are all wrong again, the headache, the weakness, the black despondency are overpowering me. I fear those paltry viscera will fairly dish me at last. And do but think what a thing it is! that the etherial spirit of a man should be overpowered and hag-ridden by what? by two or three feet of sorry tripe full of &#x2014;&#x2014;. Were it by moral suffering that one sunk&#x2014;by oppression, love or hatred or the thousand ways of heartbreak&#x2014;it might be tolerable, there might at least be some dignity in the fall; but here!&#x2014; I conjure thee Jack to watch over thy health as the most precious of earthly things. I believe at this moment I would consent to become as ignorant as a Chactaw [Choctaw]&#x2014;so I were as sound of body.</p>
<p>Upon the whole it seems very cruel in me to describe my miseries in such glowing colours (does it not?), and make you unhappy, when all that you can do for me is to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> unhappy on my account. The thing is so, I do admit Jack; but really I am grown a very weak creature of late. The heart longs for some kind of sympathy: and in Edinburgh I find little of it&#x2014;except from the well-meant tho&#x2019; ineffectual kindness of Geo: Johnston, who indeed watches over me very attentively. Here was the <hi rend="italic">gritstone</hi> theologian Crone, <note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably George Cron [<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>], a student friend of Carlyle&#x2019;s studying for the ministry.</note> about half an hour ago&#x2014;he had called upon me twice&#x2014;not to ask for my welfare, but to glean information about a history of the west Indies, information which the dog means to utter as his own in some house where he is teaching. He said he was very sorry for me: I could have thrown him out at the window for his sorrow; but contented myself with saying that I knew well how deeply my condition affected his most compassionate soul.</p>
<p>You need not tell any one of those things except Sandy&#x2014;not our Mother or Father, it would but vex them; and they are not young and strong and full of hope like you to stand vexation. Nor would I have you to trouble yourselves much on my account. I shall surely get over this yet: and if summer were come I am thinking it will be well to secure quarters about Kirk<supplied>[c]</supplied>aldy or some bathing town &#x26; transport myself thither with all my tackle, to enjoy the manifold benefits of such a station. There is a project on foot about translating one D'Aubuisson <pb id="pg-01-326" n="01:326"/><supplied>[a]</supplied> Frenchman&#x2019;s geology&#x2014;a large book, for the first edition of which I am to have 60 guineas&#x2014;the same sum for every succeeding edition.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Jean Aubuisson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Trait&#xE9; de g&#xE9;ognosie</hi> (Strasbourg, <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>), but possibly his <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moire sur les basaltes de Saxe</hi> (Paris, <date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>).</note> Brewster was <hi rend="italic">very</hi> diligent in forwarding it; and tho&#x2019; I neither like the book nor the terms excessively, I feel much o<supplied>[blige]</supplied>d to him for his conduct.

<salute>My dear brother,</salute>
<p>No doubt the last mournful intelligence, received from me, must have made you somewhat anxious about my state; and as I am here in a situation where the voice of your feelings cannot reach me, it becomes a duty which I owe your friendship, and which I gladly pay, to give you some notice of my actual condition and history up to this date. I know you will be obliged to me rather than otherwise for this <pb id="pg-01-327" n="01:327"/>effort, and I gratify my own heart while at the same time I do my best to satisfy yours. My dear Alick, your cares about me are very kind, but I assure you they are also superfluous. I am getting fast round again; indeed nothing in the slightest degree dangerous ever ailed me; and if my health were once fairly reestablished, I have little or no fear that in process of time&#x2014;in a short process of it too&#x2014;I shall yet be enabled to make remuneration for all the generous and hearty support I have experienced at the hands of my relations. But the truth is, Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is so lonely and desolate a place to me as yet, that, when any thing affects the outward man, the inward gets so gloomy and desponding on the subject as you never saw: then I write letters home of the most sable complexion&#x2014;all is up&#x2014;quite finished&#x2014;and I myself feel quite as miserable as could be expected. This disorder in the stomach too is one of the most overwhelming that afflict the feeble race of man. There is nothing immediately dangerous to life in it; but the effects of it upon the soul are more appalling than I can well describe. It chains down the fiercest spirit, and lays it prostrate in a dungeon built of the blackest materials which imagination can furnish. So that you see I have no reason to love this complaint; and the less so, as I feel (without vanity, I may say it to you) that but for its puny interference, I should run little risk of attaining the object of my wishes&#x2014;a settlement in life, and the power to reward and gratify my benefactors. I know there is within me something <hi rend="italic">different</hi> from the vulgar herd of mortals; I think it is something <hi rend="italic">superior</hi>; and if once I had overpassed those bogs and brakes and quagmires,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>, III, iv.</note> that lie between me and the free arena, I shall make some fellows stand to the right and left&#x2014;or I mistake me greatly. Then what a thing it will be! How bright and balmy to the mind, when I shall come trolling down to Annandale, and find &#x2018;Polwarth&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Obviously a playful allusion to Alick, whom Carlyle is presumably elevating to the peerage, possibly after the Scottish peer Sir Patrick Hume (or Home), first Earl of Marchmont and Baron Polwarth (<date when="1641-00-00">1641</date>&#x2013;<date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>).</note> on his own farm, turning the glebe like a free subject of Nature&#x2014;when I (being a noted man then) shall deliver myself up to all manner of talking and <hi rend="italic">blathering</hi> and outpouring of the heart; and all of us shall rejoice because all of us&#x2014;if not blessed&#x2014;are contented, and footing our journey thro&#x2019; this transient country, with the firm pace and erect countenance of honest men!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p><pb id="pg-01-328" n="01:328"/>But I am spending your nine-pence-half-penny on that which profiteth not. Better for me to tell you about my health, as was the first design. I think I continued getting better of the sickness ever after writing to you; but as the digestive organs still continued faithless, and hence the whole body very weak, George Johnstone (my most faithful sick-nurse) began to advise me very strenuously to make arrangements for spending a month or six weeks in the country. I myself was at length beginning to contemplate the pleasure of riding about perpetually on the back of Dumple,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A horse at Mainhill.</note> I thought of drinking warm new-milk, and of a nursing-mother, and casting all cares at my back for the space of five weeks or so: but on the other hand Edward Irving advised me to the contrary, and warmly seconded all the objections (but too many, alas!) which I had to offer against this arrangement. So after all was done, we partly compromised the matter: I accompanied Irving over here on Saturday last, took up my abode <supplied>[at]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Provost Swan&#x2019;s&#x2014;and as on all hands they kindly invite me to continue, I have allowed Irving to return (he went back some hours ago) and having made some arrangements about the private teaching&#x2014;it is finally settled that I am to continue here for a few days till my bowels shall have recovered in some degree their original tone. I must be back before Friday again; but even already the sea-breezes are acting beneficially on me; and in two or three days I expe<supplied>[et]</supplied> they will have set me in such a case that zealous exercise will keep me <supplied>[m]</supplied>oderately well in that old smoky city&#x2014;the smoke of which <supplied>[I]</supplied> sicken at&#x2014;even while viewing it across the pure azure frith of Forth. You know this &#x2018;long town&#x2019;; and you can easily conceive with what emotions of melancholy pleasure, of joy and sadness, I traverse all the well-known turnings of it.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kirkcaldy was called &#x201C;long town&#x201D; because of the original prolonged stretch of its single street, which ran parallel to the shore for more than a mile.

I view Kirk<supplied>[c]</supplied>aldy like an old acquaintance that is fast forgetting me, that I am fast forgetting: yet there are some people in it whom I could wish to remember and be remembered by. They are not many; they are the more valuable for
that. Tom Grieve<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> I saw to-day. He is very <pb id="pg-01-329" n="01:329"/>poorly or rather has been&#x2014;but is getting better slowly. He is an hone<supplied>[st]</supplied> body; and I rejoice to see him prospering in his own small way. Swan speaks of sending the boy<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Patrick Swan.</note> over to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to live with me, that is next winter. I expect Jack will be there too; but we have made no arrangements yet. I have been partly <hi rend="italic">spiering</hi> out some private teaching for Jack, and think I may succeed.</p>
<p>I had some translations &#x26;c &#x26;c on the carpet for myself; but I have heard no more word of them&#x2014;every one of my concerns having been stationary for two weeks past. I have other plans beside, my boy; and I want nothing but health to execute them&#x2014;which upon the whole, I have little doubt of regaining shortly. But I must be done here&#x2014;for an obvious reason. You will excuse my chit-chat style of writing and my <hi rend="italic">no</hi>-information thus communicated. I have written in the Provost&#x2019;s parlour&#x2014;with a dull (not aching) head and boys running round like merry-andrews. Send word to my trusty Jack how I am.

<salute>My dear Father,</salute>
<p>You would get the letter addressed to Sandy from Kirk<supplied>[c]</supplied>aldy about thursday-morning; and I trust it would have the effect of calming your solicitudes on account of my health and outward welfare about which I have lately given you so much unprofitable anxiety. The sea-breezes of Fife, and the kind attentions of its inhabitants produced the most salutary results on me;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had gone with Irving to Provost Swan&#x2019;s on <date when="1821-02-17">17 Feb.</date>; after Irving left, Carlyle stayed on until <date when="1821-02-23">23 Feb.</date> (Friday).</note> I grew better every day, and in the course of a few weeks I doubt not I should have been as strong as ever at any period of my life. It was with regret that I quitted them on friday to meet Irving here, who, however, in the interim had been forced to return home. I felt in a state of decided convalescence, which I am happy to add has since continued without interruption. <pb id="pg-01-330" n="01:330"/>The sickness has <hi rend="italic">altogether</hi> left me, and I am well as heretofore: for though the stomach and bowels still continue lazy, a little attention aided by a little physic<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unquestionably, Carlyle seriously damaged his digestive system by taking laxatives too often.</note> will suffice to keep <hi rend="italic">them</hi> to their duty, and <hi rend="italic">me</hi> from a state of weak discomfort, about which I am glad to think that you can form no adequate conception. One becomes so dim and overclouded, so wrapt up in sack<supplied>[c]</supplied>loth and ashes&#x2014;so full of inquietude and chagrin, it is really quite pitiful to think of: and if exercise, regimen and every species of care can secure me, I have the best of all possible motives for applying them. You need be under no apprehensions:&#x2014;for my letters (I speak in sincerity of heart) do always give the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> view of my condition, seeing I hold it advisable to conceal nothing in such cases; and therefore I may gain belief now when I assure you that I am quite as easy, and but that I am a degree leaner (can any one give faith to it?), quite as vigorous as I generally was last summer. I shall tell you at once if any alteration for the worse occur; which, however, I am far enough from anticipating.</p>
<p>On returning to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;where the minister of Kirk<supplied>[c]</supplied>aldy&#x2019;s son<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Samuel Martin (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">50</date>), the only son old enough to act as tutor. He was ordained in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date> and afterward became minister of Bathgate, West Lothian. Edward Irving married his sister Isabella.</note> had been carrying on my pedagogic duties&#x2014;I found Jack&#x2019;s letter, about a week old, tho&#x2019; &#x2018;haste&#x2019; stood glaring on the back of it. The perusal of that sheet bedimmed my eyes a little, tho&#x2019; they are not of a very moist nature;&#x2014;and it gave me an unspeakable pleasure to find that my father&#x2019;s house was still not only open for me in the season of need, but warmed by all the tenderness and affectionate anxiety which are so gratifying to a sick and weary <supplied>[spi]</supplied>rit. My heart-felt gratitude is with you all. Assure my Mother in particular that I remember her care of me in former emergencies; and desire nothing in this world more earnestly than that she would apply the same with success to herself. I will come home if I should grow useless here or run the risk of growing useless: but at present I look forward to a busy and therefore a contented summer, in which I shall accomplish much, and among other things the long wished for results of gaining for myself some permanent employment, so that I may no longer wander about the earth a moping hypochondriac, the soul eating up itself for want of something else to act upon, or a withered schoolmaster eyeing my fellow men with a suspicion and solitary shrinking, which should be peculiar to felons and other violators of the law.</p>
 <p><pb id="pg-01-331" n="01:331"/>In fact, matters have a more promising appearance with me at the present date than they have had for a long season. Besides Jack&#x2019;s letter and some others which awaited my return from Fife, there was one, which I read with indifference, abandoning the proposed undertaking of translating D'aubuisson (for which consult Sandy); and one, which I read with considerable interest proferring to me on the part of Bookseller Tait to <hi rend="italic">become a candidate</hi> for the translating of a French book, Maltebrun&#x2019;s Geography,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Conrad Malte-Brun (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>), geographer. The work referred to is almost certainly his <hi rend="italic">Pr&#xE9;cis de la g&#xE9;ographie universelle</hi> (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-00-00">29</date>), 8 vols. and atlas. By <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date> five volumes were out.</note> which one Adam Black,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Politician and publisher (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>). See <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2491"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>.</note> Taits brother-in-law, is engaged with at present, and designs to put into fresh hands. Two persons (unknown to me) are to submit specimens of their work, I am to do so likewise; &#x26; Tait assures me that if Black had known <supplied>[me]</supplied> sooner there would have been no competition in the case. So that I am not without hopes of getting this job, and if the judge be a correct one, of deserving it. You may think the latter proviso is like dropping feather-beds out of a window from which one is soon to be precipitated in person: but within my own mind, I feel a kind of assurance that I can surpa<supplied>[ss]</supplied> the fellow-translators, unless they are far superior to the <supplied>[usual]</supplied> run of such creatures. And if I divine aright, it will be very advantageous for me: a steady employment (the book extends to five or six large volumes&#x2014;of which only one and a part are finished) that I can address myself to in any humour&#x2014;for it requires no study; and by means of which it would not be difficult to clear the matter of &#xa3;200 per annum, for a considerable time. I shall hear of it by and by&#x2014;like <supplied>[e]</supplied>nough I may fail in those ex<supplied>[pec]</supplied>tations; but can do either way.</p>
<p>I had also a kind of advantage lately over one Waugh, a vapouring bookseller and bailie of this city&#x2014;about whose treatment of me very probably Alick may be able to give you some information. Mr Duncan introduced me to him that I might write in a Review he was starting about two years ago:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18191118-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1819-11-18">18 Nov. 1819</date></ref>; and <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281211-TCJWC-HI-01">TC to HI, <date when="1828-12-11">11 Dec. 1828</date></ref>. The review was the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Monthly Review</hi> (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821-00-00">21</date>), about to reappear as the <hi rend="italic">New Edinburgh Review</hi>.</note> but the man swaggered and swelled at such a rate, and was so <hi rend="italic">condescending</hi> to me withal, that I left him finally to delight his addle brain with visions of the many pounds and much civic honour he is master of&#x2014;and went on my way without his shining. The Review has been consumptive, however, for some time; and Waugh having heard news of me desired that I should be again introduced <pb id="pg-01-332" n="01:332"/>to him. I went with Murray, my old acquaintance, to-day; and the bailie, at first embarrassed, finally requested with much deference that I would stand by him in the critical undertaking. I can have work, therefore, and good pay when I please; and if health continue there is no fear.&#x2014; But my sheet is done, and my feet are cold&#x2014;good reasons both for drawing to a close. I long to hear news of you all; but I suppose Farries had stolen a march on you, or you expected me home. <closer><salute>My love to all there.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Twelve o&#x2019;clock is past; but I confide in Garthwaites unpunctuality a little, and send you two lines of advice about your studies merely&#x2014;for about this time, I guess, you are reading the letter sent by Gavin, which will satisfy you on all other points<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>You have certainly been very diligent if you can at all read Virgil &#x26; Sallust in so short a time. I really wonder at it. You must give up the Georgics,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The letter in which John speaks of the <hi rend="italic">Georgics</hi> has not been found.</note> however, I think without delay. They are the most uninteresting and by far the most difficult of all Virgil&#x2019;s writings. Take to the <supplied>[A]</supplied>Eneid immediately; you will like it far better. Do you mind the Grammar? And the scanning? Attend to <hi rend="italic">both</hi> particularly. For Sallust, you cannot go wrong. Cataline is an admirable narrative; and the writer of it, ever shews himself the same lynx-eyed, hard-headed, bitter little <hi rend="italic">tarrier</hi> [terrier]; to whom nothing was agreeable because nothing was pure; and still more because he was not pure himself. Crispus<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gaius Sallustius Crispus, or Sallust (<date>86</date>&#x2013;<date>34 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), partisan of Julius Caesar and Roman historian who wrote the <hi rend="italic">Conspiracy of Catiline</hi>.</note> was a <foreign><hi rend="italic">rip</hi></foreign> [rascal] of a body, in his youth. When you read the <supplied>[A]</supplied>Eneid do not fail to admire the calm gracefulness, the stately and harmonious diction, the clear imagination of Maro; but do not expect to have your <hi rend="italic">winnow-cloth</hi> expanded by the grandeur and immensity <pb id="pg-01-333" n="01:333"/>of Milton, or your heart quickened by his stern and elevated strength of soul. Each after his kind. Think too that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (poor Jack in Bitty Geel&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His Annan landlady&#x2019;s.</note>) do actually read the very words and admire the very thoughts that Augustus read &#x26; admired two thousand years ago, and all great men since. Let this be a spur in the head, which is better than two in the heel&#x2014;than the pressure of want&#x2014;that is&#x2014;or the lure of gain.</p>
<p>But do not, do not, I repeat it, neglect your morning and evening walks&#x2014;&#x26; your talks and laughs &#x26; recreations. It is well to read Johnstone&#x2019;s Lives; tho&#x2019; the man is prejudiced to a pitch (see Milton &#x26; Gray), he has great power of head, &#x26; his insensibility to the higher beauties of poetry does not extend to the most complicated questions of reasoning. His Rambler is very good; but not so amusing. Can you not get Shakespeare, or Byron? Goldsmith&#x2019;s Essays are &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">capital</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;in style and liveliness. Dean Swift is a merry grinning dog. Did you ever see his tale of a Tub. John Johnstone (Mrs Dr&#x2019;s) has it &#x26; will lend it. Johnson&#x2019;s &#x2018;Journey to the western isles&#x2019; is likewise good. And Don Quixote&#x2014;read it, till your sides crack which they will do, if you have risi<supplied>[ble or]</supplied>gans. <hi rend="italic">Try</hi> if you can get Russel&#x2019;s history of Modern Europe.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18180216-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1818-02-16">16 Feb. 1818</date></ref>.</note> George Irving will procure it from the library of the burgh.&#x2014; Except the last, those things are principally for amusement: yet if you attend to the style&#x2014;and imitate it judiciously they will profit you not a little.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It will be noted that this reading list for John, &#x201C;principally for amusement,&#x201D; is in the main more literary and less historical than the ones Carlyle was to provide for William Graham and Jane Welsh. Later he was to discover that John needed no admonition not to take matters too seriously. He was the easygoing member of the family.</note> At any rate they fill the head pleasantly, and therefore usefully. We shall talk of your school when I come hame, about <date when="1821-08-00">August</date> or so. Perhaps you may get some teaching here, which will do better. Go on &#x26; prosper my boy! There is no fear. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho' you have not said a word to me personally for a great while, I am well aware that there is no one in the world who has experienced more anxiety on my account of late, or will experience more satisfaction, at being told that I am now relieved from my state of languor and pain, into a state of comparative strength and happiness. I know not whether I am rightly thankful to Providence for this great blessing, but certainly I am <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;unco&#x2019;</hi> [uncommonly] <hi rend="italic">glad'</hi> as your pauper said; &#x26; I cannot resist the desire of communicating the agreeable intelligence to you myself, tho&#x2019; very much straitened in time, &#x26; obliged, as you see, to content myself with a half-sheet, notwithstanding your wellknown repugnance to such penurious doings. Another object which I have in view in writing to you is to inquire most minutely into your own state of health, which I fear is nothing so good as it should be. My dear Mother, let me council you to spare no trouble or care, with regard to this. Endeavour to avoid all things that will fret or discompose your mind, be as much as possible in the open air, and go about to visit your friends and acquaintance in the neighbourhood, whenever you can&#x2014;by any means go. I am most anxious to hear a full and <hi rend="italic">faithful</hi> account of this matter from your own hand.</p>
<p>A third object which I had in view which is indeed most worthy of being named with the other too <supplied>[two]</supplied>, but which has some weight nevertheless,&#x2014;was to beg for a box with some cakes &#x26;c by means of which I may send home some of those foul clothes that have now attained a very considerable magnitude. The butter too is on its last legs; and their Irish stuff I fear is not good here. A pound or two will serve. I have had no cakes for many days; &#x26; tho&#x2019; they are not a favourite food with me, I like to see them now &#x26; then.</p>
 <p>But above all, you must write to me, if you can find any time. I am ignorant, and not patiently ignorant, of all your movements. You must send a description of the whole. For myself besides what I have detailed in many recent letters to my various correspondents at Mainhill, there is little that I can add at present. I write a very little, read some and walk some; and that is almost all my history. <pb id="pg-01-335" n="01:335"/>Last sabbath, I was to hear Dr M'Crie (Author of Knox his life)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Thomas M'Crie (<date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), Secession minister who set up his own group after his expulsion. He had a church in Davie St., Edinburgh. In <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date> he helped to form the &#x201C;original seceders.&#x201D; His <hi rend="italic">Life of John Knox</hi> was published in <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>. See <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17406"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> and <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220427-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1822-04-27">27 April 1822</date></ref>.</note> who preaches to <supplied>[a]</supplied> few poor people within two or three hundred yards of this. He is an earnest-looking, lean, acute-minded man; with much learning and thought, but no eloquence. It did me good to <supplied>[see]</supplied> the poor people with their clean faces, their attentive looks, and to hear our own old St Pau<supplied>[l&#x2019;s]</supplied> and St Peter&#x2019;s (venerable tunes!)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Psalm tunes.</note> chaunted with so much alacrity and apparent devoutness. It brought the little meeting house at home, and all the innocent joyance of childhood back to mingle strangely with the agitations of after-life. <closer><salute>But I have done. Is there any book that I can get you, or <hi rend="italic">any</hi> thing that I can do for you? Speak if there is; and gratify your affectionate &#x26; thankful boy.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Without doubt, there is some fatality attached to the out-goings and in-comings of that Waffler, whether he appear in the character of Agriculturist, Carrier, Salesman or dozing loiterer&#x2014;a man unstable in all his ways, a chirping, joyous unthoughtful thing, on whom the strokes of fate descend like &#x2018;cannon-ball on feather-bed,&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi>, II, 871&#x2013;72.</note> impressing a momentary vibration, but not a particle of steadiness or attention. I heard accidentally of his being in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last week, and forthwith prepared a long letter for my Father, which I delivered accordingly at his quarters, before departing-time. I gave it to the servant, who I suppose has neglected her solemn promise&#x2014;confiding in Geordie&#x2019;s placability; unless that vigorous traveller (as is more likely) have forgotten to do his part in the affair; and so given you the uneasiness of hope deferred, and me the pleasure of again writing to you&#x2014;which, however, I am not selfish enough to relish at such a price. If the latter conjecture be true, your anxieties will be relieved before this time; but I know too well how you will feel if it be false, to leave any thing <pb id="pg-01-336" n="01:336"/>to the guidance of Chance in that matter, and therefore I lose not a moment&#x2019;s time in putting you to peace in your most affectionate cares so far as I am able.</p>
<p>It is difficult for me to represent correctly the state I am in; for like that of most persons in my situation, it varies a good deal from day to day, I might almost say from hour to hour. I shall try, however, to make you <hi rend="italic">sinsible</hi> as the Hibernians say; and at all events I protest you may rely on my fidelity. First then, I tell you <hi rend="italic">I am not sick</hi>, all that went away in Fife, and has never since returned; I feel as sound outwardly as any ploughman in Annandale. With regard to inwards, however, there is certainly a distinction to be made: I have to take physic more or less every day, and still things won&#x2019;t go on comfortably; the stomach is rather (not by any means, very) painful, and its disordered condition enfeebles me, and makes me stupid. It &#x2018;found me <hi rend="italic">lean</hi> at first, and keeps me so&#x2019;; in fact I am grown leaner.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Paradiso,&#x201D; XXV, 1&#x2013;4. Carlyle alludes to Dante&#x2019;s condition brought about by the labor expended on <hi rend="italic">The Divine Comedy</hi>. He employs the quotation again in &#x201C;Sir Walter Scott,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 80; <hi rend="italic">Heroes and Hero-Worship, Works</hi>, V, 90; and <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi>, X, 205.</note> I walk pretty reasonably when the weather is favourable; &#x26; had hopes, which I expressed in our Father&#x2019;s letter, of getting <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> sound again <hi rend="italic">very shortly</hi>; hopes which a succession of wet days, &#x26; consequently of indolent dissipated reading-fits on my part, have partly removed to a greater distance, tho&#x2019; not at all destroyed. In the last place, I have a sharp appetite, and eat my victuals with considerable relish.</p>
<p>Such is a true statement of the Case. Judge then, my Brother, if it is not unwise in you to torment yourselves so much because of me! Nothing dangerous or in the least like danger is connected with those symptoms. They are merely the usual concomitants of a sedentary habit&#x2014;suffered by thousands equally with me, but aggravated in my case by the solitary and agitated life I have led for the last seven years, and do not yet see any very certain means of escaping from. This town is not wholesome for me; but it is the proper place in every other point of view. I must live by Literature, at all hazards; and now is the time for making connexions and opening channels to secure a living by it. Teaching absolutely will not do for me; the mind <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> repress her longings and high aspirings within the narrow and most paltry limits of a borough-school; and in bitterness of heart I have frequently resolved to suffer all extremities before resuming the ferula. What then is to be done? Write and fight and struggle &#x2018;faint yet pursuing&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Judg. 8:4.</note> <pb id="pg-01-337" n="01:337"/>till some market occur for those silly powers such as they are. Now by returning to Mainhill&#x2014;grant that I should recover health&#x2014;do I not leave behind me all the springs by which I was attempting to move the world? I come to secrete myself from the business of life as well as from its vexations, and to harrass honest people who ha<supplied>[ve]</supplied> other things to mind with my moon-struck humours and frail complainings. Besides I shall have nothing to do, and so get discontented. There was a book Maltebrun (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210225-TC-JCE-01">Father&#x2019;s letter</ref>) that I expected to get the translating of, which would have been the very upmaking of me: but it is fled&#x2014;or at least far postponed&#x2014;and not to be calculated on. They paid me &#xa3;2&#x2013;2 for my work, and the rest &#x2018;cannot be settled for a long time.&#x2019; Then Waugh&#x2019;s review: but I expect little good of it. And to think of the silly appearance the matter will have. See to the Mainhill <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi>! Come back a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> time to lounge and mope about the moors! Poor creature! I pity him.</p>
<p>Not that I have absolutely determined against coming home. Indeed generally every morning when I feel the gnawings within, and penetrate the dense vapour that overhangs S. Bridge-street on my way to teach, I half think&#x2014;this will never do, I must southward but as the day breaks up I get brighter thoughts&#x2014;and resolve almost to stay and accustom myself betimes to this my destined place of residence, if ever I get any such place. I reflect that I have teaching <hi rend="italic">to keep me</hi>, and if I had but health&#x2014;! &#x2014;So the conclusion, my dear boy, is one in which nothing is concluded. I cannot know for a week or so. Yet be easy I tell you. I am not unhappy, I am only dull and frail. No sunshine of the soul, nor yet the darkness and the whirlwind,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Pope, <hi rend="italic">An Essay on Man</hi>, IV, 168; and Vergil&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Georgics</hi>, I, 320.</note> but a kind of gray twilight weather&#x2014;unmovingly covers all my prospects. I shall fix soon: and while dressing up lives &#x26;c soon to be needed by Brewster, I promise faithfully to leave all&#x2014;if I am not better in a week or at farthest two. I might come easily. But to mount the coach here at eight o&#x2019;clock, and find you with the good Dumple at Moffatt, saddled and corned and rested against four. We should be home by nine. My dear Alick, I am sorry the sheet is done, I could tattle with you for a month. I will write by Farries&#x2014;sooner if aught occur. So be <foreign><hi rend="italic">azy</hi></foreign> [easy]! <closer><salute>My love to our Father &#x26; Mother and all the others. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I have wasted this whole blessed evening in reading poetry and stuff, while I should have been writing a substantial life of Necker, out of materials accumulated two days ago; and now that 11 o&#x2019;clock is struck, I may as well devote the remaining hour to your gratification, and my own, in this new mode, which, if equally idle with the mode it succeeds, has at least the merit of amusing two at once. Your letter &#x26; your half-letter both came to hand;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The half letter is John&#x2019;s part of a letter written by him and Alexander Carlyle to Thomas, <date when="1821-03-05">5 March</date>. The full letter by John seems to be missing.</note> and before this reaches you the answer to them will also have come, and relieved you, I trust, from the pain which my late spiritless communications naturally inflicted on you. The invitation you give me, and the affectionate eloquence you enforce it with, touched me to the quick: and tho&#x2019; I still hope to get through without that last resource, it is most gratifying to see it in store for me should Necessity require it. But I must not yield so heartlessly: it is a shame and a misery to me at this age to be gliding about in strenuous idleness,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi>, I, xi, 28; <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230308-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1823-03-08">8 March 1823</date></ref>; and <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230831-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-08-31">31 Aug. 1823</date></ref>.</note> with no hand in the game of life, where I have yet so much to win, no outlet for the restless faculties, which are thus up in mutiny and
slaying one another for lack of fair enemies. I must do or die, 
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Burns, &#x201C;Scots Wha Hae,&#x201D; last line.</note> then, as the song goes: and
Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> with all its drawbacks is the only scene for me. In the country I am like an
alien&#x2014;a stranger and a pilgrim from a far-distant land&#x2014; I wander in a kind of waking dream 
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Keats, &#x201C;Ode to a Nightingale,&#x201D; l. 79.</note> and make no progress in
gaining relief from it. In summer I must endeavour most sternly, for this state of things cannot last;
and if health do but revisit me (as I know she will) it shall ere long give place to a better. If I grow
seriously ill, indeed, it will be different; but when once the weather is settled and dry, exercise and
care will restore me completely. I am considerably clearer than when I wrote Sandy, the day before
yesterday, and I should have been still more so had not this afternoon been wet, and so prevented me
from breathing the air of Arthur&#x2019;s seat, a mountain close beside us where the atmosphere is pure as a
diamond, and the prospect <pb id="pg-01-339" n="01:339"/>grander than any you ever saw. 
<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur&#x2019;s Seat is a high rocky hill near the center of Edinburgh to the south-east, not
 far from the Palace of Holyrood in the Queen&#x2019;s Park.</note> The blue majestic, everlasting ocean, with
the Fife hills swelling gradually into the Grampians behind it on the north; rough crags and rude
precipices at our feet (&#x2018;where not a hillock rears its head unsung&#x2019;) 
<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> with Edinburgh at their base, clustering proudly over her
rugged foundations, and covering with a vapoury mantle the jagged, black, venerable masses of
stone-work, that stretch far and wide and shew like a city of fairy-land&#x2014; There&#x2019;s for you man! I
saw it all last evening&#x2014;when the sun was going down&#x2014;and the moon&#x2019;s fine crescent (like a
pretty silver creature as it is) was riding quietly above me. Such a sight does one good; tho&#x2019; none be
there to share it, except the Jurisconsult&#x2014;&#x2018;poorest of the sons of Earth.&#x2019; 
<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Dalgleish.</note></p>
<p>But I am leading you astray after my fantasies&#x2014;when I should be inditing plain prose. It
is painful for me to learn that you already begin to experience the effects of too close application.
Let it be a warning, My dear Jack, I solemnly charge you; or the issue will make you repent it bitterly,
when it cannot be remedied. Why do you sit so constantly poring over books? Go out, I tell you; and talk
with <hi rend="italic">any</hi> mortal to relieve your mind rather than converse perpetually with the imagination.
What would you be at, man? Your learning is advanced most respectably; and depend upon it there is a
learning more available often than the learning of books, the learning of the ways of men, which cannot
be acquired except from conversing with them and observing them. Speak with all honest men
then&#x2014;enter into their views&#x2014;and be one of them. I have suffered deeply from ignorance of
this counsel, which I offer you with all the warmth of fraternal affection. Do not disregard it. I would
advise you also to bethink you of some Profession, on which to fix your endeavours; for it is an unlucky
thing to be drifting on the waves of Chance as I am now, and must long be, without companion or guide on
my track, which for aught I know may lead me into whirlpools or breakers after all. What think you of the Church? or of Medicine? or <hi rend="italic">can</hi> you teach for a livelihood? Consider this matter, and write me about it fully. In fact you must study to be more copious in your details henceforth. Is not paper cheap, the postage nothing? And what need for caring <hi rend="italic">how</hi> you write to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. Tell me every thing&#x2014;whether you are merry or sad&#x2014;busy or idle&#x2014;your whole <foreign><hi rend="italic">mani&#xE8;re d'&#xEA;tre et d'existes</hi></foreign> [way of being and existence]. <pb id="pg-01-340" n="01:340"/>Is Waugh still with you? Remember me to the luckless. Are you teaching Ben? Is Davie teaching you? How do you like Maro? How are they at Mainhill? &#x26;c &#x26;c &#x26;c</p>
 <p>There has been a duel at London as you would see by the Scotsman. It has made and is making a great noise here; keeps all jaws tinkling and all tongues wagging&#x2014;for it is political, Scott having been a Whig and Lockhart the forlorn hope of our Tories. The latter has taken to bed, I hear; and well he may.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Friday, <date when="1821-02-23">23 Feb.</date>, Dr. John Scott (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>) and Jonathan Christie fought a duel at Chalk Farm, and Scott died a few days later.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>They have given me short measure today; and I must give you the like, tho&#x2019; you deserve it not. On returning from my Morning&#x2019;s task of two hours<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of tutoring.</note> (which I discharge usually with as much insensibility as old <hi rend="italic">Rose</hi> would drag a cart-load of dung), I was hailed by the grateful appearance of a small gray parcel&#x2014;its countenance well known to me&#x2014;lying in state among the tea-tackle destined to administer my breakfast. &#x2018;If you have <hi rend="italic">any</hi> word,&#x2019; said the Landlady with her Celtic drawl, &#x2018;the Carrier is going away at twelve o&#x2019;clock.&#x2019; It was then half-past ten: so you see what you must look for.</p>
<p>The little time I have, will enable me, however, to do important services to you; for it requires but a single line from my hand&#x2014;and for some days I have longed to have an opportunity of giving it&#x2014;to remove a load of uneasiness from the hearts of all my most kind friends at Mainhill. I am now quite recovered. The fine weather, and the diligent use I make of it, have restored me to as good a state of health as I have enjoyed for six months. I am getting stronger daily; and if matters do but go on thus, before the time of bathing on these coasts begins, I shall be in excellent condition to profit by it, and thereby acquire that soundness of body without which all the gifts of Providence are of no avail. I walk daily for a considerable time; I read too a little, but nothing that requires <hi rend="italic">study</hi>; I frequent the Advocates&#x2019; Library, and drive on the time, by all those resources, with considerable equanimity. Doubtless I am not quite comfortable, nor shall I be so, or wish to be so, until I have found some resting-place for the soles of my feet,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 8:9.</note> and some handywork, by labouring at which I may obtain a share, greater or less, in the comforts and accom<supplied>[m]</supplied>odations of this life.</p>
<p>The translation of Maltebrun about which I wrote lately would have answered very well in some respects; and I am not still without a chance of getting it: but the man Black having received a very <hi rend="italic">penitential</hi> letter from his present most unworthy translator<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Black&#x2019;s edition (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">33</date>) of Malte-Brun (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>) in translation does not name the translator.</note> (a reduced <hi rend="italic">knight</hi> at Paris!) has consented to let him try his hand a little <pb id="pg-01-342" n="01:342"/>farther. I shall hear no more of the matter, then, at least for a considerable time. Except as it &#x2018;brings grist to the mill&#x2019; this work of Translation is not, after all, too desirable an occupation. It is nearly as unintellectual as <foreign><hi rend="italic">dyking</hi></foreign> [building walls]; and besides the money that springs from it, no other benefit, no increase of reputation or even notoriety, is attached to it in any sense. Original composition, then, is better in most points, inferior only as it is more difficult&#x2014;which is but another reason for setting about learning it without delay. I shall do it easily enough, by and by; and the present is no bad opportunity for trying. Waugh (the Review-man) sent me a book the other day, with a wish and an assurance that I &#x2018;would write a very elegant and spirited critique on it&#x2019;&#x2014;which I am not so certain of as the magistrate pretends to be, but shall attempt notwithstanding. It is poetry, by Joanna Baillie,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), Scottish poet and dramatist. Carlyle&#x2019;s critique of Miss Baillie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Metrical Legends of Exalted Characters</hi> (<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>) appeared in the <hi rend="italic">New Edinburgh Review</hi>, I (<date when="1821-10-00">Oct. 1821</date>), 393&#x2013;414.</note> about Wallace and Columbus and patient Griseld, and so forth. I am to begin forthwith; should have begun indeed already, but Schiller and others stand in the way. I am told the man Waugh pays well: and if he and I do not suit, I have still plenty of work in the Encyclopedia, and am daily getting better acquainted with the mode of transacting it. So you observe there is no fear of me, none whatever.</p>
<p>I have talked so much about those things of late, and made you talk so much about them, that absolutely I am grown very ignorant about your doings at Mainhill. I figure you as stalking &#x2018;with measured step&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Il Penseroso,&#x201D; l. 38; <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels, Works</hi>, XXIV, 340.</note> over the new mould, and committing your grain to the bosom of the Earth&#x2014;in plain prose, I figure you as sowing, and I think the seed-time must be favourable. But you must take a large sheet and tell me minutely about every thing&#x2014;your operations, your reading, your thoughts, your news, and all that interests you. Do you get any written now? Neglect no opportunity of improving yourself in this most saleable of accomplishments&#x2014; It is sure to do you much, and may eventually do you <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> service. Tell me all the news too. Which of the children are at School? Have you seen James Johnstone&#x2019;s letter from New York, &#x26; could I see it? If not what are its contents? <closer><salute>Tell me all this &#x26; much more, as you love,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mitchell,</salute>
<p>I have just read over your letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter and other letters from Mitchell near this date do not seem to have been preserved.</note> and t<supplied>[o]</supplied> shew you that I am not utterly extinguished in sloth, I sit down to pen an answer instantly. The colossal &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi>&#x2019; with <hi rend="italic">Thekla</hi> the angelical, and <hi rend="italic">Max</hi> her impetuous lofty-minded lover are all gone to rest;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wallenstein&#x2019;s daughter; Max is Max Piccolomini, her lover.</note> I have closed Schiller for a night; and what can I do better than chat for one short hour with my old, my earliest friend? I have nothing to tell you, it is true; but the mere neighbourhood of your image brings so many pleasing tho&#x2019; pensive recollections, so many shadows of departed years along with it, that I may well write <hi rend="italic">without</hi> having any thing to say. And do not fear, my gentle brother, that I will lead you into the mazes of Kantism; I know you have but a limited relish for such mysteries, and among my many faults, an enemy even would not reckon the inordinate desire of making proselytes. As to Kant and Schelling and Fichte<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Immanuel Kant (<date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>), Friedrich von Schelling (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), Johann Gottlieb Fichte (<date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>), all German philosophers.</note> and all those worthies, I profess myself but an esoteric after all; and whoever can imagine that Stewart and Hume with Reid and Brown<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scottish philosophers. Dugald Stewart wrote the life of Thomas Reid (<date when="1710-00-00">1710</date>&#x2013;<date when="1796-00-00">96</date>) and had Thomas Brown (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>) as a colleague professor after <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>.</note> to help them have sounded all the depths of our nature, or which is better, can contrive to overlook those mysteries entirely,&#x2014;is too fortunate a gentleman for me to intermeddle with. Nor shall I trouble <pb id="pg-01-344" n="01:344"/>you with my views of men,&#x2014;at least not greatly; and for a like reason. I have been a solitary dreamer all my days, wrapt up in dim imaginings, strange fantasies, and gleams of all things; so that when I give utterance to the sensations produced on me by the actual vulgar narrow stupid world of realities, you very justly think me on the verge if not past the verge of&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">coma</hi>. But Toleration, man! toleration is all I ask,&#x2014;and what I am ready to give. Do you take your Lipsius, your Crombie, your Schweigh&#xE4;user;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Justus Lipsius (<date when="1547-00-00">1547</date>&#x2013;<date when="1606-00-00">1606</date>), Flemish humanist and classical scholar; Alexander Crombie (<date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), Scottish philologist and schoolmaster; Jean Schweigh&#xE4;user (<date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), French classical philologist.</note> and let me be doing with Lake poets, Mystics, or any trash I can fall in with: why should we not cast an eye of cheering, give a voice of welcome, to each other as our paths become mutually visible, tho&#x2019; they are no longer one.</p>
<p>I meant to give you my history for the byegone months. It is easily done. I have had the most miserable health&#x2014;was in a low fever for two weeks lately, meditating to come home, and actually did elope to Fife; and during all the winter I have had such delightful companions to interrupt my long solitudes, such intellectual, high-spirited men as you have no idea of. My progress has been proportionable. It boots not, as you say, to indulge reproachful afterthoughts. Indeed I have begun to apply the all-consuming maxim <foreign><hi rend="italic">cui bono?</hi></foreign> to study as well as other things; and to ask how can it serve one to be learned and refined and elevate? Is it not to imbibe a feeling of pity for the innocent dolts around one? and of disgust (alas!) at the thistles and furze on which they are faring sumptuously every day? The most enviable thing, I often think, in all the world, must be the soundest of the seven sleepers:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seven Christian youths, said to have hidden in a cave near Ephesus, Asia Minor, during the persecution under Decius (<date when="0249-00-00"><hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi> 249</date>&#x2013;<date when="0251-00-00">51</date>), and to have fallen asleep, awaking two or three hundred years later when Christianity had become established.</note> for he reposes deeply in his corner; and to him the tragi-comedy of life is as painless as it is paltry.&#x2014; But to return&#x2014; I have tried about twenty plans this winter in the way of authorship; they have all failed; I have about twenty more to try: and <hi rend="italic">if</hi> it does but please the Director of all things to continue the moderate share of health now restored to me, I will make the doors of human society fly open before me yet notwithstanding. My petards will not burst, or make only <hi rend="italic">noise</hi> when they do: I must mix them better, plant them more judiciously; they <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> burst and do execution too.&#x2014; But all this, you say, is nothing to the point&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">what</hi> are you doing? Teaching two Dandies mathematics, who leave me (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Io Bacche</hi>!</foreign>) [Hail, Bacchus!] <pb id="pg-01-345" n="01:345"/>in a month; compiling for Encyclopedias (hewing of wood and drawing of water);<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Deut. 29:11.</note> I was translating&#x2014;and am soon to Review. Waugh<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bailie Waugh. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210314-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1821-03-14">14 March</date></ref>.</note> has relented, for his book is reeling like a drunken man,&#x2014;got himself <hi rend="italic">re</hi>-introduced to me, and sent over a book lately&#x2014;Joanna Baillie&#x2019;s Legends. So I beg, Sir, you will view the embryo Aristarchus<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aristarchus of Samothrace (fl. <date>180</date>&#x2013;<date>145 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), editor and scholar.</note> with all the gravity in your power.</p>
<p>But to retort the question, what are <hi rend="italic">you</hi> doing? Are such geniuses as we, think you, to live crammed up as it were in the stocks, pinfolded thus, and shut out from all the cheerful ways of men,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, III, 46.</note> forever? And what are the levers you intend to use? Tell me seriously, and think of it seriously&#x2014;for it demands consideration. I think your classical teaching plan bids fair if you mature it well; and really I would not advise any one to launch, as I was forced to do, upon the roaring deep, so long as he can stay ashore. For me, the surges and the storm are round my skiff; yet I must on&#x2014;on lest biscuit fail me, ere I reach the trade-wind and sail with others.</p>
<p>This I confess is a very pragmatical <hi rend="italic">Frankdixon-ish</hi> way of talking to you: but it is too late now for mending it.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I am rather stupidly inclined to-day; but they have brought me up the box in good time, and I shall darken a sheet of post for you, with all the willingness in the world. I need not say with what satisfaction, I perused your merry frolicksome epistle, or how glad I am to learn that all is going on calmly with you. As times are, one ought to be contented with calmness: meat and drink and freedom would shew like prosperity to many thousands of our brethren, in various countries of Europe.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to the wave of popular, nationalist, and liberal movements which caused disturbances in Spain, Portugal, Piedmont, Naples, and Greece at this time and which inspired the &#x201C;Holy Alliance,&#x201D; a reaction against them.</note> It is matter of comfort, that in spite of all obstructions, you can still keep the Jackall Landlord<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;General&#x201D; Matthew Sharpe, landlord of Mainhill and Hoddam Hill; later, from <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> to <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, M.P. for Dumfries burghs. Brother of Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe. TC is replying to AC&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1821-03-21">21 March</date>.</note> at the staff&#x2019;s end, and meet any of his satellites with an untroubled countenance. No doubt the man needs his revenues; but unless circumstances alter, I fear he will find it requisite to use a stronger <hi rend="italic">lure</hi> next season, before he can raise them all. Dinners with the Laird are powerful things; but they cannot decoy money from an empty purse. However, the Scotsman says that, next year, prices will be high&#x2014;if the cornbill is kept up which it will be&#x2014;and then all will flourish for a space. He is not a prophet or a prophet&#x2019;s son, to be sure; but I could like to believe him this once:&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">once</hi> and no more, for he says that in the subsequent year&#x2014; all will go to pot again, and that agriculture will waver &#x26; <pb id="pg-01-347" n="01:347"/>vibrate and stagger this way perpetually <hi rend="italic">till</hi> the ports are opened and those &#x2018;accursed&#x2019; restrictions on the Corn-trade are abolished forever.</p>
<p>I am also not a little amused at your brief sketches of country news. I sympathize with the love-lorn Irishman&#x2019;s emotions on finding that his pledged bride was of the male gender:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander had written: &#x201C;A remarkable marriage lately at Lockertie [Lockerbie]. an Irishman sick of love meritricious proffered his <foreign>bonny</foreign> hand to a nutbrown servant-maid, but she loved him not, only for his gifts, and had the wedding gown placed on the broad back of a neighbouring apprentis who actually was betrothed to this ill-fated and mortifyed hibernian before the magistrates of Lochmaben.&#x201D;</note> and for the unhappy Pate,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Easton. &#x201C;Peter Easton too was fortunate the other night [Alick wrote]. Mrs Scott&#x2019;s maid had made free with the whisky bottle; was suspected however. Sympson and her Mistress mixed it with julip and other articl<supplied>[e]</supplied>s for purging<supplied>[.]</supplied> The lowlived but presuming Peter with his parymoor took the bait and wer<supplied>[e]</supplied> next morn<supplied>[i]</supplied>ng tremendously opperated upon in various ways as you will guess to, to the fun and sport of us all.&#x201D;</note> with his dose of <foreign>jalap</foreign> [purgative] and whiskey,&#x2014;alas! what tongue can tell his pangs! May they prove a warning to our youth, when similar temptations assail them! You have a lively way of conceiving those things; and your mode of expressing them is getting more &#x26; more perfect. I think in time you cannot fail to acquire a superior style both of penmanship and diction. Continue to practice both the one and the other: there is no plan but this; &#x26; this never fails, if persisted in with attention, to succeed ultimately. By way of encouraging and in part aiding your progress I have sent you old Cobbett&#x2019;s Grammar<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Cobbett (<date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), <hi rend="italic">A Grammar of the English Language</hi> (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>).</note>&#x2014;from which you may I think derive considerable information on the subject of writing, and at all events considerable information as to his political sentiments, which are here expressed in a very singular mode. I got it only to-day, or I would have read it over; for now &#x26; then it tickles one mightily. I hope to find you a <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> grammarian,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a reference to Sandy Beattie, who had examined Carlyle and found him &#x201C;complete in English&#x201D; and therefore ready to go on to Latin. See TC&#x2019;s notes to Althaus&#x2019; biography of Carlyle in German (<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>) in the NLS.</note> when I come to Annandale.</p>
<p>There is not any thing new in my history since last intelligence-day. I am teaching&#x2014;between 8 and 10 o&#x2019;clock in the morning,&#x2014;a task which I believe is to conclude ere long; I saunter about one while, read another, write a third. The Review<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Metrical Legends</hi>&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">New Edinburgh Review</hi> (<date when="1821-10-00">Oct. 1821</date>).</note> you hint at is on the stithy at this date: it would have been finished before this, but some trifling &#x2018;lives&#x2019; for Brewster interposes with a previous claim. I expect little good of the undertaking: but so it yield me nine or ten guineas I shall <pb id="pg-01-348" n="01:348"/>be content. Waugh is very civil; and I am to give him in the article next week. It goes to press immediately.</p>
<p>There was another plan talked of lately&#x2014;for I am full of plans; and tho&#x2019; a hundred fail, I shall continue to hope that the hundred and first will succeed. The worthy provost of Kirkcaldy met me the other day; and stated that he had been concocting a scheme, which he imagines might turn out well for me. It was to take smart and extensive lodgings; to spy about for two or three young &#x2019;squirelings desirous of being educated in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; to admit them under my hired roof, at the rate of (say) 80 or 90 guineas a-head, and thus to remunerate myself for superintending their studies at the College or High School. If the project prospered,&#x2014;to take <hi rend="italic">a house</hi>, and flourish amazingly: he himself had one boy or perhaps two. I promised to consider of this for next afterharvest; but said that being destitute of connexions in a great measure, I had litt<supplied>[l]</supplied>e expectation of getting a suitable number of boys. This did not seem impracticable to the good Magistrate: and he left me with a strict charge to bestir myself, to inquire at least, and let him know the issue.</p>
<p>I have made not <supplied>[no]</supplied> inquiries yet, having been prevented by writing &#x26;c; but really the measure does not seem, on second thoughts, so unfeasible as it did at first. It would involve me in care; but it would not interrupt my literary operations, and it might eventually procure me a home, a hearth-stone of my own&#x2014;which of course I desiderate not a little. And if it go to the winds, as better things have gone before it: what need is there to &#x201C;whine, put finger i' the eye and sob&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This quotation is extended in &#x201C;Sir Walter Scott,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 73.

Give me a sound body, and a free conscience; and I fear nothing.</p>
<p>My dear boy, I said I was stupid; and now I have proved it. You must send me more of your meditations&#x2014;on religion or love&#x2014;or whatever the subject is: I like them well.&#x2014; <closer><salute>I am always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mitchell,</salute>
<p>Your pupil George John having it in view to proceed shortly home again to Ruthwell, you cannot be surprised that I seize the opportunity which this circumstance affords me to disport a little in the way of innocent chat with you&#x2014;and relieve my solitude by an <hi rend="italic">emblem</hi> of society, since I cannot get the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> article to my mind. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Le plus grand des plaisirs, c'est l'abandon de soi-m&#xEA;me</hi></foreign> [The greatest of pleasures is the abandonment of self]: in order to enjoy it however imperfectly, I have kicked out the frolicksome Christopher North,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The pseudonym of John Wilson in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s</hi>.</note> and the &#x2018;Monthly&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi> was originally entitled the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Monthly Magazine</hi>.</note>&#x2014;in spite of its paralytic affections,&#x2014;with a host of other <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ecrivassiers</hi></foreign> [scribblers], who have beset me all day, and confused me with their incessant &#x26; unmusical hubbub&#x2014;driving all old thoughts away, and putting no new one in their room.</p>
<p>It is natural for you to expect that seeing I have volunteered a letter, I must needs have some important news to tell you&#x2014;something fresh in the literary world, or at least something very strange in my own poor history. Neither of your suppositions is correct. The literary world is going on much as it was wont: frisking Reviewers come forth once a quarter, tipsy Magazine-men once a month; both as usual,</p>
<lg><l>Trip it as they go</l>
<l>On the light fantastic toe,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;L'Allegro,&#x201D; II. 33&#x2013;34.</note></l></lg>
<p>and see around them a nameless throng, digging like moles at Encyclopedias, Journals, Monthly Reviews &#x26;c &#x26;c quite in the old stile. Nor has any thing particular happened to myself since I wrote last to you. I am moving on, weary &#x26; heavy laden, with very fickle health, and many discomforts&#x2014;still looking forward to the future (brave future!) for all the accommodations and enjoyments that render life an object of desire. <hi rend="italic">Then</hi> shall I no longer play a candle-snuffer&#x2019;s part in the Great Drama; or if I do my salary will be raised: <hi rend="italic">then</hi> shall&#x2014;which you see is just &#x2018;use and wont.&#x2019;</p>

By &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">the</hi> long positive prescription&#x2019; they have acquired a kind of right to live, and they exercise it quietly&#x2014;travelling about the city to diffuse the knowledge of Ruddiman and the Horn Book,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Ruddiman (<date when="1674-00-00">1674</date>&#x2013;<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>), Scottish grammarian and philologist.</note> consuming a stated, stinted portion of indifferent whisky punch&#x2014;scenting every breeze for <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> parsons&#x2014;and trusting that Providence will not continue blind to merit <hi rend="italic">always</hi>. Such are the nascent pillars of our venerable Church. I see few of them, and desire to see still fewer. Murray is here, with <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Galloway History. Upon the whole, Murray is among the best of them.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I had just concluded the first meal of the day now passing over me,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230728-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-07-28">28 July 1823</date></ref>.</note> when a tall wench interrupted my reflections, by lugging in that respectable box&#x2014;the sight of which never fails to inspire me with agreeable ideas of various kinds. It gives me promise not only of substantial accom<supplied>[m]</supplied>odations for the outward man, but also of intelligence refreshing for the inward man, and it holds out the prospect &#x2018;of an hour or two&#x2019; to be spent agreeably in transmitting intelligence from myself in return. The second gratification I have already enjoyed; the first is certainly in store for me; and the last, you see, I am purposing to make sure of without delay.</p>
<p>Your sheet (the first real <hi rend="italic">sheet</hi> of a long time) is well filled and pleasantly. Cobbett &#x2018;triple-turned Renegade&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An expression of Alick&#x2019;s, in his letter of <date when="1821-04-07">7 April</date>, presumably referring to his twice having retreated to America and then having returned to England.</note> tho&#x2019; he be&#x2014;will not I am persuaded be unfruitful in your hands: by <hi rend="italic">turning</hi> him over patiently as liesure serves, you cannot fail to acquire a substantial knowledge of Grammar; your <hi rend="italic">hand of write</hi> is very considerably improved, as well as your orthography, and both will go on improving still farther. Practice is the only road to Perfection, in this art as in others; and you cannot have a better opportunity of travelling it, than my necessities hold out to you at present. Continue to epistolize me diligently. Write concerning all matters that cross your &#x2018;mental <hi rend="italic">veeshon</hi>&#x2019;; give me a true picture of your state and situation&#x2014;outward and domestic; you can tell me nothing that will not be interesting. I would not be unreasonable, however; I daresay you are very busy at this period,&#x2014;tilling the soil&#x2014;for potatoes, or harrowing it over corn, or <hi rend="italic">fallowing</hi> it, or doing twenty things beside: so I do not look for such minute and comprehensive dispatches yet, as I shall get by and by. <pb id="pg-01-352" n="01:352"/>Only be as liberal as you can; do not fail to give me <hi rend="italic">something</hi>, and I shall be satisfied.</p>
<p>There is nothing different in my condition, since I wrote last to you. The Review I finished eight days ago, and gave to Waugh directly: I understand it is to be printed in due course. Something however there seems to be requiring discussion connected with it. Waugh told me yesterday, that <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Editor Dr Poole, <hi rend="italic">thawt viry</hi> highly of <hi rend="italic">eet</hi>; and wished to see me at tea to-night for the purpose of talking about it. I am going accordingly. I suppose it is too long; for their book is small, and I was copious at the time. Dr Poole shall have leave (Heaven bless him!) to make &#x2018;a kirk and a mill&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Scottish saying: &#x201C;to do as he likes with it.&#x201D; Dr. Poole has not been definitely identified, but a Dr. Richard Poole, M.D., who had graduated from St. Andrews in <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>, became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>.</note> of the thing if he likes&#x2014;so his principal do but table me a reasonable quantum of cash for my duty. I imagine it possible that some benefit may arise to me from this undertaking. The present article is very wretched certainly: but if it induce them to give me more&#x2014;of an agreeable stamp&#x2014;I should find little difficulty, while in health, of throwing of<supplied>[f]</supplied> a sheet or so of letter-press for them monthly; from which would arise a neat little sum&#x2014;sufficient to maintain me snugly throughout the whole year, and leave me room besides to prosecute such other objects as I might incline. With health, I certainly fear nothing: and health I trust may be served by due attention. As to the Provost&#x2019;s scheme, I think it may perhaps turn to something beneficial after all. I have written about it to Irving; and design to mention it to some others. Perhaps I might contrive to get&#x2014;say four boys; it would keep me beyond danger of want&#x2014;of itself; and then I have fair scope in other directions.</p>
<p>We must all fight and fight&#x2014;if we would live in this world. I often think they are happier that fight for solid necessary objects, than they that vex themselves in vain for dainty cates to satisfy the boundless cravings of a spirit left unoccupied. To see them hunting and drinking and debauching all ways; dancing, dressing, strutting&#x2014;not to mention your great conquerors and projectors of various sorts&#x2014;alas! the mind is languid and tempest-tossed and discontented, do what they will. Your husbandman keeps hold of Health any way; and I tell you the possession of that bright blessing is better than the empire of the world. If you could penetrate into the hearts of our poor shambling lairds&#x2014;whether they be dandies or jolly ones, and see the yellowness and flatness of their inward landscape; you would fly with double speed back to your fresh fields and bracing air; gladly forsaking the switch and quizzer and other <foreign><hi rend="italic">plaiks</hi></foreign> [toys] invented by French <pb id="pg-01-353" n="01:353"/>barbers and the like, for the venerable plough&#x2014;invented by Father Adam himself, and dignified by the usage of patriarchs and heroes, and still better dignified intrinsically as the Upholder of the human race.&#x2014; But a truce with Philosophy&#x2014; There is no room for her here.&#x2014; Do you hear any thing about Jamie Johnstone of late? I have enquired often but without success. Tell me next time: and <hi rend="italic">collect</hi> news for me from all parts, no matter how <hi rend="italic">empty</hi>&#x2014; I rejoice over the library,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ecclefechan Library, which Alick reported had just received <hi rend="italic">Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa</hi> (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>) by Mungo Park (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>), and &#x201C;the whole of William Robertson&#x2019;s works.&#x201D; He did not elaborate on the nature of the opposition to it. TC wrote an article on Mungo Park for the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</hi>.</note> and its new chance of existence.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Supposing that you are now returned from Liverpool, and at leisure to think of our small epistolary concerns, I propose this evening to give myself the gratification of replying in some sort to your very kind and agreeable letter of last month. I well remember the day when it arrived, and how sweetly its contents harmonized with the strong Congou I was drinking at the time; a fresh perusal has this moment renewed my pleasure, and I have too much of self-love in me to &#x201C;disappoint&#x201D; or delay satisfying the wish with which you conclude. Indeed so fond am I of scribbling to you, that, as Hope can bear witness, I firmly purposed to charge him with a <hi rend="italic">supererogatory</hi> sheet last time he was here: which purpose I effected to a nearness&#x2014;being only about ten minutes behind the appointed or rather probable hour of Hope&#x2019;s departure;&#x2014;a slight miscalculation, but one which saved you the fatigue of reading some nonsense, and supplied me with three leaves of excellent paper to light cigars with.</p>
<p>So you observe, I will not listen with any degree of patience to <pb id="pg-01-354" n="01:354"/>those accusations&#x2014;which, with a zeal that would not shame the Attorney General himself, you bring forward against our correspondence, and your own powers for supporting it. No, Sir! It is enough, that in a world so full of vanities, a letter to or from you never fails to bring enjoyment with it: and therefore, doubt not, I shall write whenever <foreign><hi rend="italic">my ain di'el</hi></foreign> [my own devil] <hi rend="italic">bids me</hi>, earnestly entreating <hi rend="italic">your di'el</hi> to be condescending enough to go and do likewise. Nay more, if you object to this, or say another word about barrenness and so forth&#x2014;I protest the next letter shall contain a <hi rend="italic">philosophical</hi> disquisition on the nature of letter writing in general, setting forth the advantages to be derived from your correspondence and the utility of your letters to me, with a copiousness, not to say prolixity, sufficient to strike all gainsayers, and <hi rend="italic">for</hi>sayers too, with astonishment and paleness of countenance. A word to the wise. Whenever you feel disposed to do me a real favour, sit down and write me a long epistle,&#x2014;full of whatever comes uppermost; to be sure of a similar epistle in return; and so the transaction <hi rend="italic">be</hi> in fact attended with a true and harmless pleasure, never mind the <hi rend="italic">how</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">wherefore</hi>.</p>
<p>I need not say with what interest I listen to the opening intelligence, which I am favoured with, in regard to the state of your worldly affairs or the spirit with which you endure their perplexing embarrassments. It were, of course, vain or worse to enter deeply on a subject, where I have so little power to advise, and where my heartfelt <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to do it is already so well understood. But while I again fearlessly recommend you to the fountain of Hope, the genuine perennial <hi rend="italic">spa</hi> for all diseases of the soul, and which none but the Guilty in conscience are forbidden to taste; I can see many ways in which this period of inaction&#x2014;now so painful&#x2014;might be alleviated and rendered profitable. Why do you not, for instance, embark in a vigorous course of reading? Do not think me impertinent: but what is to hinder you, I would ask, from nobly redeeming the time which at present hangs so heavy on your hands? There are all Robertson&#x2019;s histories and Hume&#x2019;s&#x2014;if you have not read them; there are Russell&#x2019;s Modern Europe to begin with, and Watson&#x2019;s Philip II &#x26; III, with all their Dutch revolutions and Bohemian wars, and Coxe&#x2019;s Austrian and Spanish Bourbons and I wot not who, for foreign countries; and Clarendon and Burnet and Laing and Hailes and Pinkerton and all the rest, for our own.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Certainly a formidable reading list, a great part of which Carlyle was to recommend to Jane Welsh in his letter to her of <date when="1821-06-04">4 June</date>.

Cast off those sombre thoughts&#x2014;the properties of which I know but too minutely; surround yourself with maps and chronologies and narratives, and mingle with the bright spirits of former ages&#x2014;enter into their &#x2018;business and their bosoms&#x2019;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Bacon&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>, Dedication.</note> the concentrated essence of the past will entice you from the weary insipidity of the present. I seriously wish you would consider this. It is surprising to think how much improvement and enjoyment is held out in history to every man of sense, and held out only to be neglected by nine hundred and ninety nine out of the thousand. In half a year, you may have all the memorable events of the modern world impressed upon your memory; and then, what a field for reflection and imagination and mental activity of every kind! Heaven knows I do not want to make you a literary character: but there is a peculiar value in knowledge, different (and higher) in its species from the value of gold or silver; and while your implements for the latter are yet entangled and for a time unmanageable, why should you not grasp the implements for attaining the former, and use them stoutly,&#x2014;above all, when the very attempt will be degrees fill up the vacancy of your mind and expel the tedium that afflicts you? This you will say is a poor resource. No matter: try it, persevere in it; you will find it becomes more effectual as you continue to apply it. Tell me what you think of it, at least: I promise to answer all objections.</p>
<p>How vain are the schemes of mortal man! I did design to give you a most luminous account of my whole walk and conversation; to hold a miniature as it were of all the &#x2018;passing shews of being&#x2019; that chequer this my obscure scene, from day to day; and see! I am on the wrong side of my last leaf, and not a word said about the matter! You must just write to me again, &#x26; get an answer immediately. At the <pb id="pg-01-356" n="01:356"/>present I can only say that things are much as they were when I saw you. I intend to pass the summer here&#x2014;in the old way. My health is the most precarious capricious thing imaginable: I have not been well for one day since last Autumn&#x2014;sometimes very sick. Nevertheless, I trust the &#x2018;Animal Economy&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Shaftesbury&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Characteristicks</hi>: &#x201C;an animal order or oeconomy, according to which animal affairs are regulated and disposed.&#x201D;</note> (of which I know exceedingly little) will have the goodness, some time soon, to bring matters to a crisis&#x2014;either to free itself from this drawling languor and go on honestly, or else to give up the cause for good and all. A free course or a quietus&#x2014;if it so please Providence!&#x2014; What is Irving doing? A creature told me he was to get Hamilton Church; another that Meek<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Meek (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), ordained <date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>, went to Hamilton Church in <date when="1821-11-00">Nov. 1821</date>, where he remained until his death. Irving wrote Carlyle, <date when="1821-04-26">26 April</date>: &#x201C;Kinfauns went to one better backed, and Hamilton went to one earlier promised, and I am here as formerly not once having devoted a thought to either disappointment.&#x201D; His remarks are a mixture of chagrin and virtuous resignation.</note> was to get it. Will you write soon?</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have but a very little time to dash you off a few lines; but I cannot resist the temptation to employ it in a way which I know will be so agreeable to you, and which I feel to be so agre<supplied>[e]</supplied>able to myself&#x2014;</p>
<p>That small copperplate I beg you to accept in a quiet manner, saying not a word about the matter to any living soul; but get tea and other tackle with it, <hi rend="italic">and for my sake</hi>. Nothing can delight me more than the hope of being able to contribute to your happiness. I entreat you most vehemently to be in want of nothing that I can supply you with. Not rich yet&#x2014;I have wherewith to meet the passing hour; and I feel that &#x2018;the little which a just man hath&#x2019; must be beyond all comparison preferable to the filled garners of the wicked.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This may be a paraphrase of &#x201C;a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked&#x201D; (Ps. 37:16).</note> Do you think so also; (I need not bid you): and take this as the widow&#x2019;s mite&#x2014;not &#x2018;all that I have&#x2019;&#x2014;or any thing like it&#x2014;but given as fervently.</p>
 <p>I was in to look at <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Synod today. It was very unintelligible to me. I could hear little and understand less. There was a medley of <pb id="pg-01-357" n="01:357"/>burghers and anti-burghers&#x2014;all sitting promise<supplied>[u]</supplied>ously&#x2014;some speaking, some listening, some not listening, as usual in such cases. Few of them were known to me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Seceders left the Church of Scotland in the <date when="1730-00-00">1730</date>&#x2019;s over the question of lay patronage; in <date when="1747-00-00">1747</date> they were themselves split by the application of a &#x201C;Burgess Oath,&#x201D; which was taken to imply acceptance of the Church of Scotland&#x2019;s system of patronage. Those refusing the oath formed the &#x201C;Antiburgher,&#x201D; those accepting, the &#x201C;Burgher&#x201D; Church, and remained separate until their union in <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date> as the United Secession Church.</note> Yet there was the withered visage of Walter Bell&#x2014;the farthing-face of Young; and I saw the creature Brash,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably George Young (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), theologian, topographer, geologist (see <ref target="volume-01/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30262"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); and William Brash (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), minister of Sydney Place Burgher Church, Glasgow (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">50</date>). Brash had also been called to Ecclefechan but preferred Glasgow.</note> shaking hands with all and sundry of the brethren within reach of him. It is interesting, very interesting to see the decay of pharasaical principles. I rejoice to behold so many worthy characters&#x2014;casting off the old man<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Col. 3:9.</note>&#x2014;laying down their miserable squabbles&#x2014;and uniting in the good cause with all their heart, where all good men will join them.</p>
<p>Farther than this Synod-meeting, of which I can say so little, there is nothing here almost that you would feel much care about. Dr Lawson on the Proverbs is published, I observe. Tell me pointedly if you would like to see it. I can get it easily.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Lawson (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>) may have been known to the Carlyles, since he had studied under John Johnstone, secession minister at Ecclefechan, during vacations. His <hi rend="italic">Exposition of the Book of Proverbs</hi> was published in <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>. He became professor of theology in the associate secession (Burgher) Church of Scotland, <date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>; and he is said to have known the Scriptures by heart and to have been the original of Josiah Cargill in Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">St. Ronan&#x2019;s Well</hi>. Mrs. Carlyle replied that the book would be too costly and that she would have nothing to do with it.</note></p>
<p>I have no time or space to enter upon the state of my affairs at present. They are in a fair kind of way; much as usual. My health is not to complain of (<hi rend="italic">how</hi> is yours?): I swallow pills and salts and stuff; and hope great things from the sea bathin<supplied>[g]</supplied> which I design to practice soon.</p>
<p>Will you find time to write next opportunity? Give my love to all the little <hi rend="italic">childer</hi>, Jenny, Jane, Mary<supplied>[,]</supplied> James &#x26; Mag. <closer><salute>I am ever,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have studied it and find you must again be contented with a half-sheet: my time is short, and my task is great in proportion to it. I read over your little letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1821-05-09">9 May 1821</date>.</note> with such feelings as all your letters inspire in me, enlivened in the present case by the assurance that your health is tolerable and your mind comfortable. My dear Mother, I trust Providence will long bountifully continue those blessings to us&#x2014;for it is to us more than to yourself that they are valuable.</p>
<p>You need not doubt that I shall find employment for your generous anxiety to serve me:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Carlyle had written: &#x201C;But in return tell me of all your little wants perhaps I could sup<supplied>[p]</supplied>ly some of them.&#x201D;</note> indeed you can hardly require more employment, I think, than what you find in those lots of clothes and stuff that I am ever sending home to busy you with. These are <foreign><hi rend="italic">bra'</hi></foreign> [fine] white socks, but really I needed them not. And what shall I say of the cakes? What but that I have mumbled over fragments of them all the afternoon? I suppose you put liberal allowances of butter in the dough&#x2014;they are so much preferable, not to the last sample, but to the one before it. As for the butter, it is most welcome. I have been, not on short but precarious allowance for some time. Once my fortune was to get a good sweet article&#x2014;more frequently since, it has been tasteless or tasting only of the various intermediate flavours between sourness and stench. I am in funds now.&#x2014; Many thanks also, my good Mother, for your bundles of camomile.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Carlyle had written: &#x201C;I have sent you a few cammile fl<supplied>[o]</supplied>wers<supplied>[.]</supplied> I understand they are a good thing for the Stomack<supplied>[;]</supplied> draw them like tea and take a draught every marning &#x2026; and I wish a blissing along with it.&#x201D;</note> I have laid it by in my trunk, and whether it help the stomach or not, it cannot fail to help the <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> every time I look at it. My disorders are not, however, in general severe: and when they do appear (it is only from carelessness), they arise from bile and trash&#x2014;over which herbs have no power. In fact tho&#x2019; I work on with Doctors&#x2019; stuff yet occasionally, I cannot complain; I am what you would call &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">no that ill ava</hi></foreign>&#x2019; <supplied>[not so ill at all]</supplied>. I tried the bathing three times with good effect; but the stormy weather has intervened for a week. The sea <pb id="pg-01-359" n="01:359"/>will cure me doubtless. But alas! see how soon our little chit-chat is over&#x2014;and I must take my leave. We shall meet in <date when="1821-08-00">August</date>&#x2014; Pray that it be in peace and comfort. <closer><salute>Good night, my dear Mother</salute></closer></p>

This is Carlyle&#x2019;s first letter to Jane Welsh. He had returned from Haddington and his first visit to the Welshes just four days before. Irving remained a welcome visitor at the Welsh household after he ceased to tutor in it. On this occasion he had taken with him Carlyle, who, although awkward and very bilious, had attracted Jane Welsh&#x2019;s attention.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>If, on opening this paper, you expect to find any traces of that much vaunted <hi rend="italic">list</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The reading list which he seems to have promised her.</note> you are about to be somewhat disappointed. Since quitting East Lothian, I have been so little in a condition to collect my ideas, or think seriously about any thing; and it seems withal so presumptuous an attempt in me to act as your tutor at present,&#x2014;that really you must excuse me for a while. Besides&#x2014;unless Fortune treat me even worse than usual&#x2014;I am destined in process of time to know you far more intimately, and so to become far better qualified for contributing advantageously what little is mine to your improvement. Any way, you cannot be at a loss for employment till winter. Robertson and Hume (to be studied with the aid of maps and chronologies and so forth); Watson&#x2019;s Philip II &#x26; Philip III; Russel&#x2019;s Modern Europe; Voltaire&#x2019;s pretty little histories; with occasional excursions in the company of Tasso and De Sta&#xEB;l&#x2014;will amply fill up the summer, and very profitably also.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Very much the same list that Carlyle had given Graham. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210424-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1821-04-24">24 April</date></ref>. But here Carlyle adds Voltaire (<date when="1694-00-00">1694</date>&#x2013;<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>), whose histories include: <hi rend="italic">Histoire de Charles XII</hi> (<date when="1731-00-00">1731</date>), <hi rend="italic">L'Empire de Russie sous Pierre le Grand</hi> (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1765-00-00">65</date>), and <hi rend="italic">Le Si&#xE8;cle de Louis XIV</hi> (<date when="1751-00-00">1751</date>); Torquato Tasso (<date when="1544-00-00">1544</date>&#x2013;<date when="1595-00-00">95</date>), whose <hi rend="italic">Gerusalemme Liberata</hi> Carlyle read in <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>; and Anne Louise Germaine Necker, Mme de Sta&#xEB;l (<date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>).</note> Observe you are not to read <hi rend="italic">much</hi>: not for the gallant Captain&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the &#x201C;gallant Captain&#x201D; was one of Jane&#x2019;s friends who, like the &#x201C;Philistine&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>, liked to declaim against higher education for women.</note> reason; but because it will prejudice your health&#x2014;which I will not allow you ever to endanger on any account.</p>

Be patient, however: should the military Musician<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the &#x201C;gallant Captain&#x201D; again, who appears to have stood in Carlyle&#x2019;s way for the moment.</note> have &#x2018;taken a giddiness&#x2019; and shifted his quarters before that period, I protest I would not give a penny (or rather I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> give many, many) to come eastward as far as Haddington myself, and deliver such a lesson on those Saxon roots as you never heard. Positively, I must see you soon&#x2014;or I shall get into a very absurd state. And then if I should come to visit Jane herself <hi rend="italic">professedly</hi>; <hi rend="italic">what</hi> would Jane say to it? What would Jane&#x2019;s friends say? Would to Heaven some authorized person would &#x2018;force me to go voluntarily!&#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Force me to go voluntarily&#x201D; was a phrase attributed by Carlyle to Joseph Bonaparte.

<p>But I forget. It is not of my own concerns, it is of yours I have to write at present. And therefore it is time to introduce the books to your notice, which have caused all this scribbling. The <hi rend="italic">Germany</hi>,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mme de Sta&#xEB;l&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">De L'Allemagne</hi> (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>).</note> except the first volume, I cannot get&#x2014;at least for a day or two. The other will perhaps interest you more, at any rate:&#x2014; There is no hurry in returning either.&#x2014; I hope you will like Mad. de Sta&#xEB;l. She is misty and inconsistent here and there, it is true; she has none of that sprightliness, that bland and sparkling wit, which so gracefully adorns the higher qualities of a young lady I once met with: but if a brilliant imagination, a magnificent intellect, a noble heart, can yield you any delight; then here is for you! Professors of Divinity and other old women think poor Wilhelmina<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle may have given Mme de Sta&#xEB;l the wrong name. It is used again in later letters.</note> crazy,&#x2014;which is all very just and natural.</p>
<p>Now when you have read these volumes, I pray you to consider if it would be quite contrary to Law&#x2014;&#x2018;clean again rules&#x2019; (as the creature Dougal phrased it)<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Rob Roy</hi> (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>). Dougal, acting as turnkey at the Tolbooth Prison, uses the phrase when he is aroused to open the door.</note>&#x2014;to tell me in three words what you think of the Lady de Sta&#xEB;l; to say whether, her cousin, the Lady Jane is well and happy; and whether the latter has ever deigned to cast one glance of recollection on those few Elysian hours we spent together lately? Certainly this seems a very simple matter in itself; and taking into view the satisfaction it will confer on a fellow-creature I do not see <pb id="pg-01-361" n="01:361"/>how you can spend a half-hour better than in performing it. No doubt you may refuse me; you may even forbid me to repeat such questions, however nearly the answer concern me. But it will be <hi rend="italic">very</hi> cruel if you do: and even then there will be one unalienable comfort left me&#x2014;the comfort, that, no man, woman or child can hinder me to cherish &#x2018;within the secret cell of the heart,&#x2019; as long and as tenderly as I please, those sentiments of deep and affectionate interest, which I have thought meet to conceive towards you. Here I am a perfect Sultan, absolute as the Great Solyman<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Suleiman the Magnificent (<date when="1494-00-00">1494</date>&#x2013;<date when="1566-00-00">1566</date>).</note> himself.</p>
<p>But alas! three o&#x2019;clock is at hand; and this wonderful compound of pedagogy and sentimentality and absurdity must conclude. Excuse my impertinences. You see I never dream of remembering, that, we have not yet been <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> twenty years acquainted. It seems as if we had known each other from infancy upwards, and I were simply your elder Brother. You would cut me to the quick of the heart, if you took offence at this.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Your letter came most opportunely to relieve my anxieties on your account, and also to employ two hours of otherwise unprofitable time in answering it. I swallowed a huge dose of Epsom salt (horrible drug!), which has freed me from some qualms, indeed; but rendered me as weak for the time&#x2014;it was yesterday when I did the deed&#x2014;as any man need well be. So if not in writing to you, I must have spent the afternoon in vague dreaming,&#x2014;stretched upon three chairs, and wrapped carefully up in Grahame&#x2019;s impenetrable dreadnought cloak. <pb id="pg-01-362" n="01:362"/>If the boy had come a little earlier, it had been better: but three o&#x2019;clock seems to be his favourite hour.</p>
<p>I sighed to learn the fate of poor old Rose. She was a good beast in her day; but beasts are mortal as well as men; and like Cato&#x2019;s son, our Rose &#x201C;has done her duty.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps an allusion to the account of the son of Cato the Younger in Plutarch&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi> (North&#x2019;s translation), who after his father&#x2019;s death though &#x201C;idlely given and lascivious besides,&#x201D; later acquitted himself in his fight against Octavius Caesar and Antony at Philippi, where he died bravely.</note> She has seen you thro&#x2019; the seed-time;&#x2014;which, if I may judge from personal experience here, must have been a task more than usually heavy. We have had <hi rend="italic">such</hi> weather! Ever since may began, a Whirlblast and a Drench, a Whirlblast and a Drench, have been our sad vicissitudes. Yesterday was a day of darkness; but it set the wind into the West&#x2014;where I solemnly pray it may continue as long as&#x2014;possible. Those easterly breezes, with their fine freights (of icy vapour, sand, straw, dung &#x26;c, here) are certainly the most entertaining weather one can well fall in with. If you be indigestive and nervous at the time,&#x2014;it is quite surprising.</p>
<p>No wish has arisen within me more constantly and fervently for the last half-year, than the wish for a return of sound, vig<supplied>[or]</supplied>ous health. I tell you, my boy, all the evils of life are as the small dust of the balance to a diseased stomach. Rejoice that your chosen occupation, with all its many toils and difficulties, will ever preserve you free from such miserable experience. It is not the <hi rend="italic">pain</hi> of those capricious organs; that were little: but the irresistible depression, the gloomy overclouding of the soul, which they inevitably engender, is truly frightful&#x2014;at least to a Solitary it is frightful. Upon this dreadful property of bowel disorders it is, however, that I mainly ground my expectation of a final recovery. The external pain has not abated very decidedly; but my spirits have not been so good for many years, as during the last month or two. Therefore I do trust by bathing, and walking, and every kind of attention&#x2014;once more to taste the feelings of a <hi rend="italic">whole man. If</hi> it were but so!&#x2014;I would not give a straw for all the earth&#x2014;except those I liked.</p>
<p>No doubt it is <hi rend="italic">the Salt</hi> which speaketh here&#x2014;partly&#x2014;for in very deed I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> getting better. Dr Brewster maintained that I had been in the country to recover so ruddy a check, when he saw me a while ago. I am stronger, too, in my general mood. Therefore I pray you to have Dumple fitly caparisoned against the month of <date when="1821-08-00">August</date>; for this genial warning shall not be lost, undoubtedly; and I shall ri<supplied>[de]</supplied> on <pb id="pg-01-363" n="01:363"/>that formidable steed&#x2014;if I were home&#x2014;from morning unto night. The wandering Jew himself shall not be a more restless character.</p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>But for some such opportunity as Irving&#x2019;s parcel affords, I should never have thought of disturbing your repose today; when biliousness and nervousness and sadness and dullness have brought me within a few degrees of absolute zero, in the scale of men. I am about as fit to write as &#x201C;dog distract or monkey sick&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi>, I, i, 212.</note> would be. Nevertheless I cannot omit to express the high satisfaction I derived from perusing your long, humourous and all too kind letter: and tho&#x2019; I know these preliminary <pb id="pg-01-364" n="01:364"/>excuses of mine will be looked upon as the preamble of bad singers,&#x2014;whose liability to catch cold has long been proverbial; still I must onward and obey my stars; for it has stood written on &#x201C;the iron leaf&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified, but see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230414-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-04-14">14 April 1823</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;as you may see&#x2014;that on this <date when="1821-06-12">twelfth of June</date>, above all other days, I should extend my nightmare influence even to the city of Glasgow, and to a burgher of it who deserved from me a far different service.</p>
<p>It was not without a lively pleasure that I followed your graphical description of the tour to Fintrey.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fintrey is a parish and village southwest of Stirling. The ruined castle there was a stronghold of the Grahams. The &#x201C;parson&#x201D; or minister was John Graham, M.A. (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>), minister at Fintrey from <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date> to <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>, who was presented to the church by the Duke of Montrose, also a Graham.</note> I hope in time to know the good parson of the place; but I can scarcely hope (not being of the clan-Grahame) to participate in the feelings of astonished curiosity which you must have experienced at sight of those long massy spokes of flesh<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham had commented on Edward Irving&#x2019;s long legs.</note> projected from the <hi rend="italic">brief</hi> hammock of our friend, whose lamentable case I have often since contemplated in vision with a keen sympathy. The &#x201C;roof and rafters,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Burns, &#x201C;Tam o' Shanter,&#x201D; l. 124.</note> too!&#x2014;poor rafters!&#x2014;but then their quaking was only for a time; they deserve less pity. Certainly I shall go to visit Dundaff;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dundaff, a range of hills in Stirlingshire, had formerly belonged to the Grahams.</note> and execrate as deeply as I can, the low rat-catcher who now profanes the Keep of my early friend Sir John the Graham.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Graham presumes that this is Sir James Graham. It is more likely Sir John Graham (d. <date when="1298-00-00">1298</date>), a supporter of William Wallace killed at the Battle of Falkirk. He is mentioned in Blind Harry&#x2019;s poem, which Carlyle refers to. William Graham&#x2019;s letter mentions &#x201C;my gallant Clansman, Sir John the Graham.&#x201D;</note> I recollect him well&#x2014;the tight, little, true hearted fellow. At the age of seven I scraped acquaintance with him&#x2014;when perched upon honest Jamie Beattie&#x2019;s<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably an Ecclefechan weaver.</note> loom, I yelled forth the hymns of Blind Harry,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blind Harry or Henry the Minstrel (fl. <date when="1470-00-00">1470</date>&#x2013;<date when="1492-00-00">92</date>) was the author of a long poem, <hi rend="italic">Schir William Wallace</hi>. Carlyle presumably meant that he sang popular ballads.</note> from my small lungs, with the voice and spirit of a sybil&#x2014;to overcome the jingling racket of four shuttles and twice as many treadles: and tho&#x2019; I <hi rend="italic">reverenced</hi> the Laird of Ellerslie<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir William Wallace. Ellerslie or Elderslie is the land of the Wallace family near Paisley in Renfrewshire. It was probably Wallace&#x2019;s birthplace.</note> the most, his faithful squire came nearest to my heart. You shall buy Dundaff undoubtedly, and make a smart affair of it too, in due season. I will even let you <hi rend="italic">entail</hi> it&#x2014;if you be a <foreign><hi rend="italic">guid bairn</hi></foreign>: but all depends upon that.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-365" n="01:365"/>The excellent Irving delights in making all about him happy: a miserable creature in his neighbourhood is to him like a disease of his own. He came here lately to try his hand upon me; and so East Lothian was the world.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is referring to the visit to Haddington in East Lothian on which he first met Jane Welsh.</note> I need not describe this excursion. The Palinurus<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pilot of Aeneas&#x2019; ship. Edward Irving had guided the misanthropic Carlyle to a happy haven at Haddington.</note> himself will have told you how sick I was, what work he had to overcome my taciturnity, and then how captious and sophistical I grew, and withal how happy. This world, I am told, is all a scene of illusions: pity that it is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> so! Since my return, I have been busily engaged in that important thing, Doing nothing. It is so fine to wrap yourself up in the bright bespangled webs of the Imagination, to let the good creature have care of you herself, and rock you and lull you as she lists! Prudence &#x201C;her choppy finger laying on her skinny lips&#x201D;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, I, iii.</note> looks wonderfully grave at this. She need not: all is over soon; a few short hours, and the dull, grating din of this low world awakes you from your trance, and changes all the purple of fiction into the grey <hi rend="italic">plaiden</hi><note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A coarse woollen twilled cloth. An early use of the clothes symbol.</note> of reality. Prudence may save herself the pains.</p>
<p>It is very friendly in you to keep so sharp an eye upon <hi rend="italic">the</hi> book. But alas! my dear Sir, do but consider. How am I, poor grasshopper as I am, to make my small chick be heard, among the many Bulls of Bashan<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Ps. 22:12&#x2013;13; Deut. 3:13. Bashan was called the land of giants.</note> that on every side fill the vallies with their lowing? The thing is barely possible, if I had health and friends and capital&#x2014;all of which I want. At the present my ideas are like a flock of geese, which a man was driving orderly, with a long pole and bladder half-full of peas at the end of it, across some common, to the Market;&#x2014;when lo! Dyspepsia, the ugly ragged trull, comes hallooing into the midst of them, and scatters the poor geese to the four winds&#x2014;gather them again who will! It is a hard case, in fact, this same distemper. A malady of the soul one can embellish and dignify a little by enduring: but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> carries with it the indellible stamp of nastiness and lowness; do what we may, it seems to pollute the very sanctuary of our being; it renders our suffering at once complete and contemptible. The invisible mind, you say, can dignify anything. Condemn Cato to keep the college Infernals clean&#x2014;and look for his dignity then! I believe I am destined to get better, however, or surely it were uphill work with me at present. I am far happier for the last three months; so I abide in hope, and <pb id="pg-01-366" n="01:366"/>in the meantime I live idly and &#x201C;trifle with life&#x2019;s falling leaf&#x201D;<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;To gambol with life&#x2019;s falling leaf&#x201D; (Wordsworth, &#x201C;The Kitten and Falling Leaves,&#x201D; l. 128).</note>&#x2014;as best I can. There are books to read; and things to write (<hi rend="italic">such</hi> things!) but I mind not that. Life is but a kind of tragicomedy at best: If I play a mute&#x2019;s part in it, what matter. The Great Scene-shifter will hush up all, in a little while. Then &#x201C;hoity-toity!&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">where</hi> is the Emperor? Where is the shoeblack?

<p>I am to see you about the <date when="1821-08-01">first of August</date>, and discuss all things with you, I hope. It is a heartfelt pleasure to me to learn that your affairs begin to wear a better aspect: I knew it would be so. These storms which have been and still are so hard to bear, will do you good in the long run. Adversity <hi rend="italic">is</hi> useful sometimes&#x2014;in spite of all the foolish stuff they have preached in favour of it. <closer><salute>May it prove so with you&#x2014;may it drive from your heart nothing but what has a right to be there&#x2014;above all not the friendship with which you honour,</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>Recollect I am to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> you in <date when="1821-08-00">August</date>: to hear from you long long before.

<salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
<p>It would have been a pleasant spectacle for Mephistophiles or any of his sooty brethren,&#x2014;in whose eyes, I understand, this restless life of ours appears like a regular Farce, only somewhat dull at times,&#x2014;to have surveyed my feelings before opening your parcel, the other night, and after opening it: to have seen with what hysterical speed I undid the grey cover; how I turned over the poor tomes; how I shook them, and searched them through and through; and found&#x2014;Miss Welsh&#x2019;s &#x2018;compliments&#x2019; to Mr. Car<hi rend="italic">slile</hi>, a gentleman, in whom, it required no small sagacity to detect my own representation! Upon the whole, I suppose, you did well to treat me so. I had dreamed and hoped, indeed; but what right had <hi rend="italic">I</hi> to hope, or even to wish?</p>
<p>Those latter volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Allemagne</hi> will perplex you, I fear. The third in particular is very mysterious; now and then quite absurd. Do not mind it much.&#x2014; Noehden is not come, the London Smacks being all becalmed. I hope it will arrive in time; to let us begin Lessing and Schiller and the rest, against <date when="1821-10-00">October</date>, without impediment. I shall send it out instantly.</p>
<p>I had a hundred thousand things to tell you; but <hi rend="italic">now</hi> I may not mention one of them. Those <hi rend="italic">compliments</hi> have put the whole to flight almost entirely: there remains little more than, as it were, a melancholy echo of what has been.</p>

<salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
<p>You must not be angry at me for this new intrusion. It is not without great trepidation that I venture on such a step; but I have conceived the most magnificent project, and your concurrence is absolutely necessary for realising it. My project is no less than <hi rend="italic">to set out in person to inspect and accelerate your progress in the German tongue</hi>! Some sunny morning, about the <date when="1821-08-01">first of August</date>, you are to find me beside you, at breakfast, when you least expect it. &#x201C;And where is the <hi rend="italic">magnificence</hi> of this?&#x201D; you ask: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Magnificent</hi>!&#x201D;&#x2014;and then you whisper something about <foreign><hi rend="italic">parturiunt montes</hi></foreign>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Parturiunt montes nascetur ridiculus mus&#x201D;</hi> (Horace, <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi>, l. 139). A. Carlyle gives the following loose translation: &#x201C;The mountain labour'd with prodigious throes, / And, lo! a mouse ridiculous arose.&#x201D; See also <ref target="volume-01/lt-18191215-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1819-12-15">15 Dec. 1819</date></ref>.</note> and smile most contemptuously on me and my project. Not without reason, I admit: but after all, &#x2018;these little things are great to little men&#x2019;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Goldsmith&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Traveller,&#x201D; and Carlyle&#x2019;s translation in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels, Works</hi>, XXIV, 255.</note> and besides it is altogether impossible for you to understand with what feelings I look forward to this event. You cannot form any adequate idea of the pleasure I already experience in anticipating the lightness of heart, with which I shall brush away the dews&#x2014;advancing &#x2018;right against the <pb id="pg-01-369" n="01:369"/>Eastern gate&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milton, &#x201C;L'Allegro,&#x201D; l. 59. A reference to East Lothian, Jane&#x2019;s abode. It may be related to the symbolic use of the East later in Carlyle&#x2019;s treatment of Blumine in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.</note>&#x2014;upon so brave an errand. With the prospect of green fields and fresh air for months before me, with all the sorrowful traffickings, and all the dreary drivelling sciolists of Edinburgh behind,&#x2014; I shall see you for a few moments, and be happy in your company once again. But alas! Will you let me come? Will you be at home then? If you say No, if you <hi rend="italic">do not</hi> say Yes, it will dash the whole of this gay Spanish Castle to the ground. Can you <hi rend="italic">find in your heart</hi> to do so? Can you? Tell me soon: and observe that by way of preliminary, I debar all speeches about <hi rend="italic">trouble</hi> and the like: you know well enough it will be no <hi rend="italic">trouble</hi>, whatever it be. Say only &#x201C;I shall be at home&#x201D;: the news will make one poor mortal richer than any King&#x2014;for a while.</p>
<p>I designed to thank you a hundred times, for the letter you honoured me with: but I may wait till&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">we meet</hi>. In your eyes, I doubt not, that small note seems a very plain prosaic affair, not worthy of thanks above twice at farthest: in mine it appears quite differently. To me the very seal has beauty in it. I have pondered the device with musings of various kinds&#x2014; And would you not pardon me, if the wish arose among them for a moment that <hi rend="italic">All' Amist&#xE0;</hi> [both words underscored twice] <hi rend="italic">were</hi> in very deed the motto&#x2014;once and evermore between us! The thing itself looks so delicious, that even this faint fallacious shadow of it has a value. But I am wandering.&#x2014; To return&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">When</hi> will you write to me? To-morrow? Next day? If you knew <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, you would sit down <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi>, and say <foreign><hi rend="italic">La Reine le veut</hi></foreign>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;La Reine le veult,&#x201D; a Norman French phrase added by the Queen to bills of Parliament which are about to become law, thereby signifying her assent.</note> I do in fact most devoutly entreat you to write, the very first minute you can spare. If you do not, I shall get into a thousand quandaries, about having offended you and so forth,&#x2014;that any one would pity me, and forget my levities and <hi rend="italic">impolitesses</hi>, tho&#x2019; the source of them were deeper than it is. If you were merely &#x2018;a very accomplished young Lady,&#x2019; I would write to you differently&#x2014;if I wrote at all. <closer><salute>As it is, I somehow think you <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> me, and need not to be told with what <hi rend="italic">respect</hi> as well as affectionateness, I remain,</salute></closer></p>

<name>Thomas Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>Let me beg most humbly that you will not call me Car&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">slile</hi> any more. I am sure I would not so misname aught belonging to you, not <pb id="pg-01-370" n="01:370"/>even your lap-dog Shandy (<foreign><hi rend="italic">qui vivat valeatque</hi></foreign>!) [to whom long life!]&#x2014;for any consideration.</p>
<p>Has Irving sent his Grammar yet? That unhappy one of Noehden&#x2019;s, about which I have spoken till I am ashamed to mention it again, is not arrived.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had asked Irving to send a grammar as a substitute for Noehden, but Irving had written to Jane on <date when="1821-07-09">9 July</date>: &#x201C;I had last night a Letter from Carlyle, about a German Grammar, requesting me to send mine, as one he ordered for you has not come to hand. This I think exceeding preposterous, considering the distance, and that my Grammar is one of the nudest commonest sort. He encourages you to wade onward through the entanglements which grow along the edge that you may swim together down the Ethereal stream of German Poetry,&#x2014;against the Winter&#x201D; (A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 415). To Carlyle, Irving wrote on <date when="1821-07-24">24 July</date>: &#x201C;I did not follow your injunctions of transmitting to our fair acquaintance my German Grammar &#x26; Dictionary&#x2014;her own being as much to her purpose.&#x201D; Irving also made clear in his letters to Carlyle, written at this time, that he was afraid of the influence which German literature might have on Jane&#x2019;s morals and manners.</note> The foolish persons have disappointed me very much in the matter. It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> coming now, I believe: I trust it will be here before <date when="1821-08-00">August</date>. Will you not let me <hi rend="italic">bring</hi> it? <hi rend="italic">Yes, you will</hi>.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu!</foreign></salute></closer></p></ps>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I got your letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1821-07-15">15 July</date>.</note> about an hour ago as I was sitting down to tea; and read it with great avidity, finding it an excellent relish to that <pb id="pg-01-371" n="01:371"/>meal to hear so precise an account of persons who are always so dear to me, and of whom I have remained in considerable ignorance for several weeks. It is pity that the carrier disappointed you in regard to the letters you intended for me: but every human purpose, it has long been known, is liable to similar crosses; and in the present case there is less room for regret as I expect soon to have the felicity of ascending <hi rend="italic">Bitty&#x2019;s</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to John&#x2019;s landlady at Annan.</note> stairs in person, and eliciting from you at greater length by word of mouth the whole class of matters which your pen could hardly suffice even to give a sketch of. I do not precisely know what week I shall be down; but it cannot easily be beyond the third or so from this date.</p>
<p>As to my health, which you inquire so affectionately after, it cannot be said to be <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> yet; but it has considerably improved of late. Sea-bathing I follow pretty diligently, and would more diligently follow it, were not the frith at such a distance, the roads so dusty and the days so hot. Of walking I have enough: indeed I think I am apt to err in excess in that particular; the last three days I have walked very little, and yet have not felt so whole for some months. I am going to <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> continually when I get home; it is better than walking: and often as I have been baulked, I am not without hope of finding permanent benefit from the operation. At all events I must try: without some improvement in the constitution, I am as good as dead in the eye of law already; good for nothing but lolling about the room, reading poetry, imagining and fancying and fretting and fuming&#x2014;all to no purpose earthly. I have <hi rend="italic">studied</hi> none or written none for many days. Nevertheless I am moderately comfortable or even happy at present. My confidence in Fortune seems to increase as her offers to me diminish. I have very seldom been poorer than I am or more feeble or more solitary (if <hi rend="italic">kindred</hi> minds form society); and yet I have at no time felt less disposition to knuckle to low persons, or to abate in any way of the stubborn purposes I have formed, or to swerve from the track&#x2014;thorny and desolate as it is&#x2014;which I have chosen for journeying thro&#x2019; this world. I foresee much trouble before me, but there are joys too: and, joy or not joy, I must <supplied>[go]</supplied> forward now. When you launch a boat upon the falls of Niagara, it must go <hi rend="italic">down</hi> the roaring cataract, tho&#x2019; rocks and ruin lie within the profound abyss below: And just so if a man taste the magic cup of literature, he must drink of it forever, tho&#x2019; bitter ingredients enough be mixed with the liquor. A good firm heart&#x2014;and&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">observe this</hi>&#x2014;sound health, will keep one up under any <pb id="pg-01-372" n="01:372"/>thing: therefore, Jack, I am of good cheer myself, and I bid thee be of good cheer likewise. What is there to fear, indeed? With health and liberty and the love of truth, poverty, if it must accompany, may be endured: and when a man &#x2018;goeth to his long home&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccles. 12:5.</note>&#x2014;whither he will soon go, it is a proud thing to go with a free and generous spirit, with &#x2018;thoughts that wander thro&#x2019; eternity&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 148.</note> and a heart that does not fear to follow them&#x2014;or need not fear. What will the poor King<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George IV was not crowned until <date when="1821-07-25">25 July</date>; but the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> had mistakenly announced (in <date when="1821-06-00">June</date>) that it would be on <date when="1821-07-19">19 July</date>.</note> they were crowning yesterday and shouting and jollifying about over all the empire, inherit of his lordships shortly. A coffin with gold nails, and some square yard of space within the cells of Windsor. Will the tears of good men moisten his pall? Will the memory of his name kindle one generous emotion in the mind of any living creature? Who envys him? The poorest peasant may work out for himself a far nobler destiny, if he please: the poorest peasant need not envy him. Go on then, my bold Tongleg, let nothing daunt thee! By firm and prudent conduct, thou wilt acquire respect and competence every way here, I doubt not; and for the Hereafter, these qualities are&#x2014;useful also.</p>
<p>But I am preaching, when I should be recording or inquiring. I pray you therefore, by way of returning from my digression, most earnestly pray you Jack, to be careful of that inflammation<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;Being threatened with a new inflammation in the lungs, I had to blister myself.&#x201D;</note> which has so importunately visited you again. Do not work too hard, do not work at all, when you feel yourself uneasy at the task. Never mind progress; you are doing wonders in that respect already: be easy, I tell you, be easy. And do not too proudly look down upon the society you can find around you in Annan. Believe my sad experience, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is a sad error. I know well enough your comrades are &#x2018;a feeble folk&#x2019;; but still they are <hi rend="italic">a</hi> folk; and depend upon it, you will repent this gloomy seclusion of yourself from their accustomed haunts how barren and beaten soever&#x2014;if you persist in it.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;Secluded from company almost entirely, I pass my days in Annan in a silent and sedentary manner. &#x2026; I might enjoy the society of some personages here; but they are so absolutely earthy, so exclusively self-interested, and there is so little edification of any kind, or even momentary amusement, to be derived from such society, that I am fairly convinced that their friendship, if it deserve the name<supplied>[,]</supplied> is not worth the having.&#x201D;</note> There is no real happiness, Jack, out of the common routines of life. Happy he who can walk in <pb id="pg-01-373" n="01:373"/>them daily, and yet ever be casting his eye over the sublime scenery which solicits us from the far and elevated regions of philosophy! I have missed this rare combination, you observe, and I am paying for it. Do not you do likewise! Be social and frank and friendly with all honest persons: Practice will soon make it easy, and the reward is wholesome and abundant. Go out, I bid you, from the <hi rend="italic">camera obscura</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Bitty Geel</hi>; go out frequently, and talk&#x2014;talk even with the Jurist, Fergusson, Irving or any of them.</p>
<p>When I get home, I am going to exhibit all this more at larg<supplied>[e and]</supplied> in more luminous order&#x2014;appealing to myself, as I may well do: for proof experimental of a theory which I can so easily demonstrate <foreign><hi rend="italic">a priori</hi></foreign>. Muster all your counter arguments before my appearance. And <hi rend="italic">when</hi> will that be? So soon as I have got that beggarly article <hi rend="italic">the Netherlands</hi> (for which I can find next to no materials) off my hands, and I began working at it some days since. Irving &#x26; I spoke of travelling by the west somewhere: we have not arranged it yet. But this Netherlands is the main bar; I have no <hi rend="italic">pluck</hi> in me for such things at present&#x2014;yet it must be <hi rend="italic">clampered</hi> together in some shape, and shall if I keep wagging. Tell David Fergusson that I am charmed with his manuscript; it is the prettiest ever was written for the Encyclopedia, and perfectly correct. I shall give you enough to write in harvest&#x2014;at present I have nothing.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John because he was unwell had got David Fergusson to copy Carlyle&#x2019;s life of Pascal. John asked for more copying to do as practice. A fragment of the &#x201C;Pascal&#x201D; with a passage in French and Latin in John&#x2019;s hand is preserved in the NLS.</note></p>
<p>Tell Sandy how I am pressed for time, &#x26; how I cannot get written to him. I expect his <hi rend="italic">long</hi> and long-looked-for letter by Farries. My Mother and my Father you do not mention particularly: I trust however they are well. Of the Former indeed I dare but trust so comparatively, I have got more acquainted with her past &#x26; present state, last winter than ever. Be kind to her I conjure you all.</p>
<p>They need hardly send me any thing in the box&#x2014;I shall be off so soon. I want it merely to stow my luggage in. The fresh butter is done, the <hi rend="italic">salt</hi> I cannot eat now&#x2014;it is got musty. But there is good enough stuff to be had at hand, and I use little.&#x2014; About my health I advise you to be under no concern: I have undoubtedly told you the <hi rend="italic">very worst</hi>, perhaps something more. To look me in the face you would say nothing ailed me: and in fact what is it&#x2014;but a given quantity of pain and obstruction, without any the least immediate danger.&#x2014; My <pb id="pg-01-374" n="01:374"/>love to all at Mainhill, including Nancy<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nancy Grierson. One of Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s sisters had married a Grierson. She had died and he had re-married. Nancy could have been a true cousin or a child by the later marriage. She was obviously a great favorite with the Carlyle boys.</note> our cousin if she be with you still. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu!</foreign></salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have still a few minutes on hand before the time of delivering up my packet to the care of Garthwaite; I cannot easily employ them better than in writing a line or two for your perusal. A line or two, you see, is all that this paper will hold; and in fact I do not need much more. I am to see you very soon, when we shall meet over a savoury dish of tea <foreign><hi rend="italic">down-the-house</hi></foreign> [in the room at the back of the house]; and discuss in concert all that has happened to each of us since we parted. That will be a much finer method than the tardy plan of exchanging letters&#x2014;which however copious are always a very unfaithful and inadequate emblem of the truth.</p>
<p>I care not how soon I were down at Mainhill: for this city is fast getting very unpleasant. The smell of it, or rather the hundred thousand smells are altogether pestilential, at certain hours. And then the dust, and, more than all together, <hi rend="italic">the noise</hi>&#x2014;of many animals, and many carts, and fishwives innumerable; not to mention men selling water (of which there is a thirst &#x26; a scarcity here) armed with long battered tin-horns, that utter forth a voice&#x2014;to which the combined music of an ass a hog and fifty magpies all blended into one rich melody were but a fool. The man wakens me every morning about seven of the clock, with a full-flowing screech, that often makes me almost tremble.</p>
<p>I hope you are getting into better health now when the weather is bright and invigorating. Have you ever got down to sea-bathing, this summer? You should try it <hi rend="italic">by all means</hi>. It is quite a specific to me; if I lived by the shore, I am almost certain I should recover completely. <pb id="pg-01-375" n="01:375"/>This last winter and spring I have had more light thrown upon your various indispositions than I ever got before. I may say I never till lately knew how to pity you as I ought. These nerves when they get deranged are the most terrific thing imaginable. I do entreat you, my dear Mother, to take the most minute and scrupulous charge of your health&#x2014;for the sake of us all. No one can tell what you have endured already&#x2014; Take care! take care!</p>
<p>As to news or any thing of that sort, you will find all I have to say in the boys&#x2019; letters. At any rate <supplied>[you]</supplied> see, the paper is finished, and I must withdraw. Give my love to my Father &#x26; all the <hi rend="italic">wee things</hi>&#x2014;not forgetting Nancy if she is still with you.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir</salute>
<p>Goethe will not come to me! I have tried again and again, but cannot master the spirit of the original in my translation. Here are my first lines:&#x2014;</p>
<lg><l>The waters rush'd, the waters swelled</l>
<l>A fisher sat thereby,</l>
<l>Dull gazing on the line he held,</l>
<l>He felt no grief nor joy.</l></lg>
<p><pb id="pg-01-376" n="01:376"/>The last, I am aware, gives very inadequately the exquisite &#x201C;<foreign>Kuhl bis ans Herg [Herz] hinan</foreign>&#x201D;; but I can do no better. However I may send my last four lines as well, and give you the rest when I see you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This may indicate expectancy of further meetings in Edinburgh, which appear to have taken place. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210901-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1821-09-01">1 Sept.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210814-TC-EI-01">TC to EI, <date when="1821-08-14">14 Aug.</date></ref>: &#x201C;I saw the fair pupil in Edinburgh.&#x201D; But Carlyle&#x2019;s letter to Irving could refer to the <date when="1821-07-00">July</date> visit.</note></p>
<lg><l>She spoke to him, she sang to him,</l>
<l>His love of earth was o&#x2019;er;</l>
<l>With gentle force she drew him in,</l>
<l>He sank to rise no more.</l></lg>
<p>Now as I have kept my promise to give you my verse translations, and tame enough they are, in all conscience, to go by the carrier&#x2014; I trust you fu<supplied>[l]</supplied>fil yours to let me have all your own poetry. All!</p>

<p><salute>My dear Alick&#x2014;</salute> I have merely a few minutes to write you in; and my head is turning sadly during the operation&#x2014;for I have been dining and <foreign><hi rend="italic">gaffaaing</hi></foreign> [laughing] with one Nichol,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Walter Nichol, well-known Edinburgh teacher of mathematics. He taught at the High School there. See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 22.</note> a Mathematical Teacher here. But half a minute would suffice to say all my say; which is only to tell you that I design to come home forthwith, that is to say, on Monday next, the <date when="1821-08-13">13th of August</date>, in the year of Grace eighteen hundred and twenty-one. I shall mount the Dumfries mail-coach about eight of the clock on that important morning: and I expect to be in Moffat (no miracle occurring to stop me) about four in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Therefore, my dear Alick, you will proceed instantly, on receipt of this, and attach the quadruped Dumple to the rack, giving him what corn and hay he is able to consume; that so on Monday morning that famous charger may be strengthened to undertake the journey to Moffat, and transport my carcass down to Mainhill upon his back. &#x2026;</p>
<p>Within the last three weeks, I have written almost as much as I had ever written before in the whole course of my natural life. Not only my own two stipulated Articles, but <hi rend="italic">another</hi>, which the very <pb id="pg-01-377" n="01:377"/>shifty Editor called upon me not to write only but to <hi rend="italic">manufacture</hi>, the proper Author, one Erskine, a Laird, having fallen sick,&#x2014;or gone stupid (I should say <hi rend="italic">stupider</hi>), and not being able to finish what he had already begun and even got printed.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Could this be Thomas Erskine (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>), advocate, theologian, and laird of Linlathen (near Dundee)? If so, Carlyle&#x2019;s opinion of him was to change radically shortly after their first meeting in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>. For then he came to like him &#x201C;as one would do a draught of sweet rustic <hi rend="italic">mead</hi>, served in cut glass and <supplied>[on]</supplied> a silver tray&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, III, 127). Thenceforth a mutual respect and admiration developed between them, and they came to be the best of friends. Erskine&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Remarks on the Internal Evidence for the Truth of Revealed Religion</hi> was published in <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>.</note> It was <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a job. But I have done it all now; and spite of that wretched <hi rend="italic">bog</hi>, I am merry as a maltman. They are printing it even now; and <hi rend="italic">if</hi> you but saw my table; how it is covered with manuscripts and first copies and proofsheets and pens and snuffers and tumblers of water and pipes of tobacco! But no matter.</p>
<p>On Monday morning then, you will start about nine o&#x2019;clock and meet me pointedly. If <hi rend="italic">you</hi> cannot come, even Jamie<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their brother.</note> would do; but you would do better. Should circumstances prevent you, however, do not mind it: I shall wait till eleven, and then ascend the Glasgow mail&#x2014;appearing, in that case, at Mainhill before duck-rising. &#x2026;</p>
<p>I was going to bid you call for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> letter on Saturday; but I am a Scot and no Irishman to produce <hi rend="italic">bulls</hi>;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The ridiculous errors said to be made by the Irish. TC&#x2019;s remark above has &#x201C;Irish&#x201D; illogicality.</note> therefore I trust to Fate that you will get the news on Sunday at farthest.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Good-night, my dear Alick! I am amazingly sleepy&#x2014;but notwithstanding always, your affectionate Brother,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Irving:</salute>
<p>All hands being off to <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Lamb fair,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This day <date when="1821-08-13">13 Aug.</date>, Old Lammas Day. Several fairs were listed for this date in the region around Mainhill.</note> and I sole master of this house, so silent at this hour, I devote the morrow of my return home to discharging a debt which I have calculated on the pleasure of discharging any time these three weeks. Yesterday, from the period of my leaving Edin<hi rend="italic">h</hi> to that of my arrival here&#x2014;from six o&#x2019;clock in the <pb id="pg-01-378" n="01:378"/>morning to 11 at night&#x2014;was a series of fatigues and disappointments and discomforts; but a warm welcome awaited me at the end; and today I have been out breathing the free breeze of my own hills, I have looked at the fields, green as a new-dug emerald; I have seen all things, living and lifeless, happy; and I feel happy myself to bear them company. So I am going to write with great alacrity.</p>
<p>Perhaps for a moment I experienced some shade of regret when you told me of the necessary failure of our travelling project.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a letter to Carlyle of <date when="1821-07-24">24 July</date> Irving had said that he could not have the pleasure of traveling southward with Carlyle in the autumn.</note> The thousand pleasures I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have enjoyed rushed at once upon my mind, and the recollection that they were gone came along with the idea of them; but a very brief consideration showed me that my own fortune, not yours, was to be blamed in the affair. The truth is if you had not disappointed me, I must have disappointed you; the state of my health was such as to forbid the hope of enjoying anything or letting another enjoy anything in my company. You do not believe in any of these <hi rend="italic">imaginations</hi>. My earnest prayer is that you may never believe in them. I was once as sceptical as yourself on that head; till a stern experience convinced me far too well. Such disorders, I now, to my sorrow, feel convinced, are the heaviest calamity, the very heaviest, that the lot of life has in store for mortals. The bodily pain is nothing or next to nothing; but alas for the dignity of man! The evil does not stop here. No strength of soul can avail you; this malady will turn that very strength against yourself; it banishes all thought from your head, all love from your heart&#x2014;and doubles your wretchedness by making you discern it. O! the long, solitary, sleepless nights that I have passed&#x2014;with no employment but to count the pulses of my own sick heart&#x2014;till the gloom of external things seemed to extend itself to the very centre of the mind, till I could remember nothing, observe nothing! All this magnificent nature appeared as if blotted out, and a grey, dirty, dismal vapour filled the immensity of space; I stood alone in the universe&#x2014;alone, and as it were a circle of burning iron enveloped the soul&#x2014;excluding from it every feeling but a stonyhearted, dead obduracy, more befitting a demon in its place of woe than a man in the land of the living! I tell you, my friend, nothing makes me shudder to the inmost core&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> but this.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See the wasteland imagery in &#x201C;The Everlasting No&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>. It is worth noting that in Carlyle the relation between physical health and spiritual health is always a very close one.</note> One&#x2019;s spirit may be bruised and broken by moral afflictions; but at least it will <pb id="pg-01-379" n="01:379"/>break like the spirit of a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>; moral affections will irradiate its painful strugglings, and the last gleam of being will be pure if it is feeble. But here&#x2014;I declare I will not speak another word on the subject. I can hardly excuse myself for saying so much&#x2014;except by trying to suppose that it was intended partly for other purposes than those of a common valetudinarian. It is too true that I have been a very ill-conditioned person for a long while; and you, who least of all deserved it, have not escaped without a share of my ill-humour. You must convince yourself, if possible, that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> this proceeded from physical causes: call me an <hi rend="italic">atrabiliar</hi>, but not an ingrate. I shall get well here; and then I am persuaded you will reckon me a very decent character. In fact, it is high time I were well&#x2014;above all if the effect which I have predicted is indeed the consequence of <hi rend="italic">wellness</hi>. I have had no leisure for many days to think of anything, the pain has so distracted me; and my faculties have all taken into the wildest courses, the whole inward man has become extravagant, unearthly. I require imperiously to be overhauled and severely castigated every way. If I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> so employ my rustication! I shall long for you often, tho&#x2019; you never censure me&#x2014; I hardly know another that has any right to do it. &#x201C;Immaculate man!&#x201D; you exclaim: not so, sir; but every crime has its proper court. The Quorum, for instance, cannot go beyond five pounds sterling.</p>
<p>I was dreadfully busy for the last five weeks of my stay in Edin<hi rend="italic">h</hi> writing day and night, when sleeplessness and so forth had rendered me a fitter inmate for a Bedlam than a study. I was labouring at an account, the weakest in nature, of the <hi rend="italic">Netherlands, Newfoundland</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Articles for Brewster&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</hi>.</note> etc.&#x2014;when a new call was made upon me. And from whom? No other than our unforgotten Francis Dickson, crying bitterly for <hi rend="italic">one</hi> line from Europe.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dickson had written from the Bermudas on <date when="1821-06-20">20 June</date>: &#x201C;May I ask you to mingle mercy with judgement and write me upon the receipt of this&#x2014; I have not had a line from Europe since I left it. &#x2026; The watchword is <hi rend="italic">soon</hi><supplied>[.]</supplied> I hope the time will be kept.&#x201D; He had no good word to say for the inhabitants or climate of the place: &#x201C;They have the habits, ideas, and manners of fishermen. It is well known to all the world, what these are<supplied>[.]</supplied> A man had better have any other in their stead. In addition I may remark, this islet &#x2026; has had considerable intercourse with various parts of the civilized world, in consequence of which the inhabitants have assumed, if I may be allowed the expression a dash of civilization, but in the long run the fisherman is still foremost. They are no more humanized beings &#x2026; than a Parrot is a man, though it speaks.&#x201D; There is a great deal more in a similar vein.</note> I have not given it him yet; but I will soon. He had kind remembrances to you, of course.</p>
<p>Frank is evidently not happy in his place. He is not healthy; has <pb id="pg-01-380" n="01:380"/>too much work to manage; and the people, he says, are in the <hi rend="italic">fishing</hi> state&#x2014;not the <hi rend="italic">hunting</hi> as other savages&#x2014;because they have nothing to hunt. He mocks, however, and sneers and swaggers as usual. I feel for poor Frank: he is a kind of bastard genius, and I honour even a natural child of that family. I shall write to him very soon.</p>
<p>Quite a different individual&#x2014;a friend of ours&#x2014;was asking for me here lately&#x2014;William Grahame, of Burnswark. I fear he has left the province; yet I have scouts on the outlook for him all over Lockerby to-day, and still entertain some hope of seeing him. Bid him write, if I fail. &#x201C;He is the freest, best talker&#x201D; they say here &#x201C;excepting&#x201D;&#x2014;I shall not mention the exception <hi rend="italic">now</hi>.</p>
<p>Noehden&#x2019;s Grammar is gone to Haddington. I saw the fair pupil in Edinburgh. She is certainly the most&#x2014;fit to read German of any creature I have met with. Take no fear of those people, I tell you.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving had written to Carlyle: &#x201C;I am not competent to judge of their [German writers&#x2019;] value towards the developement of thought or character<supplied>[;]</supplied> you are and therefore I should be silent&#x2014; But if they should tend to cut our young friend off from any of the wholesome intercourse of those amongst whom she is cast, without being able to raise her to a better I should be very sorry.&#x201D; He goes on to say rather scathingly that Jane Welsh is already too much inclined to cut herself off from those around her and to be contemptuous of them rather than sympathetic and understanding.</note> They are good men&#x2014;some are even excellent. Schiller, for example, you most certainly would like. He has all the innocence and purity of a child, with the high talents and strong volitions of a man: a rare union, of which I never but in one instance saw anything like a <hi rend="italic">living</hi> example. The trash of Germany, their Kotzebues<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Auguste Kotzebue (<date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>&#x2013;<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>), German author of highly sentimental plays.</note> and his spawn, I know little of, very little, and yet enough. We shall eschew them altogether. My paper is done&#x2014;and I have not spoken the five-hundredth part of my mind. Write to me whenever you want to get a second fraction; it will be a double pleasure to me here. <closer><salute>My best regards to your mother and sister.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
<p>On again noticing this crabbed hand of mine, I fear, you are ready to exclaim with some feelings of surprise and displeasure: Why troublest thou me? To this very natural question it were tedious and difficult to make any satisfactory reply. The causes which give motion to my pen at present are too vague and complicated for being discussed in the preface to a single letter; and hardly of importance enough to a second person for being discussed anywhere. Perhaps it is more expedient, as it is certainly easier, to throw myself on your good-nature at once; to supplicate your indulgence if I prove tiresome, your forgiveness if I be so unfortunate as to offend. You know well enough it is far from my intention to do either: and cases are every day arising in which a generous person finds it just to let the innocence of the purpose serve as an excuse for the faultiness of the deed. Upon this principle, if on no other, I entreat you, <hi rend="italic">be not</hi> angry with me! If you saw into my views properly, I am sure you would not.</p>
<p>The truth is, in this remote district, where so few sensible objects occur to arrest my attention&#x2014;while I am too sick and indolent to search for intellectual objects&#x2014;the Imagination is the busiest faculty, and shadows of the past and the future, are nearly all I have to occupy myself with. But in the multitude of anticipations and remembrances, it is quite conceivable that your image should be occasionally present with me: and all men love to talk or at least to write on subjects about which they often think. Nor is it merely as an absent friend that I contemplate you, and have a kind of claim to converse with you. It is impossible for me, without many <hi rend="italic">peculiar</hi> emotions, to behold a being like you entering so devotedly upon the path of Letters, which I myself have found to be as full of danger as it is of beauty: and tho&#x2019; my own progress in it bears but indifferent testimony to my qualifications as a Guide, I may be allowed to offer you the result of my experience, such as it is, and to pronounce the &#x2018;Good-speed!&#x2019; which I wish you in silence so frequently &#x26; so cordially.</p>
<p>I am not now going to depreciate your studies, or tease you with advices to abandon them. I said enough on that side of the question when we were together last; and stupidly&#x2014;as native dulness, aggravated <pb id="pg-01-382" n="01:382"/>by a sleepless week, and the fat contented presence of Mr Baird,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably James Baird, another of Jane&#x2019;s admirers, referred to in her letters to Eliza Stodart.</note> could make me say it: and after all I believe my habitual opinion is not of that sort. To me those pursuits have been the source of much disquiet; but also of some enviable enjoyment: if they have added a darker shade to the gloom of my obscure destiny, I ought not to forget that here and there they have chequered it with a ray of heavenly brightness, which seemed to make amends for all. The case is similar with every one that follows literature: it increases our sensibility to pleasure as well as pain; it enlarges the circle of objects capable of affecting us; and thus at once deepens and diversifies the happiness and the misery of our life. The latter in a higher ratio, I fear: yet here it is often blamed unjustly; there are perturbed souls to whose unrest it gives direction rather than existence: and tho&#x2019; the charge were altogether just, what could be made of it? Happiness is not our final aim in this world&#x2014;or poor Shandy<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Welsh&#x2019;s dog.</note> would be the finest character in the nation. It is the complete development of our faculties&#x2014;the increase in capacity as sentient and thinking creatures that constitutes the first want: and as mental excellence&#x2014;to think well and feel nobly&#x2014;is doubtless the highest of all attainments&#x2014;so the mental nourishment which literature affords, as richly as any object of human activity, should stand among the foremost of our desires. Nourishment of any kind may, indeed, by injudicious application, be converted into poison; and mental nourishment forms no exception to the rule. But if its <hi rend="italic">abuse</hi> may lead to isolation from our brethren, and to every species of wretchedness; its prudent <hi rend="italic">use</hi> does not of necessity exclude from any other source of happines<supplied>[s.]</supplied> Often, it is true, the studious man wanders in solitude over rocky &#x26; tempestuous regions: but sometimes a lovely scene will strike his eye as well as that of another, and touch him more keenly than it does another:&#x2014;some sweet sequestered dale,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly an echo of the &#x201C;cool sequestered vale of life&#x201D; of Gray&#x2019;s &#x201C;Elegy.&#x201D;</note> embosomed calmly among the barren mountains of life,&#x2014;so verdant and smiling and balmy&#x2014;so like a home and resting place for the wearied spirit, that even the sight of it is happiness: to <hi rend="italic">reach</hi> it would be too much; would bring Eden back again into the world, and make Death to be indeed, what cowards have named him, the enemy of man.&#x2014;O! that it lay with me to shew you the means of scriving all the benefits to be found in such pursuits, without any of the harm! But it may not be. The law of our existence is that good and evil <pb id="pg-01-383" n="01:383"/>are inseparable always: the heart that can taste of rapture must taste of torment also, and find the elements of both in all things it engages with. Nevertheless I counsel you to persevere. In your advantages natural and accidental, there exist the materials of a glorious life; and if in cultivating the gifts of your mind, you can but observe the <hi rend="italic">Golden mean</hi>, which it is so easy to talk of, so difficult to find&#x2014;if in striving after what is great and productive of honour, you do not <hi rend="italic">too</hi> widely deviate from what is common and productive of comfort&#x2014;the result will not still be unmixed, but I shall join with thousands in rejoicing at it. The hazard is great, the alternative appalling: but I augur <hi rend="italic">well</hi>.</p>
<p>My sheet is done while my subject is scarce begun. Shall I not have another opportunity to enter on it? I still entertain a <hi rend="italic">firm trust</hi> that you are to read Schiller and Goethe with me in <date when="1821-10-00">October</date>. I never yet met with any to relish their beauties; and sympathy is the very soul of life.&#x2014; <closer><salute>This letter is amazingly stupid. It is enough if it recal<supplied>[l]</supplied> to your memory, without displeasure, one who desires your welfare in every sense as honestly as he can desire any thing,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Murray,</salute>
<p>Mr Johnstone (your old Friend <hi rend="italic">Clint&#x2019;s</hi> nephew) having it in view to set out for Edinburgh tomorrow, and offering very frankly to take charge of any letters from me, I have seized the pen with purpose to scribble you a few lines&#x2014;on the old subject&#x2014;nothing; and thereby at once to comply with your desire, and gratify my own garrulous propensities, which still exist in their pristine vigour, tho&#x2019; in this quarter they have but indifferent scope for exercise. Philosophers maintain that life should be filled up with action and speculation blended in due proportions: I have been forking sheaves all day&#x2014;which in all conscience is action enough, and as this letter will doubtless contain much speculation of as valuable and heroic a cast, I flatter myself you will say of me, that, for one twenty-four hours at least, <foreign><hi rend="italic">omne tuli punctum</hi></foreign>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci</hi></foreign>&#x201D;: &#x201C;He has gained every point who has blended the useful with the agreeable&#x201D; (Horace, <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi>, l. 343).</note></p>
<p>You recollect what a fidget I was in to get home, when we parted; I anticipate your surprise when you learn that since my return I have been totally idle. I came home from Galloway, with no fruit of my expedition, but mingled recollections of pleasures sullied and friends vexed by my disquietude; and to look at my proceedings subsequently, you would think I was a second Columbus that had brought back&#x2014;not a morsel of Broughton&#x2019;s copper&#x2014;but news of a fresh Continent, and had nothing henceforth to do but rest under the shadow of his laurels. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Cela ne se tiendra pas</hi></foreign> [That won&#x2019;t hold water]: it will not. I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> compile that trash for their Cyclopedia, tho&#x2019; it were ten times stupider and I ten times sicker; I must have it off my hands; and then bestir myself, <foreign><hi rend="italic">ardua ardens</hi></foreign> [eager for difficulties], for something greater;&#x2014;if I would not die the most disagreeable of all deaths, the death <pb id="pg-01-385" n="01:385"/>of <hi rend="italic">Jenkin&#x2019;s Hen</hi>, who perished as historians say, not from want of food or shelter or any earthly convenience, but merely because she was tired of living&#x2014;her heart was sated, and smitten with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">tedium vitae</hi></foreign> [weariness of life]. I pity the poor fowl, and must study to avoid her fate. But of this hereafter.</p>
<p>How do the Gallovidian sages prosper under your hands?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to the book on which Murray was working.</note> I hope the book is at last getting into types, any way. I saw Mr Duncan&#x2014;tho&#x2019; not on the day I expected: but I had no opportunity of mentioning your affair with M'Diarmid. At any rate, I understand Mr D. has no concern now with the printing establishment; so the Scrapman<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M'Diarmid, editor of the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, first published his <hi rend="italic">Scrapbook</hi> in <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>. A second series speedily followed, and both have been frequently reprinted.</note> is all you have to care for&#x2014;and for him a very little care will serve. Some printer&#x2019;s Devil or creature of that species, I believe, is going to publish poems at the Courier office: and the paper intended for you may thus come in stead another way.&#x2014; I hear not a word of Stewart Lewis<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18150201-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1815-02-01">1 Feb. 1815</date></ref>.</note> or his correspondence. If you seriously meditated writing some memorial of the poor castaway in any of your publications, I believe much of his correspondence might still be gleaned in this quarter: but except for a definite object of that kind, one cannot well be inquiring after it. Lewis I think is quite as worthy a subject as Dermody or Boyce:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Dermody (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>) was an Irish poet who died of dissipated habits. His complete works, <hi rend="italic">The Harp of Erin</hi>, were published in <date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>. Boyce may be William Boyce (<date when="1710-00-00">1710</date>&#x2013;<date when="1779-00-00">79</date>), musician, whose works were in the main published after his death.</note> if I were unemployed and had a turn that way I might&#x2014; But what does it profit?</p>
<p>A few days ago I received a parcel from your exalted Bibliopolist. He gave me a proof-sheet of that wretched article,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Joanna Baillie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Metrical Legends of Exalted Characters,&#x201D; New Edinburgh Review</hi> (<date when="1821-10-00">Oct. 1821</date>).</note> accompanied with a very civil note, and a copy of somebody&#x2019;s translation of Faustus by Goethe&#x2014;&#x201C;for criticism.&#x201D; Will you call on Waugh,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John (&#x201C;Bailie&#x201D;) Waugh, the bookseller of Waugh &#x26; Innes, formerly Oliphant, Waugh &#x26; Innes, a &#x201C;heavy pompous man of words&#x201D; according to Irving (NLS, 1764.202). Waugh &#x26; Innes published Murray&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Literary History of Galloway</hi>.

<salute>My dear Mitchell,</salute>
<p>I was down at Ruthwell the other week, and got the two books which you so punctually left for me; but as the promise recorded on the slip of paper stuck into Kiel<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably John Keill (<date when="1671-00-00">1671</date>&#x2013;<date when="1721-00-00">1721</date>), <hi rend="italic">Introductio ad Veram Physicam</hi> (<date when="1702-00-00">1702</date>); but possibly <hi rend="italic">Euclid</hi>, revised by Samuel Cunn, to which is added a treatise of the nature of arithmetic of logarithms &#x2026; and &#x2026; trigonometry &#x2026; by John Keill, 12th ed. (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>); or James Keill (<date when="1637-00-00">1637</date>&#x2013;<date when="1719-00-00">1719</date>), who applied Newtonian and mechanical principles to the explanation of bodily functions.</note> seems likely to be rather tardy in its fulfilment, I am going to interrupt your repose for a reason unconnected with borrowing or lending. I owe you an apology for my unceremonious desertion of our appointment: but I suppose you have already excused me: Murray will have told you the cause of my failure; how I went into Galloway, and rode and ran in all directions there without measure. How could I withstand such an opportunity of gadding? You cannot but forgive me.</p>
<p>In our perambulations thro&#x2019; &#x201C;that Attica of Scotland&#x201D; the Historian<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Murray. &#x201C;That Attica of Scotland&#x201D; may be a phrase from Murray&#x2019;s book; certainly the reference is to Galloway.</note> and I did not fail to visit the intended scene of your didactic labours, and to muse a little on the fruits which the Tree of Knowledge, pruned and watered by your steady hand, is likely to produce to yourself and the youth of Kirkcudbright. Our augury was favourable: and I rejoiced individually in the thought that my oldest, nearly my only, College friend had found so fair an arena for exhibiting his talents in the way most agreeable to himself, and acquiring some portion of those <pb id="pg-01-387" n="01:387"/>rewards which honest industry has the best of all rights to claim. Of the Gallovidian Capital I know nothing in particular: but I can easily predict that in commencing your functions and even in proceeding with them regularly, you will have much to strive with, which your previous experience has made you but imperfectly aware of. Human nature is nearly the same everywhere: and the tie by which a Schoolmaster is connected with his employers is at all times of so galling a kind, that there is no wonder both parties should wince under it occasionally. Busy bodies will be forward to offer you advices, remonstrances, complaints; the completion of your ideal schemes will be marred in part (it is but the continual destiny of Man!) by the ungainliness of your materials; and at first, it is likely, you may languish under the want of congenial society, and <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a home as you enjoyed at Ruthwell. My own experience of those things is trifling and unfavourable; yet I do not reckon the problem of succeeding in a school, and learning to remedy or endure all its grievances, one of extreme difficulty. First as in every undertaking, it is necessary, of course, that you <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to succeed: that you determine firmly to let nothing break your equanimity, that you &#x201C;lay aside <hi rend="italic">every</hi> weight&#x201D;&#x2014;your philosophical projects, your shyness of manner (if you are cursed with that quality) your jealous sense of independence&#x2014;every thing in short that circumstances may point out as detrimental to your interest with the people; and then, being thus balanced and set in motion, your sole after duty is to &#x201C;run with patience&#x201D;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heb. 12:1. The quotation begins above with &#x201C;Lay aside <hi rend="italic">every</hi> weight.&#x201D;</note> you will reach the goal undoubtedly. Public favour in some sense is requisite for all men; but a Teacher ought constantly to bear in mind, that it is life and breath to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>: hence in comparison with it nothing should be dear to him; he must be meek and kindly and soft of speech to every one, how absurd and offensive soever. To the same ob<supplied>[ject he]</supplied> must also frequently sacrifice the real progress of his pupils, if it cannot be gained without affecting their peace of mind. The advantages of great learning are so vague and distant, the miseries of constant whining are so immediate and manifest, that not one parent in a thousand can take the former in exchange for the latter&#x2014;with patience&#x2014;not to speak of thankfulness. For the same reason he must (if the fashion of the place require it) go about and visit his employers; he must <foreign>cook</foreign> [coax] them and court them by every innocent mode which the evervarying posture of circumstances will suggest to a mind on the outlook for them. This seems poor philosophy&#x2014;but it is true. The most diligent fidelity in discharging <pb id="pg-01-388" n="01:388"/>your duties will not serve you&#x2014;by itself. Never forget this&#x2014;it is mathematically certain. If men were angels, or even purely intellectual beings having judgement but no vanity or other passion, it might be different; but as it is, the case becomes much more complicated&#x2014;few very few had not rather be cheated than despised, and even in the common walks of life, probity is often left to rot without so much as being praised. It has the <hi rend="italic">alget</hi> without the <hi rend="italic">laudatur</hi>;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Probitas laudatur et alget&#x201D;</hi>: &#x201C;Honesty is praised and neglected&#x201D; (Juvenal, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>, I, 74).</note>&#x2014;which is a most sorry business doubtless.</p>
<p>I have written down all this, My dear Mitchell, not because I thought you <hi rend="italic">wanted</hi> it; on the contrary I imagine your talents and manners and temper promise you a distinguished success: but because I thought the fruit of my painful experience, might be worth <hi rend="italic">something</hi> to you, and that something however small I was anxious to offer you. Take it, and call it the <hi rend="italic">widow&#x2019;s mite</hi>, if you like. <closer><salute>It is from,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Fergusson,</salute>
<p>I have only two or three minutes which I can devote to you at present, being on the wing for Annan: but I cannot altogether let slip the opportunity, afforded me by Mr Johnstone&#x2019;s journey, of inquiring after your fortune, and assuring you that I take the same interest in it as I have always taken. I could not possibly see you the day before my departure; a thousand things occurred to prevent me: but I left a message for you with Galloway,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Galloway. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220222-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1822-02-22">22 Feb. 1822</date></ref>; Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, I, 115&#x2013;16.</note> which I hoped might have proved the means of eliciting a letter from you to enliven my rustication,&#x2014;especially as I understood that the Kirk<supplied>[c]</supplied>aldy affair was to be settled very speedily. I am not much surprised, however, that I have been disappointed. You have had <hi rend="italic">other tow to tease</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Other fish to fry.&#x201D; To have <hi rend="italic">tow</hi> on the distaff is to have work to do.</note> I suppose, than <pb id="pg-01-389" n="01:389"/>scribbling to me. Like Virgil&#x2019;s Romans you have been <hi rend="italic">acting</hi> not recording actions. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Excudent alii</hi></foreign>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Excudent alii spirantia mollius aera</hi></foreign>&#x201D;: &#x201C;Others shall beat out the breathing bronze with softer lines&#x201D; (Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, VI, 847).</note>&#x2014; What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> this other place which you have been provided with?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fergusson became rector of the High School at Arbroath in <date when="1821-09-00">Sept. 1821</date>.</note> I heard of it not an hour ago, and very vaguely. I trust it is something infinitely preferable to &#x201C;teaching the Latin in its purity&#x201D; at Kirkcaldy, which task I understand you have done wisely to decline. I wish you would tell me about it very soon: and that whether you tell me or not, it may turn out to be a field in which you can contentedly labour, and enjoy the just fruit of your labour. What more can a man desire?</p>
<p>For myself, I have been <hi rend="italic">breathing</hi> constantly since my return&#x2014;as you may conjecture, but doing little else. Dyspepsia is certainly the queen of human ills&#x2014; No more of her.&#x2014; I was in Galloway for a week or so seeking the picturesque. I found it sometimes; but what did it avail? Since my return, I have ridden and run, and slept and waked, and weltered along the stream of Time as best I might. There are two or three hundred things lying for me to write and manage: I had rather face the Enemy than touch one of them<supplied>[.]</supplied> So when I shall come to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, or how, or what I shall do there or enjoy or suffer&#x2014;is to be found only in the Sybilline Book or some such record&#x2014;to me it is unknown and unimportant.&#x2014; I got Goethe&#x2019;s head&#x2014;I mean his portrait&#x2014;the other night, and looked at it for many hours. I have an immense love for the man, you know: if skilled in metrical composit<supplied>[ion I]</supplied> would have indited some sonnet on <supplied>[the oc]</supplied>casion&#x2014;but having no turn that way <supplied>[the]</supplied> sonnet must lie drowned in the abysses of the brain&#x2014;with many as worthless things.

<p>I pray that you may not have left Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> till the end of this month&#x2014;in which case I <supplied>[sha]</supplied>ll most probably meet you. Write to me if <supplied>[possible]</supplied>. <closer><salute>I am always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Here am I arrived in safety once more, and down at the old trade of scribbling my adventures and feelings on paper to occupy my ever trusty friends with and gratify my own garrulity at the same time. There is nothing like room at present (for Garthwaite<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Garthwaite, a carrier.</note> leaves us in an hour) to tell you all my &#x201C;travel&#x2019;s history&#x201D;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, I, iii.</note> I must content myself with a sketch.</p>
<p>After parting with you on Wednesday evening,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >That is, <date when="1821-11-07">7 Nov.</date></note> James<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Johnston.</note> and I soon proceeded to bed in a neighbouring house connected with our inn. I say to <hi rend="italic">bed</hi>, for to sleep was not so speedy a matter. The hundred thousand thoughts that occupied me, could not perhaps have driven away the dewy God:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Morpheus. An allusion, perhaps, to the &#x201C;dewy-feathered sleep&#x201D; in &#x201C;Il Penseroso&#x201D; (l. 146) or to the &#x201C;dewy sleep&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> (IX, 1044).</note> but a more vulgar cause, the old one, aggravated too by my comarade&#x2019;s sonorous breathing, proved more effectual. James did not <hi rend="italic">light potatoe-shaws</hi> on that occasion; the sound of his nostrils was more like the far-off noise of two men (Ha' and Wullie Robison for instance) sawing knotty timber&#x2014;a small faint jingling music, with here and there a harsher, louder, quicker note&#x2014;when some one of the many snuff-valves which line our friend&#x2019;s promontory were unluckily closed. This held me doing for a time; but at length I got asleep, and might have made a reasonable job of it, had not the waiter come to rouse us at five o&#x2019;clock, with intelligence that the Coach was getting ready, and we must rise or get the worst places in it. We arose accordingly, and after many delays got fairly seated and under way; I on the roof behind the driver; James inside with a comfortable allotment of <hi rend="italic">five</hi> companions. He told me every stage, that, he was <hi rend="italic">stewed, braked, boiled</hi>, and so forth&#x2014;by which he meant only that he was greatly squeezed, and kept in hot, foul air. For myself I got on well. The dreadnought defended me from all cold in the beautiful morning; the fine scenery of Nithsdale revealed itself as the sun rose; and I had plenty of occupation in surveying it and asking after it. There was company too in abundance. A drunken Cattle-dealer attracted my first notice. He had been in the Police-office all night; and <pb id="pg-01-391" n="01:391"/>when they shouldered him up, no place seemed to him so convenient, as the place right behind my back, where he could both be screened from cold, and enjoy my shoulder as a pillow. I told him twice, that absolutely no price he could offer would induce me to let him lie there one minute, and so he must needs remove. The second telling was more emphatic than the first: it sent him to the hinder end; and I heard no more of him, except the loudest words of his blubbering mystification, and a few passionate petitions addressed to all and sundry, for a morsel of tobacco. He went away altogether at Thornhill. Two sprightlier personages were a young Glasgow literary &#x26; commercial adventurer named Clelland, with his acquaintance and mine the far-famed 'Squire Esbie,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Squire Esbie is described by Carlyle as &#x201C;a double-refined travelling tutor&#x201D; and dandy, &#x201C;a beauteous vision,&#x201D; though with no better prospects than &#x201C;some devil of a curacy,&#x201D; as he candidly said himself. Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, I, 159.</note> both of whom got planted near me; and we talked small talk together copiously whenever we felt so inclined. Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fifth baronet of Closeburn (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>).</note> and five small characters sat behind and talked or yawned as seemed convenient. In this wise we pushed along at an easy rate thro&#x2019; the wild moors of Durisdeer and Crawfurd, to the fair of Biggar&#x2014;where we dined on ginger-bread, and finally to Edinburgh, in which city we arrived two hours after the appointed time, namely, about eight o&#x2019;clock. I had felt no cold but on the contrary great enjoyment till near the end. Mrs Robertson was ready with open arms to receive James and me; and both of us still continue with her. I secured about seven hours&#x2019; sleep&#x2014;till my old friend the waterseller&#x2019;s tin-horn aroused me; and tho&#x2019; somewhat stiff and <hi rend="italic">confused</hi>, I feel in no bad order. Another night of sound repose will put me where I was.</p>
<p>There appears to have been nothing spoiling during my absence&#x2014;except partially that the printer has been rather anxious about the stuff I was writing. The teaching they spoke of was an absurd busine<supplied>[ss]</supplied> I could not have undertaken, and would not tho&#x2019; I could have it. I have not seen into lodgings yet or indeed done any thing except got up my box for the purpose of acco<supplied>[m]</supplied>modating the printers with their material. I design to continue here for a day or two&#x2014;at least till tomorrow&#x2014;that I may have time to look out for a suitable place to deposit myself in. Johnstone does not depart till Saturday at three o&#x2019;clock; but we have two beds, and he serves to keep me in talk. You may direct the box to Mrs R&#x2019;s 16. Carnegie-street, as usual: I will leave my address with her, at any rate. I wish it fitted me to stay with her altogether; but I must have quietness and fresh air, if possible.&#x2014; <pb id="pg-01-392" n="01:392"/>Brewster and Waugh (the Bookseller) and all the rest, I intend to see in due course&#x2014;that is to say, when I am settled.&#x2014; Thus, my dear Alick, have I expounded all my goings to you,&#x2014;at greater length than I purposed, for I love to talk to you on those points, and to see, with the mind&#x2019;s eye,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, I, ii.</note> all the expectant group of anxious faces gathered round my poor sheet while you recite it for the general good. My blessing be upon them all! It is the lot of life to meet and then to part; but I trust there are many joyful meetings in store for us yet, and a bright meeting <hi rend="italic">yonder</hi>, where the word <hi rend="italic">To part</hi> has no place in speech.&#x2014; I have only now to ask if you delivered all my trinkets to the <hi rend="italic">wee things</hi>, the bonnet to Mary, the umbrella to Mag, and his own to each generally. If not, see to rectify it forthwith. You will write of course, long and largely, next week: I shall then be able to tell you more. <closer><salute>I need scarcely add how sincerely</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
 <p>Little<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Little&#x201D; is &#x201C;Parliament Geordie,&#x201D; Dr. George Little. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18211117-TC-JCE-01">next letter</ref>.</note> appointed six o&#x2019;clock as the hour of taking in my letters, which is just at hand: so that I have but a very few minutes to be with you; and the first of these, I must devote to beg that you will accept the <hi rend="italic">brown</hi> pair of spectacles which I have <foreign><hi rend="italic">waled</hi></foreign> [chosen] for you, and wear them for my sake. They are not nearly so good as my father&#x2019;s, tho&#x2019; of the best Ladies&#x2019;-kind: but I will <hi rend="italic">come again</hi> some other time. If they help you to read your book at nights, and thereby yield you any pleasure, think that it is all returned to me fourfold. They can at once be changed if they do not fit.</p>
<p>I felt rather low in the humour several days after I went away. The fineness of the weather did not prevent the journey from <foreign><hi rend="italic">trashing</hi></foreign> [wearying] me a good deal: I felt nervously and spiritless; when I <pb id="pg-01-393" n="01:393"/>went to sleep, the picture of Mainhill and all my beloved friends there would flash across my brain so vividly and so &#x201C;sicklied o&#x2019;er with the pale cast of thought&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, i.</note>&#x2014;that I often started from my incipient slumber, and recollected with some painful feelings that I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> changed my home and kindred
for the habitation of a stranger. But this soon went away: and by dint of the ordinary remedies, I am now as well as when I left you. Not that I am altogether settled yet; tho&#x2019; altogether in my usual health. I have done no work&#x2014;except reading a little: and till work fairly begins you know well, there is no settlement. The reasons of my wavering are various. On Saturday after Johnstone departed, I set about the weary duty of seeking lodgings all round the environs of this city&#x2014;that if possible I might secure a place provided with the requisite comforts, and situated beyond the region of smoke and tumult. After wandering little less than the Shoemaker of Jerusalem<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Wandering Jew. See C. F. Harrold, ed., <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>, pp. 17&#x2013;18 n.</note> did, I at length pitched upon this situation, which is a neat little room and bed-room, at the very north-west corner of the New Town, above a mile from the centre of the Old. It is kept by a trim, little, <hi rend="italic">burring</hi> Northumbrian, and commands a view of the Firth and the Fifeshire mountains. Being a back-room, also, I thought it would needs be quiet as possible. But it is scarcely so; there are about fifty masons chopping away at a new Circus<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Royal Circus, completed in <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>.</note> on my right hand and on my left, by day; and when their rattling has ceased, various other noises take up their nightly tale. Now the question is, Whether shall I stand all this, and get inured to it as I certainly might, or try my luck elsewhere? Provost Swan, who wishes me greatly to be in the neighbourhood of his boy, called here the other night, and advised that I should move to Union-street or thereabouts (the North-east angle of the city), where Mrs David Swan<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Widow of Provost Swan&#x2019;s brother. See <hi rend="italic">Patrick Don Swan Provost of Kirkcaldy</hi> [anon] (Kirkcaldy, <date when="1895-00-00">1895</date>).</note>&#x2014;a friend of his, with whom the boy is settled,&#x2014;would find me out lodgings by her own experience among her neighbours. This good lady undertook the task; I am to see her this evening, when the matter will be decided; and I shall shift&#x2014;if I shift at all&#x2014;to-morrow. Till to-morrow, then, I postpone the commencement of business. But <hi rend="italic">then</hi>&#x2014;!</p>
<p>I have troubled you, My dear Mother, with all this detail, both because I know you wish to hear of all these matters in my history; and because this circumstance will render it advisable <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to send the <pb id="pg-01-394" n="01:394"/>little box along with Garthwaite till you hear farther from me. I will write Sandy or some of them by the post, or else by the carrier&#x2014;some day next week; and then it will be time enough. In the mean while, you will be thankful with me that I am well, and that (as Father&#x2019;s letter shews) I have the rational prospect of being happy and busy all winter. How many thousands would envy my lot! I ought to be, and hope I am, contented.</p>
<p>The good Mrs Swan was preaching up that doctrine to me largely yesterday, when I saw her for the second time. She seems to be a most amiable little woman; and I purpose visiting her whenever I have an opportunity. We got acquainted in about ten minutes&#x2014;whenever she heard me speak about my mother. She told me all her moving history forthwith; how she lost the parent who had <hi rend="italic">only</hi> nursed her; how a step-moth<supplied>[er]</supplied> used her ill, and kept her six long years by various machinations from marrying a worthy honest young man who loved her well; how David and she were at
length united, and lived five years together happy as unbroken affection could make them; and lastly how she lost him suddenly a few months ago, and was left behind with an embarrassed fortune, and one little boy&#x2014;for whom alone she desires to live. &#x2018;But what&#x2019; said the cheery little body &#x2018;are the light afflictions of this life which are but for a moment, if they work together a far more eternal and exceeding weight of glory?&#x2019; I admired her fortitude and humble patience. She said I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> return to the minister-office; lay aside vanities, be submissive &#x26;c; all of which things I told her you had often inculcated upon me; Whereto she made answer that she wished to join with you in so good a work. I do like to see such a person: it is better than all the cold pitiful sages in the universe.</p>
<p>But My dear Mother, I must away. I have said nothing in this letter, nothing at all: I will write again very soon, and be more explicit. I cannot conclude without conjuring you to take care of yourself, during the hard task that will be allotted you during winter. O! take care. What is all the world to us without you? Go down the house <hi rend="italic">every</hi> night, and make yourself a comfortable <hi rend="italic">dreg</hi>. You shall never, never want any thing you need&#x2014;if it please <hi rend="italic">Him</hi>, who cares for us all. <closer><salute>Good night, My dear Mother!&#x2014; I am ever your&#x2019;s</salute></closer></p>
<name>Thomas Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>My kindest affection to all about home: to Mag and James and Mary and Jane and Jenny. <hi rend="italic">All</hi> of them that <hi rend="italic">can</hi> write a stroke must write to me. Sandy will write by Garthwaite&#x2014;directed to Mrs Robertson&#x2019;s&#x2014;who <pb id="pg-01-395" n="01:395"/>knows where I am. <closer><salute>Farewell.

<salute>My dear Father,</salute>
<p>I was extremely glad to-day on passing along the North Bridge to see the countenance of Parliament Geordie [Dr. Little<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1821-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref></note>], all in the Annandale style:&#x2014;not so much on his own account (for the man had little to say of importance), as because it afforded me an opportunity of writing to you, which I felt no less anxious to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> than you to <hi rend="italic">suffer</hi>. I could write but a very hurried and vague epistle to Sandy on the former occasion; and I was within an inch of missing the chance of sending even that, Garthwaite being already under way, when I met him with it in my hand. So I daresay you will open this sheet with an additional portion of eagerness.</p>
<p>It struck me also that <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Doctor might be a convenient means of enabling me to execute a small project which I have meditated for a while,&#x2014;the project of sending my mother and you, each a pair of spectacles. You will find them wrapt up in the accompanying parcel. Yours I need not say are the silver ones: and I beg you to accept them as a slight memorial of the grateful affection, with which both conscience and inclination must always constrain me to regard you. This is the first thing, I believe, you ever got from me; and tho&#x2019;a trifle, I know it will be ac<supplied>[ceptab]</supplied>le as coming from such a quarter. It affords a true delight to me to think, that, perhaps I may thus add a little to the comfort of one, to whom I myself owe sight and life and all that makes them worth enjoying. I often think, particularly on leaving Home, how blessed I am, amid all my sorrows, that my parents are yet both alive to love me and care for me; that I can think of them not only without abashment, but with a proud exultation&#x2014;as ornaments&#x2014;both by their talents and their conduct&#x2014;to the honest station, which they have long occupied &#x26; will yet long, long occupy as becomes them. Have I not, <pb id="pg-01-396" n="01:396"/>I may well exclaim, still some to love, still <hi rend="italic">where</hi> to lay my head, whatever may betide? Few, very few are so happy.</p>
<p>I have almost forgot to say that if the glasses do not suit exactly;&#x2014;observe merely whether you need to hold the book, or other object, <hi rend="italic">too near</hi> or <hi rend="italic">too far</hi> from the eye; write this down to me pointedly; and send the spectacles up to me by Garthwaite, that the fault may be remedied. They can put in a pair of new sights in five minutes, and I have bargained that it shall be no additional expence. In fact the <hi rend="italic">present sights</hi> were put in to suit my description, and the man told me that as they grew too young, it was the custom to get them changed <hi rend="italic">regularly</hi>. See therefore, that you are properly fitted&#x2014;since alteration can be made so easily.&#x2014; But I am filling my paper w<supplied>[i]</supplied>th this poor affair, when there is so much else to talk about. Let me leave it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For a further discussion of the spectacles and what they meant to Carlyle&#x2019;s father, see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 50. The word <hi rend="italic">young</hi> when applied to <hi rend="italic">sights</hi> or lenses meant of low magnifying power.</note></p>
<p>Things look as if they would go smoothly with me, this winter. I saw Brewster the other day, who received me kindly, and spread out his bank-draught for fifteen guineas, like a man. The other things<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably, articles for Brewster&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</hi>.</note> had not been waited-for at all. He told me farther that a translation was <hi rend="italic">for certain</hi> to be set about, and that I as certainly should have the first offer of it. The work is a French one, <hi rend="italic">Legendre&#x2019;s</hi> Elements of Geometry&#x2014;which Jack knows well and has in his possession. It is a thing I can work at, if the <hi rend="italic">gea</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Gae</hi>, the rush and movement.</note> <hi rend="italic">of life</hi> be in me at all; and for that cause alone I purpose to accept it. There is plenty of Encyclopedia work besides: and the worthy Review-men seem to the full as desirous that I should write for them as I am willing to write for any thing in honour that will pay me well. That poor <hi rend="italic">article</hi>, which you saw, has done me some good, I find already. They had me to dine along with about a half-score of professed critics last night. The innocent Editor, our Landlord, was most officious&#x2014;produced excellent stuff to eat and drink, and compliments in abundance. James Simpson<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), who wrote <hi rend="italic">A Visit to Flanders and the Field of Waterloo</hi> (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>).</note> author of a visit to Waterloo, which I remember reading to you and <hi rend="italic">Heezlie</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s mother was the daughter of John Aitken, farmer of Heazlibrae, in Kirkmichael. Scottish farmers are frequently referred to by the names of their farms, and perhaps in this instance the farm provided Mrs. Carlyle or some member of her family with a nickname.</note> six years ago, was of the party. He is a good-natured, vapouring, simpering, very shallow man. So are they mostly&#x2014;all very shallow&#x2014;at least pretty shallow&#x2014;and almost all very good-humoured. <pb id="pg-01-397" n="01:397"/>They were keenly solicitous, at least they said so, that I should continue to write for them; and tho&#x2019; I respect neither them nor their cause among the highest, I have thoughts of complying for a time;&#x2014;if they pay well, that is,&#x2014;of which I have yet had no proof. From the whole of this, my dear Father will be happy to conclude that I am free of danger&#x2014;if I keep a sound body; which I shall surely to a certain extent, or if no precaution will serve, I will return to my own climate again.</p>
<p>I designed to write Jack every night this week; but have failed. Tell him to look for a letter by the post&#x2014;in a day or two. Alick is in my debt: but I will have him deeper in it ere long. You must write me the very first evening you have leisure: it will be a wholesome exercise to yourself, and a grateful treat to me. <closer><salute>I am ever,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I was proceeding along Prince&#x2019;s-street, to-day about 2 o&#x2019;clock in the company of that &#x201C;hard character,&#x201D; Cron of Scaills,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Cron (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>) was a student friend and contemporary of Carlyle at Edinburgh. He graduated M.A. on <date when="1816-01-04">4 Jan. 1816</date>, and though Carlyle describes him as a &#x201C;preacher&#x201D; he was not a minister of the Church of Scotland. In <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date> he enrolled as a medical student in Edinburgh, but in <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date> he caught typhus fever, presumably from his patients, and died in Edinburgh on <date when="1827-02-16">16 Feb. 1827</date>. Carlyle&#x2019;s notice of him appears in the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> for <date when="1827-02-27">27 Feb.</date></note> when my eye fortunately caught the acceptable figure of Thomas Garthwaite. He consigned to me our Mother&#x2019;s spectacles; could find no letters; and promised to send up the box, which he thought contained some, in a very short time. It has not arrived yet: but the hurry about it is smaller, as I had not left Thomas many paces, till by a very natural process, I discovered what I was in quest of, by undoing the cover of my little parcel. So I proceeded right onwards&#x2014;reading as I went&#x2014;to the Optician&#x2019;s with the spectacles; engaged to call for them about dusk; and am now down to scribble you a line or two in the interim.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-398" n="01:398"/>I need not say that I am very much gratified by your letter, and the friendly sentiments and inquiries which it expresses. There is a good deal of consolation in the thought, that if few like us, those few like us <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, and will stand true by us <hi rend="italic">forever</hi>: and it is a thought too which should not lie barren within us; but operate as a fresh stimulus to make us if possible justify their partiality, by a conduct full of gratitude to our favourers, and of upright independence towards all men. I considered, on ascending Middlebie <foreign><hi rend="italic">brae</hi></foreign>, that day we went to Waterbeck, what a brave thing it was, that here were <hi rend="italic">we three</hi>, firm fellows, all brethren arrived at manhood, the sons of honest parents, ourselves without a stain: and I prophesied within myself that a day would come when we should be still more proud to call each other brethren, and give still more comfort (perhaps) to those that own us. I am still full of these hopes; and I know no better&#x2014;indeed no other, way to realise them, than by acting as we have endeavoured to do hitherto&#x2014;with diligence in business and fervency in spirit, towa<supplied>[r]</supplied>ds every thing within our reach that is manly or becoming. But wherefore darken counsel by words without wisdom?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 35:16; <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, iii.</note> Those speculations are familiar to every person of reflection: you understand them as well as I. Turn we to more plain matters.</p>
<p>And upon this head I need not extend largely. Nothing novel has occurred since I wrote last so fully&#x2014;not even a change in my lodgings. This latter event must however take place shortly, for my room is let to a person who enters it on Saturday evening. This intimation of my intentions to the poor little body of a landlady I thought it but fair to make, and she received it very decently. In fact I could not stay. Besides the noise of masons, dog-fights, cat-squallings, carpet-beatings, my evenings were annoyed by the coughing of a poor girl directly below my bed who, I unfortunately learned, was dying of Consumption. You cannot conceive how much this afflicts me. But the little woman is very cleanly, and very attentive, and the place is finely aired: and as there is a front-room free from most of these inconveniences, I think it is likely the body and I may agree about it, and make the rent suit; in which case I shall only have to shift about six yards. Mrs Swan<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. David Swan.

I got only &#xa3;50 for my entire trouble in that <hi rend="italic">Legendre</hi>, and had already ceased to be in the least proud of <hi rend="italic">Mathematical</hi> prowess; but it was an honest job of work honestly done &#x2026;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 105&#x2013;6).</note> for it will go on certainly. &#x201C;I shall do it.&#x201D; But I have got no desk yet, no &#x2014;&#x2014;, no &#x26;c &#x26;c. Expect however to learn that I <supplied>[shall be]</supplied> consid<supplied>[erably]</supplied> underway next time I write&#x2014;in spite of all these wants.

<p>I was in such a haste to-day that when the porter arrived with the letter, I was obliged to <foreign><hi rend="italic">hush</hi></foreign> [quickly throw] in several things into the box &#x26; dispatch it without any letter by the bearer of Sandy&#x2019;s parcel, in order to save two journeys&#x2014;for Jamaica Street is about a mile from where Garthwaite stays.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jamaica St. is on the north side of Edinburgh.

I was greatly obliged by the cakes&#x2014;which from their excellence I judged that you had baked. I get brown bread here, however; and find it very good. Sandy would tell you, how I have been tossed and disappointed in regard to lodgings, and so prevented from doing any thing; &#x26; finally how I am settled and design to lay about me strongly.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-401" n="01:401"/>This period of comparative idleness, has done me some good, however: I have kept stamping and walking up and down the streets; and by so doing, I have not a little improved the state of my <hi rend="italic">inside</hi>.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have but a few minutes to give you at present; but here is a little Sovereign, which I got a while ago, and must write three words along with, ere I send it you. It is to keep the Fiend out of your Housewife (<foreign>Huzzy</foreign>)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Needle-case.</note> in these hard times, and to get little odds and ends with in due time. If I were beside you, I should have to encounter no little molestation, before I could prevail upon you to accept this most small matter: but being at the safe distance of 70 miles, I fear it not. You would tell me I am poor &#x26; have so few myself of those coins. But I am going to have plenty by and by: and if I had but one, I c<supplied>[an]</supplied>not see how I could purchase more enjoyment with it, than if I shared it with you. Be not in want of any thing, I entreat you, that I can possibly get for you. It would be hard indeed, if in the Autumn of a life, the spring and summer of which you have spent well, in taking care of us, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> should know what could add to your frugal enjoyments, and not procure it. Ask me, ask me for something.</p>
<p>I am very busy at present, as Alick will tell you; and therefore moderately happy. If health were added&#x2014; But there is always some <hi rend="italic">if</hi>. In fact I ought not to complain, even on this latter score. I think I am <pb id="pg-01-402" n="01:402"/>at least <hi rend="italic">where I was</hi>, when you saw me: perhaps better on the whole; and I hope frosty weather is coming, which will make me better still. The other day I saw one of my constant walks last Summer; and I could not help accusing myself of ingratitude to the Giver of all good, for the great recovery I have experienced, since then.</p>
<p>I intend to labour as hard as possible throughout the winter, finding nothing to be so useful for me every way. I shall make occasional excursions into the country, by way of relaxation. I think of going to Kirk<supplied>[c]</supplied>aldy (whither I am bidden) for a day or two about Christmas: and I have a standing invitation, from a very excellent Mrs Welsh, to go to Haddington, often, as if I were going <hi rend="italic">home</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the few references to the Welshes in the letters to his family. By now Mrs. Welsh seems to have regretted her invitation.</note> This is very <hi rend="italic">pleasant</hi>, as Habank said.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a reference to an anecdote well known in the neighborhood of Mainhill involving Johnston at Ha'bank.

<p>My Father is to write me next time: and what hinders Mag and M<supplied>[ary]</supplied> and James the Ploughman? I shall <supplied>[be]</supplied> very angry with them, if they keep such silence. Tell them so, one and all. My love to Jean and Jenny: they cannot write, or they would. I long to hear of your own welfare, My dear Mother, particularly of your health, which costs me many a thought. <closer><salute>I am always, Your affectionate Son,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have about half an hour in which to scribble you a few lines; and I gladly devote it to your service. Only I fear there is little probability that this epistle will do more for you in the way of information than the last did&#x2014;seeing I must write it in a period of the greatest hurry, at a stranger&#x2019;s house (the house of George Dalgliesh), and placed so that I am obliged, every second instant, to turn over my shoulder and <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> to that celebrated Jurisconsult.&#x2014; The fact is, I have very little that is fresh to communicate. Since I wrote last, my life has glided on idly, I doing nothing&#x2014;except perhaps read a little&#x2014;and waiting patiently for some <hi rend="italic">final</hi> arrangement about a Lodging. There never was the like of this! I have been three weeks here now, and <pb id="pg-01-403" n="01:403"/>never in a home, or aught resembling a home. The first room would not do, and was indeed let to another; the second of the woman Simm&#x2019;s proved intolerably cold, and was let&#x2014;at the easy rate of 12 shillings a week. Then Mrs Swan (the good body of whom I wrote to my Mother) talked of boarding me; and she had to correspond with the people of Kirk<supplied>[c]</supplied>aldy on the subject, and to talk and arrange&#x2014;and in brief, to detain me above a week in waiting. So that (would you believe it?) I am only settled in a permanent lodging about an hour ago! This is the cause of my hurry. The room I have got, I call <hi rend="italic">permanent</hi>; for I imagine it will answer, tho&#x2019; it is confoundedly dear&#x2014;no less than 9/6 per week: but I could not make a better of it, and as I liked the physiognomy of the Landlady I brigued and haggled with her till she came <hi rend="italic">down</hi> from 12/ to this sum. I threw in my luggage forthwith; and having to go into the old Town for a book, I took shelter in the Jurist&#x2019;s to write you this most beggarly scrawl&#x2014;for Garthwaite is going out almost presently, and this spot is about a mile nearer him than my lodging. Excuse all blunders, My dear Alick, and write me very largely <hi rend="italic">next time</hi>: The address is Mrs Sherlock&#x2019;s 9. Jamaica-street,&#x2014;directly below where I have lived all this time&#x2014;only in front and two stairs nearer the ground. It looks warm and very clean and snug&#x2014;I shall not hear the poor Consumptive girl; and the air about it is incomparably the best in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Therefore I doubt not I shall be comfortable in it.</p>
<p>My employments, you may well suppose, are nearly in the state they were a month ago. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ad-a-rat-eet</hi></foreign> [drat it]! they shall not be so long now. I am teaching an <hi rend="italic">hour</hi>, as the dogs call it,&#x2014;and have another at my option&#x2014;if it will suit. Also Swan&#x2019;s boy&#x2014;whom I am going to attend daily,&#x2014;for his father&#x2019;s sake. But teaching is not the thing I want&#x2014;I must live by another implement in the mean time:&#x2014;and for the future&#x2014;I tell you Alick, there <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be something done&#x2014;something great&#x2014;if I should perish in att<supplied>[ain]</supplied>ing it. &#x201C;Then, then, ye sturdy ploughmen, our song a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> feast shall flow to the fame &#x26;c<supplied>[.]</supplied>&#x201D;</p>
<p>My dear Brother, I feel my heart melted, when I think of you all at home, and how you have loved me, and borne with me. I trust you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not have cause to repent that you have done so.&#x2014; My Father and Mother are very good to be delighted with so small a matter; I wish it were a greater for their sake. It gives me great pleasure to learn that you are all so calm &#x26; happy at Mainhill: continue to progress along your solid honest course, and every thing will be as it should. What length are you in Cobbett? Stick to it stoutly: you cannot fail to <pb id="pg-01-404" n="01:404"/>master it. Look what you are <hi rend="italic">now</hi> and what you were two years ago! Perseverance will absolutely master &#x201C;almost <hi rend="italic">any</hi> thing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>What ails all the <hi rend="italic">wee</hi> things that they do not write to me? Mag and Jemmy &#x26; Mary &#x26; Jane &#x26; all of them? They <hi rend="italic">must</hi> write next time. Yourself by <hi rend="italic">all</hi> means.&#x2014; Will you ask Jack to look among the German books for &#x201C;Don Karlos&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Schiller&#x2019;s play <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos</hi> (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>).</note> and to send it? There are two books in the box for him. <closer><salute>I am ever,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I had been meditating very often lately to write you a most circumstantial and luminous account of all my proceedings and feelings since I left our native dale; but some paltry obstacle or other still came in the way, and, but for the opportune arrival of your letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1821-12-04">4 Dec.</date></note> to-day, it seems rather doubtful if I should have effected my purpose till the ensuing week&#x2014;if even then. I am very blameable or very unfortunate or both: but I cannot help it now, and it may be some palliation of <pb id="pg-01-405" n="01:405"/>my offence to mention the fact, that I have not written a single line to any creature except Mainhill people since my arrival, and that hence if my negligence has originated from unkindness, I may be inferred to have totally lost the feeling of friendship for any man or woman. &#x201C;But this is absurd, and therefore&#x201D;&#x2014; According to the usual mode in <hi rend="italic">indirect demonstrations</hi>, a thing well known to you. A more satisfactory way of putting the matter, however, is to <hi rend="italic">resolve resolutely</hi> that such a case shall not occur again: and certainly as the cause is not likely to reappear shortly, my force of will has some likelihood of coming off victorious on this occasion. In truth, my Dear Jack, I have need of small volition in the matter of writing to you: it is a thing so grateful to the inner man, that really <hi rend="italic">resolving</hi> that I will write to you is little better than <hi rend="italic">resolving</hi> that I will consume a dish or two of tea tomorrow morning. So long as I continue in the world I shall be hungry in the mornings to a certainty; and to an equally emphatic certainty I shall feel as hungered in the soul when difficulties and distress beset it, and long to apply the only remedy&#x2014;the sympathy of a true and brotherly heart, which I am sure Jack will always bear towards me. If things prosper with us, boy, we shall be a rare treasure to each other. How many kings would offer all their diadems in vain for one single <hi rend="italic">friend</hi>! I myself have more than one, who will never, never fail me.</p>
<p>Nor am I any way dubious, Jack, about our ultimate success in life. Things are beginning to wear a somewhat brighter aspect with me; and I sometimes think the bitterest of life (it has been bitter enough!) is already past. As for you, the road is plainer. You have a brother before you to make it smoother, or at least to warn you of its roughness; your mind is of a more solid stoical cast; and your capacity of perseverance might set you above fear&#x2014;with even the most mediocre talents. Jack&#x2019;s talents, however, are not mediocre. I have examined many minds and I do not recollect of seeing one against which I would fear to match his. This is not to make you vain; but simply to console you, when shallow persons treat you with some disrespect, with the persuasion that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> day <hi rend="italic">is</hi> coming. For the rest, it is not necessary that you should habitually be conscious of your intellectual worth. Study as if you were duller than a Dutchman; and act and walk in ordinary cases with a similar modesty. People will love you far better, and honour you but a very little less only, within the secret cell of your own heart, know that you are made for something finer than to eat and drink and teach Arithmetic. Let this conviction be as a lamp <pb id="pg-01-406" n="01:406"/>to your path, when gloomy weather is perchance upon it, or when low temptations are on this side of it and that. I give you advices tediously; but I have no fear that they will be greatly needed: you are a quiet good boy; and al<supplied>[l]</supplied> will turn out well.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep your resolution of writing to me <hi rend="italic">very frequently</hi>. Believe me Jack, I get scarcely any letter which I like to see as well as yours. You are vastly improved in the epistolary art, since last year: but this is a smaller consideration. When you write to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, take no thought what you shall say. Nonsense will do as well as any thing&#x2014;if it be honest nonsense coming from the heart. I wish you had seen how I enjoyed your epistle of to-day. Our excellent parents!&#x2014;how I do rejoice in the thought of making them happy even for a moment! Be good to them Jack: there is nothing, as you well say, equal to &#x201C;doing one&#x2019;s parents a pleasure.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quoted from John&#x2019;s letter.</note> Remember our Mother in particular. <hi rend="italic">Keep her at the tea</hi>: it does her good, and who deserves it better?</p>
<p>I have said nothing about my own goings, which are in fact very unimportant. I am thinking to take another <hi rend="italic">hour</hi> of teaching (mathematics) on Monday: it is between 10 and 11 o&#x2019;clock, and so just succeeds the present one between 9 and 10.

I am still clear for the <hi rend="italic">stated hours</hi> you recommended.

Then my own <hi rend="italic">book</hi>, Jack, my own!</p>
<p>Now you must be doing with what you have got here; and write again very soon. I forgot to speak of health: but my very silence would have told you that I ailed little. I have not been so well for a year. My love to all at Mainhill&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Tell</hi> them to write. <closer><salute>Ever your&#x2019;s</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I fear you have this night undergone a considerable disappointment. Your most lively and cheering epistle<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John&#x2019;s letter was dated <date when="1821-12-04">4 Dec.</date> He had written: &#x201C;I had almost forgot to tell you that B. Nelson has his compliments to you, and desires that you would procure for him on receipt of this l'abbe Tardy&#x2019;s pronouncing dictionary and send it down with the carrier.&#x201D; TC received it on <date when="1821-12-08">8 Dec.</date> (Saturday) and wrote a letter to John on the same day. But this letter does not seem to have been posted at the time; as a matter of fact the letter of <date when="1821-12-11">11 Dec.</date> was sent first, and the letter of <date when="1821-12-08">8 Dec.</date> was sent later with the book parcel.</note> came to hand in the afternoon of Saturday; and I had no sooner devoured its contents, than I proceeded into the city to execute the commission which it contained. Returning with the Abb&#xE9; Tardy<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">An Explanatory Pronouncing Dictionary of the French Language in French and English</hi> (London, <date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>), by l'Abb&#xE9; Tardy.</note> in my pocket, I forthwith set myself to scribble you a very long-winded letter; and having finished three quarto pages and a half in this sort, it only remained for me to travel southward again to the Grass-market,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An area in Edinburgh from which the carriers departed.</note> that I might entrust the parcel to our trusty <foreign><hi rend="italic">Lemuadromus</hi></foreign> [ghostly messenger from a Spartan race-course] Guyon, vulgarly denominated Gavin the Carrier of Annan. Alas! I had calculated wrong; Guyon was away; and I came thoughtfully back, determined since no better might be, to reserve the Dictionary with the attendant epistle for a more suitable opportunity; and in the mean while to despatch you intelligence by the Post, that no uneasiness might ensue. The first part of my resolution has been punctually adhered to, and you shall have the packet (Tell Ben) whenever Garthwaite appears: the second part I am even now executing&#x2014;thus late, because I am a negligent dog, and a number of trifling matters acted on me &#x26; aggravated my sloth. I need not particularize them: you are a good soul and will forgive me.</p>
<p>My dear Jack, I send many a thought southward to you. Often in the mind&#x2019;s eye you appear seated at your mahogany <hi rend="italic">tippet</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written that he was sitting at a &#x201C;tippit-table.&#x201D;</note> with the various accoutrements of a solitary student, labouring in secret at the task, which (fear it not, my boy!) will yet be rewarded openly. Few such quiet things in Nature have so much of the sublime in them as the spectacle of a poor but honourable-minded youth, with discouragement all around him but never-dying hope within his heart, forging, <pb id="pg-01-408" n="01:408"/>as it were, the armour with which he is destined to resist and overcome the hydras of this world and conquer for himself in due time, a habitation among the sunny fields of life. Like every other virtue, this effort may almost be called its own reward, even tho&#x2019; success should never crown it. How poor, how beggar-poor, compared with this, is the vulgar, rioting, dandyish, punch-drinking, oyster-eating existence often led by your borough Procurator, or embryo Provost! Truly, Jack, you have chosen the <hi rend="italic">better part</hi>: and as your brother I rejoice to see you persevere in it. Only remember that there is another extreme in which you may err almost as fatally, tho&#x2019; not so basely; and take warning while there is yet time to shun it. You know what I allude to; and also that I have a <hi rend="italic">sad right</hi> to be anxious on that score. Go often out,&#x2014;to Ben your friend every night, and talk long with him; visit Mainhill almost every Saturday; and <hi rend="italic">let nothing sit heavy on your heart without communicating it</hi>. Solitary grief is worst of all. Tell me every thing. Am not I your Mentor? And could I help liking you, even tho&#x2019; Nature had not made us brothers? There is no hurry whatever: long before next winter you will be well qualified to make a figure in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;where by the blessing of Heaven you shall not again fail of presenting yourself. So fear no weather, Jack: Fortune favours the brave; and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">integer vitae</hi></foreign> (as Horace will have told you) <foreign><hi rend="italic">scelerisque purus non eget Mauris jaculis neque arcu</hi></foreign><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;He who is uncorrupted of life and pure from evil needs not Moorish darts or bow&#x201D; (Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi>, I, 22, 1&#x2013;2).</note>&#x2014;nor any thing else in fact&#x2014;utterly.</p>
<p>I perused, with deep interest and pleasure, your graphic account of the style, in which our Father received the spectacles.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written that they were all glad when TC sent his father the spectacles, that the old man wondered &#x201C;what in the name o' wonder tempit the fallow to lay out his money i' buying him sic gran' silver spectacles&#x201D; but was highly flattered by the compliment and unexpected mark of attention, that he was not slow in showing the spectacles to all the other members of the family, saying, &#x201C;Sees te sic a per o' fine spectacles as Tom has sen' me?&#x2014; Thy mother has got a per too.&#x201D; &#x201C;Ay they <hi rend="italic">ir</hi> very fine how do they answer?&#x201D; &#x201C;Just excellently!&#x2014; We gat them fre Parliament Geordy as we came down. &#x2026; This is a kin' o' rewaird for the expence 'at his edication has cost me.&#x201D; John says that he then &#x201C;gathered up his lips <hi rend="italic">fippling</hi> to suppress the rising tear.&#x201D;</note> It is a cheap way of purchasing pleasure to make those that love us happy at so small an expense. Go up with my kind and heartfelt wishes to all of them, Mother &#x26; Father, Alick and all, next saturday. Say I am greatly behindhand with them in the matter of writing, tho&#x2019; not in affection: but I shall do exploits henceforth in that line. I am going to live in <pb id="pg-01-409" n="01:409"/>the South<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >College St. is beside the university and on the southern side of Edinburgh.</note> to-morrow, where they may send me boxes of cakes and letters by the dozen, and get replies in proportion. This fluctuation of lodgings will surprise you: but I trust the present change will be the last. This Sherlock&#x2019;s room (in which I now write) was entrusted almost solely to the care of a servant, and proved so noisy that, when I went to sleep, it seemed as if I had lain down to take sweet rest in the centre of a fulling-mill. Besides she began to talk about my smoking, forsooth, and modestly requested me to give it up, for it spoiled the room. Whereupon I instantly calmed her heart, by professing my extreme willingness to evacuate <hi rend="italic">the</hi> room for ever and a day. This happened about dusk; and an hour ago, I hired a fine place in College-street no. 5, of one Mrs Cusine (with whom Dobie and George Little&#x2019;s<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18211117-TC-JCE-01">TC to <sic>JC, the elder</sic><corr>JCE</corr>, <date when="1821-11-17">17 Nov.</date></ref></note> boys stay&#x2014;much to their mind) for 8/ per week: and as all seems right, I expect to continue there<supplied>[.]</supplied> In other respects I am well; moderately healthy (far better than usual) and one way with another very happy&#x2014;at least for a time. I began a kind of specimen of Legendre to-day&#x2014;which they want to print and fin<supplied>[d]</supplied> the costs of all the work thereby.

<salute>My dear Johnstone,</salute>
<p>If ever you are at the pains to think of me at all, it must be as of a very negligent and untrustworthy creature. I daresay you did not anticipate at our parting that I should be so late in making inquiries after you: and had things turned out as we expected then, I should certainly merit great blame for what appears to be so unfriendly a line of proceeding. Nevertheless I shall have no great difficulty in framing a satisfactory apology. Since the Saturday when I saw you lodged on the Coach-roof, and whirled away at the rate of seven miles an hour <pb id="pg-01-411" n="01:411"/>into the West, you must know, my condition has been little better than that of the Indian bird, which, being destitute of legs, is constrained (poor fowl!) to pass its time forever on the wing. I have drifted and flitted about almost incessantly, taking to no settled employment because <supplied>[of]</supplied> perpetually changing my place of abode, or perpetually expecting to change it: and it was only last Wednesday that I landed here, or have had any thing like the prospect of passing the winter in my existing position. So, how could I send you my address? Nay so anxious was I to exert every nerve in fulfilling this duty, that last week tho&#x2019; still unsettled, in writing to Irving I requested him to let you know my news and desire you to take measures for commencing our correspondence under the actual auspices however adverse. Irving confessed to me the other night that he had forgot this commission; and as the account he was able to give me of your residence amounted only to what you see on the back of this sheet, no small dexterity as well as zeal was required to make me accomplish even the slender task, which I have now commenced. I trust however you will get this fairly, will write to me immediately on reading it, and be ready to receive forthwith a more explicit epistle&#x2014;and better directed than &#x201C;next door to Smith the Booksellers.&#x201D; This is not perhaps quite satisfactory; but &#x201C;what man could do is done&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns, &#x201C;It Was A' for Our Rightfu' King.&#x201D;</note> to make it so.</p>
<p>I have made so tedious a preface, that scarcely any space remains for the main body of the work; and this letter I fear must look, when finished, little better than if an architect were to erect a porch high as the Ram&#x2019;s Horn of Glasgow<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to one of the largest churches in Glasgow, St. David&#x2019;s or the Ramshorn Church.</note> to conduct into a dog-hutch, his edifice would look. It is necessity, you see, that urges me. And possibly, in truth, I ought to rend it as a happy necessity: for what in the world could I interest you with, tho my sheet were broad as the Atlantic and long in proportion? I have had few happy feelings or sad of my own which I can communicate to you; and I am sick to loathing of the criticisms on College Professors, or &#x2018;Cain a Mystery by Lord Byron,&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published in <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>.</note> or <hi rend="italic">the Galloway Stot, I mean Macculloch&#x2019;s</hi> Lectures on Political Economy<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200612-TC-JOFE-01">TC to <sic>JF</sic><corr>JOFE</corr>, <date when="1820-06-12">12</date> or <date when="1820-06-17">17 June 1820</date></ref>; <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1821-01-10">10 Jan. 1821</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221204-TC-AC-01"><date when="1822-12-04">4 Dec. 1822</date></ref>.</note> (delivered, or to be so, to a crowded audience&#x2014;of eleven), or any of the other garbage, with which &#x201C;the general&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;For the play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, II, ii).</note> here delight <pb id="pg-01-412" n="01:412"/>themselves. Next time I write I shall be over head and ears in a translation of Legendre&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">El&#xE9;ments de G&#xE9;ometrie</hi> (this is under the rose) which I have partly engaged to execute for a kind of embryo society for the encouragement of the Arts, as it calls itself, in Edinburgh<supplied>[.]</supplied> Also I shall be writing various trash for Reviews and Encyc<supplied>[lope]</supplied>dias; and meditating stoutly on commencing some <foreign><hi rend="italic">Opus</hi> <supplied>[<hi rend="italic">Mag</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">num</hi></foreign> of my own, which I fear will prove equal trash. I mention this <foreign><hi rend="italic">Opus Magnum</hi></foreign>, because I wish you to reproach me, if I do not try at least to perform it. At present I am teaching two or three hours daily, to keep the purse (base destiny, that Man, the paragon of Animals,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, II, ii.</note> should need a purse!) from becoming altogether a nonentity. My pupils are learning Mathematics, Metaphysics, Languages; and are all moderately stupid: but they keep very civil, and the stupidity is their own affair&#x2014;not mine. I get plenty of talk, but no society, in this &#x201C;intellectual&#x201D; town: one learns to do without society; and as I am not <hi rend="italic">very</hi> unhealthy, I cannot complain of being quite unhappy.</p>
<p>Now in return for this lucid exposition of my concerns, what have you to tell me about yours? What studies are you following and with what relish? Is the Irish business settled? In general, what occupation have you for the present, what hope for the future? It is still one of the few topics to which I do not feel indifferent, and I beg of you to dilate upon it largely. I expect your letter earnestly for various reasons. One is that I may have an opportunity to make amends in some degree for the arid barrenness of my present exhibition. This day is <supplied>[one]</supplied> of our worst days in the smoky city. It resembles a day on the shores of Acheron more than any Christian place. <closer><salute>It is this which acts upon me principally, for there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> some truth in me still&#x2014;at any rate when I subscribe myself&#x2014;Your sincere friend,</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle.</name></p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>There seems to be something peculiarly untoward in your movements &#x26; mine, of late, as viewed on connexion with each other. You had left Annandale about a fortnight before my arrival; and you returned to it just <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of time to let me know what might have been the <pb id="pg-01-413" n="01:413"/>very joyful fact of your presence there. The kind note<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> containing this latter piece of intelligence only reached me, in the regular tardy mode of conveyance, about three weeks ago. I was ignorant of your &#x201C;whereabout,&#x201D; or I would have written to you forthwith. Nay, before leaving home, I had begun a most heroical epistle intended for your perusal, and proceeded so far as the third page in completion of it, when the sad thought struck me that the whole tenor of my observations would too probably but aggravate your feelings, in place of alleviating them, and I wisely committed the unfortunate sheet to its natural destination, the flames. Thank Heaven! you are once more upon your own feet, your resources unimpaired, your character unsullied, or rather more deeply hallowed in the sympathies of all that know you; in a short time, when freed from the many abstractions that have for years so gallingly cramped every effort, you will have it in your power to act with all your natural vigour and sagacity; and <hi rend="italic">Willie</hi> (if I may name my friend so) will yet <foreign><hi rend="italic">rise and waur</hi></foreign> [defeat] <hi rend="italic">them a'</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An allusion to &#x201C;Up and war them a', Willie,&#x201D; a Scots song published in <hi rend="italic">Oswald&#x2019;s Caledonian Pocket Companion</hi> (<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>) and commented on by Burns in the <hi rend="italic">Scots Musical Museum,</hi> IV, 179&#x2013;80.</note> Yes, and soon: neither I, nor those that know for better, doubt it for a moment.</p>
<p>I write at present merely to solicit your address, and beg you to let me have a letter immediately&#x2014;that is as soon as <hi rend="italic">possible</hi>. Irving (alas!) is now in great part lost to both of us; at least the daily visitations of his benign friendliness must be denied us for a period of indefinate length: and does it not behove the <hi rend="italic">survivors</hi> to stick even more closely together on this account? I hold that there is no finer thing in Nature than to pour out the feelings of one&#x2019;s heart into another heart that loves us; to sit down to a fair sheet, when distance forbids the tongue its office, and take up your pen with a determination to put out all kinds of matter&#x2014;nonsense or sense, no matter which&#x2014;with the certainty that whatever comes from that quarter, nonsense or sense as it may happen, will excite some pleasing interest in the quarter whither it is going. I beg you will adopt this opinion and act upon it towards me permanently and without delay. I will tell you all my outgoings and incomings, my translations, and compilings and composings, all the poor things I do and the great things I intend, with the utmost punctuality if you give the proper encouragement. <closer><salute>You know what is proper encouragement in such a case; and need not be assured that I remain,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Yours most sincerely, /</salute></closer>
<p><name>Thos. Carlyle.</name><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Graham replied on <date when="1822-02-08">8 Feb. 1822</date>: &#x201C;There is more of value to me in that little card of the <date when="1821-12-15">15th December</date> than is to be found in the octavos of most other men; there is a generous philanthropic effort to reconcile me to myself, to life, and to the world; such an outflowing of kindheartedness, that every reading&#x2014;and I have read it often&#x2014;makes me better pleased with you and with myself. &#x2026; &#x201C;By the bye Mr. [Edward] Irving has scarcely mentioned Margaret Gordon!! only that he saw her twice; and something there is like a chilled, or changed feeling. But it is absurd for me to be talking at random on such a matter; only I felt so much interested about that most superior creature, that I looked for a joyous treat on his return from London; but I was disappointed, for poor and scanty has been the feast, or festive description of Margaret! &#x201C;I am very anxious to see Miss Welsh! who I understand is your pupil. My <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary duties</hi> prevented the only chance I ever had; and as another chance may never be mine, I pray you &#x2018;fling me&#x2019; her picture. There is nothing in nature so lovely or interesting as a luminous description of an accomplished female (except the original); so pray you place Miss Welsh in the fore-ground of your next group; and recollect that Dumfriesshire contends for the honour of her birth, or ancestry.&#x201D;</note></p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I learned to-day, almost by accident, that Garthwaite was in Town; and I gladly devote the hour of leisure between dinner and dusk, to clap you down in black and white some partial account of my walk and conversation here, since I wrote last. I have just consumed a solid dinner of beef-steak; and I slept too little last night: so however dull you expect me to be I am sure to prove duller. But what is dulness or sprightliness, when one is writing to a brother? Mere <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>.</p>
<p>I came over into this room just a week ago: I believe it <supplied>[will]</supplied> do. The place is open, but in the centre of the town, and thus not so well-aired; it is also <hi rend="italic">enlivened</hi> by the sound of ten thousand carts and coaches&#x2014;which, however, do me very little ill; nor is it any of the warmest up-putting. Still it is an elegant large apartment; and the people are very decent seemingly: so it will do I believe, for the winter. Cusine (poor soul!) has been fleeced to the bare back by Irish students and the like going off with unpaid scores; so she intends leaving Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at Whitsunday: I shall then go back to Robertson, who purposes taking a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> house, in some pleasant part of the city, and will be very glad to receive me. Now let us hope, My dear Alick, that this most pitiful of all subjects, the subject of room-taking, with which I have so long deafened your friendly ear, may henceforth sleep&#x2014;till doomsday, if it might be; but for one twelvemonth any way!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-01-415" n="01:415"/>Within a few days, I have set fairly to work, and am proceeding lustily; not in the whimpering, wavering, feeble, hobbling style I used; but stoutly as a man cutting <foreign><hi rend="italic">rice</hi></foreign> [rise, brushwood] would wish to do. I rise between seven and eight; if I have got good sleep&#x2014;well; if not&#x2014;well; I then seize my pen and write till the unfortunate people have cooked me a morsel of lukewarm tea for breakfast; and afterwards proceed leisurely to Great King-street in the back of the New Town, where I teach a very sparing portion of Mathematics to two young women and one young man&#x2014;quiet stupid people, with whom I spend my time till ten. Next comes a Captain of the Sea, one Anderson in George-street, not rude and boisterous like the Element he has been used to, but shrill &#x26; smooth-spoken; who gasps and burrs and repeats Euclid to me 'till eleven. On returning home I resume the pen and write till after two; then a walk till three; then dinner and dozing or walking or reading silly stuff or scribbling it (as now) till five, when I go to hear Peter [Patrick] Swan overhaul his lessons; and come back after six to write or read or do whatever I incline. This is a laborious life, but such a one as suits me, and I desingn [design] persisting in it. Nothing in the world gives such scope to discontent as idleness, no matter whether forced or voluntary: a man had better be darning stockings than doing nothing. It is also profitable as well as happy. I calculate on making a small penny this winter; of which my need is not small, as things are, and would have been indispensable, if Thrift had not lent me her aid sometimes. The work at which I am writing is Legendre, the Translation I spoke of. It is a <foreign><hi rend="italic">canny</hi></foreign> job; I could earn five guineas in the week at it, if I were well. I restrict myself to three&#x2014;working four hours each day. The evenings I design to devote to original composition, if I could but gather myself. I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> do something&#x2014;or die, whichever I like better. As to the latter, I have <foreign><hi rend="italic">nae wull o't</hi></foreign> [no inclination toward it], as Curly said, at all.</p>
<p>In this systematic division of my time, I find myself greatly impeded by the want of a proper Chronometer: they have no Clock in the house; and I often feel the want of one. Is the old watch at home still alive? If so, send it me. Or have you sold her, which were as well? In that case, try if by hook or by crook, you can get me any <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> to measure time with, &#x26; send it out by Farries <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>. I care not if it were twin brother to a potatoe-plum in appearance, so it will but wag, and tell me how the hour goes. I beg of you to mind this, for you cannot conceive how I am straitened for the want of the article.</p>
<p>Certainly this sheet has gone away by magic! I had a thousand things to ask about Cobbett, and Mainhill with its ever dear inhabitants, <pb id="pg-01-416" n="01:416"/>and Annandale, and Farries of Stonylee (<hi rend="italic">is</hi> the poor man shot?)&#x2014; And see! the game is done!&#x2014; You will write a full sheet next time, will you not?</p>
<closer><salute>Your brother, /</salute></closer>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>If the very trite observation, that nothing is stationary here below, required any comment, a better one could hardly anywhere be found than my late operations in regard to getting Lodgings. Last time I wrote I mentioned that I thought the place in College-street would <hi rend="italic">do</hi>. Alas! I reckoned without my Host. That very night after I had written, I was aroused by innumerable disturbances overnight, and slept no wink till far in the morning; next night was worse; and when the morning dawned, I seemed fast progressing into that state of horrible nervousness, from which a long residence at Home had with difficulty only in part delivered me. There is no misery out of the Pit of Darkness equal to that of being aroused from sleep&#x2014;perhaps by some drunken blackguard, trolling his obscence catch, as he staggers along the street&#x2014;just at the very instant, when the balmy god is shedding his sweet influence over your exhausted frame. The feeling around one&#x2019;s heart is as if you had planted fifty daggers there all in a moment; and the burning tremor that ensues extends to every fibre of the body. I speak, of course, of nervous persons, poor <hi rend="italic">hypochondriacs</hi>, with whose agonising sensations, a sound plump husbandman is happily secure from having the remotest sympathy.&#x2014; I pondered all these things with no very placid anticipations; and taking into view along with them, the worse than Stygian vapour in which all the Old Town of Edinburgh is almost constantly involved; considering also the sorry entertainment I was like to get from the honest but broken-hearted and overworked Cusines; I unwillingly determined to renew the grievous but now alas! too customary search for fresh lodgin<supplied>[g]</supplied>s. After great perambulations, I found a place between Edinburgh and Leith, in many respects exactly suited to my taste. The street lies behind Leith-Walk, and parallel <pb id="pg-01-417" n="01:417"/>to it; and as I occupy the back part of the house, I hear less noise than I could do in almost any part of the city. And then for air&#x2014; Mainhill itself is but a shade better: I have green fields beneath my very window;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Far from true of this area now, but an interesting description of his new address at 3 Moray St., where he would live for more than a year.</note> and nothing else between me and the Forth. The landlady too is a very cleanly, heartsome little body, who keeps a quiet well-ordered house, having no family, but a boy about five, who does not annoy me much, and a brother, whom I scarcely ever hear. The rent is 8/ per week; and I have two very elegant rooms for the money. My health is considerably restored since I came to the place; and I am as good as determined to continue permanently here. So I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> hope, My dear Alick, that this most tedious topic of lodgings will <hi rend="italic">now</hi> be finally discussed between us, for one season any way. I have tired you with an account of all my removals and all my motives for them; because tho&#x2019; tiresome, I know it is not indifferent to you. Be at rest in regard to me henceforth: in this fine quiet air, enjoying too the advantage of a walk before breakfast (for I am going to make that arrangement with my teaching), being also fortunate in the certainty of abundant employment, and possessing various other sources of comfort which I had not previously, I am warranted to expect a confirmed return of health, and with it of every blessing which a man has reason to hope for in this vale of tears, thro&#x2019; which <supplied>[it]</supplied> is our <supplied>[fa]</supplied>te to wander&#x2014;oft in darkness, sometimes in desponden<supplied>[cy]</supplied>, but if in purity and firm principle&#x2014;sure of a peaceful bed of rest awaiting us at the end. I know nothing, My dear boy, that can make life tolerable, but being virtuous ourselves, and being loved by virtuous people. I speak not of sots, who have nothing in them but a stomach: we are not of such. And is it not a glad thought for us all, that, we love one another, will always love one another, and feel assured that each of us will act in his proper station as the rest and he himself would wish it? For me there is no greater comfort in the world. Long may we all enjoy it!</p>
<p>But the fatal <hi rend="italic">last</hi> page warns me to have done with such speculations. The purpose of my writing is not yet answered; and I must bestir me in it. The object, of course, was to give you my address. It is 3. Moray-street, Leith-Walk (Wilkie&#x2019;s Lodgings): and what I wish you to notice particularly is the excellent convenience the place affords for communication with Home. Moray-street is within a catspring from <supplied>[the r]</supplied>oad our carriers follow in going down to Leith; so they can bring the box to the very door, without any charge of porterage, <pb id="pg-01-418" n="01:418"/>which is often almost equal to the whole other charges. Tell Garthwaite (I have already told Farries) that Moray-street is immediately on his left hand (going down) after he has come thro&#x2019; Leith-Walk Toll-bar. He can leave the box as he goes down, and call for it as he goes up again.&#x2014; My paper is done, boy: but not my love of chatting to you.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have a small slip of paper here, which I may as well fill for you as not, before concluding my epistolary operations for the day. Alick will tell you enough about my shiftings to and fro: so I shall pass that sad subject. Notwithstanding all my ups and downs, however, I have not been idle in my daily labours. I contrived all along to finish my stated quantity of translation<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Legendre.</note> as well as to manage my teaching&#x2014;and thus to comfort myself by the thought of making the way at least as long as the day. Soon I am to begin some Reviews, and some articles for the Encyclopedia. That is to say, in the evenings; for I do not intend neglecting my good mechanical job of Translation, on any except a very pressing account till it is finished. After these Reviews &#x26;c are finished&#x2014;some five weeks hence&#x2014;I must begin&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">the book</hi>. Every body<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Principally Jane Welsh. Clearly the matter had been discussed between them.</note> is pressing as well as you for me to commence forthwith. I wish for the sake of all my friends, and of none more than you&#x2014;tho&#x2019; you care little for such things&#x2014;that I could make this work famous &#x26; to be held in estimation. Alas! that the spirit is so willing, the flesh so weak! However what is <hi rend="italic">in me</hi> I shall do; and the production must be as Providence will have it.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I am slowly gaining ground here, by proceeding in the usual way. I have a great deal more confidence in myself (which you will say I did not want already) than I had last year; and I find people generally disposed to treat me with more respect. I find no person whom I can <hi rend="italic">love</hi> in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>: but many whom I can spend an <pb id="pg-01-419" n="01:419"/>hour of talking with; and that is almost all one gets anywhere. In time I shall fall in more completely.</p>
<p>Tho' my days have been too idly spent since I returned to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I am still under a promise to go over to Fife to speak with Swan<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Provost William Swan.</note> about his boy, and see my old townsmen for a day or two. I am going about Friday; and purpose returning next day after the last of this year. To-day, I am to eat my Christmas dinner with Dr Brewster. And after all these things; I must set to business, and work like a galley-slave. What hope have I else?</p>
<p>It will be <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> before I write again. Accept, my dear Mother, the kind wishes of my heart, that the year now arriving may be happy for yourself and all that both of us love! and that when our allotted span of years is done, we may meet in that far and bright Country, where sorrow and sighing shall flee away!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

My Mother has been beside me this whole day, and to sit down to deceive her before her very face required more audacity than I possess. Even now she is gone for a few minutes only, and should she return and ask me who I am writing to! Oh M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle how I am plagued with you! Why will you not let me live at home in peace? By what right do you extort from me promises which after sober reflection I find it as painful as imprudent and difficult to fulfil, which I cannot break without failing in my word, which I cannot keep without failing in my duty?</p>
<p>You say there is no harm in our correspondence and I believe it: But assuredly there is harm in disobedience and deceit, the only means through which it can at present be maintained. And is it for you who profess to be my friend to teach me these? Is it for you who talk of generosity so well to require of me the sacrifice of my own esteem to your selfish gratification? What have you done for me to merit such a sacrifice? What proofs of regard have you given me, greater than I can command from every fool who comes in my way? My friend, before you draw so largely on my gratitude do something for my sake. Render your friendship as honourable in the eyes of the world to my Father&#x2019;s child<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She is not merely Jane Welsh but the child of a father highly respected in Haddington.</note> as it is already honourable in her own eyes to Jane Welsh and then you may <hi rend="italic">exact</hi> as <hi rend="italic">your due</hi> favours you have as yet no <hi rend="italic">claim</hi> to <hi rend="italic">ask</hi>. Oh M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle if you wish me to admire&#x2014;to love you (admiration and love is with me the same feeling) use as you ought your precious time, and the noble powers that god has given you, and waste no hours or thoughts on <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014; And do not laugh at fame&#x2014; It is indeed a name&#x2014;perhaps an empty name&#x2014;but yet it is the object of no low ambition, and ambition is the crime of no low soul&#x2014;</p>
<p>I will not write again&#x2014; Do not urge me least you wear out my patience and with it my
esteem. You may think it unlikely that should ever happen&#x2014;as you have sometimes found me weak and thoughtless <pb id="pg-01-421" n="01:421"/>you may expect to find me always so&#x2014; But there are moments when the weak are strong, and when the thoughtless think, and such moments are more frequent with me than you suppose.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Whilst preparing to send off the manuscript, which you receive herewith, I was favoured with your packet, this morning. Upon glancing at the paper of Mr Mohr, I think it will not be very difficult to have at least the half of it done before the <date when="1820-05-00">end of May</date>. If along with the proof sheet of Hansteen, you could inclose a frank for the paper on crystallography, I shall immediately return the former and what part of the latter I have finished, at that date&#x2014;which you will not fail to make the latest possible.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is sending the manuscript of his review &#x201C;Remarks upon Professor Hansteen&#x2019;s Inquiries Concerning the Magnetism of the Earth,&#x201D; which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</hi>, III (<date when="1820-07-00">July 1820</date>), 124&#x2013;38; IV (<date when="1821-01-00">Jan. 1821</date>), 114&#x2013;24. He also refers to his translation &#x201C;Outlines of Professor Mohs&#x2019;s New System of Crystallography and Mineralogy,&#x201D; published in the same journal, III (<date when="1820-07-00">July 1820</date>), 154&#x2013;76; III (<date when="1820-10-00">Oct. 1820</date>), 317&#x2013;42; IV (<date when="1821-01-00">Jan. 1821</date>), 56&#x2013;57.

<p>I am sorry that the remarks on Hansteen are so very insignificant as I fear you will reckon them. My attention has been dissipated and distracted by a thousand objects. I would have transcribed the paper a third time&#x2014;for it looks very ill in its present mangled dress&#x2014;but for the fear of being too late.&#x2014; I hope to make the next more interesting.</p>
<p>I have yet taken no steps in the affair of <hi rend="italic">Prussia</hi>. The gentleman you mention is certainly by far the properest person for such an article and I have abundance of work besides.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brewster&#x2019;s letter to Carlyle suggesting that he write on a subject relating to Prussia has not been found. &#x201C;The gentleman you mention&#x201D; is unidentified.

<ps><p>I will thank you to bid the servant put that note into the penny-post-office as soon as convenient. It relates to my books, which the carrier, gone home yesterday, is in danger of forgetting a <hi rend="italic">second time</hi>, to bring me.</p></ps>

<p>Archenholz (History of the Seven Years War) <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des Siebenj&#xE4;hrigen Krieges;</hi> a plain perspicuous and rather interesting history, and very easy to read. Price about 12/.</p>
