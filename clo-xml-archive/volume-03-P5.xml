<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>As I liked your letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> very much, I am determined not to let it long want an answer; and being at liberty this night I purpose to enjoy myself a little by chatting with you. Letters out of the bottom of Strath Tay<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Valley of the Tay River.</note> in the depth of winter cannot well be expected to be entertaining: unless the writer have the country&#x2019;s gift, that of second sight, he can have few interesting objects to describe; and the surrounding monotony of the vegetable, the animal and mineral kingdoms, the stagnant dulness of all things earthly and celestial, is too apt to extend its narcotic influence even to the mind, and to paralyze the power of thought as other powers are paralyzed. In my case, at least, aided as it is by my peculiar circumstances, things are even so: I have thought none since I saw you, and scarcely expect to think any till I see you again. I am of the hybernating animals; torpid like the swallow and the bat: my intellect is defunct for a time; <foreign><hi rend="italic">elle reparoitra au printemps</hi></foreign> [it will reappear come spring]. But intellect is not all that we want, or indispensable to <hi rend="italic">our</hi> intercourse. We are Brothers, Jack; and it is pleasant and proper to write, whether we have any thing to say or not.</p>
<p>I rejoice to find that you are going on so handsomely at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; so busy, so profitably busy, and enjoying so fair a modicum of health and contentment. There is nothing more noble in this world than the sincere pursuit of knowledge; nothing more interesting than to see a young man striving with all his energies towards such an object, and controuling his desires for pleasure and his dissatisfaction under painful restraint, consenting to be unhappy for the present that he may be happy and honoured in the future. I am glad to learn that your repugnance to Medicine is gradually wearing away: persist honestly in the study, and you will like it more and more. Like all practical sciences medicine is begirt with a tangled border of minute, technical, uninteresting or it may be disgusting details; the whole of which must be mastered before you penetrate into the philosophy of the business, and get the better powers of your understanding at all fastened on the subject. You are now I suppose getting across these brambly thickets into the green fields of the science. Go on and prosper <pb id="pg-03-4" n="03:4"/>my dear Jack! Let not the difficulties repulse you, nor the little contentions of natural taste abate your ardour. To conquer our inclinations of whatever sort is a lesson which all men have to learn; and the man who learns it soonest will learn it easiest. This Medicine your judgement says is to be useful to you: do you assail it and get the better of it, in spite of all other considerations. It is a noble thing to have a profession by the end: it makes a man independent of all mortals; he is richer than a lord, for no <hi rend="italic">external</hi> change can destroy the possession which he has acquired for himself. Nor is there any weight in the fears you labour under about failing in more interesting acquisitions by your diligence in following after this. It appears to me that a man who is not born to some independency, if he means to devote himself to literature properly so called, even <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to study some profession which as a first preliminary will enable him to live. It is galling and heartbreaking to live on the precarious windfalls of literature: and the idea that one has not <hi rend="italic">time</hi> for practicing an honest calling is stark delusion. I could have studied three professions in the time I have been forced (for want of one) to spend in strenuous idleness;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230819-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1823-08-19">19 Aug. 1823</date></ref>.</note> I could practice the most laborious doctors occupation at this moment in less time than I am constrained to devote to toiling in that which cannot permanently profit, and serves only to make a scanty &#x201C;provision for the day that is passing over me.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quoted from Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s Preface to the <hi rend="italic">English Dictionary</hi>. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230728-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-07-28">28 July 1823</date></ref>.</note> But I will preach no more; for you are a reasonable youth, Jack, and are already bent on persevering. I only wish to see you moderately diligent to be assured that you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> fail. There is nothing to hinder you from becoming one of the medical Lights of your age, and adorning all your medical ideas and your every-day proceedings in the world with those more elegant and catholic accomplishments, a deep skill in philosophy and literature, which scarcely any physician of our day is possessed of. I know you will always be an honourable downright kind-hearted fellow, and I shall yet live to see you a man of mark among the Thinkers and Doers of your time.</p>
<p>You do well to stick by Good;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18231216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1823-12-16">16 Dec. 1823</date></ref>.</note> in my poor opinion, he looked like a more rational person than most of your instructors. I also commend your employment of the evening in lighter studies or even recreations. It is needless to be too critcal in what you read; you know the English <pb id="pg-03-5" n="03:5"/>classics by name: read them in any order you can get them in. Have you read Campbell&#x2019;s Philosophy of Rhetoric?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Written by George Campbell (<date when="1719">1719</date>&#x2013;<date when="1796">96</date>) and published in <date when="1776">1776</date>.</note> Kames&#x2019; Elements of Criticism,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Written by Henry Home, Lord Kames (<date when="1696">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1782">1782</date>), and published in <date when="1762">1762</date>.</note> which you once began? Have you read Boswell&#x2019;s Life of Johnson and Boswell&#x2019;s Tour to the Hebrides? Read them both, if you have not; for the picture they give you of a very strange and rather great man is at once graphic interesting and amusing. Have you read Alison on Taste?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Archibald Alison (<date when="1757">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839">1839</date>), minister of the Episcopal Chapel, Cowgate, Edinburgh, from <date when="1800">1800</date> until his death, author of <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Nature and Principles of Taste</hi> (<date when="1780">1780</date>).</note> But on the whole these critical geniuses (except Kames and perhaps Campbell) are not just the very best thing you can read at this time: I mean that you should rather be trying to gather ideas than be too earnest about the way of dressing them. When the thoughts are there the words will soon follow. As to your essay-writing I grant it is irksome, tho&#x2019; some sort of writing is very essential for acquiring a style. I wrote nothing but <hi rend="italic">letters</hi>: however I still feel the effects of that preponderance of taste over capability; I will write very slow. After all it is the logic of the thing, the arrangement of the thoughts, their vividness and number which regulate speed in writing. Never envy Rate:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle speaks of Eneas Rate, one of his companions, as a mediocre but highly ambitious poet in a letter to his brother Alexander of <date when="1824-01-07">7 Jan</date>.</note> it is better to write two sentences a-day as they sho<supplied>[uld]</supplied> be written, tha<supplied>[n many]</supplied> sheets of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">joot</hi></foreign> [sour liquor] which his headpiece ferments and pours forth so copiously. I would however recommend you certainly to <hi rend="italic">try something</hi>: if you cannot in winter we shall have it in spring when I come near you&#x2014;which will be sooner than you look for.</p>
<p>In fact you must know, Sir, that <hi rend="italic">one</hi> month is going to satisfy me here: the people, particularly the Lady, seem still more tired of the place than I am; they are going down to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> about the first of Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi> to stay there for a month&#x2014;meaning to return again, and then set out for London in April. I do not return. Meister must begin printing whenever I arrive, and I must push it thro&#x2019; as fast as possible. Woe to this Schiller! I have absolutely taken up a horror at it. Would you believe that I but began it <hi rend="italic">three nights ago</hi>, and am not yet half thro&#x2019; the first copy of it. My mind absolutely will not fasten on it, <foreign><hi rend="italic">ne veut pas mordre</hi></foreign> [will not bite]: besides, the mercury has made me weaker than a sparrow both in body and mind. Nothing but a stout heart to a steep <foreign>brae</foreign> [steep hill]! I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be thro it, betide what may. As to the drugs, the less we say of them the better: I could not if you took me <pb id="pg-03-6" n="03:6"/>on oath this moment say whether they have done me good or harm; both certainly; but I rather think the good predominates. I am far weaker, but I sleep almost every night. The tobacco I am beginning to suspect is a real improvement: I have not yet decided; nor, of course touched a morsel of it. I shall get well when I am better settled, and the weather warmer.</p>
<p>The Bullers are all away to dance at a ball up the valley some miles at Castle Menzies: I should have said all but Arthur, whose boots being deranged he declined going. He and I dined and are to have tea together. I always go in at eight and drink <hi rend="italic">one</hi> cup with them, and talk <foreign><hi rend="italic">inepta</hi></foreign> for a while. On the whole I am more comfortable than I once was,&#x2014;which is something tho&#x2019; not much.</p>
<p>You did well to send the Targer<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Johnston.</note> a letter: did he come to see you? or write to you? Did Mitchell come and prosper? Tell me when you write. Is Duncan recovered? Is the Jurist<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;Jurisconsult,&#x201D; a nickname for George Dalgliesh.</note> come to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>? Write to the Child of Misfortune,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Waugh.</note> and make my compliments to him. Do you know what he has done with himself?&#x2014; I had a letter this day from home, written by the joint hands of our Father, Mother and Alick: they are all as they should be. What a miserable story is this of Basie&#x2019;s! Poor Mrs Bell! she sat beside me last time I was in the meeting-house at Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x2014;and now&#x2014;!&#x2014; Basil Sandy says is fled.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The joint letter from Carlyle&#x2019;s father, mother, and brother is dated <date when="1823-12-28">28 Dec. 1823</date>. Norton prints portions of the letter from the father and mother in <hi rend="italic">EL</hi>, pp. 300&#x2013;301. Passages from Alick&#x2019;s letter follow:<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;Your private idea of the <hi rend="italic">fatal and fruitless</hi> passion of my old coach companion poor little Fyffe, towards a nameless Damsel; is I can assure you perfectly in unison with my own. Scarcely had we passed only a few minits togither when this very idea struck me, (tho&#x2019; I knew nothing of his history;) and his interrogations and continual talking about &#x2018;Miss Jane Welsh&#x2019; served powerfully to confirm it. I had moreover shrewdness enough to gather that he regarded you as his deadli<supplied>[e]</supplied>st rival, but with what propriety I could not say. &#x2026; we are all of us tired of living on this <hi rend="italic">wild hill</hi>&#x2014;our Father as much as any of us. And in the next place where shall we go to be better or rather have we within ourselv<supplied>[e]</supplied>s the means of going, that is to say of taking a larger and far better farm, the answer is short &#x26; would to a vain man be painful to utter. We have not! &#x2026; Did you notice in the paper what horrible work has been carrying on among the dead here. The ringleader of those villa<supplied>[i]</supplied>ns is one Bazel or Basie Forsyth an ugly thief <hi rend="italic">hash</hi> this day as ever the blessed Sun rose upon. He is fled.&#x201D;<lb/><lb/>
The point of Alick&#x2019;s remarks is that Basil Forsyth was evidently one of a gang of body-snatchers disinterring corpses for use in anatomy schools, and that Mrs. Bell was a victim. The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1823-12-17">17 Dec. 1823</date>, reprints a report from the <hi rend="italic">Kelso Mail</hi> that &#x201C;a party of Resurrection men, as they are called, furnished with the necessary apparatus for raising dead bodies, is at present traversing the country.<lb/><lb/>
&#x2026; In the neighbourhood of Carlisle &#x2026; the disinterment of the dead has lately been carried on by them on an extensive scale; and &#x2026; the &#x2018;hue and cry&#x2019; was raised, which caused the miscreants to decamp. &#x2026; It is believed that the men &#x2026; took the road towards Hawick.&#x201D;</note> But <foreign><hi rend="italic">Basta</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-03-7" n="03:7"/>[Enough]! Many, many happy new years to you Jack! Were you able to sleep last night?

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I came down to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, about six week ago partly, that I might consult you <supplied>[about]</supplied> the printing of this <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>; I found you absent, and got but a lame account of the matter from your representatives; to-day I have heard that you were returned, and I address you again on the subject.</p>
<p>I am to be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> about the last day of this month; after which I am to have <hi rend="italic">two months&#x2019; leave of absence</hi> for the purpose of accomplishing my engagement with you. That done I go to London and Cornwall and France and the Lord knows whither. Thus you see how it stands: On the very first day of February I shall be ready to begin (having already near a volume before hand); and the whole undertaking must be finished before the <date when="1824-04-01">first of April</date>. I hope it will be easily in your power to manage all this. The arrangements about paper and type and so forth I leave entirely in your own hands; believing that they will be well attended to, and that Goethe in his English coat may not disgrace the furnishers.</p>
<p>As I went farther into the work I conceived better hopes of its success. Blackwood in a criticism of some work two months ago said: &#x201C;We are glad to see Messrs Oliver and Boyd announce a forthcoming translation of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>. This is beginning at the right place&#x201D;&#x2014;or words to that effect, the reading of which (much as I despise Blackwood) rather did me good.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle probably refers to a passage in a review of <hi rend="italic">Popular Tales of Northern Nations</hi> (London, <date when="1823">1823</date>) in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> for <date when="1823-09">Sept. 1823</date>, which reads: &#x201C;We are happy to see Messrs Oliver and Boyd announce a forthcoming version of Go&#xEB;the&#x2019;s Wilhelm Meister; this is the true plan. Don&#x2019;t give us any of the minors until the really great authors are exhausted. A good translation of Go&#xEB;the&#x2019;s &#x2018;Life of Himself&#x2019; would be an excellent speculation. To say nothing of the great poet himself, the light it affords of common German life of all kinds would render that book a most acceptable present to the English public.&#x201D;</note> We shall furnish Goethe with a preface; put him <pb id="pg-03-8" n="03:8"/>into standard English;&#x2014;in clear sharp types and good paper; and then send him forth to seek his fortune, fearlessly as others do.</p>
<p>I shall be glad to hear from you on this subject, if you have any alteration to propose. If I hear nothing, I shall consider it as settled in this manner.</p>

<p><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Ma bien-aim&#xE9;e</hi></foreign> [My well-beloved]!</salute> I write to you in the greatest haste, rather than miss writing altogether. Owing to some infatuation, which I hardly pretend to account for, much less to excuse, I absolutely <hi rend="italic">could not</hi> fix myself to any vigorous exertion of thought till within the last three days. I did nothing but read useless books, and dream, and gossip with Mrs B<supplied>[uller]</supplied> about the literary men of the age, or with her husband about &#x201C;Hume&#x2019;s philosophy,&#x201D; and Jeremy Bentham, and &#x201C;the force of public opinion.&#x201D; Now <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> is to be called for in a fortnight; and I am just about to burn the only three pages of it that are yet written. Judge then if I am hurried!</p>
<p>Who would have thought that you possessed such a melancholy gift of imagining? I conceived that I myself had been the only adept in that profitable science: but I now find that you are not a whit inferior. Lost my affection? O Jane! that you were equally secure against all other losses! My affection for you is not grounded on vague and transient delusions, but on congruity of disposition, on respect for your qualities, and tender concern for your fate: it is calm and steadfast; and will not change, till you are tired of it, or I am become a very miserable creature. At all events we <hi rend="italic">will not</hi> part so long as we can help it. I will correspond with you to the end&#x2014;if your future Sovereign will permit so pleasant an arrangement; and if he will not, he must be a churl undeserving the happiness of such a wife. As for the aimiable Mrs C. that shall be, it is not likely that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> will disturb us for several years yet.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-9" n="03:9"/>I need not say that I rejoice to hear of the new facilities for study, and the general accession of comfort you have lately acquired. Are you still well? For God&#x2019;s sake take care of yourself: it is the most dreadful thing out of the Pit of darkness, the only thing that can completely ruin you and make you miserable, to lose your health. One great point is to keep as free as possible from all disquieting thoughts; a prescription indeed easy to give, but difficult effectually to follow. There is no mastering of these vexations by open combat; the best way in general is to avoid them, to give them the slip by diligence or dissipation of any kind. But the misfortune of people such as we are is that we can find no proper dissipation; the persons about us have other aims, other ideas; their conversation is not of the kind we seek; we reject it entirely, and chuse rather to dwell in the solitude of our own chagrin than in the midst of such inane tho&#x2019; comfortable follies. This I believe is altogether wrong; tho&#x2019; few can at first perceive it to be so. One <hi rend="italic">should</hi> have company&#x2014;communion and fellowship with our kind&#x2014;even if it were but with the drivellers of the earth. My dearest Jane! if you would avoid being wretched, never estrange yourself from the beaten ways of men: mix in their concerns, participate in their interests, imitate their common habits, however poor and mean. No one knows more bitterly than I the consequence of neglecting this. Observe it, be diligent, cherish honest thoughts, and with health and competence you will be happy. Burton&#x2019;s precept in his Anatomy of Melancholy is, &#x201C;Be not solitary, be not idle&#x201D;; with my whole strength I repeat to you, &#x201C;Be not solitary, be not idle.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Burton (<date when="1577">1577</date>&#x2013;<date when="1640">1640</date>), <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy</hi>, Pt. III, sec. iv, mem. ii, subs. vi.</note></p>
<p>You speak of the decay of ambition. I do truly believe that you never will be perfect as you should be till your ambition is considerably lessened. Fame is a pleasant thing to get, as all men, indeed all living creatures know: but I am persuaded that the love of it was never yet and never can be the moving principle of any genuinely great action. This appears to me as certain as the fact of our existence. If I thought you were impelled towards literature by no higher principle, I should feel very sorry: and as it is, I look forward with great hope of benefit to the mitigating influence of years, the flight of which is sure to diminish this feeling in you. For myself I declare I often feel that one hour of deep, deep <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> were worth all the glory in the universe.</p>
<p>This, you observe, is nothing but the old song; and you do not <pb id="pg-03-10" n="03:10"/>value it a jot. I confess I do not love you less for your unbelief; tho&#x2019; for the sake of your own happiness and true dignity I wish very much I could convince you. I would prove that literary fame, even when it can be gained in all its fulness, is by no means the most enviable thing for man or woman; that life has other far more solid, and I hesitate not to say, more noble enjoyments and attainments; that <supplied>[it]</supplied> forms a beautiful enhancement to these more general blessings, but that without them it is <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than nothing. Will you not believe this? I pray God that a more mild experience than usual may teach it you. But let me not weary you with sermons; you have enough for once. You know in your heart that it is a trembling anxiety for your happiness that prompts me, therefore you will not take it ill. I often wish I could live three calendar months beside you: it seems to me I could correct much much in your philosophy of life, that I greatly fear may yet work you pain. One thing you should drive away from you: it is the excessive vehemence with which you regret your small proficiency and the flight of time. This is very natural, but erroneous. Life is not so short as that amounts to: I believe no literary man ever spent the <hi rend="italic">fiftieth part</hi> of his time or attention upon literature. Cowper was near his grand climacteric<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle comments, &#x201C;Climacterics are supposed critical stages in the life of man. They occur in multiples of seven. &#x2026; Sixty-three is called &#x2018;the grand climacteric.&#x2019;&#x201D; But Carlyle evidently thought that it was forty-nine, since he must have known that though Cowper did not begin writing until he was fifty, he wrote much of his best work before he reached sixty-three.</note> before he began to write at all. Think what forty years of diligence will do, if you employ them well! I swear to you there is no danger: you want only a little experience to give you confidence in your own powers. You live at present shut out, absolutely shut out, from all communication with minds like your own: this is the greatest evil in your lot; it is this which I hope your journey to London will do much to remedy. You see the world as it were thro&#x2019; a telescope: no wonder that you know not how to touch it, or produce effect on it. All this, however, Time will remedy. <hi rend="italic">Exercise your own judgement</hi>, consider, calculate calmly and solemnly what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> best to be done in every emergency; do it steadfastly; I predict unflinchingly that Jane Welsh will yet be an honour to her sex and country. Only be patient and firm; and there is no danger. Be kind, obliging, good-natured to all about you, and diligent at your tasks, and never fear.</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I meant to have written sooner, but put it off till I should have more leisure, or something more interesting to communicate; and, as often happens in such cases, I am at last obliged to write when more hurried than ever, and considerably duller than I have been for a week. My silence I hope has given you no uneasiness; it ought not, if you kept in mind the maxim which I gave you some time ago, always to believe me well unless you heard the contrary. In fact there is or has been very little change in my health; I am better and worse just about as I used to be. I cannot say that I relish their mercury; and for the tobacco, which I have not touched for six weeks, there seems to be no great benefit attending this sort of abstinence.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Bell&#x2019;s diagnosis of Carlyle&#x2019;s disorder had indicated a need for mercury and abstinence from tobacco. &#x201C;Can you give it up?&#x201D; asked Bell. &#x201C;Give it up, sir?&#x201D; replied Carlyle, &#x201C;I can cut off my left hand with an axe, if <hi rend="italic">that</hi> should be necessary.&#x201D; See David Masson, <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Sketches and Memories</hi> (London and Edinburgh, <date when="1892">1892</date>), p. 320.</note> On the whole, however, <pb id="pg-03-12" n="03:12"/>one way or another I think I have slept somewhat better and been less wretched for the last month than formerly. <hi rend="italic">Here</hi> it is quite impossible that I should ever recover; but with better arrangements, I still have hopes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Time and hours wear out the roughest day&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, I, iii.</note> this dreary period of pain and idleness and depression and discomfort is now near a close. The old people go down to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> this day week, and we younger ones follow, in about ten days. I am not to revisit Kinnaird. The printing of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> commences immediately on my arrival, and is to be concluded in about two months. About three fourths of it are yet to translate; for the writing of this weary <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> has occupied me to the exclusion of every thing beside. Nor is it finished yet! The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> and last Part is not above half done, tho&#x2019; it will be wanted in a few days. Till within the last week, I could not for my heart begin it handsomely and honestly. The mercury had made me weak as any sparrow; and besides I was very idly-inclined. So I am now obliged to write like a Turk, and vex myself day and night that the thing is not done faster and better. It certainly satisfies me very little.</p> 
<p>Yet the writing of it has done me good. It has yielded myself along with all the trouble considerable pleasure: it is also an improving task, and brings in money. The amount of the whole will be about sixty guineas. Oh! if I were well, I could soon make <supplied>[myself]</supplied> rich and bid defiance to fortune. The publication of this very mean performance has further raised me considerably in the estimation of these worthy people. About ten days ago the Introduction to Part II. which you have never seen, appeared quoted in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1824-01-01">1 Jan.</date></note> an honour, very slender in itself, but sufficient to astonish the natives in this Gothic district. They begin to look upon me as a youth of parts superior to what they had suspected. The glory of being approved by &#x201C;Bloody old Walter&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Walter (<date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847">1847</date>) became general manager and supervisor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> in <date when="1803">1803</date>.</note> as Cobbett calls the Editor of the Times is no doubt very very small: yet his approval was, so far as I can recollect, almost the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> testimony to merit on my part which <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not be warped by partiality, my very name and existence being totally unknown to &#x201C;Bloody Old.&#x201D; Therefore I read it with pleasure: it made me happy for ten minutes; cheerful for a whole afternoon: even yet I sometimes think of it. If I told all this to any other, I might justly be accused of weak and immeasurable vanity: but to you, I know it will give pleasure, as every pleasant <pb id="pg-03-13" n="03:13"/>thing that happens to me does. Jack and you are the only two to whom I should think of mentioning it. Let us not despise the day of small things!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Zech. 4:10.</note> Better times are coming.</p>
<p>Have they sent you Irving Orations?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">For the Oracles of God, Four Orations. For Judgment to come, an argument, in nine parts</hi> (London, <date when="1823">1823</date>).</note> And how are they relished at Mainhill? I still think it was a very considerable pity that he had published them. It is not with books as with other things: <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> is nothing, <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> is all in all. There is stuff in that book of Irvings to have made a first-rate work of the kind out of. But it is not dressed, it is not polished. We have not the <hi rend="italic">bottle</hi> of heart-piercing &#x201C;Mountain-dew,&#x201D; but the <hi rend="italic">tub</hi> of uncleanly <hi rend="italic">mash</hi>, or at best of ill-fermented ale, yeasty, muddy, full of hops and sediment, so that no man can drink of it with comfort. There is a sturdy lashing of it in the last Quarterly Review (which makes me notice it), apparently by the pen of Southey.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Rev. Mr Irving&#x2019;s Orations&#x201D; appeared not in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> but in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi>, XIV (<date when="1823-08">Aug. 1823</date>), 145&#x2013;62, and was, in fact, by J. G. Lockhart. The review speaks of Irving as &#x201C;dauntlessly and desparately arrogant&#x201D; and &#x201C;one of the most absurdly self-conceited persons of our time.&#x201D; It asks, &#x201C;Has he shown himself to be a great man?&#x2014;a great orator?&#x2014;a great reasoner?&#x2014;a masterly and original mind?&#x2014;a master of English eloquence?&#x2014; No such things. He is neither more nor less than a clever copier of Dr. Chalmers of Glasgow.&#x201D; Southey later wrote of Irving as &#x201C;a man of great, but peculiar, powers&#x201D; and possessed of a &#x201C;soul <supplied>[which]</supplied> burned with the love of whatsoever things are pure, and great, and lovely, and of good report&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, XII [<date when="1838-02">Feb. 1838</date>], 143).</note> It will be well for Irving to attend to these advices of Southey&#x2019;s; for tho&#x2019; excessively severe they are all to a certain extent grounded upon truth. Tell me about these &#x201C;Arguments,&#x201D; and Cobbett &#x26;c &#x26;c, when you next write.</p>
<p>As to this project of the farm, which we were speaking of, I of course cannot more than you say any thing definite. I do not think my proper place is in the country but in London or amid some great collection of men. Did my state of health permit I think I should go Southward without delay. But unfortunately <hi rend="italic">that</hi> in the present state of matters cannot once be thought of; and a year&#x2019;s residence in the country would if convenient be by far the most profitable speculation I could think of. Nor, for your part of it, am I surprised that you are wearied of Mainhill: it is a place of horrid drudgery and must always be so. Surely our father and you by laying heads together might manage to find out a better. And as to the want of money, I do not think it should be made an obstacle. I have at this time between 3 and <pb id="pg-03-14" n="03:14"/>4 hundred pounds, for which I have not the smallest use; and certainly independently of all regard to you I should like better to see the whole or any part of that sum invested in a good farm under your superintendance than lying dormant in the bank. Of this I positively assure you. Except for the education of Jack this money is of no avail to me: to see it serving any Brother that I have is by far the most profitable use I can put it to. I would therefore wish that you would still keep this scheme in your eye; and be ready to give me some more precise account of it against my home-coming. The Bullers are to stay about three weeks in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> after which I partly purpose to come down to Mainhill, and print the Book in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;correcting the press by aid of the post. If not comfortably lodged in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I surely shall. I wish I were there even now, riding upon the outside of Dolph, getting back my health and fearing nothing! I am glad to hear that the poor beast is getting up its heart again. Take it forth sometimes and give it a sharp race, observing to keep it at the &#x201C;high trot.&#x201D; I learned the use of this pace while here: it trains the horse to lift up its feet freely and avoid stumbling. You should also make him carry my mother down to sermon on the sabbath-days. If postage were free I would surely answer at very great length the estimable epistles that accompanied your last. Tell my Father that when I get to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I will shew him that I have &#x201C;read&#x201D; his letter.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1823-12-28">28 Dec.</date>, Carlyle&#x2019;s father had made a humorous reference to the remark of a neighbor, who, after being unable to read what he himself had written, had said, &#x201C;Let it go; they can read anything in Edinburgh.&#x201D; Norton, <hi rend="italic">EL</hi>, p. 300n.</note> As for my Mother, she <hi rend="italic">must write more frequently</hi>: there is nothing to hinder her from writing a sheet full whenever she pleases. No piece of penmanship that I have seen for many a day touched me as hers did: I will write to her <hi rend="italic">next</hi> time, that is whenever I get to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;about a fortnight hence or rather more. Do you mind to write <hi rend="italic">within</hi> that period; my answer will not be long in following. Commend me to the love of all my loved kinsmen and kinswomen&#x2014;I think of them <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, but have not room for names. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my dear boy!</p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I suppose you calculated on not being troubled with any more of my scribbling till after you had seen me face to face on the first of February: but according to the Scotch adage, <hi rend="italic">he wad need to have a lang ladle that sups <foreign>kail</foreign> wi the de&#x2019;il</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> wad need to have a long head that predicts the movements of aught depending on Mrs B. We have altered our plans: I am not to come down till the <hi rend="italic">tenth</hi> of February, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> to be wholly my own master for three months. Boyd writes to me for the manuscript of Meister; which I accordingly have sent, having this opportunity of <hi rend="italic">Mast&#x2019; and Missu&#x2019;s</hi> journey to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> for which place they set out to-morrow morning early. Denovan the crack-brained Butler has undertaken to convey the parcel cost-free; and I am scribbling a few unmeaning lines to you to go along with it.</p>
<p>Of course I suppose you will understand to carry down this parcel of <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi> at your leisure to Boyds. I have told him to send me up the proof-sheets of Paul if he think it necessary, which I hardly do. However we should leave him no room for the echo of a grumble.</p>
<p>It is impossible to tell you how I have been whipt about of late; or how I look to be for some time coming. This accursed Schiller is not finished yet! I seldom get at it till six o&#x2019;clock; and in such a state as would astonish the soul of the bravest scribbler on Earth. Then I am called off at eight to get tea; and frequently I never have the heart to begin again. Oh heaven and Earth! it is enough to drive me utterly <pb id="pg-03-16" n="03:16"/>mad&#x2014;that I must waste my precious, precious, unreturning time, and wear out my weary days in torment for mere daily bread! Some of this Schiller I have written about <hi rend="italic">ten times over</hi>, and still it is very <hi rend="italic">very</hi> bad. To-day they were out roe-hunting, and I wrote about as much as I had done in a week before. Patience! Patience! or rather Fortitude! and Action! for patience will not do.</p>
<p>I have little hope of getting a quiet lodging in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; I shall get little sleep I fear; and without sleep the result is easy to predict. I have a notion of going fairly down to Mainhill, and having the proof-sheets sent me by post. I shall see when I arrive&#x2014;about the tenth.</p>
<p>It is impossible for any thing to be more stagnant and monotonous than our life here is. We are all very agreeable together but there is no new topic among us; and now grouse-shooting having failed, the good people are getting weary of their abode here. Two or three squires of the neighbourhood have looked in upon us of late; but their minds are what Pump Sandy calls a <foreign><hi rend="italic">vaaccum: naiter and airt</hi></foreign> [nature and art] <hi rend="italic">working together</hi> have rendered them very dull. We had the other night a Sir John (Something, I forget what, perhaps, Ogilvie)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Sir John Ogilvie (<date when="1803">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890">90</date>), ninth Baronet.</note> &#x201C;one of the numerous baronets of the age&#x201D; as Arthur with a violent effort at contempt described him; a person not unlike John Wright, <foreign>Cutty</foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Cutty</hi> in Scots means short, a suitable epithet for a tailor.</note> Wright, the tailor, but of course much politer. There was also one Abercromby Dick,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Major-General Sir Robert Dick (<date when="1786">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846">1846</date>; ODNB), veteran of Napoleonic wars, retired to Tullymet, <date when="1825">1825</date>. <corr>The editors identify &#x201C;Abercromby&#x201D; as unknown at <hi rend="italic">CL</hi> 3:16, but Rory Beaton points out in a comment to the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi> Feedback Page submitted on <date when="2009-08-08">8 Aug. 2009</date> that Abercromby Dick (b. <date when="1792">1792</date>) was the younger brother of Sir Robert.</corr></note> who invited me over to Tullymet his place of abode: I have some thought of going, if once I were at leisure. Thurtell being hanged last week,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Thurtell (b. <date when="1794">1794</date>), of Hertford, a manufacturer, received in <date when="1823">1823</date> &#xa3;2000 for damages done to a warehouse which he and his brother owned. He spent his share gambling and lost heavily to one William Weaver, a solicitor. Thurtell accused Weaver of cheating him, but for a time the two appeared to be reconciled. On Friday, <date when="1823-10-24">24 Oct. 1823</date>, while the men were on a hunting trip, Thurtell shot Weaver and then when Weaver tried to escape stunned him with his pistol butt and cut his throat. Thurtell was tried on <date when="1824-01-06">6</date> and <date when="1824-01-07">7 Jan. 1824</date> and hanged on <date when="1824-01-09">9 Jan</date>. Two accessories to the crime, Hunt and Probert, turned King&#x2019;s evidence and were reprieved. The crime, usually referred to as the Gill&#x2019;s Hill tragedy, was the subject of many books and articles at the time. Thurtell owned a gig, and one witness at his trial attested to the fact as a sign and token of his respectability. The incident prompted Carlyle to coin the word <hi rend="italic">gigmanity</hi>, to suggest the quality of one whose respectability is measured only by his possession of such a conveyance. As time went on <hi rend="italic">Gigman</hi> was more and more substituted for <hi rend="italic">Philistine</hi> in his writings. See also &#x201C;Jean Paul Friedrich Richter,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 130.</note> we grew duller than ever; till yesterday Mrs B turned off all her servants except two at one fell swoop. This keeps up our hearts for a time.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-17" n="03:17"/>On the whole, however, I have been happier than I usually was throughout the summer and autumn. My health I think is little worse or better than it was; but I have the prospect of speedy deliverance; and my mind has been full, disagreeably so, oftentimes, of this miserable Schiller. It will be done now ere another week: I write like desperation when they are gone.</p>
<p>Now Jack by way of answer to this hurried sketch I request that thou wilt send me a letter without loss of time. I expect to be with you about Saturday-fortnight, which I have just calculated to be the 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of the month. Tell me in the mean time all that you are doing or hoping to do: I long to hear from you. How far is Good<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John was reading John Mason Good&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Study of Medicine</hi> (London, <date when="1822">1822</date>).

What other thing do you read, or how do you go on &#x201C;in a general view&#x201D;? Write any thing thou pleasest, good Jack: thy fortunes great and small are all in some respects likewise fortunes of mine; therefore let me not be ignorant of them.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Having an opportunity of free conveyance (which I expected to occur earlier) I now send you all the <hi rend="italic">MS.</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> that is ready except a few sheets. These I have retained to enable you to judge better of the extent of the whole: you have here <hi rend="italic">precisely one third part of the book</hi>, so that you can easily calculate its size and make arrangements accordingly. I hope you will exert all your sagacity, for it would be a sorry thing to see the poor book come out in a form unworthy of it. If you have any proof-sheet to send me, I shall be here till the <hi rend="italic">tenth</hi> of February; for the people have altered their arrangements and begged me to alter mine in such a way that I could not refuse. After that date, however, I am positively and entirely at your service.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-19" n="03:19"/>As to the proof-sheets of <hi rend="italic">Paul</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paul et Virginie</hi> (<date when="1788">1788</date>), by Saint-Pierre, which Carlyle&#x2019;s brother John had translated and which Oliver &#x26; Boyd published without the translator&#x2019;s name in <date when="1824">1824</date>. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230509-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1823-05-09">9 May 1823</date></ref>.</note> there is nothing to hinder you from sending them to me, regularly by the post. Fold them as a letter, and mark &#x201C;single proof-sheet&#x201D; on the back. The Edition of <hi rend="italic">Paul</hi> can scarcely fail to succeed: if it do, the fault will lie elsewhere than on the translation; I have little hesitation in calling it, by far the best yet before the public.</p>
<p>On the <hi rend="italic">tenth</hi> I see you, when all these matters may be discussed far more at leisure. In the mean time (in extreme haste) I remain,</p>
<closer><salute>Dear Sir, / faithfully Your&#x2019;s /</salute></closer>
<name>Th: Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>I had forgot to mention that Mr Buller wants no more Numbers of Blackwoods Magazine: if you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> send the next, send it; but no more.</p>
<p>If you have several proofsheets to send at a time, they might come by some of the carriers; of whom one or two communicate with this place and Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> weekly&#x2014;</p>
<p>Above all things I feel anxious to have <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> printed before the end of March&#x2014;</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>I staid from church on Sunday, for the purpose of writing to you; rightly conjecturing that I should not have an hour to myself for some days to come. But after I had stir<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed the fire, and mended my pen, and set myself down to my desk, I discovered to my great disappointment that there was not a morsel of writing-paper in the house. What little things may spoil the finest projects!&#x2014; We came hither on Monday morning, and ever since I have been kept in a continual bustle&#x2014;</p>
<p>A change from pure air to smoke is to work miracles (they say) in reestablishing my health, and in the present state of affairs I have not thought it politic to dispute the matter&#x2014; So there is my new system of study thrown into confusion already! However I have brought a volume of Museas along with me; and am in great hope, that as I shall be permitted to decline all racketting about on the plea of my recent <pb id="pg-03-20" n="03:20"/>illness, the period of our sojourn here may not be altogether &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">sine linea</hi></foreign>&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Nulla dies sine linea</hi></foreign> (No day without a line), or in full: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nulla dies abeat quin linea ducta supersit</hi></foreign> (Let no day pass without some line being left behind it). Pliny associates this proverb with the great painter, Appelles&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note). See Pliny, <hi rend="italic">Historia Naturalis</hi>, XXXV, 36.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>If you come down at the time you purposed I shall most likely see you before I return to Haddington&#x2014;but it does not matter much tho&#x2019; you do not. We can converse with one another more &#x2018;soul to soul&#x2019; as we are, with the Forth betwixt us; than if we were stuck up together in my frigid Cousins<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Stodart&#x2019;s.</note> drawingroom.</p>
<p>On the whole I have been more diligent since the commencement of this new year. However I am not yet entirely quit of the bodily uneasiness, and restless listlessness of mind which has incapacitated me for any serious occupation for several months past. but as the causes of the secret disquietude which has been harrassing my thoughts and deeply undermining my health, are in a great measure removed, I expect in a short time to regain my usual ardour and activity&#x2014; My Mother continues to use me kindly and if fortune had not played me another malicious trick I should have enjoyed as perfect tranquillity for these last four weeks as my restless nature will admit of.</p>
<p>You must know I quarrelled with D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fyffe a day or two after you left us&#x2014; I had observed the workings of his little mind during your visit, with some feelings of contempt and displeasure, and his subsequent conduct completely ruined him in my esteem&#x2014; Only think the creature had the intolerable presumption to attempt to redicule you to my very face. He had heard me express high admiration for decision of mind, and proportionate contempt for the opposite quality. and so in the enviousness of his heart, he set about giving me a detail of your proceedings at the George Inn, which was meant to show you off as the most irresolute fickle minded Gentleman that ever fluctuated between half a dozen different opinions. Was there ever such daring impudence? however I kept my temper and heard him to an end with Job-like patience. When he thought proper to hold his tongue, satisfied (no doubt) that his masterly satire had entirely demolished your manly idea in my mind, I asked him, &#x201C;N<supplied>[ow]</supplied> Sir if <hi rend="italic">my Friend</hi>, knowing you to be possessed of my good opinion, had turned <hi rend="italic">his</hi> talent of satire (whic<supplied>[h]</supplied> I assure you does not come short of yours&#x2014;however much it may exceed it) to render you absurd and <pb id="pg-03-21" n="03:21"/>contemptible in my eyes, what would you have thought of him?<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> The Creature ruffled up like a Bantam about to fight&#x2014;and chattered with an astonishing command of absurdity&#x2014;about your impertinence in presuming to suppose him <hi rend="italic">drunk</hi> to which volley of nonsense I replied with a volley of <hi rend="italic">female</hi> eloquence which (I have a notion) is tingling in his ears up to this hour. I am pretty certain I have not spoken so long or so warmly since the day that you &#x26; I were in quest of Lady Warrender.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either widow of Sir Patrick Warrender (d. <date when="1799">1799</date>), <hi rend="italic">n&#xE9;e</hi> Blair (<date when="1759">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838">1838</date>), or Lady Anne, wife of Sir George Warrender (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">1849</date>), Sir Patrick&#x2019;s son. Sir Patrick was MP for Haddington burgh, <date when="1768">1768</date>&#x2013;<date when="1774">74</date>, and his son from <date when="1807">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1812">12</date>.</note> Mercy what a delicious walk that was! I have laughed at the recollection of it many a time&#x2014; But the M.D. had not the policy to give me the last word like you, and we parted mutually incensed and here I must part with him for the present tho all the important part of the story is to come. but my paper is almost filled and so illegibly that to cross it would drive you crazy altogether. I have devoted so much of it to these most uninteresting particulars because they have led <supplied>[to]</supplied> the most serious consequences&#x2014;consequences which might have involved the happiness of all my life to come&#x2014; I shall explain in my next&#x2014; I cannot make sense of what I have written<supplied>[&#x2014;]</supplied> consider this I am half dead of fatigue &#x26; headach<supplied>[e]</supplied>&#x2014;And that <hi rend="italic">five</hi> persons are conversing with me while I write&#x2014;but I must not put off till to morrow for I know not what it may bring forth; besides the fortnight is almost expir<supplied>[ed.]</supplied> God bless you for considering my comfort even at the cost of your own enjoyment I shall repay you hereafter<supplied>[.]</supplied> Address to me here&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dearest Jane,</salute>
<p>Last Friday I was once more gratified with the sight of your handwriting on the back of a letter for me; a sight which never fails, even in my most lugubrious humours, to dispel the dark shadows from my mind, and replace them with images of happiness and hope. I enjoyed your letter very much: you see I am anxious for another such. I confess I have no right to reply so soon; and to-night I ought to be minding other business: but you must let me play truant for once; I shall work better for it in time coming.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-22" n="03:22"/>Well! you are a dear, warm-hearted, fiery-tempered, faithful, affectionate creature: and tho&#x2019; you should not have done the Doctor so much honour as to get enraged at him, it was kind and like yourself to despise and disbelieve his little calumnies. At the same time, I will not insult our friendship by thanking you for this: it were indeed poor times with us if our esteem for one another lay at the mercy of every puny whipster that chose to take it on him to criticise us: you have done as I should do in a similar case. As for our satirical and medical friend, I cannot say that this little piece of magnanimity has perceptibly altered the place he held in my estimation. Considering his circumstances, it can excite little surprise and still less resentment. Small as the man&#x2019;s feelings may be, ridiculous as we may think his fancied injuries, to him they are not ridiculous: the least and weakest of living creatures is a universe for itself: the hopes and wishes of a grasshopper are to that grasshopper all in all. Let us be just to the Doctor: it was difficult to be generous, nor easy to be even candid, in his case; I forgive him for this time; and trust that when he next goes to the George inn to see me order a horse, and (finding it spavined and mounted with a coach-saddle) to counter-order it, I may have grace given me to go through that appalling operation in a more heroical manner.</p>
<p>For the rest, tho&#x2019; I regret that you should have taken the trouble to <hi rend="italic">quarrel</hi> with little Fyffe, I rather rejoice that your intimacy is concluded. Blind chance never in its most capricious mood brought two more uncongenial souls into contact than yours and his: friendship it was impossible that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> should ever feel for him; and what <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was presuming to feel the most careless might discover. I declare it did astonish me: the impudence of the human heart seemed to me to pass all calculation; I should as soon have thought of perching myself upon the horns of the moon.&#x2014; Pshaw! The body is going to make me also get sour at him, if I think any longer of this!</p>
<p>&#x2014;Doubt not that I wait with eager anxiety for the explanations you have promised me. It is a subject not without interest to either of us. I more than once meant to write of it or speak of it; but feelings you can easily conceive forbade me. How delightful it is that we have no secrets; but love each other, and trust each other, and are of one heart and mind even now! Do you think that it will continue? I sometimes think so. Many circumstances are against us; but <hi rend="italic">we ourselves</hi> are in our favour! Consider that, <foreign><hi rend="italic">mein Kind</hi></foreign>, and let us hope the best.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-23" n="03:23"/>You do not say how you get on with R&#xfc;bezahl the Carrot-counter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240812-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1824-08-12">12 Aug.</date></ref></note> or with your history and other studies. Of course this journey to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> must have interfered with you a little; yet you will still get something done; and on the whole a little moderate dissipation will do you good. For Heaven&#x2019;s sake how <hi rend="italic">is</hi> your health? On this point I have often tired you: let me again beg for my sake that you would be careful, solicitous in this matter. The loss of health is a thing quite possible with one of your temper and habits: it involves the loss of nearly all that life contains worth having. One thing I still must press upon you: it it [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to keep your mind as free as possible from vexatious thoughts. Above all, never let the slowness of your intellectual progress disturb you. Life is short, but not nearly so short as your fancy paints it: there is time in it for many long achievements, many changes of object, many failures both of our hopes and fears. <hi rend="italic">Festina lent&#xE9;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Make haste slowly,&#x201D; a literal translation into Latin from the Greek. Suetonius says that it represents one of the qualities of a good general and was often referred to as such by the Emperor Augustus, who had the motto in Greek stamped upon some of his coins, as Titus and Vespasian did later. Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi>, I, iii, <date when="1253">1253</date>; and Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Stetig Streben, ohne Hast&#x201D;</hi> (Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, p. 295).</note> is the motto: you make the greatest speed that way; if any thing can be attained, you attain it; if nothing, nature does not mean it; she has had fair play, and wherefore should we fret? That you write so slow and can still fix on nothing, I do not value a rush; in your circumstances, secluded and solitary as you have always been, it is of no account whatever. See! I am half a dozen years older than you; have done nothing else but study all my days, yet I write slow as a snail, a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> have no project before me more distinct than morning clouds. And do you think my dear that I have given up hopes of writing well, as well as ninetenths of &#x201C;the mob of gentlemen that write with ease&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221223-TC-DH-01">TC to DH, <date when="1822-12-23">23 Dec. 1822</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;far better than almost any of them, when in my vain key? By no manner of means, I assure you: my hopes are as good at this time as they ever were. Faith! and Patience! These are literary as well as religious virtues. Let us fear nothing.</p>
<p>You must not go away from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> till I come&#x2014;if you can possibly help it. There is no certainty in these people: they are gone to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> themselves, and have left me here to follow on the tenth, on Saturday week. Then I shall be down without fail. At present I am not very uncomfortable: the young men and I are quite alone: they are fine creatures and esteem me extremely in their way; and what is better, they leave me much time at my own disposal, and I am rather <pb id="pg-03-24" n="03:24"/>busy. Schiller will be done at last in about a week. God be thanked! for I am very sick of him. It is not in my right vein, tho&#x2019; nearer it than any thing I have yet done. In due time I shall find what I am seeking.&#x2014; When not writing, which health permits but at rare intervals, I go striding along these roads, or trotting the &#x201C;constitutional trot&#x201D;; thinking of many things&#x2014;often of Schiller; and ever and anon a little wicked gipsey, whose face I know too well is poking her nose into the concern&#x2014;doing her best to distract my attention. Devil take you! But I will be revenged on you for all this yet.</p>
<p>Now will you write to me, before I leave this place&#x2014;that is to say before ten days? I know you will. Also do try if possible to let me see you in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. I am never absent from you a week, till I begin longing again to see you; and we almost never meet without etiquette or some cursed business depriving us of nine tenths of the pleasure. It is very provoking: but I swear it shall not always be so! I will go with you to London by the first of May&#x2014;at least I hope and believe so. Write soon to me. God bless you my beloved Jane! Be good and love me. <closer><salute>Your&#x2019;s forever,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My own dear Brother</salute>
<p>I do not know in what mood I like most to have your letters&#x2014;whether in joy or in sorrow; for somehow they have the power both to deaden my sensibility to pain and to enliven it to pleasure. When I received your last I was in excellent glee, and after reading it I felt as if I could have jumped over the Moon&#x2014; On the whole I am enjoying life at present more than I have done for a very long time. the weather is fine, a great many people are kind to me, and my Mother is in capital good humour&#x2014; My mind too is free from any weight of anxiety, and tho&#x2019; I am still delicate the most painful sensation of my illness, a continual violent beating at my heart, is quite removed; and then I am not bored with dressing myself, and driving about to parties&#x2014;to be sure I am idle nevertheless; but an industrious future is before me, and a determined purpose within my breast. I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> study <hi rend="italic">will</hi> if the Fates are but pleased to spin the thread of my life a little longer; <pb id="pg-03-25" n="03:25"/>so no matter for a week or two more of idleness&#x2014; You see you will really make a Philosopher of me at last&#x2014;</p>
<p>I will not leave town till you come unless you are all the longer&#x2014;I told my Mother so the other night. but when will you come? On Saturday the tenth you say&#x2014;now I do not know how you reckon time in Perthshire; but with us in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Saturday is the seventh and the tenth is Tuesday&#x2014;so which day is the right one? The earliest I hope&#x2014;send me a note as soon as you arrive and I will tell you the where and when&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> see you and Meister and Schiller and all in spite of the Devil</p>
<p>You are looking for the rest of my Tragedy of the little Physician&#x2014; Well then, get ready your handkerchief and volatile Salts and you shall have it&#x2014;such as it is&#x2014;</p>
<p>I believe I told you that we parted with one another in dudgeon, after the high words that passed betwixt us concerning you&#x2014; Well, he absented himself for three days, and in the interim I became seriously ill. As I was not minded to <hi rend="italic">solicit</hi> his return, I applied to his Partner, <hi rend="italic">who was in the way</hi> for advice.

I read it three times over however before I could see into what he would be at&#x2014;the first time every thing grew dark around me, and images of horror swam before my sight&#x2014;pistols and blood, and turned heads, and broken hearts, and Lord knows what! Oh dear me I never doubted but he meant to blow his brains out at the least&#x2014; However on examining it more attentively I found that I was alarming myself without cause&#x2014;for it was a clear case, that no man driven to despair and looking in the face of death, (Not John Thurtell<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18240121-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1824-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref></note> himself) could have written such a letter&#x2014;people so utterly wretched as he represented himself to be, do not express their anguish in metaphors and smart antithesis and elegant climaxes; neither do the<supplied>[y]</supplied> stop in the very middle of their pathos to mend their pens or to erase a misspelled word; and as fast as all this occur<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed to me my terror gave place to indignation and contempt. It was so unfeeling! So unmanly! to attempt to work on me by my fears, when I was so weak and ill&#x2014; Hotbrained Ass! his cruel folly might have cost my life in the state which I was in&#x2014;and it <hi rend="italic">did</hi> do me a deal of harm; for several days I was so nervous that the least stir in my room made me cry like a very infant&#x2014;however he was nothing the better for my weakness&#x2014; I did not answer him a single line&#x2014; So there, this was one trial withstood, and bravely&#x2014;for I really had not fair play in the business&#x2014; For three weeks all went right&#x2014; I sometimes heard my magnanimous lover calling his Groom, and I heard his horses go out and come in as usual; so it was certain that he was still in the land of the living, and for the rest I gave myself small concern about him; on the contrary I was quite overjoyed to have got myself rid of his love with so little ado. But at the end of this period another trial awaited me. The unhappy little being became ill&#x2014;so alarmingly ill <pb id="pg-03-27" n="03:27"/>that his life was despaired of; and his distemper (the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> said) was a troubled mind. and Betty<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid, the maid.</note> declared it was <hi rend="italic">trouble</hi> for me; for he had sent for her (she said) to his bedside and asked for her Brother; but he looked in her face as if he wanted to ask about me, and could not for shame&#x2014; Who would have imagined Betty so skilled in physiognomy? You cannot think what I suffered during the first four days of his illness when the answer to all our inquiries was still &#x2018;no better&#x2019;&#x2014; It <hi rend="italic">was</hi> possible that distress about me might have brought him to this extremity&#x2014;and if such was actually the case, possibly it rested with me to save him, to save a fellow creature, the hope of an indigent family, the kind Son of an affectionate Mother the elder Brother of seven little Sisters&#x2014;but at what a price! these thoughts were continually in my mind and tortured me&#x2014; I sickened when the<supplied>[y]</supplied> talked of his bleedings, and his faintings, and his delirium&#x2014;and at last I took to my bed and lay there for two days, in a state of agony worthy of the Inferno&#x2014; Had he died I could never have enjoyed tranquillity again, and neither could I, had I saved his life by the sacrifice of my self&#x2014;but alls well that ends well&#x2014; it began to be said that his ailment was <hi rend="italic">inflam<supplied>[m]</supplied>ation of the bowels</hi> and in a day or two he was declared to be out of danger&#x2014; I have heard of him frequently since I came to town, and he is continuing to recover strength&#x2014; God be praised&#x2014; So now you have my story, what do you think of it?&#x2014; did you ever hear of such a vexatious Doctor in all your life?</p>
<p>You will observe that part of my letter was written several days ago&#x2014; I looked pale in the midst of it, and my Mother sent me to bed&#x2014; it was a pity (I thought) to be laid up for nothing, and so I took a violent cold that has played the very deuce with me ever since. I have not been able to finish it till today, and now it is too late to address to you at Kinnaird if you are to be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Saturday&#x2014; However I shall send my letter to your Brothers to wait your coming; that you may see my delay has not been willful&#x2014; God bless you ever</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I yesterday for the first time got a sight of your letter; and, you see, I am not slow in answering the friendly solicitude which it breathes, by the return most agreeable to you, a prompt account of my history since I wrote last. This will be no difficult task. My days and my nights were full of <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> to the exclusion of almost every other subject, till near the end of last week, when after the most obstinate efforts on my part the third and last portion of it was concluded and sealed up, an event which gave more pleasure than any that had happened to me for a month. This third Part is a very long-winded story, nearly as long as both the other two: I am longing very much to get it sent off, and printed and completely despatched from my thoughts. It has <pb id="pg-03-30" n="03:30"/>cost me some labour: if I find nothing better to do, I will enlarge it, brush it up, and have it printed as a separate Book.</p>
<p>After the completion of this notable undertaking, little remained for me but to make ready and go down to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, whither the elder part of the Buller family had gone about ten days before. The younkers and I lived in great harmony tho&#x2019; rather in a hugger-mugger style of accommodation, our only servant being a boy of seventeen, as awkward as a cub, and who I think must have impoverished Mrs B. considerably by his breakages of china and glass-ware. It had been settled that I was to remain till Friday-night last; then to set out for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and have two months of my own to get Meister printed in. Accordingly on Friday-night, one of the wettest ever seen, I sallied forth about 8 o&#x2019;clock in the gig beside Arthur, who had been preferred so far as to have the driving of me thro&#x2019; the tempest down to Dunkeld. On arriving there, we found an ancient, bullet-headed, smoke-dried, sharp-tempered personage, the Perth Post, waiting with his gig to take me fifteen miles farther. I was muffled up in clothes like an Egyptian mummy, had on a thick great-coat and an umbrella; so did not greatly mind the wind and rain, but reached Perth between midnight and one in the morning, without much inconvenience. A coach or rather many coaches start from this place for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, at seven in the morning. Of course, I got next to no repose: a rascal above me alarmed the whole establishment about four in the morning with a noise like the &#x201C;taking of Sebastian,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wellington&#x2019;s assault (<date when="1813">1813</date>) on San Sebastian, which precipitated the ensuing nine-day battle of the Pyrenees.</note> and I did not fall asleep again till near six, when my own turn came. We had no bad ride to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I myself having all the inside to lie and lounge in without interruption from any living thing. One of the first persons I met in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> was the broad substantial truthful Jack, coming down to inquire for letters from me. After dinner and much talk, we went out to look for rooms. O that it might please the Upper Powers never never more in this or any other world to set me out again on such an enterprise! My heart grows black as midnight when I think of all the mean torments I have undergone in that matter, since first I became a sickly, a captious and a discontented wanderer on the face of the earth. We met with royal specimens yesterday! Some were palpable bawdy-houses, some had landladies the very image of Martha Calvert,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Described by Alick in his letter of <date when="1824-02-15">15 Feb.</date> only as a neighbor with a &#x201C;strongly marked image.&#x201D;</note> all were dreary, squalid, untenantable, the very look of them enough to make one take a passage <pb id="pg-03-31" n="03:31"/>in the mail that very night. At length by great good luck, we heard of the people here, and found a room in their house combining the unspeakable advantages of quietness and fresh air, and known neighbourhood. Martin of Kirkcaldy<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Samuel Martin, Mrs. Edward Irving&#x2019;s brother. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210225-TC-JCE-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCE</corr>, <date when="1821-02-25">25 Feb. 1821</date></ref>.</note> and others of our acquaintance lodged in it last year. I took it very readily, tho&#x2019; the rent was 10 / aweek, and the room is not so good as Wilkie&#x2019;s which both Jack and I had the use of for 9 /. But what is money to the unspeakable horrors of sluttishness and noise and vulgar base debauchery? Last night I had a sleep of eight hours; which I would not exchange for gold. To-day, I am still <hi rend="italic">feckless</hi> and dispirited, but infinitely better than I was: another day will quite reinstate me.</p>
<p>I have got leave of the Bullers for three months, two of which it was understood, I should devote to the translating and printing of the German Novel, and the third to seeing you all at Mainhill, instead of August; after which I was to join them in London, thenceforth proceeding to the burgh of Looe in Cornwall, and establishing myself permanently there as the Tutor of their eldest son. This plan I feel inclined to to [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] break thro&#x2019; in some respects. With regard to the Book, I have not yet seen Oliver &#x26; Boyd; but I feel inclined to suppose that the printing of it might proceed without interruption, tho&#x2019; I were at Mainhill, the sheets being sent me by the Post. In case therefore I find myself uncomfortable in this lodging or wearied of the city, it seems very likely that I may make some arrangement of that kind, and call upon you to &#x201C;come up with your two able horses&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick&#x2019;s offer in his letter of <date when="1824-02-02">2 Feb.</date></note> sooner than you anticipate. I long much to be home: I have known no approach to health since I left it. I think I could sit in the room with my fire and desk, and work with the greatest alacrity. I could also have Dolph to ride on, and all you kind souls to talk with: I should be very happy. In a week or two I shall be able to tell you more.</p>
<p>With regard to our ulterior proceedings about this <hi rend="italic">farm</hi>, it is needless to attempt discussing the subject minutely on paper, when we have the near prospect of discussing it so much better by word of mouth. The<supplied>[re]</supplied> seems to be little danger that we s<supplied>[hall]</supplied> be able to fall on some scheme of a suitable sort. The sole object which <hi rend="italic">I</hi> need is a little modicum of health; with that I can undertake to earn my bread in the most independent manner. You have strength and experience, I have capital; we are true to one another: doubt not we shall be able to make it out. I declare I often wonder that you have <pb id="pg-03-32" n="03:32"/>not grown altogether tired of me, and my weak whimsical sufferings, as to you it is not unnatural that they should seem. You have stood faithful to me long: the worst is now past; let us not despair of the issue, or faint when the goal is in view. On the whole I am not averse to go to Cornwall, at least for a time, and if I had a suitable place of abode. T<supplied>[he]</supplied> people <supplied>[here have]</supplied> behaved well to me: they have all along treated me with the greatest <supplied>[con]</supplied>sideration; of late, they even seem to have some glimmer of affection for <supplied>[me]</supplied>. My small <hi rend="italic">authorial</hi> labours have elevated me <supplied>[in]</supplied> their esteem; and it says not a <supplied>[little]</supplied> for people such as they are to value intellectual <supplied>[w]</supplied>orth at a higher rate than any other. <supplied>[If]</supplied> Mrs B. to her other gifts added the indispensible one of being a good housewife, one might live very happily beside her. Buller I have all a<supplied>[long]</supplied> esteemed a very unadulterated specimen of an English gentleman: he is truly honest to the very heart. If I have recovered, as I expect to do at Mainhill, I shall feel no objection to go forth and see them and London both at once. Tell my dear and over-anxious mother, that going to Cornwall is as easy as going to Waterbeck,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A community four miles NE of Ecclefechan.</note> for any danger there is in it: the people also are good sober Christians, and will use me no way but well. Tomorrow I am to see Buller, and he will tell me more distinctly what they are minded to do. Mrs B. I saw to-day; she was very sickly, having wanted sleep &#x26;c ever since she left Kinnaird; but she was very kind and pleasant. They return to Kinnaird in three or four days, and stay there till the beginning of April.</p>
<p>I have been so busy telling you these small but not to you indifferent matters that I have never had time to thank you for the very spirited and pleasing account you gave us of all that was going on about you. Jack and I were not a little amused, and I felt more than mere amusement at the operations of our little sisters and the sedate <hi rend="italic">austere</hi> &#x201C;Mr Carlyle&#x201D; at the Post-office.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1824-02-02">2 Feb.</date> Alick had told how Jane, Mary, or Jenny would one at a time during the day steal away from the other two and run to the post office to see if a letter had come down from Edinburgh or Kinnaird. Young Jamie, the &#x201C;sedate <hi rend="italic">austere</hi> &#x2018;Mr Carlyle,&#x2019;&#x201D; who was invariably ahead of them all, would by his deportment hope to save each of his sisters (and probably himself) from a teasing by amused witnesses.</note> Dear little things! I will see them all repaid yet. As for Mr C. I love him for his innate honesty, and vigour of mind, as well as no small promise of talent more strictly intellectual. Is he still at school? Tell him to improve the passing hour, and let me find him incalculably improved at my return. Tell the three small children to write to me by the carrier, and I will answer. Is Mag still <pb id="pg-03-33" n="03:33"/>in the old way? I never hear a whisper of her; tho she is often in my thoughts.&#x2014; What on earth, as you say, can have tempted the infatuated Dominie<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One whom Alick (<date when="1824-02-02">2 Feb.</date>) calls &#x201C;little Brown, the Preacher (afterwards teacher) <supplied>[who]</supplied> is to be married to Margaret Farries or what is much the same, is to be hen-pecked, shackled&#x2014;&#x26; pinn<supplied>[i]</supplied>oned down &#x2018;in an iron cage for life.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> to wed in such a manner? I could not or cannot yet understand how any mortal should have thought of such a match. But it is he not us that has to pay the piper: so heaven speed him in this new voyage he is making. I would not stand in his shoes for infinite sums. I liked your criticism on Cobbett very well: so far as I have examined the work, you seemed to have formed a perfectly accurate view of it. He overdoes every thing: yet much may be learned from his shrewd practical experience. I long to get another letter from you, detailing all that you are doing or about to do.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I write to you in the greatest haste; the Carrier&#x2019;s affair having been as usual mismanaged. His box I did not hear of till two o&#x2019;clock: and after dining and unpacking my articles, I have come up to Jack&#x2019;s room, where I now sit writing. Jack is gone out (to dine, they said; tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">where</hi> I cannot guess) and is not to be in again till late. The Waffler or whoever it was that brought the box, charged 1/4 for it; so that I suppose he will need no farther pay. He hurries me extremely with his movements: so I must write to you most incoherently; but better so, than not at all.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-34" n="03:34"/>I need not tell you how glad I am to learn of your welfare: it is a blessing we have long enjoyed; but for which we can never be thankful enough. It often strikes me to the heart to think that one day this state of things must alter, and some of us be sent to &#x201C;that undiscovered Country, from whose bourne no traveller returns&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, i.</note> leaving for the rest a gap in the circle which can never more be filled! But it is very useless to vex one&#x2019;self with the foretaste of evils which will be bitter enough when they arrive. Let us hope that the date may be distant, the blow soft, and the reunion speedy! I wonder what has put me on this serious sermonising vein. I must leave it.</p>
<p>Your letter is full of rugged ingenuity: but there is only one point in it, which I can find any leisure to discuss&#x2014;writing in this style, at full gallop, and in another&#x2019;s house. I al<supplied>[l]</supplied>ude to the question of my homecoming. Often, often does this come thro&#x2019; my own head: I long to revisit Mainhill, as if healing lay there for my afflicted carcass, and of course afflicted mind. My lodgings in Moray-street are I think of the best description, quiet, cleanly and orderly. Yet I am not in health: I do not reckon myself better, some times almost worse, than I was in the highlands. &#x201C;Sleep! Sleep! O gentle sleep!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">II Henry IV</hi>, III, i.</note>&#x2014;I do not, I cannot get enough of it. I am in consequence obliged to take drugs almost every day, and the result of this is easy enough to discover. I ask myself often what I am doing in this accursed place, which for many years has been to me the scene of woes, greater than the heart of man has formed an image of. The answer is, I am printing a book, and must hold at it for a while; but that when it is done&#x2014;Quick, March! is the word. In truth, I believe, part of the secret is I am or rather was working too hard. Half the book is yet to translate: I set about doing sixteen pages of it per-day; <hi rend="italic">did</hi> thus much for three days, and then felt unutterably sick and downcast. I have since been contented with nine.</p>
<p>In fact I believe the best plan for me will be to go on with the business leisurely; and see if I can get <hi rend="italic">home</hi> to work at it<supplied>[.]</supplied> Riding two hours per day on Bardolph would do more for me than all the drugs in nature. The Doctor Bell I called on one day, and found just going out. I promised to call again. He said he understood I was quite <hi rend="italic">well</hi>!! &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Well!!!</hi>&#x201D; I told him in our fathers tone. I believe him to be a consummate ass: the first morning I can get up in time, I design to go and settle with him and pay him off entirely. His mercury seems to have <pb id="pg-03-35" n="03:35"/>done me a considerable quantity of mischief; and as for the giving up of my dearest tobacco, I cannot find that it has produced in me the very smallest improvement.</p>
<p>You will think me very miserable, when you read this letter. But no: I am not miserable at all; only today, I am rather worse than usual; and this is <hi rend="italic">after dinner</hi>. If I had a little health, there is nothing I have reason to care for the want of. Even as it is, I contrive in general to get along very reasonably. Jack comes down to me <hi rend="italic">every night</hi>: we have a talk and a walk: we correct the Printer&#x2019;s sheets together, and are very happy. He is a kind faithful slut of a fellow. I have twice or thrice been mentioning to him my purpose of going home; but he does not seem to approve it. On the whole, I can yet say nothing definite on the subject. Next week I have to see Brewster and settle accounts with him; I shall then make investigations about the possibility of printing and living at Mainhill. I know it is possible enough: but what the extent of sacrifice is I do not know. If I grow any worse, or even no better, I will write to you in about a week, appointing to meet you.</p>
<p>Now my dear Alick, you must pardon all this confusion and obscurity; for I write in the most extreme hurlyburly of mind and now it is grown <supplied>[too]</supplied> dark to mend the matter. Write to me by the post if I delay writing home too long: it is far better than by the carrier, especially so uncertain a genius as Farries.</p>
<p>Thank my dear kind Mother for the eggs and cakes: I know not how I shall consume them they are so many. The eggs here are on the point of rottenness, so I had given them up. I meant to write to my Mother. But alas! it is close dark before I have finished this: and I have not yet written <hi rend="italic">one</hi> line of my translation! Give my heart&#x2019;s love to Father and Mother and every soul about Mainhill. God bless you all forever! <closer><salute>I am your true Brother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dearest Friend</salute>
<p>You predicted sensibly enough that my conscience would punish me, for behaving to you in such a very nonsensical manner&#x2014; You had no sooner taken yourself off, pulling the door to, with such a vengeance behind you; than I was ready to hang myself for having occasioned you pain, and wasted such a fine opportunity for conversing with one another freely, as may not occur to us again for God knows how long&#x2014; I do not know how it was&#x2014; I believe the Devil tempted me to be absurd and ill humoured at the outset; and your imperturbable patience provoked me to continue so until the end&#x2014; And now that I am come to myself I appear far more despicable in my own sight than I can possibly do in yours. unkind to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> who are always so kind to me, so zealous to serve me, so solicitous for my welfare! Can you forgive me? indeed, indeed I do love you and respect you (for all my nonsense) as well I may&#x2014; Say that you forgive me that you love me not a whit the less for my yesterday&#x2019;s <foreign>tirevee</foreign>;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A fit of passion, or tantrum.</note> and I will give you a whole dozen of voluntary kisses at the earliest opportunity. Think of this&#x2014;I assure you I never offered such liberal terms of reconciliation to mortal man before&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now when am I to see you and hear your mind on the matter? My Mother has made an appointment for me tomorrow at half after eleven; so that supposing you were to come at the usual time I could not remain with you above a few minutes&#x2014; Next day we return to Haddington; but I shall pack my duds the night before and endeavour to be at leisure from eleven till twelve if you will call then&#x2014;idiot that I was, to kick to the devil the two good hours that fortune offered me to talk with you! I do not think you can forgive me in your heart&#x2014; Can you? <closer><salute>You will call on Tuesday however,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Yours most penitentially /</salute></closer> <name>Jane B Welsh</name>

He went along with me to the coach that he might <hi rend="italic">catch you at once</hi>; but it is by no means so easy to catch a Genius as a Tiger&#x2014;we waited for you to no purpose&#x2014; However I did get a sort of farewell look of you; and for the Indian rubber it is the best that ever rubbed, and the paper is not sandpaper; but even makes pretence to be transparent (tho&#x2019; I cannot trace the blackest line through it for all that) so that on the whole I have not much cause to complain of you&#x2014; I should have liked to have received your blessing however (<foreign>pour parenth&#xE8;se</foreign>&#x2014;how many shillings am I in your debt?)</p>

<p>&#x2026; With regard to my home-coming, I have been of various minds. &#x2026; I at last hit on this expedient. I am to translate and print the first two volumes of the book; and whenever these are finished, I set off for home; there to translate the third, and not to trouble Edinburgh with my presence till this is ready for the press. It can after that be printed in ten days; and I get it managed as I pass through the place here, on my way to London. This at last has been agreed to by all parties. I am accordingly very busy getting my part of it done: I translate ten pages daily; at which rate, I shall be through my allotted task and ready to start for the country somewhat less than three weeks after the present date. Whether or not the Printers will be ready then is another question: <pb id="pg-03-40" n="03:40"/>but on the whole, you may count on seeing me come down before the beginning of April, to stay about a month. I am as anxious on the subject as any one of you; Mainhill is associated in my mind with ideas of peace and kindness and health of body and mind, such as I do not elsewhere enjoy.</p>
<p>Beyond the circle of my books and papers, I have nothing to do with this heartless and conceited place: I have called on no man since I came within the walls of it; and I care no jot if on turning my back on it three weeks hence, I should never see the vain and hungry visage of it any more. I must call on Brewster to settle accounts; old Dr. Fleming I ought also to see, for the sake of some emblem of kindness I experienced from him; Dr. Gordon also, if I have time; and then my circle of visits will be concluded. There is one Pearse Gillies,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Pierce Gillies (<sic><date when="1788">1788</date></sic><corr><date when="1789">1789</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1858">1858</date>), a friend of Scott and correspondent of Wordsworth, had lived a year in Germany and had met Goethe.

<salute>My dearly beloved Critic,</salute>
<p>Your letter came to me on Tuesday morning: it found me bending under the weight of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> like an Ass below two dust-<foreign>paniers</foreign>, and relieved me with a touch of nourishment and hope. I determined to answer it on Sunday: and here accordingly I sit scribbling to you, as if there were no gospel in the country. I know, it is very wrong; but how am I to help it? Throughout the week, it is second only to the Brixton Treadmill;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brixton was a London prison. The treadmill was legalized as a prison occupation by the <date when="1779">1779</date> Penitentiary Act and came into more widespread and effective use after <date when="1818">1818</date>, when Sir William Cubitt (<date when="1785">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861">1861</date>) invented a simple form of it.</note> nothing but write and walk, walk and write from morn to midnight. Besides I have no seat in their Kirks, nor are their <pb id="pg-03-41" n="03:41"/>parsons of the kind I like to hear. From all which premises, the inference is plain.</p>
<p>I <supplied>[n]</supplied>oticed your sarcastic looks in the coach, and expected your new sally on my <hi rend="italic">genius</hi>. But alas! if you knew the whole history of that adventure, what obstacles I had to overcome, what exertions to make, I know you would feel your mind <hi rend="italic">subdued</hi> with reverence for my dexterity, despatch and <foreign><hi rend="italic">savoir faire</hi></foreign>, as it is already struck with admiration of my graces and chivalrous accomplishments. I have magnanimity enough to pass it over in silence! You praise the Indian Rubber, and ask me what your debt is. A question easy to answer! Simply a <hi rend="italic">dozen</hi> (shillings,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Understood by both to be kisses.</note> for books paper &#x26;c &#x26;c), a dozen, lying out at the highest rate of legal interest, and payable on demand. I suppose you design becoming bankrupt; but you had better not.</p>
<p>Our friend the Tiger seems to be a genius also; at least he usurps the privileges of one. I have seen no glimpse and heard no whisper of him, since you went away. This is somewhat unlucky, as I go to the country very soon, and wished to take Gillies&#x2019; books with me. To complete the matter, Dr Irving<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. David Irving, of the Advocates&#x2019; Library.</note> has taken a <hi rend="italic">stitch in his side</hi>, and cannot be spoken with. To morrow I am going to write to Pierce<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Pierce Gillies.</note> for his tomes: if he like to lend them,&#x2014;well; if not, no harm is done: I have no other matter with him</p>
<p>I heartily wish you were back among these Tigers and people, to amuse yourself here. Haddington is not the place for you at all. Both your mother and you would be infinitely happier in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Would she not send you hither to look out for some beautiful cottage in the middle of a garden, down about Trinity<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An area near Leith on the Forth, but farther west.</note> or some other of the suburbs? I do hope she will ultimately be prevailed upon. Heaven knows, I have little cause to like Edinburgh; and I do for my own sake in general heartily despise, or sometimes what is far worse, detest it: yet I feel that you would be much more in your element here; much more pleasantly as well as advantageously situated for all the purposes you have in view. Do not tell me that I am meddling with an affair which I am not concerned in: nothing that might render your life more comfortable or successful can be indifferent to me.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I am glad to observe that you have fallen upon the only plan which can drive away the tedium of your present residence; a sedulous practice of study and intellectual amusement. It is pity <pb id="pg-03-42" n="03:42"/>on the whole that you have abandoned Gibbon; but it is of no use to struggle against the stream. Dr Johnson said with considerable justice, that it was hardly ever adviseable to read any book, against your inclination.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Boswell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi>, ed. R. W. Chapman (London, <date when="1960">1960</date>), p. 870.</note> Where the inclination is averse, the attention will wander, do as you will. I recollect reading Harte&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Gustavus Adolphus</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Harte (<date when="1709">1709</date>&#x2013;<date when="1774">74</date>), <hi rend="italic">The History of the Life of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, Surnamed the Great</hi>, 2 vols. (London, <date when="1759">1759</date>).</note> with an immense sacrifice of feeling to will; and I remembered less of it than of any book I ever perused. I trust by and by you will resume Gibbon, and finish both him and Hume. Do you like Robertson?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Robertson, whose <hi rend="italic">History of Charles V</hi> (<date when="1769">1769</date>) Jane was reading.</note> I used to find in him a shrewd, a systematic, but not a great understanding; and no more heart than in my boot. He was a kind of Deist in the guise of a Calvinistic priest; a portentous combination! But if you are for fiery-spirited men, I recommend you to the Abb&#xE9; Raynal,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Guillaume T. F. Raynal (<date when="1713">1713</date>&#x2013;<date when="1796">96</date>), French historian and philosopher, educated for the priesthood but a freethinker. His <hi rend="italic">Histoire philosophique et politique des &#xE9;tablissements &#x2026; dans les deux Indes</hi> (<date when="1770">1770</date>) was in <date when="1781">1781</date> by order of Parliament publicly burned because of its attacks on Europeans for their treatment of the natives of the Indies.</note> whose History at least the edition of <date when="1781">1781</date>, is, to use the words of my tailor respecting Africa, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">wan coll</hi> (one coal) of burning sulphur.&#x201D; Of this by and by. Meantime, I fear you are again erring in excess. Four hours a-day you ought to regard as a complete allowance for serious study: the rest of the day, you should not employ in any thing but what yields you enjoyment for its own sake. Tell me most minutely how you get along; what portions of your plan you find executeable; when you rise in the mornings; what part of Rubezahl is done; and what <hi rend="italic">are</hi> your general occupations. I do not think, you should rise till you like, each particular morning. Life has many hours and days in it; tho&#x2019; you and I consider it, in our imaginations, as a thing that is travelling more swiftly than a hyppogriff.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ariosto&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Orlando Furioso</hi>, in which Astolfo rides the hippogriff to the moon to fetch back the lost wits of Orlando.</note> If I could <hi rend="italic">get</hi> any &#x201C;feathers to sit upon,&#x201D; I should let your &#x201C;fame&#x201D; travel whither soever it listed. But there is no rest for the wicked. Necessity like a strong &#x201C;Black-whipper&#x201D; drives us all before him: when hope has sunk or faded in front of us, <hi rend="italic">his</hi> scourge is heard cracking in our rear. But what I meant to say has not much to do with him or his scourges: it was merely that <hi rend="italic">four hours</hi> daily is more than one literary man out of a thousand gets bestowed on purely intellectual operations. Therefore be content. <pb id="pg-03-43" n="03:43"/>The student is always studying: but of book-learning there are limits. I think a person in four years might gain nearly all the really valuable and original ideas that can be drawn from books. Mercy on us! What preaching!&#x2014; I am done.</p>
<p>Monday Morning.&#x2014;They have sent me down the remaining sheets of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>; which I must now wrap up and send to you. &#x201C;Out of economical motives&#x201D; do not send me back <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of them. Keep them all lying together in some of your desks or drawers; and when the number is complete, we will have them bound together by way of curiosity, and keep them as a monument of pleasant times. In other respects they are worth nothing: so if you happen to lose one or two of them, do not fret about it: you are to have another copy the moment the book is finished. I fear, however, you will never read it: the romance, you see, is still dull as ever. There is not properly speaking the smallest particle of <hi rend="italic">historical</hi> interest in it, except what is connected with Mignon; and her you cannot see fully, till near the very end. Meister himself is perhaps one of the greatest <foreign><hi rend="italic">ganaches</hi></foreign> [block-heads] that ever was created by quill and ink. I am going to write a fierce preface, disdaining all concern with the literary or the moral merit of the work; grounding my claims to recompense or toleration on the fact that I have accurately copied a striking portrait of Goethe&#x2019;s mind, the strangest and in many points the greatest now extant. What a work! Bushels of dust and straws and feathers, with here and there a diamond of the purest water!<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the &#x201C;Translator&#x2019;s Preface&#x201D; to the first edition of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi>, 3 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1824">1824</date>), while praising the work for its liveliness, thoughtfulness, and eloquence, Carlyle remarks that its &#x201C;hero is a milksop, whom, with all his gifts, it takes an effort to avoid despising&#x201D;; and warns &#x201C;the great mass of readers, who read to drive away the tedium of mental vacancy, employing the crude phantasmagoria of a modern novel, as their grandfathers employed tobacco and diluted brandy,&#x201D; that &#x201C;Wilhelm Meister will appear beyond endurance weary, flat, stale, and unprofitable.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>My chief wish at present is that it were done. We get along dreadfully slow: the creatures are printing what they call &#x201C;Session&#x201D;; that is law-papers, &#x26; unless I went to bully them every second day, I believe they would stop altogether. As it is, I perceive we shall not be done in April, scarcely even in May. In consequence of this combined with my determination to spend at least a month in Annandale for the sake both of my health and my heart, we have changed our plans a little. So soon as the second volume is concluded, I retire to Mainhill to translate the remainder at my leisure; it is to be printed when I return hither on my way to London. <hi rend="italic">Then</hi> also I will come to <pb id="pg-03-44" n="03:44"/>Haddington, and stay till your Mother and you are heartily tired of me. I think it will be very pretty for a time, however; so you must try if you can make room for me. I hope to be in Annandale about three weeks hence; a fortnight was the time specified, but I see clearly, it cannot be. For the present I am higgling with the well-fed bibliopolist about pecuniary terms. We went into the business without a word formally said on the matter; but in a day or two the thing must now be finally reduced to black and white, and these money-changers prevented from cozening me out of sixpence that is mine. Brewster, the other morning, disclosed to me such a scene of the villainies of these base earthy bloodsuckers the Booksellers, as was enough to make one&#x2019;s hair &#x201C;to stand on end, like quills upon the fretful porcupine.&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, I, v.</note> Boyd sent me a long paper of terms; thro&#x2019; the fair exterior of which, illuminated by the experience of the scientific doctor I was enabled to descry a thousand inlets for pettyfogging. So I appended two small and simple conditions, on which the man has ruminated since Saturday without reply. The first was that &#xa3;250 should be my net share of the proceeds of the first 1000 copies: the second that after 3000 copies had been sold, the book was to be <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> and my heirs&#x2019; forever and ever. Thus it stands at present. I will reduce the &#xa3;250 to &#xa3;200, if they entreat for it; but no lower: if they do not like my terms, we shall part company and get another tradesman: Brewster offers to be my half in the speculation, upon reasonable terms. Do you dare you unreasonable tyrant to call me a genius any more? I swear I am no genius at all; but a most expert youth. My conduct like that of her late Majesty is guided in all points by &#x201C;perfect wisdom&#x201D;:<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a phrase from an obituary on Queen Caroline, of notorious memory, who had died <date when="1821-08-07">7 Aug. 1821</date>.</note> I know of nothing foolish in it, except perhaps my love f<supplied>[or]</supplied> you&#x2014;which I often think will lead me a wild dance yet. Yet I do som<supplied>[etim]</supplied>es think you an Angel. At any rate, Fate not I am to blame in the matter. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ich kann nicht anders</hi></foreign> [I cannot do otherwise].<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Martin Luther&#x2019;s statement at the Diet of Worms: <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Hier stehe ich, ich kann nicht anders, Gott helfe mir. Amen.&#x201D;</hi></foreign></note></p>
<p>Now when will you write to me again? Consider Madam that you are your own taskmistress: what is to hinder you from writing me a sheet, per day? Yet I must own you are very good to me; and I ought not to press you farther. Will you write this week? I beg you will excuse this most barbarous letter: you know how I am hurried and spurred to death. At any rate we have now been friends for centuries, <pb id="pg-03-45" n="03:45"/>and will be to the end of time. What matters it how or what we write? Will you present my kindest regards to your Mother: is she recovered completely? Be sure you tell me. If she mishappen, <foreign><hi rend="italic">que deviendrez vous</hi></foreign> [what will become of you]! <closer><salute>God b<supplied>[less]</supplied> you <foreign><hi rend="italic">meine Eigene</hi></foreign> [my own]!

<p><salute>Dearest!</salute> I looked for your letter on monday as my reward for a weeks diligence; and I was not disappointed. It is very good of you to write me such charming long letters, when you are over head and ears in business. Indeed I can never wonder enough at your kindness to me in all things; it is really <hi rend="italic">very affecting</hi>! God grant that some day or other I may deserve it! this hope is the only thing that keeps me from quar<supplied>[r]</supplied>elling with myself outright, when I think of all my demerits in the time past. I declare I am very much of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Kemp&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230218-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-02-18">18 Feb. 1823</date></ref>.</note> way of thinking, that &#x2018;certain persons are possessed of devils even in the present times.&#x2019; Nothing less than a Devil (I am sure) could have tempted me to torment you and myself, as I did, on that unblessed day. Woe to me then! if I had had any other than the most constant and generous of mortal men to deal with. Blessings on your equanimity and magnanimity! you are a dear, good, patient <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi>. You are sure you forgive me? forgive me in the very core of your heart? I would rather pay you another dozen of <hi rend="italic">shillings</hi> than that you should bear me the smallest grudge.</p>
<p>For the first time these great many months I am not ashamed to tell you how I have been living. For <hi rend="italic">two whole weeks</hi> I have rigidly adhered to my new system. It will a<supplied>[n]</supplied>swer well I find. By the help of the Lord I have been upon my feet every morning by half after seven; and throughout the day I have not suffered anything or anybody to interfere with my tasks. Indeed it will be all my own fault if I relapse into idleness in my present circumstances: for there are very few obstacles, and no temptations at all in the way of my industry. My Archenemy headach<supplied>[e]</supplied> is fairly beaten off the field; and what with the explosion of the combustible Doctor, and the progress of the <hi rend="italic">Lewinists</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Holy alliance</hi> as it is called heer, I am delivered from many interruptions that used to vex me grievously<supplied>[.]</supplied> This D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lewins (you must know) is a rascally practitioner of medicine, who settled here as an opponent to my Uncle Benjamin, and waged an exterminating pamphlet-war against him. But my poor Uncle was an overmatch for him; the excited feelings of the whole county were on <hi rend="italic">his</hi> side; his <hi rend="italic">name</hi> was deemed a sufficient guarantee for his ability and honourable conduct; and the proper spirit with which he met the other&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-03-47" n="03:47"/>attacks, <foreign><hi rend="italic">non timens bella non provocans</hi></foreign> [neither shunning nor seeking the fight], obliged him at last to desist. If the hotheaded Doctor had depen<supplied>[d]</supplied>ed for a livelihood on the favour of the public, he must have long ago either starved, or shifted his quarters; but as the devil would have it, his wife has a handsome jointure, and he can give dinners and run a fine gig without asking anyone&#x2019;s leave, and so it is; tho&#x2019; four years ago he was hooted out of all decent company as a lying unfeeling Bravo, he has so dined and gig<supplied>[g]</supplied>ed himself into favour again that a powerful faction has conspired to bear him out through thick and thin. Our connection with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Howden,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Professional partner of Jane&#x2019;s father. Robert Lewins published, in criticism of the organization of the recently founded Dispensary and in opposition to Benjamin Welsh&#x2019;s appointment as Medical Attendant, an <hi rend="italic">Address to the General Body of Contributors to the Haddington Dispensary</hi> (Haddington, <date when="1820">1820</date>). In reply Welsh and his supporters published <hi rend="italic">The Minutes of the Haddington Dispensary</hi> (Haddington, <date when="1820">1820</date>), containing correspondence with Lewins and refuting his claims to have been the originator of the idea and, therefore, entitled to consultation at least. Lewins responded quickly with <hi rend="italic">Strictures on &#x201C;The Minutes of the Haddington Dispensary,&#x201D; Addressed to the Managers</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1820">1820</date>); and a further exchange of letters between the principals was published in an appendix. While Lewins&#x2019; main animosity was reserved for Dr. Benjamin Welsh, he also attacked Dr. Thomas Howden&#x2014;professional partner of Jane&#x2019;s late father. Jane must be referring here to a resurgence of the <date when="1820">1820</date> controversy.</note> as well as the reccolection of his infamous conduct towards my Uncle requires that we should set our faces stoutly against such doings: and the rivalry and animosity that is betwixt our party and his is come to such a pitch that I am in daily expectation of a general running to arms. It is not D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fyffes fault that we are not at it tooth and nail by this time: he has twice given Lewins the lie to his face; but no challenge has ensued&#x2014;nor will&#x2014; That gallant D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> likes better to fight with pens than with pistols; <foreign><hi rend="italic">quietissimus in ipsa discrimine qui ante discrimen fortissimus</hi></foreign> [he who was boldest before was meekest in the fight].<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Loosely based on Tacitus, <hi rend="italic">Historiae</hi>, I, 84.</note> But this is a most unmerciful digression&#x2014;however if you knew with what party fury every individual hereabouts has entered into this medical contest you would not wonder that I have caught the infection of it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;This sordid burgh-squabble has an important bearing, and this long account of it cannot well be omitted, for it explains one of the chief causes of Miss Welsh&#x2019;s dislike to Haddington, and her refusal to reside there after her marriage to Carlyle&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> What I was meaning to explain to you is that in consequence of the split in our commonwealth not to hard a manner for me to keep to the regulations which I have laid down for myself in the disposal of my time. Not that I should mind in the smallest <pb id="pg-03-48" n="03:48"/>disobliging these calling people by refusing to have any thing to say to them; I value their most vile voices not a straw&#x2014; But the mischief is, I cannot disoblige <hi rend="italic">them</hi> without running the risk of disobliging my Mother also; and domestic <hi rend="italic">accordance</hi> I find to be absolutely indispensible to that tranquil frame of mind which is proper for study&#x2014; To avoid those who are still in the practice of breaking in upon us before one oclock, I have excogitated an expedient for which I think I deserve some credit. While my Mother was colded we got into a way of breakfasting in her dressingroom, and finding that this arrangement, by which two pairs of stairs and a great many wooden doors are interposed between me and my enemies, contributed very considerably to my security, I managed to have it continued after my Mother got well again. I was still liable however to be sent for to the dining room, and must then either have complied or have irritated my Mother by a point blank refusal. The way I have fallen upon to avoid this inconvenience is the simplest that can well be imagined, and nevertheless it has hitherto proved effectual. When I get up in the morning I merely dash the sleep out of my eyes with cold water, comb up my hair and whip on my dressing-gown, taking care never to dress myself till after one oclock, As my Mother discovers no deeper motive in this proceeding than laziness or perhaps <hi rend="italic">economy</hi> she does not at all object to it&#x2014;and now&#x2014;observe&#x2014;when any one comes she knows well enough that I am not <hi rend="italic">fit to be seen</hi> and so does not make any attempt to produce me. My paper is almost filled, and I have still a great many things to say to you; but as my affection for you is great I cannot find in my heart to cross such writing as this and will keep them all till another opportunity. When shall I have more of Meister? I do not know yet what to think of it. I cannot seperate your interest in it from G&#xF6;ethes, or my own opinion of it from what is likely to be the opinion of the public. I wish however it had not been so <hi rend="italic">queer</hi>. My Mother sends her best regards. She was <hi rend="italic">highly pleased</hi> with your last letter. depend upon it my friend it is for the good of us both that she is admitted into our correspondence. So <hi rend="italic">remember</hi>! no <hi rend="italic">darlings</hi> or anything <hi rend="italic">of that nature in English</hi>; but never mind that, my heart supplies them for you w<supplied>[h]</supplied>erever they can be <hi rend="italic">crammed</hi> in. When will you write<supplied>[?]</supplied> on <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> at farthest&#x2014; <closer><salute>God bless you Ever</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>devotedly yours</salute></closer> <name>Jane Welsh</name>

<p>&#x2026; Since I last wrote I have proceeded pretty regularly with my translation, at the rate of ten pages daily, correcting the proof-sheets as we go along. &#x2026;</p>
<p>One material part of the affair I have already satisfactorily concluded; I mean the bargain with the Bookseller. &#x2026; He is to pay me down &#xa3;180 on the day of publication, and to make what hand he pleases of the 1000 copies he is printing. This is very handsome payment for my labour, however it may turn; and what I like best of all, it is dry hard cash, totally independent of risks. If the book sell the man will repay himself royally: and he deserves it for his risks. I too shall gain in that case, for after these 1000 copies are sold I am to have &#xa3;250 for every further 1000 he chances to print. So that it does not by any means seem improbable that within a year I may make &#xa3;500 more of it; but anyway I have the &#xa3;180, fair recompense for my labour, and I am satisfied. &#x2026;</p>
<p>I will likely be with you some time next week. &#x2026; Tell Mother that she must get the teapot overhauled and all the tackle put in order: I am going to stay a month, and mean to drink tea with her very diligently. &#x2026;</p>

<dateline><place>35 Bristo-Street</place>, Saturday. [<date when="1824-03-20">20 March 1824</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>In finishing Alick&#x2019;s letter, I did not think I should have any time to write you a single line: but on second thoughts, I have determined <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to send away the package without one single sentence for you; knowing that even a sentence from my hand will be more welcome to you than nothing.</p>
<p>I intended to answer your part of a letter, which I received at Kinnaird; but this is not the time for doing it. I expect at any rate ere long to see you, to sit and talk with you, and have tea together in <pb id="pg-03-50" n="03:50"/>the small <hi rend="italic">down the house</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210721-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, [<date when="1821-07-21"><hi rend="italic">ca</hi>. 21 July 1821</date></ref>].</note> at Mainhill, when we shall be able to talk this and a thousand other matters over at our leisure. I have never been half so well since I was there last time.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> will ere long be printed in London: I told you already that I had some thoughts of making it into a book. The book I am engaged with here is not my own but a translation from the German: it is purely a money speculation. If it do not prosper, I shall get nothing, and lose nothing but my pains; if it do prosper, it may bring me in several hundreds of pounds. Time will try it all.</p>
<p>My health is not bad, as health usually goes with me. I think two months of riding on Bardolph would almost set me up again. I design to lose no time that I can help in trying. If I wait till the book is done, it will be <date when="1824-04">April</date> at soonest ere I come: but if I take it into my head, I can come off in two weeks. I advise you therefore to get the little room in order, and the tea-tackle brushed up, and all things put ready lest I take you unawares.</p>
<p>Above all, My dear Mother, let me desire you to get well and keep well yourself. Two sickly people are bad company for one another. Are you well? I never get any special account whether your health is good or not; only that you are &#x201C;in the old way,&#x201D; which I know too well was not a very good way.&#x2014; Excuse my haste and incoherence; never was <supplied>[man]</supplied> so, hurried. You will hear from me again in a week or ten days after you read this: sooner, if I grow worse. <closer><salute>Good night, My dear Mother!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Bestes Liebchen</hi></foreign> [Dearest Little Sweetheart]!</salute> I know you will be expecting these sheets to-day, and I cannot think of disappointing you of any small enjoyment they can yield you. For the rest, you must excuse my haste and insufficiency in writing: I never was so hurried all the days of my life. I have taken out my seat in the Coach for Thursday morning, and they are determined to have done with the second volume ere I go; of which <hi rend="italic">thirty pages</hi> are still in German. Nevertheless I will have half an hour&#x2019;s talk with you, betide what may.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-51" n="03:51"/>Your letter was a precious thing for me. I wish you would adopt that close hand, and fill your sheet so well, and be so earnest and good-humoured and kind on all occasions. Rather I should ask of Fate to be so kind to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> on all occasions: I believe it was the air of happiness which breathes from this epistle that more than usually enlivened me. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> are always good, always bountiful in heart; your circumstances alone are liable to vary. For all this you deserve considerable <hi rend="italic">preferment</hi>; and shall have it yet, <foreign><hi rend="italic">mein Kind</hi></foreign>.</p>
<p>As to that &#x201C;unblessed&#x201D; day&#x2019;s work, what farther can be said about it? I do not think it possible for the &#x201C;mind of man&#x201D; entirely to forgive such a thing, within less than half a century. Yet I have very <hi rend="italic">nearly</hi> forgiven you &#x201C;even to the heart&#x2019;s core&#x201D;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly adapted from <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, ii.</note> we shall see what farther can be done when we <hi rend="italic">come to settle accounts</hi>. But remember your bill payable at sight! My own private idea is that you are a <hi rend="italic">witch;</hi> or like Sapphira in the New Testament, concerning whom D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Nimmo<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Masson writes in his <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Sketches and Memories</hi> (London and Edinburgh, <date when="1892">1892</date>), pp. 285 ff: &#x201C;Within my own memory, and in facts as late as <date when="1846">1846</date>, there was known about the precincts of Edinburgh University a singular being called <hi rend="small-caps">Peter Nimmo</hi>, or, by tradition of some jest played upon him, <hi rend="small-caps">Sir Peter Nimmo</hi>. He was a lank, miserable, mendicant-looking object, of unknown age, with a blue face, often scarred and patched, and garments not of the cleanest, the chief of which was a long, threadbare, snuff-brown great-coat. His craze was that of attending the University class-rooms and listening to the lectures. So long had this craze continued that a University session without &#x2018;Sir Peter Nimmo&#x2019; about the quadrangle, for the students to laugh at and perpetrate practical jokes upon, would have been an interruption of the established course of things; but, as his appearance in a class-room had become a horror to the Professors, and pity for him had passed into a sense that he was a nuisance and cause of disorder, steps had at last been taken to prevent his admission, or at least to reduce his presence about college to a minimum. They could not get rid of him entirely, for he had imbedded himself in the legends and the very history of the University. &#x2026; In certain reminiscences which the late Dr. Hill Burton wrote of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> first session at the University, viz. in <date when="1830">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831">31</date>, when he attended Wilson&#x2019;s Moral Philosophy Class, Peter is an important figure. &#x2026; I have traced him in the University records back and back long before Dr. Burton&#x2019;s knowledge of him, always paying his matriculation-fee and always taking out one or two classes. In the <hi rend="italic">Lapsus Linguae, or College Tatler</hi>, a small satirical magazine of the Edinburgh students for the session <date when="1823">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1824">24</date>, &#x2018;Dr. Peter Nimmo&#x2019; is the title of one of the articles, the matter consisting of clever imaginary extracts from the voluminous notebooks, scientific and philosophical, of this &#x2018;very sage man, whose abilities, though at present hid under a bushel, will soon blaze forth, and give a very different aspect to the state of literature in Scotland.&#x2019; In the session of <date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820">20</date>, when Carlyle was attending the Scots Law Class, Peter Nimmo was attending two of the medical classes, having entered himself in the matriculation book, in conspicuously large characters, as &#x2018;PETRUS BUCHANAN NIMMO, ESQUIRE, &#x26;c., DUMBARTONSHIRE,&#x2019; with the addition that he was in the 17th year of his theological studies. Six years previously, viz. in <date when="1813">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814">14</date>, he is registered as in the 8th year of his literary course. In <date when="1811">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1812">12</date> he was one of Carlyle&#x2019;s fellow-students in the 2d Mathematical Class under Leslie; and in <date when="1810">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811">11</date> he was with Carlyle in the 1st Mathematical Class and also in the Logic Class. &#x2026; He used to boast of his high family.&#x201D; See Carlyle&#x2019;s satirical poem &#x201C;Peter Nimmo: A Rhapsody,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, III (<date when="1831-02">Feb. 1831</date>), 12&#x2013;16, reprinted in Shepherd, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, I, 357&#x2013;67. Masson and J. A. S. Barrett believe that the <hi rend="italic">Lapsus Linguae</hi>, mentioned above (published <date when="1824-03-05">5 March 1824</date>), was also by Carlyle (see Dyer, p. 208). Cf. also Acts 5:1&#x2013;3.</note> once <pb id="pg-03-52" n="03:52"/>preached in my hearing: &#x201C;It seems probable, my friends, that Annanias was tempted unto this by some demon <hi rend="italic">more wicked than his wife</hi>.&#x201D; But these are things too high for me.</p>
<p>In seriousness, I am extremely glad to learn that you are getting on with some employment that improves you and keeps your conscience quiet. Walk forward in that steady manner; neither loitering nor overhasting yourself. Remember Ralpho&#x2019;s proverb given in Hudibras &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">slow fire does make sweet malt</hi>.<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hudibras says it, not his squire Ralpho (I, iii, <date when="1251">1251</date>&#x2013;<date when="1254">54</date>): &#x201C;Hold, hold, quoth <hi rend="italic">Hudibras, Soft fire</hi> / They say, <hi rend="italic">does make sweet Malt</hi>.

What a glorious correcting of it we shall have! I beg especially that you do not forget your two hours&#x2019; walking: headache I look upon as your most dangerous enemy, and not otherwise to be dislodged and defied. Tell me carefully how you go on with all this: I desiderate a multitude of details in your last letter, copious as it is. Do you ever see the little Doctor, and how fares he? This Lewins whom you talk of is a paltry character, as I have heard: it were natural for you to feel a spleen against him, even if he had never been concerned more nearly with you. Yet let him have his swing: a dog is but a dog, however much they fondle him and pat him; and will but pass for a dog at last. I should regret this burgh squabble if it seriously vexed you: but I suppose it only lends a little interest to what would otherwise be dull and indifferent, the doings and avoidings of your civic neighbours. What a pretty thing it would be to see little Fyffe fighting a duel with this unworthy practitioner! I figure him cholerick but concentrated, with one foot advanced, the brow racked up,&#x2014;&#x201C;stiffening the sinews, lending to the eye a horrible aspect&#x201D;&#x2014; Angels and ministers of grace defend us!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Henry V</hi>, III, i; <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, I, iv.</note> Yet after all Fyffe is a courageous little fellow; as such I respect him, and even almost love him.</p>
<p>Since I wrote last, there has been no change in my manner of existence; scarcely any incident in my history. I settled with Boyd in a <pb id="pg-03-53" n="03:53"/>style worthy of Yorkshire itself: he tried two plans to hoodwink me; very cunning ones; but they would not do. We had a little sharp discussion on the subject; and speedily agreed. Boyd is an open handed Bibliopolist: he is no niggard, nor do I reckon him a knave. He pays me down &#xa3;180 (the sum I asked) on the day of publication, and has the total property of these 1000 copies at present printing. If he sell them all he will be well remunerated; if he do not sell one of them it will be quite the same to me. For the second edition he gives me &#xa3;250 per 1000 copies, and after that the book is mine. I partly expect to make another &#xa3;500 of it: but any way, I am already paid sufficiently for all my labour. Am I a <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> still? I was intended for a <hi rend="italic">horsedealer</hi> rather.&#x2014; You will not like this second volume a jot better than you did the first: I only tell you to pause in your judgement till you have seen it all. There are two leaves wanting at the end of vol. I. but they contain nothing save a <hi rend="italic">kiss</hi> fro<supplied>[m]</supplied> the Countess to Wilhelm, who milksop as he was deserved no treat of that kind. It will keep me all April as busy as a turnspit. But I shall get better health at home, and with health there is no fear of me. Will you write every week, and be ready to pay me in May? If you do not, there is nothing but the horrors of a jail before you: I have it in black and white against you, and His Majesty&#x2019;s Justices of the Peace shall hear of it if you deny. Was ever poor young woman so beleaguered? Owes me <hi rend="italic">twelve shillings</hi> current money, and must pay it or be gazetted and imprisoned! I declare I feel some pity for you: but it cannot be helped. Will you write to Mainhill next sunday? I get home on Thursday-night.</p>
<p>I owe a little paragraph to the history of my friendship with the <hi rend="italic">Tiger</hi> and its consequences. Not seeing him, and needing his promised service, I wrote to Pierce, requesting information and mentioning the name of Dunlop.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Tiger Wull&#x201D; Dunlop and Robert Pierce Gillies. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240229-JBW-TC-01"><sic>TC to JBW</sic><corr>JBW to TC</corr>, <date when="1824-02-29">29 Feb.</date></ref></note> There arrived no shadow of an answer: and so the matter terminated! This is no heartbreaking business: life I believe, even without the aid of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Gillies, may still be carried on; and the information which he could have given me I have already got from other quarters. My letter I suppose was wrong worded; tho&#x2019; I have forgotten how it ran, I recollect that it was written one morning when I was very hurried and not too good-humoured or too healthy. Probably I would write to Pierce as to a man and a scholar; probably he is but a dandy and an Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Dilettante. This may be your answer to the <hi rend="italic">Tiger</hi> if he ever speak of it; if not, just let it rest. I love the <pb id="pg-03-54" n="03:54"/>jolly Tiger not a particle the worse for this neglect: even Pierce himself I love. I am growing a very <hi rend="italic">Irving</hi>, in love</p> 
<p>But the paper is done, and time is done, and your patience is done; so I must end. My kindest regards to your Mother; I hope she is completely well: has she not forgot that she is to be taxed with me in <date when="1824-05">May</date>?&#x2014; This letter is far too long: I will give but two pages next time. Will you write to me on Sunday. Farewell my dearest Enemy! Be <hi rend="italic">good</hi> till you see me, and then better. <closer><salute>I am ever your&#x2019;s</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearly Beloved</salute>
<p>I trust you have not been taking it into your head that any thing tragic is come to pass in our commonwealth: all is going on excellently well; only I have been pushed for time this day or two. I bear in mind what you told me of Frederick the Great, and am quite aware that this excuse for not writing to a friend looks immensely absurd; but it is God&#x2019;s truth nevertheless. On Sunday week I brought out my writing parap<supplied>[h]</supplied>ernalia with the best intentions in the world, and actually wrote a page of a letter to you; but I had been to church twice that day in honour of Grace (my Aunt),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her father&#x2019;s sister.</note> and had rode a great way the day before on a fractious horse, from the same courteous motive, and with all this I was so worn out that I fell asleep holding the pen, and like the foolish virgins in scripture slept away my opportunity.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 25:5.</note> Every day since, I have had to undergo a tea-party, an infliction which according to Haddington etiquette lasts three good hours. Now three hours, with half an hour more, which is little enough in all conscience, for the intricate operations of a young lady&#x2019;s toilet and two hours which I am obliged to walk that I may keep myself in good health and my young Aunt in good humour, make up all my spare time. The six hours which I have set apart for reading, I have said that nothing less than fate shall interfere with&#x2014;and heretofore I have kept my word&#x2014;</p>
<p>Have you finished the second volume of Meister and are you in life? I wish I had been in your place that week just that I might know <pb id="pg-03-55" n="03:55"/>what <hi rend="italic">driving</hi> would do for me. I suspect I should behave myself in such a breeze, much as a grown Lady of my acquaintance does, when the bells ring for church before she has finished dressing herself, lift up my voice and weep. I devoutly wish that you were done with this Meister. I like ill to see your fine <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> engaged in such a service &#x2014;one might as well set a mettled racer to draw in a dust cart. Do not think me an ass because I cannot swear allegiance to your &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">thrice illustrious Goethe</hi>&#x201D;: by and by, when my understanding gets more enlarged, it is to be hoped I shall admire him to your heart&#x2019;s content and think Wilhelm Meister worthy of such a translator&#x2014;but in the mean time, I confess, the only thing that reconciles me to your expending so much time and trouble on it, is the <hi rend="italic">money</hi> which it will bring you in. I would rather be able to make &#xa3;180 by my wits than fall heir to a million; it must be such a proud consciousness to know that one is independent of the favour of Fortune, that one carries at all times a gold mine within one&#x2019;s own breast! Do you think they will give me a hundred and eighty <hi rend="italic">pence</hi> for my tales?&#x2014; The unaccountable propensity to kissing which runs through all your dramatis personae perplexes me sadly. I wish people may not think <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a terrible fellow for having any hand in such work&#x2014; By the way, what is the reason that you kept back the countess&#x2019;s kiss?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>.</note> The prelude to it gives promise of something extremely pretty. I wish I had all of it. That poor little Child with St. Vitus&#x2019;-dance!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mignon in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>.</note> I cannot possibly imagine what is to become of her. So far she seems to play much the same part in the piece which the text does in the generality of sermons&#x2014;is perpetually recur<supplied>[r]</supplied>ing without having any visible connexion with what goes before or after. How long will it be, for God&#x2019;s sake, before she is done learning Geography? Do tell me her end will you? I have a notion she is to die of eating sticks&#x2014; Mother has made a nice binding of boards and white ribbonds for the loose sheets. I could not help kissing her for her ingenuity. She talks of you in the most friendly manner. I wish May was here that we might make hay while the sun shines!</p>
<p>I am not in quite such commodious circumstances as when I wrote last&#x2014;however my case is still far from desperate; only Grace is here, and I would much rather that she was any where else&#x2014; She is very illmannered and unamiable&#x2014;moreover she is mortally jealous of <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and cannot hear a word said to my praise, even by my Mother, without <pb id="pg-03-56" n="03:56"/>discovering the bitterest spite: all this makes her anything but a pleasant companion for me&#x2014; It is merciful that I am not obliged to <hi rend="italic">behave pretty</hi> to her. Mother lets me have a fire in my own room and sit there when I please&#x2014;so that her being here is no interruption to my <hi rend="italic">plan</hi> and for six hours in the day I am quit of her intolerable spleen and impertinence. Mother tells me that whenever I take myself off, to my place of refuge, she sets to work to rail against learned ladies and expatiate on the utter detestation which they are held in by the <hi rend="italic">gentlemen</hi>. God grant that her ignorance may recommend her to their good graces!</p>
<p>I am getting on with the Tales at a slow but regular rate&#x2014;what I have translated of the Legends of Rubezhal is certainly nothing like so heart breaking as my sublime Lybussa&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it is still far from what it should be&#x2014; That is a blessed secret you let into of the point of interrogation! whenever I come upon a passage that I cannot manage or word that is not in my Dictionary, instead of getting into a turmoil as I used to do, I merely set down the little crooked thing and comfort myself with he will tell it me when he comes&#x2014;when he comes! I am not <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> done with Charles<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Robertson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of Charles V</hi> (<date when="1769">1769</date>).</note> yet&#x2014;my memory is so bad that I require to learn a book of that sort almost by heart, that I may retain any part of it. What would you advise me to get next? and what shall I do with the volume I have of Schiller&#x2014; Oh that divine Maid of Orleans! if you would translate <hi rend="italic">that</hi> since you will not write a Tragedy of your own! I cried over it two whole days whenever I had an opportunity&#x2014; And made a solemn vow to the Name of Schiller that if you do not translate it I will myself&#x2014; as soon as ever I am <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> enough for such an enterprise&#x2014; you will write presently? I shall be very tired before this week is done, and will need some <hi rend="italic">encouragement</hi>&#x2014; I have two long forenoon rides and five evening parties <foreign><hi rend="italic">in prospectu</hi></foreign>. <closer><salute>God bless you my best and Dearest friend&#x2014;ever ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have sent you some 6 or 7 sheets of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, which I could wish to have printed as speedily as possible. To my mortification, I <pb id="pg-03-57" n="03:57"/>learned on inquiring at the Commercial Bank Office that a packet does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come everyweek <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, tho&#x2019; one goes every week to it. With very few exceptions, however, one comes down every <hi rend="italic">two</hi> weeks; so that I hope we shall still be able to something by means of it. In the present instance, the Banker tells me it is likely a packet will be setting out from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Tuesday week. You had better send to the Bank and make inquiries: and see if you can get me half a dozen sheets printed, and sent down on that occasion: I will correct them, immediately, and send them up by the end of the following week. Franks would do better: but I suppose they are not to be had.</p>
<p>If this parcel prosper, you will receive it on Monday night. Be so kind as send the other little note over to my Brother; whom it instructs to write and tell me whether the manuscript arrives safe.</p>
<closer><salute>I remain, in haste, / My dear Sir, / faithfully Your&#x2019;s /</salute></closer> <name>Th: Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>My address is: Mainhill, Ecclefechan (to be sent by the Com<supplied>[m]</supplied>ercial Bank Annan)</p>
<p>The Bank parcel does not go till Friday: so I preferred sending this by the Coach.</p></ps>

<p><salute>Dearest&#x2014;</salute> Had it not been that you and I so well deserved some &#x201C;encouragement&#x201D; by our late conduct, I should not have attempted writing to you at present. But we are both growing very exemplary characters, in my opinion; and it seems fair that this correspondence of ours, one of the most pleasant items in our lot, should not be allowed to stagnate in the general reformation. I meant to write last Sunday: but hail storms detained me at Annan, whither I had trotted down the previous evening, on some slender business; and next morning, sermons, civilities and especially native indolence so acted on me, that the day was altogether spent before I left that ancient burgh. I might have waited till next Sunday; but I have got into long trains of speculation about you; and I cannot rest at my business till I have written to you! So casting all my tasks to the right and left, I am here this fair and blessed morning with the full purpose of inflicting three close pages on you.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-58" n="03:58"/>I think this is the longest spell of study you ever had. I do congratulate you on your regularity, the quality which I hold to be the most essential of all others for realising any result in life. Of course I advise you not to relax; or rather I should advise you not to overstrain, for that is generally the source of your relaxing. The great point, as you well know, is constancy of moderate exertion: see that you do &#x201C;let nothing less than Fate interfere with you.&#x201D; Independently of future effects, the effect upon your present feelings must be sufficient to repay your diligence. There is no fame or rest for you, save in vigorous endeavour. &#x201C;The end of man is an action not a thought,&#x201D; saith Aristotle.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >C. F. Harrold says that this is a free adaptation from Aristotle, <hi rend="italic">Ethics</hi>, I, iii; X, ix, etc; and that it is closely related to Goethe&#x2019;s dictum &#x201C;Doubt of any kind can be removed by nothing but activity.&#x201D; See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 155 n., 196.</note> You have thought of literature from your very cradle: it is time you were trying to act in it, according to your power. Is R&#xfc;bezahl done? Spare not the little &#x201C;crook&#x201D;! We shall answer all his questions in the Ides of May. Have you done with Charles V? It is not at all bad work, if you can answer yes. I know not whether you have seen Robertson&#x2019;s History of America: if not try to get it, in preference to almost any other. Watson&#x2019;s two Histories of Philip II and Philip III you must also read as soon as possible: they form a very pleasing and instructive and amusing (tho&#x2019; also very shallow) continuation to Charles V. There is Millot&#x2019;s History of France;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Claude Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Xavier Millot (<date when="1726">1726</date>&#x2013;<date when="1785">85</date>), <hi rend="italic">&#xc9;lements de l&#x2019;histoire de Franc depuis Clovis jusqu&#x2019;&#xE0; Louis XV</hi> (<date when="1767">1767</date>&#x2013;<date when="1769">69</date>) or <hi rend="italic">Abr&#xE9;g&#xE9; de l&#x2019;histoire de Franc</hi> (<date when="1778">1778</date>).</note> Russel<supplied>[l]</supplied>&#x2019;s Modern Europe; Schiller&#x2019;s Thirty Years&#x2019; War (translated or in German); any of Voltaire&#x2019;s Historical works. Tell me which you have selected. The convenience of getting them must direct your choice: so you study them faithfully, it matters little in what order. Did you ever read De Foe&#x2019;s works? They deserve reading. I suppose you dare not think of recommencing Hume? Oh! no!</p>
<p>Is the unlearned lady gone? Mortals were surely made for being happy: Vanity is cheap as air, yet it diffuses joy thro&#x2019; all the corner of creation. Be tolerant to Grace while she is with you: she must have some good qualities, or I am no physiognomist. Her face always reminded me of yours; enlarged and rusticated, with Scotch <foreign><hi rend="italic">sonsines</hi></foreign> [cheerfulness and healthy good looks] instead of dignified refinement It is pity she were envious: but this is so general a failing that on ought not to condemn her for it utterly. Be good to her for your own sake. In time, I expect to see you altogether catholic in your sentiments <pb id="pg-03-59" n="03:59"/>towards others. There is nothing like it, in the present state of affairs. Do you like this counsel? I myself am so immeasurably patient of dulness and contradiction, that I have a right to advise it upon all the earth.</p>
<p>So you laugh at my venerated Goethe and my <foreign><hi rend="italic">Herzenskind</hi></foreign> [heart&#x2019;s child] poor little wood-eating Mignon! O! The hardness of man&#x2019;s and still more of woman&#x2019;s heart! If you were not lost to all true feeling, now, your eyes would be as a fountain of tears in the perusing of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>. Have you really no pity for the Hero, or the Count, or the Frau Melina, or Philine, or the Manager? Well! it cannot be helped. I must not quarrel with you, do what you like; but taken on the whole, a more provoking young woman is not to be met with, I am sure, between Cape Wrath and Kirk-Maiden.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cape Wrath is a promontory at the extreme NW of Scotland. See map. Kirkmaiden is in SW Wigtonshire. Being the southernmost point, it is mentioned, in company with John o&#x2019; Groat&#x2019;s House, in Burns&#x2019;s phrase &#x201C;Frae Maiden Kirk to John o&#x2019; Groats.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220100-JBW-EA-01">JBW to <sic>ES</sic><corr>EA</corr>, <sic><date when="1821-12">Dec. 1821</date></sic><corr>[<date when="1822-01">Jan. 1822</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> Will you not cry in the least? Not a jot! Not a jot!&#x2014;&#x2014; Seriously you are right about this book, it is worth next to nothing as a novel; except <hi rend="italic">Mignon</hi> who <hi rend="italic">will</hi> touch you yet perhaps, there is no person in it one has any care about. But for its wisdom, its eloquence, its wit; and even for its folly, and its dullness, it interests me much; far more the second time than it did the first. I have not got as many ideas from any book for six years. You will like Goethe better ten years hence than you do at present. It is pity the man were not known among us. The English have begun to speak about him of late years; but no light has yet been thrown upon him, &#x201C;no light but only darkness visible.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, I, 63.</note> The syllables <hi rend="italic">Goethe</hi> excite an idea as vague and monstrous as the word <hi rend="italic">Gorgon</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Chimaera</hi>.&#x2014; It would do you good to see with what regularity I progress in translating. Clockwork is scarcely steadier. Nothing do I allow to interfere with me; my movements might be almost calculated like the moon&#x2019;s. It is not unpleasant work, nor is it pleasant. Original composition is ten times as laborious. It is an agitating, fiery, consuming business when your heart is in it: I can easily conceive a man writing the soul out of him; writing till it evaporate &#x201C;like the snuff of a farthing candle,&#x201D; when the matter interests him properly. I always recoil from again engaging with it. But this present business is cool and quiet; one feels over it, as a shoemaker does when he sees the leather gathering into a shoe; as any mortal does when he sees the activity of his mind expressing itself in some external material shape. You are facetious <supplied>[about]</supplied> my mine of <pb id="pg-03-60" n="03:60"/>gold: it has often struck me as the most accursed item in men&#x2019;s lot that they had to toil for filthy lucre; but I am not sure now that it is not the <hi rend="italic">ill-best</hi> way it could have been arranged. Me it would make happy, at least for half a year, if I saw the certain prospect before me of making &#xa3;500 per annum: a pampered Lord (e.g. Byron) would turn with loathing from a pyramid of ingots. I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be blessed in this way: he never. Let us be content! When I get that weary <hi rend="italic">Cottage</hi> erected, and all things put in order, who knows but it may be well with me, after all? Will <hi rend="italic">you</hi> go? Will you? &#x201C;Not a hairs breadth!&#x201D; Well, it is very cruel of you.</p>
<p>It would edify you much to see my way of life here; how I write and ride, and delve in the <hi rend="italic">garth</hi>, and muse on things new and old. On the whole I am moderately happy. There is rough substantial plenty here: for me there is heartfelt kindness in the heart of every living thing, from the cur that vaults like a kangaroo whenever he perceives me, and the pony that prances when he gets me on his back, up to the sovereign heads of the establishment. &#x201C;Better is a dinner of herbs with peace, than a stalled ox and contention.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 15:17.</note> Better is affection in the smoke of a turf cottage, than indifference amid the tapestries of palaces! I am often very calm and quiet. I delight to see these old mountains, lying in the clear sleep of twilight, stirless as death, pure as disembodied spirits; or floating like cerulean islands while the white vapours of the morning have hidden all the lower earth. They are my own mountains! Skiddaw and Helvellyn, with their snowy cowls, among their thousand azure brethren, are more to me than St Gothard and Mont Blanc: Hartfell and Whitecomb raise their bald and everlasting heads into my native sky; and far beyond them, as I often picture, in their bright home, are Jane and her Mother, sometimes thinking of me, cheering this dull earth for me with a distant spot of life and kindliness!&#x2014; Bless me! the sweet youth is growing quite poetical! <foreign><hi rend="italic">C&#x2019;est assez</hi></foreign> [Enough]!</p>
<p>So I have played truant all the morning writing to you! When will you answer me? Do you recollect your debt? The day is coming! I am</p>
<closer><salute>Thy evil Genius, /</salute></closer> <name>Th: Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>Make my kindest compliments to your Mother: it is very good of her to speak of me at all&#x2014; Schiller you may send to John. 35. Bristo-street. Has he written for it? He will get you any other you may desire. <foreign>Adieu!</foreign> Soon!</p></ps>

<salute>My sweetest Coz</salute>
<p>I have been meaning to write to thee for these last three weeks&#x2014; but &#x201C;man proposeth and God disposeth&#x201D;!&#x2014;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas &#xE0; Kempis, <hi rend="italic">Imitation of Christ</hi>, I, xix.</note> I do not know how it is, for all such a miser as I am, as to the article of time, I have very seldom an hour to spare. I am busy just now translating German&#x2014;as busy as if my fortune in this world, and my salvation in that which is to come, depended on my proficiency in that enchanting tongue. And then there has been Miss Grace here for a whole month, and she needs the entertainment of walks and tea parties. At the first she was quite intolerable with her fine-Lady airs, and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">toploftical</hi>&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Highflown.</note> notions. She thought (I suppose) that she was to carry it over me with as high a hand <hi rend="italic">here</hi> as she had done at Penfillan, but I was not just in the humour to let her&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">my foot is on my native heath and my name is McGregor</hi>!&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Rob Roy</hi>, chap. xxxiv.</note> <hi rend="italic">Here</hi> no one shall play <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Miss Welsh but <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. She decamps tomorrow&#x2014; Praise be to God in the highest! for I am &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">sick of imitating Job</hi>&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230718-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-07-18">18 July 1823</date></ref>.</note> for this bout. We have had Miss Macmillan<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently the &#x201C;little skipping Lady that made a progress with us along the Bridges&#x201D; in Edinburgh, mentioned in <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240429-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1824-04-29">29 April</date></ref>.</note> too for ten days, and her Brother for two, both of them right worthy persons in their way; whom one does not grudge to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">behave pretty</hi>&#x201D; to.</p>
<p>Speaking of pretty behaviour&#x2014;you may tell M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Tiger<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her cousin &#x201C;Tiger Wull,&#x201D; Tiger Will, William Dunlop.</note> that I think <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has behaved very ugly indeed. What was the use of making such a hub-bub about my friend&#x2019;s address unless he meant to call for him? Moray street is neither a habitation in the Moon nor in the centre of the earth. As far as my Geography helps me, it is a new street half way down Leith walk&#x2014;but it is no matter now where it is! M<hi rend="italic">r Thomas</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle.</note> has been in the country this month back&#x2014;and the information which he wished to obtain from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Gillies, by means of the Tiger&#x2019;s introduction he has long ago gotten from another quarter.</p>
<p>I have had a horrible fright with Mother. She was taken last <pb id="pg-03-62" n="03:62"/>Monday with a violent pain in her head, and retching. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Howden<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Howden, surgeon, who had been Dr. Welsh&#x2019;s partner.</note> bled her employed all sorts of vigorous remedies&#x2014;but in spite of every thing that was done she remained for more than three hours in a state of agony that I never saw the like of. Since then she has had no return of violent illness but she is still plagued with headach<supplied>[e]</supplied> and sickness at times&#x2014; However as it is visibly bile that is at the bottom of all the mischief&#x2014; I expect with the help of a few <hi rend="italic">abominations</hi> to have her quite put to rights in a day or two.</p>
<p>I need not say how happy we were to here of your <supplied>[u]</supplied>ncles amendment. Is it not very odd that sensible man as he is he cannot take care of himself? You never quit him that he is not laid up. As a little Dunlop said of her Father once when he had put them all in a panic by staying late out &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">If ony body wud had</hi> [hold] <hi rend="italic">his hands I sould <foreign>cuff his lugs to him</foreign></hi> [box his ears].&#x201D;&#x2014; In the mean time you may give him a kiss&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have run against the little gunpowder man of Medicine,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Fyffe.</note> in the entry, several times. We &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">moue</hi></foreign>&#x2019; to<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grimace at.</note> one another&#x2014; I toss my head toploftically&#x2014;he looks as if he could eat me&#x2014; And that is all! A week or two after we came from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> he tried another fit of illness&#x2014;but it did nothing for him&#x2014; And as we neither sent to enquire for him nor testified simpathy for him in any way <hi rend="italic">his sins were very soon for</hi>given him<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 9:5.</note>&#x2014; that is to say after having kept his bed for a week&#x2014;one day dabbling with leeches and the next plashing in warm water&#x2014;he all at once rose up in good health&#x2014;dressed himself and drove* to town to be present at an operation performed on his Uncle, Not the musical Genius of St Giles Steeple&#x2014;but a fat old gentleman who has a fine house with a &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Hall</hi>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">saloons</hi>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">grounds</hi>&#x2019; about it in the vicinity of Moffat. Now when he perceives that he may bleed or boil himself to the day of Pentecost without interesting this &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">hard and stony heart</hi>&#x201D; of mine in the least in his favour&#x2014;he is adopting another mode of attack&#x2014;instead of <hi rend="italic">shaving his whiskers</hi> and using all possible expedients to give him the aspect of a woebegone man he is now trying to dazzle my wits with a white hat, silver headed Jockey whip and bits of <hi rend="italic">leg<supplied>[g]</supplied>ings</hi> of so bright a yellow that it does me ill to look at them. but <foreign>c&#x2019;est assez</foreign> [enough]!</p>

<salute>My beloved Brother</salute>
<p>The Devil has interefered with me! At the time that you was writing commendations on my diligence I had been idle for near a fortnight. You remember the little skip<supplied>[p]</supplied>ing Lady<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Miss Macmillan.</note> that mad<supplied>[e]</supplied> a progress with us along the Bridges, at the most eminent bodily risk? She has been here with us, on a visit; and as my Mother was far from well at the time, the whole burden of entertaining her and my <hi rend="italic">engagingly unlettered</hi> Aunt devolved upon me. This fresh interruption had so discomposed and disspirited me, that when the coast was clear again, I felt more in a humour to regret the many days so lost, than to make myself amends by redoubled industry. But your letter set all to rights again, and made me so very impatient to resume my plan that I could scarcely wait out the Lord&#x2019;s day on which it reached me. This is not the first time that your words have worked a beneficial revolution in <pb id="pg-03-64" n="03:64"/>my frame of mind: many is the time that they have roused me out of listlessness and dejection, (when nothing else could) into ardour, activity, and hope. Oh what I owe you! beside the dozen kisses&#x2014;(<foreign>pour parenth&#xE9;se</foreign>) will you talk no more of this same debt of mine&#x2014;at least till we meet. The fancy of charging twelve shillings for an inch of rubber passed at first for a witty joke; but my Mother will, for a certainty, think us ill off for smart conceits if you continue recurring to this one in every letter)&#x2014;</p>
<p>For these last ten days I have been getting on again in good style. I have finished Charles and am in the second volume of the History of America. At this rate I calculate on getting through with all the books which you recommend to me in about twenty years. If the Diety [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of Spurzheim<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Kaspar Spurzheim, the phrenologist.

I am obliged to get almost the whole of what I read by heart, that I may remember any part of it. As for Rubezahl (to my shame be it spoken) I am still in the fifth Legend&#x2014;however I might have been done with his Gnomeship long ago, if I had spent all my four <hi rend="italic">German hours</hi> on him. but I though<supplied>[t]</supplied> it more adviseable to devote half that time to reading the rest of the tales&#x2014;and then it takes me near as long to scribble a page as to translate one. in fact I am slow&#x2014;snailishly slow at every thing. But the Lord&#x2019;s will be done!</p>
<p>When will you be here? I long for your coming <hi rend="italic">this time</hi> for I think we shall be very happy, that is, providing D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Thumb does not shoot you dead. I have run against him several times of late. We pass each other with a haughty recognition. Oh it is great to see the little man on these occasions, the face of him looking defiance, as he raises his hand to his hat&#x2014;his white hat&#x2014;and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">struts a straw breadth nearer to the skies</hi>&#x201D;! I shall certainly laugh in his face some day or other. After my return from Edinburgh he tried me with another fit of illness. but we just let him be doing, and when he saw that all his bleeding and boiling of himself was like to go for nothing he all at once arose in excellent health took a drive to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and bought himself a white hat! At present he is exhibiting curious metamorp<supplied>[h]</supplied>oses to the speculative people in this quarter. From a slovenly muffled-up, snail-paced little man, he is become the sprucest flourish of a creature that you could wish <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to see. and what is truly astonishing this transformation took place in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> day. If you only saw his yellow knee-caps!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-65" n="03:65"/>Not a word from the Orator! So, my magnificent <foreign>chateau en Espagne</foreign> is completely demolished!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have looked over these Proofs, and along with them I send you the remainder of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>.

Here is <hi rend="italic">copy</hi> in abundance, and the coach affords a sure &#x26; ready conveyance.</p>

<p><salute>Dearest&#x2014;</salute>do you think I have forgotten you? You were never farther wrong in your life. In various humours grave and joyful, I have thought of you of late, with due assiduity, and as I think very orthodoxly. In proof of this you should have had a long epistle ere now; <pb id="pg-03-66" n="03:66"/>but Fate and Oliver &#x26; Boyd are stronger than my resolutions, and I am forced to content myself with a brief and hurried scrawl, which I write on the faith of its being better to you than absolutely nothing, this however being all that I dare believe respecting it.</p>
<p>About ten days ago, three days after I received your &#x201C;good little&#x201D; letter, I finished the translation of the everlasting <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>. The next week I proposed to spend in visiting the few friends whom I have in this neighbourhood, that I might enjoy myself among them, void of care, for a day or two, before leaving poor old Annandale. But scarcely had I executed the fourth part even of this very slender purpose, when the wind thought proper to shift into the northeast, and bring me a villainous sore throat, which kept me gasping and gargling in the house, till the day before yesterday. And now that my holidays have been so pleasingly put by, the preface for that unhappy novel is to be written, I am to make arrangements for departure, to ride and run and write, so that if I had twenty hands and heads they would all be sufficiently employed. Pity that one cannot arrange his business better! Few except the indolent are ever hurried.</p>
<p>But however I get thro&#x2019; all this, I am to be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Tuesday afternoon. If you would have the charity to send me a line to No 1. Moray-street, it would find me there. I am to be a very very short time in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; Meister is all printed but five sheets; and my business in Athens may very soon be transacted. Within its learned walls, I have not one single friend, not even an acquaintance that I value; which after fifteen years residence says but little for my moral qualities. In truth I care not tho&#x2019; the intellectual smoke of Athens never more salute my nostrils. But I shall see Haddington, shall I not? I hope to spend a <hi rend="italic">day in peace</hi> with you: I would spend all my days beside you, if it suited. Write about this; and when and how; if it suits your Mother&#x2019;s convenience, and whether she continues <hi rend="italic">good</hi> to me. Alack! I am sad when I think of leaving you. Scotland contains two million hearts; except those which nature gave me, yours is the only one of them, where I have any abiding place. Do you mean to oust me in the end? To raise a process of ejectment against me? I swear, you must not; it will never do!</p>
<p>You are in a passion at the Orator, and well he merits pity and anger for his conduct to you. There is something very weak in having one&#x2019;s head turned by a run of vacant fashionable canaille assembling to hear sermon<supplied>[s]</supplied>. Irving should really bethink him that tho&#x2019; the Hatton Garden Chapel is fuller than it ever was, nay though William <pb id="pg-03-67" n="03:67"/>Hone<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1780">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842">1842</date>), English radical satirist and bookdealer whose political satires were illustrated by George Cruikshank. Once prosecuted for sedition and blasphemy, he had turned from politics to religion.</note> sits in the front of his gallery, a monument of saving grace, and Lady Jersey,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Jersey; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230701-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-07-01">1 July 1823</date></ref>.</note> the hack of a thousand routs,&#x2014;still the Earth at large, and the other planets of the solar system are turning on their axes with no perceptible variation. Men still live and die, they marry and are given in marriage, love those that love them, forget those that forget them, hate those that hate them, and subsist on meat and drink, as they did before Judgement to Come had been handled by its last Expositor.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving.</note> I declare sometimes when he comes into my head, I feel more splenetic against him than he deserves. For withal there is a fund of goodness in the man&#x2019;s heart, as of real talent in his head; tho&#x2019; both are overclouded with a thousand blemishes and extravagancies. I firmly believe that at this moment he loves you with a more solid affection than ninety-nine hundredths of the people who are called friends bear to one another. That is he respects you, is pleased with the image of you, and <hi rend="italic">your gratitude is of high value to him</hi>. Be tolerant if you can; do not cast him off forever, till you see how he turns. The fumes of this sweet wine, which he has been drinking by the barrel, have flown to his head; they might have turned a stronger head than his. He has ceased to write, from affectation, haste, and above all indolence: and <hi rend="italic">none</hi> of his friends can say they are better off in this respect than others. He scarcely even writes to his mother. Charity may exist, says Gibbon, without alms; friendship without expression of it by letters. I sent him a letter, by appointment, before leaving Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>: it was if I recollect in the smoothflowing <foreign><hi rend="italic">pococurante</hi></foreign> [nonchalant] vein which one adopts in such cases. He answered me after five weeks in a letter containing about ten sentences. A third of it is devoted to you. After inviting me very cordially to stay in his house, while in London, and telling me that they are &#x201C;in the transit from one house to another, living now with one friend now with another,&#x201D; he adds &#x201C;this is the reason I have not written to Mrs Welsh and my dear pupil, that I have not had it in <supplied>[my]</supplied> power to second the invitation which I gave her to come up, and <supplied>[fear I shall not]</supplied> have this season. For though we be in a condition to receive <supplied>[a gentleman]</supplied> and one so dear to us and so simple in all his habits, we are not in a condition to receive a lady. But towards her, able or not able to show it, I must ever bear a brother&#x2019;s heart, and something more, as being <pb id="pg-03-68" n="03:68"/>her teacher and her friend and the friend of the family.&#x201D; Be content with this touch of the pathetic! It is good enough for every day wear; and Irving was not made for being a Pylades or an Orestes.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the celebrated friendships of literature is that between Orestes and Pylades.</note>&#x2014; But why am I scribble scribbling about him? He is <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the nine hundred millions of human bipeds that inhabit this planet: he has his own fight to fight; and so have <hi rend="italic">we</hi>; if he choose to stand by us, well; if not, there will be dry eyes when he departs. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ohe jam satis</hi></foreign> [Quite enough of this for the present]!</p>
<p>Poor Byron! Alas poor Byron! The news of his death<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1824-04-19">19 April</date>.</note> came down upon my heart like a mass of lead; and yet, the thought of it sends a painful twinge thro&#x2019; all my being, as if I had lost a brother! O God! That so many souls of mud and clay should fill up their base existence to its utmost bound, and this, the noblest spirit in Europe, should sink before half his course was run! Late so full of fire, and generous passion, and proud purposes, and now forever dumb and cold! Poor Byron! And but a young man; still struggling amid the perplexities, and sorrows and aberrations, of a mind not arrived at maturity or settled in its proper place in life. Had he been spared to the age of three score and ten, what might he not have done, what might he not have been! But we shall hear his voice no more: I dreamed of seeing him and knowing him; but the curtain of everlasting night has hid him from our eyes. We shall go to him, he shall not return to us.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 Sam. 12:23.</note> <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my dear Jane! There is a blank in your heart, and a blank in mine, since this man passed away. Let us stand the closer by each other!</p>
<closer><salute>I am yours forever</salute></closer>
<name>Th: Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Make my kindest compliments to your Mother. Is she recovered? Both you and she should be careful: surely it is a miserable season for health. Skiddaw and Helvellyn this morning are white as swans. The cattle are perishing on their burnt and shrivelled pastures, the very men at Ecclefechan fair seemed shrunk and parched and <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign>.</p>
<p>Will you write on Tuesday: I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> see you, if possible. Is Rubezahl done? Are your strangers gone? I long to hear of you, still more to see you.</p></ps>

<p>In the name of heaven why don&#x2019;t you write to me? I have waited day after day in the utmost impatience; and hope defer<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed has not only made my heart sick,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 13:12.</note> but is like to drive me out of my judgement.</p>
<p>For God sake write the instant this reaches you, if you have not done it before: I shall learn no lesson, settle to no occupation till I have your letter. Wretch! you cannot conceive what anxiety I am in about you. One moment I imagine you ill or in trouble of some sort, the next tired of me, the next something else as bad; in short there is no end to my imaginings.</p>
<p>I do not think that in the whole course of our correspondence so long an interval has ever elapsed before&#x2014;never but when we quarreled and this time there is no quarrel! To add to my perplexities there have I had a letter from that stupendous ass the Orator telling me such nonsensical things, and among the rest, that he is full of joy because Thomas Carlyle is to be with him this month! Can he mean you? this month! and twenty days of it are already past and gone! The man must have been delirious when he wrote such an impossible story. You can never, never mean to be in London this month! You promised to be here before you went, in words that it would be impiety to doubt<supplied>[.]</supplied> I have looked forward to your coming for weeks: You cannot dream of disappointing me!</p>
<p>What I would give to be assured this moment that excessive occupation is the sole cause of your present neglectfulness that devils are dunning you for the rest of your book, and that you are merely giving yourself all to Meister just now that you may the sooner be all for me. Is it not hard? this is the only comfortable conjecture I can form to explain your silence and yet I can never believe in it for more than a minute at a time&#x2014; Were I but certain that all is really well what a devil of a rage I would be in with you<supplied>[.]</supplied> Write Write&#x2014; I will tell you about <hi rend="italic">my visit to London then</hi>&#x2014; I have no heart for it now&#x2014; What an idiot I was ever to think that man so estimable&#x2014; but I am done with his Preachership now &#x26; for ever&#x2014;</p>
<p>And Byron is dead! I was told it all at once in a room full of people, My God if they had said that the sun or the moon was gone out of the heavens it could not have struck me with the idea of a more awful <pb id="pg-03-70" n="03:70"/>and dreary blank in the creation than the words Byron is dead<supplied>[.]</supplied> I have felt quite cold and dejected ever since<supplied>[.]</supplied> All my thoughts have been fearful and dismal&#x2014; I wish you was come.</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="italic">Angel!</hi></salute> I never knew till now that you were such an adept in the art of scolding. You are in truth a charming scold; I could like to be so rated twenty times a day. How delicious it is to put you into such a glorious humour! But I will not trespass again, if I can help it; for I have still a small spark of love for you in my heart, and I would not make you unhappy whatever I might gain by it. I design to love you through the whole of this summer at any rate.</p>
<p>Last night I wrote you such a letter as you never read; the strangest mixture of enthusiasm and ridicule, and love and theology, and misery and rapture; such a thing as I could often write after two sleepless nights and harassed days, and as would keep you laughing for a month to come. But for this time my better genius had the upper hand; I burnt the sheet this morning, it having been too late for the post last night; and you, mistress, shall never know a jot of the matter&#x2014;at least of the sublime parts of it. Thus much only I will tell you: it promised that I<supplied>[,]</supplied> though very sick and jaded and stupid, would come to see you on Friday evening; a promise which I here from the heart confirm. Your Mother is very good; she will take me for a patient, if I cannot be a useful or amusing friend. &#x201C;Brethren I lack strength,&#x201D; as the Orator said in his late four-hours sermon. But what can I do? I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> see you if the life be in me: and will too whatever come of it.</p>
<p>Do, my <foreign>bonny lassie</foreign>, get done with your R&#xfc;bezahl before I come, if you can; if not we will finish it together. And oh! such a harrowing as I will give it! I will be luculent as Nox, severe as Rhadamanthus. I will teach you what it is to jest with edge-tools.</p>

<p>Whether Schiller is printed and come I cannot tell.

<salute>My dear Johnstone,</salute>
<p>Your letter was lying for me at the office of Messrs Oliver &#x26; Boyd when I returned from Annandale, last tuesday night. The newspapers, you must understand, for which you thanked me so cordially, were all transmitted from Mainhill, where I resided from the beginning of April, till the day above mentioned. Had my occupation been less incessant, I should undoubtedly have broken your repose and assisted by my suggestions the &#x201C;compunctious visitings&#x201D; of your own not yet altogether seared conscience. But alas! Goethe and <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> kept me busy as a cock upon the spit: it was not till yesterday that I got liberty to leave Edinburgh, and throw that wretched novel off my hands forever and a day. I am here spending with a kind &#x26; worthy family, <pb id="pg-03-73" n="03:73"/>a brief space of rest before setting off for London and Cornwall. You too are going to Vannes in Brittany! What strange shiftings to and fro in the monstrous whirligig of life!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night</hi>, V, i.</note> And are we to go without once having met? Old friends to part for we know not how long, and take no farewell? My dear James I cannot bear to think of it; and I write at present for the purpose of preventing it. This letter reaches you on Monday morning; I sail next Saturday by the steam-boat: could not you contrive to make a start for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and meet me there about Wednesday-night, and stay with me the next two days? Or which would be better could not you come out hither? I would show you Gilbert Burns,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brother of the poet, influential citizen of Haddington, and friend of the Welshes, whom Carlyle was visiting. He would later help James Johnston to get a teaching position in Haddington.</note> little Brown<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Brown. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18121119-JBW-MWE-01">JBW to <sic>MW</sic><corr>MWE</corr>, <date when="1812-11-19">19 Nov. 1812</date></ref>.</note> the schoolmaster (now married to Margaret Farries) and the people I am staying with, who could not fail to please you. Whichever way you like, only do if possible do one of them. Consider how often I have been at Broughty-ferry! I would have gone again in all probability had I had time. Besides you will see the General Assembly in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and Murray &#x26;c &#x26;c; and I will give you a copy of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> with you in your pocket, if you have a packet large enough to hold three volumes 8vo.</p>
<p>In short you must really make an effort: tell the General<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >General Mackenzie of Broughty Ferry.</note> you have not been a day from home since your arrival; and that in very truth he must give you leave. Write at any rate on Monday-night, the letter will not fail to find me here on Wednesday morning; on which morning if you also should embark from Dundee we might meet in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at night. My place there is Moray-street No. 1. Pattison&#x2019;s lodgings; and if they had not room for you, by walking up to Bristo street No. 35. Mrs Robertson (with whom you &#x26; I once staid a day or two) would if you mentioned my name to her most cheerfully admit you to any of her rooms, for all of them are vacant. Now think of this. At all events write to me directly; On monday, or at the very farthest on tuesday night, for in the latter case I should not receive the letter till Thursday-morning when I should be preparing to depart. A post later, nay two posts would still have a chance to find me at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; but in place of them, I hope to find yourself.</p>
<p>I write this in the hurry of an hour after dinner in momentary expectation of the post. You see the purport of it, and will pardon <pb id="pg-03-74" n="03:74"/>blunders. My address here is: To the Care of Mrs Welsh, Haddington. Write, and come quickly, and believe me always</p>
<closer><salute>My dear Johnstone, / Your sincere old friend, /</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>P<supplied>[.S.:]</supplied> If what I have said above, about your coming, th<supplied>[reatens]</supplied> to interfere with your professional arrangements, consider it as unsaid, and do not come <hi rend="italic">to hurt yourself</hi>. Let me know on Wednesday morning what you mean to do. You see how I wish it, and how the matter stands. <foreign>Adieu!</foreign> The post-hour is about sounding.</p></ps>

<p>I find it will not be possible for me to be in Edinburgh till Thursday; and accordingly I must put you you [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to the expence of a letter on the subject of these <hi rend="italic">Author&#x2019;s Copies.

Other <hi rend="italic">two</hi> you will oblige me by sending out hither, directed to Mrs Welsh, Haddington: I hope to receive them to-morrow; there are coaches at 9, at 3, at 4 o&#x2019;clock. The remaining <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> you can leave among your own, till I call on Thursday-night, and relieve you.

<salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
<p>This is a book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A copy of Carlyle&#x2019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi>, just off the press. &#x201C;Mr. Grahame,&#x201D; for whom the book was intended, was William Graham.

<p><pb id="pg-03-75" n="03:75"/>He desired me to forward it to you at Glasgow, who he said would immediately transmit it after him. He was anxious to have it with him on the voyage, but this I suppose is impossible.</p>
<p>You have an account against me <hi rend="italic">for tobacco</hi> in your books, which I am very sorry I have never yet got paid. If you could inform me of any method to send it over, I would send it with thanks; for it was a favour in the hour of need by which I contracted it. Some time or other I shall certainly pay you.</p>
<p>I am just on my way to London in a monstrous hurry; so I cannot tell you anything at present.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This sentence and Carlyle&#x2019;s address at the head of the letter help to date it.</note> I am to be there some time; if you would send your Glasgow news to me to the care of the Orator (who will know my address), I would not fail to answer you in due time.</p>

<p>I am in the most tremendous hurry but I snatch a moment to send my dearest another farewell. I need not say if I was sad on Thursday to leave you; I have not had a merry hour since then. The image of our walks and conversations, of all that we said and did together is present to my mind with a painful distinctness: I am like a man fallen from the third Heaven down among the meanness of vulgar Earth. Nothing but the hope that our meeting will be early and happy, and that at length we shall meet to part no more forever could make my present situation tolerable. Be true to me and to yourself, my <foreign><hi rend="italic">Herzens Liebling</hi></foreign> [heart&#x2019;s darling], and it will all be well! Our fate <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be more enviable than that of millions: God grant we be not disappointed!</p>
<p>The Steam-boat did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sail to-day; had it not been for the sake of common discretion I would have come back to you and staid till Tuesday-night. As it is I am sick of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>: my friends are all away; my business is all done; and a fine smack sails to-night at seven&#x2014;with nothing but Sir Something and two ladies in the cabin. So I depart in <pb id="pg-03-76" n="03:76"/>preference to waiting till Wednesday. About this day week, I expect to be in London. A letter from Buller was waiting for me: they are not going to leave town for I know not how long. The boys and I are to have lodgings some where in the vicinity, as they propose; and it seems possible enough that I may not visit Looe<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The family seat of the Bullers in Cornwall.</note> at all. This you will be glad to hear as I am. The moment I am settled, my own dear <foreign>lassie</foreign> shall hear from me. I have a letter for Thomas Campbell<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1777">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844">1844</date>), Scottish poet and journalist. At this time he was editing the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi>, which he edited from <date when="1820">1820</date> to <date when="1830">1830</date>.</note> from Brewster, and for various <hi rend="italic">Savan</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">t</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">s</hi><supplied>[.]</supplied> I will tell you about them in due time.</p>
<p>Here is a Shakspeare, which I only fear will hurt your eyes. If so let it lie upon the drawing-room table, and tell me that you are not reading it. Another copy may easily be had, and I could wish you to read it. You are to read Milton also, when you see good; and the histories regularly. I forgot to mention the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review, which I have often mentioned already. Your <hi rend="italic">second</hi> duty will be performed strictly for my sake. Your <hi rend="italic">third</hi> is the most important of any: love me every day better, as I shall assuredly love you.</p>
<p>For your Mother I need not beg of you to be attentive and daughterlike towards her. She and I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> yet be better acquainted. It is nothing but a fineness of feeling, which should make us both dearer to each other, that prevents us from already enjoying all the pleasures of an intercourse as frank and cordial as ours will yet be. Assure her of my highest respect and gratitude.</p>
<p>An<supplied>[d]</supplied> now my love I must part with you. Much, much of the happiness of my existence depends upon you: but I know in whom I have confided. With a thousand faults in both of us, there is no particle of baseness in the heart of either. <foreign>Adieu!</foreign> I press you to my bosom, and pray that God may keep for me, what is more to me than all things else. <closer><salute>Farewell my Dearest! I am ever your own,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I am within an hour of sailing for London, and as it is likely to be longer than I anticipated before you hear of me, I scribble you a few lines in the greatest possible hurry to let you know that it is well with me, and that you must not be uneasy till you hear from me.</p>
<p>I was not more hurt by my journey hither than I expected: I went out to Haddington, and they nursed me with the greatest care till I was completely recovered. Brown or Margaret Farries<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Brown married Margaret Farries. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240529-TC-JJ-01">TC to JJ, <date when="1824-05-29">29 May</date></ref>.</note> I did not see or hear of tho&#x2019; I inquired and intended to call. The worthy people would not let me leave Haddington; or by dint of making great efforts I might have been in London to-day by the steam-boat of Wednesday. To-night I sail in a handsome smack with only four fellow passengers, Sir Something and two ladies and Mr Something. The wind is pretty good. We expect to be there in a week. About ten or twelve days after this, the Coach will bring you a letter from me.</p>
<p>You will be happy to learn that we are not bound for Cornwall at present, perhaps not at all. I had a letter from Buller very kindly anxious to see me: he is standing candidate for the post of an India Director;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Buller, Sr., father of the Buller boys tutored by Carlyle in Edinburgh. He did not get the post. Coleridge tells us in his <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> (ed. E. L. Griggs [Oxford, <date when="1956">1956</date>], I, 303, 388) that his own father received the appointment at Ottery St. Mary through the influence of the father of Charles Buller, Sr., and that Charles Buller, Sr., was tutored by Coleridge&#x2019;s father. The Bullers, the Kirkpatricks, and the Stracheys, who intermarried with one another, were all very active in Indian affairs and did much to direct the Carlyles&#x2019; attention to colonial problems.</note> and it is proposed to take Lodgings for the boys and me somewhere in the rural vicinity of London, and let us carry on our studies as our own humour suits. This I shall like far better than going to Looe.</p>
<p>Here in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I have managed all things quite well. I have just accompanied to Farries&#x2019; lodgings a packet for home, containing two copies of the Novel<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>.</note> for the Boys, some odds and ends for my father, and a small cheap shawl for you. This was selected and cheapened for you at Haddington by my good Jane; a circumstance which I assured her would not diminish its value in your eyes. I saw the Targer <pb id="pg-03-78" n="03:78"/>for two days: he left me this morning; we are to meet again in London. He goes to France about july; is well enough, I think, but as full of whims as possible. He thought I had poisoned him by pouring <hi rend="italic">two</hi> not <hi rend="italic">one</hi> spoonful of milk into his tea this very morning. At least so I declared to him, with much laughter. He is as affectionate &#x26; honest as ever. I have got a letter to Thomas Campbell the Poet from Brewster, and one to Telford<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Telford (<date when="1757">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834">1834</date>), Scottish civil engineer, friend of Campbell and Southey, and well known in the literary world.</note> (for whom I care not two doits): the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> promises me a multitude of others, as soon as he can get them written. With Boyd I settled finally, and yesterday converted his bill into a check for &#xa3;180 payable at sight in London. I rejoice that such was my bargain: I should have been very unhappy else at present. I have also sent off all my copies&#x2014;8 to London, 2 home, 1 Targer, 1 Murray, 1 Mrs Brewster, Mrs Johnston Grange, Ben Nelson, Waugh &#x26;c &#x26;c<supplied>[.]</supplied> George Bell the Surgeon would take <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> for his advising and drugs: I gave him a copy also. So that now they are all disposed of together.</p>
<p>Tell Jack that <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Tell</hi> is coming for him by Farries: I would have sent the shoes, but could not possibly get them packed. Bid the good Logician, but most faithful brother, write as soon as ever he gets my address. Great things are expected of him by various people. Tell him Boyd will send two <hi rend="italic">Pauls</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Paul et Virginie</hi>, just published.</note> down whenever they are ready. I also make him heir <supplied>[to my]</supplied> seal-skin cap: I missed it three minutes after he was g<supplied>[one, ju]</supplied>st three minutes too late.</p>
<p>But now my dear Mother I am going. The people are bringing me tea; after which Murray is to come and accompany me down to Leith. I will write directly. There is no danger at all: the weather is beautiful as summer should be: and is not God the ruler of water as of Land? May His blessing be upon you all forever! Give my kindest love to all the posse of brothers &#x26; sisters, beginning with Alick &#x26; ending with Jenny. Their names and interests are all present with me at this moment. <closer><salute>My best affection to my Father. I am always</salute></closer></p>

<dateline><place>London 4. Middleton Terrace Pentonville</place>, / Friday-afternoon (<date when="1824-06-10">10th June 1824</date>)</dateline>
<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p><pb id="pg-03-80" n="03:80"/>I lose not a moment in relieving you from all your anxieties about me, which I doubt not have <supplied>[of]</supplied> late been neither few nor small. I arrived here three <supplied>[hours ago,]</supplied> whole in wind and limb; was hospitably received by Edw<supplied>[ard Irving and]</supplied> his lady, have dined with them, been walking to and fro about the environs in company with his Reverence, and am now sitting scribbling to you in his drawing room, the most quiet and mild looking place in this monstrous capital.</p>
<p>The details of my voyage would be long: I reserve the minute delineation of them to some <hi rend="italic">winter evening at Mainhill</hi>, when you shall have them all in proper order. A few minutes after closing your letter I set out in great haste to find the Smack at Leith, imagining I should be too late, and not caring much, as my place was not taken up, tho&#x2019; I should not go till Wednesday morning in the steamboat. I was in time enough however, so I ran off with your letter to the post-office, took out my place, and was in Leith Roads <supplied>[The Firth of Forth]</supplied> at Sunset. The evening went away in my surveying the companions of my pilgrimage, the most prominent of whom was a little snub-nosed French German whose cookery of a <hi rend="italic">craap</hi> (crab) for supper, and eating of it with pepper &#x26; porter alternately amused and irritated me. Monsieur Dubois<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> proved to be a very singular character. Sir David Innes<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fifth Baronet (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866">1866</date>). See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240623-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1824-06-23">23 June</date></ref>.</note> the partner of my little cabin was one almost equally singular&#x2014; the most innocent, most polite, most ugly and most stupid of the sons of men. Captain Smith from about Linlithgow was if possible still weaker, and litter bred: the conversation of these two persons tired me to the borders of death. All the sillyisms in the natural and moral world were successively submitted to my <supplied>[in]</supplied>spection, and I longed bitterly for sudden dumbness to <hi rend="italic">them</hi> or <supplied>[total]</supplied> deafness to myself. There was also a young man who took snuff, and two ladies who lay sick all the way. With these fellow voyagers the business could not but be wearisome. Yet on the whole it passed away far better than I anticipated. By a strange arrangement of affairs I <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> in a place like a book shelf, with the ugly Knight beside me snoring faithfully, and noises out of number at my head and feet and all sides of me. I even often slept throughout the day. The weather too, tho&#x2019; tedious at first and often calm<supplied>[,]</supplied> was on the whole favourable. I surveyed all the shore of my old Fife and East Lothian, along which we coasted very slowly; I saw St Abb&#x2019;s head, Flamborough head, and after passing a tedious day in the midst of fog; on Wednesdaynight it began to blow, and in <pb id="pg-03-81" n="03:81"/>the space of fifte<supplied>[e]</supplied>n hours we passed over a tract of 140 miles and never halted till we dropt anchor last night in the Thames. We saw Yarmouth, Lowestoffe &#x26;c &#x26;c, with much shipping and land at least new to us; and this morning we had a delightful view of the River &#x26; its ships in tens of thousands, its coal-heavers, bargemen, mackarel men and variegated population from Purfleet (14 miles down) up to the London Dock. It is an astounding sight: on approaching the city, its dense masses of grim smoky buildings, its forests of masts, and the sound as of a million of hammers as if proceeding in louder and fainter notes from many-handed labour, give a strange impression of the bulk and bustle of this mighty place. At last we moored: after much delay, hackney coachmen were procured, I got my trunks into the belly of one (coach of course!) and myself along with them, and drove along thro&#x2019; the city to Pentonville, where Irving and his wife received me with the most cordial welcome. I shall be quite happy here for the time I stay. Since I came, Mrs Strachey<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Edward Strachey (<date when="1791">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846">1846</date>), grandmother of Lytton Strachey and one of Carlyle&#x2019;s most highly valued friends and benefactors. See C. R. Sanders, <hi rend="italic">The Strachey Family, <date when="1588">1588</date>&#x2013;<date when="1932">1932</date></hi> (Durham, N.C., <date when="1953">1953</date>), pp. 108&#x2013;46.</note> (Mrs Buller&#x2019;s sister) has incidentally called; and I was introduced to her. She seems a fine body, if I may apply that term to a lady of such appearance: she was going to call for her sister; so I sent a copy of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> (8 of them are lying here safe) with her, and word that I would wait on Mrs Buller to-morrow. It seems the Shooter&#x2019;s hill<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Country home of the Edward Stracheys down the Thames near Woolwich. Carlyle visited there often during this sojourn in London and met Kitty Kirkpatrick there. It has a rose garden which is reflected in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>, in which the heroine Blumine is the &#x201C;Rose-Goddess.&#x201D; Blumine is a composite of Margaret Gordon, Kitty Kirkpatrick, and Jane Welsh. Kitty, the daughter of James Achilles Kirkpatrick, was the cousin of Mrs. Buller and Mrs. Strachey, born Isabella and Julia Kirkpatrick, respectively, daughters of Colonel William Kirkpatrick.</note> scheme is again in the back ground: it <supplied>[is]</supplied> the place where Mrs Strachey staid, and she could not get lodgings quite commodiously. They now speak of various things, I understand, but their plans are so vague, that it is needless to spend time in detailing them. Only I do not think we shall go to Cornwall, which was a scheme I never liked.</p>
<p>Thus, my dear Mother, have you got a hurried sketch of my history, up to this day. Let us all be grateful to Providence that things are as they are! I only want to learn that you are well in order to be altogether happy.&#x2014; If I had kept this letter a day or two I might I suppose have had a <hi rend="italic">frank</hi>, but knowing your impatience, I would not put off a moment. You will get word of me on Sabbath-day, when I think it <pb id="pg-03-82" n="03:82"/>is likely you will ask for this at the Office. Have the Boys got their books yet? Tell Jack to hold himself in readiness to write to me: Alick I will not ask till I am settled. They must tell me what they think of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> as they get along. I left it booked for <hi rend="italic">Farries</hi>: I do not think the book is selling yet; but I care not a jot: Boyd will make himself sure, and the &#xa3;180 <hi rend="italic">are</hi> with me.</p>
<p>Tell Jack if he do not hear of me within a week to write directing hither. Remember me in the warmest love to my Father, and all the rest great and small. May the Great Father bless you all! We are some miles asunder, but we will never forget one another; and we hope to meet, after many partings and meetings upon earth, in a scene where parting is never known. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my <supplied>[de]</supplied>ar Mother! my thoughts delight to dwell with y<supplied>[ou.]</supplied> <closer><salute>I am always yours aff<hi rend="italic">e</hi>,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dearest&#x2014;</salute> Were I to delay longer it would seem unkind, and you might feel uneasy on account of me; yet if I write at present, it must <pb id="pg-03-83" n="03:83"/>be under the most importunate distractions, and vaguely as a man writes in a scene foreign to him, and among many circumstances which perplex him. Ever since parting with you, I have been bowled about incessantly; continually in motion, my thoughts also have been fitful, brief and manycoloured: I have laid up the materials of some ideas, but as yet they are unworked, and their presence excludes those that lay finished in my mind before. But to you, my <foreign><hi rend="italic">s&#xfc;sse</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">s</hi>]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">Liebchen</hi></foreign> [sweet darling], any thing from me has a value not intrinsic or dependent on its own qualities. You will peruse my travel&#x2019;s history with patience; and in return for it, you will send me your own; full frank and <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi>. Will you not?</p>
<p>I had the most melancholy sail to London. Cross winds, storms, and what was ten times worse, dead calms, and the stupidest society in nature. Sir David Innes, if indeed he be a knight of flesh and blood and not a mere shadowy personification of Dulness, snored assiduously beside me all night, and talked the most polite ineptitudes all day. He had a large long head like a sepulchral urn; his face pockpitted, hirsute and bristly was at once vast and hatchet-shaped. He stood for many hours together with his left hand laid upon the boat on the middle of the deck, and the thumb of his right hand stuck firmly with its point on the hip joint; his large blue rheumy eyes gazing on vacancy, the very image of thick-lipped musing. Captain Smith was of quite an opposite species, brisk, lean, whisking, smart of speech and quick in bowing; but if possible still more inane than Dulness. These two, Dulness and Inanity, contrived to tell me, in the course of our voyage, nearly all the truisms which natural and moral science have yet enriched the world withal. They demonstrated to me that sea-sickness was painful, that sea-captains ought to be expert, that London was a great city, that the Turks eat opium, that the Irish were discontented, that brandy would intoxicate. Oh! I thought I should have given up the ghost! Monsieur Dubois a Strasburgher, Lord Bute&#x2019;s factotum, with his flageolet, his <foreign><hi rend="italic">vaillant Troubadour</hi></foreign> and his <foreign><hi rend="italic">Es hatt&#x2019; ein Bauer ein Sch&#xF6;nes Weib</hi></foreign>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Gallant Troubadour&#x201D; and &#x201C;A Farmer Had a Pretty Wife&#x201D; were presumably songs.</note> alone contributed to save me. I laughed at him every day about an hour. On Sunday, do you suppose I was very gay? The Bass<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bass Rock near Haddington off the coast. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250113-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1825-01-13">13 Jan. 1825</date></ref>.</note> was standing in sight all day; and I recollected where the Sunday before I had been sitting beside you in peace and quietness <hi rend="italic">at home</hi>! But time and hours wear out the <pb id="pg-03-84" n="03:84"/>roughest day:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, I, iii.</note> next Friday at noon we were winding slowly thro&#x2019; the forest of masts in the Thames up to our station at Tower wharf. The giant bustle, the coal-heavers, the bargemen, the black buildings, the ten thousand times ten thousand sounds and movements of that monstrous harbour formed the grandest object I had ever witnessed. One man seems as a drop in the ocean; you feel annihilated in the immensity of that heart of all the Earth.</p>
<p>The good Orator and his &#x2018;dear Isabella&#x2019; welcomed me with cordial words and looks; I thanked them from the bottom of my heart; for kindness in a strange land, is doubly kind. I staid with them till yesterday, and got along far better than I had anticipated. The orator is mended since I saw him at Dunkeld: he begins to see that his honours are not supernatural; and his honest practical warmth of heart is again becoming the leading feature in his character. Depend upon it, my dearest, you must not cast this man entirely away. He still loves you; he still means to attach you to him by substantial services. He contemplates your journey to London next Summer as a thing certain; a thing from which you and he are both to derive much enjoyment and advantage. I said you seemed <hi rend="italic">indisposed</hi> to it now; and that was all I said. Do not cast him quite away, if you can help it: as men go, there are very very few that even approach him in true worth, deducting all his faults; and true affection is so precious that any touch of it intermingled even with many other feelings in the bosom of an honest man is worth the keeping.</p>
<p>How I spent my time in London I will take a week to tell you when <hi rend="italic">we meet</hi>. I have seen some notable characters; of whom I long to speak with you at large. Mrs Montagu<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18231014-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1823-10-14">14 Oct. 1823</date></ref>.</note> (do not tremble) is a stately matron with a quick intellect and a taste for <hi rend="italic">exciting sentiments</hi> which two qualities by dint of much management in a longish life she has elaborated into the materials of a showy, tasteful, clear sighted, rigid, and I fancy cold manner of existence, intended rather for itself and for being looked at, than for being used to any useful purpose in the service of others. She loves and admires the orator beyond all others: me she seems to like better than I like her. I have also seen and scraped acquaintance with Procter (Barry Cornwall) he is a slender, rough-faced, palish, gentle, languid looking man of three or four &#x26; thirty; there is a dreamy mildness in his eye; he is kind and good in his manners and I understand in his conduct: he is a <pb id="pg-03-85" n="03:85"/>poet by the ear and the fancy, but his heart and <supplied>[his]</supplied> intellect are not strong, he is is [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] a small poet. I am also a <hi rend="italic">nascent</hi> friend <supplied>[of]</supplied> Allan Cunningham&#x2019;s;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240625-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1824-06-25">25 June</date></ref>.</note> my dear modest, kind, good-humoured Allan. He has his <supplied>[Niths]</supplied>dale accent as faithfully as if he had never crossed the border; he seems not to know that he is any thing beyond a reading Mason.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He began his working career as a stone-mason.</note> Yet I will send you his books, and tell you of him; and you will find in him a genius of no common make. I have also seen Thomas Campbell: him I like worst of all. He is heartless as a little Edinburgh Advocate; there is a smirk on his face which would befit a shopman or an auctioneer; his very eye has the cold vivacity of a conceited worldling. His talk is small, contemptuous and shallow: the blue frock and trowsers, the eye glass, the wig, the very fashion of his bow proclaim the literary dandy. His wife<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Born Matilda Sinclair, she married Campbell in <date when="1803">1803</date> and died in <date when="1828">1828</date>. She has been described as Spanish in appearance.</note> has black eyes, a fair skin, a symmetrical but vulgar face; and she speaks with that accursed Celtic accent, a twang which I never yet heard associated with any manly or profitable thought or sentiment; which to me is but the symbol of Highland vanity and filth and famine. &#x2018;Good heavens!&#x2019; cried I, on coming out, &#x2018;does literature then lead to this? Shall I too by my utmost efforts realize nothing but a stupid Gaelic wife, with the pitiful gift of making verses; and affections cold as those of a tinker&#x2019;s <foreign>cuddie</foreign>? With nothing to love but my own paltry self and what belongs to it? My proudest feelings rivalled, surpassed by Lord Petersham,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230701-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-07-01">1 July 1823</date></ref>.</note> and the whole population of Bond-Street? God forbid! Let me be poor and wretched, if it must be so; but never never let the holy feeling of affection leave me! Break my heart a hundred times, but never let it be its own grave!&#x2019;&#x2014; The aspect of that man jarred the music of my mind for a whole day. He promised to invite me to his first &#x201C;literary <foreign>dejeuner</foreign>&#x201D;: curiosity attracts, disgust repels; I know not whether will be stronger when the day arrives. Perhaps I am hasty about Campbell; perhaps I am too severe: he was my earliest favourite; I hoped to have found him different.&#x2014; Of Coleridge, and all the other originals I will not say a word at present: you are sated and more.</p>
<p>Yet there is one original whom I wish I had ten sheets to write about; my own dearest <hi rend="italic">original</hi>, whose image is never far from me, tho&#x2019; many a weary mile-stone lies between us. How <hi rend="italic">are</hi> you my beloved Enemy? Are you well? Are you busy? Alas! I think of Haddington, 
<pb id="pg-03-86" n="03:86"/>and the Green, and <hi rend="italic">Paradise</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Paradise,&#x2019; better known as &#x2018;Greenknowe,&#x2019; is a very pretty little place a short distance farther out of Haddington than Sunnybank (Tenterfield) so often mentioned in Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s Letters.&#x2014; There is also a &#x2018;Paradise&#x2019; at Ormiston, six or seven miles from Haddington&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> and your little garden;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to A. Carlyle, the garden was 146 feet long and 46 feet wide.</note> they come before my eyes, among strange scenes, with the clearness of paintings; and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> and I are not there. Will you write to me next day? Do, Jane, if you love me: you may figure how I long to hear of you. Write like your own kind self&#x2014;immediately&#x2014;to your friend who loves you, whose friend you are <foreign><hi rend="italic">auf ewig</hi></foreign> [to eternity]. I know you; you will not keep me waiting an hour that you can help&#x2014; Is Rubezahl far advanced again? Is your mother well and kind to you and me? Assure her of my affectionate esteem. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu!</foreign> I wait anxiously to hear of you: I am your own forever,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>The address is Mr Page&#x2019;s, Kew-Green, London. We are here in lodgings (Charlie B. &#x26; I) only for a time. I have ceased to admire Mrs Buller and her manner of proceeding: I had to tell her in brief terms some fragments of my mind, to bring her from the vapours to the earth. She fears me, but she loves no one. They speak of France; but I do not think of going with them.</p>
<p>The place is pleasant and quiet, and coaches every half hour will take you to London for a shilling. It has rained three fourths of the time since I left you: to-day and yesterday, it poured incessantly. Write soon, that I may write soon and tell you more. God bless you dearest! farewell &#x26; love me!</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>It is long since I had a right trustful confabulation with thee in the way of letter; yet I need scarcely say how much of late I have hungered and thirsted after it. I wrote a hurried letter to our Father the day before yesterday, meaning that it should be franked: but Charlie Buller is a man whose purposes are as air; he disappointed me, and again disappointed me; still seeing no end to it, I scribbled three or four unintelligible words to the end of the letter in extreme haste, the Postman waiting all the while, and sent it off, imagining at least that it would save you from anxieties about my health and general welfare, tho&#x2019; vague in itself, and intended originally to accompany another more special narrative. To-night I have got an hour of leisure to collect my scattered and dissipated thoughts: Buller is over at his Uncle&#x2019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently James Buller (see end of this letter).</note> and I write to you undisturbed. He is to procure me a frank: if not, we can do without it.</p>
<p>From my Father&#x2019;s letter you would gather that Mrs Buller&#x2019;s settlement of our affairs was not by any means entirely according to my heart. In fact this wandering wayfaring mode of life is altogether unsatisfactory to me: you never once can say what is to be done with you; no measures for the future; you live from day to day, and are perplexed with a thousand inconveniences, which in my case, unhealthy as I am, are greatly aggravated. The Bullers also are essentially a cold race of people; they live in the midst of fashion and external show; they love no living creature. Our connection therefore has to sit a little loosely: I attach no portion of my hopes or thoughts of affection to them, they none to me. Nevertheless I have engaged to go with them whithersoever they list for the next three months: after that, with regard to their France project I shall pause before deciding. Indeed so fitful and weathercock-like in their proceedings are they, that it is very possible the whole scheme of Boulogne sur mer may be abandoned long before the time for trying it comes round. Meanwhile Mrs B. has settled us here (<hi rend="italic">for a fortnight only</hi>!) in lodgings, and we have begun our studies. It is a pleasant village; we are within a bowshot of a royal palace, close by the south bank of the Thames about six miles to the westward of London. A village here is not what it is <pb id="pg-03-89" n="03:89"/>with you. Here it is a quantity of houses scattered over a whole parish; each cluster connected with the rest by lanes of trees, with meadows and beautiful greens interspersed; sometimes ponds and lakes and hedges of roses, and commons with sheep and cuddies grazing on them. Many of the houses belong to rich people, and the whole has a very smart and pleasing air. Such is the village of Kew, especially the Green&#x2014;the part of it which lies on the south side of the river, connected by a bridge with Kew proper. We form part of the periphery of an irregular square measuring perhaps 2 furlongs in diagonal, intersected with one large and many foot roads; cut into portions by thick low painted wooden paling, with breaks in it to admit the freest ingress and egress. The parish Church with its cluster of gravestones stands a little to the right of our windows: beyond it, the northwest corner of the square is occupied by the palace and the barracks of soldiers. This with the many barges and lighters of the river, and the shady woods and green places all around makes the place very pretty. What is better our lodging seems to be very respectable: I have a good clean quiet bed, and the landlady Mrs Page and her pretty grandaughter (&#x201C;sweet Ann Page!&#x201D;)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi>, III, i.</note> almost become as dead women every time we speak to them&#x2014;so reverential are they and so prompt to help. Charlie too is laying or has laid aside his vanities, and is very attentive and respectful considering his usual humour. On the whole I could be content to stay here till october, rather than shift about again: but I bow beneath the potent will of Mrs B. <hi rend="italic">for these three months</hi>, and go withersoever she listeth<supplied>[.]</supplied> It is true I shall be solitary here; yet not altogether so. Allan Cunningham has promised to introduce me to Carey<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry F. Cary (<date when="1772">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844">1844</date>), English clergyman and translator, published his translation of the <hi rend="italic">Divine Comedy</hi> between <date when="1805">1805</date> and <date when="1814">1814</date>.</note> the Translator of Dante, a parson of a parish in this neighbourhood; Irving has already introduced me to a Mr Kirkpatrick, two miles off, whom I intend to visit one of these days. Besides for a shilling I can be conveyed to London every half hour; and we shall not want for books. So it may be made to do.</p>
<p>Of London the great Nineveh of modern Europe, I will tell you more minutely when we meet. The chief things in it that strike me are its vastness and expensiveness. You cannot stir in it without money, money, at every hand. Here for instance we have two little bedrooms and a parlour, considerably less, and not much better furnished than Wilkie&#x2019;s&#x2014;for which Mrs B. is to pay for us two at the easy rate of 2 guieneas per week! In winter it will be twelve shillings more for fuel: <pb id="pg-03-90" n="03:90"/>this excluding perquisites for brushing shoes, going errands &#x26;c &#x26;c!!! A man had need to be provided with cash that takes up his quarters here: I am told one need not try to live in any thing like what they call respectability for less than &#xa3; 150 a year&#x2014;in lodgings: boarding they say is considerably cheaper. So much for the cost of London&#x2014;a matter not to me of absolute indifference, at least in prospect.</p>
<p>Yet in prospect only&#x2014;for as yet I have felt but little of it. Irving&#x2019;s hospitable mansion was mine; he received me with as warm a welcome as ever. I think him much more pleasant than when we last met: he has begun to see that there is nothing supernatural in his situation; he is leaner and in weaker health, so his spirits are less ebullient, and the honest practical substantial expressions of his intellect and heart have again got uppermost. His popularity without being furious as it once was is still great, long rows of coaches crowd daily to his sooty-looking meagre chapel; nor are ladies of rank wanting among the weekly applicants for tickets of admission. However he is ceasing to be a Lion&#x2014;and I trust becoming something humbler and more abiding. I still reckon him one way and another about the worthiest man I have ever seen. To me he has certainly been friendly as few men are to any but a brother. I also like his wife; who, at present in the family way, looks very plain, but is certainly a very model of a wife. Submissive, helpful, ever good-humoured, her sole object seems to be her husband&#x2019;s comfort, and that of his friends.</p>
<p>Besides Irving I have seen many other curiosities. Not the least of these I reckon Coleridge, the Kantean metaphysician and quondam Lake poet. I will tell you all about our interview <hi rend="italic">when we meet</hi>. Figure a fat flabby incurvated personage, at once short, rotund and relaxed, with a watery mouth, a snuffy nose, a pair of strange brown timid yet earnest looking eyes, a high tapering brow, and a great bush of grey hair&#x2014;you will have some faint idea of Coleridge. He is a kind, good soul, full of religion and affection, and poetry and animal magnetism. His cardinal sin is that he wants <hi rend="italic">will</hi>; he has no resolution, he shrinks from pain or labour in any of its shapes. His very attitude bespeaks this: he never straightens his knee joints, he stoops with his fat ill shapen shoulders, and in walking he does not tread but shovel and slide&#x2014;my father would call it <foreign><hi rend="italic">skluiffing</hi></foreign>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scots <hi rend="italic">sklufe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">skloof</hi>: &#x201C;to trail the feet along the ground in walking.&#x201D;</note> He is also always busied to keep by strong and frequent inhalations the water of his mouth from overflowing; and his eyes have a look of anxious impotence; he <hi rend="italic">would</hi> do with all his heart, but he knows he dare not. The conversation <pb id="pg-03-91" n="03:91"/>of the man is much as I anticipated. A forest of thoughts; some true, many false, most part dubious, all of them ingenious in some degree, often in a high degree. But there is no method in his talk; he wanders like a man sailing among many currents, whithersoever his lazy mind directs him&#x2014;; and what is more unpleasant he preaches, or rather soliloquizes: he cannot speak; he can only &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">tal-k</hi>&#x201D; (so he names it). Hence I found him unprofitable, even tedious: but we parted very good friends I promising to go back and see him some other evening&#x2014;a promise I fully intend to keep. I sent him a copy of Meister about which we had some friendly talk. I reckon him a man of great and useless genius&#x2014;a strange not at all a great man.</p>
<p>I have also seen Procter (Barry Cornwall), and even begun a kind of <hi rend="italic">friendship</hi> (!) with him. He is connected with the <hi rend="italic">celebrated</hi> Mrs Montagu&#x2014;whom also I have seen, and liked tho&#x2019; not too highly or even so highly as she seemed to wish. Procter is an ingenious gentle little fellow: a poet or rather <hi rend="italic">poety</hi>, for he is small in his dimensions mental &#x26; bodily. Allan Cunningham is my greatest favourite; not the cleverest, but the simplest, frankest, most modest. He speaks with the Nithsdale accent as true as our Uncle John, whom he knows and once worked with. We have exchanged books, and seem to take to one another. Thomas Campbell also I have seen, but far from liked. He is a dapper little black-bearded, brown-wi<supplied>[gged,]</supplied> blue-frocked, smart-speaking, <foreign>whisking</foreign> [brisk] gentleman&#x2014;a poor lite<supplied>[rary]</supplied> dandy&#x2014;with the air and manner of a pert Scotch Advocate, heartless conceited, shallow, sneering, pragmatical. There is no mystery in his looks; his eye glances, but it is with the empty vivacity of a Cockney Shopman. Poor Campbell! Suffering &#x26; poverty have wasted his feelings, and made him callous and dissociable as <hi rend="italic">those old Nags</hi>, which I once heard a Natural Historian describe, as animals that cared not for other horses. Campbell promised to invite me to what he called his &#x201C;next literary <foreign>dejeuner</foreign>&#x201D;&#x2014;where I suppose will be collected many of the hacks that live by ink in this busy city. I know not whether I shall go. I wish to see the base Phrygian Turks;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi>, I, iii.</note> but farther&#x2014;&#x201C;my soul come not into their secret, mine honour be not united to them!&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 49:6.</note></p>
<p>Now I presume, my <foreign>bonny</foreign> boy, thou art sated with my prattle: my paper is done, tho&#x2019; my subject is but beginning. However I must pause for a time. Doubt not, my dear Jack, that I long earnestly to hear from home after this long silence. Send the Newspaper; and <pb id="pg-03-92" n="03:92"/>above all, write, write. Tell me how every thing goes on, how my Mother is, how they all are. How do you prosper in your studies&#x2014;and of what sort are they? Take an immense sheet, and write as close as close can be. Did you get <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>; did they get them at Annan?

The passage reads: &#x201C;Goethe&#x2019;s justly celebrated Novel, <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi>, has just been translated into English; and it will doubtless be as much read in England as upon the Continent. &#x2026; The translator appears to us to have performed his task admirably, for the style is simple, free, and forcible.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I have just got a frank that will carry any weight, and tho&#x2019; my time for despatching it is limited, the messenger shall not depart till it holds a little flying notice to my faithful brother. Doubtless you have listened to the narrative of all my adventures communicated in other letters, and are therefore no stranger to my wanderings, to and fro, since I parted with you all that still morning at the end of the <pb id="pg-03-93" n="03:93"/>Mainhill house, when there was so little lightness of heart to spare in any of us. My history since then has been one restless movement; I have had no leisure to write&#x2014;scarcely to speak or think. Often have I pictured with astonishment the still life of Mainhill, its quiet scenes and peaceful simple labours, while pressing thro&#x2019; the chaotic streets of this unspeakable place. It is with the hope of getting news from Mainhill that I now write.</p>
<p>I will not try to describe London&#x2014;the great desart of Brick. It may be said to extend seven or eight miles every way; there are clusters of streets and houses hanging round it with scarcely any interruption to that distance at least in all directions. The interior consists of streets not broad or very crooked, and not always <hi rend="italic">very</hi> narrow, jammed together in such complex and perverse fashions that to pilot your way thro&#x2019; them is a task of no small magnitude. I regularly lost my way for the first three or four days. In the newer parts of the town, you have roomy squares with trees and grass plots intermingled, which gives an air of freshness very pleasing to the eye. The unbuilt spaces are full of brick kilns; there are some villages in the neighbourhood, where the sulphurous smell of them is very offensive. You may conceive their magnitude &#x26; extent when I tell you that London requires to be rebuilt every fifty years. Around the north &#x26; west sides (the fashionable quarters) of the town are large parks with the usual ornaments; beyond these the never-ending houses begin again. But far eastward in what is called the City, the oldest part of London, are lanes and dingy alleys the chosen abodes of poverty and vice; where no kindly breeze or sunlight, or the step of any messenger of peace ever penetrates. I saw St Giles&#x2019;s Seven Dials, and Dyott street: it is a city of <hi rend="italic"><foreign>Cuddy</foreign>-lanes</hi>. There dwell 100 thousand Irishmen, in the lowest state of filth and poverty. Their children were puddling in the gutters, ragged, wild and careless: it made me sad to think that most of them were breeding for the hulks and the gallows! But such is London: you have the highest and the lowest, the happiest and most wretched, both internal and external, all huddled and simmering together in strange contiguity.</p>
<p>Of the buildings I have said enough at present: when I see you I will tell you of Westminster Abbey; and St Pauls, the only edifice that every [ever] struck me with a proper sense of grandeur. I was hurrying along Cheapside into Newgate-street amid a thousand bustling pigmies, and the innumerable jinglings and rollings and crashings of manycoloured labour, when all at once, on passing from the abode <pb id="pg-03-94" n="03:94"/>of John Gilpin,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hero of William Cowper&#x2019;s poem &#x201C;The Diverting History of John Gilpin&#x201D; (<date when="1782">1782</date>), a linen-draper who lived in Cheapside.</note> stunned by the tumult of his restless compeers, I looked up from the boiling throng, thro&#x2019; a little opening at the corner of the street&#x2014;and there stood Paul&#x2019;s&#x2014;with its columns and friezes and massy wings of bleached yet unworn stone; with its statues and its graves around it; with its solemn dome four hundred feet above me, and its guilded ball and cross gleaming in the evening sun, piercing up into the heaven thro&#x2019; the vapours of our earthly home! It was silent as Tadmor of the wilderness:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Kings 9:18; 2 Chron. 8:4.</note> gigantic, beautiful, enduring: it seemed to frown with a rebuking pity on the vain scramble which it overlooked: at its feet were tomb-stones, above it was the everlasting sky, within it priests perhaps were chanting hymns; it seemed to transmit with a stern voice the Sounds of Death, Judgement and Eternity thro&#x2019; all that frivolous and fluctuating city. I saw it oft and from various points and never without new admiration.</p>
<p>Of the people whom I saw I have already said something, and have little space for saying more. Many of them were very kind to me, for Irving&#x2019;s sake; particularly two Hamiltons from Sanquhar<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of them, William&#x2014;&#x201C;a very honest, shrewd and pious Nithsdale man, who wedded a Sister of Mrs. Irving&#x2019;s by and by, and whom I knew till his death&#x201D;&#x2014;is mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 121. William Hamilton was a merchant of Cheapside, later a respected elder of Irving&#x2019;s church and a steadying influence.</note>&#x2014;merchants here, who got my bank bill cashed; took me to tailors and watchmakers, and seemed vexed they could not get more done for me. Allan Cunningham<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1784">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842">1842</date>), poet and miscellaneous writer. He was a great favorite with Carlyle and, later, Carlyle&#x2019;s wife: &#x201C;We admired always his shrewd sense for managing himself in strange London; his stalwart healthy figure and ways (bright hazel eyes, bald open brow, sonorous hearty tone of voice; a tall, perpendicular, quietly manful-looking figure); and were sorry sincerely to lose him, as we suddenly did&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 176).</note> and all the other literary people Jack will tell you of. I once or twice saw Thomas Dickson<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving&#x2019;s sister Janet (<date when="1794">1794</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1849">1849</date>) married a Robert Dickson (b. <date when="1783">1783</date>), who had served as provost of Annan from <date when="1821">1821</date> to <date when="1823">1823</date>.

He says I want only to know <hi rend="italic">how to eat</hi>, in order to be well. But the strangest person whom I heard of was&#x2014;William Bogs of Ecclefechan! The scullion called on Irving one morning when I was out, <hi rend="italic">with a young wife</hi>, and told him a thousand lies, about his fortune, his learning, his connexions; bragging that he learned French along with Brother Jack (who was quite wrong, he said, in the pronunciation), that he was a &#x201C;professor of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">belles letters</hi></foreign>,&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c! The abandoned Knave! I told Irving to trust him no hairs breadth beyond his sight; that he was married already, and was the most worthless person in the county he came from. Irving &#x201C;knew that he was lying and determined to see no more of him.&#x201D; I could not get the rascal from my thoughts. He has inveigled this silly woman, who seemed to be some shop keeper&#x2019;s daughter, they said; most likely she has a hundred or two of pounds, and the heartless Bigamist is prowling about on the strength of it, seeking whom he may take in! O these scullions are the disgrace of old Scotland; they should be whipped to Botany Bay with the cat o&#x2019; nine tails at their backs. Do not mind telling that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> saw or spoke of this swindler: let him work out his wicked way unmark<supplied>[ed by]</supplied> us. There is another sprig of Annandale lying sick at Wapping in London&#x2014;David Johnston,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A David Johnston matriculated in the sessions of <date when="1808">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1809">9</date> and <date when="1810">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811">11</date> at Edinburgh, but did not graduate. In <date when="1808">1808</date> he gave as his address simply Dumfriesshire.</note> a Doctor once of Hawbank, then of Satur, then of Banks Hill, now of that ilk. He drove himself mad with drinking, and was turned out of Hannay&#x2019;s packet at Falmouth; he still seems to be cracked; he wrote the other day to Edward Irving, requesting in a very crazy style a loan of five pounds to carry him down to Scotland! Irving had <hi rend="italic">no answer to send</hi>. Davie&#x2019;s Brother is a gambler here, I understand, who lives by his skill in billiards and cards. What a dainty race of men we are, we men of Annandale!</p>
<p>But I am wasting my time with talking about all this. I have little <pb id="pg-03-96" n="03:96"/>more than room to beg of you to write as speedily as may be, and send me all your thoughts and purposes. Is Bardolph sold or Fingal? Many a time I have remembered my brave gray steed. Would that I had him here even now! Tell me all that is going on among you and about you, and how it is with every one of you. Present my heart&#x2019;s love to every one by name&#x2014;to Mag, to Jamie, Mary, Jean and Jenny. Poor things! they are often in my thoughts, and always with the aspect of true affection. I doubt not we shall all do well: I solemnly believe that we shall all be honest men and women, and that is nine tenths of the whole matter.&#x2014; Did you get <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, and how do you <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>like it? For really it is a most mixed performance, and tho&#x2019; intellectually good, much of it is morally bad. It is making way here perhaps&#x2014;but slowly: a second edition seems a dubious matter.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Boyd never published one. A second edition, &#x201C;with many little changes,&#x201D; did, however, form a part of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship and Travels</hi> (London: James Fraser, <date when="1839">1839</date>).</note> No difference! I have the produce of the first lying here beside me in hard notes of the Bank of England, and fear no weather. I bought myself a suit of fine clothes&#x2014;for six pounds; a good watch for six; and these were nearly all my purchases. I am going to London one of these days, to see what I can see; to get books &#x26;c &#x26;c.</p>
<p>Now let me hear of your farm-taking schemes: if you can fall in with any likely place, do not hesitate to snatch at it: I could still wish to have a place to came to in Scotland, in case my health did not stand this. Write to me largely: my paper is done; and my inward man<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 Cor. 4:16.</note> warns me that I must go out and walk. God bless you, my dear Brother! We have stood together long, and will always stand together.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever faithfully your&#x2019;s,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Father,</salute>
<p>I sent you off a letter two days ago by the post; not knowing when I might have an opportunity to send it free, and being apprehensive that you would be anxious touching my welfare in this strange country. It so happens that I got a frank last night: but I cannot let it go, <pb id="pg-03-97" n="03:97"/>without adding to the multitude of writings it contains a brief note inquiring more particularly after you, and begging to hear of you. I fear your crops have fared but badly since I went: I hear there has been a parching drought in Scotland ever since I left it. Strange that there should be such a difference! Here in London we have been deluged with rain: for the last two days it poured unceasingly. This morning it was fair; but now it seems about to recommence its drenching. What the aspect of the crops is here, it is impossible for me even to guess. There are literally <hi rend="italic">no</hi> crops within many miles of London. The ground is in grass for the feeding of milk-cows and horses, and the making of hay. The hay crop seems to be very good; the people are just in the middle of it, and unless the weather mend it must be wo<supplied>[e]</supplied>fully spoiled. I delight to see the hay-makers, but I think pensively that last year I saw haymaking at Mainhill.</p>
<p>I find we are going to be somewhat more tolerably situated here than I anticipated. When once a person sits down, and gets himself fairly stationed, the meagerest establishment will be found to yield some entertainment: I now feel little tendency to remove from Kew; except that at Shooters Hill I should enjoy the society of Mrs Strachey who likes me, and whom I like. In other respects matters are pretty much upon a par. This place is quiet and pleasant; and solitude tho&#x2019; irksome is become tolerable to me.</p>
<p>Edward Irving once of Supplebank, the Poyais Emigrator is here at present: he came in to call on <hi rend="italic">Irving</hi>, a night or two ago, while I was there. The Knight of the Green Cross was looking somewhat blue upon the matter; yet he says he will stand it out and see the end of it. He expects a letter from some surveyor at Poyais, which he thinks will set all to rights. Tom of the Bank, his Brother, is with Macgregor at Paris; under the title of <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> [underscored twice] de&#x2014;I forget what! He actually calls himself Baron, he Tom of the Ban<supplied>[k]</supplied>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Baron de Goosedubs</hi>!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Supplebank is a farm in Annandale. The Supplebank Irvings were relatives of Carlyle&#x2019;s intimate friend Edward Irving. For further information on them, on Macgregor, and on Poyais, see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220427-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1822-04-27">27 April 1822</date></ref>. <hi rend="italic">Dubs</hi> are muddy pools in Scots; <hi rend="italic">Goosedubs</hi> is an anticipation of &#x201C;Entepfuhl&#x201D; (&#x201C;Duckpond&#x201D;) in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.</note></p>
<p>But I must finish for my paper <supplied>[is at]</supplied> an end. I beg to hear from you soon; and pray earnestly that you may all be well. <closer><salute>I remain always My dear Father,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dearest Friend</salute>
<p>On Saturday I said within myself, Well I shall surely have a letter tonight! in that case he shall wait three weeks <hi rend="italic">at least</hi> for his answer&#x2014;that he may learn what it is, to count the hours till post-time, day after day&#x2014;to expect and expect till the heart is sick of expectation: and if I do not hear to night! if I do not! the Lord have mercy upon his soul! I shall send him such a letter by tomorrow&#x2019;s post&#x2014;so indignant and so cutting that it shall annihilate him upon the spot. &#x2018;<foreign>Patientia s&#xe6;pe l&#xe6;sa fit furor</foreign>&#x2019;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Furor fit l&#xe6;sa s&#xe6;pius patientia</hi></foreign>&#x201D;: &#x201C;Patience too sorely tried develops into madness&#x201D; (Publilius Syrus, <hi rend="italic">Sententiae</hi> 175).</note> he had better take care what he is about. Let me see&#x2014;it shall begin, &#x2018;Sir&#x2019;&#x2014;and here the Postwomans-one knock at the door put a stop to my musing&#x2014; My Mother came in with a letter&#x2014; I ventured to enquire if it was for me? &#x201C;You may be sure of that,&#x201D; then handing it to me, with a glance at the address, and a smile that boded evil &#x201C;I suppose <hi rend="italic">that</hi> will cure your head,&#x201D; I replied very boldly, &#x2018;I have no doubt but it will help,<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied> and broke the seal with a horrible thumping at my heart: but before I had deciphered the first three lines, I was requested to <hi rend="italic">finish my tea</hi>&#x2014; <foreign>Tod und der Teufel</foreign> [Death and the Devil]! (I must not swear in English) <hi rend="italic">my</hi> tea indeed! I gulped it down like as much senna, which I abominate above all drugs on the face of the earth; and at last I was permitted under these promising auspices, to read to the end!</p>
<p>You cannot think how relieved I was when I perceived from the <hi rend="italic">amendment in</hi> your style that you had got my last. The Orator&#x2019;s address was any thing but legible&#x2014; I could not read it; I could only copy it&#x2014;and it seemed more than probable that my letter instead of reaching its destination, might be returned to me from the post office. Here would have been a pretty catastrophe! a death blow to the commonwealth! but the Gods are with us&#x2014;all is right&#x2014;and do you most headstrong of Adam&#x2019;s children be wiser in the time to come &#x26; bring us into no such danger again.</p>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">sudden</hi> impatience to hear from me is monstrous inconvenient, just at present. for all the magnanimous resolution I made of frighting you out of your wits about me, when it comes to the point <pb id="pg-03-99" n="03:99"/>I cannot bring myself, to occasion you voluntarily a moment&#x2019;s pain: and never was any body less fit for writing or doing any one sensible thing than I am just now.

<salute>Dearest Mother,</salute>
<p>It is within ten minutes of the time for the Post&#x2019;s departure; otherwise believe me I would not have put you off with this meagre scribble, which short as it is, you will scarcely ever make out. Yet it and not go without taking my kindest wishes to you along with it, health my assurances <hi rend="italic">from my own hand</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;From my own hand&#x201D;: Edward Irving&#x2019;s phrase.</note> of being in my usual state of health and comfort, which I know will please you more than any other tidings you can hear.</p>
<p>Are you well, my dear Mother? Make them tell me instantly: Jack might have written ere now; tell him to lose no instant of time. The address is Mr Page&#x2019;s, Kew-Green, London. It is my earnest prayer that you may all be as you ought to be&#x2014;</p>
<p>Since leaving you, tho&#x2019; travelling jades and deranges me, I have not been below my usual degree of health and comfort. In the last respect I have in general been far above it: I have seen many interesting people many whom you would like as well as I. I was at a place called Walthamstow on the other side of London at a meeting of a Bible Society. The people seem to me the best taking them as a whole that I have ever seen. Most of them are merchants and persons of fortune: there is perhaps two or three millions of annual revenue in that and the adjoining parish; and all the surplus of it, or very nearly all, is expended on works of benevolence; in Bible societies, Missionary societies, and Charities of every conceivable sort. It was quite delightful to me to see the honest kind hearted, portly old Englishmen. There were about ten or a dozen clergymen among them, some of whom I liked very much. The priest of Walthamstow is himself one of the best people I ever looked on.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Wilson (<date when="1791">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867">1867</date>) was vicar of Walthamstow from <date when="1822">1822</date> to <date when="1848">1848</date>.</note> He looks somewhat like Duncan of Ruthwell,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rev.

Do but <pb id="pg-03-101" n="03:101"/>think&#x2014;the man has &#xa3;25,000 annually besides &#xa3;500 from his parish, and he spends &#xa3;15,000 in works of pure benificence! His brother in law and curate has &#xa3;10,000 a year and spends in proportion. I assure you my dear Mother, there are a multitude of worthy persons of a similar stamp among us: I mention it because I know it will give you pleasure as it surely does myself.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But dost thou read any in thy Book thou knave?&#x201D; Yes, I assure you without-exaggeration I have read in it very of<supplied>[ten]</supplied> of late and now that I am settled I propose to read still oftener.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I was much obliged by the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> you sent me to Foley Place, and the criticism of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> contained in it&#x2014;shallow and narrow enough it is true, but favourable and on the whole the best it has yet received. I hope ere long to read some <hi rend="italic">article</hi> more worthy of Goethe and his novel, in some more substantial publication. Blackwood&#x2019;s ought to satisfy me; but in truth it is a most meagre account, or rather no account at all, of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, and can serve no purpose farther than an advertising announcement of the work and its repute. An article in Taylor &#x26; Hessy&#x2019;s Magazine on the subject will appear next month, but of what character or by whom I know not.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1824-06-12">12 June 1824</date>; <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, <date when="1824-06">June 1824</date>, pp. 623ff.; <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi>, <date when="1824-08">August 1824</date>, pp. 189 ff.; <date when="1824-09">September 1824</date>, pp. 291 ff. The <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s</hi> review was by J. G. Lockhart, that in the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi> by Thomas De Quincey. Lockhart wrote, in part: &#x201C;We must begin by saying that Goethe has, for once, no reason to complain of his translator. &#x2026; The translator is, we understand, a young gentleman of this city, who now for the first time appears before the public. We congratulate him on his very promising <hi rend="italic">debut</hi>; and would fain hope to receive a series of really good translations from his hand. He evidently has a perfect knowledge of German; he already writes English much better than is at all common even at this time; and we know of no exercise more likely to produce effects of permanent advantage upon a young mind of intellectual ambition.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Whittaker<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. B. and W. B. Whittaker were publishers of Carlyle&#x2019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> in London. G. B. Whittaker (<date when="1793">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847">1847</date>) was in <date when="1824">1824</date> sheriff of London and Middlesex.</note> I have not seen. I called one day at his shop to consult <pb id="pg-03-102" n="03:102"/>about transmitting that copy of the Novel to Goethe in Germany; but Whittaker was absent, and his clerks, ugly gaping Cockneys, made such foolish staring when I mentioned the affair, and talked so offensively about &#x201C;Gothy&#x201D; while consulting together, that I made an abrupt retreat, and have never yet fulfilled my purpose of returning. I got the book sent off by another hand; I suppose it is now far on its journey to <hi rend="italic">Weimar</hi>.</p>
<p>Since I arrived in London some change has taken place in my affairs: I do not go to France, as I partly anticipated; for some time I am like to be a little unsettled in my movements and proceedings. My friends here are full of compliments about the success &#x26;c of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>; many of them are advising me (with Mr Blackwood) to go on in translating German works, as a province of literature at once unoccupied and likely to be profitable as well as instructive. Their persuasions, aided by my own judgement of the case, have so far prevailed upon me that I now write to consult <hi rend="italic">you</hi> upon the subject; conceiving myself bound to take your advice at least in a part of my project before proceeding any farther with it. The <hi rend="italic">part</hi> I allude to is an idea I have long had of translating a <hi rend="italic">Continuation</hi> of our present work by Goethe, entitled <hi rend="italic">Meisters Wanderjahre</hi>, Meister&#x2019;s Travels (<hi rend="italic">Tramps</hi>hip as we should call it in Scotland), a book I think about half as large as the <hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship</hi>, and likely to be even more interesting, as it was written only two years ago, and after much controversy on the subject in Germany. What do you think of this? Procter (Barry Cornwall) has been very strenuously advising me to undertake a new version of <hi rend="italic">Werter</hi>: but to this I feel little call; tho&#x2019; Blackwood says it is better than <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, and would sell better. My own opinion on the first of these points is widely different. <hi rend="italic">Goethe&#x2019;s Life</hi> (for Colburn&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Colburn (d. <date when="1855">1855</date>), London publisher and founder of the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi>, published <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Goethe: Written by Himself</hi>, trans. from the French, 2 vols. (London, <date when="1824">1824</date>).</note> seems to be utterly and universally condemned) has also been passing thro&#x2019; my mind: I think it would make an excellent thing, only it would be rather long, its extent if I remember right being fully twice that of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>. There are also some things of <hi rend="italic">Paul Richter&#x2019;s</hi>: but concerning these I have yet come to no bearing. What I want of you is a decision about the first three. In regard to <hi rend="italic">Meisters Wanderjahre</hi> I shall treat with no one till I have heard from you: it properly forms part of the former work, and were much better to go along with it. In regard to <hi rend="italic">Werter</hi>, I have already hinted that unless you thought it likely to be very useful as a commercial speculation I <pb id="pg-03-103" n="03:103"/>have little care about it. As to the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> I confess my feeling that were it shorter it might please me (as well as the public) very much. I could also command <hi rend="italic">notes</hi> to it from Coleridge<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle may have been a trifle optimistic in assuming that he could &#x201C;command&#x201D; notes on a biography of Goethe from Coleridge, who did not respond very well to commands from the high or the low. Nevertheless, such a translation by Carlyle with Coleridge&#x2019;s notes would have been a thing to see, and we can only regret that it did not come into being.</note> if necessary; and from another gentleman<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Henry Crabb Robinson.</note> personally known to Goethe, and familiar with all the late literary history of Germany as of England. This I think would be a[n] advantage. What do you say?</p>
<p>I am going out of town shortly, and I want to have thi<supplied>[s]</supplied> aff<supplied>[air]</supplied> arranged before I go. For the next month or six weeks it is likely I shall be in Warwickshire; I expect to set out in a week, and I wish therefore to hear from you as speedily as possible. Let me beg of you accordingly to give the matter a few hours&#x2019; consideration, and let me have your thoughts on it directly. Tell me also how <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Novel <hi rend="italic">is</hi> coming on. People here praise and praise it, but I suppose it is out of flattery to me. How do you and sheriff Whittaker feel in regard to it? Whittaker told a friend of mine that it was meeting with a very quick sale; but you Bibliopolists are such a slippery race of mortals, there is no knowing what to make of you.&#x2014; Hoping for a speedy answer, I remain,</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I suppose you are not expecting to hear from me so soon again, and still less to hear the news I have got to tell you. The last letter was dated from Kew Green; there will no more of mine be dated there: last time, I was complaining of the irresolute and foolish fluctuations of the Bullers; I shall never more have reason to complain of their proceedings, I am now free of them forever and a day. I mentioned the <pb id="pg-03-104" n="03:104"/>correspondence which had taken place between the &#x201C;fair Titania&#x201D; (as the Calcutta Newspapers called her) and myself on the subject of her hopeful son; and how it was arranged that we should live together till october, and then <hi rend="italic">see</hi> about proceeding to Boulogne in France or else abandoning our present engagement altogether. The shifting and trotting about, which she managed with so total a disregard to my feelings, joined to the cold and selfish style of the Lady&#x2019;s general proceedings had a good deal disaffected me; and when in addition to all this I reflected that nothing permanent could result from my engagement with them; and considered the horrid weariness of living in seclusion from all sense and seriousness in the midst of sickness on my own part mingled with frivolity and heartless dissipation on theirs,&#x2014; I had well nigh silently determined <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to go to Boulogne, or even to stay with the people tho&#x2019; they remained in England. My determination was called for sooner than I had anticipated. After a week spent at Kew, in the most entire tedium, by which my health had begun to deteriorate rapidly, but which I determined to undergo without repining till October, Mrs Buller writes me a letter signifying that they must know <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> whether I could go to France with them or not; that if I could not the Boy might be sent to prepare for Cambridge, and that if I could, we must instantly decamp for Royston a place in Hertfordshire about fifty miles off! I replied that the expected period for deciding was not yet arrived, but that if they required an immediate decision of course there was nothing for it but to count on my declining the offer. Next day we met in Town by appointment; there seemed to be the best understanding in the world betwixt us; it was agreed that I should quit them&#x2014;an arrangement not a little grievous to old Buller &#x26; his son, but nowise grievous to his wife, one of whose whims was Cambridge University; in which whim so long as she persists, she will be ready to stake her whole soul on the fulfilment of it. Buller offered me twenty-pounds for my trouble; with an excess of generosity, which I am not quite reconciled to since I thought of it maturely, I pronounced it to be too much, and accepted of <hi rend="italic">ten</hi>. The old gentleman and I shook hands with dry eyes; Mrs B. gave me one of those &#x201C;good mornings&#x201D; with which fashionable people think it right to part with friends and foes alike; Charlie was in a passion of sadness and anger&#x2014;to be forgotten utterly in three hours; and I went my way and they saw me no more. Such is my conclusion with the Bullers. I feel glad that I have done with them; their family was ruining my mind and body; I was selling the very quintessence of my spirit for two hundred <pb id="pg-03-105" n="03:105"/>pounds a year. Twelve months spent at Boulogne in the midst of drivelling and discomfort would have added little to my stock of cash, and fearfully diminished my remnant of spirits, health, and affection. The world must be fronted sometime; soon as good as <foreign><hi rend="italic">syne</hi></foreign> [late]! <foreign>Adieu</foreign> therefore to ancient dames of quality, that flaunting, painting, patching, nervous, vapourish, jigging, skimming scolding race of mortals! Their clothes are silk, their manners courtly, their hearts are <hi rend="italic">kipper</hi>. I have left the Bullers twelve months sooner than they would have parted with me had I liked: I am glad that we have parted in friendship, very glad that we are parted at all. She invited me to a <hi rend="italic">rout</hi> (a grand fashionable affair) next night! I did not go a foot-length. I want to have no farther trade with her or hers&#x2014;at least except in the way of cold civility; for as to what <hi rend="italic">affection</hi> means, I do not believe there is one of them that even guesses what it means. Her sister indeed likes me, and I like her&#x2014;but she is opposite as day from night.</p>
<p>Thus you see, my dear Mother, I am as it were once more upon the waters. I got my trunks hither last night&#x2014;after having kept them just <hi rend="italic">one week</hi> at Kew&#x2014;and paid fourteen shillings for the trip to and fro&#x2014;so much for having a spirited commander like Titania! I am settled with Irving who presses me to stay with him all winter! That I certainly will not do, tho&#x2019; I honour the kindness that prompts even an <hi rend="italic">invitation</hi> of that sort. Irving &#x26; I are grown very intimate again, and have had great talking-matches about many things. He speaks in glorious language of the wonderful things I am to accomplish here; but my own views are much more moderate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile my dear Mother let me assure you that I have not been so happy for a long while. I am at no loss for plans of proceeding, nor is the future overcast before me with any heavy clouds, that I should fret or fear. I am once more free; and I must be a weak genius indeed if I cannot find an honest living in the exercise of my faculties, independently of favour from any one.</p>
<p>My movements for a while must be rather desultory. My first is to the northward. Among the worthy persons whom I have met with here is a Mr Beddomes,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Badams. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240625-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1824-06-25">25 June 1824</date></ref>.</note> a friend of Irvings, a graduate in medicine tho&#x2019; his business is in chemical manufactories at Birmingham, where I understand he is rapidly realizing a fortune. This man one of the most sensible clear-headed persons I have ever met with seems also one of the kindest. After going about together for a day or two, talking about pictures, and stomach-disorders in the cure of which he is <pb id="pg-03-106" n="03:106"/>famous, and from which he once suffered four years of torment in person&#x2014;what does the man do but propose that I should go up to Birmingham, and live a month with him that he might find out the make of me, and prescribe for my unfortunate inner man! This in a style of frankness which left me no doubt of its being really intended for use not show. I have consented to go with him; and we are to set out either together or not as I think proper in a few days. I understand he keeps horses &#x26;c, and is really the frank hospitable fellow he seems. Of his skill in medicine I augur favourably from his general talent, and from the utter contempt in which he holds all sorts of drugs as applied to persons in my situation. Regimen and exercise are his specifics assisted by as little gentlest medicine as possible. On the whole I think I never had such a chance for the recovery of health, and I am glad indeed that it has been put within reach of my acceptance. I intend to set off in about a week; there is a fine coach that starts from our very door and carries one up between 7 in the morning and seven at night&#x2014;for one guinea. Beddomes a bachelor about 35 years of age determines that I shall live in his house and be always under his eye: he means to treat me with fish and wine and strong drink, and then with gruels and syllabubs, that he may see what it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> that ails me. I am going to take books, and read and ride or stroll about Birmingham, and employ or amuse myself as seemeth best. Sometimes I think of beginning another translation, sometimes of setting about some original work. I am already acquainted with several literary people here, whose acquaintance would be a great comfort and some assistance to me in a case of that kind. Meantime I have set Procter (a poet of the place, whom Jack knows by the name of Barry Cornwall) to inquire among the Booksellers here and see whether any of them want such a thing as a translation from the German of any thing I should like; and I have written to <hi rend="italic">Bide</hi> (Boyd) yesterday sounding him on the subject. I expect his answer in a week: and I care very little whether he deny me or not. For you must know I have resources in abundance independently of him. <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, I understand, is doing very well; and I am not without some hopes of a second edition ere long. I rejoice more and more in the dexterity of my bargain. There was a review of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> in Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine: they speak very kindly of me as a translator, and call upon me to translate a multitude of other things which they name. In short, I am provided with abundant resources, and do not think there is any fear of me.</p>
<p>When I arrive in Birmingham, and sooner if any great delay occur, <pb id="pg-03-107" n="03:107"/>that is about ten days hence I will write to you again, and explain matters more minutely. I long earnestly to hear of you all; Jack&#x2019;s letter was a treat in itself, but it only increased my appetite for more. Let me still hope that you are all well! There is no earthly wish so near my heart. Jack tells me <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are reading <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>: this surprises me; if I did not recollect your love for me, I should not be able to account for it. <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x2019;s Life</hi> is in part printed: I expect to see it wholly next month. I have still some thoughts of putting it forth as a book. But the bookseller lives at such a distance that I very seldom see him, indeed have only seen him once since I arrived. When I send you <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, you will be better satisfied.</p>
<p>Now you must tell my dear Tongleg to write diligently, commanding Alick also to aid him. Did I not send them their fill of letters last week? I shall be obliged to be more brief in time to come, for this is among the last franks I shall get from Buller.</p>
<p>But, my dear Mother, are you well? I can only silently hope that you are; and earnestly conjure you to take care of your health as the most precious thing in your possession&#x2014;precious not to yourself alone, but still more precious to me. Oh my dear M<supplied>[other,]</supplied> what would become of us, if we had to part forever? But we a<supplied>[re]</supplied> in the hands of a good Father; surely He will have mercy on his creatures.&#x2014; Remember me to my good Mag: her figure that night before I went away is yet present to me. Tell her how much I think of her conduct and character and what affection I bear her. Mary also! poor Mall, she is a true-hearted <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ettercap</hi></foreign> [spider or ant: little creature] of a body&#x2014;and I like her wholly. Are Jane and Jenny still studying with Mister Rae? Tell them to be diligent while time is. My kindest affection to my Father and the rest of my faithful brothers. Let me hear of them all, all! May God keep them and restore them all to me! With you of Mainhill&#x2014;hearts so honest and so faithful, I am rich, betide what will. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Mother! I am ever your affectionate Son,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have revise<supplied>[d]</supplied> the proof of <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>, and send it to you according to promise. Could you get me the remainder one of these days, it <pb id="pg-03-109" n="03:109"/>would be particularly convenient: I expect to leave Town before the end of the week.</p>
<p>Respecting the publication of this <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> as a separate book, I wish to get some more definite ideas from you before my departure.

Bohte<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably J. H. Bohte, publisher and compiler of numerous catalogues of Greek, Latin, German, and English books.</note> seems a very civil person, and I doubt not will exert himself in the matter. Other works pertaining to the subject I hope I shall be able to collect by my own efforts.</p>
<p>In the mean time, while these things are in progress would you be so good as let me know on what footing I stand with you at present in regard to <hi rend="italic">Schillers Life</hi>, and on what terms you are willing to make a separate publication of it. With respect to the latter point, I may state as a preliminary that I feel averse to publishing on the scheme of what is called <hi rend="italic">Half profits</hi>, or to part with the <hi rend="italic">copyright</hi> of the Book, however trivial it may be. I wish therefore you would say how much you can afford to give me for <hi rend="italic">an edition</hi>&#x2014;of 1000 copies or whatever number you like&#x2014;free of all drawbacks and contingencies, to be paid or at least liquidated on the day of publication. The Book might have a portrait of Schiller: if augmented and put into shape, I think it might find a certain degree of circulation. The sooner you can let me hear of this, the better: I must have some arrangement on the subject before leaving town, and my time is now very limited. Bohte&#x2019;s books, in case we need them, may be transmitted afterwards.&#x2014; In great haste,</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I daresay you are already full of various anxieties on my account; and for that reason I am anxious to let no day slip till I have satisfied you about my history and welfare. The last bundle of letters would inform you of my having parted with the Bullers, and my purpose of coming hither to be doctored: two days ago I accomplished that determination; and tho&#x2019; scarcely settled in my place yet, or fully acquainted with the <hi rend="italic">lye</hi> of things about me, I cannot wait another post to tell you that I am well and all your motherly anxieties are superfluous.</p>
<p>Strange and inconsiderate as the conduct of the Bullers and my connexion with them has been, I cannot feel sorry that it brought me to the south: I feel that I shall learn much here, and gain much. I have already found several worthy characters whose friendship I design to cultivate, and who seem desirous of cultivating mine. Much also may be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> as well as enjoyed in this part: I have even hopes of getting back my health! But I must tell you every thing in order.</p>
<p>Directly after parting with my very noble and approved good masters, I set about considering what in my then state of entire freedom was to be made of my most precious self. That I should go to Birmingham to the care of Badams was already determined: but it struck me that some <hi rend="italic">work</hi> to occupy my leisure hours, and keep my hand in use, after my return would be of essential service to me. I went among such booksellers, therefore, as I had access to, and sounded them on various topics. Boyd I told you I had written to on the subject of a translation: he answered my letter by return of post offering willingly enough to publish the continuation of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, on condition (the Turk!) that I would take a certain sum and make it <hi rend="italic">his</hi>. This I shall hardly do, tho&#x2019; as yet I have not told him so. In the meanwhile, however, Tayler &#x26; Hessey had suggested the propriety of publishing the <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> in a separate form, a proposal to which I readily acceded, requesting only that they would specify some rational terms on which I might proceed. They seemed to require time; and I applied in the interim to Whittaker (the publisher of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, a heathen of the city, but a great seller of books), who also required time, but seemed to bite more readily at the ware. Both of these <pb id="pg-03-111" n="03:111"/>&#x201C;base Phrygian Turks&#x201D; wanted to publish on the scheme of <hi rend="italic">half-profits</hi>, a scheme which honest Collins<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Collins (<date when="1789">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853">1853</date>), founder, in <date when="1819">1819</date>, of Collins&#x2019; publishing firm; an Evangelical, he published both Irving and Chalmers. See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 170&#x2013;71, and David Keir, <hi rend="italic">The House of Collins</hi> (London, <date when="1952">1952</date>). For &#x201C;base Phrygian Turks,&#x201D; cf. <hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi>, I, iii.</note> of Glasgow forewarned me never by any chance to engage in. They are to write to me in a day or two. I expect to get some &#xa3;90&#x2014;or so (including the magazine fee) for this book: it is to be enlarged with various translations &#x26;c &#x26;c: I will send you a copy in a few months. The booksellers whenever they agree with me will send me up German books &#x26;c such as I need: I expect to have the business done before leaving Birmingham.</p>
<p>The arranging of all that took up more time than I anticipated. The kindness of some good friends detained me still farther. Irving and I are as great as ever. He is in feebler health, and much more pleasant every way than he was. His Mrs Montague also rather gains on me than loses: I seem to stand very well with her. She would have me to come and stay at her house when I returned to London, and seemed mortified when I declined. But my chief favourite is Mrs Strachey, a sister of Mrs Buller&#x2019;s, but different as day from night. She is serious and earnest and religious and affectionate, while the other is light giddy vain and heartless. She and I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be sworn friends by and by. I was out at Shooter&#x2019;s Hill where she lives in summer, for two days, and we had much pleasant conversation with each other and her husband, who is in the India House a man of birth and fortune but simple and playful as a child and liberal and clever in all his opinions and pretensions.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Carlyle on the Stracheys, see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences, passim</hi>.</note> On returning from her house last Thursday evening, whom should I find waiting for me in Irving&#x2019;s but my good old friend and trusty countryman&#x2014;the Targer!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Johnston.</note> There was he sitting with his angular, meek, true-hearted countenance, after travelling all the way from Brighton the day before, and with the purpose of setting out next morning for Southhampton<supplied>[.]</supplied> He staid with us all night, and I walked with him in the morning to Lad Lane, and saw him mounted on the &#x201C;leathern conveniency&#x201D; after many mutual engagements to remember and to write to one another.&#x2014; As last of Saturday I was ready for departure hither: but the coach being full, I was forced to wait a day, and (as Mrs Martin and daughter had arrived from Kir<supplied>[kcaldy]</supplied> to superintend Mrs I&#x2019;s. lying-in<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving writes to Carlyle on <date when="1824-07-22">22 July</date> to announce the birth of his son Edward.</note>&#x2014;as I observe) I could <pb id="pg-03-112" n="03:112"/>wait <hi rend="italic">but</hi> a day<supplied>[. Our]</supplied> ride of 120 miles thro&#x2019; a lovely <hi rend="italic">English</hi> country was performed without accident or particular discomfort: we drove like Jehu,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At a furious pace. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170705-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1817-07-05">5 July 1817</date></ref>.</note> and were here at seven o&#x2019;clock in the evening after a ride of twelve hours including every stoppage. Badams received me as if I had been an acquaintance of twenty years standing: he has given me a room in his house; he feeds me, and takes me out to ride, and leads me and guides me in every thing, declaring that he will refit me altogether by and by. His plan includes nothing but diet and exercise: he is trying me with wine <hi rend="italic">before</hi> dinner, with soft eggs and tea &#x26;c &#x26;c till he discovers what it is that ails me. I do think there is some hope of my getting better: at last it well deserves a trial. There is something so eminently <hi rend="italic">un-Scotch</hi> in all this project that I scarce know what to make of it. Badams and I are already familiar as household friends. I find him to be a very singular character. He is scarcely older than myself, yet he has already by his chemical inventions and speculations made and lost <hi rend="italic">two</hi> fortunes. He has plans on the anvil more gigantic than those perhaps of any man in Britain. Yet withal he is a modest careless good-hearted fellow; full of taste for poetry and painting and even riding and hunting. What I like in him most is the love he bears his mother: she lives at Warwick supported with her daughters by his bounty on the most liberal terms. He is a man of sound sense, I think, with all his schemes; and what is to me most important, he has cured himself and many other obstinate <hi rend="italic">dyspeptics</hi> of all their ailments. I hope he will succeed. At all events I cannot but be happy for a while: he means to show me many things and persons: I have several letters from Irving; and this city of Smiths has many curious things in it which I must see. Of <hi rend="italic">Brummagem</hi> (as they call it) I will not say a word at present, and for obvious reasons.&#x2014; Now my dear Mother, when, when shall I hear of you? Are you well and contented? My thoughts are daily with you as yours are with me. Bid Jack write the <hi rend="italic">moment</hi> he gets this. Give the warmest love of my heart to all at Mainhill.

<p><salute>Dearest&#x2014;</salute> Were I not morally certain that you cannot send me a letter till you have got one from me, I doubt if I should even yet muster spirits enough to write three lines which you could endure to read. Mortal was scarcely ever shook and swept and shovelled to and fro at this rate since the Deluge of Noah. My ideas cannot rest, for nothing about me or my fortunes rests. The Wandering Jew or Shoemaker of Jerusalem was but a type of me. From day to day my scene changes, my companions change, my hopes, my fears; nothing stays with me but my old friends Disease and Tedium-<foreign>vitae</foreign>, kind followers,that at a closer or a wider distance never fail to trace my footsteps, turn me whither I may.</p>
<p>Well here I am in <hi rend="italic">Brummagem</hi>, the City of Smiths, among a thousand steam engines, and pestiferous magazines of vitriol and copperas, and socinianism and bacon-grease! What has brought me hither, and will keep me for a month? I declare I almost cease to be surprised or anxious about any thing; by and by I fancy I shall reach the enviable quietism of</p>

We parted good friends, as I positively declined accompanying them to France, and myself advised the sending of their son to Cambridge instantly. Mrs Buller cannot now shift my residence and plague me with the consequences of her ignorant caprice from week to week; the dead-hearted fashionable frivolity of her and hers are now their own concern: I am a free man; let any arid, gaudy, drivelling male or female dandy come within wind of me to fret me and disgust me with their inanities if they dare! After parting with the Bullers, which I did with a certain placid contempt for their judgements and still more their hearts, wishing at the same time that abundance of live partridges and routs and Rowland&#x2019;s oil<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The name of a specific brand of Macassar oil, hair oil, sold by Rowland and Son, well known in the early nineteenth century.

Cf. Byron&#x2019;s apostrophe to &#x201C;thine &#x2018;incomparable oil,&#x2019; Macassar!&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Don Juan</hi>, I, 17).</note> for the supply of their several wants might be ministered unto them, and they might love me as they could, I turned round to the friendly threshold of the Orator to meditate on what tack I should now steer, now that I had parted convoy, and meant to sail by my own card. The presence of a certain John Badams of Birmingham coupled with the condition of my thrice blessed clay decided my first movement. Badams, whom I had seen and talked with largely by the intervention of the helpful Mrs Montagu, impressed me deeply with a feeling of his original, just and strong intellect, and his honest frank affectionate mind. He is a connoisseur in pictures and sciences; was bred a physician, but has relinquished the practice of his art in favour of chemistry, in which I understand him to be possessed of secrets that have already realized many thousands for him, and may yet realize him millions. He promised to cure me of dyspepsia, or at least alleviate my curse! He invited me to spend six weeks in his house, under his constant care, till he saw how matters stood with me; and here I am! There is something strange in all this to me; something eminently alien to my Scottish habits. Badams and I have but been <pb id="pg-03-115" n="03:115"/>together three days; yet we are as acquaintances of twenty years&#x2019; standing. We have argued and talked about two folio volumes: I feel as if half the house were mine. Whether he will do me any good I know not; in the mean time, he is very diligent in taking me to ride and see company, in feeding me with half raw eggs and floods of tea, and wine <hi rend="italic">before</hi> dinner, and many other items, in sending me to sleep, and rousing me, and driving me in short thro&#x2019; all the training by which he has already cured some half dozen hopeless stomachists, and among others raised himself from a state which he says for four years was worse than mine into a condition of health superior to that of Thomas Crib<supplied>[b]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Famous pugilist (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">1848</date>), champion in <date when="1808">1808</date>.

See <ref target="volume-03/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6692"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>.</note> himself. However it may be, I purpose to enjoy myself for some time, among the originals of <hi rend="italic">Brummagem</hi>, of which there seem to be several; in visiting Kenilworth and Warwick and Stratford and Lichfield and the Leasowes; and meditating what is next to be done when I return to London, whither I am bound again at least for a season, so soon as I depart. Some little business I have already on hand: the <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> increased by new translations and enlargements is to be published as a separate book&#x2014;tho&#x2019; whether by Taylor or Whittaker is not quite settled&#x2014;and I am to get it ready while here. Afterwards, I doubt not, there will be work enough; and in London there are many characters whom it will do my heart and my understanding good to study. Oh how I have wished that you were there; among kindred people, women and men that would appreciate and instruct you; that your high and gifted soul might no longer waste itself in ill-directed efforts, that its affections might no longer be checked and wasted in the barren clime of Haddington! My best Jane! words are feeble to express the anxieties I sometimes feel on your account. Your spirit is the noblest I have <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> found among women; and you are still uninstructed, even unconvinced of your highest duties, your destiny still lies before you void and formless as my own. Will you waste such endowments as Nature bestows only on her favourites, one among many millions? Will you not rather up and be doing; summon all your soul and strength and mind to <supplied>[res]</supplied>ist the evil influences of your situation and to forward the good? <supplied>[I]</supplied> swear you <supplied>[shall yet]</supplied> be worthy of yourself: and I shall rejoice that I ever saw <supplied>[you.]</supplied> But Oh the difficulties, the mistakes, the wanderings! Sometimes tears half force their way into my eyes when I think of you. I speak this as a brother, I might almost say as a guardian spirit. <pb id="pg-03-116" n="03:116"/>God only knows how it may be: sometimes I hope all, sometimes I fear all. One thing you must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> do;&#x2014;forget or separate yourself from me, unworthy as I am, till you have found some worthier. It is through me that you hold some intercourse with that ideal world towards which your inmost nature has always striven: of my feelings towards <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in my better moments I am proud. &#x201C;But whither all this?&#x201D; you cry: &#x201C;is the unhappy youth gone crazy?&#x201D; Do not say so: these things deserve the earnest solemn consideration of us both. Also I still hope to see you in London! The Orator blushed like scarlet, when I hinted to him that your Mother and you felt offended with him: I have promised to mediate and procure his forgivenness. Depend upon it he loves you better than almost any one but I and your Mother. He still counts on seeing you. Do forgive him, and procure his pardon from your Mother, <hi rend="italic">for my sake</hi>. The man has many follies, but there is true blood in his heart. He is infinitely more reasonable than when you saw him; his health is feebler, the hacks of quality have nearly altogether left him, he is Edward Irving once more. Will you forgive him, then, my <foreign><hi rend="italic">Liebling</hi></foreign>? A heart with any touch of genuine love in it is precious as diamonds in this world of selfishness and empty cant&#x2014; Also will my own <foreign>lassie</foreign> write to me without a day&#x2019;s delay? Will she? I know I do not deserve it; but I also know your goodness and tenderness; you will remember how I have been, and how I am. The first hour you can spare you will remember me in merciful forgivenness. <closer><salute>Write, write; <foreign><hi rend="italic">meine ewig Liebste, lebe wohl</hi></foreign> [my dearest one always, farewell]!

<ps><p>Tell me has your Mother ceased to like me? I hope she never will, I sometimes feel as if she never ought. Irving will have it, you and she should come and live in London. Will you, will she?

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am daily expecting a letter from you on the subject of the <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi>. I have got a copy of his Works beside me, which I have been glancing over; and I feel anxious to commence the business of remoulding and enlarging, in due form. As you already know the qualities and probable size of the Book, I need not recur to those topics. With a handsome portrait of Schiller, the whole would form a pretty enough volume, a thousand copies of which I should think might sell with tolerable rapidity, at some price between 7 / and 10. These points, however, would be left entirely to your own arrangement, as the bargain I wish to make would refer only to the net value (if any) of a single edition. Some friends have mentioned sixty pounds as a fair price from you for a thousand copies: but in this matter I cannot dictate, and feel reluctant even to propose. I wish only to have your own voice in regard to it as speedily as possible. Will you be kind enough to let me hear from you in a day or two?</p>
<p>This morning I recieved a copy of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</hi> (Travels), a sort of sequel to <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi>, which is at present stealing into what notice it can attain among you. The <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi> was written two years ago by Goethe, and promises so far as I can yet judge to be a very special work. I am not without some serious thoughts of putting it into an English dress to follow its elder brother. I expect very shortly to hear of a second edition of the <hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship</hi>, and the Edinburgh Bookseller offers me terms for the <pb id="pg-03-118" n="03:118"/><hi rend="italic">Travels</hi>; but for several reasons I had rather publish in London. Does this sort of ware suit you at all? I wish you would consider of it, and let me know. Meantime you will not, of course, speak of it beyond what may be necessary.</p>
<p>On this subject I shall be glad to hear from you at any time: on the subject of <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> I hope to hear from you very soon.</p>
<p>Believe me always,</p>

<p>I am extremely sorry to learn that Mr Taylor has so excellent an excuse for his delay in writing. I trust his disorder is now completely gone; and that by operating as a persuasive to greater caution in future, its temporary presence may prove a benefit to him.</p>
<p>I have determined on accepting your offer with regard to Schiller: there is a Letter inclosed, which if you will copy and signify you<supplied>[r]</supplied> agreement with, in a sheet directed to me, our little bargain will be struck.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See enclosed letter, <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240806-TC-TAHE-01">TC to TAHE, <date when="1824-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref>, which follows.</note></p>
<p>As for the books I must beg of you to make what exertions you can with Bohte<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240712-TC-JTA-01">TC to <sic>JT</sic><corr>JTA</corr>, <date when="1824-07-12">12 July</date></ref>.</note> or any other person likely to be of service in that matter. I feel anxious to make the account of Schiller and his times much more complete than it is at present, and materials are sadly wanting. I have two <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi> of him in my possession; but they are excessively meagre. From Bohte I doubt not you will be able to procure <hi rend="italic">Schillers Letters to Dalberg, Joerdens poetical Lexicon (art. Schiller</hi>), and <hi rend="italic">Grubers Wieland</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> vol. Tell him also to look at the List in the end of <hi rend="italic">Doering&#x2019;s Schiller</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240712-TC-HCR-01">TC to HCR, <date when="1824-07-12">12 July</date></ref>.</note> and send me any or all of the works mentioned there which he can procure. I fear he has none of them: nor is it of essential consequence. If any other of your friends can suggest help or sources of help I shall be happy to receive it.&#x2014; Along with these books, or as many of them as can be had, I must also <pb id="pg-03-119" n="03:119"/>request of you a copy of the whole <hi rend="italic">Article</hi>, no part of which is at present in my possession. If interleaved with white paper, it would be so much the better: but neither is this essential.</p>
<p>In all this I could wish as much despatch as possible, being anxious to have the matter off my hands. My movements for a month or two are not strictly calculable: but I hope we shall be able to have out our Volume in November. I hope also you will put it in a decent dress as to paper and typography; and let us have a handsome portrait in front. A vignette representing his monument or tomb would look well upon the titlepage, but I know not whether it can easily be had.</p>
<p>Of all these points however we shall have time to consider more maturely: ere many weeks I hope to see you in Fleet-street and discuss them at large. Let me again beg of you to lose no time in sending out these Books; the Address is: Care of J. Badams Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, Birmingham.</p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Tho I have not been much hurried by positive business since receiving your welcome letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written in his letter of <date when="1824-07-26">26 July</date>: &#x201C;We are all decidedly of opinion that you acted very wisely in bidding <foreign>adieu</foreign> to that ancient dame of quality the fair Titania. Her whims were sufficient <supplied>[to]</supplied> drive any reasonable man to despair. Had you staid with the Bullers another year and submitted to all their arrangements and counterarrangements you would have had abundance of vexation and very likely have altogether lost your health. Now that you are without the reach of them and their plans you have a fair chance of improving your health, and even if money were your object there are many ways in which you might realize as much.&#x2014;&#x2014; I was highly amused with your graphic descriptions of Campbell and Coleridge. Our father was altogether charmed with your account of St Paul&#x2019;s. He did not believe there was a fellow in the British Empire could have given such a picture of it.&#x2014;&#x2014; To a Scotchman there is somewhat of the romantic in your present situation at Birmingham. All of us are in great hopes you will reap some advantage from the exercise and change of scene if not from the prescriptions of the Doctor.&#x201D;</note> and tho&#x2019; I purposed to answer it with very little delay, I find &#x201C;the three weeks&#x201D; are fast hastening to a close, and you no whit the wiser. I have taken up my pen to-day, to write to you and also to Alick. Letters to other quarters are likewise due; but yours are the most agreeable if not the most pressing debts; and I will pay them first.</p>
<p>Birmingham I have now tried for a reasonable time, and I cannot complain of being tired of it. As a town, it is pitiful enough; a mean congeries of bricks, including scarcely one or two large capitalists, some hundreds of minor ones, and perhaps a hundred and twenty <pb id="pg-03-121" n="03:121"/>thousand sooty artisans in metals &#x26; chemical produce. The streets are ill-built, ill-paved, always flimsy in their aspect, often poor, sometimes miserable. Not above one or two of them are paved with flag-stones at the sides; and to walk upon the little egg-shaped slippery flints that supply their place is something very like a pennance. Yet withal it is interesting, from some of the commons or lanes that spot or intersect the green woody undulating environs, to view this City of Tubalcain. Torrents of thick smoke with ever and anon a burst of dingy flame are issuing from a thousand funnels; &#x201C;a thousand hammers fall by turns on the red <supplied>[i]</supplied>ron of the furnace&#x201D;; you hear the clank of innumerable steam-engings, the rumbling of vans and cars and the hum of men, interrupted by the sharper rattle of some canal-boat loading or disloading, or perhaps some fierce explosion where the cannon-founders are proving their new-made ware. I have seen their rolling mills; their polishing of teapots and buttons and gunbarrels, and fire-shovels and swords, and all manner of toys and tackle; I have looked into their iron-works (where 150,000 men are smelting the metal, in a district a few miles to the north), their coal mines&#x2014;fit image of Avernus!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A deep lake near Puteoli, Italy, filling the crater of an extinct volcano, and often spoken of by ancient writers as leading to the underworld.</note>&#x2014;their tubs and vats (as large as country-churches) full of copperas and aquafortis and oil of vitriol; and the whole is not without its attractions as well as repulsions, of which when we meet I will preach to you at large. But one&#x2019;s comfort as you know depends not much on brick and mortar, or the outward figure of a town; and even of this I am pretty independent. Badams lives in the north-east verge of the place, close upon the country; and his frank easy honest manners would make a smoky alley pleasant. I feel as much at home as if I had lived with him for years. He still predicts the reestablishment of my health; and tho&#x2019; the whole or very nearly the whole of this thrice blessed change is still in prospect, I am not without hopes of its being ultimately realized. As yet indeed there has been no fair chance: he has been dosing me considerably with drugs vegetable and saline; trying me on various tacks, to see where lies the rotten plank in this fabric, before attempting to repair it. By this means I am weak, but not very wretched in my carcass; and most frequently anticipating an improvement. On the whole, I am not unhappy&#x2014;in my own peculiar way; when the infernal genius of Pain retires but a few steps from me, there is a quiet island of beatitude far in the distance, a little oasis among the &#x201C;burning marle&#x201D; of my internal world, to which <pb id="pg-03-122" n="03:122"/>I hasten, and where I live among bright tho&#x2019; chequered scenes, not without images and hopes of a stern beauty, radiant tho&#x2019; sobered by a cast of sadness. Such resting finds the sole of unblest feet! If I live and regain any portion of my strength I will tell the Earth these things: if not, <foreign><hi rend="italic">n&#x2019;importe</hi></foreign>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I pass my days in a quiet enough style: I read Scotch novels, biographies and all sorts of insipid trash: Badams talks sense and nonsense to me; I ride and dream and sleep. After much delay I have agreed to publish <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> with Taylor (for the additional sum of &#xa3; 50) and henceforth I am to be partially engaged with translating scenes of plays, with altering and arranging, to get the book ready against November. It is to have a portrait; I design to make considerable additions; and the thing I expect will live its three months creditably enough among the other lumber of the time. Of course I will send a copy to Kirkchrist whenever it is ready.</p>
<p>I need not say, my good Jack, how glad I am that you proceed with unabated spirit in your studies, and of course with corresponding success. I feel more and more persuaded that there never was greater room for an accomplished philosophical physician than at present. It is fallen into the hands of quacks and drivellers: a man of a true head and heart may aim at the very top of his profession, without presumption. Badams promised to give me a list of books for you to read, but to-day he has not time. He seems to recommend a thorough knowledge of chemistry and anatomy; then a general knowledge of the modern practice of physic (such as you may get from Good); and then that you should study medicine historically&#x2014;that is in the writings of Boerhaave, Sydenham,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Boerhaave and Sydenham, see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240918-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1824-09-18">18 Sept.</date></ref></note> &#x26;c &#x26;c, and so get out of those technical trammels in which our friend maintains the medical world to be totally bound at present, and reduced to little more than the rank of mere tradesmen working by prescribed formulae of which they know not soundly either the whence or the why. There seems to me some truth in this: I will make the man tell me something more precise about it, and communicate to you in due time. For the rest, you do well to fill your mind with general knowledge, while you have it in your power. Continue to study Greek, as an accomplishment at once distinguishing and truly valuabl<supplied>[e.]</supplied> The Greeks are <supplied>[in]</supplied> some respects the fountains of good taste even in our modern literature; par<supplied>[tly]</supplied> because they <hi rend="italic">were</hi> men of finer organs than we rude Saxons, partly because we <hi rend="italic">learned</hi> from them. This you will see more clearly <pb id="pg-03-123" n="03:123"/>as you advance. Mind German too: it is growing more important every day. Are you sure you know enough of natural philosophy; mechanics, astronomy? I doubt it: if you could get some treatise such as Nicholson&#x2019;s or Cavallo&#x2019;s,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tiberius Cavallo (<date when="1749">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1809">1809</date>), author of <hi rend="italic">Elements of Natural and Experimental Philosophy</hi>, 4 vols. (<date when="1803">1803</date>), and other books on physics; William Nicholson (<date when="1753">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1815">1815</date>), author of <hi rend="italic">Introduction to Natural Philosophy</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1781">1781</date>).</note> or some of the more modern French ones (see Waugh on these), or even the various articles on these subjects in the Encyclopedia Britannica with the Supplement, which would perhaps answer you better than aught else, I could like well enough to hear of your devoting some attention to them. Tell me what you think of this. The Supplement of the Encycl. is a very superior performance. I wish you knew Astronomy. Paley, as you say, is clear; but clear because it is shallow. I do and must call Marcus Brutus a more virtuous man than James Watt of Soho near <hi rend="italic">Brummagem</hi>, come of it what will: yet for its <hi rend="italic">utility</hi> the steam-engine was worth five hundred deaths of Caesar. Utility is in fact a dead matter, so far as I can see: it came into vogue with the French Revolution and lingers only in the heads of the Political Economists and Editors of Whig newspapers. I believed in it for three months. Have you read Stewart&#x2019;s Essays?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dugald Stewart&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Essays</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1810">1810</date>).</note> You will find them useful and beautiful&#x2014;as well as all his writings&#x2014;saving the outlines which are a meagre class-book. Have you perused Locke and Reid&#x2019;s works? Or if you feel indisposed to these things, what say you to a thorough set-to on the History of Greece? Mitford is the man&#x2014;or Gillies.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For William Mitford and John Gillies, see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230112-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-01-12">12 Jan. 1823</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220623-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1822-06-23">23 June 1822</date></ref>.</note> With a set of Ancient maps you will soon master it: then the Roman; then Gibbon. Here is for you, boy! Cut and dry! I know your diligence: I expect much of you, and so task you heavily.</p>
<p>Now Jack you must write to me directly as usual. Are you happy at Kirkchrist? I advise you to take a spell of it for a week or two longer. How are all your worthy hosts? Present my kindest love to them, not forgetting Duncan,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duncan Church, John&#x2019;s roommate in Edinburgh, in whose father&#x2019;s home he is visiting.</note> and Mazeppa.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a person or horse with a name or nickname suggested by Byron&#x2019;s poem.</note> Is Mitchell with you?

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I have just been writing Jack a letter; and lest our kind mother should be getting anxious about me, I have determined on sending you one also, while my hand is in. Jack&#x2019;s letter and your newspapers have found me here in due course of post, and comforted me with the intelligence that you are all in your usual way: I am happy to inform you in my turn that I also am as formerly, if little better, at least nothing worse. Jack gives me sundry articles of news; but he neglects to say whether ever that weighty packet of letters from London, directed to my Mother, reached you, with the two <hi rend="italic">Examiners</hi> that followed it. The packet contained a little sheet for you, and one for Frank Dickson: I think there can be no doubt that it would arrive in safety, tho&#x2019; it was put into the post-office in a somewhat irregular manner. Satisfy me, if you can recollect.</p>
<p>Since coming hither I have followed Badams&#x2019; prescription with as much regularity as I conveniently could; but I do not find that I have yet made any very marked improvement. Indeed I can hardly expect it: he has had me under physic for the last fortnight, and tho&#x2019; in general a little easier than I used to be, I am just proportionally weaker. However, he predicts confidently an improvement or even a recovery, and I am content enough to abide the issue for a few weeks longer. My way of life has been a little irregular since my arrival, as my kind doctor has been trying a variety of experiments with me, to discover properly what it is that ails me. In general, I ride and read and talk, and pass the time with a sufficient allowance of comfort: all my views and hopes are directed towards the reestablishment of my <pb id="pg-03-125" n="03:125"/>health; without which I am but a lost man. Badams and I are sufficiently familiar: I feel entirely at home with him. Independently of his skill in medicine and other arts, I find him one of the most estimable men I have ever met with. In another month I shall know better what to say about his skill in stomach disorders: at present I have some faith, but not by any means complete. There are several other people here to whom he has introduced me; men of pleasing exterior, and not without a certain worth; but my taste is rather for private meditation and careless talk than for laborious conversation with such persons. Nevertheless I do stir out sometimes: to-day I am to go with one Crosbie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Geddes Crosbie (d. <date when="1838">1838</date>), eldest son of Andrew Crosbie, Dumfries. He was educated at Glasgow, on Irving&#x2019;s recommendation called to Scots Church, Birmingham, <date when="1824-11">Nov. 1824</date>, and ordained by the Glasgow presbytery in June of the following year. He served as minister of Fenwick from <date when="1829">1829</date> to <date when="1836">1836</date>, when he resigned on conscientious grounds.</note> (from Dumfries, a Scotch minister here) to dine at a Mr Lawrence&#x2019;s, to whom Irving sent a letter by me. I was one day thro the iron and coal works of this neighbourhood&#x2014;a half-frightful scene! A space perhaps 30 square miles to the north of us, covered over with furnaces, rolling-mills, steam-engines and sooty men. A dense cloud of pestilential smoke hangs over it forever, blackening even the grain that grows upon it; and at night the whole region burns like a volcano spitting fire from a thousand tubes of brick. But oh the wretched hundred and fifty thousand mortals that grind out their destiny there! In the coal-mines they were literally naked, many of them, all but trowsers; black as ravens; plashing about among dripping caverns, or scrambling amid heaps of broken mineral; and thirsting unquenchably for beer. In the iron-mills it was little better: blast-furnaces were roaring like the voice of many whirlwinds all around; the fiery metal was hissing thro&#x2019; its moulds, or sparkling and spitting under hammers of a monstrous size, which fell like so many little earthquakes. Here they were wheeling charred coals, breaking their iron-stone, and tumbling all into their fiery pit; there they were turning and boring cannon with a hideous shrieking noise such as the earth could hardly parallel; and thro&#x2019; the whole, half-naked demons pouring with sweat and besmeared with soot were hurrying to and fro in their red nightcaps and sheet-iron breeches rolling or hammering or squeezing their glowing metal as if it had been wax or dough. They also had a thirst for ale. Yet on the whole I am told they are very happy: they make forty shillings or more per week, and few of them will work on Mondays. It is in a spot like this that one sees the sources of British <pb id="pg-03-126" n="03:126"/>power. The skill of man combining these coals and that iron-ore (till forty years ago&#x2014;iron was smelted with charcoal only) has gathered three or four hundred thousand human beings round this spot, who send the products of their industry to all the ends of the Earth.</p>
<p>But I must close my descriptions of these indifferent matters, and travel towards home. What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> going on about Mainhill, my dear Boy? How do you fare, and what cheer are you of, since I went away? Do you ever think of farms, or hear of any? You must not give up your ideas on that point, tho&#x2019; I am out of the Buller family. I shall make money enough, if I were fairly on my feet again; I do not fear it; and unless my health improve a good deal there will be nothing for it, but to come and stay beside you somewhere, and mind my writing for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> as before. Be upon the look-out, therefore; and if any thing strike you let me know. Tell me also pointedly how our Mother is; and if she wants any thing. Thank her for her little letter, which I read with no usual feeling, and beg another from her. When were you at Dumfries, and how are Robie and our uncle John and Nancy<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Aitken of Dumfries, who would later assist in the repairs at Craigenputtoch. There is a letter from Carlyle to him published in Moncure D. Conway&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Thomas Carlyle</hi> (New York, <date when="1881">1881</date>), pp. 144&#x2013;45. Nancy Grierson is his mother&#x2019;s niece. Robie appears to be either a maternal uncle or cousin.</note> and all the rest? Remember me kindly to them when you have opportunity. How does our worthy Father like the aspect of affairs at Mainhill this autumn?

I expect to make somewhat not very far from &#xa3;100 of it, altogether. It is to be enlarged with new translations &#x26;c &#x26;c, and to have a portrait of Schiller at the beginning of it. I expect it will be a pretty enough volume. I am at present engaged in looking out for pieces to translate for it, and meditating improvements.

<p>But Badams is calling me to go out and ride; so I must draw this confused scribble to a close. Now remember you must write to me without delay.

Much too am I struck with that evidence of pure nature &#x26; simplicity that reigns throughout, for it is infinitely pleasing to find the man of Genius &#x26; the sage, without pedantry &#x26; affectation, Condescending to make himself intelligible to all Classes of his fellowmen. At the same time I perceive, that the sentiments of the book will not bear to be tried in every point by the principles of Morals which we esteem in this Country to be the most sound, and what is with me a matter of far greater moment, they do not appear to be always in harmony with the principles of the Gospel of Christ, but in spite of these objections I cannot help thinking, that as we do not always read with especial reference to the culture of pure religions &#x26; Moral feeling, so it is quite allowable to admire Wilhelm Meister &#x26; to do justice to its incomparable author for the sake of its many beauties &#x26; many intrinsic excellencies.&#x201D;</note> they are still reviewing it, some censuring, most praising. It must and will do.&#x2014; Write soon.</p></ps>

<p>Thou art indeed my guardian Spirit! my good Angel! Forget or separate myself from thee! that will I never while I retain my senses. Am I not bound to thee by a thousand obligations? Whom have I to direct me, to console and encourage me but only thee? Woe to me then if I let go thy helping hand, if I hearken to another voice than thine, my Brother, Protector Friend!</p>
<p>I have kept you waiting, but do not blame me. There has been such a tragedy performing here! and I could not think of writing till I saw the end of it. I declare one would need a heart of flint to bear a destiny like mine. I flattered myself that I should live <hi rend="italic">this</hi> summer in peace, and was resolved to turn it to some account; but alas! alas! &#x2018;man purposeth, God disposeth,&#x2019; my evil Genius has been at work again, and I am neither more happy nor more diligent this summer than I was the last.</p>
<p>The Devil put it in my head to go to Musselbro&#x2019; races<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Musselburgh is a small town just east of Edinburgh noted for its racecourse.</note>&#x2014; I had been ill of bile or vapours for a day or two before, and I imagined that amusement and exercise would do me good. It was the Devil too that tempted me to go on horse-back, by which means I drew a multitude of eyes on me&#x2014; Oh the folly of men! if I had written a book, or made the most delicious pudding in the world, they would not have admired me half as much, as for this idle display of my horsemanship and pretty riding-dress&#x2014; Can you believe it? one young gentleman (a Sutherlandman) fell in love with me in good earnest&#x2014;thro&#x2019; my veil too (Lord help his simplicity)&#x2014; He had been once in a room with me some <pb id="pg-03-129" n="03:129"/>eighteen months ago, on the strength of which acquaintance and of his quality he joined me on the race-ground; and from that hour till this he has been seldom from my side: in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> he haunted me wherever I turned myself, and before I had been at the Bridge of Earn two days, he was there also&#x2014;there was no escaping his ubiquity&#x2014; During the time which we spent together at that disgusting wateringplace, he quite won my Mother&#x2019;s heart, so that she invited him and his Sister (whom, <foreign>soit dit on passant</foreign> [let it be said in passing], neither she nor myself had ever set eyes upon) to visit us on our return to Haddington&#x2014; I could have wished my Mother&#x2019;s prudence more or her hospitality less; but when she takes a fit of fondness for any one, it is vain to interfere with her in the indulgence of it, while it lasts&#x2014; Well! on the day appointed my Gentleman arrived, accompanied by a little smiling girl from an English boarding-school, and what I had foreseen and dreaded came to pass: the first time that I was left alone with him, out came a matrimonial proposition in due form. In my life, I never felt such difficulty in giving a refusal&#x2014;not that I had the smallest disposition in the world to consent&#x2014;oh dear no! my new lover has neither the fire of Lord Byron, nor the wit of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Terrot, and in point of elegance he cannot be compared with my steamboat Colonel:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane must be referring to the &#x201C;fascinating Colonel of the Guards&#x201D; who &#x201C;held an umbrella&#x201D; over her &#x201C;for twenty-four hours&#x201D; on her trip from Glasgow to Fort William. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220924-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1822-09-24">24 Sept. 1822</date></ref>, and below, note 4.</note> but then he has fair silky locks, the sweetest eyes in nature, a voice like music, and a heart so warm and true and so wholely, wholely mine! all which had such a softening effect upon me, that I could not bring myself to say I did not love him; I prefer<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed telling a lie of any magnitude to wounding him with such cruel words; besides my Mother had told me that the <hi rend="italic">handsomest way of refusing a man was to say that I was engaged</hi>, so I did not scruple to say so in the present instance. Fortunately the distress which this declaration threw him into, saved me from further questioning; I should have found it rather troublesome at the moment to have furnished my beau ideal with a name. Poor youth he threw himself down on the sopha beside me, and wept and sobbed like a child. I called him &#x2018;dear Dugald,&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dugald Gilchrist.</note> to pacify him, and kissed his forehead at least half a dozen times (was not that good of me?) but he would not be comforted: he lay in bed, and cried all the rest of the day; my Mother sat and cried beside him; and his Sister and I cried in another apartment. About ten o&#x2019;clock at night my Mother prevailed on him to rise and take a walk! she thought the cool air would do the poor Boy good, <pb id="pg-03-130" n="03:130"/>for he had cried himself into a fever. I was sent on with him before, that he might say out what he had to say to me, and be done with it; my Mother &#x26; Catharine followed at a little distance&#x2014;what a dark, silent, sorrowful walk it was! We were on the way back, he had not spoken for several minutes, when all at once he gave a sort of cry, and fell down at my side; I shut my eyes and stood motionless; I could not stir to assist him; I thought he was dead. Fortunately my Mother had more presence of mind; she ran up to us when she saw him fall, and lifted him off his face. God! how he looked! He was as white as ashes and his eyes were wide ope<supplied>[n]</supplied> and fixed. He stirred and spoke at last; but he could not stand without supporting himself on my Mother, and what he said was quite incoherent: however I was thankful. His sister behaved heroically on the occasion: she adores her Brother, yet instead of occupying herself with him, or increasing my agony by any expression of her fears (as it was natural for her to have done) she threw her arms about my neck, and besought me not to distress myself; for that he would get <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;better sense&#x2019;</hi> in time. My Mother half carried him home and, he went to bed delirious, but his fever left him before morning; however no entreaties could prevail on him to rise or take a morsel of food. He lay for three days and nights without sleep and almost without sustenance, tossing on his bed and crying his lovely eyes out: his sister and my Mother began to get dreadfully alarmed, for he positively assured them that he would never rise again, and, if he abstained much longer from eating, it was probable that he never would; for me I had been nearly distracted ever since the night-scene at the water-side. I resolved to try my influence with him, as theirs had been tried to no purpose; it was not a time to be thinking about etiquette, so <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;I girded up my mind,&#x2019;</hi> walked deliberately into his room and sat down by my Mother &#x26; Catharine on the side of his bed. He gave me a great stare; then hid his face in the bedclothes; I asked very gravely what ailed him? He stared again, and answered was I mad? I repeated my question; he laughed; then cried; then scolded me for making him laugh. I asked would he take some tea? he said he would&#x2014; Would he rise and come into the drawingroom? yes, yes, he would do any thing I bid him&#x2014; So he rose and took tea with us&#x2014; In about a week, by skillful treatment we brought him to a more reasonable frame of mind. then came your letter, which made matters worse than ever&#x2014; It seems I turned pale when it was delivered to me (I always do when I get a letter which I have been looking for) and then I blushed (the most natural thing on earth for I noticed Mr Gilchrist <pb id="pg-03-131" n="03:131"/>staring at me) from which aspects he concluded like a sensible young man that this must be a letter from his favoured rival. His agitation became so distressing that I was obliged to leave the room; and I was no sooner gone than he tumbled off his chair. I heard him fall and my Mother throw up the window; I ran back; he was lying on the floor with the same deathlike look which I had seen before. He came to himself in a few minutes, but the fainting fit was followed by spasms which lasted near an hour. and to complete the business as soon as he recovered and my Mother could leave him she came into the room where I was and took hysterics. Imagine if you can my feelings all this while. you will have some idea of them when I tell you, it entered my mind for <hi rend="italic">one instant</hi> to promise that I would be his wife! Well for me that it was only for an instant! This however was the last trial of my fortitude. The poor Boy is not ungenerous&#x2014;he is only weak; he saw the distress which he was occasioning us, and was sorry for it. Since that evening he has struggled manfully with his grief and with such success, that he left us today, almost the same as before this unlucky affair took place&#x2014;only that he looks more thoughtful more manly as if in a few days he had lived years.</p>
<p>He is really a love-able creature this Dugald Gylchrist&#x2014;now that his whim of marrying me is past&#x2014;his affection for me is of no common sort; it is tender, devoted, hopeless: even his nervous sensibility which I would despise in another man, is in him excusable nay almost inter<supplied>[e]</supplied>sting, for it has been occasioned (I am persuaded) by a misfortune which befell him at his outset in life and which gave a shock to his young mind from which it has never yet recovered. I will tell you about it if you care to know some other time<supplied>[;]</supplied> for the present, I suspect you have enough of him&#x2014;</p>
<p>Then have I more than filled my paper with this long history which tho&#x2019; deeply interesting to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, may perhaps be the very reverse to you; and I have still a thousand things to ask and say. I have a story to tell you about the abominable little D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, of his meaness, and &#x2018;hypocrisy that would shame the morals of a crocodile.&#x2019; I have some curious matter too, which concerneth the West<supplied>[s]</supplied>&#x2014; Ony think they wanted to send me as a sort of wife-nursery-maid with their Boy-officer to Malta! I think the people are all gone mad at present&#x2014; Will you write speedily, and tell me about yourself&#x2014; You cannot think how well I liked your last letter&#x2014;it had more the aspect of hope and happiness than any I ever received from you&#x2014; My heart is softened towards that vexatious Orator by what you say of him; I will answer his letter tomorrow so <pb id="pg-03-132" n="03:132"/>please the fates&#x2014; He has got a little son it seems&#x2014;have you heard if it has discovered genius yet?

<p><salute>My Dearest&#x2014;</salute>what in Heaven&#x2019;s name is the matter? Are you sick or in distress? Is that cursed headache tormenting you that you cannot write to me? Or are you angry at me, and determined to avenge yourself by keeping silence and leaving me to the guardian Angels of the Imagination? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tantaene oe animis c&#x9c;lestibus irae?</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Vergil&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, I, 11: &#x201C;Is there such wrath in heavenly minds?&#x201D;</note> Have you the heart willfully to keep me in impatient anxieties for a month, and then begin your letter as you threatened with a &#x201C;Sir&#x201D;? Do not, I intreat you: <pb id="pg-03-133" n="03:133"/>what use is it to vex one another, as if Fate did not vex us both sufficiently. I declare I know not what to make of it: every morning, that old hooknosed man totters up to the post-office; bringing Badams news of vitriol and vermilion and pictures and sweepstakes; bringing me too letters and packets from the north and from the south&#x2014;but from Jane no breath of tidings! What shall I do? If I know you to be well and happy, I could wait for months in patience: as it is, I must wait; but Heaven knows, not in patience. If you do not mean to be very cruel, you will write me&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it were but a line&#x2014;to say that you are in the land of the living, at peace and cheerful and not utterly oblivious of the all-important <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. I pray God that I may hear of your welfare, and that common causes only have prevented you from writing. I mean not to languish in the pastoral style at present: but dear, dear Jane, do write; and there&#x2019;s an end of it!</p>
<p>Perhaps after all, you have but been jaunting up and down the world, and have had no leisure to think or talk, much less to write. Perhaps even you have never got my last scrawl, and know not whither to address a letter. If so, you are still a stranger to the sad news that <hi rend="italic">R&#xfc;bezahl</hi>, your much laboured <hi rend="italic">R&#xfc;bezahl</hi>, has been already printed in English! I have not seen the book; one Crabbe Robinson, an ancient Templar, told me of its existence, and more by token, that they had called the lubber Gnome himself by the name of <hi rend="italic">Number-nip</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">R&#xfc;bezahl</hi> means &#x201C;count-turnip&#x201D; (cf. <hi rend="italic">neep</hi>: &#x201C;turnip&#x201D; in Scots). In German folklore he was a legendary giant who fell in love with and captured a princess who set him to growing turnips for her and then counting them. Because he could never get the number right, she got time to plan her escape, and he thus acquired his name. The tale had been translated in <hi rend="italic">Popular Tales of the Germans</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1791">1791</date>), by William Beckford (<date when="1759">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844">1844</date>). It is the first story in Vol. II: &#x201C;Elfin Freaks; or the Seven Legends of Number-nip.&#x201D;</note> [<hi rend="italic">nip</hi> underscored twice], which Crabbe thought no ordinary stroke of editorial felicity. Finish your tale however, and let us keep it as a memorial of your diligence. The publication is of course now out of the question; but the benefit to you is not lost; and we shall easily devise some other task for you. Nay I have already thought of one; which I want much to hear your vote upon. That interminable <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi>, has at length drop by drop appeared in the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi>&#x2014;all except the last fragment; and after much higgling to and fro, I have nearly agreed to publish it in a separate and much enlarged form with Taylor &#x26; Hessey&#x2014;they, <hi rend="italic">greedy</hi> Knaves, allowing me fifty pounds additional, for the projected improvements, the extent of which <hi rend="italic">need</hi> be only very small but will most probably be considerable<supplied>[.]</supplied> Among these improvements, the most obvious are translations of Schiller&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-03-134" n="03:134"/>best pieces in prose and verse&#x2014;scenes from his plays, poems; and extracts from his historical and philosophical writings. Now is there aught here for my own scholar? What if you should send for <hi rend="italic">Schillers Gedichte</hi> (the two first volumes of his <hi rend="italic">Werke</hi>) and read them over, selecting whatever you liked best, and were most disposed for? &#x201C;O you fool! I cannot, I cannot!&#x201D; O you fool, you can, you can. The Tiger<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Tiger Wull&#x201D; Dunlop.</note> (not of Bengal, but Dundas-street) would get you these books from Gillies; they are to be had for a trifle in the book-shops. Here would be room for your critical sagacity, and for the exercise of your powers of composition. Many of the poems you will not like, or perhaps fully comprehend&#x2014;unless you are wiser than your philosopher: but others of them are delightful; The Germans prate about the <hi rend="italic">Cranes of Ibycus</hi> (which is not bad) and the <hi rend="italic">Ritter Toggenburg</hi> (which is not good) and the <hi rend="italic">Spaziergang</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ideal</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Glocke</hi> and many more; which I relish even less: but among those I have yet read I remember none that pleased me more than <hi rend="italic">Hero and Leander</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Alpenlied</hi> both in the second volume. Try the <hi rend="italic">Alpenlied</hi>: it is short and quite a jewel for beauty. Or will you have scenes of plays&#x2014;translate me the scene between Posa and Philip in <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos</hi>, or any scene in <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi> that you like.

Schiller&#x2019;s essay is a dignified but severe attack on the popular poetry of Gottfried August B&#xfc;rger (<date when="1747">1747</date>&#x2013;<date when="1794">94</date>).</note> (I think in the eighth volume) or any other thing that strikes you.

And think if it will not be pretty to have your little casket locked up and begirt on every side in the masses of my coarse stoneware; shielded from all danger of critical-teeth with J.

Shall your life of noble tho&#x2019; half-blind struggling be utterly lost? <pb id="pg-03-135" n="03:135"/>Where is the laurel wreath I promised you? Be diligent and patient and wise, and it shall yet be yours.&#x2014; Write about these things to me&#x2014;seriously and copiously. What is the use of me, if not to help you forward in the pa<supplied>[th]</supplied> of duty and improvement? There is not another soul alive that wishes w<supplied>[ith]</supplied> such earnestness to see you good and perfect, the lovely and graceful and wise and dignified woman it is in your power to be. Oh that my powers and wishes should be so discrepant! Yet cease not to consult with me, at least; by our united efforts, notwithstanding all our errors, much, much may be accomplished: let us work while it is called to-day; for the night cometh wherein no man can work! I hope from you more than I will trust to words: <hi rend="italic">it depends on both</hi> that the fairest visions be not utterly abolished, and nothing but a waste wreck of dreary ruin left behind!</p>
<p>I have no room to speak about myself. Badams still swears he will <hi rend="italic">bring me into condition</hi>, will restore my health, and set me fairly on my feet unshackled by the infernal miseries that have almost sunk me into utter nothingness. If he keep his word, I laugh at fortune! As yet however it is all, or very nearly all, prospective: I am weak and stupid and depressed as ever; for the man has been experimenting on me, and drugs are an abomination to me in all their shapes. What think you of rising at six o&#x2019;clock, and gallopping two hours upon a fiery hunter before breakfast? I began this morning. Badams is one of the finest fellows I have ever seen: in years scarcely older than myself, he has his destiny as it were subdued and lying at his feet, and all things fit around him, like the wheels in an eight-day clock. I cannot help wondering at the man, and at the relation I am in to him. Six weeks ago I did not know of his existence, and now we are acquaintances of fifty years standing! Badams has a clear head, an ardent simple heart,and no <hi rend="italic">genius</hi>, as you would call it: thus he is quiet and kind and frolicksome and good. I begin to think the world has more worthy persons in it than I counted on. I have also seen learned ladies here!&#x2014; But <foreign><hi rend="italic">satis jam</hi></foreign> [enough]! No word farther till you write me, on far more interesting topics!</p>
<p>And when will that be, <foreign>Liebchen</foreign>? I declare it will be doubly and trebly hard, if you keep me waiting longer. Do not, do not! I long to know your history, your thoughts and purposes and feelings. Tell me every thing, in your dear <hi rend="italic">chatting</hi> style. There is nothing in life like one of your right letters.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I would have answered your letter sooner but for a long series of movements and countermovements I have had to execute. I also wished to <hi rend="italic">read</hi> Goethe&#x2019;s Book,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</hi>, the first (incomplete) edition of which had appeared in <date when="1821">1821</date>.</note> before determining on your proposal with regard to it. This I have at length done: I find it will not answer. The work is incomplete, the first volume only having yet appeared; and it consists of a series of fragments, individually beautiful, but quite disjointed, and in their present state scarcely intelligible. I have my eye upon another book of his; but as yet it is very dubious. For the present I am busy with a <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi>, which is to come out I expect early in winter.</p>
<p>I came to Birmingham in pursuit of health; I have been here some weeks, and design continuing some weeks longer. My address is: Care of John Badams Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, Birmingham. After <date when="1824-09">September</date> it will be: 4 Myddelton Terrace, Pentonville, London&#x2014; Mr Badams, my physician and kind friend, is a person whom you may perhaps know more here after. As a practical chemist I predict that, should life and health be spared him, he will have few rivals in Europe. Among a multitude of other subjects which have occupied him, some of which he is turning to splendid account already, he has for the last few weeks been engaged in investigating the properties and composition of <hi rend="italic">printers&#x2019; <pb id="pg-03-137" n="03:137"/>ink</hi>; in which I understand he has succeeded in effecting considerable savings of expense and other improvements. I have mentioned your house to him, as one well suited to appreciate and profit by his discoveries; and it is not impossible that by and by I may use the freedom to introduce to you a specimen of his ware, that you may try and judge.</p>
<p>I am anxious to hear of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>. From your account combined with the sale of the work in London, I should suppose the first edition must be nearly done; and by way of making good the ground we have gained, I think a second ought to be made to follow without delay. The Book has been sufficiently puffed and censured to awaken the public curiosity respecting it; and the more it is known, the more I am confident will it be relished. But the iron should be kept hot. Will you be so good as to let me hear your views on this subject, when you conveniently can? I have several alterations to make, and should like to have time before me. If you feel indisposed to take another edition, the first having sated you,&#x2014;of course you are free.&#x2014; I took a copy from Whittaker, using the freedom to reckon it as another <hi rend="italic">Author&#x2019;s copy</hi>, and to say that I would settle with <hi rend="italic">you</hi> about it. Goethe&#x2019;s copy I found means of sending to him; but as yet no answer has arrived.</p>

<salute>My dear Murray,</salute>
<p>Were I not aware, by repeated trials, of the natural tolerance of your disposition, I should feel in pain about the reception which my present sheet might meet with. As it is, however, I know you will forgive me; I know there will be joy in your spirit over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons. The truth is I am guilty of flagrant negligence, yet not so guilty as I seem. I almost despair of making you believe that I wrote you a letter some weeks ago [remainder of first page missing]. &#x2026; <supplied>[I]</supplied> honestly assure you I needed not the explanations it contained to feel perfectly at ease about your conduct on the day of my departure.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1824-06-11">11 June</date>, written from Edinburgh, Murray apologized for failing to see Carlyle off on his trip to London and explained that a group of relatives from Galloway had come in on him just as he was leaving for Carlyle&#x2019;s lodgings. He added: &#x201C;It would have given me the greatest satisfaction to have been the last in your native land to bid you <foreign>adieu</foreign> and to wish you that happiness &#x26; success to which you are <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi> &#x26; powerfully entitled. Indeed I have no doubt of your great success, if providence bless you with any thing like an average portion of health, and continue to you the use of those rich endowments and cherish in you that noble spirit of doing something to perpetuate your name,&#x2014;by which you have hitherto been characterized.&#x201D;</note> Missing you on the shore, <pb id="pg-03-138" n="03:138"/>I merely thought some pressing business had detained you; and I quitted the muddy beach of my native Scotland &#x201C;stern nurse for a <hi rend="italic">dyspeptic</hi> child,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adapted from <hi rend="italic">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</hi>, Canto VI, ll. 17&#x2013;18: &#x201C;O Caledonia! stern and wild, / Meet nurse for a poetic child!&#x201D;</note> with no other feelings towards it than I had long entertained. Hard, rugged land! I often think of its earnest features, amid the rich scenes of the South: distance is producing something of its usual effect; much that was unpleasant or repulsive is forgotten or softened down, and I think of the grim landscape of Perthshire or the bleak simplicity of Annandale with a pleasure which the sight of them was often far from giving. Unless you interpret it to be the spirit of contradiction, you will be surprised to learn that I am fast becoming a <hi rend="italic">patriot</hi> of the most decided stamp. Scornfully as I used to speak and think of Scotland in my hours of bitterness and irritation, I never fail to stand up manfully in defence of it thro&#x2019; thick and thin, whenever a renegade Scot takes upon him to abuse it (the English are too well&#x2014;[remainder of page missing] . &#x2026; weeks they <hi rend="italic">kept</hi> changing at the rate of about a plan per day. At length I flatly declined changing any farther, signified that I would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> accompany them to France; and by way of finale earnestly advised them to send their boy to Cambridge, or anywhither so he might but be withdrawn from fashionable fluctuation and frivolities. They complied with my advice, and parted with me in the spirit I desired. Thus left at freedom in the great city, I determined in preference to all other things to take some serious measures for my health, the state of which had lately been growing more vexatious than ever. A gentleman of this place, a Mr Badams, with whom I had scraped acquaintance and been mightily pleased, invited me to accompany him hither for a month or two, to put myself under his management, which has already been successful in curing several most obstinate cases of dyspepsia&#x2014;his own among the number. Badams does not practice physic, tho he knows it thoroughly: he is a chemist by occupation; one of the most gifted as well as frank and friendly men I have ever met with. In consequence of his invitation I came to Birmingham five weeks ago, and have been living here [remainder of page missing] . &#x2026; Hardship, I suspect, has withered out the sensibilities of his nature, and turned him finally into a sort of <pb id="pg-03-139" n="03:139"/>whisking antithetical little Editor.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Campbell, who edited the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi> from <date when="1820">1820</date> to <date when="1830">1830</date>.</note> There is no significance in his aspect: his blue frock and switch and fashionable wig, and clear cold eyes and clipt accents and slender <hi rend="italic">persifflage</hi>, might befit a dandy better than a poet. Allan Cunningham I love; he retains the honest tones of his native Nithsdale true as ever: he has a heart and a mind simple as a child&#x2019;s, but with touches of a genius singularly wild and original. Barry Cornwall is a kind little fellow; sings Italian airs, keeps daggers and other play gear lying on his dressing table, deals in prints and pictures; is of &#x201C;the mob of gentlemen that write with ease.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Pope, <hi rend="italic">Imitations of Horace</hi>, Book II, Epistle I, l. 108.</note> Charles Lamb is a ricketty creature in body and mind, sprawls about and walks as if his body consisted of four ill-conditioned flails, and talks as if he were quarter drunk with ale and half with laudanum. Coleridge is a steam-engine of a hundred horses power&#x2014;with the boiler burst. His talk is resplendent with imagery and the shows of thought; you listen as to an oracle, and find yourself no jot the wiser. He is without beginning or middle or end. A round fat oily yet impatient little man, his mind seems totally beyond his own controul; he speaks incessantly, not thinking or imagining or remembering, but combining all these processes into one; as a rich and lazy housewife might mingle her soup and fish and beef and custard into one unspeakable mass and present it trueheartedly to her astonished guests. William Hazzlitt takes his punch and oysters and rackets and whore at regular intervals; escaping from bailiffs as he best can, and writing when they grow <foreign>unguidable</foreign><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scots: unmanageable.</note> by any other means.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I received the letter of my trusty and affectionate correspondents Alick and Jack<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1824-08-22">22 Aug.</date> Alick declared that his father was delighted with Carlyle&#x2019;s description of Birmingham and that he &#x201C;could not forbear exclaiming even while we were reading in his own emphatic way&#x2014;&#x2018;he is a terrible fallow that too.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> three days ago; and at your request I make no delay, you see, in answering it. I felt a good deal of alarm at the first glance on noticing that you had been a little below your usual state of health for some days; but on looking at the statement a second time, and recollecting our mutual promise to be <hi rend="italic">quite candid</hi> in our accounts to one another, I have persuaded myself that it is nothing serious, and that a little while will set you where you were. Nevertheless I shall expect farther news with no ordinary impatience; you must write yourself, or employ some other to write whenever you return from bathing. O my dear Mother, what thankless thoughtless creatures we must be! God has spared us all for many years in unity and affection for one another; while others that deserved it equally have been parted by the inexorable hand of Death; and yet, as you have often said, how seldom do we even recollect the blessing as we ought! But for you I should have felt myself utterly alone in this toilsome world; the idea of separation at this moment drives me to the borders of despair. But why should I dwell on this melancholy view of things? We are in the hands of the Good Being who called us into existence: let us humbly trust that He will not afflict us beyond what we are able to bear; that we may yet be spared long long in the land of the living, and that we may meet beyond the shore of Time, never to part any more!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-141" n="03:141"/>You wish for nothing, you say, but to hear of my welfare. I know how much pleasure I shall give you when I shall be able to declare myself completely free of bodily ill health; a prediction I have often made, and as yet alas! in vain. Meanwhile I think I can assure you that I am <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> in the way of recovery; at least I am certainly no worse than when you saw me. Badams sends me out to ride in the morning and at night; he feeds me on diluents (ask Jack) and spare diet, and gives me physic every alternate day; by which means tho&#x2019; my strength has not been increased, I feel a great diminution in the irritability and pain and confusion of head I used to suffer; which things I incline to look upon as favourable symptoms of a partial, or perhaps finally of a total cure. For the last few days I have been thrown backwards a little; but that is but purchasing experience at the common price. Badams had gone to London, Martin the worthy minister of Kirkcaldy came hither in his way to see his son-in-law,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving.</note> and I, overpersuaded by my liking of the man, agreed to dine with him at the house of one M&#x2019;Turk, a Galloway merchant of this place. I am now got nearly quite round to my former point; but I <hi rend="italic">will not dine out again</hi>. Badams returned on thursday, and is getting me by degrees brought into a regular system. In the article of sleep, I am greatly better than I once was: I now enjoy my regular hours of rest almost like another man. On the whole I still hope confidently that I shall improve. In Badams&#x2019; house I am completely comfortable: we go on liking one another better and better; he infuses trust into me by his own heartiness in the cause of my training; and his housekeeper, a sedate much-suffering quiet religious mother of a family such as there are very few, takes all the pains in the world to keep every thing in the most pleasant order. I ride, as I have said, about an hour before breakfast, on one of our doctor&#x2019;s stately hunters; then he gives me two soft eggs, with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> thin, thin slice of bread, and (if I like) <hi rend="italic">five</hi> cups of excellent tho&#x2019; not strong tea; after which I read or saunter about or rest myself till half past two; then Mrs Barnet comes rapping at my door with two glasses of wine in a tumbler, which I keep sipping for half an hour till I am summoned down to a little bowl of soup and a little piece of meat with four potatoes, which constitutes my dinner: I have as much tea at six as I like to drink with <hi rend="italic">no</hi> bread to it; then at half past eight, a soft egg with a bit of bread and another glass of wine constitutes my supper (when I come in from walking or riding); after which I sit and talk or read again till ten, and then betake me to <pb id="pg-03-142" n="03:142"/>repose. Such is my general mode of life. I cannot help wondering at the pains the people take with me. Indeed I have reason to wonder at the friendship I have met with since I left you from many quarters. It was but yesterday that Mrs Strachey sent me a very kind epistle, with the present of a book (Chalmers&#x2019; Sermons), and a hint of some proposal to go down with her and Irving to spend some weeks at seabathing. Irving is to be here, perhaps to-morrow at any rate next week, when I shall hear more of this. Mrs Strachey is Mrs Buller&#x2019;s sister; but as unlike her as pure gold is to gilt copper: she is an earnest, determined, warm-hearted, religious matron, while the other is but a fluttering patroness of routs and operas, a vulgar fine lady. I shall very likely go with Mrs S; and if so I doubt not I shall be very happy. Next time you shall hear more of this. For my future destination in the world, I am grown vastly more composed on that subject than I was. I feel confident enough that I can fight my way among others, either in England or at home: if my health be restored to me, I even hope to do some service in my day and generation; if not I shall ever struggle on as I have hitherto done, and try to possess my soul in patience for the appointed time of my stewardship, and to give in the best account of it that my hampered and sorely obstructed circumstances will admit. Let me beg of you therefore, my dear Mother, to be in no distress on my account: I still feel assured that every thing will be for the best.</p>
<p>And now having listened to me thus far on the subject of myself allow me, my good Mother, to address you on one which I have more call to speak of. I think if I were beside you, I could now suggest some improvements in your diet and mode of life, which might be of service to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, who I know too well have much to suffer on your own part, tho&#x2019; your affection renders you so exclusively anxious about me. I am convinced you should daily make some such breakfast as I do: I have felt nothing do me so much good that I have ever tried. Porridge Badams condemns, except for stomachs of considerable strength; food nourishing and small in bulk, with warm liquids, are infinitely better. You will say, you cannot be <foreign><hi rend="italic">fashed</hi></foreign> [troubled]. O my dear Mother, if you did but think of what value your health and comfort are to us all, you would never talk so. Are we not all bound to you by sacred and indissoluble ties? Am not I so bound more than any other? Who was it that watched me and nursed me in frowardness and sickness from the earliest dawn of my existence to this hour? My Mother. Who is it that has struggled for me in pain and sorrow with undespairing diligence, <pb id="pg-03-143" n="03:143"/>that has for me been up early and down late, caring <supplied>[for]</supplied> me, labouring for me, unweariedly assisting me? My Mother. Who is the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> that <hi rend="italic">never</hi> shrunk fr<supplied>[om me]</supplied> in my desolation, that <hi rend="italic">never</hi> tired of my despondencies or shut up by <supplied>[a]</supplied> look or a tone <supplied>[of imp]</supplied>atience the expression of my real or imaginary griefs? Who is it that <supplied>[loves]</supplied> me, and will love me forever, with an affection which no chance no misery no crime of mine ca<supplied>[n do]</supplied> away? It is you, my Mother! As the greatest favour I can beg of you, let me <supplied>[k]</supplied>now that I have in some degree the power be of some assistance in promoting your comfort. It were one of the achievements which I could look back upon with most satisfaction from all the stages of my earthly pilgrimage, if I could make you happier. Are not all of us animated by a similar love to you? Why then will you spare any trouble any cost in what is valuable beyond aught earthly to every one of us? If the sea bathing benefit you, stay at it, whatever be the consequence: if there is any thing (there must be many things) you can think of that would do you good, do mention it. I was going to write you many things about diet; but I fear you will pay too little heed to them. There is one sort of meal which I will mention, and which either by way of breakfast or dinner I am convinced you would find to be a marked improvement. It is a mixture of egg and milk, with or without a slice of toast and butter. Take the yolk of an egg (excluding the white) and break it among a few spoonfuls of cold sweet milk; have another stock of sweet milk (say a <foreign>mutchkin</foreign> [pint]) heated to boiling, which add gradually to the mixture, stirring well; then put in a little sugar; and you have a fine yellowish fluid, palateable, nutritive and digestible. You may take two eggs if for a dinner. Try this half a dozen times, and tell me how it suits: Badams says that for a weak stomach he knows nothing so good. When you need physic take a <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> dose of Castor oil, three hours before breakfast, and drink plenty of tea. A strong dose is best, for you get rid of it at once. I would also have you get two bottles of wine to take a little of it before dinner, but I fear you will not, and I must write to Jack on the subject. One thing I believe, you should have <hi rend="italic">animal food</hi>, and soft eggs are far better than flesh. Two eggs, two little slices of bread, with an egg-and-milk make a light and strong dinner, which I wish much you would try. Cut your bread into little stripes like threads, and chew them till they are ground completely; drinking largely of your warm fluid all the while<supplied>[.]</supplied> Excuse these directions, dear Mother; I am convinced they will benefit you. Try them, try them, and let me know how the prescriptions suit you. I advise you to <pb id="pg-03-144" n="03:144"/>take eggs often: they are nourishing and ready<supplied>[.]</supplied> But I must conclude my lecture, for obvious reasons. O that I had an acre of paper, or a week of speech with you! Thank Alick and Jack for their kind and interesting letter: tell Jack that he is to write the day he receives this, or the very next moment he can get; for I am not without anxieties to know how <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are, and never without a keen desire for tidings about all connected with Mainhill. Is my Father well? I consider myself as owing him a letter, which I mean not to owe him long. Alick must keep an eye on farms: I long to hear more of him; I will write whenever they give me a chance. Jack must tell me of his studies and consult me, and <hi rend="italic">describe you</hi>. What is Mag doing, and my little sharp-tempered, warm-hearted nurse?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently his sister Mary.</note> Say that I love them, and wish them to remember me. My love to Jane and Jenny (are they still at school?)and also to <hi rend="italic">Mister Carlill</hi>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle, Jr.</note> <closer><salute>Good night, my dear Mother! I am ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>[In margins:] I have written this mostly between dinner and tea; so that I doubt it is rather dull; but I would not keep you longer waiting. The newspaper came to-day (Saturday) with its <foreign><hi rend="italic">ganz wohl</hi></foreign> [all&#x2019;s well] from Alick, whence I infer you are at bathing. To-morrow as I said I look for Irving, tho&#x2019; not very confidently. He is to ordain Crosbie.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Crosbie.

What is become of Lawson and the meeting-house? Remember me to Mrs Irving of Bogside<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>The harvest is half way done here: they are leading home their stuff in wains drawn by four horses; the wains are like coal-sloops for size, and fill up the lane so that you can hardly pass. The <hi rend="italic">stooks</hi> have only <hi rend="italic">six</hi> sheaves. How are the crops at Mainhill? and when do you begin cutting?

<p><salute><hi rend="italic">Meine Liebe&#x2014;</hi></salute> Your letter, you will easily believe, delivered me from a thousand perplexities. I could have sworn, when old Barnet <pb id="pg-03-145" n="03:145"/>came tottering in with it, that some dreadful calamity was to be revealed; that you were sick or unhappy, or what was little better for the time, that you were out of humour with me, and about to give me my discharge. No one of these fine things was true! You are still good, still kind, still sending me assurances that you are good and kind. Blessed be Cadmus King of Thebes that first imported letters into Europe; blessed be my true hearted Jane that makes such noble use of that invention! tho&#x2019; parted, we are still together; you transport me from the smoky furnaces of Birmingham, home to clear skies and souls that love me; I live with you for a season in scenes we have both lived in, and bright recollections give birth to brighter hopes. Blessings on your head my <foreign>bonny bairn</foreign>! You have long been good to me: I pray more and more earnestly that you may always be so.</p>
<p>What a strange tragicomedy is that of Dugald Gilchrist, which you describe so neatly and with such graphic touches! Poor soul! one knows not whether to laugh at him or weep for him; his heart seems so affectionate and innocent, and at the same time so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> weak. I trust, for his own sake, he will trouble you no more: it is painful to be the cause of pain; but with you there is no remedy. &#x201C;Therein the patient must minister unto himself.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230120-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-01-20">20 Jan. 1823</date></ref>.</note> Another year or two will shew your unhappy friend that the Earth is not entirely a bower of roses and myrtles; and that men have many thousand things to do and to endure which love has no concern with. I feel for the poor youth; his lesson will be hard but not uninstructive or useless. The visions of eighteen are beautiful as the path of Aurora; but transient and baseless as they are beautiful. A little while and the glories of the East<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An interesting anticipation of the symbolism in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> which has to do with Aurora, the East, the Orient.</note> are clean gone; and after all, what matters it so much whether one fell gust of tempest or the silent march of the Hours have chaced them away? Yet tell me if you hear again of Dugald: I love a kind nature, and feel for its sorrows not less because I know that universal Destiny not single accidents are to be blamed for them. For <hi rend="italic">your</hi> conduct in the matter, I should admire it, tho&#x2019; I had no farther interest in it. What a pretty mixture of mercy and gracefulness and female cunning! So, you are <hi rend="italic">engaged</hi>, are you? Would that I had a cast of the Sybilline Books, or the Linen Books, or the future session Books, or any book that would tell me to whom! Is he a genius and &#x201C;elegant&#x201D;? Is he a poet or a philosopher or both in one? Let him look to it that he be a worthy man, and love you with a faithful heart! If he do not, I myself will <pb id="pg-03-146" n="03:146"/>pull the varlet&#x2019;s nose, and tell him that he merits not to dwell upon our planet! Well! ere long, old Time will try: how many things will he try!</p>
<p>But I must leave my speculation, and take to practice. What are you about in Nithsdale; what are you employed in or amused with? Have you taken into serious deliberation the task I assigned you? I am still as bold on it as ever; I can yet admit of no denial. Tell me soon and punctually what I am to look for. Fear not to speak to me of indolence and tardiness: ever since I came to Warwickshire, I have been the idlest man myself in the united kingdoms. <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> is still, except some vague ideas and a few faint and altogether bootless attempts at translation, exactly where he was. My learned Bibliopolists<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The letter from Hessey, dated <date when="1824-08-31">31 Aug.</date>, agrees to the terms of Carlyle&#x2019;s second letter of <date when="1824-08-06">6 Aug.</date> in every detail. Hessey writes: &#x201C;I have made on the annexed leaf a Copy of your Letter respecting Schiller and have written at the foot of it a memorandum stating our Concurrence in all the stipulations which are proposed by you.&#x201D; On the outside of Hessey&#x2019;s letter Carlyle has written: &#x201C;Taylor &#x26; Hessey&#x2019;s Barg<hi rend="italic">n</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi>: n.b. in direct <hi rend="italic">despite</hi> of &#x26; 5&#xB0;, I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to pay old Taylor some &#xa3;20 (?) for the new Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, <date when="1845">1845</date> (?)!&#x2014; C<hi rend="italic">dn&#x2019;t</hi> find this anywhere [<hi rend="italic">found</hi>, <date when="1869-03">March 1869!</date>].&#x201D; The edition of <date when="1845">1845</date> was published by Chapman &#x26; Hall, and Carlyle paid the &#xa3; 20 in order to be released from Taylor and Hessey.</note> are on their side not a whit more active: it was but this very morning that I received their final ratification of our bargain; their books, from Bohte<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240806-TC-JHE-01">TC to <sic>JH</sic><corr>JHE</corr>, <date when="1824-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref></note> and other Germans, are still to come &#x201C;in a day or two.&#x201D; Blame me not, dearest Jane! I feel deeply enough that life is short and art long;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hippocrates, <hi rend="italic">Aphorisms</hi>, I, 1; cf. Goethe, <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, I, 1. <date when="1788">1788</date>; and <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi> in Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 75.</note> and oh how small, very small a way have I yet advanced in this same art! Nevertheless, Badams and physical prescriptions and the Devil and my own foolish heart keep me as it were enchanted to the spot. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nondum</hi></foreign> [not yet], should be my motto, with poppies argent and three sloths dormant on a tree disleaved! I do little but ride and sleep and read the most unutterable trash of novels, cursing as I read. Badams says I am recovering: the perpetual gnawing of pain with its confused irritation and obscuration of the soul have in truth I think somewhat left me; but weariness and weakness and a passion for repose have succeeded. I am growing quite an Asiatic. I seem as if I could dream away my life amid citron groves and the perfumes and spice-trees of the East; with visions in my silly head, such as all poetry and all painting and all harmony were but feeble to express. And alas! this is not Araby the blest, but brickbuilt sooty <foreign><hi rend="italic">Brumachem</hi></foreign>; nor am I a genie of the King of Soloman, but a hapless dyspeptical philosopher <pb id="pg-03-147" n="03:147"/>from the moors of Annandale! After all it were better for me to be quiet: there is a progress in all things; and if I reach but the fiftieth part of what I sometimes meditate, I shall be a happy man. This pitiful book must be printed in November; then: &#x201C;To-morrow to fresh fields and pastures new!&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Milton, &#x201C;Lycidas,&#x201D; last line.</note> I tell thee, our culture is but as it were beginning; there are regions of thought and feeling which have scarcely as yet loomed on the edge of our horizon; thither let us tend unweariedly, never never parting by the way! What may we not accomplish! In hours of happy musing, I figure myself as the interpreter of truth and manly integrity and imaginative beauty to thousands of my fellow men; and Jane, my fair and pure Egeria, my inspiring Goddess of the Fountain, to originate, to perfect, adorn and recompense my labours! Call this gasconading and vain dreaming: I know it is, my dearest; yet something of it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be realized; and if we both live, <hi rend="italic">shall</hi>.</p>
<p>I heard of you since you wrote to me: the Orator was here two days ago, and said he had been corresponding with you. He did not seem to feel particularly gratified by the ditty you had sung to him: he said &#x201C;he once thought you had no other view but to laugh at him.&#x201D; By degrees, however, it appeared, he had taken up a more rational interpretation of the matter, and written to you, assuring you that you were wrong, and he not less your friend than ever. It must be owned the man is nearly mad on some points, especially on that of writing letters. He said he was ever ready at a moment&#x2019;s warning to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> every thing in his power for his friends; but that he really had not time or topics to <hi rend="italic">write</hi>. I scouted the idea of <hi rend="italic">time</hi>; and told him that as to <hi rend="italic">doing</hi>, none but prime ministers and Asiatic Monarchs could pretend to make or keep friends by that expensive method. I teased him and posed him, as we rode along together to the Leasowes, till he drew down the corners of his mouth, and growled in a style too ominous for my proceeding farther. I do not know that he will yet reform; nor is it of essential moment. Of his friendship for you and me I no more doubt than I do of our own; it should be our part to pardon him a multitude of faults and affectations, as we ourselves may have a multitude to be pardoned. Tell me how you feel towards him, and that you have forgiven him. Of late he has occupied too many paragraphs of my letters: but I hold any semblance of a friend, however distant it may be, too precious to be parted with for any price; and I cannot rest till I have made the offender&#x2019;s peace with you. Do, let us <hi rend="italic">all</hi> love one another! The world is but a peopled solitude, without kind affections; and of these how few hearts in it are even partially susceptible! This Orator <pb id="pg-03-148" n="03:148"/>will mend, must mend in time, as the carriages and coronets forsake him; he is already half recovered since I saw him in the north.</p>
<p>Doubtless, my dearest, you will come to London; and I of course will fly f<supplied>[rom your]</supplied> approach as from the pestilence! In London you will find a thousand things to dra<supplied>[w]</supplied> improvement from; characters to study and emulate, modes of life to investigate, knowledge of all sorts to make your own. Many times I wished and prayed you had been there, tho&#x2019; it had been only for a little space; I am still bent on being your Cicerone, still confident in your employing me. This matter must be studied farther: we will have it all arranged in time. Of my own stay in London, or proceedings there, I can yet say little definite. My first movement must be farther to the south. Mrs Strachey and the Orator have been combining a watering party to go down to Kent for five or six weeks, and I have almost consented to be one of them. I expect we shall be happy in some degree, tho&#x2019; excepting these two leaders of the expedition, there is no other whom I value very highly. Mrs Strachey must know <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in due time, and love you when she knows you. She is a woman of no ordinary faculties; earnest, warm-hearted, decisive, contemptuous of all that is insignificant and mean, reverential of all that is great and noble. She is Mrs Buller&#x2019;s sister; but no more like her than the diamond of Golconda is to that of Bristol.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18231216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1823-12-16">16 Dec. 1823</date></ref>. A Bristol diamond is a kind of transparent rock crystal, resembling a diamond, found in the Clifton limestone near Bristol.</note> She and I almost <hi rend="italic">swore a friendship</hi> for one another at our second interview! This from a religious lady, with a revenue of five thousand pounds per annum! In time, I fear she will become a sceptic; she likes Irving, but sees and laughs at all his vagaries. In three weeks I will tell you more.</p>
<p>For the present, however, I must be done. tho&#x2019; I write in a type almost invisibly small, my paper is on the point of ending. These are but points and heads of intelligence; I have not head enough to put them into better order. Pardon them for their confusion and inanity: what skills it how <hi rend="italic">we</hi> write to one another, so we write enough, and with sufficient want of care! You will send me tidings instantly? Consider, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Liebchen</hi></foreign>, by all laws human and divine, you are a letter in my debt: a fortnight also used to be <hi rend="italic">the time</hi>; why should it be lengthened? But is it not already three weeks since you wrote? Take your pen the first moment you can spare: about the twentieth of this month, I shall be leaving Birmingham. Tell me all that you are doing or concerned with. What is this of the Doctor body?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Fyffe.</note> I fear I shall begin to <pb id="pg-03-149" n="03:149"/>hate the Doctor, if he carry not his little spiritie in a more honest fashion. What has the thing been doing? Tell me fully when you write. Perhaps I overrate the matter, for his deeds <hi rend="italic">can</hi> scarcely be of any moment: nevertheless tell me. Has the unhappy mortal been telling lies of you, or what? For <hi rend="italic">me</hi> within very large limits, he is altogether welcome; but for you it is different.&#x2014; What wise people are the Wests with their baby officer! Did not your heart leap for joy at such a brilliant destiny? Seriously, these things are more than jokes. Tell me punctually about that Schiller and his poems. Do not hesitate; for you <hi rend="italic">must</hi>. Fix upon something, or if you cannot, explain yourself fully and I will help you. It must be done, love; the book comes out in winter; and my little &#x201C;J. W.&#x201D; comes in the middle of it.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He wishes to put some of her translation from Schiller in the middle of the book.</note> So take your measures, madam; and see you get out of this entanglement as best you may. Set to work and write your verses; and mine will encircle them, and protect them, and &#x201C;<foreign>deave</foreign> the flattery [be deafened by the applause?].&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>How is your Mother, and how do you relish Nithsdale? I expect your news impatiently. Will you keep me anxious? No, you will not; seeing you are the best young woman now alive, and <closer><salute>I am&#x2014; Yours forever &#x26; ever,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>My kindest regards to your Mother: she is happy with her friends; let me hope you too find something to delight you. Did you bring books with you? Think of Schiller, and yourself, and me, and be good and happy. God bless you, Dearest!</p></ps>

<salute>Dearest Friend</salute>
<p>I began a letter to you last post day; but it pleased the Devil I should write only a dozen lines of it&#x2014; Some she-people came to call, and the mail passed by before I could get away from them. As now it is likely you will be gone from Birmingham before my letter reaches it: <foreign>n&#x2019;importe</foreign>, your D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> will know where you are to be found.</p>
<p>I have a great many things to tell you, and little time to tell them in&#x2014; In the first place, I have got a new Brother! so unlike me! and yet <pb id="pg-03-150" n="03:150"/>we love each other dearly. His name is Baillie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Capt. James Baillie.</note> and he is my Mother&#x2019;s cousin-german. I mentioned him (I think) when I wrote last; but I had then seen him only for a day; and at the outset of our acquaintance I hardly liked him. I could not but admire his figure, so gracefully noble, his handsome countenance&#x2014;the handsomest I ever saw or fancied&#x2014;his brilliancy, native elegance and courtly polish; but I was magnanimously resolved not to suffer myself to be caught by a dazzling exterior; and his internal qualities I estimated at a very low rate: I mistook his fashionable breeding for his real character, and as he did not wear his heart upon his sleeve, I concluded without the smallest ceremony that he was heartless&#x2014; Besides I had heard that Lady Jane Paget, and Miss Wickham<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Jane Paget (<date when="1798">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876">1876</date>), the daughter of Henry William, first Marquess of Anglesey, married Francis Nathaniel, second Marquess Conyngham (<date when="1797">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876">1876</date>), on <date when="1824-04-23">23 April 1824</date>. Miss Wickham is unidentified.</note> who was asked in marriage by a Prince of the blood would have given their little fingers to get this &#x201C;elegant M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baillie&#x201D; for a husband; and I thought it would be highly creditable for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to be more difficult to please than the highest born Lady and richest Heiress in the Land&#x2014; Now, dont you think I deserved to fall seriously in love with him, as a punishment for my sauciness? I believe nothing but his want of genius could have saved me&#x2014;for in the month we have lived together I have found him more and more amiable every day. He is as generous and affectionate in his nature as the Orator, and more delicate and tender. He has a quick intellect, a most refined taste, and wit more graceful and goodhumoured than M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Terrot&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Hughes Terrot (<date when="1790">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872">1872</date>), bishop of Edinburgh.</note> and quite as brilliant&#x2014;in short he is my beauideal in every respect except that he has no genius! he does not even reverence that quality in others&#x2014; What a pity! or rather what a mercy! for he is to be married in a month or two to one of the loveliest and most accomplished women in England: and I have no passion for hanging myself in my garters&#x2014;like my namesake the &#x201C;unfortunate Miss Baillie<supplied>[.]</supplied>&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An allusion to the old ballad, &#x201C;The Unfortunate Miss Bailey,&#x201D; current in the early years of the last century.

God grant it may not share the fate of the last! The Orator says, in his pathetical epistle to me, that, as soon as his house is ready for the accommodation of a <hi rend="italic">Lady</hi>, I shall hear from him, or if I have forgotten to believe him from one whose constancy of promise and affection I as well as he had reason to <hi rend="italic">admire</hi>! Well! in case of his inviting me <hi rend="italic">very</hi> kindly; I was planning to stay a few weeks with him on my way to Brighton&#x2014;but my Cousin says I shall do no such thing&#x2014;that after having lived with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving I will be blue and evangelical past redemption, and that he does not want me to be instituting family worship in his house and reforming his whole menage&#x2014; I do not know how it will be arranged or if it will be arranged at all&#x2014; I wish most devoutly it may&#x2014;for I am quite tired out with my present manner of life&#x2014; I think, for the last six weeks my Mother has not once been in the same humour for two hours at a time&#x2014;and then her jealousy of me is so intolerable that I am actually frightened when any one shows me kindness&#x2014;<foreign>ne puis</foreign> [can&#x2019;t help it]!

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Being all but entirely idle at present, I feel it a privilege rather than a duty to sit down and scribble to you; knowing as I do that while enjoying the enviable pleasure of talking about subjects most interesting to myself, I shall have the farther advantage of willing and sympathizing hearers. Your letter reached me by the double agency of his Majesty&#x2019;s post, and old hook-nosed Barnet (who travels daily to the office, with an immense long-backed collar-less coat of the last age floating out behind him and flapping over his spindle legs, as if he were the fragment of a Jew&#x2019;s clothes-horse); and happy was I to gain by it a confirmation of the good tidings which the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> had more briefly conveyed on the previous sabbath. I cannot but think how great a mercy it is to me in particular that all my friends are spared around me in the moderate enjoyment of this world&#x2019;s blessings, when any evil, and especially the greatest of all evils that could befal me, the loss of those dearest to me, would be so doubly overwhelming. We <hi rend="italic">are</hi> not sufficiently sensible of the kindness that is mingled in the <pb id="pg-03-153" n="03:153"/>cup of our afflictions. It is not every one that has his parents to care for him, his brothers and sisters to love him: I might have been sicker than I am, and utterly forsaken of friends; alone in a scene of noise and heartless bustle, which even in the fullest health and vigour were a dreary wilderness without affection. Let us be thankful, and love one another, and live in hope!</p>
<p>I trust our Mother is persevering in her ordinary state. You as family physician ought to take some farther charge of regulating her proceedings: I feel convinced that with a little care in the article of diet, she might be put into a better state than she has been in for years. The secret of health with her consists, I am persuaded, in eating little food and that little of the most nutritious quality. You should make her stick to eggs (boiled a minute and a half) with warm diluents, among which good tea of moderate strength with plenty of milk seems to be particularly wholesome and pleasant. I rejoice also to hear that you have procured some wine; a glass of it <hi rend="italic">before</hi> dinner is a special thing: a little brandy with about twice its bulk of water is equally effective; and perhaps can oftener be got in a state of purity. Do you attend to all this, Jack; not for our Mother&#x2019;s sake alone, but for our own also, if you needed any farther motive. A man that does not love and reverence his mother must be worse than a wild beast of the forests; and few have such a mother as we to love. Charge her <hi rend="italic">in my name</hi> to take every precaution, and to stint herself in no convenience; money will not fail us, and what is it but dross and clay except it serve to benefit those dear to us.</p>
<p>I need not tell you with how much proud approval I hear of your unwearied industry in study. Fear not, you will conquer the golden fleece in due season; honest intellectual labour will meet its reward in all cases, and when coupled with gifts like Tongleg&#x2019;s that reward cannot fail to be splendid. Guard only, for heaven&#x2019;s sake guard against the rock on which I have all but made shipwreck: cast not away your health, desert not the common ways of men. Barring these accidents, which I maintain from stern experience no human energy is able to withstand, I have little apprehension for your destiny. The paths of duplicity, and dissipation, and every shape of vice I know you abhor and will continue to avoid: let your stay be true unassuming charity of spirit with manly worth, and solid fundamental knowledge both general and professional; these as two strong cables stretching fore and aft will keep you riding safely in the rudest gale of life. People at your age have many fears, and you are not without your <pb id="pg-03-154" n="03:154"/>share of them: but this is as certain as the Gospel that genuine accomplishment and honesty are prized and <hi rend="italic">loudly demanded</hi> in all departments of society. When I see the paltry persons that live and reap the honours of the chief posts in the world, I should scorn the thought of flinching from a conflict with them. Medicine especially seems to me as rich and as unoccupied a scene as any, perhaps more so than any. O the inept, inane palabra that I hear and see among even the better sort of Doctors! &#x201C;Quack, quack, quack!&#x201D; is but the literal English of nine tenths of what they say. A man like Sydenham, or Mead or Gregory<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Sydenham (<date when="1624">1624</date>&#x2013;<date when="1689">89</date>); Richard Mead (<date when="1673">1673</date>&#x2013;<date when="1754">1754</date>); James Gregory (<date when="1753">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821">1821</date>).</note> would drive ten thousand of them from before him, like chaff, with the breath of his nostrils. Up, Jack! up and be doing what thou canst! In our day I expect to see some marked improvement in this most important of all sciences; especially in the <hi rend="italic">diffusion</hi> of it, in the application of it to the common concerns of life, and those dire affections of the mind which have their source in its domain: I expect this confidently from a multitude of indications; and I hope to see a certain <hi rend="italic">small-featured gentleman</hi> among the foremost in the race. Arise, daring Tongleg; gird up thy loins, and hasten forward like a strong man with never-wearying speed!</p>
<p>I have asked Badams for your list of books; but tho&#x2019; he promises every hour, he has not yet contrived to find the necessary leisure. The truth is, I suspect his own reading is not so extensive as he would have it thought: shrewd natural sense coupled with assiduous observation has furnished him, I take it, with most of the skill he has. In <hi rend="italic">dyspepsia</hi> he has been his own textbook. He keeps books about him; Sydenham and Mead and Boerhaave<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Medical works of Hermann Boerhaave (<date when="1668">1668</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738">1738</date>), Dutch physician.</note> and so forth; but he never or rarely looks upon them. You will find it your best plan, I imagine, to study the elements of the science in Good and such books as he recommends; and by the time you are thoroughly master of these, you will be at no loss for scope of future effort. Your knowledge of German and French as well as Latin and Greek will be of singular use to you in the pursuit of medicine, as they are essential portions of a good education in all professions. One Book Badams often commends&#x2014;Philips&#x2019; translation of the London Pharmacopeia;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Phillips (<date when="1778">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851">1851</date>), a chemist, published his corrected edition of the <hi rend="italic">London Pharmacopoeia</hi> under the title <hi rend="italic">An experimental examination of the last edition of the Pharmacop&#x9c;ia Londinensis</hi> in London in <date when="1811">1811</date>.</note> he reckons it the best <foreign><hi rend="italic">Materia medica</hi></foreign> extant: if without a treatise of the subject, you might purchase it; the cost <pb id="pg-03-155" n="03:155"/>cannot be great.&#x2014; But independently of Badams&#x2019; or any one&#x2019;s advice, I see you are at present on the right track. To make a good physician or a good practical professor of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> science, a man must in the present age be skilled in general knowledge; and this I rejoice to see you are aware of, and sedulously acting up to. Keep on your course: let medicine be the main beam of the edifice; but neglect not the inferior timbers. Tell me about Stewart and whatever else you are doing. Persist in Homer at the easy rate you mention. To understand <hi rend="italic">two-thirds</hi> of Stewart is a fair proportion: Playfair&#x2019;s dissertation is much plainer.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John was reading Dugald Stewart. John Playfair&#x2019;s &#x201C;Dissertation on the Progress of Mathematical and Physical Sciences in Europe&#x201D; was published in the Supplement to the <hi rend="italic">Encyclop&#xe6;dia Britannica</hi>, 4th ed. (Edinburgh, <date when="1824">1824</date>).</note> In the Supplement you will find many able articles on medical and other philosophical subjects which you would do well to read. Go down and loo<supplied>[k]</supplied> at the book, a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> select for yourself. Tell me how you do: go on, and prosper!</p>
<p>But I must tell you something of myself. Badams and I go on very lovingly toget<supplied>[her. He]</supplied> calls me <hi rend="italic">philosopher</hi> by way of eminence, and I discuss and overhaul and dissect all manner of subjects with him&#x2014; A closer acquaintance diminishes the sublimity but scarcely the pleasing quality of his character. A certain tendency to paint <foreign><hi rend="italic">en beau</hi></foreign> [in glowing colors], a sort of gasconading turn in describing his own achievements and purposes is all the fault I can discover in him; his kind-heartedness, his constant activity and good humour are more and more apparent. In spite of all his <hi rend="italic">long-bow</hi> propensities (his running away with the harrows as our Father would call it) he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a man of no ordinary powers. Nor has he any particle of dishonesty in his nature, however he may talk: in fact if I admire the man less than I once expected, I like him more. Strange that so many men should say the <hi rend="italic">thing that is not</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Houyhnhnms&#x2019; expression for a lie in <hi rend="italic">Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels</hi>.</note> without perceptible temptation! Hundreds do it out of momentary vanity; Frank Dickson and many others: it is the poorest of all possible resources in this world of makeshifts; thou and I will never try it. With regard to health, it often seems to me that I am better than I have been for several years; tho&#x2019; scarcely a week passes without a relapse for a while into directly the opposite opinion. The truth is, it stands thus: I have been bephysicked and bedrugged; I have swallowed say about two <hi rend="italic">stoup-fulls</hi> of castor oil since I came hither; by all which means tho&#x2019; my carcass is rendered much clearer and purer than it was, the <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> functions of the organs are of course <pb id="pg-03-156" n="03:156"/>still more inert than formerly. Unless I dose myself with that <hi rend="italic">oil of sorrow</hi> every fourth day, I cannot get along at all. On the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> day I feel almost well; weakish indeed, but quiet and contented; my mind languid but serene. Badams declares that by persisting in my present course, physic will ultimately become superfluous, and I shall be <hi rend="italic">regularly healthy</hi>! How this may be I know not: I must even try. I have already gained some knowledge of my disease and also of the plan of treating it. Abstinence and exercise are my recipes: I must persist for a time; if I cannot recover I may at least mitigate my grievances. My resources are more numerous than they have been, and I am free to use them. Am I a man, and can do <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to ameliorate my destiny? Hang it! I will set up house in the country, and take to gardening and translating before I let it beat me.&#x2014; Birmingham has not yet tired me, tho&#x2019; I have few ties upon it; in general I am not unhappy. Of late I have begun to grudge being so long idle. <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> is almost at a stand: I have been thinking of it, and preparing improvements; but the Taylor creature is slow as a snail. I suspect little will be done till I get to London. There I expected to have been ere now: I saw Irving here; I wrote to him since stating in distant terms a proposal to <hi rend="italic">board</hi> with him thro&#x2019; winter; he has not answered me, but I expect daily that he will. If he consent, I shall go with him and Mrs Strachey to Dover (for thither they talked of going); if not, I think hardly. My better plan will be to go and take lodgings, till this pitiful book is off my hands; and then look about me farther; return to the north or stay in London as I reckon best. In ten days if you do not hear from me before, write again directing hither. Ten days hear you; not a minute longer. Rot this paltry sheet! it is done before I have said one twentieth of my say. I am shamefully in my Father&#x2019;s debt; my next letter I purpose shall be to him. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my own dear Tongleg, and all my kind and beloved Mainhillites every one <hi rend="italic">by name</hi>! <closer><salute>I am ever your affectionate Brother&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>[In margins:] Now I have spoken of ten days; but recollect I meant the ten days to be counted from <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, not above a week, after <hi rend="italic">you</hi> hear of the arrangement. Write in a small type, or any type you please, and on any subject. Tell me news of all kinds.</p>
<p>Of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> I hear little: Boyd has got it stuck into the front of his catalogue (with various eulogies) in the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and Quarterly Reviews; but he says he has still a considerable quantity on hand. I believe pretty firmly that he has cheated me out of 500 copies. Nevertheless I still expect a second edition, tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">when</hi> is not so certain. The <hi rend="italic">Opium</hi> <pb id="pg-03-157" n="03:157"/><hi rend="italic">Eater</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >De Quincey in the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi>, <date when="1824-08">Aug. 1824</date>, pp. 189 ff.; <date when="1824-09">Sept. 1824</date>, pp. 291 ff.</note> and various small deer are carping at the work; but on the whole the reception has been very far beyond what I anticipated. I have some thoughts of starting with some other of the same class by &#x26; by. Goethe has not answered my letter, but I think he will in time<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>Do you hear of Cron, and if his well-merited preferment is authentic? Where is the Child, and what says he? Tell me George Johnstone Surgeon&#x2019;s address and I will write to him. Does any body know about the Targer?</p>
<p>Tell Alick that I expect to see his hand in the next letter, and also a <hi rend="italic">line from My Mother</hi>. My heartfelt love to all&#x2014;beginning at Mag and ending at Jenny: I often paint them out in my mind, and pray for blessings on them all.</p>
<p>I saw Lichfield yesterday and Dr Sam&#x2019;s <supplied>[Johnson&#x2019;s]</supplied> house! I have also seen Warwick and Kenilworth. O for paper!</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Had it not been for the stipulation made in my last letter, I should have postponed writing for a day or two. I am at present, as it were, on the wing; detained here till I get my accoutrements for proceeding farther to the south. About a week ago I received intelligence from His Reverence<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving.</note> that all things were arranged for an excursion to the shore of Kent; to which place of bathing and rustication his wife, with a Miss Kirkpatrick a cousin of Mrs Strachey&#x2019;s, was to proceed on the following thursday, he himself with me as his second to go after them next monday. In consequence of this intelligence, I forthwith addressed myself for a ride to London; and taking leave of Badams, who strictly charged me to come back for another month till he completed his doctorial and castor-oil system with me, I left the City of Tubalcain<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Industrial Birmingham. Cf. Gen. 4:22.</note> <pb id="pg-03-158" n="03:158"/>on Thursday morning. My passage was of a mixed character. Some of Badams&#x2019; drugs had not prospered with me, and I fell below par in point of health. The morning also was damp, and the day proved rainy: to complete the matter it cleared up just when I had shifted my place to the interior of the vehicle, and exchanged the sight of High Wycomb and the lawns of Buckinghamshire, for the inane prattle of a little black-eyed, pretty, bluestocking Genevese, my sole travelling companion. So that when they set me down in Oxford-street, falsely said by the rascal guard to be the nearest point to Pentonville, from which it was three miles distant, Lad-lane being only one, I felt somewhat out of humour; a dissonance of spirit which increased to loud jarring as I followed my stout and fleet porter, who strode lustily along, under cloud of night, thro&#x2019; labyrinthine streets and alleys, with my portmanteau dangling at his back and a travelling-bag to balance it in front&#x2014;stamp, stamp amid the rattling of wains and coaches, and the unearthly cries of fruiterers, and oyster-men and piemen and all the mighty din of London&#x2014;till I verily thought he would <hi rend="italic">never</hi> reach a point of the city which my eyes had seen before. Nevertheless I had not been without my enjoyments on the road: I had got another glance of the heart of &#x201C;merry England,&#x201D; with its waving knolls, and green woody fields, and snug hamlets and antique boroughs, and jolly ale-drinking, beef-eating people. It was not without some pleasurable imaginations that I saw Stratford-upon-Avon, the very hills and woods which the boy Shakespeare had looked upon, the very church where his dust reposes, nay the very house where he was born, the threshold over which his staggering footsteps carried him in infancy, the very stones where the urchin played marbles and flogged tops. It is a small grim-looking house of bricks, bound as was of old the fashion with beams of oak intersecting the bricks, which are built into it and fill up its interstices as the glass does in a window. The old tile-roof is cast by age and twisted into all varieties of curvature: half the house has been modernized, and made&#x2014;a butcher&#x2019;s shop. The street where it stands is a simple-looking, short, every-day village street, with houses mostly new and consisting like the Shakespeare house, of two low stories, or rather a story and a half. Stratford itself is a humble pleasant-looking place, the residence as formerly of wool-combers and other quiet artisans, except where they have brought an ugly black canal into it, and polluted this classical burgh by the presence of lighters or track-boats with famished horses, sooty drivers, and heaps of coke and coal. <pb id="pg-03-159" n="03:159"/>It seems considerably larger and less showy than Annan. Shakespeare and Breakspeare and for aught I know sundry other Spears are still common names in Warwickshire: I was struck on my arrival at Birmingham by a sign not far from Badams&#x2019; indicating the abode of &#x201C;William Shakespeare, Boot-and-shoe-maker,&#x201D; which boots and shoes the modern Shakespeare also professed his ability and readiness to mend &#x201C;cheap and neatly.&#x201D; Homer, I afterwards discovered, had settled in Birmingham as a button-maker.</p>
<p>But I must not wander thus, or I never shall have done. Of Oxford, then, with its domes and spires and minarets; its rows of shady trees, and still, monastic edifices, venerable in their antique richness and intricate seclusion, I shall say nothing till I see you. I must hasten rather to observe that I found the orator at Pentonville, sitting &#x201C;sparrow-like, companionless <hi rend="italic">in</hi> (not <hi rend="italic">on</hi>) the housetop alone.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Even so, / The Sparrow so on the house-top, and I, / The weakest of God&#x2019;s creatures, stand resolved / To abide the issue of my act, alone&#x201D; (Wordsworth, <hi rend="italic">The Borderers</hi>, III, ll. <date when="1516">1516</date>&#x2013;<date when="1519">19</date>).</note> His wife had left him, and taken all the cro<supplied>[c]</supplied>kery and bedding and other household gear along with her. He extended to me the right hand of fellowship notwithstanding, and even succeeded in procuring me some genial tea with an egg only half-rotten, which for a London egg is saying much. By and by, one Hamilton a worthy and accomplished merchant from Sanquhar came in and took me with him to his lodgings and treated me comfortably; and there in a splendid bed, I contrived in spite of agitation from within and noise and bugs from without to get six hours of deep slumber. Next morning I was fitter to do business<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>On leaving Birmingham, I had felt uncertain whether I should go to Dover with the orator or not; and I had partly determined to be regulated in my yea or no by his acceptance or rejection of my proposal to board with him while in London, concerning which in his letter he had maintained a mysterious reserve. On coming to discuss the subject orally, I soon discovered that His Reverence was embarrassed by a conflicting proposal (to board at a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> high rate some medical youth from Glasgow) which was not yet decided on, and was consequently in the way of any definite arrangement with me. The good priest, for with all his vanities and affectations he is really a good man, an excellent man, as men go,&#x2014;puckered up his face and eyebrows in much distress, and was just commencing with various articulate and inarticulate preparatives, when I discovering rapidly how the matter stood, begged him to consider my proposal as <hi rend="italic">un</hi>made and never to say or even think one other word upon the subject. The puckers disappeared at this announcement; <pb id="pg-03-160" n="03:160"/>but were succeeded by a continuous cloud of gloom and regret, as he set about advising me to go with him to Dover, and to put off the consideration of lodging and all such matters till my return. After much canvassing, I assented upon the proviso of my being allowed to bear my own share of the expense, and to be his fellow-lodger not his guest. With this salvo to my pride&#x2014;which I already almost begin to despise as a piece of cold selfishness&#x2014;we struck the bargain, that he should set out on Monday, and I should follow him whenever my business was concluded, and he had written to me that right lodgings were procured. He left me this morning about six, and I expect to follow in two days.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;business&#x201D; I could have in London may well surprise you: it was (alas it is!) the most pitiful that ever man had; nothing but the collecting of a few books for the completing of my poor <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>, an ungainly task which Messrs Taylor and Hess<supplied>[e]</supplied>y had they not been infirm and irregular persons should certainly have spared me. You cannot think what trotting to and fro I have had to get a book or two of the most simple character; how I have at length fairly put the <hi rend="italic">gum-gawed habble tree</hi>, vacillating Mr Hess<supplied>[e]</supplied>y, out of the concern, and written off to Birmingham for the necessary supplies (<hi rend="italic">Schillers Werke</hi> already borrowed there) which with other helps within my reach will have to serve for my whole equipment. I am indifferently contented with these people; and feel somewhat tempted to despise them. Procter says &#x201C;they are <hi rend="italic">Booksellers</hi>, which is saying every thing.&#x201D; At all events they must pay me somewhere on the verge of &#xa3;90 down upon the nail for this book, the day when it is published; and then, if I like, I turn upon my heel (forever). The printing is to commence, whenever I come back, and may be finished in about six weeks. The additions and alterations, especially the versions from some of the tragedies, I purpose to complete in Kent; so as to be nearly altogether my own master here while it is passing thro&#x2019; the press.</p>
<p>Thus then, Jack, thou seest the present posture of my affairs. In about ten weeks from this date, I expect to be free of London, to have ascertained how it will suit me, what hopes what advantages it offers, and to decide for continuance or departure as shall seem me best. If my health improve I shall be for remaining, especially if I can fasten upon any profitable employment; if not, scarcely. About the ultimatum I am by no means low-spirited, not often even dumpish. I feel pretty confident that I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> recover my health in some considerable degree, perhaps wholly; if not here, <hi rend="italic">elsewhere</hi>; while this is in progress I can <pb id="pg-03-161" n="03:161"/>at the worst <hi rend="italic">translate</hi> for the London or Edinburgh market; and if I were <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, I feel that some considerable desire to write might arise within me, I might like Archy Halliday<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly an Annandale person about whom a laughable story had circulated.</note> &#x201C;fin&#x2019; a kind of inclination to <hi rend="italic">bark</hi>,&#x201D; and certainly there is no want of game. A miserable scrub of an author sharking and writing &#x201C;articles&#x201D; about Town, like Hazzlitt, Dequincey and that class of living creatures, is a thing which as our <supplied>[Fa]</supplied>ther says, I <hi rend="italic">canna</hi> [<hi rend="italic">can</hi> underscored twice] be. Nor shall I need it: I have fifty better schemes. As to not boarding <supplied>[wi]</supplied>th Irving I hardly regret it now that it is past. His house would scarcely have been a favourable place for studying any science but the state of religion in general and that of the Caledonian chapel in particular, as managed by various doers, delegates and other most nondescript personages; a very affected and not beautiful sister of his wife&#x2019;s is also to stay with them through the winter; her I might have found it a task to love. &#x201C;Pray Mr Carlyle&#x201D; said she in a mincing namby-pamby tone, the night she arrived, when I was sitting with my powers of patience screwed to the sticking place, being in truth very miserable and very much indisposed to make complaints, &#x201C;Pray Mr Carlyle are you <hi rend="italic">really</hi> sick now, or is it only fanciful?&#x201D; &#x201C;Fancy, Ma&#x2019;am, fancy, nothing more,&#x201D; said I half turning round, and immediately proceeding with some other topic addressed to some other member of the company.&#x2014; Besides Irving has a squeaking brat of a son, &#x201C;who indeed brings us many blessings, <hi rend="italic">but</hi> rather interrupts our rest at nights&#x201D;! Bad luck to his blessings&#x2014;compared with natural rest!&#x2014; In short I shall be more completely master in my own lodgings; more at liberty to follow out the Badamean system of diet, and this with me is an immense matter. As for company I shall have enough when I please to go and seek it; and for the discomforts of a lodging, I am getting less and less dependent on them; noise now does not half so much distress me. I doubt not I shall do rarely in my own small way.</p>
<p>Ere long thou too Jack wilt be moving into city quarters; I trust under happy omens for thy bodily and mental good. Many a time I think of thee, and thy generous unabating pursuit of knowledge, and thy faithful, unpretending, affectionate heart, which all the <hi rend="italic">logic</hi> in the world cannot hide. Courage my own Tongleg! The day will yet be ours. Diligence guided, and in thy case restrained, by Prudence will equip a far meaner man: let us behave like true-spirited fellows, and fear nothing! These things I have often written already; but I write them again, knowing that thou hast none to communicate with but me, and <pb id="pg-03-162" n="03:162"/>hoping to give thee a moment&#x2019;s pleasure by the expression of my heartfelt sympathy. I wish you would write me a large account of all your straits and difficulties: for the last two years my own life has been so perplexed and encumbered with unutterable vexations that I have had far too little time to devote to you and yours. If ever I recover the condition of an ordinary mortal, I hope I shall have less to apologize for: that my affection to you never wavered you need not be assured. Write to me as to a brother, who believes and hopes that nothing shall part us thro&#x2019; life.</p>
<p>Along with the history of your own studies and feelings, you must send me that of all the perceptibly important occurrences at home. To me they can never be indifferent. How is my Mother? Does she still abide by her regimen, and prosper by it? Get her a little more wine to take a glass of <hi rend="italic">before</hi> dinner: the sort they call <hi rend="italic">cape</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wine from the Cape of Good Hope.</note> is sometimes wholesome enough, more so than any other, and it is the cheapest. I need not send my warmest affection; she knows it is always with her.&#x2014; I meant to write our Father; but I thought some other subject might be more interesting to him: I purpose writing to him from the Kentish shore. What is Alick busy with? Gathering in the stuff, and getting it covered from the elements. He and I are yet to farm in concert; I as sleeping (or rather riding) partner, he head-<hi rend="italic">man</hi>. I send my best affection to every soul at home; to Mag, who never writes or tells me one syllable of her feelings, to Jamie and Mary and the two small black-eyed school-women; tell them they are all precious in my sight. I would gladly know their history, so far as writing can communicate it. But before expecting even the possibility of this, I myself must write again communicating my <hi rend="italic">address</hi>. Send the paper down to me at the regular time (friday) directed to me, Post-office, Dover; and I will go and ask for it; then be in readiness to write me an immense detail. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Jack!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dearest Eliza</salute>
<p>I promised to write to you as soon as I was settled&#x2014; &#x201C;Lord how this world is given to lying!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Falstaff&#x2019;s speech, <hi rend="italic">I Henry IV</hi>, V, iv.</note>&#x2014; I have been settled now near a month, and you are still without your letter. <foreign>Eh bien</foreign>! fortunately for me, you are to<supplied>[o]</supplied> good to get <hi rend="italic">crumpy</hi>.</p>
<p>The Fates have been indifferently kind to me since we parted: during the two weeks my Cousin<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Capt. James Baillie.</note> staid with us I never wearied once; I played chess or <foreign>ecart&#xE9;</foreign> with him; paid morning visits with him; strolled thro&#x2019; the woods and fields with him; or sat on a green bank, and talked sentiment with him. You will stare to hear of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baillie talking sentiment: I assure you nevertheless this man with mustaches and four rings on his fingers is as sentimental as the Prince of Denmark. But it is only in confidential intercourse that he lays aside his dress-manner of indifference and suffers all the sensibility of his heart to appear: even then he seems to take pleasure in gainsaying his nature&#x2014;often in our conversations when his imagination had risen to the highest pitch, when his fine eyes full of tears, and the melancholy, impassioned tones of his voice showed he was ready to be overpowered by his feelings; he would start away to some theme of ridicule or folly, and efface the impression he had just made, with the laugh of a mephistopheles. How ill I understood him before we came here: his character has received such a fictitious colouring from the associations to which it has been exposed that it might well deceive so unpractised an observer as I am! &#x201C;You were sure that he was not a person at all to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> taste&#x201D;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Lord help your simplicity!</hi> how you mistook the matter! He is my very <hi rend="italic">beau <pb id="pg-03-164" n="03:164"/>ideal</hi> in all respects but one: his nature is the most affectionate I ever knew, his spirit the most magnificent; he has a clear, quick intellect, a lively fancy: with beauty, brilliance, sensibility, native gracefulness, and courtly polish, he wants but <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> to be&#x2014;the destiny of my life! What a pity that heaven should have denied him this <foreign><hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi></foreign>! or rather what a mercy! for he will soon be married (I suppose) to that vexatious &#x201C;somebody&#x201D;; and I have not, like my &#x2018;unfortunate&#x2019; namesake in the song, any fancy for dangling in my garters. Well! I begin to think men and women may be very alarming without having any <hi rend="italic">genius</hi>: Who knows but I shall grow reasonable at last? descend from my ideal heaven to the real prose earth, marry, and&#x2014;Oh Plato!&#x2014;make a pudding! I do not say puddings, for sure I am the first would be the death of me.</p>
<p><foreign>Eh bien!</foreign> happen what may, I do not think I shall ever be M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Benjamin Bell&#x2014; Oh Jupiter! that broad brimmed hat, and calico great-coat! I shall never forget how he looked! so different from the long-cherished picture of him in my mind!&#x2014; And so the meeting I so much desired has dispelled the illusion of more than two years! Do you know the vulgar cast of his countenance and the volley of nonsense he overwhelmed me with, gave a shock to my nervous system which it did not recover for four and twenty hours&#x2014;indeed to this day I turn sick at heart when I think of him. <foreign>Mais n&#x2019;importe</foreign>! [But it doesn&#x2019;t matter!] it is only one more spanish castle demolished; another may start up like a mushroom in its place.</p>
<p>I long for the last week of October; tho&#x2019; I like the country better this season than I ever did before. Our <hi rend="italic">popularity</hi> here is not a whit diminished; which is rather to be wondered at, as we are no novelty now. Ever since M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baillie went away we have been &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">on the transit from one friend&#x2019;s house to another</hi>&#x201D;: and as our acquaintances here are, for the most part, pleasant people, and see a deal of good company, I have no doubt that, could I be happy in idleness, I should find my present mod<supplied>[e]</supplied> of life agreeable enough. But the thought that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">life is short and, art is long</hi>&#x201D; will not leave me at rest in idleness, it flashes upon my mind in the midst of amusement, and turns &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">earth&#x2019;s vain, fading, vulgar show</hi>&#x201D; to weariness and vexation of spirit&#x2014; The Menteith family have been wonderfully <hi rend="italic">affectionate</hi> to me since I came here. The eldest son and daughter are amiable, intelligent, and particularly pleasing in their manners. Miss Menteith reads German and is almost as fond of it as I am. The rest I hardly like.

<salute>My dear Father,</salute>
<p>I engaged to send you a letter so soon as I had reached the coast: I have been here four days, and I now proceed to fulfil my engagement. Our movements are not yet altogether ended; we have already shifted our lodging once, and shall have to shift it again this week when Mrs Strachey<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Edward Strachey, born Julia Kirkpatrick, was the wife of an Examiner in the India Office who worked with James Mill and Thomas Love Peacock. There is a portrait of Edward Strachey in Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>. Some of the Stracheys&#x2019; sons, particularly Sir Edward Strachey, became Carlyle&#x2019;s lifelong friends. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240610-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1824-06-10">10 June</date></ref>.</note> arrives; so that being in a state of partial fluctuation I must not be expected to give you any very definite details of the objects surrounding and concerning me: but at least I shall communicate the <pb id="pg-03-166" n="03:166"/>name of my abode that you may be able to write to me, and assure you of my welfare which is the main value of all my letters.</p>
<p>In Jack&#x2019;s epistle, which you must have received some days ago, I brought down my history, with some minuteness, to the time of my expected departure from London: that sheet of intelligence had not crossed the Trent, when I received my packet of books from Birmingham, with a notice from the Orator that all was ready for me here. In consequence I mounted the Canterbury Coach and proceeded to my destination. I had been agreeably enough situated in the Wen (as Cobbett calls London), yet I was not lo<supplied>[a]</supplied>th to exchange its tumults for the clear atmosphere and wholesome quiet of the country; so I journeyed with no unpleasant feelings thro&#x2019; the green fields and waving downs of Kent, across Dartford, Rochester, Chatham and Canterbury, and finally along to this corner of the sea-girt land, where I arrived in the dusk of a bright and sharp autumnal day. There has been no fixed arrangement in our plans as yet. Mrs Irving with her infant had come down hither with a Miss Kirkpatrick<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Aurora (&#x201C;Kitty&#x201D;) Kirkpatrick, later Mrs. James W. Phillipps, was one of those entering into the composite of Blumine, heroine of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>. Her father was James Achilles Kirkpatrick, brother of William Kirkpatrick, the father of Mrs. Strachey; and her mother was a Begum, an Indian Princess. Much of the Oriental symbolism associated with Blumine is related to her. She corresponded with Carlyle throughout a long life. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240610-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1824-06-10">10 June</date></ref>.</note> a cousin of Mrs Strachey&#x2019;s, in whose hired house we are all living, till the rest of the party arrive, when it is understood that the Irvings and I shall evacuate the place and seek lodgings of our own, it being reckoned unsuitable for the young lady to be left in the house alone till her other friends arrive, and there not being room enough to hold us and them. Irving and I, however, have established ourselves at our desks and are scribbling away, as if we were to live here for half an age. I expect to be very snug and comfortable while here: the seabathing seems to agree as well with me as ever, and the people are all anxious to treat me as a kind of established invalid, whose concerns are to be attended to as a prime object. This young Miss Kirkpatrick, with whom I was already acquainted, is a very pleasant and meritorious person, one of the kindest and most modest I have ever seen. tho&#x2019; handsome and young and sole mistress of fifty thousand pounds, she is meek and unassuming as a little child: she laughs in secret at the awkward extravagances of the Orator, yet she loves him as a good man, and busies herself with nothing so much as discharging the duties of hospitality to us all. I believe <pb id="pg-03-167" n="03:167"/>there is something Asiatic in the girl: her mother was an Indian Princess, and much of the quietude and contemplative imagining of that people is visible in the daughter. Of Irving I have much kindness towards me to record: I like the man as I did of old, without respecting him much less or more. He has a considerable turn for displays&#x2014;which in reality are sheer vanity, tho&#x2019; he sincerely thinks them the perfection of Christian elevation; but in these things he indulges very sparingly before me; and any little glimpses of them that do occur I find it easy without the slightest ill-nature arising between us, to repress. We talk of religion and literature and men and things, and stroll about and smoke cigars, a choice stock of which he has been presented with by some friend. I reckon him much improved since winter: the fashionable people have totally left him, yielding like feathers and flying chaff to some new &#x201C;centre of attraction&#x201D;; the newspapers also are silent; and he begins to see that there was really nothing supernatural in the former hurly-burly, but that he must content himself with patient well-doing and liberal tho&#x2019; not immoderate success; not taking the world by one fierce onslaught, but by patient and continued sapping and mining as others do. I for one am sincerely glad that matters have taken this change: I consider him a man of splendid gifts and good intentions, and likely in his present manner of proceeding to be of much benefit to the people among whom he labours. His &#x201C;Isabella&#x201D; also is a good honest-hearted person, and an excellent wife. She is very kind to me; and tho&#x2019; without any notable gifts of mind or manners or appearance, contrives to be in general extremely agreeable. Irving and she are sometimes ridiculous enough at present in the matter of their son; a quiet <foreign><hi rend="italic">wersh gorb</hi></foreign> [an insipid, always hungry young bird] of a thing, as all children of six weeks are, but looked upon by them as if it were a cherub from on high. The concerns of &#x201C;him&#x201D; (as they emphatically call it) occupy a large share of public attention. Kitty Kirkpatrick smiles covertly, and I laugh aloud, at the earnest devotedness of the good orator to this weighty affair. &#x201C;Isabella,&#x201D; said he the other night, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> would wash him, I think, with <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> water to-night&#x201D;; a counsel received with approving assent by the mother, but somewhat objected to by others. I declared the washing and dressing of &#x201C;him&#x201D; to be the wife&#x2019;s concern alone, and that were I in her place, I would wash &#x201C;him&#x201D; with oil of vitriol, if I pleased, and take no one&#x2019;s counsel on it.&#x2014; When Mrs Strachey arrives I expect some accession of enjoyment. She has taken a great liking to me, and is any way a singularly worthy woman. I had a very kind note from her this very day.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-168" n="03:168"/>Of the country about this neighbourhood I have not yet seen much. Kent is a delightful region; fertile and well cultivated; watered with clear streams, sufficiently and not excessively besprinkled with trees, and beautifully broken with inequalities of surface, among which the white chalk cliffs are frequently conspicuous. The whole county rests upon chalk: they burn this mineral in kilns and use it as lime. In its native state, it lies in immense masses, all divided into strata or courses, of various thickness, by immense multitudes of lumps of flint distributed among it in parallel seams. The chalk itself is of a dim white, is soft as <hi rend="italic">quarry-damp</hi>, when taken from the ground, but hardens on exposure to the air. Much of it is hewed or rather chipped, with a kind of two-edged axe, into square blocks, and used as building stone. The husbandry in Kent is beyond that of many counties in England; but a Scottish farmer would smile at many parts of it. They plough with <hi rend="italic">five</hi> horses and two men (one <hi rend="italic">ca&#x2019;ing</hi>); and the plough has wheels! Many a time have I thought of Alick with his Lothian tackle, and two horses, setting these inefficient loiterers to the right about. Yet here they are much better than in Warwi<supplied>[c]</supplied>kshire, where farming may be said to be an unknown art; where the fields are sometimes of half an acre, and of all possible shapes but square, and a threshing mill is a thing nearly utterly unheard of. Here a fifth part of the surface is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> covered with gigantic and ill-kept fences; but they grow their wheat and their beans and their hops (a peculiar product) on more rational principles. In all cases, however, the people seem to realize a goodly share of solid comfort; the English hind has his pork (often raw) or his beef, with ale and wheaten bread three times a-day, and wears a ruddy and substantial look, see him where you will. I have looked into the clean brick-built, tile-flagged, little cottages, and seen the people dining, with their jug of ale, their bacon and other ware, and a huge loaf like a stithy-clog towering over it all. It is pleasant to see every one so well provided for: there is nothing like the appearance of want to be met with anywhere.&#x2014; This <supplied>[Dover]</supplied> is a <hi rend="italic">douce</hi>, ancient, cleanly burgh, built in a niche of the high chalk cliffs which to<supplied>[wer]</supplied> against the billows of the ocean for several miles to the east and west. It stands in the bottom of a crevice or break in this white and massive wall (in general some hundreds of feet in height), which seems to have been hollowed out in the course of distant ages by a brook about the size of Mien, which now assists to form the harbour. It is built somewhat in the form of a capital <figure><graphic url="g3-1.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure>, the broadest part (<figure><graphic url="g3-2.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure>) fronting to the flinty beach of the sea, with the tail extending a mile up the rivulet; the old grey flinty castle rising on the top of <pb id="pg-03-169" n="03:169"/>the cliff to the left or east, the houses on the right or west actually joining by supplemental roofs with the perpendicular wall of chalk. It seems to contain about 10,000 inhabitants; is full of revenue officers and sailors and passengers, and soldiers to man the castle and fortifications with which the whole coast is provided. We can see France any ordinary day, distant about twenty-one miles. From the beach it has the look of three <hi rend="italic">Barhills</hi> laid on the tails of one another somewhat in this way (<figure><graphic url="g3-3.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure>); then a little hillock to the west, then another. Steam packets cross every day: the eggs which my fair landlady provides for me, are <hi rend="italic">laid</hi> in that hostile country.</p>
<p>Thus, my dear Father, have I given you a kind of sketch of the objects that surround me; willing that you might be able to conceive my situation accurately. Of my ulterior views I have already spoken all that I know with certainty. It is in fact of little use to speculate on distant contingencies; the true way is to discharge the duty well that is among our hands, and be ready to discharge the next that comes to hand. The present duty with me is to get this little Book prepared for the press; and with that I design to keep myself busy while here. I have got my whole array of materials gathered round me, and doubt not I shall have it ready against my return to London. After that, I shall be at liberty to look about me, and guide myself according to circumstances.</p>
<p>You need not doubt that I am anxious for news from home; to hear how you all fare, and what occurrences diversify the course of your lives at Mainhill. What a blessing for me that you are all spared in the enjoyment of moderate health and contentedness! I am fortunate in this respect beyond many of my fellows. Alick told me something about your having some views on the Mainholm farm; I should like extremely to see you settled in some such place, if you judged it prudent; Mainhill is far too laborious, and in its present state has many discomforts. You must tell me more about this matter: all the stock of cash that I possess, you know, is at your service; there is no danger of my replacing it speedily by farther exertions.</p>
<p>To-morrow I partly expect my paper at the post-office; and shall eagerly look for a letter afterwards. Jack is my goodly scribe and will not fail me; but from you also I expect ere long a line or two, if it were but for the sight of your name at the bottom. My mother sent me a pretty little note some time ago; she must not forget to do the same again. Tell her I consider myself as getting better in my health, and have no warmer wish than to know that hers is also improving. Jack <pb id="pg-03-170" n="03:170"/>must describe minutely how she is; and be sure that she wants nothing that might even have a chance of doing her good. Her life among us, as well as yours, has been one of labour and continued effort for our interests: it would be hard if any thing that our exertions could procure should be witheld. I send my unabated love to all my brothers and sisters great and small. Alick owes me a letter: Jack must lose no day till he writes. I need not add that I am always&#x2014;<closer><salute>Your affectionate son&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>Thomas Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My Dear,</salute>
<p>I am sure if you knew with what eagerness I look for your letters, you would take a pleasure in writing to me more frequently. For some hours after a letter from you arrives, there are few happier men in England than I: the distresses and vexations that keep up almost a perpetual firing in my inward world, making me in general the dreariest and sulkiest person in the parish, for a while withdraw their black squadrons; the sun of hope comes forth in vernal beauty, and light and affection and peace hover over the scenes of my imagination. Is it you that are an enchantress or I that am weakling? Neither: it is simply that we love one another; and that love and kindly feelings even in this world can make crooked things straight and rough places plain.</p>
<p>Your last letter found me on a quiet Sunday morning at Birmingham, meditating a speedy departure to the south. Had I answered it then, as I at first proposed, I should have written with much more composure and singleness of mind than I can hope to do at present; but preparations and arrangements violently displaced my purpose; and ever since my inward like my outward man has been hurried in speedy vehicles from place to place, without leisure to think of Jane or any thing so precious to me, with the smallest continuity. I had ugly weather for my London journey; I passed thro&#x2019; Stratford upon Avon, I saw the house where the infant Shakespear was cradled, the very pavement where he spun his tops; I looked also upon the old <pb id="pg-03-171" n="03:171"/>monastic domes and minarets of Oxford; but sick nerves and pelting rain were fast banishing all romance from my feelings; I at length retired from the &#x201C;roof&#x201D; of the conveniency, postponing the picturesque to the comfortable; was annoyed to death by the cackle of a French blue-stocking, and arrived at Pentonville in a state of mind truly sulphureous. The good Orator was sitting like a bittern by the pools of water; Isabella with Miss Kirkpatrick and &#x201C;him&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Irving baby.</note> (not your <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, but one whom I have since known to my cost) had set out for Dover, carrying all the household gear along with them, and leaving the venerable Pastor in the desolation as of a sacked city, to follow them two days afterwards. I had books to get and much pitiful business to settle with Turks of Booksellers; so I did not follow him till last Thursday, and it is yet scarce two days since I recovered any thing like my usual frame of mind. The strange sights and the much cattle I have seen, I refer [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] speaking of till we meet face to face, when I will tell you every thing in all its breadth and length. My own small circle of present objects and present occupations is all I can undertake on paper.</p>
<p>We are here a very social and prospectively a very pleasant party. The strength of our forces, however, is not yet arrived. Mrs Strachey and her husband and <hi rend="italic">suite</hi> do not come till Thursday, when some new disposition of our quarters will be necessary, and time must elapse before we are all settled on a proper footing. For the present, we are all Miss Kirkpatrick&#x2019;s guests; that young lady, Mrs Strachey&#x2019;s cousin, having gone before to convey &#x201C;Isabella,&#x201D; and provide a house, and now not judging it suitable to be left there till her friends arrive. This Kitty is a singular and very pleasing creature; a little black-eyed, auburn-haired, brunette, full of kindliness and humour, and who never I believe was angry at any creature for a moment in her life. tho&#x2019; twenty-one, and not unbeautiful, and sole mistress of herself and fifty thousand pounds, she is meek and modest as a quakeress; with a demure eye she surveys the extravaganzas of the Orator, laughing at him in secret, yet loving him as a good man, and studiously devoting herself with a diverting earnestness to provide for the household cares of the establishment. Good Kitty! It is like pitchy darkness between rosy-fingered morn and tallow candle-light, when I stroll with her, the daughter of Asiatic pomp and dreamy indolence, and the Fife Isabella, skilful in Presbyterian philosophy and the structure of dumplings and worsted hose; spreading my unrestful imaginations <pb id="pg-03-172" n="03:172"/>over these chalk cliffs and the far-sounding ocean and the distant coast of France, as I have done over other scenes as lovely. Would, you or I were half as happy as this girl! But her mother was a Hindoo princess (whom her father fought for and scaled walls for);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Sir Edward Strachey (<date when="1812">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1901">1901</date>), &#x201C;The Romantic Marriage of Major James Achilles Kirkpatrick,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, CLIV (<date when="1893-07">July 1893</date>), 18&#x2013;29.</note> it lies in the blood; and philosophy can do little to help us.</p>
<p>The Orator is busy writing, and bathing, persuading himself that he is scaling the very pinnacles of Christian sentiment, which in truth with him are little more than the very pinnacles of human vanity rising thro&#x2019; an atmosphere of great native warmth and generosity. We have many and long confabulations: I find him much as he was before, and I suppose will always be; overspread with secret affectations, secret to himself, but kind and friendly and speculative and discursive as ever. You will have much to tolerate and much that will amuse you when you see him. It would do your heart good to look at him in the character of dry nurse to his first-born Edward! It is a feeble, shapeless slut<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A term of mild disrespect for a child. See the <hi rend="italic">OED</hi>.</note> of a thing, as all children of six weeks are; yet Isabella and her spouse could not be more attentive to the infant Lama, were they high priestess and priest of Thibet. The waking and the sleeping and all the operations of &#x201C;him&#x201D; (as they emphatically name it) form a most important item in the general weal. &#x201C;Isabella,&#x201D; said he, &#x201C;I think, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would wash him with <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> water to-night?&#x201D; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Yes, Deer</hi>,&#x201D; said the compliant Isabella; Kitty smirked in secret; and I made bold to dissent totally from the suggestion; declaring that in my view this was the wife&#x2019;s concern alone, and that were I in her place I would wash him with oil of vitriol, if I pleased, and take no one&#x2019;s counsel on it. Oh that you saw the giant with his broad-brimmed hat, his sallow visage, and sable matted fleece of hair, carrying the little pepper-box of a creature, folded in his monstrous palms, along the beach; tick-ticking to it, and dandling it, and every time it stirs an eye-lid, &#x201C;grinning horrible a ghastly smile,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to Death in <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 846.</note> heedless of the crowds of petrified spectators, that turn round in long trains gazing in silent terror at the fatherly Leviathan! You would laugh for twelve months after, every time you thought of it. And yet it is very wrong to laugh if one could help it; nature is very lovely, pity she should ever be absurd. On the whole I am pleased with Irving; and hope to love him and admire him and laugh at him as long as I live.</p>
<p>But enough of him, for once! Let me turn to one far dearer. I rejoice <pb id="pg-03-173" n="03:173"/>to hear that you have found a pleasing companion for your rustication; I hope that he will prove as true a friend as you anticipate. In one point, I shall be his debtor deeply, if he do as he proposes: do make him carry you to London, and the south! It is a project that promises abundantly, and seems so easy of execution. For you it will be amusing and instructive to see so many novelties physical, intellectual and moral; for me it will be delightful to know that you are near me, to see you and speak with you and shew you many wonders, as I hope to do in spite of all the artificial barriers with which you will be girt about among your fashionable friends. The gay world will interest your spirit of observation, but not your heart or its affections. That is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the goal towards which your ardent tho&#x2019; unguided enthusiasm has all along been striving: if you marry any of these fritters of perfumery and small sarcasm, I will go far to shake hands with you for good! A fashionable wife is not perhaps more worthless than most wives are; but one views her with less toleration; she <hi rend="italic">might be</hi> so much and <hi rend="italic">is</hi> so very little. Nor in spite of your gay cousin&#x2019;s objections must you cut the poor Orator: he confidently expects you, he loves you, and his fellowship will do you good. His affectations can not infect your clear and active spirit for an instant; and there is a fund of sincerity in his life and character, which in these heartless aimless days, is doubly precious. The cant of religion, conscious or unconscious, is a pitiable thing, but not the most pitiable; it often rests upon a groundwork of genuine earnest feeling; and is, I think, in all except its very worst phases, preferable to that poor arid spirit of contemptuous <hi rend="italic">persifflage</hi>, which forms the staple of fashionable accomplishment, so far as I can discern it, and spreads like a narcotic drench over all the better faculties of the soul in those that entertain it. No, my dearest, that will not do for you! Nature meant you for more serious things, and in spite of all your wanderings, you will yet attain them. O that I had power to form you and form your destiny according to my image of what you should be! O that I were a sovereign and a sage!&#x2014; O that I were not a fool! What have I ever done for you, I often ask; and there is a most beggarly account, by way of answer! I have loved you three-fourths for my own sake: it is only in stern solemn hours that you seem to me like a little <hi rend="italic">Mignon</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mignon, an enigmatic girl in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi>, perplexes the protagonist exceedingly, as Jane does Carlyle here.</note> struggling with a wild etherial ardour for the heavenly things, which you know not, and the coarse world will not let you know; and I call bitterly on Fate to put it in my <pb id="pg-03-174" n="03:174"/>power, once, once, to set you on the right path, and help you in a contest so unequal. But what avails it? Fate is deaf and dead; and we remain shut up among the grim battlements of Necessity; and time flies over us, and we are not delivered! I often wonder that you plague yourself with me for another week. My affection for you is sincere; but it has little other value. You have more faith than I, or I should have lost you long ago.</p>
<p>Indeed, my love, I will not scold you a jot. I know you will take to better courses, whenever opportunity is given you; and in the mean time, many things may be studied that are not written upon books. Enjoy yourself as much as you can; assured that time enough is in store, when difficulties may be absent and enjoyments no longer offered. You promise to study the duties of wifehood; which I assure you, are not confined to the gift of pudding making, yet are wide enough in their extent: have you yet mastered them? We shall see when you arrive.&#x2014; My own need of scolding is far greater than yours; unless it were pity or contempt that you substituted for scolding. I have been very idle, even now I am not very busy, and my health if recovering at all is recovering with due deliberation. Nevertheless I believe I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> manage ultimately: long years of constant pain have taught me that before all other things I must subdue disease, and to this I will direct my efforts till it is subdued; a consummation which I can and will bring about, cost what it like. I think of many plans: sometimes I am for the country, and a life of mingled rustication, riding, gardening, love and literature! Meanwhile I am translating fragments of <hi rend="italic">Don Karlos</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Maid of Orleans</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Schiller&#x2019;s plays.</note> the paltry <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> being, after some sharp speech on my part, at last determined to go to press immediately on my return to Town. Will you translate me <hi rend="italic">Hero and Leander</hi>?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Schiller&#x2019;s poem. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241204-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1824-12-04">4 Dec.</date></ref></note> Check <hi rend="italic">any</hi> other that you like better; only try. I will tell you more next time, if this answer not.&#x2014;&#x2014; Of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> I have seen no review worth calling by the name; tho&#x2019; it has been puffed and praised in various quarters, and has met with a reception far beyond what I anticipated.

I have not yet read his &#x201C;Article,&#x201D; at least not farther than a hasty glance at the three first leaves: but I design to do it; tho&#x2019; the man seems ill-bred in his remarks, and sufficiently shallow, there may be a grain of information in that dusty chaff, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">fas <pb id="pg-03-175" n="03:175"/>et ab hoste doceri</hi></foreign>.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is right to learn, even from an enemy.

Ovid&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi>, IV, 428.</note> On the whole, to be reviewed, I find, is a mighty simple matter; one of Badams&#x2019; emollients is as bad as fifty &#x201C;articles.&#x201D;&#x2014;Now you prom<supplied>[ised]</supplied> a large batch of news: when, pray, am I to have it? Do, write immediately, and at <hi rend="italic">exceeding great</hi> length. Tell me about your journey hitherward, about all you think of or care for. For this once I have done: <closer><salute>farewell, my Dearest! <foreign><hi rend="italic">vale et me ama</hi></foreign> [farewell and love me]! I am your&#x2019;s forever,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>&#x201C;My Dear&#x201D;&#x2014;</salute>I do think I should have gone demented if your letter had not come on monday&#x2014; While little Jock was away at the Post-office, I had out my watch at least fifty times; and when I saw him coming along the road, my heart beat so loud, you might have heard it at Dover&#x2014; Why do you put my patience so often to the test? You know well enough it is not my most abundant virtue&#x2014; You are continually chiding me for writing seldom: I am sure I have reason to complain of you on the same account; and this laziness is more inexcusable in you than in me. In the midst of new scenes and new friends, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have a thousand pleasures independent of my letters; but it is very different with me&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have no pleasure in life but what your letters af<supplied>[f]</supplied>ord me&#x2014; Do think of this!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I congratulate you on your present situation. With such a picture of domestic felicity before your eyes, and this &#x201C;singular and very pleasing creature&#x201D; to charm away the blue devils, you can hardly fail to be as happy as the day is long. Miss Kitty Kirkpatrick&#x2014; Lord what an ugly name! &#x201C;Good Kitty!&#x201D; Oh! pretty dear delightful Kitty! I am not a bit jealous of her&#x2014;not I indeed&#x2014;Hindoo Princess tho&#x2019; she be! Only you may as well never let me hear you mention her name again&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wonder when <hi rend="italic">I</hi> shall see this delightful &#x201C;South,&#x201D; where every body finds friends&#x2014; From what my Cousin writes to me, his marriage seems likely to hang some time in the wind&#x2014; When it does take place, who knows that his <hi rend="italic">dear Charlotte</hi> will approve our project? I fear there is nothing certain to hope for from <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. The Orator, you say, expects me. I am willing to b<supplied>[e]</supplied>lieve he does. But the Orator has only <pb id="pg-03-176" n="03:176"/><hi rend="italic">one</hi> voice in the matter; his wife has the other; and his wife I have obliged too deeply to hope for kindness from her. Depend upon it&#x2014;the Orator&#x2019;s good intentions towards me will evaporate next season as they did the last&#x2014; When the time for my visit arrives, his house will still be &#x201C;unfit for the accommodation of a Lady&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Well! if I do not go, I shall derive at least <hi rend="italic">one</hi> advantage from my disappointment; I shall escape the danger of becoming &#x201C;a fashionable Wife&#x201D; Oh thou Goose! to fancy for an instant that I could end in this! If I marry a fine Gentleman you will have nothing more to say to me&#x2014; Are you mad &#x201C;Dear&#x201D;? Has Miss Kitty Kirkpatrick turned your head? Really, I should just as soon think of marrying some inhabitant of the Frozen Regions, who could not exist out of a climate which I should shiver to death in; who could speak nothing but a strange tongue which I did not understand, and had no capacity for acquiring&#x2014; A fashionable Wife? Oh never will I be anything so heartless! I have pictured for myself a far higher destiny than this&#x2014; Will it ever be more than a picture? Shall I ever have the wish of my heart fulfilled? a &#x2018;sweet home&#x2019; calmly embosomed in some romantic vale; with wealth enough to realize my ideal of elegant comfort; with books, statues, paintings all things suitable to a tasteful, intellectual manner of life; with the friendship and society of a few, whose conversation would improve the faculties of my head and heart and with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> to be the polar star of my being&#x2014;one warmhearted, highminded <hi rend="italic">dearest</hi> Friend, whose sublime Genius would shed an ennobling influence on all around him; whose graceful and splendid qualities would inspire a love that should be the heart and soul of my life! Such happiness is possible, and alas! it is next to impossible to assemble the circumstances which compose it. But <foreign><hi rend="italic">nil desperandum</hi></foreign> [let there be no despair]&#x2014;my motto is &#x2018;Hope&#x2019;&#x2014;</p>
<p>And much need have I, at present, to keep it in my mind&#x2019;s eye that I may behave with becoming philosophy&#x2014; My life is a continual sacrificing of my inclinations and opinions, for peace&#x2019;s sake; and there is no peace after all! <foreign>Eh bien</foreign>! if it please God to spare me till after the Festival, I shall take a course different from any I have followed hitherto&#x2014; Hero and Leander&#x2014;I will try it as soon as I am settled; but at present I am too idle to have time to open a book&#x2014; <foreign>Grace &#xE0; Dieu</foreign>! I go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Monday&#x2014; My Mother joins me there about a fortnight hence, with her <foreign>prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;</foreign> Miss Gilchrist. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> is to stay with us all winter! and I am to be her governess, it seems&#x2014; So my Mother has arranged it; and I cannot say that I am particularly delighted with <pb id="pg-03-177" n="03:177"/>the prospect&#x2014; Catherine Gilchrist is a very good little girl in her way; but she is no <hi rend="italic">companion</hi> for me: and as a <hi rend="italic">pupil</hi> she will be a grievous tax upon my time. Besides, her being with us will be a continual pretext for her Brother&#x2019;s visits; and I find her Brother is a fool, whom one cannot see too seldom. Only think after he left Haddington, he insisted with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baillie that I had <hi rend="italic">flaxen</hi> hair! And this is not his only offence: he pesters me with nonsensical, whining, ill-spellt letters&#x2014; However there is no remedy. My Mother is so extravagantly fond of this white-haired couple, that she seems to have no aim in existence at present but to serve them&#x2014; The only comfort I have is a faint hope that Doctor Fyffe may knock M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Gilchrist&#x2019;s brains out; and be hanged himself for the murder&#x2014; I should thus be quit of two very great plagues at once.</p>
<p>You must know the poor little Doctor is as jealous of me still as if we were man and wife&#x2014; when he saw the Highlander day after day going into our house and coming out of it; he could not ma<supplied>[i]</supplied>ntain his majestic silence any longer. He wrote to me in his usual mock-heroic strain, imploring that I would <hi rend="italic">meet him&#x2014;curse him</hi>&#x2014;and part <hi rend="italic">with him for ever</hi>&#x2014; I could have indulged him in all this without putting any great violence on my feelings; but, you know, you had prohibited me from <hi rend="italic">swearing</hi> upon any account. Moreover he reminded me of a <hi rend="italic">vow</hi> which he had made in one of his paroxysms of despair&#x2014;<foreign>videlicet</foreign>, that if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would not marry him he would never marry another&#x2014;and it seemed as if he would fain persuade me that &#x201C;this sacred oath, tho&#x2019; sworn by one had bound us both&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Byron&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Bride of Abydos,&#x201D; I, 349&#x2013;50.</note> for he says, after heaping imprecations on his own head, that but for him I might <hi rend="italic">live&#x2014;love another&#x2014;and be happy</hi>&#x2014; You may believe, I was greatly astonished to find that such serious matters as my <hi rend="italic">life</hi> and <hi rend="italic">happiness</hi> depended on D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fyffe! Poor little Man! he really gave me credit for more humanity than I possessed&#x2014; I was never once discomposing myself about either him or his &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">vow</hi>.&#x2019; And so I told him, in my answer to his letter, assuring him at the same <supplied>[time]</supplied> that he was quite at liberty to marry whomsoever he pleased, as what he said when he was in a fit of passion was no more binding than if it had been said in a fit of drunkenness or delirium. Moreover I used the freedom to suggest to him that no sensible Man would schakle his free will with <hi rend="italic">vows</hi>; seeing that nature and fate already cast too many obstacles in the way of his wishes&#x2014; One might have expected that he would <supplied>[have]</supplied> felt some gratitude to me for taking all this trouble&#x2014; Instead of that, what do <pb id="pg-03-178" n="03:178"/>you think the little Viper did? He packed up all the scraps of my handwriting which he had in his possession, with a great quantity of other relics equally precious and sent them to me with the worst-bred letter I ever read in my life&#x2014; It is now all gone out of my head, except the concluding words&#x2014;&#x201C;When you want a friend and know not where to find one&#x2014;look towards me!&#x201D; Magnanimous Doctor! I think I shall be badly off indeed, when I turn my eyes in his direction&#x2014; Is this his last explosion, think you? He really hurts my nerves&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now I must leave off; for I have a great many parting visits to make; and my trunks to pack in the evening&#x2014; Tomorrow I go to Major Chrighton&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spelled Crichton&#x2019;s in <hi rend="italic">LL</hi> and identified by A.

<p>&#x201C;Paris?&#x201D; I hear you exclaim: &#x201C;Unhappy soul! what has taken <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> to Paris? Art thou frantic? Art thou dreaming? Or has the Hindoo Princess actually bewitched thee that thou <hi rend="italic">hast</hi> brought thy acid visage and most atrabiliar philosophy into this land of fops and pastry-cooks, where vanity and Sensuality have set up their chosen shrine, and every one that falls not down to worship them is as an alien and an interloper! What hast <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> to do with Paris?&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps an echo of Prince Hal&#x2019;s &#x201C;What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day?&#x201D; addressed to Falstaff, <hi rend="italic">I Henry IV</hi>, I, ii.</note> In truth, my Love, I <pb id="pg-03-179" n="03:179"/>have very little to do with it; yet here I am, and little less suprised than you are at my journey hither. The case, however, is not very marvellous after all. You must know, the daily sight of the French coast from Dover had awakened the travelling propensities of certain of our party; particularly of the little fidgetty, higgle-haggling, good-hearted, logic-chopping Mr Strachey and of the fair Princess whose name I must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> mention; between whom after infinite consultations a trip to vanity-fair was at length arranged; I by dint of multiplied solicitation and persuasions being as it were half forced to accompany them. Through delays and entanglements, thro&#x2019; perils by land and perils by water, we accordingly proceeded on our way; Strachey and I riding on the dickey of the Princess&#x2019; carriage, herself and maid within; Strachey scolding the postillions and inn keepe<supplied>[rs]</supplied> in French that would have made even Rhadamanthus laugh, the rest of us taking the matter with extreme equanimity, and all enjoying such raree-shew delights as an excursion of that kind affords. We arrived last saturday; and continue I suppose till some days after next. The confusion, the tumult, the hubbub of our situation words give a poor idea of: since the building of the Tower of Babel I do not think it has been equalled. But your thirtieth of October is arriving; and I would not let it pass without assuring you that here or yonder I am still thinking of you with the feelings which become us both; that my spirit flies joyfully away from this jingling chaos of frivolity to join in communion however interrupted with the spirit that is dear to it beyond all others. Is not this the chief and most precious purport of all our letters? That we love one another, and <hi rend="italic">will</hi> love one another thro&#x2019; all the changes and chances of our existence in time or after it? Blessed truth! Glorious certainty! The words or ideas by which it is conveyed are of small importance, when such a meaning is attached to them.</p>
<p>In the middle of such an uproar you are not to expect that I should tell you any thing worth telling of myself or the scene that is still so strange to me. Our journey, as you have seen, was planned upon a very humble princple, the hope of <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> with the bodily eye alone; and on this small scale I think it succeeds as well as could be expected. France has been so betravelled and beridden and betrodden by all manner of vulgar people that any romance connected with it is entirely gone off ten years ago; the idea of <hi rend="italic">studying</hi> it is for me at present altogether out of the question; so I quietly surrender myself to the direction of guide books and <foreign><hi rend="italic">laquais de place</hi></foreign> [local flunkeys], and stroll about from sight to sight, as if I were assisting at a huge <pb id="pg-03-180" n="03:180"/>Bartholomew fair;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Held at Smithfield, this fair was the only one still held within the City of London. It was kept up annually for three days from <date>3 Sept.</date> unless this was a Sunday. It was of ancient foundation, notably riotous, and of growing ill-repute. Animals and giants were favorite exhibits. See William Hone, <hi rend="italic">The Every-Day Book</hi> (<date when="1826">1826</date>), for a full account which ends: &#x201C;No person of respectability now visits it, but as a curious spectator of an annual congregation of ignorance and depravity.&#x201D;</note> only that the booths are the Palais Royal or the Boulevards, and the shews the Theatre Fran&#x26;ccedil;ais instead of Punch, and the Jardin des Plantes<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where the Paris Zoo was located.</note> instead of the Irish giant or Polito&#x2019;s menagerie. For a few days such a life is tolerable enough; in a month, I think it could not fail to kill me with utter tedium. Of my adventures and impressions I will talk to you for many days when we meet; nay you and I, you know, are to go and see all these curiosities in company: but for the present I must occupy my sheet with other matters. Suffice it to observe that I am moderately patient of the business, far more so than I anticipated; in rather better health than when I set out; and daily growing more and more contemptuous of Paris, and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">maniere d&#x2019;&#xEA;tre</hi></foreign> [way of life] of its people. Poor fellows! I feel alternately titillated into laughter and shocked to the verge of horror at the hand they make of life. Eating, everlasting eating from the hands of <foreign>patisseurs</foreign> [pastry-cooks], restaurateurs, <foreign>traiteurs</foreign> [restaurant-keepers] and cooks of every size and shape; with gambling ad infinitum, and looking glasses to the same extent seem to form the great staple of their enjoyments. They cannot live without artificial excitements, without <foreign><hi rend="italic">sensations agr&#xE9;ables</hi></foreign>. Their houses are not homes, but places where they sleep and dress; they live in <foreign><hi rend="italic">caf&#xE9;s</hi></foreign> and promenades and theatres; and ten thousand dice are set a-rattling every night in every quarter of their city. Every thing seems gilding and fillagree, addressed to the eye not the touch. Their shops and houses are like toy-boxes; every apartment is tricked out with mirrors and expanded into infinitude by their illusion. This parlour is about twenty-feet square; but glass and tinfoil spread it out into galleries like that of the Louvre; and not one but twenty score of men are writing to you. The people&#x2019;s character seems like their shops and faces; gilding and rouge without; hollowness and rottenness within. They are elegant, the pink of elegance; polite as ushers of the black rod;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., very polite. The Gentelmen Ushers of the Black Rod were the chief Gentlemen Ushers of the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s department of the royal household, ushers to the House of Lords, etc.</note> full of lofty talk about generosity and delicacy, yet openly addicted to the basest practices and most beastly vices. Oh the hateful contrast between physical perfection <pb id="pg-03-181" n="03:181"/>and moral nothingness! Between the extreme of luxury and the extreme of wretchedness unrelieved by hope or principle! Yesterday I walked along the <hi rend="italic">Pont Neuf</hi>; jugglers and quacks and cooks and barbers and dandies and gulls and sharpers were racketting away with a deafening hum at their manifold pursuits; I turned aside into a small mansion with the name of <hi rend="italic">Morgue</hi> upon it; there lay the naked body of an old grey-headed artisan whom misery had driven to drown himself in the river! His face wore the grim fixed scoul of despair; his lean horny hands with their long ragged nails were lying by his sides; his patched and soiled apparel with his apron and <hi rend="italic">sabots</hi> were hanging at his head; and there lay fixed in his iron slumber, heedless of the vain din that rolled around him on every side, was this poor outcast stretched in silence and darkness forever. I gazed upon the wretch for a quarter of an hour; I think I never felt more shocked in my life. To live in Paris for a fortnight is a treat; to live in it continually would be a martyrdom.</p>
<p>But no one at present threatens me with such a consummation: so let us leave Paris and Parisians till a fitter opportunity; and betake ourselves to something nearer home. By an accident which I now consider as most fortunate, I missed my passage to Calais by a minute and a half&#x2019;s delay; and&#x2014;got your letter! Before proceeding to Boulogne next day, I wrote an answer; but it was so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> wild that I durst not risk sending it, lest you should cut me forever and a day. So, you are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> jealous then? Provoking creature! already should Corruption like the worm have been feeding on your damask cheek;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;She never told her love, / But let concealment, like a worm i&#x2019; the bud, / Feed on her damask cheek&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night</hi>, II, iv).</note> if indeed you had not preferred making your quietus at once with a bare bodkin,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, i.</note> and leaving the Princess mistress of the field! It is clear enough that you care next to nothing for me, or something of this sort would have followed so alarming an announcement as my last. Will nothing move that flinty heart of yours? I swear I will have amends of you, if any can be had on Earth.&#x2014; Seriously, I do not think you have any reason to be very jealous. If you choose to alter in all the leading features of your character, I may cease to respect and try if I can cease to love you; but till then, the danger is not pressing. No, Jane! I have more skill in people than you think. I know you have some hundreds of faults; yet with the whole of them ten times told, thou art worth any twenty women in the world<supplied>[.]</supplied> Housewives and vanitarians, unnaturals and naturals, Saints and worldlings, or whatever else their species <pb id="pg-03-182" n="03:182"/>may be that have passed in review before me, have each their several merit and attraction; but a heart and a spirit like my own Jane&#x2019;s I have seen nowhere. Is that heart mine, my own? Oh what a paltry knave were I to mock its generous affection, and cast it from me as a worthless thing&#x2014;like the base Judean to throw a pearl away richer than all my tribe!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, V, ii. Carlyle wrote <hi rend="italic">Judean</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Indian</hi> in this quotation more than once. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250520-TC-ADBM-01">TC to ADBM, <date when="1825-05-20">20 May 1825</date></ref>.</note> No, <hi rend="italic">mein Kind</hi>, we were set apart by Destiny for each other; we have chosen one another; we are one, and nothing shall part us. Together, we may fail to be happy; separate, we can hardly fail to be miserable. Let us abide by one another, befal what may! If we are wise, the world may yet be a place of blessedness for both.</p>
<p>This journey to Paris has scattered all my projects to the winds; at least has interrupted not only their fulfilment, but even their planning. Something notable, however, I will do; and that shortly. If this pitiful book were off my hands; my fortune and circumstances shall be remodelled, or I may as well give up the cause entirely. Is it not hard for both of us? There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a genius in you, there is a genius in me; yet I feel as if it would never, never see the light at all, far less attain expansion and maturity, so many and so grievous are the obstacles that war against it! One, by far the most tremendous in my own case, the want of health, I am resolved, irrevocably resolved to conquer, if the means of conquering it can be accessible to man. I <hi rend="italic">will not</hi> sit any longer with this infernal nightmare paral<supplied>[y]</supplied>zing all my faculties of mind and heart; I will be free <supplied>[as]</supplied> other sons of A<supplied>[dam]</supplied> are, let the cost be what it may! It seems so easy too: a residence in the <supplied>[country]</supplied> with quietne<supplied>[ss and]</supplied> regularity, and fit succession of bodily and mental labour could not fail to set me quit of this quintessence of all curses. Do you know what I am thinking of, actually meditating as a scheme of life? I am meditating to engage with some literary Tradesman for a full translation of all Schillers works dramatic and philosophical to retire with the necessary apparatus into Annandale or any other dale; and there alternately writing and riding, reading and gardening and conversing with kind Christian souls, and living according to the strictest letter of the Birmingham code, to let poor old nature rally her forces and restore me to my pristine strength and serenity of heart and head, before attempting farther in the fight of life, which at present I wage with such tremendous odds. Now what do you think of this? Is it a wise plan or utterly foolish? Tell me, give me your advice; for the interest of one is that of both. What think you <pb id="pg-03-183" n="03:183"/>of it? Will you take a share in the concern, and become a philosophical recluse yourself? Will you? Would you? O Heavens! what a thing it might be, if it prospered! But I fancy you are laughing at me, wicked enemy that you are; and I have nothing for it but to hold my peace, and let you have your way. Write to me, however, largely and frankly: it were good for us to understand these matters more completely. What good is there in seclusion and reserve between <hi rend="italic">us</hi>? Write, my dearest, to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ihre B<supplied>[r]</supplied>iefe</hi>, errinnern Sie, sind <hi rend="italic">immer</hi> ganz meine eigene: ob die gegenwartige diess seyn f&#xfc;r Ihnen oder nicht, ist ungewiss; so muss ich mich enthalten</foreign>!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle translates the German as follows: &#x201C;Your Letters, remember, are <hi rend="italic">always</hi> for my own eye alone; whether this that I now write will be &#x2018;all for yourself&#x2019; or not, is uncertain; so I must be careful.&#x201D; Carlyle&#x2019;s first impressions, of Paris may be compared with his account, &#x201C;Excursion (futile enough) to Paris,&#x201D; of a trip taken in <date when="1851">1851</date>, published in <hi rend="italic">Last Words of Thomas Carlyle</hi> (London, <date when="1892">1892</date>), pp. 149&#x2013;91.</note> The Germans are correct in this.</p>
<p>But here are Strachey and Kitty (precious names as you observe!) returning from the Louvre; and I must be about my business. You will have a letter waiting for me at Liverpool Terrace, Dover? I shall be there in eight days, and shall be <hi rend="italic">dreadfully</hi> disappointed if I do not hear from you. Will you write directly? Tell me all your occupations, projects, wishes! Despise the little imp of a Doctorkin; banish the inane G&#xE4;el, or tolerate him if he will not banish; follow your purposes in spite of every difficulty. Trust in me to the end, as I trust in you! Fortune will shine o<supplied>[u]</supplied>t on us; we will <hi rend="italic">force</hi> her to shine, and we shall both be happy. <closer><salute>God keep you my Dearest! Farewell and love me!

<ps><p>Go on with your Schiller as rapidly as possible: I begin printing forthwith on my return.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>You are naturally surprised at my long silence, and you are like to be still more so when I tell you the reason of it. I have been in France, my boy! In the ancient city of Paris! I returned only yesterday; and thus the voice of your anxiety never reached my ear. My heart it did reach, however; and I twice began a letter to you from the <hi rend="italic">Grand H&#xF4;tel de Wagram</hi>, to tell you of my abode and my welfare; but the bustle of the modern Babylon, the chaotic tumult of my own situation in it, had put me into such a mystified condition that I felt myself unable to indite three lines of sense without a mighty effort, and so judged it better to give up the attempt entirely, and wait till I reached old England to inform you that I had ever left it. I fully expected a letter from you yesterday on my arrival: I was disappointed here; but your customary <foreign><hi rend="italic">ganz wohl</hi></foreign>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Postage for newspapers, etc., was cheaper than letter-post; so, when sending a copy of the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> to one another, the Carlyles used to write (inconspicuously because illegally) &#x201C;<foreign>ganz wohl</foreign>&#x201D; (all&#x2019;s well) on it. At times also they put strokes on the newspaper, and through agreed-upon code the number of strokes conveyed the message.</note> and your kind eagerness to hear of me were recorded duly in the last <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>. I lose not a single post in answering you; tho&#x2019; as yet considerably muddled; writing in an upper room of the <hi rend="italic">Shakespear hotel</hi>; and after <hi rend="italic">fourteen hours</hi> of sleep, still sleepy. You will excuse every thing.</p>
<p>My expedition to Paris was nearly as unexpected to myself as the news of it will be to you. Strachey, a little bustling, logic-chopping, good-hearted, frank fellow, came down to Dover three weeks ago; and finding himself, I suppose, rather dull in the region of the Cinque Ports, and tempted moreover by the persuasions of his cousin Kitty, as well as by the daily sight of the French coast, he determined at last on a journey thither; and after infinite pleadings and solicitations I was prevailed upon to be of the party. They were to travel in their own carriage; Kitty and her maid inside, Strachey on the coach-box to see the country; the additional expense for me would be nothing; it would be <hi rend="italic">so</hi> pleasant, and would do me <hi rend="italic">so</hi> much good. In fine after a world of perplexities, and miscalculations and misventures, I having first half consented, then wholly refused, then again consented, we at length all assembled by different routes on the sands of Boulogne-sur-mer <pb id="pg-03-185" n="03:185"/>in the afternoon of Thursday gone a fortnight, and set off with the utmost speed of three lean horses of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">poste royale</hi></foreign> for Paris. After adventures and mistakes, which will keep us laughing many a winter night, when thou and I meet, we reached the capital on Saturday about four o&#x2019;clock; and forthwith established ourselves in the <hi rend="italic">H&#xF4;tel de Wagram</hi>, and proceeded to the great purpose of our journey, the seeing of the many sights with which the metropolis of France abounds beyond any other spot on the surface of the earth. By degrees we got into a proper train, and every thing went on wonderfully well. Strachey and I went out, singly or in company, to purvey for dinners and breakfasts in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">caf&#xE9;s</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">restaurateur</hi></foreign> establishments, Miss Kirkpatrick generally boarding at home; and after wandering about all day at pleasure, a neat little <foreign><hi rend="italic">chambre &#xE0; coucher</hi></foreign> [bedroom] awaited me, where I lay down to sleep in spite of all noises, and awoke next morning ready to renew the work of discovery in some new quarter of the city. Sated at length with wonders, we left Paris last Wednesday; and after a not unprosperous journey, arrived here yesterday afternoon. Irving with his household had left Dover a few hours before; Mrs Stracheys house had no room for me; so I travelled a few paces over to the &#x201C;Shakespear&#x201D; and took possession of a little garret bed-room, fronting the western face of the Castle, and moderately quiet; where I am now writing to my good Jack, and where I purpose to continue for another night before setting out for London to begin a serious course of work after all this idle wandering to and fro, the enjoyments of which I have now pretty well exhausted. I have a standing invitation to the Stracheys&#x2019; table and house; but I am very well at my ease here, and want to have some time for thought and rest. To-day I shall dine with them; to-morrow I think of departing.</p>
<p>On the whole I cannot say that I regret this jaunt: I have seen many strange things, which may people my imagination with interesting forms, and perhaps yield some materials for reflexion and improvement. France as it presented itself to me, on a most cursory survey, seemed a place rather to be looked at than be tarried in; and in the former point of view I relished it considerably. Oh that I had space to paint to you the strange pilgarlock [<hi rend="italic">pilgarlic</hi>: peeled garlic, weak miserable-looking] figures that I saw breakfasting over a few expiring embers on roasted apples; ploughing with three ponies with ploughs like peat-barrows; or folded together in long trough-shaped wicker carts, wearing night-caps and dresses of blue calico, with a black stump of a pipe stuck between their jaws, and a drop hanging at their <pb id="pg-03-186" n="03:186"/>long thin noses, and faces puckered together into the most <hi rend="italic">weepy-mousie</hi> aspect! Or the women riding on cuddies with wooden saddles; or the postillions with their leather shovel hats, and their boots like moderate churns; often blind of an eye, or broken-legged, and always the coolest liars in existence! But better than all was our own mode of treating them, and Strachey&#x2019;s French when he scolded the waiters and hosts of the inns &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">C&#x2019;est bien imposante</hi></foreign> [<foreign><hi rend="italic">imposante</hi></foreign> underscored twice]!&#x201D; said he at Beauvais; &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">c&#x2019;est une&#x2014;une&#x2014;rascalitie</hi></foreign> [<foreign><hi rend="italic">rascalitie</hi></foreign> underscored twice]&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">vous dis-je; vous avez charg&#xE9;</hi></foreign> [<foreign><hi rend="italic">charg&#xE9;</hi></foreign> underscored twice] <foreign><hi rend="italic">deux fois trop! vous etes</hi></foreign> &#x26;c&#x201D;; to all of which they answered with the gravity of judges passing sentence of death: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Monsieur, c&#x2019;est impossible; on ne vous surfait nullement; on ne</hi> &#x26;c. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">O&#xf9; est</hi></foreign> [<foreign><hi rend="italic">est</hi></foreign> underscored twice] <foreign><hi rend="italic">les chevaux?</hi></foreign>&#x201D; shrieked he at the end of every post: <foreign><hi rend="italic">vont venir, Monsieur</hi></foreign>, said they; Kitty and I were like to split with laughing. At length Strachey himself gave up the cause entirely and took to speaking French-English without disguise. When a man asked him for <foreign><hi rend="italic">quelque chose &#xE0; boire; je vous ai conduit tr&#xE8;s bien</hi></foreign>; Strachey answered without looking at him &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Nong! vous avez driv&#xE9; devilish slow</hi></foreign>&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The dialogue in garbled French, with Strachey&#x2019;s ridiculous errors, is not glossed since it would lose most of its point if it were.</note> which suited quite as well.&#x2014; Of Paris I shall say nothing till we meet. It is the Vanity-fair of the universe, and cannot be described in <hi rend="italic">many</hi> letters. As a city its aspect resembles that of Edinburgh; high houses of white stone, with immense stacks of chimneys occupying nearly all the gable; and projections with perpendicular windows in the roof. With very few exceptions the streets are narrow and crowded and unclean; the kennel in the middle, and a lamp hanging over it here and there, on a rope from side to side. There are no foot-paths; but an everlasting press of carriages and carts, and dirty people hastening to and fro among them, amid a thousand <foreign><hi rend="italic">gare-gares</hi></foreign>! [look out&#x2014;look out!] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">sacr&#xE9;s</hi></foreign> [damns] and other oaths and admonitions; while by the side are men roasting ches<supplied>[t]</supplied>nuts in their booths; fruit-shops, wine-shops, barbers, silkmerchants selling <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; Prix juste</hi></foreign> (without cheating), <foreign><hi rend="italic">restaurateurs, caf&#xE9;s, traiteurs</hi></foreign> [restaurant keepers], <foreign><hi rend="italic">magazins de bon-bons</hi></foreign> [sweet shops], billiard tables, <foreign><hi rend="italic">estaminets</hi></foreign> (gin-shops) <foreign><hi rend="italic">d&#xE9;bits de tabac</hi></foreign> (where you buy a cigar for a half-penny, and go out smoking it), and every species of <foreign><hi rend="italic">d&#xE9;p&#xF4;t</hi></foreign> [storeroom] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">entrep&#xF4;t</hi></foreign> [warehouse] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">magazin</hi></foreign> [shop] for the comfort and refreshment of the physical part of the natural man; plying its vocation in the midst of noise and stink, both of which it augments by its produce <pb id="pg-03-187" n="03:187"/>and its efforts to dispose of it. The <hi rend="italic">Palais Royal</hi> is a spot unrivalled in the world; the chosen abode of vanity and vice; the true palace of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">tigre-singes</hi></foreign> (tiger-apes) as Voltaire called his countrymen; a place which I rejoice to think is separated from me by the girdle of the ocean, and never likely to be copied in the British isles. I dined in it often; and bought four little bone <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE9;tuis</hi></foreign> (needle-cases) at a frank (9&#xBD;<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) each for our four sisters at Mainhill. It is a sort of emblem of the French character; the perfection of the physical and fantastical part of our nature, with an absence of all that is solid and substantial in the moral and often in the intellectual part of it. Looking-glasses and trinkets and fricass&#xE9;es and gaming-tables seem to be the life of a Frenchman; his home is a place where he sleeps and dresses; he <hi rend="italic">lives</hi> in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">salon du restaurateur</hi></foreign>, on the <hi rend="italic">boulevards</hi> or the garden of the <hi rend="italic">Palais royal</hi>. Every room you enter, destitute of carpet or fire, is expanded into boundlessness by mirrors; and I should think about fifty thousand dice-boxes are set a rattling every night (especially on Sundays) within the walls of Paris. There the people sit and chatter, and fiddle away existence as if it were all a raree-shew; careless how it go, so they have excitement, <foreign><hi rend="italic">des sensations agr&#xE9;ables</hi></foreign>. Their palaces and picture-galleries and triumphal arches are the wonder of the Earth; but the stink of their streets is considerable, and you cannot walk on them without risking the fracture of your legs of <supplied>[or]</supplied> neck.</p>
<p>But peace be to the French! For here I have no room to express even my ideas ab<supplied>[out them,]</supplied> far less to do them any justice. Suffice it to observe, that I contrived to see nearly all <supplied>[that]</supplied> could be seen within 12 days, and to carry off as much enjoyment as it was possible for sights to afford me, at the expence of about five pounds sterling. I saw the Louvre gallery of pictures, the Tuileries palace, the <hi rend="italic">Jardin des plantes</hi>, the churches, and cemeteries and all that <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be seen. I saw Talma<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Joseph Talma (<date when="1763">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826">1826</date>), French tragic actor, a favorite of Napoleon.</note> the actor, and almost touched his most Christian Majesty Charles X. What was more interesting still, I heard the Baron Cuvier<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Georges Cuvier (<date when="1769">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832">1832</date>), famous as founder of the science of comparative anatomy and a historian of science.</note> deliver his introductory lecture, on comparative anatomy, and contrived to pick up some not altogether useless information about the study of medicine in Paris. I find it will not be unattainable for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to go thither, nor unadvisable, if all things prosper when you have done with Edinburgh. There are about a hundred and fifty students from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; Dublin there at <supplied>[pr]</supplied>esent; the expense <hi rend="italic">need</hi> not be much <pb id="pg-03-188" n="03:188"/>greater than in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and you have dissection <hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi> for the general purposes of anatomy; three large hospitals, where every patient that dies is opened for the purposes of <foreign><hi rend="italic">anatomie pathologique</hi></foreign> (a science, I understand, almost peculiar to France); and lectures and books of the best description, to any extent, <hi rend="italic">gratis</hi>. Cuvier&#x2019;s students could not be very rich; many of them had a <foreign><hi rend="italic">hallanshaker</hi></foreign> [beggar] look, worse than Barclays.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18140430-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1814-04-30">30 April 1814</date></ref>.</note> Cuvier himself pleased me much: he seems about fifty; with a fair head of hair, growing grey; a large, broad, not very high head; a nose irregularly acquiline, receding mouth, peaked chin, blue eyes which he casts upwards puckering the eyebrows with a look of great sweetness and wisdom; altogether the appearance of an accomplished kind and gentlemanly person. His lecture lasted an hour and a half: I made out nine tenths of it, and thought it very good, and wonderfully fluent and correct for an extempore one.&#x2014; Nay what do you think, I made bold to introduce myself to Legendre,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adrien Marie Legendre (<date when="1752">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833">?1833</date>), French mathematician, whose <hi rend="italic">Elements of Geometry and Trigonometry</hi> Carlyle had translated.</note> and was by him taken to a sitting of the Institute, and presented to <hi rend="italic">Dupin</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the three famous brothers, probably Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Pierre Charles Dupin (<date when="1784">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873">1873</date>) since he wrote several treatises on mathematics and economics and was more likely to be in such a group than his brothers. He also published books on his travels, which had included England, Scotland, and Ireland.</note> the celebrated traveller in England, who charged me with a packet of letters for Constable of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Here also I saw Laplace and Lacroix and Poisson the mathematicians,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marquis Pierre Simon de Laplace (<date when="1749">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827">1827</date>); Sylvestre Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Lacroix (<date when="1765">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843">1843</date>); Sim&#xE9;on Denis Poisson (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840">1840</date>).</note> and Vauquelin and Chaptal and Th&#xE9;nard the chemists,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (<date when="1763">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829">1829</date>); Jean Antoine Chaptal, Comte de Chanteloup (<date when="1756">1756</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832">1832</date>); Baron Louis Jacques Th&#xE9;nard (<date when="1777">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857">1857</date>).</note> and heard Magendie<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Magendi&#xE9; (<date when="1783">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855">1855</date>), French physiologist.</note> read a paper on the fifth pair of nerves. Dupin was exceedingly polite, and would have introduced me to Laplace and others; an honour which I declined, desiring only to impress myself with the picture of their several appearances, all which I promise to give you orally when we see each other face to face<supplied>[.]</supplied> For the present, however, you see I must begone. Write to me the first instant after you have read this. Direct to Irving&#x2019;s 4. Middleton Terrace. I got your Birmingham letter early, and having written twice since then, I expected another ere now. You will not keep me longer waiting. If you be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, Alick will write; he owes me a letter immediately. From Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I expect news the moment you are settled. I have a million of things to say, but not a point of room <pb id="pg-03-189" n="03:189"/>to say them. Give my constant and warmest affection to our father and mother, and be sure you tell me how my mothers health continues. Alick was right to buy a larger pony: it seems probable enough that I may use it yet. Have you lent it to Waugh? I think you should. I have a notion of coming to establish myself, with work &#x26;c, in Scotland after all. My health will improve with care: at present, in spite of all irregularities, it is not worse. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my dear Jack! My love to all about Mainhill!

<salute>Dearest Friend</salute>
<p>Your letter was handed to me three days ago by&#x2014;my Mother. The one you burned must have been wild indeed; for even this was wild enough to have played the deuce with the Commonwealth, had not Providence graciously interfered in our behalf. While I was racking my wits for a pretext to keep it to myself, a carriage came to the door to take us to Corstorphine, and it was nothing very remarkable, that, in the bustle of setting out, I should have left the letter behind me; or rather should have forgot that I put it into my pocket.</p>
<p>So you have been in France, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Thomas! in France without me&#x2014;in the train of that everlasting Princess! How fortunate she is to have a carriage with a dickey!&#x2014; Well, I am flattering myself that your <hi rend="italic">residence on the Continent</hi> will have made you a bit of a Dandy. At least you will not speak Annandale, surely, after having <hi rend="italic">travelled</hi>&#x2014;Apollo and the Nine Muses forbid! It would be so delightful, when I go south, to find you about a hundredth part as &#x2018;elegant&#x2019; as my amiable Cousin!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Captain James Baillie, Miss Welsh&#x2019;s foolish and extravagant cousin far-removed, who dissipated his little fortune in silly ostentation and gambling in stocks, and in his later years received a pension, anonymously sent by Carlyle through an agent&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> I am quite sure that I should fall in love with you if you <pb id="pg-03-190" n="03:190"/>were, and then&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh Heavens what a thing it might be <hi rend="italic">if it prospered</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;surely you will own no man had ever such inducement to study the Graces&#x2014;</p>
<p>What do you think, the Orator <hi rend="italic">has</hi> invited me! I was surprised, indeed terrified at sight of a letter from him, the day before I left Dumfriesshire. My imagination instantly decided that nothing but your illness or something as urgent could have induced him to com<supplied>[m]</supplied>it letter-writing; and I broke the seal and read &#x201C;My Well-beloved Friend &#x26; Pupil&#x201D; in the utmost trepidation. But I drew breath again, when glancing over the first paragraph I found merely an assurance of his affection, &#x201C;such affection as by the laws of God and Man he could feel for <hi rend="italic">a second woman</hi>&#x201D;: And when I came to &#x201C;But there is no use in saying more of an affection which shall be shown by <hi rend="italic">deeds</hi> not words&#x201D;&#x2014;with a note of admiration after it&#x2014;my expectations were raised to the highest pitch, and I thought that, at the very least, he was about to send Washington Irving down to Scotland to pay his addresses to me&#x2014; No such thing. The object of his letter was to present me with &#x2018;the joint invitation&#x2019; of himself and his Wife, &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">if</hi>&#x2019; I came to England to spend what time I could spare with them in London,&#x2014;coupled with an apology for the bad accommodation I should find, which showed that my visit would be monstrously inconvenient&#x2014; On the whole the letter was a kind one; but evidently written under <hi rend="italic">female influence</hi>.&#x2014; Of you he says &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle is here, and we live together in the same fellowship as formerly&#x2014; I esteeming him as one of the most sincere and certainly the most ideal <hi rend="italic">one</hi> I have yet met, and he esteeming me as not unworthy of his regard, and one that will <hi rend="italic">help him to the uttermost</hi> in his passage thro&#x2019; life&#x2014; But we have many squab<supplied>[b]</supplied>les on that matter of writing letters&#x201D;!!! He has probably told you that I declined his invitation <hi rend="italic">for the present</hi>. Indeed it was not in my option to do otherwise; for it was only conditional,&#x2014;if I came to England,&#x2014;and there is no chance of going to England for some months yet&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baillie&#x2019;s last letter to me was quite as full of uncertainties as the former one. The obstacle to his marriage is that his Intended, who is a young Widow, forfeits a handsome income if she marries again. My Cousin is not in the least avaricious, and would very willingly take her without a fortune; Only she is so immensely grand! she must have a fine house, a fine equipage, every thing fine about and he has no more than a thousand a year! what an affliction. In short they can neither make up their minds to live without her jointure nor without each other; and how they will settle it at last, Heaven only <pb id="pg-03-191" n="03:191"/>knows&#x2014; This <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know if they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> married I will move Heaven and Earth that I may go to them,&#x2014;for three reasons, because I am sick of my present way of life, because I love my elegant Cousin, and because I wish to be near <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. What a will o&#x2019; the wisp this London business has been to me! But no matter! <foreign>le bon temps viendra</foreign> [the good time will come],&#x2014;at least I hope so&#x2014;</p>
<p>Enough of my own affairs&#x2014; Let us turn to yours&#x2014;what do I think of your new project? At first I cordially disapproved it altogether. The translating of all Schiller&#x2019;s works seemed a stupendous and ungrateful task, which would heavily occupy your time and talents for years; and be attended with no advantage to you, except putting some hundreds of pounds in your pocket: the other part of the plan filled me with horror, and on deliberation, I am still decidedly against it. What fellowship is there in Annandale for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>? Doubtless you might find &#x2018;kind Christian souls&#x2019; there to love you and wonder at you, but without spirits like your own to <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> you,&#x2014;without sympathy your life would be without a soul&#x2014; Oh mercy never think of establishing yourself in Annandale! All your faults are the effects of your isolated way of life: if you seclude yourself altogether from your fellows, as sure as fate, you will sink in a year or two, into the most surly, misanthropic, self-opinionative, dreadfully disagreeable person alive. It was only the other day, you wrote to me that you began to think there were many more worthy people in the world than you counted on; and already are you projecting to turn your back on them? You will never be so mad! Certainly the recovery of your health <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be attended to above all things else; and if that is not to be brought about in the smoke and bustle of a City, why then, you must seek it in the quietness and pure air of the country: But what is to hinder you setting yourself down within a mile or two of London&#x2014;in some pleasant place where you might ride and garden just as in Annandale; and, at the same time, occasionally enjoy society which would refresh and incite your spirit? My plan perhaps is foolish: yours is certainly not wise.</p>
<p>As to the translating of Schiller, there is much to be said for and against. It would employ without fatiguing your mind; it would increase your command of language, and make composition more easy to you; it would insure you a certain and sufficient income, and deliver you from anxieties about what you are to do, and how you are to live. On the other hand, you are likely to be disgusted with the undertaking before you finish it; there is no exercise for your finest faculties in <pb id="pg-03-192" n="03:192"/>turning sentences and choosing words; there is no scope for your genius in transcribing the thoughts and sentiments of another; on the contrary I should be afraid that in imitating so long you might cease to be original, and lastly the task when done,&#x2014;however well done will gain you only the praise of a good Translator. If any of your new Friends would &#x2018;help you to the uttermost&#x2019; and find you a sinecure which would set you free from care about the morrow, I would like better that you would follow out your plan of the &#x2018;Lives&#x2019; (which is certainly the grandest you have yet thought of) tho&#x2019; by fits and starts as you felt ab<supplied>[le]</supplied> for it. But it is only Blockheads who get sinecures; as it is, this trans<supplied>[lation]</supplied> perhaps is the very best thing you could engage in. The only advice I can gi<supplied>[ve]</supplied> you is to do nothing in haste for fear that you repent at leisure. It is rea<supplied>[lly]</supplied> a high farce my giving advice to any one and of all people on earth to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>; bu<supplied>[t]</supplied> recollect you bade me.&#x2014; <foreign>Grace a dieu</foreign> [Thank God!] my wanderings for this season ar<supplied>[e]</supplied> nearly at an end. We return to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Saturday and home the end of the next week, accompanied by Miss Gilchrist.

I wish he was at the bottom of the Murray Firth&#x2014; My present sojourn is the most distressing that you can imagine: the weather is so bad that one cannot cross the threshold; there is not a book in the hou<supplied>[se]</supplied> besides &#x2018;Rutledge&#x2019;s sermons&#x2019; and &#x2018;Black&#x2019;s sermons&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Rutledge, <hi rend="italic">Practical Sermons on Select Passages of Scripture</hi> (London, <date when="1794">1794</date>); and David Black, <hi rend="italic">Sermons on Death</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1806">1806</date>) or <hi rend="italic">Sermons on Important Subjects</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1808">1808</date>).</note> neither of which I have any relish for, and the &#x2018;Juvenile Library&#x2019; which, with the exception of &#x2018;Jack the Gi<supplied>[ant]</supplied> killer&#x2019; <supplied>[&#x2018;]</supplied>Blue Beard&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Wishing cap&#x2019; that I read last night, does not appear to be particularly edifying; and then I have no Genius for needle <supplied>[work,]</supplied> so that I am delivered up without defence to the squealing of &#x2018;Him&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Still another &#x201C;baby brat,&#x201D; like the &#x201C;him&#x201D; of the Irvings.</note> the romping and wrangling of the larger children and the everlasting merriment of <supplied>[their hoydenish Highland Mother.

I have been idle six months to please my mother; I will now be diligent six months to please myself.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I promised to send you some account of my proceedings the moment I was settled; and I now hasten to fulfil my engagement. You must have already received my Dover letter, with the narrative of my French journey; so that the present sheet will be expected. I have another reason for speed in writing; the desire, the pressing anxiety I feel to hear from you. I know well you are not in proper health, tho&#x2019; your care for my comfort prompts you to conceal it from me, and often I daresay almost from yourself. Many, many are the anxious thoughts and prayers I send towards you, across the hills and rivers and long miles that divide us: let me trust that they are not all unheeded by Him who regardeth the cry of his children, and to whom the wishes of pure affection must be acceptable beyond all other wishes! One blessing, in the midst of many crosses, we have still to rejoice in: tho&#x2019; not so happy or so healthy as we could desire, we are still <hi rend="italic">here</hi> in the land of the living to console and love each other. Death has mowed down many millions since we first knew each other; yet we are still spared; and while either of us lives, never never can the other want a heart to trust in. Let us be thankful for what we have; and hope that yet in spite of every thing we shall live to see much good beneath the sun. The blessings I pray for to you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> in part be realized; and already in the breathing of them forth they bless myself: my love to my mother is enshrined in the holiest place of my soul; the darkest clouds of suffering, which obscure or obliterate other feelings, only render this more bright and moving. But for you, I should often have felt myself almost utterly forsaken.</p>
<p>These things I have often told you; but I feel them so often, and <pb id="pg-03-194" n="03:194"/>it does me good to speak of them. For the present I must take to humbler matters. I told the good Jack, at Dover, that I meant to make all speed to London, and there establish myself in the most convenient manner, and forthwith betake myself to some more profitable course of life than I had long been following. I have in fact been wandering far too long; but on tuesday night, my wanderings at least for a few months, I trust, came to an end. The Stracheys took me with them in their carriage to Shooter&#x2019;s Hill, and I made my way to the hospitable mansion of the Orator at Pentonville by various coaches as I best could. Next morning, no entreaties for delay could detain me: I set out in quest of lodgings, determined to take no rest till I had found some place which I could call my own, where I might at last collect my scattered thoughts, and see what yet remained to me to be accomplished or avoided. I found the task of taking lodgings considerably less abominable than I used to reckon it in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; Irving and his wife went with me to one or two, till I <hi rend="italic">got into the way</hi>; after which I dismissed them and proceeded in the search myself. Ere long I landed in Southampton-street, a fine clean quiet spot; and found a landlady and a couple of rooms almost exactly such as I was wanting. The rent 16 / per week, which is even cheap for London, was a less matter with me than the comforts of the place, which were certainly such as I never hoped to realize in London. The landlady is a middle-aged cleanly, substantial, most discreet looking person; she has a tidy girl for a servant, and one old asthmatical damsel who lodges with her on the ground floor, for her sole inmates. I occupy the whole second floor, with my bedroom and parlour, and above me, there is nothing but two empty rooms, neither of which is likely in my time to be occupied. I have now tried the place for two nights, and find it altogether excellent: if it hold on as it has begun, I shall reckon myself fortunate indeed that I have fallen in with it. She, the good landlady, cooks me my morsel of victuals in a style of truly English neatness, making me a little dinner too, which is not usual in lodgings, and so saving me the discomfort of hunting in chop-houses for a single mutton cutlet, and three potatoes, which is all that Badams allows me. The room which is of moderately large dimensions with two windows looks out upon a little empty space, neatly paved with clean tiles, the<supplied>[n]</supplied> a green wooden railing, then the flag-stones, then a new smart street, travelled by few itself, but communicating at the distance of a few scores of yards with the New Road, one of the greatest thoroughfares in London. The bedroom looks out upon green plots (one of which <pb id="pg-03-195" n="03:195"/>belongs to the house), then a field cut with walks, and beyond this a neat building which I believe is some public charity, and beside it among other houses the chapel of St. James&#x2019; Clerkenwell, which affords me the service of a town-clock. Both rooms are about the neatest I ever inhabited; papered and cleaned like bandboxes, and quieter than I supposed any were in this monstrous place. The people go to bed early; after half past ten, there is scarce a murmur to be heard till towards seven in the morning; and throughout all the day there is nothing that even approaches to noise. I give you all these details; because I know they will gratify you; the minutest circumstance that affects my comfort has an interest for my kind-hearted Mother.</p>
<p>Here then I have fixed my abode for a space; and design to set seriously about remoulding my affairs. On the whole I am happy that I have got into a house of my own, where I am sole lord and master, and can manage as I list without giving an account to any one. This I have found to be an essential requisite; the everlasting explanations and apologies and disappointments that attend a <hi rend="italic">dietetic</hi> among strangers, however well disposed to him, are to me a continual annoyance. Ever since leaving Birmingham, I have found it impossible even to adhere to my regulated system of diet, much less to accomplish aught in the way of study. Irving could not take me to board in his house, having engaged to admit one Parker from Glasgow (at a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> high rate) who is coming here to study law: indeed after inspecting the state of his internal economy I more than ceased to desire it. He himself is of rough-and-ready habits, and his wife is not by any means the pink of housekeepers: for one like me their house and table would have suited but indifferently in point of health, and their visitors and other interruptions would have sadly interfered with my standing business. Irving&#x2019;s kind and interesting conversation was the only thing that tempted me; and even this for the present could not have been got. The good Orator&#x2019;s whole heart and soul seem for a while to have been set on two solitary objects; the Caledonian Church, and a squealing brat of a child which his &#x201C;dear Isabella&#x201D; brought him some three months ago. This smallest and <foreign><hi rend="italic">wershest</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Weakest, most insipid.</note> of his Majesty&#x2019;s subjects the worthy preacher dandles and fondles and dry-nurses and talks about in a way that is piteous to behold. He speculates on the progressive development of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> senses, on the state of his bowels, on his hours of rest, his pap-spoons and his <foreign><hi rend="italic">hippings</hi></foreign> [diapers]; he asks you twenty times a-day (me he dare not ask any <pb id="pg-03-196" n="03:196"/>longer) if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is not a pretty boy; he even at times attempts a hideous chaunt to the creature by way of lullaby. Unhappy <foreign><hi rend="italic">gorb</hi></foreign> [newly hatched bird]! I have wished it farther than I need repeat at present: its mewing used to awaken me at night, its history kept me silent by day. Now that I am gone from its sphere, I can wish it well, as the offspring of my friend, whom after all I like not much the worse that he is overfond and foolish as a father. In my present state, too, I can enjoy all that is enjoyable of his company and friendships<supplied>[:]</supplied> this house is within three minutes walk of his, where I design to be a frequent visitor. They have been kind friends to me, I were a worthless creature to forget them.</p>
<p>Thus, my dear Mother, have I endeavoured to paint to you my present situation. What I mean to do in it is known to you already. This book of mine must be printed and of course made ready for printing: till that is effected, I am fixed in London. I am just now gathering all my things around me, getting books and shoes and clothes and every thing put in order; with the intent of commencing strenuously and prudently in the great work of writing and doctoring. I expect it will not be less <supplied>[than &#x2026;]</supplied> months before the printing is done; in the meanwhile I can keep looking about me, if anything eligible occur; if my health will be kind enough to improve, I should like to stay here for a longer period; but if it will not, then also I know what to do. I will come and set up house with you in Scotland: I will have work to write, a little garden to cultivate, a horse to ride upon, and all the kind souls of Mainhill to love. I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> have my health again, cost what it may! And what is more, I believe I <hi rend="italic">can</hi>.&#x2014; Meanwhile I expect to pass my time neither unpleasantly nor unprofitably in the city. I have people enough here, whom I wish to see and may see; some of them are attractive by their talents or knowledge, several by their kindness. The Stracheys I have found to be friendly in a high degree; Mrs Montague (Irving&#x2019;s &#x201C;noble lady,&#x201D; whom I do not like so well as Mrs S.) had a note lying for me at Dover, inviting me in very warm and high-flown terms to come and live with them. The Buller&#x2019;s are here at present; they sent inviting me by Arthur their son to come and dine with them to-day; I would not <hi rend="italic">dine</hi> with the King, but I engaged to go and take tea. Badams, whom I hope to see in a day or two, predicts that I will come back to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>; but this I do not expect. I must try to regulate myself by my own strength, or it will never do.</p>
<p>Now, my good Mother, lose not a moments time in answering this long-winded letter. I know you cannot get time to write <hi rend="italic">much</hi> yourself; but you can send a line or two, and the bold Alick, my old and <pb id="pg-03-197" n="03:197"/>faithful correspondent, will do the rest. Let me know about your health and proceedings in the first and chief place; then about all the movements that have taken place in your oeconomy, the small as well as the great, there is nothing that will not interest me. This is the fourth letter that I have written since I received any! Let Jack (for I suppose him in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> ere this) be told of my address, and of my instant need to hear from him. You might send the newspaper round by Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, if he cares aught for it: to me, the <foreign><hi rend="italic">ganz wohl</hi></foreign> is its most important information. How does my Father get along? He is now a letter in my debt; tell him in his own words that he cannot pay me a minute too soon. I trust his wonted good health is continued to him, and that he feels contented, active, and moderately comfortable. Is he saying aught of farms this year? I really do wish you had some more snug and sheltered spot than Mainhill: it would be the greatest pleasure for me to contribute all my little stock of cash to this purpose, and to come and live along with you, if all things suited. Bid Alick or my Father tell me all they know or think of this affair; I feel concerned in it.&#x2014; How are Mag and Mary and all the rest, and do they ever recollect me? Poor things! I know they do, and love me with the love of true and warm-hearted sisters. Tell them to get needles ready: I will send their needle-cases to them by the first conveyance. They are not cases worth a rush; but being French, and brought by <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, I know they will be prized.&#x2014; But the day is up, and shining, with a lustre more agreeable, that yesterday was like a deluge: I must out and walk and&#x2014;buy a hat! Now, my dear Mother, will you see and make them write to me, without the loss of a day? Tell me any thing, all things; the news from Dumfries, the news of your own neighbourhood, above all, the news of yourself and household. Be minute and speedy! Give my heart&#x2019;s love to every one at home, including Jean and Jenny, and the austere but faithful <hi rend="italic">Maistar Cairlill</hi>!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His youngest brother, James.</note> May all good be with every one of you, here and here after! <closer><salute>I am ever, My dear Mother&#x2019;s boy</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>What has happened, that you do not write? Is it possible that that French letter can have missed you? I am sure I carried it myself to the Rue Jean Jacques Rousseau, and transacted for it with a greasy prig of a clerk to the uttermost sou; trusting to no <foreign><hi rend="italic">Suisse</hi></foreign> [porter] or <foreign><hi rend="italic">Concierge</hi></foreign> [door-keeper] or <foreign><hi rend="italic">lacquais de place</hi></foreign> [local flunkey], that I might be sure of quieting your anxieties and in due time of having my own quieted. Alas! no letter waited for me at Dover; nothing but one poor dole of insipidity from a &#x201C;friend&#x201D; in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and another of affected sentimentality from the &#x201C;noble Mrs Montague&#x201D; at London; not a line from Dumfriesshire, not a line from Jane! Has aught happened&#x2014;to me or to you? I cannot say that I am absolutely miserable on this account; but a letter from you would be particularly precious at this very time. I make no grain of doubt but you will send it, the moment this arrives: you are very good; and these letters of ours are as it were the food of hope; among the most valuable blessings of life to both of us. Are they not? Then let us become better correspondents, kinder and more frequent, every day!</p>
<p>For myself I engage to improve mightily at no distant date. And much need I have; for throughout the last four months, I can scarcely recollect of writing to you one page of good sense, or any tolerable picture even of my own perceptions of it. I have been so hurried to and fro, so tossed about in never-ceasing vicissitude of all kinds, that I have scarcely known my right hand from my left; and for thinking, it has been impossible as flying. Strange destiny! That one, master of his own movements, and to whom repose and regularity are the essence of existence should have been so whirled from capital to capital, and land to land, as I have been of late. At last, however, thank Heaven! it is over: after all these wanderings, I am seated in this quiet <pb id="pg-03-199" n="03:199"/>airy street, in my own trim and comfortable apartments, by a hearth of which I am sole lord and master; at liberty to live according to the dictates of my own will, which I may guide in part by those of reason, if I happen to possess any reason. To-morrow I commence a meditated plan of life and labour: I will study and write, and try if I can gather any touch of health and wisdom; and to you I will send a thousand thoughts and warmest wishes daily, and long letters every week; letters as from <hi rend="italic">your</hi> friend, your brother, one who loves you more than fifty thousand brothers,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, V, i, Hamlet loves more than &#x201C;forty thousand&#x201D; brothers.</note> and regards your love as the jewel of his life. What a thing for me to be your guardian and counsellor and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Herzensfreund</hi></foreign> [intimate friend], selected from all others, honoured before all! Shall I <hi rend="italic">never</hi> be more worthy of the honour? Oh! that I were worthy of it! I should be the best and happiest man beneath the Sun. But patience! patience! Better times will come.</p>
<p>On reaching London, after my French excursion, I tarried but one night in the Orators, and proceeded next morning to establish myself in Lodgings. Lodgings I selected as the most eligible; tho&#x2019; the noble Mrs Montague and various other noble persons solicited the &#x201C;pleasure of accommodating&#x201D; my most sick person and contentious spirit. The people <hi rend="italic">have</hi> a touch of kindness in them; and do what I will, they persist in reckoning me a kind of genius, and the glory of protecting and consoling an afflicted genius all the world knows and covets. Genius, forsooth! a most notable genius! It is very good in these people; but really their protection is a trouble to me. For their kind feelings, God knows I thank them from the bottom of my heart; but farther it is not suitable at present. Here in my own quarters I am free as air, and except society have all I want: I am lonely, but I mean also to be busy; and as old Quixote said, and I have often said after him, &#x201C;If it were but a crust of bread and a cup of water that Heaven had given thee, rejoice that thou hadst none but Heaven to thank for it!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> (Part I, chap. 11): &#x201C;I had rather munch a crust of brown bread and an onion in a corner, without ado or ceremony, than feed upon a turkey at another man&#x2019;s table, where I am forced to chew slowly, drink little, wipe my mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough, or do other things that are the privileges of liberty and solitude.&#x201D;</note> A man that is not standing on his own feet in regard to economical affairs, soon ceases to be a man at all. Poor Coleridge is like the hulk of a huge ship; his mast and sails and rudder have rotted quite away. &#x2014; Once, while in Birmingham, I thought of boarding with the Orator, and actually proposed some scheme of that sort: I now heartily rejoice <pb id="pg-03-200" n="03:200"/>that we never came to terms. The presence of <hi rend="italic">Him</hi> seems to have overset the Orator&#x2019;s household and and [sic] his mind too: his &#x201C;dear Isabella&#x201D; is engaged in nursing it, let the house go how it will; and Irving&#x2019;s talk and thoughts return with a resistless biass to the same charming topic, start from where they please. Visit him at any time, you find him dry-nursing his off-spring; speak to him, he directs your attention to the form of its nose, the manner of its waking and sleeping and feeding and digesting; he dandles it fondly and gracefully as a she-bear does her cub; he asks you twice a minute (if he dare ask) whether it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> not a pretty boy; sometimes he attempts a hideous chaunt to it by way of lullaby. But what is best of all, he maintains that this is exercising generosity, and forgetting self! I advised him to send for Mr Horsnail&#x2019;s babe, a bigger and a heavier one than his, and nurse it: but he refused to be <hi rend="italic">so</hi> generous. Good Irving! I prize his friendship, and his conversation on any subject but <hi rend="italic">Him</hi>, which is one I have long since utterly cut: but for living with him, I am glad that his circumstances and mine forbade me to make trial of it.</p>
<p>Since I settled here, for the last three days, I have done nothing but meditate in solemn solitude on the state of my affairs. That I am one of the most pitiful and miserable of the sons of Adam is a fact with which I was long ago familiar: how to help the evil, to grow less pitiful and miserable is the question I am now debating. True I am sick, forever sick, and isolated from the world, and cannot for a thousand paltry hindrances get any part of my small fraction of a mind exerted or developed: but what of that? Life with all its difficulties, Mr C., and this very sickness the crowning curse of all, is the problem given you to solve; the chaos out of which your understanding (if any) is to bring out order and happiness and beauty: you are now free, Mr C., unfettered in your movements; help yourself; accomplish this solution; regulate this chaos; or go down to the Devil, and break some hearts that are dearer to you than existence&#x2014;whichever you prefer.&#x2014; Such is the order of the day: I am summoning every particle of strength within me to fulfil it. I have got all my implements and necessaries arranged, or in the way of being so; and to-morrow morning I begin to live by rule! I mean to work and walk, and visit and rest, at stated hours; already I have returned to the rigorous practice of the Badams system; I have thrown away my French cigars and all similar enjoyments, and taken to subsist on the <hi rend="italic">third part</hi> of an ordinary ration of food per day. The first sheet of <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>, I expect to-morrow: I will work at it and other things, in spite of the Fiend and <pb id="pg-03-201" n="03:201"/>all his emissaries. In these six or eight weeks too, I may begin to understand something of London and its resources; if my beggarly health be improved, I may continue; if not, there is Scotland, and gardening, and riding, and kindness that will never fail me, never tho&#x2019; all else should fail. Next letter I hope to tell you that my plan prospers, and that I am making progress tho&#x2019; it were an inch per day. Occupation, the strenuous exertion of our faculties in fulfilling the purposes of our conscience and will, I hold to be the only panacea for the sufferings of a mortal. I know it, and have long known it; strange that I should practice it so little!</p>
<p>Now, my dearest and best Jane, are you heartily sick of me and my plans, and most long-winded expositions and details? No, you are not: for we are friends, friends forever <supplied>[,one in]</supplied> affection, one in interests. I wish much that we knew each others wants and difficu<supplied>[lties]</supplied> more minutely. Will you send me a detail as long and candid? O that I were near you, that I saw you every day and hour! A thousand thoughts of you flit across my soul, and die unuttered; and when I write, nothing will go down on paper, that I most wish conveyed to you. Can you interpret for me? Have you too a heart that feels like mine? Are you kind to me? Do you believe that with all my follies from within, and mean obstructions from without, I wish to be an honest man, and love you as I love my life? Then be still good to me, and we will never part in this world or the next! &#x201C;Fool! what puts parting in thy head?&#x201D; I know not, unless it be that I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> a fool. Last night I was searching and sorting the contents of my desk, unopened since I left Scotland; there lay a little heart cut in paper, and another half cut within it, in the manner of your keep-lessons; on the inner one stood the word &#x201C;Homeless&#x201D; written in what I thought your hand! Has this little paper-heart been yours, and how in Heaven&#x2019;s name came it hither? Ten dirges are not equal to expressing the <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> affection, the <foreign><hi rend="italic">wehm&#xfc;thiges Sehnsucht</hi></foreign> [sad longing] that I viewed it with: I could have cried if I had liked; but I did not; I merely laid it by in my safest recess, beside some other valuables, pronounced myself to be a very weak young man (as well I might), and went on with the task of burning dull letters and all the trash of verses I could lay my hands on. Poor little heart! Do not laugh at me and it, you gipsey! I swear it was exceedingly pathetic.</p>
<p>I designed to write at large about your coming hither; for the Orator has got a letter, he says, and you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to come! Heaven grant you were here in safety! I myself will escort you home. Tell me <hi rend="italic">all <pb id="pg-03-202" n="03:202"/>about it</hi> when you write: I am to be your cicerone here? I have scarce visited one of the Lions, that we might enjoy the pleasures of wonder together. The orator is partly a fool, so is his dear Isabella; yet both of them are kind and good, and he does love you with the sort of love whereof his nature is susceptible. You will be happy for a month: Come! Come!&#x2014; But when will you write? or why have you not written ere now? If it was mere idleness I will forgive you; but if it was <hi rend="italic">indifference</hi> to me&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>!&#x2014;I will never forgive you, while I live. So look to it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Is the <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> done or begun yet? It will be wanted in some weeks: I will take no excuse; if you cannot do that, do something else. <hi rend="italic">How</hi> do you go on with your pupil? Tell me about Haddington, as far as it concerns yourself. What of the <hi rend="italic">Dugald crature</hi>? What of the little Doctor?&#x2014; Oh do write in one moment! Be a good girl and do! My kindest regards to your Mother: I have a three-halfpenny present for her from the <hi rend="italic">Palais Royal</hi>, which will make her laugh to look at it. There is also a grey-complexioned play-book for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.&#x2014; It is quite dark; and the post-hour is arrived! <closer><salute>Write, my Angel, write! I am yours forever and ever&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear</salute>
<p>What is all this about? I received your French letter on the 6<hi rend="italic">th</hi> or 7<hi rend="italic">th</hi>; I answered it on the 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi>; which, I think was as soon as a reasonable person would have expected, and before my letter has time to be at <hi rend="italic">Dover</hi>, you write again to ask &#x201C;what has happened.&#x201D; Was there ever such an impatient gentleman? However it must have been <hi rend="italic">my</hi> good genius that put it in your head to write the last letter; it arrived here so opportunely&#x2014;just five minutes after myself&#x2014;and helped to dissipate the saddness which I always feel when I return hither, and miss the welcome which once made home-coming delightful to me. How often do your letters bring me comfort Dearest! I wish there was a glass window in my heart that you might look into it; you can never know by words how much I love you, and how gratefully I feel your kindness.</p>
<p>Well! here I am once more, full of new plans and resolutions: Heaven grant they may not end in smoke! I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be diligent this <pb id="pg-03-203" n="03:203"/>winter,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">will</hi> if the Fates will only let me. But of this I am not at all clear&#x2014; For the last six weeks I have seldom been, three days at a time, without pain in my head; and now the gaieties of the Festival and the alarm of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Fire have made me even worse than usual&#x2014; The newspapers will have informed you of this calamitous business: unfortunately I was at George Square when it happened and Mr Bradfute being a party concerned we were kept, while it lasted, in continual agitation. I verily believe another night of it would have killed me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The great fire in the Old Town of Edinburgh, on the <date when="1824-11-15">15th</date>, <date when="1824-11-16">16th</date>, and <date when="1824-11-17">17th days of November, 1824</date>&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note). The fire broke out on Monday evening, <date when="1824-11-15">15 Nov.</date>, in the Old Assembly Court and spread to surrounding tenements. A new fire broke out on Tuesday evening in Parliament Square, destroying, among other places, Mr. Bradfute&#x2019;s shop. It was not controlled until Wednesday, and the ineffectiveness of those in charge was strongly criticized.</note> The hubbub of Tuesday increased my headach<supplied>[e]</supplied> to such a degree that I was quite insensible for several hours. I am still in a very shattered condition; and not at all fit for writing or doing anything that requires the least effort of thought. However I expect that the air of home and a few nights of sound sleep will set me all to rights again. I would have waited till I was able to write at greater length; only that, in case my other letter has not reached you, you might be fancying matters worse than they are.</p>
<p>Your present plan of life is quite to my mind<supplied>[;]</supplied> follow it out manfully and all will be well. I commence <hi rend="italic">my</hi> plan on Monday, if I am well by that time. I have done nothing yet but <hi rend="italic">bring order out of the chaos</hi> of Miss Gilchrist&#x2019;s goods and chattels.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>It grieves me to think that you must suffer the pains of suspense till Friday morning; but there is no remedy. By dint of what I thought a very strong effort, I scribbled you a full sheet last night, in spite of all calls and engagements; but just as I concluded it, I found that it was some minutes too late for the post, and must lie in Abchurch street till monday evening if I sent it, there being no departure or reception of mails here on Sunday. I judged it better to burn the luckless epistle and write you another more at leisure<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>Nothing could have been more welcome to me than your letter, the first that came to greet me in my new habitation. For six weeks I had suffered under a total famine of news from home; and had become not only eager for some friendly communing with you, but anxious also in gloomy hours lest something sinister might have happened. You did well to write without a moment&#x2019;s delay: I trust you will hold fast by so good a sample, and let me hear of all your doings with a regularity greater if possible than ever. tho&#x2019; separated in place we are united in interest and affection: let us sedulously employ all the means of intercourse that still remain to us.</p>
<p>The melancholy you allude to is a thing I do not wonder at, having often felt it myself. You are jaded with travelling, confused with change of place and business; for the first week you cannot be happy. Let the business of the winter once be fairly entered on, your books and apparatus gathered round you, and all will be well. Edinburgh is a cold abode for one like you; anxieties of many kinds haunt your too earnest temper, and there are no friends at hand to share and alleviate them. But live in hope, my boy; and when your heart feels <pb id="pg-03-205" n="03:205"/>friendless think of me. We are not alone in life, while we are both spared to front its difficulties side by side; and depend upon it, our united efforts will in the end prevail. I know you think darkly, as I used to do perhaps still more, of the world and the part you are to play in it: I love you more for this, my honest brother; but I can assure you it is all superfluous. With your talents and diligence, and genuine strength of mind, I fear not in the smallest to set you forth among the small characters that people this our planet, to fight your way among them to distinction and independance. I have not been in the habit of flattering you, nor do I think it safe for any one to make his happiness depend upon success superior to others; but this I will say, Jack, that I have no skill in men, if thou art not fitted to send thousands of common &#x201C;medical gentlemen&#x201D; to the right and left, in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> scene where they may meet thee. Fear not, my good Jack: thy head is clear and firm, and gifted more than thou believest; thy heart also is honest and affectionate and manly: join prudent culture of these endowments to judicious exposition of them to the public, and in due time the world is at thy bidding. This is certain as the Gospel; so think not of it for the present; think only of learning thy profession, and accomplishing as far as possible, thy general faculties: the rest will all come in proper course as it is wanted. Success to thee my own Jack! The more I know of thee, the prouder I am of our relation, the more confident of getting honour from it. Let us be true to ourselves, boy, and to one another; and there is no shade of fear.</p>
<p>I am rather glad than otherwise that you are to be alone this winter. Duncan<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duncan Church, his former roommate.</note> is a poor associate for you; fitter to chat an odd hour away with, than to live constantly beside. I fear you have few associates in Edinburgh; the few that you have endeavour to take the good of; dwell not too intently on your studies and personal interests; throw by your books often, and &#x201C;be unwise at a time.&#x201D; See Mitchell and Murray, George Irving, Church, any one rather than none, at short intervals; treat yourself with a novel from the circulating libraries once a week; go now and then to the theatre; and walk the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> of every Saturday. Mind these things; they are serious counsels: my <hi rend="italic">only</hi> fear for you is that you be <hi rend="italic">too</hi> intent on well doing; here there seems a real danger for you, yet I trust you will avoid it. Tell me minutely about your studies and reading and classes and pursuits. When you have graduated in the North, I think it will not be a bad scheme for you to go to Paris for a winter: I found while there that it would not <pb id="pg-03-206" n="03:206"/>by any means be impracticable. There were many Irishmen and Scotchmen in Cuvier&#x2019;s Amphitheatre, when I heard him lecture: of this, more when we meet. The point is to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> acquainted with your trade, to digest the facts and observations furnished to you, not in the memory, but in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> own intellect; so that <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, the daring Tongleg, not Dr Gregory<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either James or John Gregory. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190925-TC-JOFE-01">TC to <sic>JF</sic><corr>JOFE</corr>, <date when="1819-09-25">25 Sept. 1819</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220725-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1822-07-25">25 July 1822</date></ref>.</note> or Dr Good,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Mason Good. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18231216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1823-12-16">16 Dec. 1823</date></ref>.</note> but <hi rend="italic">you</hi> may know fully what is what, or know that you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> know it, when you leave class-rooms, and step forth into the complexities of actual practice. I see the many many difficulties to be conquered; but I know the force of the assailant also. Go on, like a true man, as you have begun, without pomp or pedantry, trusting to diligence and solid reflexion alone: the result is certain as aught that man can calculate on. Brave times, my Boy! When we are both philosophers; living perhaps under the same roof, remembering wherever we may be that we are brothers, and <hi rend="italic">backing one another out in several lines</hi> to the very last!</p>
<p>But I must tell you something of myself. The day you left Dumfries I left Dover with the Stracheys, the day you arrived in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I arrived in London about eight at night. Irving&#x2019;s hospitable home was open to me; but I longed to be in some establishment of my own; so after a sleep, and 12 hours of talk with the orator about Paris and its wonders, I set out in quest of lodgings. On Wednesday evening I was planted here, within three gunshots of him, in a place far better than I had expected. The landlady with a servant, both of the best and tidiest sort, an occasional ancient gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Missus</hi>&#x2019; former Master) at present in the topmost story, an asthmatic lady on the ground floor, and myself occupying <supplied>[the in]</supplied>termediate one, compose the whole household. My two apartments are of fair si<supplied>[ze and]</supplied> I think the best I have lived in; clean as a new guinea, even elegant; the parlour looki<supplied>[ng]</supplied> with two windows into a neat and not noisy street, the bedroom into green plots like those <hi rend="italic">awa doon i&#x2019; Pilrig</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pilrig was a quiet suburb of Edinburgh where Carlyle lodged.</note> with a trim space of grass and sanded walks and a pleasant-looking edifice beyond them. I like the whole very well; the people wait on me, and cook my Badamian victuals, with the regularity of an arithmetical mill: if I were perfect in the article of sleep, I should be altogether comfortable. Even this is far beyond what I had reason to anticipate in London; by good management, I may have six hours nightly of nearly absolute quiet, with which even if habit come not to my aid, I shall contrive to make a <pb id="pg-03-207" n="03:207"/>shift. Walking which I purpose to take in abundance I find a potent recipe; I do not fear growing worse in health if I attend to it. The cost is 16 / weekly excluding fires; the whole bill, I see, will reach as high as 35 / . This, I believe, is cheap for this most expensive of cities.</p>
<p>The printing of <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> was to have commenced ten days ago; but as yet I have not seen a sheet of it. These creeping things Taylor &#x26; Hess<supplied>[e]</supplied>y are going to be altogether dilatory in their movements, if I do not whip them into action. It will be eight or nine weeks at least before the book is done. I mean to scold them once a day, and try if I can get it finished sooner. It will be about as large as a volume of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>. I am introducing various extracts and enlargements: at present I am translating some scenes of <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi>; some of <hi rend="italic">Karlos</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Jungfrau</hi> are already done, some of <hi rend="italic">Tell</hi> are to follow. The poor thing is also to have a portrait of Schiller; on the whole, it will be a kind of <hi rend="italic">book</hi>, and live its six weeks like others.&#x2014; My ulterior plans are not yet fixed. While this business lasts, I must continue here: I will work a few hours daily, and spend the rest in walking and talking, and seeing all I can of London. After that, if I am not better than I can confidently expect, I must again alter my arrangements, most probably return to Scotland. Nothing I perceive will do but <hi rend="italic">setting up house</hi> somewhere or other, on a smaller or a larger scale! Here it must end, and the sooner, I think, the better. I have two or three schemes in agitation; you shall know them all by and by.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I shall do excellently well, considering every thing. I have company enough; some sorts of it far from disagreeable: I shall try by walking &#x26;c to procure <hi rend="italic">sufferable ease</hi>; I have many things and men whom I hope to see; I write about three hours per day, and read as many; and the time goes glibly, only too unprofitably, over. You shall hear more minutely by the next opportunity.&#x2014; Now, Jack, write without delay, and calculate on writing to me somewhere nearly once a week, while I am here. Tell me all thy doings, thy thoughts sad and joyful. Poor old <foreign>Reekie</foreign>! What a fierce and fearful scene of conflagration!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to the fire in the Old Town. &#x201C;Old <foreign>Reekie</foreign>&#x201D; was a nickname for Edinburgh.</note> Remember me to Cron, Murray, Mitchell. Murray&#x2019;s letter I will answer; it lay for me at Dover. I wrote to Frank Dickson; and to George Johnstone. Do thou write to me. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my good Jack! My kindest remembrances to Mainhill, and commands of the most pressing sort for Alick to write. <closer><salute>Good night! I am ever thine&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p><pb id="pg-03-208" n="03:208"/>[In margins:] Has any echo of tidings from the Targer<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Johnston.</note> reached you? I know not where among nations he is. The careless <foreign>sloot</foreign> [lazy person]! Will you send our mother tea &#x26;c and kind letters whenever you can. I wrote to her eight days ago.</p>
<p>This is a sorry business of the bill. Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> write my name on the back of it, and no questions will be asked. Shew <hi rend="italic">this</hi> for your authority, if it is needed. You are not in actual want of cash? Had it not been for double postage, I would have sent you some: but you need delay no longer.</p>
<p>Today was Irving&#x2019;s sacrament-day; but I was not there: I saw him an hour or two ago, nursing as usual. Last night I saw Allan Cunningham, Procter, &#x26;c.</p>
<p>Mind to write soon and fully. Good night! There is a wretched mortal with a voice like the howling of wolves, declaring to the earth for the twentieth time, that it is&#x2014;&#x201C;Paast ney-en.&#x201D; Good night, and peace be with thee, Jack! I am done.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I have an opportunity of sending up a parcel to Edinburgh by the conveyance of Taylor &#x26; Hessey&#x2019;s London Magazine; and I snatch a few hurried moments to write you a word or two along with the commissions to be entrusted to your charge. These letters you will put into the Penny-post office; the larger packet is for Haddington; the little one you can send home at your leisure.</p>
<p>You would get my letter on Friday morning: I trust it found you restored to your wonted composure, and following your occupations without disturbance from the fiends of sickness or melancholy. I long to hear from you again: write to me the moment you get hold of this, if you have not written before: never weary of unfolding to me all your hopes and fears; there is no other person for you in the world that has such an interest in listening to them; and I know not what better use I can make of my own hard-gathered experience than in using my endeavours to lighten the burden of life to a brother who loves me so truly, and so well deserves my love. Remember, as I have often told you and been told by you, that for all the ills of existence there is just <pb id="pg-03-209" n="03:209"/>one remedy, the sedulous employment of one&#x2019;s faculties in the business cut out for them, with as perfect an exclusion as possible of all thoughts and imaginations which do not in some shape tend to activity. Be patiently diligent in your vocation; exercise in continuing it the same manly spirit with which you have commenced it, and all will be well. I have no fears for your ultimate success: the path to honour and competence is difficult for people in our sphere of life; but you have strength and fortitude enough to conquer all that will oppose you. Tell me what you think of all these matters; describe your studies and pursuits and manner of existence; hide nothing from me.</p>
<p>For my own part, I am going on with moderate success and comfort. I feel unspeakably happier now that I have got my fate under my own management; that I can at least fight its thousand miseries with unshackled hands. I find my lodgings altogether comfortable; tho&#x2019; excessively expensive, they content me well. Were it not for the difficulty of procuring enough of sleep (the difficulty not the impossibility) I imagine even my health would improve here. As it is I get on very fairly: I work some three hours or so at <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> every morning; I go out and make calls, or see sights, or scold printers, till towards three o&#x2019;clock; then I have my tidy mutton-chop and four fiery-hot potatoes; after which I take to reading light works till my breadless tea, and then having perhaps taken another short walk, I sit down again to read or write or go and talk with some plausible character, till suppertime or bedtime. I can do little work; but I am not miserable nearly to the same extent as I have long been. I feel <hi rend="italic">determined</hi> to alter the figure of my fortune, and conscious too that I partly have the power of doing this.</p>
<p>My schemes are various, and as yet mostly very vague. Almost all of them involve <hi rend="italic">being in a house of my own</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle&#x2019;s poem &#x201C;My Own Four Walls,&#x201D; written later (A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 355&#x2013;56).</note> somewhere in the country, within reach of London or Edinburgh; I rather think of the latter. The means for keeping up that projected household are next to be devised. This letter to Brewster is on that subject; asking his advice about a proper Bookseller to undertake with me a translation of all <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x2019;s Works</hi>, which I have been meditating for some time. I am not to live or die as this scheme shall prosper or fail; but I anticipate considerable advantages from engaging with it. We shall hear what Brewster says about <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Trade; he knows their quirks and subterfuges and the character of every individual among them. Boyd I am loth to apply to; undoubtedly he is a knave. He has printed at least 1500 <pb id="pg-03-210" n="03:210"/>copies of this <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> as sure as fate: Whittaker himself <hi rend="italic">told</hi> me <supplied>[that he]</supplied> had sold 600 four months ago; and asked how many we had printed&#x2014;1500? Base Phrygian Turks! It does one&#x2019;s heart ill to be connected with them. Nevertheless, I do not know but I may be forced after all as the ill best resource to apply to the &#x201C;scooneril<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Scooneril</hi> is a Scots pronunciation of <hi rend="italic">scoundrel</hi>.</note> Boyd&#x201D; in this very business of Schiller&#x2019;s Works. He has cash and spirit, and goes thro&#x2019; the thing rapidly and manfully; and perhaps it is better to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> cheated within moderate limits than to have your patience frittered down by delays and drivellings, and calculations and hesitations. I feel a mixture of contempt and indignation at these pitiful triflers I at present have to do with. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> proof-sheet, deformed with inaccuracies, arrived about five minutes ago! They promise &#x201C;not above four sheets per week&#x201D;: it must be my care that they do not sink below two. However I have not yet done with my preparations; and when I have I can take to something else.</p>
<p>Allen<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matthew Allen. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200923-TC-MAL-01">TC to <sic>MA</sic><corr>MAL</corr>, <date when="1820-09-23">23 Sept. 1820</date></ref>.</note> of York is here at present; setting up a sort of &#x201C;Asylum&#x201D;; having left that of York, and being now solely on his own footing. He is a kind hearted sort of creature, after all; but woefully destitute of <hi rend="italic">pluck</hi> and perseverance. He wishes me to go out and live with him at his house in Epping forest (12 miles off): he will board me and a horse for forty pounds a year! That scheme <hi rend="italic">will not</hi> answer; there is folly enough within my reach already, without going to seek it among the professedly insane. Perhaps I may go and stay with him a week or so, when I have finished the writing of this Book.</p>
<p>I have yet made but little progress in my survey of London; the weather has been very unpropitious, and I have had many things to do. I have several persons (Mrs Montagu, Mrs Strachey, Procter &#x26;c) whom I call on now and then, and might far oftener if I found it useful. They are kind persons; particularly the first two: but for rational employment of my mind in their company, there is but very little. People of elevated minds and clear judgements seem to be as rare here as in the north. Any thing approaching to a <hi rend="italic">great character</hi> is a treasure I have yet to meet with. Yet such is life; the little that is good in it we ought to welcome, and forget how much better it might have been, when we think how much worse it generally is. These two women and their families treat me as if I were a near relation; not a wandering stranger: I feel their kindness, and hope yet to profit more by it. Basil Montague, the husband, was described to me as a <pb id="pg-03-211" n="03:211"/>philosopher; I find him to be an honest-hearted&#x2014;&#x2014;goose! Happy Irving who sees in all his friends the pink of human excellence; and when he has found the nakedness of the land,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 42:9.</note> can turn him round and seek a fresh supply! He is still fighting away as valiantly as ever, nursing and preaching. His popularity is growing steadier, and I think will ultimately settle into something comfortable and accordant with the nature of things. The fashionable people have long ago forgot that he exists; and our worthy Preacher has discovered, fortunately not too late, that <hi rend="italic">many</hi> things &#x201C;since the Reformation&#x201D; have been more surprising than to grow a London Lion for the space of three little months. I am glad with all my heart that this insane work is over. Irving is becoming known to men at large <hi rend="italic">as he is</hi>: the sceptical and literary people find that he is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a quack, and they honour him, or at least let him live in peace. There are many persons of warm hearts and half-cultivated heads who love him and admire him, and I think will stand by him firmly; all that have ever known him in private must and do like him. Delivered from the gross incense of preaching popularity, Irving will cultivate his mind in peace; and may ray out a profitable mixture of light and darkness upon a much wider public than he has yet addressed by writing. After all, he is a brave fellow; among the best, if not the very best, whom I have met in life. Success to him! For tho&#x2019; I laugh at him, I were a dog if I did not love him. Speak not of his popularity: your words will be interpreted to mean, not that it is growing rational, but that it is over. At present, I reckon the appearance of it better than it has ever been.</p>
<p>Now, Jacky boy, thou must write directly: I have got an Examiner Newspaper, which I will send thee off on Wednesday, and as regularly afterwards as I can manage. The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> never reaches me: yet Alick says he sends it. I suspect his writing is illegible, or that he forgets the &#x201C;Pentonville,&#x201D; a fatal omission, for of Southampton-streets I reckon there <supplied>[are]</supplied> a dozen in this city.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The directory for <date when="1822">1822</date> lists only two Southampton Streets, but gives nine names of streets such as Southampton Court, Southampton Row, etc. in which the word occurs.</note></p>
<p>Send me every word of news: take a long sheet, and the closest type your time will suffer. Good b&#x2019;ye, my own Tongleg! Send on the Examiner to Mainhill, if thou please.&#x2014; <closer><salute>I am ever thine,</salute></closer></p>

<p>I have no time to write a word of sense or even of nonsense to-day: these <hi rend="italic">miserables</hi> are sending off a packet of magazines to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and I take the opportunity of cramming in along with them a few books for you.

You are very good, and mindful of me. How is your naughty head? Has the fresh air and quietude of home restored you? Heaven grant it may!

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I despatched a parcel of books and other ware for you, the other day; directed to the care of Brother Jonathan: I expect you will receive it sometime early next week. It contains no letter; only a hasty line, expressive of my earnest wish and persuasion that you would write to me directly on its arrival. I engaged also to have a letter in your hands before that time. There is something Hibernian, you will say, in the notion of a <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> to be fulfilled before it can be known: but there would be something worse than Hibernian did I fail to fulfil it. The latter evil I am now in the act of preventing.</p>
<p>Both your letters are in my possession: kind creature that you are to write to me so pointedly and faithfully! I should have been in a wo<supplied>[e]</supplied>ful pucker had you trusted to the Dover postmaster; the friendly sheet would have lain two months in their Dead Letter office here, and never reached <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at all. But my anxieties were cleared away; you sent a little messenger of peace and affection out to greet me; it circulated thro&#x2019; all the chaotic correspondence of this busy Island, and found me in my solitude at the anticipated hour, and cheered my heart with <pb id="pg-03-213" n="03:213"/>images of past and future happiness. Even your sickness I have striven to make light of: I will not let myself believe that it is more than temporary; and the serious mood you partly owe to it, is that in which to me you are by far most interesting. Do not mock and laugh, however gracefully, when you can help it! But for your own sake, I had almost rather see you sad. It is the earnest, affectionate, warm-hearted, enthusiastic Jane that I <hi rend="italic">love</hi>; the acute, sarcastic, clear-sighted, derisive Jane I can at best but <hi rend="italic">admire</hi>. Is it not a pity you had such a turn that way? &#x201C;Pity rather that the follies of the world, and yours among the number, Mr Quack, should so often call for castigation!&#x201D; Well, well! Be it so then! A wilful man, and still more a wilful woman, must and will have her way. After all, you are a good girl take you as we like; I have a small touch of love for you at the bottom of my heart in spite of every thing, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Voila quelque chose devilish strange</hi></foreign> [&#x201C;There is something devilish strange&#x201D;: last two words underscored twice]!&#x201D; as Strachey said: I scarcely think you can believe it.&#x2014; Now let us turn over a new leaf! A new leaf in the paper, and still more in the subject!</p>
<p>I am meditating with as rigid an intensity as ever, on the great focus of all purposes at present, the arranging of my future life. Here is no light business, and no want of eagerness in me to see it done! As yet, I have made no way or very little; but already I am far happier than I was, from the mere consideration that my destiny, with all its manifold entanglements, perplexing and tormenting as they are, is now submitted to my own management. Freedom is the very life of man! Let difficulties oppress you as they please, do but satisfy your conscience that you are straining every nerve to remedy them, and the very search for peace in some degree is peace.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John Donne&#x2019;s &#x201C;All the way to Heaven is Heaven&#x201D; in &#x201C;Sermon LXVI.&#x201D;</note> Of my projects I can give no description; they fluctuate from day to day; and many of them are not of a kind to be explained in writing. Why will you not come directly, that I might talk with you for months, and persuade you and be persuaded? One item lies at the bottom of almost every scheme I form: it is a determination to have some household of my own; some abode which I may be the lord of, tho&#x2019; it were no better than the cynic&#x2019;s tub; some abiding home, which I may keep myself in peace by the hope of improving, not of changing for another. I have lived too long in tents, a wandering Bedouin; the fruit of my toils wasted, or spent in the day that witnessed them: I feel the sad effects of that arrangement; every hour they are becoming sadder. The point, then, is to alter it, to find the means of altering it. O thou detested <pb id="pg-03-214" n="03:214"/>Fiend, Disease! most hideous of the progeny of Tophet!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Jer. 7:30&#x2013;34.</note> Could I but meet thee in some questionable shape, tho&#x2019; it were frightful as the Hyrcanian Tiger, that I might grapple with thee, and kill thee, and scatter thy fragments to the four winds of Heaven! But it is vain to imprecate: Ernulphus<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230810-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-08-10">10 Aug. 1823</date></ref>.</note> himself could make no impression here. I am sick, and must recover; and if so, in sickness itself provide the helps for getting out of it. Till then my mind lies spell-bound, the best of my talents (bless the mark!) shut up even from my own view, and the thought of writing any thing beyond mere drudgery is vain. I see all this: but I also see the plan of conquering it, if it can be conquered. I must settle myself down within reach of Edinburgh or London: I must divide my time between mental and bodily exercises; if the latter could be turned to profit, could be regularly fixed and ordered by necessity of any kind, I should regard the point as gained. Had I land of my own, I should instantly be tempted to become a &#x2014;farmer! Laugh outright! But it is very true. I think how I should mount on horseback in the grey of the morning; and go forth like a destroying angel among my lazy hinds; quickening every sluggish hand; cultivating and clearing, tilling and planting, till the place became a very garden round me! In the intermediate hours, I could work at literature; thus <hi rend="italic">compelled</hi> to live according to the wants of Nature, in one twelvemonth, I should <supplied>[be]</supplied> the healthiest man in three parishes; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>&#x2014;if I said or did nothing notable, it were my own blame, or Nature&#x2019;s only. This, you say, is Utopian dreaming, not the sober scheme of a man in his senses. I am sorry for it; sorry that nothing half so likely to save me comes within the circuit of my capabilities: I must try to make the nearest possible approximation to it. A sinecure!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See the reference to Irving in <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241110-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1824-11-10">10 Nov.</date></ref></note> God bless thee, my Darling! I could not touch a sinecure tho&#x2019; twenty of my friends (not one of whom has any shadow of a wish or power that way) should volunteer to offer it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Keineswegs</hi></foreign> [not in the least]! It is no part of my plan to eat the bread of idleness, so long as I have the force of a sparrow left in me to procure the honest bread of industry. Irving, too! Good Irving! His thoughts are friendly, but he expresses them like a goose. &#x201C;Help me to the uttermost&#x201D;! If he can help himself to get along &#x201C;the path thro&#x2019; life,&#x201D; it is all that I shall ask of him. If his own shins are safe at the journey&#x2019;s end (a point on which there are many doubts), let him hang a votive tablet up, and go to bed in peace: I shall manage mine. There is no use in &#x201C;helps&#x201D;; the grown up man that cannot be his own help ought to <pb id="pg-03-215" n="03:215"/>solicit his discharge from the church militant, and turn him to some milder region, by the very earliest conveyance. For affection or the faintest imitation of it a man should feel obliged to his very dog; but for the gross assistances of patronage or purse, let him pause before accepting them from any one; let him utterly refuse them except from beings that are enshrined in his heart of hearts, and from whom no chance <hi rend="italic">can</hi> divide him. It is the law in Yarmouth that &#x201C;every herring hang by its own head&#x201D;: except in cases singularly wretched, or singularly happy, that judicious principle, I think, should also govern life.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A fundamental statement from Carlyle which helps to explain his great admiration for Samuel Johnson and his highly critical attitude toward Coleridge.</note></p>
<p>But it is time to turn from these most selfish speculations, to you, whom I should not overburden, tho&#x2019; I feel that I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> wearied you, with talking to them. When, when shall I see you? You cannot think what need I have, for a thousand reasons, to discourse with <supplied>[you]</supplied> at large and long. How many things are there which it is necessary for me to understand <supplied>[, how]</supplied> many counsels and explanations and exhortations to give and to receive! Could you not come forthwith? There is no end to this Cousin and his doubts. And what a thing would it be, if I were gone when you arrived! They are getting on with that printing business, at a snail&#x2019;s pace; but six or seven weeks will see them thro&#x2019; it; and then I have nothing to detain me here. My future movements must be regulated by the face of circumstances: in my present situation, I have no intention to continue. The orator is gone for two weeks, or I would ask him about your weary visit, this very day. He is not misleading you about his house: like most London houses it is hampered and unsubstantial; you will find your accommodation far below what you have been accustomed to at home. Mrs Irving is no bad person: kindliness and affectation are her leading features; what a <foreign>pudder</foreign> there will be when you arrive! For the winter she has a sister with her; rather less unbeautiful and more affected and about as kindly. Of neither will you make an intimate, or more than a frank but trivial, every-day companion; and it will be incumbent on you daily to take some little pains with <hi rend="italic">Him</hi>. On the whole, I fear I am selfish in wishing you so much to come. As a town London is not worth looking at above a week; and I know scarcely one or two of Irving&#x2019;s friends whom you are likely to take pleasure in, or draw advantage from. There is no truly intellectual person in his list; scarcely, indeed, in London. For my part, at least, I must say that I have fallen in with none: any thing resembling a &#x201C;great man,&#x201D; a man exercised with <pb id="pg-03-216" n="03:216"/>sublime thoughts and emotions, able even to participate in such, and throw any light on them, is a treasure I have yet to meet with. Nevertheless, it has much in it, this monster of a city, that will amuse you and awaken you to new thoughts; and with all its imperfections it is London, the London every one delights to see or to have seen. I have held up the soberest view of it; and still, I think, I would have you risk it for a few weeks. It would be so delightful for <hi rend="italic">us both</hi> to see it; and I would escort you home in person! The orator&#x2019;s house is as ready now, as it will ever be; and for your Cousin he is not to <supplied>[be]</supplied> counted on. Tell me what you think; and I will question the Orator the moment he returns. I think, either you should make up your mind to come soon, or for the present to renounce the project altogether. Perhaps it is only that I <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> it so, and <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> that I &#x201C;think&#x201D; it. Consider my temptations: and take them into the account.&#x2014; But enough of this topic! Far too much of it, considering its real importance! Let us decide it, and be done with it.&#x2014; Now will you write to me, with <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that is in your heart? Would that there <hi rend="italic">were</hi> &#x201C;a glass-window&#x201D; in that best of hearts, and that I (alone) could read what passed within it! How many things might then perhaps be clear and fixed, which now are dim and fluctuating! But the time is coming, the time that will decide. Shall I love you forever, or am I fool for loving you at all? I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> love you to the end of time, betide what may!&#x2014; Now write, write, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Meine Eigene</hi></foreign> [my very own]; write soon and largely, and tell me all, all!&#x2014; The moment you get the parcel&#x2014;if not before!&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my Dearest!

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>The arrival of the &#x201C;Courier&#x201D; (it comes regularly on Monday about noon) puts me in mind of a duty, which I have neglected too long. I hope you have felt no anxiety on my account, I have been as well in health as usual, and much happier in spirits. You know the old rule, when I do not write, infer that nothing is the matter with me: I have pledged myself again and again to send you instant word if any thing should ail me. For my own sake I have inducement enough to write: to talk with you about our mutual doings and purposes is among my most delightful occupations, knowing and feeling as I do how honest and how warm an interest we take in every thing relating to each other.</p>
<p>Your letter found me in due season; and a welcome visitant it was. I had not got the &#x201C;Courier&#x201D; that preceded it, and the intelligence of your proceedings and welfare was no small relief to me. You must thank our Mother in my name in the warmest terms for her kind note, which I have read again and again with an attention rarely given to more polished compositions. The sight of her rough true-hearted writing is more to me than the finest penmanship and the choicest rhetoric. It takes me home to honest kindness, and affection that will never never fail me. You also I must thank for your graphic picture of Mainhill and its neighbourhood. How many changes happen in this restless roundabout of life within a little space! The poor Quack Miller forced from his dearly-beloved bags, and his simple sister heiress of thousands! How or what is she doing with it? Are sycophants gathering round the shallow &#x201C;Gheen&#x201D; to filch it from her? Has she changed her style of Life, and how? Her inheritance seems stranger to me than a novel.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Old Laird Millar &#x2026; a man little beloved in life or lamented in death,&#x201D; reports Alick in his letter of <date when="1824-11-21">21 Nov.</date>, had somehow amassed a fortune, taken to drink, given much of his money away to &#x201C;greedy vagabonds,&#x201D; and at the same time nearly starved to death a daughter and his sister, the shallow &#x201C;Gheen.&#x201D; The latter is now an heiress, but &#x201C;tarred with the same stick&#x201D; as her brother. &#x201C;Will she return me half a crown that I once gave her,&#x201D; Alick asks, &#x201C;when her purse and her stomach poor g<supplied>[h]</supplied>een were alike empty? But I care not a doite whether or no.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-218" n="03:218"/>In London, or rather in my own small sphere of it, there has nothing sinister occurred since I wrote last. After abundant scolding, what sometimes rose to the very borders of bullying, these unhappy people are proceeding pretty regularly with <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Book; a fifth part of it is already printed; they are also getting a portrait of <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> engraved for it; and I hope in about six weeks the thing will be off my hands. It will make a reasonable-looking book; somewhat larger than a volume of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, and done in somewhat of the same style. In the course of printing I have various matters to attend to; proofs to read; additions, alterations to make; which furnishes me with a very <hi rend="italic">canny</hi> occupation for the portion of the day I can devote to labour. I work some three or four hours; read, for amusement chiefly, about as long; walk about these dingy streets, and talk with originals for the rest of the day. On the whole I have not been happier for many a long month: I feel content to let things take their turn till I am free of my engagements; and then&#x2014;for a stern and serious <foreign><hi rend="italic">tuffle</hi></foreign> [struggle] with my Fate, which I have vowed and determined to alter from the very bottom, health and all! This <hi rend="italic">will not</hi> be impossible, or even I think extremely difficult. Far beyond a million of &#x201C;weaker vessels&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Pet. 3:7.</note> than I are sailing very comfortably along the tide of life just here. What good is it to whine and whimper? Let every man that has an ounce of strength in him, get up and put it forth in Heaven&#x2019;s name, and labour that his &#x201C;soul may live.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isa. 55:3.</note></p>
<p>Of this enormous Babel of a place I can give you no account in writing: it is like the heart of all the universe; and the flood of human effort rolls out of it and into it with a violence that almost appals one&#x2019;s every sense. Paris scarcely occupies a quarter of the ground, and does not seem to have the twentieth part of the business. O that our father <foreign>sey</foreign> [saw] Holborn in a fog! with the black vapour brooding over it, absolutely like fluid ink; and coaches and wains and sheep and oxen and wild people rushing on with bellowings and shrieks and thundering din as if the earth in general were gone distracted. To-day I chanced to pass thro&#x2019; Smithfield, when the market was three fourths over: I mounted the steps of a door, and looked abroad upon the area, an irregular space of perhaps thirty acres in extent, encircled with old dingy brick-built houses, and intersected with wooden pens for the <pb id="pg-03-219" n="03:219"/>cattle. What a scene! Innumerable herds of fat oxen, tied in long rows, or passing at a trot to their several shambles; and thousands of graziers, drovers, butchers, cattle-brokers with their quilted frocks and long goads pushing on the hapless beasts; hurrying to and fro in confused parties, shouting, jostling, cursing, in the midst of rain and <foreign><hi rend="italic">shairn</hi></foreign> [dung] and braying discord such as the imagination cannot figure.&#x2014; Then there are stately streets and squares, and calm green recesses to which nothing of this abomination is permitted to enter. No wonder Cobbett calls the place a Wen! It is a monstrous Wen!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Rural Rides</hi> (London, <date when="1885">1885</date>), I, 32: &#x201C;But what is to be the fate of the great wen of all? the monster, called &#x2026; &#x2018;the metropolis of the empire&#x2019;?&#x201D;</note> The thick smoke of it beclouds a space of thirty square miles; and a million of vehicles, from the dog- or <foreign>cuddy</foreign>-barrow to the giant waggon, grind along its streets forever. I saw a six-horse wain the other day with, I think, Number 200,000 and odd upon it!</p>
<p>There is an excitement in all this, which is pleasant as a transitory feeling, but much against my taste as a permanent one. I had much rather visit London from time to time, than live in it. There is in fact no <hi rend="italic">right</hi> life in it that I can find: the people are situated here like plants in a hot house, to which the quiet influences of sky and earth are never in their unadulterated state admitted. It is the case with all ranks: the carman with his huge slouch hat hanging halfway down his back, consumes his breakfast of bread and tallow or hog&#x2019;s lard, sometimes as he swags along the streets, always in a hurried and precarious fashion, and supplies the deficit by continual pipes and pots of beer. The fashionable lady rises at three in the afternoon, and begins to live toward midnight. Between these two extremes, the same false and tumultuous manner of existence more or less infects all ranks. It seems as if you were forever in &#x201C;an inn&#x201D;; the feeling of <hi rend="italic">home</hi> in our acceptation of the term is not known to one of a thousand. You are packed into paltry shells of brick-houses (calculated to endure for forty years, and then fall); every door that slams to in the street is audible in your most secret chamber; the necessaries of life are hawked about thro&#x2019; multitudes of hands, and reach you, frequently adulterated, always at rather more than <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> their cost elsewhere; people&#x2019;s friends must visit them by rule and measure; and when you issue from your door, you are assailed by vast shoals of quacks, and showmen, and street-sweepers, and pickpockets, and mendicants of every degree and shape, all plying in noise or silent craft their several vocations, all in their hearts like &#x201C;lions ravening for their prey.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ezek. 22:25.</note> The blackguard population <pb id="pg-03-220" n="03:220"/>of the place is the most consummately blackguard of any thing I ever saw.</p>
<p>Yet the people are in general a frank, jolly, <hi rend="italic">well-living</hi>, kindly people. You get a certain way in their good graces with great ease: they want little more with you than now and then a piece of recreating conversation, and you are quickly on terms for giving and receiving it. Father, I suspect, their nature or their habits seldom carry or admit them. I have found one or two strange mortals, whom I sometimes stare to see myself beside. There is Crabbe Robinson, an old Templar (Advocate dwelling in the Temple) who gives me coffee and <hi rend="italic">Sally-Lunns</hi> (a sort of buttered roll), and German books, and talk by the gallon in a minute. His windows look into&#x2014;Alsatia!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The White Friars district of London, which from early times till the abolition of all privileges of <date when="1697">1697</date> was a sanctuary for debtors and law-breakers; one contemporary observed that &#x201C;the scum of mankind took refuge&#x201D; there. We have Crabb Robinson&#x2019;s account of his meeting with Carlyle at this time: &#x201C;<date when="1824-12-10"><hi rend="italic">December 10th</hi></date>. Took tea at home. Mr Carlyle with me. He presses me to write an account of my recollections of Schiller for his book.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Diary, Reminiscences, and Correspondence of Henry Crabb Robinson</hi>, selected and edited by Thomas Sadler (London, <date when="1872">1872</date>), I, 413. Cf. also <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240712-TC-HCR-01">TC to HCR, <date when="1824-07-12">12 July</date></ref>.</note> With the Montagues I, once a week or so, step in and chat away a friendly hour: they are good clever people, tho&#x2019; their goodness and cleverness are strangely mingled with absurdity in word and deed. They like me very well: I saw Badams ther<supplied>[e l]</supplied>ast night; I am to see him more at large tomorrow or soon after. Mrs <supplied>[Strachey]</supplied> has tw<supplied>[ice co]</supplied>me to see me&#x2014;in her carriage, a circumstance of strange omen to our worthy <supplied>[friend.]</supplied> I had a long long talk with her and Mrs Buller the other day. Poor Charlie likes Cambridge ill, and runs a risk of becoming a dandy and a dissipated person: I trust, not. Mrs Buller <hi rend="italic">has</hi> settled at Shooter&#x2019;s Hill; after all her thousand schemes and counter-schemes here she is where she began! Irving and I have promised to come out and visit them. Among the poets I see Procter and Allan Cunningham as often as I like: the other night I had a second and much longer talk with Campbell. I went over with one Macbeth,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A man &#x201C;who had failed of a Kirk,&#x2014;as he deserved to do, though his talents were good;&#x2014;and was now hanging very miscellaneously on London, with no outlooks that were not bog meteors, and a steadily increasing tendency to strong drink&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 137). Probably John Macbeth, A.M.</note> not the &#x201C;Usurper,&#x201D; but a hapless Preacher from Scotland, whose gifts coupled with their drawbacks cannot earn him bread in London, tho&#x2019; Campbell and Irving and many more are doing all they can for him. Thomas is a clever man, and we had a much more pleasant conversation than our first; but I do not think my view of him was materially altered. He is vain <pb id="pg-03-221" n="03:221"/>and dry in heart; the brilliancy of his mind (which will not dazzle you to death after all) is like the glitter of an iceberg in the Greenland seas; parts of it are beautiful, but it is cold, cold, and you would rather look at it than touch it. I partly feel for Campbell: his early life was a tissue of wretchedness (here in London he has lived upon a pennyworth of milk and a penny-roll per day); and at length his soul has got encrusted as with a case of iron; and he has betaken himself to sneering and selfishness&#x2014;a common issue!</p>
<p>Irving I see as frequently and kindly as ever. His church and boy occupy him him [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] much. The <hi rend="italic">madness</hi> of his popularity is altogether over; and he must content himself with playing a much lower game than he once anticipated; nevertheless I imagine he will do much good in London, where many men like him are greatly wanted. His wife and he are always good to me.</p>
<p>Respecting my future movements I can predict nothing certain yet. It is not improbable, I think, that I may see you all in Scotland before many weeks are come and gone. Here at any rate, in my present circumstances I do not mean to stay: it is expensive beyond measure (two guineas a week or thereby for the mere items of bed and board); and I must have a <hi rend="italic">permanent</hi> abode of some kind devised for myself, if I mean to do any good. Within reach of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or London, it matters little which. You have not yet determined upon leaving or retaining Mainhill? I think it is a pity that you had not some more kindly spot: at all events a better house I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have. Is Mainholm let? By clubbing our capitals, together we might make something of it. A house in the country, and a horse to ride on, I must and will have if it be possible. Tell me all your views on these things, when you write.</p>
<p>Meanwhile things go on with me as snugly as I could expect. My lodgings and landlady are greatly to my mind. Except in the article of cheapness, and now and then of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> I have nothing to desire. Yet for six hours or more every night there is deep quiet, and in general I manage altogether well. The substantial tidy woman cooks me my eggs (fresh at 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> each, rotten 1&#xBD;<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) and mutton chop and potatoes in unequalled style. On the whole I do well for the present; and the future is in my own hands to make and manage as I list. I have thoughts of undertaking a complete translation of Schiller&#x2019;s works; but nothing is yet settled: I have written to Brewster for advice.&#x2014; Did you get a parcel thro&#x2019; Jack from me? If not it will come soon. Does Jack send you the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> newspaper regularly? I mean to send it regularly to him; tho&#x2019; in point of talent, it is much fallen off, and in point of <pb id="pg-03-222" n="03:222"/>principle it is as bad as ever. It will carry a <foreign><hi rend="italic">ganz wohl</hi></foreign> between us, and that is enough. Now mind, Boy, you promised to write <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>! Do, write the very first vacant hour after this arrives: I will answer you instantly. Good night! my dear Alick! <closer><salute>I am ever your aff<hi rend="italic">e</hi> Brother&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>
<ps><p>Neglect not to assure every mortal at Mainhill of my unaltered love, and to ask from them for me a like return. There was a note for Mag in the parcel, and four French needle-cases! Tell me about my Mother and her health, and all she says or does. My Father owes me a letter; I must put him to the horn [proclaim him an outlaw] if he do not pay it.</p>
<p>My Mother must write her own postscript in your letter. Tell her to eat dozens of half-boiled eggs, and eggs-and-milk, also to take now and then a little wine. Tea, hot tea, is necessary for her <hi rend="italic">every</hi> day.</p>
<p>Did you lend Waugh the pony? And how is he prospering? Do you ever hear of poor Bardolph? Does the <hi rend="italic">Child</hi> ever visit you? Make my respects to him. Does he stir his fins yet&#x2014;or merely his tongue?</p> 
<p>Soot-drop Moyes (your old crony) is here as a clerk: I saw him and George Beveridge at Irvings chapel, yesterday. Soot-drop asked for you kindly.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Were it not that no philosopher, not even a dyspeptical philosopher, is allowed in any case to get angry, I should at this moment be in a furious passion with these reptile booksellers Taylor &#x26; Hess<supplied>[e]</supplied>y. On receiving your letter, I went down to Fleet-street, and found the parcel, which they had hurried me to get ready by a certain hour about three weeks before&#x2014;still lying on their shelves! They haggled and grunted at some show of an apology; but I told them it was little matter, and took home the article in my hand, and have it now beside me. Had it not been for letters that were in it, I should not have cared: but there were several (one from Paris in particular entrusted to me by Dupin) that could not well brook delay. Arthur Buller, too! Poor flimsy, windy Arthur! The day before yesterday, he promised, about twenty times, to bring me a frank, and&#x2014;came not. Would to Heaven <pb id="pg-03-223" n="03:223"/>there were not such a thing as untruth in the world! But never mind, my Boy; thanks to our Sovereign lord the King&#x2019;s necessities, mail coaches are continually in motion; &#x26; for a certain stated quantity of copper-coin any man may have the benefit of them. I will wait no longer for their franks and chances; but write to you, and let the parcel follow when it can.</p>
<p>I thank you heartily for your kind and sensible letter; and rejoice not a little to hear that things go on so well with you. Pursue the same steadfast manly path, and doubt not we shall yet conquer the world between us. You are right to mingle other studies, in a subordinate degree, with that of medicine: I would not wish to see you a mere medical tradesman, however expert; and besides I hold it for a well established fact that excellence in one line of science can never be secured effectually without at least a moderate acquaintance with all. The German language will not fail to profit and distinguish you: it is well to pursue the study of it in the way you do. If once you had your Doctorate, I even think it might be very useful to translate some medical work from that school, and this I imagine it will not be difficult to find means for doing. Follow your Latin also; and count on writing your own <supplied>[thes]</supplied>is. What a paltry thing to smuggle yourself thro&#x2019; a fair trial under the <hi rend="italic">tawdry</hi> wing of a poor half-plucked <hi rend="italic">Grinder</hi>!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A coach in Latin who crams the student.</note> No custom can render it respectable, or for a man of spirit, tolerable. Poor Jack! There has he struggled in his own homely way, till he has mastered languages ancient and modern, and sciences useful and ornamental on his own footing! Push away my gallant Tongleg! there is no fear of thee. As to general reading, I need give you little direction. Dryden&#x2019;s poems you will perfectly understand, tho&#x2019; perhaps not relish greatly: try them and his plays, if they come to your hand. It was a plan I used to follow myself, and could approve of in you, to read a little of some simple and refreshing book every night before bed-time, after the studies of the day were concluded. <hi rend="italic">Sismondi&#x2019;s Litt&#xE9;rature du Midi</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">De la litt&#xE9;rature du Midi de l&#x2019;Europe</hi> (Paris, <date when="1813">1813</date>).</note> will suit you much better than any thing: get it out and read it, and you will not fail to relish it. As to the <hi rend="italic">Novum Organum</hi>, from personal experience I can say nothing or extremely little: the Scotch people and certain of the French have made a mighty fuss about it, most part of which you would do well to forget before reading the work itself: yet it is a book one <hi rend="italic">has</hi> to read; and if you find it profitable for you at present, the present is as good as any <pb id="pg-03-224" n="03:224"/>other time for reading it. Frank Dickson knows nothing whatever about it; you have judged rightly about his professions and pretendings; he is an ill-informed man, anywhere but among Scotch preachers, in spite of all his vapourings. Richmond<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230510-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1823-05-10">10</date> and <date when="1823-05-11">11 May 1823</date></ref>.</note> too is certainly close upon the borders of fatuity: for my sins, I found him on the coach-roof with me last summer, in going out to Haddington; I thought him the most vulgar senseless noisy bagpipe in the shire of Mid Lothian. <hi rend="italic">Hellebore</hi>, or perhaps in preference, <hi rend="italic">Iphecacuahna</hi> [ipecac], should be given him in large doses. Mind none of these windy-brains, my Boy Jack! The road to knowledge lies plain before thee as them: thou hast limbs and heart to travel it, and some of them have neither; jog along and heed them not. There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no short cut: they have but placed themselves in Bragging Castle, a dirty booth of pasteboard when inspected narrowly; there let them sit, and &#x201C;smite their [Jew&#x2019;s]<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brackets are Carlyle&#x2019;s.</note> harps of&#x201D; tin, and chant their jingling ditties, which will deceive no true pilgrim to the Shrine of Knowledge.</p>
<p>I am glad you have recovered your spirits, as I predicted; and are not inattentive to the recreations and entertainments which lie within your reach. Visit your acquaintance<supplied>[s]</supplied> frequently, and talk with them largely. Go to Paisley by all manner of means: the people will be glad to see you for your own sake; the Carlyles there are worthy persons, and to the full as <hi rend="italic">clannish</hi> as we in the South. Make my best respects to all that bear the name.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 77, Carlyle speaks of the Paisley Carlyles as &#x201C;certain &#x2018;Carliles&#x2019; (so they spelt their name); &#x2018;Annan people&#x2019; of a century back.&#x201D;</note> Also call on David Hope Brunswick-street Glasgow; and pay him an old tobacco-sc<supplied>[o]</supplied>re <supplied>[o]</supplied>f mine (contracted at Kinnaird): it is somewhat below a pound. I hope this day week, you will be travelling thither with the speed of four strong horses, and speculating with the nascent philosopher on all manner of topics. In Glasgow, if you have time, go and look at the High Church, the College, and the Tontine reading room to see the &#x201C;filthy <foreign>gutty hallions</foreign>&#x201D; studying the news of an evening.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Tontine Coffee House, opened in <date when="1794">1794</date>, was a meeting place for Glasgow merchants. Dougal in <hi rend="italic">Rob Roy</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1818">1818</date>), II, 176, refers to the bailies of the city (who would be drawn from among the merchants) as &#x201C;ta filthy, <foreign>gutty hallions</foreign>&#x201D; [filthy, gross rascals]. But in <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 71, Carlyle says that on a visit to Glasgow he saw in the Tontine &#x201C;several hundreds of &#x2026; fine, clean, opulent, and enviable or amiable-looking good Scotch gentlemen, sauntering about in trustful gossip, or solidly reading their newspapers.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>I am going on here quite as well as formerly. My health is sufferable, and my spirits good. <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x2019;s Life</hi> is printing with more rapidity <pb id="pg-03-225" n="03:225"/>than I once expected. I put the sixth sheet thro&#x2019; my hands yesterday; and expect the seventh to night. It will be rather a handsome book; somewhat larger than a volume of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, with a portrait, at present in the hands of the Engraver. I work a little at it; then go exploring the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wen</hi></foreign> [underscored twice], and talking with humane souls wherever I can find them. I have not talked so much for many months as I have done within the last six weeks. I suppose my nerves are sounder; tho&#x2019; I sleep too lightly, and am perpetually swallowing drugs. &#x201C;Starvation must be my Salvation,&#x201D; as the oracle pronounced it: in the course of time I shall be well. Perhaps I may come to Scotland, directly after Schiller is off my hands. I have for some time had a project of translating all his Works, if I could find encouragement: Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on the whole would suit me better as a place of publication than London. I mean the neighbourhood of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; for towns are a nuisance which I must avoid. If you saw the fog to-day! It is not a vapour but a fluid; as if an Atlantic of Spartan Broth were poured over us, and the men and cattle were converted into tadpoles. Yet after all I am well here; the place still interests and amazes me, the people I find sometimes well informed, more rarely intellectual; but in several cases very kind. I have seen Milton&#x2019;s grave; I made a pilgrimage to Grub-street, took off my hat on entering it, and exclaimed <foreign><hi rend="italic">Salve magna parens</hi></foreign> [Hail great father]!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Georgics</hi>, II, 173. Carlyle ironically pays his respects to Grub Street as the abode of hack-writers, his figurative parents. He also probably had Dr. Johnson in mind (see Boswell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, ed. G. Birkbeck Hill, I, 296, n. 2), who quotes the same Vergilian tag under &#x201C;Lichfield&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> and also quotes under &#x201C;Grub-street&#x201D; a Greek epigram in which Odysseus hails Ithaca, his native land.</note> I is a horror to behold; <foreign>Cuddy</foreign>-lane multiplied by a hundred in all its qualities. I have also a ticket to read in the British Museum, which promises to be of no great use to me. I saw there the <hi rend="italic">original</hi> Magna Charta, with the very seal of King John. I also saw (the Elgin marbles with many others, some months ago; and)&#x2014;Dr Noehden, a hard German pedagogue!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210604-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1821-06-04">4 June 1821</date></ref>.</note> Last night I spent with Procter, a kindly Small; to-night I am to spend with Allan Cunningham at Irving&#x2019;s. I also had a long talk with Thomas Campbell one evening: I found him clever, but not great in intellect; and hard of heart as a Saracen. He was once a young roe of the forest; but now he seems <hi rend="italic">roasted</hi> and made into <hi rend="italic">ham</hi>.</p>
<p>The other afternoon, as I was lying dozing in a brown study after dinner, a lord&#x2019;s lackey knocked at the door and delivered me a little blue parcel, requiring for it a note of delivery. I opened it, and found <pb id="pg-03-226" n="03:226"/>two pretty stitched little books, and a letter from&#x2014;Goethe! I copy it from the <hi rend="italic">fractur</hi> [Gothic script] hand it was written in, and send it for your edification. The patriarchal style of it pleases me much.</p>
<p>[Here follows Carlyle&#x2019;s copy in German of Goethe&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1824-10-30">30 Oct. 1824</date>.]<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Norton for the German text of Goethe&#x2019;s letter. His translation is as follows (<hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, pp. 4&#x2013;5):
<p>&#x201C;If I did not, my dear Sir, promptly inform you of the safe arrival of your welcome present, the reason was, that I had not the intention of writing a mere acknowledgment, but of adding thereto some deliberate words concerning your work which does me such honour. My advanced years, continually burdened with many indispensable duties, have, however, prevented me from leisurely comparing your translation with the original; which might perhaps prove a harder task for me than for some third person thoroughly at home in German and English Literature. But now, since I have an opportunity of sending the present letter safely to London, by favour of the Lords Bentinck, and at the same time of bringing about an acquaintance agreeable to both parties, I do not delay to express my sincere thanks for your hearty sympathy in my literary work, as well as in the incidents of my life, and to beg earnestly for a continuance of it in the future. Perhaps I shall hereafter come to know much of you. Meanwhile I sent together with this a set of poems, which you can hardly have seen, but which I venture to hope may prove of some interest to you.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With the sincerest good wishes, / Most truly yours, /</salute></closer> <name>J.W.v. Goethe /</name> <place>Weimar</place>, <date when="1824-10-30">30<hi rend="italic">th October</hi> 1824</date>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Goethe&#x2019;s letters to Carlyle were dictated to an amanuensis, usually with only the conclusion and signature in his own hand. The poems sent by Goethe are identified in this note by Carlyle which Norton says was written on a copy of Goethe&#x2019;s letter: &#x201C;The &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Reihe von Gedichten</hi> which I can hardly have seen,&#x2019; are a Court Mask by himself, and a printed copy of verses to him on his last birthday and cure from sickness, by one Meyer.&#x201D; For Lord William Cavendish Bentinck, see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241220-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1824-12-20">20 Dec. 1824</date></ref>, and for his brother Lord George Bentinck (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">1848</date>), see <ref target="volume-03/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2157"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>. Hans Heinrich Meyer (<date when="1760">1760</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832">1832</date>), Swiss painter and art critic, was made professor at Weimar Academy of Design through Goethe&#x2019;s influence.</p></note></p>
<p>This you can translate, and send on to Mainhill. The &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Reihe von Gedichten</hi> [series of poems] which I can scarcely yet have seen,&#x201D; are a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Maskenzug</hi></foreign> (Mask) of his own, and a printed copy of verses to him on his last birthday by one Meyer, a German of some note. On the whole I was not a little interested by this small event: it is something to have any interchange of feeling at all with the greatest man of your age, the venerable Sovereign of Parnassus. Poor old fellow! &#x201C;Perhaps he will yet hear much of me!&#x201D; It is a very kind prediction.</p>
<p>But for the present, my sweet small-featured Babe, I must leave thee, and go forth to walk.

<salute>Best and Dearest,</salute>
<p>I have been putting off writing from day to day, that I might be able to tell you of the arrival of the parcel; but as I am wearying already to hear from you again, and as you may, possibly, be feeling anxious about <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in the meantime, I will not put off an hour or minute longer. What <hi rend="italic">can</hi> have befallen this precious parcel? I begin to dread it is gone to the bottom of the sea, or somewhere equally beyond my reach. It is really exceedingly tantalizing,&#x2014;the more so, as I had persuaded myself you would have the consideration to send some of your verses in it, which I am dying with impatience to see. The Books I can more easily make up my mind to lose: the greatest pleasure which these could afford me,&#x2014;the pleasure of one more proof of your mindfulness and affection&#x2014; I have already enjoyed in knowing that you sent them. However it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> cast up: perhaps &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">Queen of Love doth watch its way, doth pity me, and will it safe convey here to my bosom</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Carlyle quotes a sonnet by Edward Irving to Jane from which these lines come.</note> Did you ever see Edward Irvings &#x201C;sonnet <hi rend="italic">to a lock of my Lady&#x2019;s hair which reached me thro&#x2019; hair-breadth</hi> &#x2019;scrapes&#x201D;<supplied>[?]</supplied> It is quite Petrarcean (and what is odd) there is not one word of Isabella in it from beginning to end.</p>
<p>So you would have me either come to London forthwith or give up the darling project altogether. Why give it up, pray? seeing it does harm to nobody, and serves to enliven the dullness of my life in the meanwhile<supplied>[&#x2014;]</supplied> &#x201C;Why? because I shall possibly begone when it suits your convenience to come, and in that case I would rather you should stay where you are.&#x201D; <foreign>Eh bien</foreign>! I really cannot go South this week,&#x2014;not even to accomodate you Dear&#x2014;or any week before the month of February; <pb id="pg-03-228" n="03:228"/>for two reasons, first because I have no fancy for a journey in the dead of winter, and secondly because I shall not be quit of my Pupil any sooner. However it is by no means my intention to renounce the project; tho&#x2019; you have done your endeavour to strip it of all poetry, it is still sufficiently attractive to me. There is no intellectual person you say on the Orator&#x2019;s list! Why, what has befallen his acquaintance? Where are all the eminent personages, the very salt of the earth whom you and he told me of? The Johanna Baillie who makes plays and puddings with the same facility and shines alike as a Genius and a Sicknurse, the Mr<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Montague who combines the majestic virtues of a Roman Matron with the meek graces of a Christian Lady of the nineteenth century, &#x201C;who <hi rend="italic">might have been</hi> the Mother of the Gracchi&#x201D; and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">is</hi> the Mother of all excellence,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Two quotations from Irving&#x2019;s letters, according to A.

Discontented mortal that you are! if like me you had lived all your days in a little provincial town, you would know better how to appreciate such good company. Oh no! it is not the fear of being disappoin<supplied>[ted]</supplied> in the people and still less is it the vulgar fear of being ill-accom<supplied>[m]</supplied>odated which disinclines me to this London visit; it is the little dependance which I have on the Orator&#x2019;s and his Wifes feelings towards me. I have ceased to feel offended with his Reverence, but still I cannot forget that he has given me cause of offence; and past experience makes me hesitate about placing my happiness again in his power. Besides I strongly suspect that this invitation proceeds not so much from any present wish, as from the necessity of fulfilling a long engagement. For his Wife, unless she is a very different woman from what I take her to be, she will hardly forgive me for the good I have done her: the recovery of a faithless Lover, I should think, is a benifit for which one woman is not likely to be very grateful to another&#x2014; But, in the name of verbosity, <pb id="pg-03-229" n="03:229"/>what is it to you and me whether Isabella Martin loves or hates me; or whether Isabella&#x2019;s husband is disposed to &#x2018;help me to the uttermost&#x2019; or to leave me to assist myself? Thank Heaven I have &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a heart for either fate</hi>&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Byron&#x2019;s &#x201C;My Boat Is on the Shore,&#x201D; l. 8.</note> I shall see from the Orator&#x2019;s manner of renewing his invitation if he wishes me to come or not, and I will go or stay accordingly&#x2014; Do you say nothing more to him about the matter, and unsay anything which in the imprudence of your heart you may have said.</p>
<p>Which ever way it is settled I dare say I shall outlive anoth<supplied>[er]</supplied> season&#x2014; To be sure I have no society here, at least none that deserves the name, but I have long been learning to do without: and for the rest, my situation at present is far from desperate. I am at <hi rend="italic">Home</hi> my own &#x201C;sweet Home&#x201D;; my head is as well as it is likely to be in this world; and I am setting all my strength to fulfill <hi rend="italic">the dictates of my will and conscience</hi>. The greatest drawback to my comfort at present is Mis<supplied>[s]</supplied> Gilchrist. Teaching I find is not the most amusing thing on earth; in fact with a stupid lump for a pupil it is about the most irksome. I cannot think yet what tempted my Mother to involve me in such a task or me to suffer myself to be involved in it. When the thing was proposed to me, my intellect (I believe) was bewildered by the Highlander&#x2019;s tumbling feats; and that is my only excuse. Can you imagine a more preposterous arrangement? What have we to do with Miss Catherine Gilchrist or M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Dugald Gilchrist or any of the Gilchrist family? Six months ago we did not know of their existence&#x2014; Would to Heaven it had remained an everlasting secret!&#x2014;neither are they particularly destitute, or particularly meritorious that we should take any such lively interest in them; yet here am I day after day spending time and temper upon this Dunderhead of a girl, labouring to reform her boarding-school manners and to enlighten the Cimmerian darkness of her understanding; and the best of it is she seems to think all the while she is doing me a favour by enduring my instructions and advice. Nevertheless I think I should not grudge my pains if I saw they were likely to be attended with any success; but &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">absque ingenio labor inutilis</hi></foreign>&#x2019; [without ability labor is vain] and my pupil has no genius for any thing beyond flowering muslin. I may explain and repeat and lecture and scold as long as I have lungs left, but it is all to no purpose. Her mind is like the pitchers of the Danaides it lets out faster than I can put any thing into it<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The daughters of Danaus, King of Argos, were condemned in Hades to try forever to fill with water a jar with holes in the bottom.</note>&#x2014; However with all its drawbacks <pb id="pg-03-230" n="03:230"/>this Governess-ship of mine has <hi rend="italic">some</hi> advantages. In the first place it makes it impossible for me to study to excess, which I am somewhat apt to do when I study at all,&#x2014;and overstraining you have told me, and I really believe, is the reason that I so often relax. My pupils Music and drawing and French and Italian lessons fill up so large a portion of my time that I have only four hours a day at my own disposal&#x2014; Secondly it affords me a pretext for living by rule. I can now without fear of disobliging my Mother, follow out a plan of regular occupation in defiance of Callers and all such impertinent interruptions: she cannot with a good grace take offence at my regularity, seeing that it is essential to a faithful discharge of the office she herself has imposed upon me. And lastly it helps to keep me in good humour with myself. my abilities mean as they are, are so gre<supplied>[a]</supplied>tly above Miss Gilchrists, that when I compare myself with her, which I have perpetual occasion to do, I cannot help entertaining a sort of self satisfaction, which in some degree counterbalances the humiliation I feel on comparing myself with you or anybody of real Genius.</p>
<p>Now, will you still dare to maintain that I am not a philosopher? I question if you yourself M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Socrates could have found as much matter of consolation in so trying a predicament? There is one thing which I am heartily glad at&#x2014;contrary to my expectations I have had no further molestation from the Dugald Cratur;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane echoes <hi rend="italic">Rob Roy</hi> (<date when="1818">1818</date> ed., III, 61 ff.), where Dougal Gregor is called the &#x201C;Dougal Creature.&#x201D;</note> except that he is ever and anon sending me books which I never read, and letters which I never answer. I fancy my behaviour at our meeting in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> did not hold out much encouragement to him to try a visit yet I believe all the contemptuousness of manner I am mistress of could hardly have daunted his modest assurance if my Mother had only given him an invitation. But, luckily for me, the Gilchrists are already exfavorites&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">amiable</hi> Dugald has grown somewhat overfat during his sojourn in the North&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> I believe is <hi rend="italic">his</hi> crime&#x2014;at least his embonpoint is the only change I see in him&#x2014;and as for the <hi rend="italic">amiable</hi> Catherine, on better acquaintance she is found to be not amiable at all. She is good humoured indeed:&#x2014;imperturbably goodhumoured but that is the sum total of her virtues; for the rest, she is mean, cunning disgustingly greedy, ungrateful insensible stupid and (what is most intolerable of all) she is downright rude to Shandy; in short she no longer finds favour in my Mothers sight. But what is tempting me to cram my paper with such very uninteresting matters, uninteresting at least to <pb id="pg-03-231" n="03:231"/>you. Fortunately you are very good to me and will not <hi rend="italic">yawn much</hi> at an<supplied>[y]</supplied>thing that touches my comfort.

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>These Booksellers are certainly a consequence of the Fall of Adam; they were sent into the world for our sins. I expected ere this to have been cherishing myself with your answer to my letter; you are unpleasantly awaiting the arrival of the promised parcel; and I must keep my patience for another week and a half. Rascally, drivelling twofooted-things that they are! Three weeks ago I hurried off the packet in the greatest haste; Jack writes that it has not come; I go to ask about it; and find it&#x2014;quietly reposing on its shelf in Fleet-street! They were sorry; they had not understood; they were <hi rend="italic">very</hi> sorry&#x2014; So I brought it home with me, and here it lies expecting some more trustworthy conveyance. By good luck I have got a Council-office frank; and I hope this letter will reach you on Friday-night. The rest will follow in due season; there was nothing but a sorry copy of Moli&#xE8;re&#x2019;s plays, which I got for you in Paris; they may come as slowly as they like. But do not, I pray you, delay to write, the moment you get this, if you have not already written: I am immeasurably anxious to hear from you. A whole month has passed without a word.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-232" n="03:232"/>In the aspect of my own affairs there is scarcely any change since I wrote last. The printing of <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> proceeds with somewhat less tardiness than I dreaded: to-day I got the seventh sheet; so that almost a third part of the work is already off my hands. It is going to make a handsome enough sort of Book; rather larger than a volume of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, and somewhat in the same style. A certain Mr <hi rend="italic">Bull</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Bull, not to be confused with the journal referred to below.</note> one of Irving&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">geniuses</hi>, is engraving a portrait for it. I long to have the pitiful affair put past me, that I may be able to quit the tumults of the <hi rend="italic">Wen</hi> (so Cobbett calls it), and establish myself somewhere more to my wishes and wants. My future movements are still as undecided as ever; only here I ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be, longer than I cannot help it. If there be sleep and quiet and free air to be had on Earth, I will have them; if the<supplied>[re]</supplied> are not I will reconcile myself the best way I can to do without them; but not till I have found that they are not. The Translation of Schiller has made no advances towards being realized: indeed the first letter I had written on the subject, I find still lying among these unhappy books, and only send it off with this. Patience! Patience! A little time will settle all. If I can get no suitable arrangement made for this, I will abandon it, and take to something better. The very sparrow earns for itself a livelihood, beneath the eaves of the cottage: if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> the illustrious Mr Thomas Carlyle cannot, then let me be sent to the Australasian continent directly. Faint-hearted mortal! These scribblers round thee are a mere <foreign><hi rend="italic">canaille</hi></foreign>: struggle thro&#x2019; ten thousand of them, or go to pot&#x2014;as thou deservest.</p>
<p>Irving advises me to stay in London; partly with a friendly feeling, partly with a half selfish one, for he would fain keep me near him. Among all his followers there is none whose intercourse can satisfy him; any other than him it would go far to disgust. Great part of them are blockheads, a few are fools; there is no rightly intellectual man among them. Then he speculates and speculates; and would rather have one contradict him rationally, at least now and then he would, than gape at him with the vacant stare of children viewing &#x201C;the Grand Turk&#x2019;s Palace with his guards&#x2014;all alive.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably one of the &#x201C;panoramas&#x201D; being displayed at the time.</note> He advises me not knowing what he says. He himself has the nerves of a buffalo; and forgets that I have not. His philosophy with me is like a gill of ditch-water thrown into the crater of Mount &#xc6;tna; a million gallons of it would avail me nothing. I receive his nostrums with a smile: he at length despairs of ever seeing me converted.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-233" n="03:233"/>On the whole, however, he is among the best fellows in London; by far the best that I have met with. Thomas Campbell has a far clearer judgement, infinitely more taste and refinement; but there is no living well of thought or feeling in him; his head is a shop not a manufactory; and for his heart, it is dry as a Greenock <hi rend="italic">kipper</hi>. I saw him for the second time, the other night; I viewed him more clearly and in a kindlier light, but scarcely altered my opinion of him. He is not so much a man, as the Editor of a Magazine: his life is that of an exotic; he exists in London, as most Scotchmen do, like a shrub disrooted, and stuck into a bottle of water. Poor Campbell! There were good things in him too: but Fate has pressed too heavy on him, or he has resisted it too weakly. His poetic vein is failing or run out; he has a Port-Glasgow wife, and their only son is in a state of idiocy.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Telford Campbell (b. <date when="1804">1804</date>) began to show symptoms of melancholia in <date when="1821">1821</date> and was confined to an asylum the next year.</note> I sympathized with him; I could have loved him, but he has forgot the way to love.&#x2014; Little Procter here has set up house on the strength of his writing faculties, with his wife a daughter of the &#x201C;Noble Lady.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu.</note> He is a good-natured man, lively and ingenious; but essentially a Small.&#x2014; Coleridge is sunk inextricably in the depths of putrescent indolence. Southey and Wordsworth have retired far from the din of this monstrous city. So has Thomas Moore. Whom have we left? The dwarf Opium-Eater (my Critic in the London Magazine) lives here in lodgings, with a wife and children living or starving on the scanty produce of his scribble, far off in Westmoreland. He carries a laudanum bottle in his pocket; and the venom of a wasp in his heart. Allan Cunningham has cut him, men generally have cut him; a rascal Maghean (or Ma<hi rend="italic">gin</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Maginn (<date when="1793">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842">1842</date>), Irish journalist and poet, contributor to <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>; with Hugh Fraser he founded <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> in <date when="1830">1830</date>.

Filthiest and basest of the children of men! My soul come not into your secrets, mine honour be not united unto you!</p>
<p>Good Heavens! I often inwardly exclaim, and is <hi rend="italic">this</hi> the Literary World? This rascal rout, this dirty rabble, destitute not only of high feeling or knowledge or intellect, but even of common honesty? The very best of them are ill-natured weaklings: they are not red-blooded <hi rend="italic">men</hi> at all; they are only <hi rend="italic">things</hi> for writing &#x201C;articles.&#x201D; But I have done with them for once. In railing at them, let me not forget that if they are bad and worthless, I as yet am <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>; and that he who putteth on his harness should not boast himself as he that putteth it off.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Kings 20:11.</note> Unhappy souls! perhaps they are more to be pitied than blamed: I do not hate them; I would only that stone-walls and iron-bars were constantly between us.</p>
<p>Such is the &#x201C;Literary world&#x201D; of London; indisputably the poorest part of its population at present. Among the other classes of the people, I have met with several whom I like considerably, and whose company still continues to afford me pleasure. The Montagues I see perhaps once a-week: the husband is a wiseacre, with an obliging heart; the lady has the most cultivated taste (in pictures, and players, and attitudes and forms) of any person I remember; in her own sphere of observation, she is quick-sighted as a lynx; she delights to be among geniuses and lions, and <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a touch of kindness for one in her heart, <pb id="pg-03-235" n="03:235"/>tho&#x2019; she shows it very much as if it were <hi rend="italic">all</hi> counterfeit. You may draw on her for any quantity of <hi rend="italic">flattery</hi> you like, and of any degree of fineness. Irving she treats with it by the hogshead; me by the dram-glass, in a stolen way, having almost turned my stomach with excessive doses of it at first. If there is an eccentric virtuoso, a crack-brained philosopher in London, you will hear of him at that house; a man of true sense is a <hi rend="italic">specie</hi> whom I have scarcely ever met with there. Yet they are kind and good, and as the world goes very superior people: I talk with them in a careless, far-off, superficial way, for an hour or two with great ease and enjoyment of its kind. The Stracheys are a better tho&#x2019; less speculative family: I <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> the lady had been possessed of any philosophy or true culture; I should have admired and loved her much, for she is in truth a noble-minded woman tho&#x2019; a methodist in religion,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Actually Mrs. Strachey was a member of the Evangelical &#x201C;Clapham Sect&#x201D; of the Anglican Church, which included Hannah More (<date when="1745">1745</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833">1833</date>) and the great agriculturalist Arthur Young (<date when="1741">1741</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820">1820</date>). On <date when="1814-04-13">13 April 1814</date>, Hannah More wrote to William Wilberforce (<date when="1759">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833">1833</date>) (MS: Duke University): &#x201C;If you see Mr. Arthur Young pray tell him that sweet young woman Mrs. Strachey has been here, as he directed, that I find her truly interesting, enlightened, sincere and deeply serious&#x2014; She is only 23 with a family of children&#x2014; Her husband, the Author of <hi rend="italic">Hindu Algebra</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Bija Ganita</hi> (London, <date when="1813">1813</date>)] is a Deist, which breaks her heart. He holds Xtianity in great contempt and forbids her being acquainted with any serious people. I gave her the best advice I could, but I wished for you&#x2014; She has a Sister Wife of Sir J. Lewis [Louis] Capt of a Man of War, who is under the same circumstances, young, handsome, truly pious, but forbidden religious acquaintance. She [&#x2018;Mrs. S.&#x2019; written in above the line] wept the whole time.&#x201D;</note> and full of strange opinions on all kindred subjects. Shame on me if I cannot tolerate <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, however! She knows that I believe no particle of all that, and yet she likes me, and thinks me honest. Strachey is a Utilitarian in head, with an honest unaffected heart. I see them often and like them well.</p>
<p>But I must not kill you with my talk. One little piece of news; and thou shall have a respite. The other twilight, the lackey of one Lord Bentinck<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Lord William Cavendish Bentinck (<date when="1774">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839">1839</date>), first Governor-General of India. See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 169&#x2013;70, and <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241218-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1824-12-18">18 Dec.</date></ref></note> came with a lackey&#x2019;s knock to the door, and delivered me a little blue parcel, requiring for it a receipt under my hand. I opened it somewhat eagerly, and found two small pamphlets with ornamental covers, and&#x2014;a letter from&#x2014;&#x2014;Goethe! Conceive my satisfaction: it was almost like a message from Fairy Land; I could scarcely think that <hi rend="italic">this was</hi> the real hand and signature of that mysterious personage, whose name had floated thro&#x2019; my fancy, like a sort of spell, since boyhood; whose thoughts had come to me in maturer years <pb id="pg-03-236" n="03:236"/>with almost the impressiveness of revelations. But what says the letter? Kind nothings, in a simple patriarchal style, extremely to my taste. I will copy it, for it is in a character that you cannot read; and send it to you with the original, which you are to keep as the most precious of your literary relics. Only the last line and the signature are in Goethe&#x2019;s hand: I understand he <hi rend="italic">constantly</hi> employs an amanuensis. Do you transcribe my copy, and your own translation of it, into the blank leaf of that German paper, before you lay it by; that the same sheet may contain some traces of him whom I most venerate and her whom I most love in this strangest of all possible worlds.</p>
<p>Now, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Liebchen</hi></foreign>, having heard all this from me so patiently, will you tell me when I am to see your own sweet face? Will you come to London and view the wonders of it before I leave it? or shall I find you at Haddington, and we visit this monster of a place at some future day? Why have I not the <hi rend="italic">wishing carpet</hi>, that I might transport myself to your quiet parlour this very moment! It is of the last importance for me at present to know your purposes; my resolutions must to no small extent be regulated by yours: let this among other things excuse the egoism of my late letters. I desire earnestly that you should know me as I feel and am; I desire no less so to know you. Write at least, without reserve! Let us understand each other, if possible: I believe it concerns the happiness of both that we do. My purpose is to make <hi rend="italic">no</hi> farther changes in my situation, after the next entire one, if I can by any means avoid them. I would labour for the sum-total of the future, tho&#x2019; I commenced at nothing, no longer for the day or the year that was passing over me. Am I right or wrong? Will you approve of it and second it? Or will you merely sanction it with contemptuous toleration? Tell me: by the love we bear each other, by your faith in the honesty of my intentions, tell me sincerely! The wish that is dearest to me you know as well as I. Think of this; advise me, decide for me!</p>
<p>I have a million of minor questions, but no room or spirit to ask them at present. God grant that you may be well, as I have all along been trying to convince myself you were! Write in a day, an hour, if you love me. Good night, my Dearest! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ich k&#xfc;sse dich zehntausendmal</hi></foreign> [I kiss thee ten thousand times]. God bless thee, my little girl! <closer><salute>I am ever and wholly thine,</salute></closer></p>

<p>So you will not give me two letters for one if you can help it. Perverse Mortal! you would defraud the revenue rather. <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Schreiben sie andermahl&#x201D;</hi></foreign>! [Write another time!] A most full and satisfactory answer to my close-written sheet! considerately inserted too in the midst of Foreign intelligence; as if I ever looked at the <hi rend="italic">foreign intelligence</hi> of a newspaper in my life! If it had not been for Dugald Gilchrist who reads any thing (or nothing) and wears spectacles besides, I should undoubtedly have curled my hair with your Examiner, without discovering that it contained such interesting news. NB I did not send the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Blatt</hi></foreign> [newspaper or journal] to Mainhill; from motives of economy: in case of the writing being discovered, there would have been two pounds something to pay for it; and it is incomparably easier to pass thro&#x2019; the eye of a needle than to elude the spirit of research of a Country-postoffice.</p>
<p>Thank you, Dearest, for all the contents of the packet, and in an especial manner for your own delightful, long letter. The Autographs, you have sent me, have all of them a value in my curiosity-loving eyes; but Byron&#x2019;s handwriting&#x2014;my own Byron&#x2019;s&#x2014;I esteem, not as a <hi rend="italic">curiosity</hi> merely, but rather as a relic of an honoured and beloved Friend. Will you believe it? it is more precious to me than even Goethe&#x2019;s letter; flattering tho&#x2019; it is for you to have received, and for me to be made the Depositary of such a letter from so illustrious a Personage. How <hi rend="italic">could</hi> you part with it? Mercy if the object of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> adoration had written a letter to me, I would not have given it away for a charter of nobility.</p>
<p>I expect to find you grown monstrous vain when we meet. And pray, when will that be? The same Mail which brought the newspaper brought me a letter of <hi rend="italic">fifteen pages</hi> from my Cousin. The time of his marriage, he tells me, is not fixed yet; on the contrary the Ladies relations are exerting themselves to break of<supplied>[f]</supplied> the match: in the mean time he has sold the cream-coloured ponies in his Phaeton, and got a &#x2018;brilliant&#x2019; pair milk-white, with long manes and tails. He entreats, however, that I will come to him in Sussex immediately: he will meet me any where I like between this and London; for the etiquette part of it, there is one of his Sister&#x2019;s keeping house for him; and as to his <pb id="pg-03-238" n="03:238"/>marriage, there is no earthly use in waiting for it, as, if it does take place my presence will be an addition to his happiness, and if it does <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, there is none so able to sooth<supplied>[e]</supplied> and comfort him&#x2014; <foreign>Alle guten Geister</foreign> [All good spirits]&#x2014;&#x2014; Take care of yourself Mademoiselle; to <hi rend="italic">comfort</hi> the handsomest most fascinating young Man in England would unquestionably be a very pleasing task, but are you quite sure it would be a safe one? perhaps you had as well not try. You cannot think what an alarming whirl this letter put my wits in&#x2014;I was quite beside myself for about the space of one hour. In this critical situation I applied to &#x201C;Smith&#x2019;s moral sentiments&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adam Smith (<date when="1732">1732</date>&#x2013;<date when="1790">90</date>), <hi rend="italic">Theory of the Moral Sentiments</hi> (<date when="1759">1759</date>).</note> but the Devil was not to be cast out of me by abstract reasonings. and I was obliged to have recourse to Beethoven&#x2019;s most difficult Sonata, one of my last resources when I am fancy-possessed<supplied>[.]</supplied> In the present instance it worked a miracle in my favour, I rose from the Piano-forte sound in mind, and wrote to my bewitching Cousin that I would not come.&#x2014; There now! am not I a <hi rend="italic">prudent</hi> creature after all? if you knew what a dazzling host of temptations beleagu<supplied>[e]</supplied>red the council-chamber of my thoughts, while the affair was in debate, you would wonder (I am sure) at the magnanimity of this decision.</p>
<p>I am going on in my studying and teaching at an ambling sort of pace. I give my pupil lessons in the morning, which she forgets at night, and in the intervals of this <hi rend="italic">Sisiphian</hi> labour, read history and German. My plan is as good a one as the circumstances admit of. I am resolved to adhere to it inflexibly while Miss Gilchrist is here, and to improve upon it when the Lord is pleased to remove her&#x2014; There is another resolution I have made which I know you will approve&#x2014;to finish in some way every thing I begin. My taste has so far outstripped my other faculties that I get disgusted with all my performances at the very outset; and for want of motives strong enough to <hi rend="italic">force</hi> me to persevere, I have got into a habit of flying from one thing to another always flattering myself with the hope of succeeding better. I perceive the pernicious effects of this, not only in the sad reflection how much of my life has been already wasted in profitless attempts; but likewise in the fainthea<supplied>[rted]</supplied>ness with which I enter on every new undertaking, and which is enough of itself to preclude all chance of success &#x2014; <foreign>Languescet industria si nulla ex se spes</foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Where there is no hope, industry grows feeble.&#x201D; Loosely adapted from Tacitus, <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi>, II, 38.</note>&#x2014;I have determined then, to get the better of this mental malady; and <hi rend="italic">will</hi> tho it should prove <pb id="pg-03-239" n="03:239"/>as inveterate as the ring-worm. My first operations to this effect have been vigorous and successful. I instituted an inquisitorial visit to my writing-desk&#x2014;and&#x2014;condemned to the flames every unfinished Manuscript which might serve as an evil precedent. in this way perished the first scene of one tragedy, and the outline of another together with the beginnings of <hi rend="italic">five</hi> novels in various stages of progress. From the pure Spirit of burning I closed the <foreign>auto de fe</foreign><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Announcement of judgment in the Spanish Inquisition, usually followed by burning the heretic.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Your letter came to me the day before Christmas; it is time that it were answered. I am much obliged to you for your punctuality; a virtue which in my situation, I am called upon to rival or even to surpass. I have no news for you; only harmless chat; but that, and the assurance that there is no <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> news will repay you for the charge of postage. The creature M&#x2019;Diarmid<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>.</note> after frightening our Mother has almost begun to frighten me. His tidings of maladies and deaths in your quarter wear an alarming aspect: I long to be assured that those dear to me continue to be mercifully spared from such visitations. You will not fail to write the very first moment you can spare.</p>
<p>Every thing goes on with me here very much as it was doing when I wrote last. My health is not worse, nor do my spirits fail. I feel <hi rend="italic">determined</hi> to regain a sound state of body, at whatever cost; to remodel my whole manner of proceeding, and at length to begin living as a reasonable man in my circumstances ought. There is no want of resources in my fortune: it only behoves me to apply them wisely, and resolutely to abide by my determinations with regard to them. I think I have well nigh decided on returning to Scotland, when this Book is off my hands. This tumultuous capital is not the place for one like me. The very expense of it were almost enough to drive me out of it: I cannot live in the simplest style under about two guineas a week; a sum that would suffice to keep a decent roof of my own above me in my Fatherland. Besides I ought to settle somewhere, and get a home and neighbourhood among my fellow creatures. Now this London, to my mind, is not a flattering scene for such an enterprise. One hates, for one thing, to be a <hi rend="italic">foreigner</hi> anywhere; and this after all that can be said about it, is the case with <hi rend="italic">every</hi> Scotchman in this city. They live as aliens here, unrooted in the soil; without political, religious, or even much social, interest in the community; distinctly feeling every day that with them it is money only that can &#x201C;make the mare to go.&#x201D; Hence Cash! cash! cash! is the everlasting cry of their souls. They are consequently very &#x201C;hard characters&#x201D;; they believe in nothing but their ledgers; their precept is like that of Iago. &#x201C;Put money in your purse&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230509-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1823-05-09">9 May 1823</date></ref>.</note> <pb id="pg-03-241" n="03:241"/>or as he of Burnfoot<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Burnfoot is an estate one mile east of Ecclefechan.</note> more emphatically expressed it, &#x201C;Now Jock! Get Siller; honestly, if thou can; but ony way, <hi rend="italic">get</hi> it!&#x201D; I should like but indifferently to be ranked among them; for my sentiments and theirs are not at all germane. The first <hi rend="italic">improvement</hi> they make upon themselves in the South is to acquire the habit of sneering at their honest old country; vending many stale jokes about its poverty, and the happiness of travelling with one&#x2019;s face <hi rend="italic">towards</hi> the sun. This is a &#x201C;damnable&#x201D; heresy, as honest Allan Cunningham called it. I have no patience with the leaden-hearted dogs. Often when appealed to that I might confirm such shallow sarcasms, I have risen in my wrath, and branded them with my bitterest contempt&#x2014; But here they are staple speculation with our degenerate compatriots. <hi rend="italic">Bull</hi> [underscored twice] himself, again, tho&#x2019; a frank, beef-loving, joyous kind of person, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> excessively stupid: take him out of the sphere of the <hi rend="italic">five senses</hi>, and he gazes with a vacant astonishment, wondering &#x201C;what the devil the fellow <hi rend="italic">can</hi> mean.&#x201D; This is comparatively the state of all ranks, so far as I have seen them, from the highest to the lowest; but especially of the latter. Of these it is unspeakably so! Yesterday I went to see Newgate, under the auspices of the benevolent Mrs Fry,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Fry (<date when="1780">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845">1845</date>), Quaker prison reformer, by <date when="1825">1825</date> had greatly improved the condition of women prisoners in Newgate and had arranged for the employment and housing of transported criminals on arrival in New South Wales. In her travels round the country she combined preaching with prison visiting and was instrumental in starting ladies&#x2019; committees for reform. See Thomas Hood, &#x201C;A <hi rend="italic">Friendly</hi> Address to Mrs. Fry <hi rend="italic">in</hi> Newgate&#x201D; (<date when="1825">1825</date>).</note> a Quaker lady who every Friday goes on her errand of mercy to inspect the condition of the female prisoners. She, this good Quakeress, is as much like an angel of Peace as any person I ever saw: she read a chapter, and <hi rend="italic">expounded</hi> it, to the most degraded audience of the universe, in a style of beautiful simplicity which I shall not soon forget. But oh! the male felons! The two hundred polluted wretches, thro&#x2019; whose stalls and yards I was next carried! There were they of all climates and kinds, the Jew the Turk the &#x2018;Christian&#x2019;; from the grey villain of sixty to the blackguard boy of <hi rend="italic">eight</hi>! Nor was it their depravity that struck me, so much as their debasement. Most of them actually looked like <hi rend="italic">animals</hi>; you could see no traces of a <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> (not even of a bad one) in their gloating, callous, sensual countenances; they had never <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> at all, they had only eaten and drunk and made merry. I have seen as wicked people in the north; but it was another and far less abominable sort of wickedness. A Scotch blackguard is very generally a thinking reasoning person; some theory and principle of life, a Satanic philosophy, beams <pb id="pg-03-242" n="03:242"/>from every feature of his rugged scowling countenance. Not so here. The sharpness of these people was the cunning of a fox, their stubbornness was the sullen gloom of a mastiff. Newgate holds, I believe, within its walls, more human baseness than any other spot in the Creation.</p>
<p>But why do I write of it or aught connected with it, since in a few weeks I hope to tell you every thing by word of mouth? We are on the fifteenth sheet of <hi rend="italic">Schiller; six</hi> more will set us thro&#x2019; it. The moment it is finished, I purpose to decamp. I have given the creatures <hi rend="italic">four</hi> weeks (they engage for three) to settle every thing: I should not be surprised if you met me at the Candlemas Fair on the plain stones of Dumfries! Soon after the beginning of February I do expect to see old, meagre, but true-hearted Annandale again. No doubt, you will have the <hi rend="italic">wark-gear afoot</hi>, that is, the pony in riding order, and every thing in readiness for me. When arrived, my purposes are various, and inviting tho&#x2019; unsettled. I have written to Edinburgh about a projected Translation of <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x2019;s Works</hi>; Brewster sends me word that Blackwood (the bookseller) &#x201C;has no doubt he will be able to engage with me, in Schiller (which, however, he does not seem to relish) or in some other literary object.&#x201D; Blackwood, I believe, is but a knave; and I put no faith in him. Nay since I began to write this sentence, I have a letter from the scoundrel Boyd &#x201C;respectfully declining&#x201D; to engage in that speculation of Schiller!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Blackwood (<date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834">1834</date>), publisher and founder of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Monthly Magazine</hi> (<date when="1817">1817</date>), which became <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi>. See <ref target="volume-03/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2550"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>. Carlyle&#x2019;s letter to Boyd proposing the translation, <date when="1825-01-01">1 Jan. 1825</date>, is printed at the end of Vol. IV.</note> So that I rather suppose <hi rend="italic">it</hi> must be renounced. No matter! There are plenty more, where it came from! I am bent on <hi rend="italic">farming</hi>, for the recovery of my health; nay &#x201C;Marriage&#x201D; itself is sometimes not out of my ulterior contemplations! But I will explain all things when we meet.</p>
<p>The Bullers are living at Shooters&#x2019; Hill: their boys are not prospering u<supplied>[nder the]</supplied> present arrangement. thro&#x2019; Mrs Strachey, they made me a kind of offer about taking <supplied>[Arth]</supplied>ur under my management here, and letting him live with me, at the rate of &#xa3;200 a-year, till next october. This I &#x201C;respectfully declined&#x201D;; the board alone of the boy would be &#xa3;150; and &#xa3;200 more were but a reasonable compensation for the trouble of him. If they choose to send him with me into Scotland at the rate of &#xa3;300 per annum, I may listen to their proposal: but this I hardly expect; nor do I greatly care about it.</p>
<p>But the day is breaking up into fair sunshine; and I must out to take the benefit of it. Let me have a letter from you, a long one, and a <pb id="pg-03-243" n="03:243"/>good one like the last, by the very earliest opportunity. Thank my kind true Mother for her note: tell her it will not be long till I answer all her queries by word of mouth. In the mean time, I have a message for her, which I know will please her well, because it is to <hi rend="italic">do something for me</hi>. Badams prescribes <hi rend="italic">warmth</hi> above all things: he made me wear close stocking (flannel or rather woolen) drawers even in summer. My Mother once offered to get Peter Little to work me such a pair: tell her that now if she has any wool, I will take them. If she has not, she need never mind in the least: we can settle it&#x2014;when&#x2014;we meet!&#x2014; Do you regularly hear of Jack? He is a letter in my debt for ten days. But I hope the good soul is well. Does he send you the Examiner? Has he written you a translation of Goethe&#x2019;s letter to me? I was very glad to hear from the old blade, in so kind tho&#x2019; so brief a fashion. I mean to send him a copy of <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x2019;s Life</hi>, so soon as it is ready.</p>
<p>Now, my dear Boy, I must take my flight. I have purchased me a small seal and the Carlyles&#x2019; crest with <hi rend="italic">Humilitate</hi> and all the rest of it are engraving on it. The thing lies at present in Oxford-street, and was to be ready about this time to-day. I am going thither: if I get it, I will seal this letter with it, for your edification. Write directly, and tell me all; the progress of the <hi rend="italic">Gheen</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The sister of &#x201C;Old Laird Millar&#x201D; of Annandale.

The smallest incident from that quarter recorded in your pithy style is valuable to me.</p>
<p>Irving and I are as friendly as ever. He is toiling in the midst of many difficulties and tasks, internal and external, domestic and ecclesiastic. I wish him well thro&#x2019; them! He is the best man I have met in England. But here as I told him lately he has no home; he is a &#x2018;missionary&#x2019; rather than a pastor.&#x2014; My Father has never written to me: I should like much to see his hand in London. Give my warmest love to him and Mother, and all the <hi rend="italic">brethren</hi> &#x26; sisters, beginning with Mag and ending with Jenny. Write soon good Alick! <closer><salute>I am ever your true Brother,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I trust that the same cheerful spirit of affection, which breathes in every line of your last charming letter, still animates you, and disposes <pb id="pg-03-244" n="03:244"/>you kindly towards me. I have somewhat to propose to you; which it may require all your love of me to make you look upon with favour. If you are not the best woman in this world, it may prove a sorry business for both of us.</p>
<p>You bid me tell you how I have decided; what I mean to do. My Dearest! it is you that must decide: I will endeavour to explain to you what I wish; it must rest with you to say whether it can ever be attained. You tell me, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">you</hi> have land which needs improvement: why not work on <hi rend="italic">that</hi>?&#x201D; In one word, then: Will you go with me, will you be my own forever; and I embrace the project with my whole heart? Say, Yes! And I send my Brother Alick over to rent that Nithsdale farm for me without delay; I proceed to it, the moment I am freed from my engagements here; I labour in arranging it, and fitting every thing for your reception; and the instant it is ready, I take you home to my hearth and my bosom, never more to part from me whatever fate betide us!</p>
<p>I fear you think this scheme a baseless vision: and yet it is the sober best, among the many I have meditated; the best for me, and I think also so far as I can judge of it, for yourself. If it take effect and be well conducted, I look upon the recovery of my health and equanimity, and with these, of regular profitable and natural habits of activity, as things which are no longer doubtful. I have lost them, by departing from Nature; I must find them by returning to her. A stern experience has taught me this; and I am a fool if I do not profit by the lesson. Depend on it, Jane, this literature, which both of us are so bent on pursuing, will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> constitute the sole nourishment of any true human spirit. No truth has been forced upon me, after more resistance, or with more invincible impressiveness, than this. I feel it in myself, I see it daily in others. Literature is the <hi rend="italic">wine</hi> of life; it will not, cannot, be its <hi rend="italic">food</hi>. What is it that makes Blue-stockings of women, Magazine-hacks of men? They neglect household and social duties, they have no household and social enjoyments. Life is no longer with them a verdant field, but a <foreign><hi rend="italic">hortus siccus</hi></foreign> [parched garden]; they exist pent up in noisome streets, amid feverish excitements; they despise or overlook the common blessedness which Providence has laid out for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> his creatures, and try to substitute for it a distilled quintessence prepared in the alembic of painters and rhymers and sweet singers. What is the result? This <hi rend="italic">ardent spirit</hi> parches up their nature; they become discontented and despicable, or wretched and dangerous. Byron and all strong souls go the latter way; Campbell and all weak souls the former. <pb id="pg-03-245" n="03:245"/>&#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Hinauf!</hi></foreign>&#x2019; as the Devil says to Faust, &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Hinauf ins freye Feld!</hi></foreign>&#x2019; [&#x201C;Away into the open field!&#x201D;]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Faust in his first long soliloquy, in despair over the barrenness of his academic existence, utters, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Flieh! Auf! Hinaus ins weite Land</hi></foreign>&#x201D; (l. 418). On several occasions Mephistopheles reproaches him for sluggishness, notably at the end of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Nacht. Offen Feld</hi>&#x201D; and of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Kerker</hi>.&#x201D;</note> There is no soul in these rapid &#x2018;articles&#x2019; of yours: away! Be <hi rend="italic">men</hi>, before attempting to be <hi rend="italic">writers</hi>!</p>
<p>You too, my Darling, are unhappy; and I see the reason. You have a deep, earnest, vehement spirit, and no earnest task has ever been assigned it. You despise and ridicule the meanness of the things about you: to the things you honour you can only pay a fervent adoration, which issues in no practical effect. O that I saw you the mistress of a house; diffusing over human souls that loved you those clear faculties of order, judgement, elegance, which you are now reduced to spend on pictures and portfolios; blessing living hearts with that enthusiastic love which you must now direct to the distant and dimly seen! All this is in you, Jane! You have a heart and an intellect and a resolute decision, which might make you the model of wives, however widely your thoughts and your experience have hitherto wandered from that highest destination of even the noblest woman. I too have wandered wide and far! Let us return, my Dearest! Let us return <hi rend="italic">together</hi>! Let us learn thro&#x2019; one another what it is to live; let us become citizens of this world; let us set our minds and habitudes in order, and grow under the peaceful sunshine of Nature, that whatever fruit or flowers have been implanted in our spirits may ripen wholesomely and be distributed in due season! What is genius but the last perfection of true manhood? The pure reflexion of a spirit in union with itself, discharging all common duties with more than common excellence, extracting from the many-coloured scenes of life in which it mingles, the beautifying principle which more or less pervades them all? The rose in its full-blown fragrance is the glory of the fields: but there must be a soil and stem and leaves, or there will be no rose. Your mind and my own <hi rend="italic">have</hi> in them many capabilities; but the first of all their duties is to provide for their own regulation and contentment: if there <hi rend="italic">be</hi> an overplus to consecrate to higher ends, it will not fail to shew itself; if there be none, it is better that it never should attempt to shew itself.</p>
<p>But I must leave these generalities; and avoid romance; for it is an earnest practical affair we are engaged in, and requires sense and calculation, not poetics and enthusiasm. &#x2018;Where then,&#x2019; you ask me, &#x2018;are the <hi rend="italic">means</hi> of realizing these results, of mastering the difficulties and <pb id="pg-03-246" n="03:246"/>deficiencies that beset us both?&#x2019; This too I have considered; the black catalogue of impediments have passed again and again in review before me; but on the whole I do not think them insurmountable. If you will undertake to be my faithful helper, as I will all my life be yours, I fear not to engage with them! The first, the lowest, but a most essential point, is that of funds. On this matter, I have still little to tell you that you do not know. I feel in general that I have ordinary faculties in me, and an ordinary diligence in using them; and that thousands manage life in comfort with even slenderer resources. In my present state my income tho&#x2019; small might to reasonable wishes be sufficient; were my health and faculties restored, it <hi rend="italic">might</hi> become abundant. Shall I confess to you, My Dearest, this is a difficulty, which I imagine we are apt to overrate. The essentials of even elegant comfort are not difficult to procure: it is only vanity that is insatiable in consuming. To my taste, cleanliness and order are far beyond gilding and grandeur, which without them are an abomination: and for displays, for festivals and &#x2018;parties&#x2019; I believe you are as indisposed as myself. Your Mother&#x2019;s house is truly the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> I have ever seen; tho&#x2019; in my travels I have looked at some where <hi rend="italic">thirty</hi> times the money was expended. After all, what is the use of this same vanity? Where is the good of being its slaves? If thou and I love one another, if we discharge our duties faithfully and steadfastly, one labouring with honest manful zeal to provide, the other with noble wife-like prudence in dispensing, have we not done all <hi rend="italic">we can</hi>, are we not acquitted at the bar of our own conscience? And what is it to us, whether this or that Squire or Baillie be richer or poorer than we?</p>
<p>Two laws I have laid down to myself: That I must and will recover health, without which to think or even to live is burdensome or unprofitable; and that I will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> degenerate into the wretched thing which calls itself an Author in our Capitals, and scribbles for the sake of filthy lucre in the periodicals of the day. Thank Heaven! there are other means of living: if there were not, I for one should beg to be excused! My projects I will give you in detail <hi rend="italic">when we meet</hi>. That <hi rend="italic">Translation of Schiller</hi> I think will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> take effect; that of the <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi> has brightened up in me again, and I think <hi rend="italic">will</hi>. Perhaps it is better for me: I ought to thank the timorousness of Bookselle<supplied>[rs]</supplied> for driving me back on it. Failing both, there are other schemes, schemes unconnected with writing altogether. But here is not an inch of space for speaking of them.</p>
<p>On the whole I begin to entertain a certain degree of contempt <pb id="pg-03-247" n="03:247"/>for the Destiny, which has so long persecuted me. I will be a man in spite of it! Yet it lies with you, my Dearest, whether I shall be a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> man, or only a hard bitter stoic. What say you, Jane? Decide for yourself and me! Consent, if you dare trust me! Consent, and come to my faithful breast, and let us live and die together! Yet fear not to deny me, if your judgement so determine. It will be a sharp pang that tears away from me forever the hope, which now for years has been the solace of my existence: but better to endure it and all its consequences, than to witness and to cause the forfeit of your happiness. At times, I confess, when I hear you speak of your gay cousins, and contrast with their brilliant equipments my own simple exterior, and scanty prospects, and humble but to me most dear and honourable-minded kinsmen, whom I were the veriest dog if I ever ceased to love and venerate and cherish for their true affection, and the rugged sterling of their characters; when I think of all this, I could almost counsel you to cast me utterly away, and connect yourself with one whose friends and station were more analogous to your own. But anon in some moment of self-love, I say proudly, There is a spirit in <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, which is worthy of this noble maiden, which shall be worthy of her! I will take her to my heart, care-laden but ever true to her; I will teach her, I will guide her, I will make her happy! Together we will share the joys and sorrows of existence; I will bear her in my arms thro&#x2019; all its vicissitudes, and Fate itself shall not divide us.</p>
<p>Speak, then, my Angel! How say you? Will you be mine, mine? Or am I a fool for having hoped it? Think well; of me, of yourself, of our circumstances; and determine. Or have you not already thought? You love me, do you not? Dare you trust me; dare you trust your fate with me, as I trust mine with you? Say yes! and I see you in February, and take &#x2018;sweet counsel&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;We took sweet counsel together&#x201D; (Ps. 55:14).</note> with you about all our hopes and plans and future life, thenceforward to be one and indivisible. Say no! and&#x2014; But you will not say no, if you can help it; for you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> love me, deny it as you will; and your spirit longs to be mingled with mine, as mine with yours, that we may be <hi rend="italic">one</hi> in the sight of God and man forever and ever!</p>
<p>Now judge if I wait your answer with impatience! I know you will not keep me waiting.&#x2014; Of course it will be necessary to explain all things to your Mother, and take her serious advice respecting them. For your other &#x2018;friends&#x2019; it is not worth consulting one of them. I know not that there is one among them that would give you as disinterested <pb id="pg-03-248" n="03:248"/>an advice as even I, judging in my own cause. <closer><salute>M<supplied>[a]</supplied>y God bless you, and direct you, my Dearest! Decide as you will, I am yours forever,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The printer and I are within <hi rend="italic">four sheets</hi> of the end of <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x2019;s Life</hi>; unless there be some delay in the <hi rend="italic">boarding</hi> (which I now write partly for the purpose of requesting you to forward), the Book will be ready in a few days.

May I beg of you to take some charge of all these matters: I am in greater haste than ever to get out of Town.</p>
<p>Whatever advertising you mean to bestow on <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> may now go on forthwith. Allowing for all accidents (the event of which I know but too well), the <hi rend="italic">first of February</hi> might with confidence be announced as the day of publication. I think the Title ought to be: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Life of Friedrich Schiller, Comprehending an Examination of his Works</hi>,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This was the title used. When the work was published in the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi> earlier, the title had been &#x201C;Schiller&#x2019;s Life and Writings.&#x201D;</note> and nothing farther. It looks more modest, and is still sufficiently descriptive. In the newspapers if you think it profitable, you are entitled farther to say that it includes &#x201C;extracts from his writings and notices of his contemporaries&#x201D;: but the very shadow of a puff is a thing I would have avoided.</p>
<p>On the whole, the poor little Book pleases me better now than it did. I think it cannot fail of selling, extensively enough to bring you handsomely out of the concern, provided the public are once made aware of its existence.</p>
<p>Mr Richards<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The printer. His name and address are given in the first edition: &#x201C;C. Richards, Printer, 100, St. Martin&#x2019;s-lane, Charing Cross.&#x201D;</note> has on the whole behaved like &#x201C;a man of honour&#x201D;: my sole request now is that there be no delay in other quarters.</p>
<p>I mean some day to come over and see you; tho&#x2019; you live at a distance truly frightful.</p>

<salute>My dearest Friend</salute>
<p>I little thought that my joke about farming Craigenputtock was to be made the basis of such a serious and extraordinary project. If you had foreseen the state of perplexity which your letter has thrown me into you would have practised <hi rend="italic">any</hi> self-denial (I am sure) rather than have written it. But there is no use in talking of what is <hi rend="italic">done</hi>&#x2014; &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">cosa fatta ha capo</hi></foreign>!&#x201D; [&#x201C;A deed is crowned when done&#x201D;]!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250103-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1825-01-03">3 Jan.</date></ref></note> The thing to be considered now is what <hi rend="italic">to do</hi>.</p>
<p>You have sometimes asked me, did I ever think. For once in my life, at least, I have thought myself into a vertigo, and without coming to any positive conclusion<supplied>[.]</supplied> However&#x2014;my mind (such as it is) on the matter you have, thus precipitately, forced on my consideration, I will explain to you, frankly and explicitly, as the happiness of us both requires.</p>
<p>I love you&#x2014; I have told you so a hundred times; and I should be the most ungrateful, and injudicious of mortals if I did not&#x2014;but I am not <hi rend="italic">in love</hi> with you&#x2014;that is to say&#x2014;my love for you is not a passion which overclouds my judgement; and absorbs all my regards for myself and others&#x2014;it is a simple, honest, serene affection, made up of admiration and sympathy, and better perhaps, to found domestic enjoyment on than any other&#x2014; In short it is a love which <hi rend="italic">influences</hi>, does not <hi rend="italic">make</hi> the destiny of a life.</p>
<p>Such temperate sentiments lend no false colouring no &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">rosy light</hi>&#x201D;to your project. I see it such as it is, with all the arguments for and against it; I see that my consent under existing circumstances would indeed secure to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the only fellowship and support I have found in the world; and perhaps, too, shed some sunshine of joy on <hi rend="italic">your</hi> existence which has hitherto been sullen and cheerless; but, on the other hand, that it would involve you and myself in numberless cares and difficulties; and expose <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to petty tribulations, which I want fortitude to despise, and which, not despised, would imbitter the peace of us both</p>
<p>I do not wish for fortune more than is sufficient for my wants&#x2014;my natural wants, and the artificial ones which habit has rendered nearly as importunate as the other&#x2014;but I will not marry to live on less; because <pb id="pg-03-250" n="03:250"/>in that case every inconvenience I was subjected to, would remind me of what I had quitted; and the idea of a sacrifice should have no place in a voluntary union&#x2014; Neither have I any wish for grandeur&#x2014;the glittering baits of titles and honours are only for children and fools &#x2014; But I conceive it a duty which every one owes to society, not to throw up that station in it which Providence has assigned him; and having this conviction, I could not marry into a station inferior to my own with the approval of my judgement, <hi rend="italic">which</hi> alone could enable me to brave the censures of my acquaintance.</p>
<p>And now let me ask you have you any <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> livelihood to ma<supplied>[i]</supplied>ntain me in the manner I have been used to live in? any <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> place in the rank of society I have <supplied>[been]</supplied> born and bred in? No! You have projects for attaining both&#x2014;capabilities for attaining both&#x2014;and much more! but as yet you have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> attained them. Use the noble gifts which God has given you! You have prudence (tho&#x2019; by the way this last proceeding is no great proof of it)&#x2014;devise then how you may gain yourself a moderate but <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> income; think of some more promising plan, than farming the most barren spot in the county of Dumfries-shire&#x2014; What a thing that would be to be sure! you and I keeping house at Craigenputtock! I would just as soon think of building myself a nest on the Bass-rock<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A large barren rock off the coast of East Lothian, now a bird sanctuary.</note>&#x2014;nothing but your ignorance of the place saves you from the imputation of insanity for admitting such a thought. Depend upon it, you could not <hi rend="italic">exist</hi> there a twelvemonth. For my part I would not spend a month on it with an Angel&#x2014; Think of something else then&#x2014;apply your industry to carry it into exffect[<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>,] your talents to glid over the inequality of our births and then&#x2014;we will talk of marrying. If all this were realized I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> I should have goodsense enough to abate something of my romantic ideal, and to content myself with stopping short on this side idolatry&#x2014; At all events I will marry no one else&#x2014; This is all the promise I can or will make. A positive engagement to marry a certain person at a certain time, at all haps and hazards<supplied>[,]</supplied> I have always considered the most rediculous thing on earth: it is either altogether useless or altogether miserable; if the parties continue faithfully attached to each other it is a mere ceremony&#x2014;if otherwise it becomes a galling fetter reviting [riveting] them to wretchedness and only to be broken with disgrace.</p>
<p>Such is the result of my deliberations on this very serious subject<supplied>[.]</supplied> You may approve of it or not; but you cannot either persuade me or convince me out of it&#x2014; My decisions&#x2014;when I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> decide<supplied>[&#x2014;]</supplied> are unalterable <pb id="pg-03-251" n="03:251"/>as the laws of the Medes &#x26; Persians&#x2014; Write instantly and tell me that you are content to leave the event to time and destiny&#x2014;and in the meanwhile to continue my Friend and Guardian which you have so long and so faithfully been&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">and nothing more</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>It would be more agreeable to etiquette, and perhaps also to prudence, that I should adopt no middle course in an affair such as this&#x2014;that I should not for another instant encourage an affection I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> never reward and a hope I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> never fulfil; but cast your heart away from me at once since I cannot embrace the resolution which would give me a right to it for ever. This I would assuredly do if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were like the generality of lovers, or if it were still in my power to be happy independent of your affection but as it <supplied>[is]</supplied> neither etiquette nor prudence can obtain this of me.

<salute>Amiable Cousin</salute>
<p>I said to myself, weeks ago, that I would write to you with the books: now then the books are finished; and here I am writing. I might, perhaps, have been tempted to anticipate my purpose, if I had had any thing worthwhile to communicate; but my history, since we parted has been uninteresting, to the last degree; and it would only have been <hi rend="italic">ennuying</hi> you to send you any fragments of it.</p>
<p>From this you may conclude that I have been rather happy as otherwise. If I have had no cause of rejoicing, neither have I had any of complaint: my little universe has been at rest from all sorts of commotion; has been &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">calm and unruffled as a summer&#x2019;s sea, when not a breath of wind flies o&#x2019;er its surface</hi>&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Addison&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi>, I, iv, 122&#x2013;23.</note> or as a summer&#x2019;s quagmire, to use a more appropriate simile&#x2014; The only event, which has jarred the <pb id="pg-03-252" n="03:252"/>music of my soul, for any length of time, was a visit from Dugald Gilchrist, a most impudent and improper visit, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all the circumstances of the case considered</hi>&#x201D; (as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Anderson would say)<supplied>[.]</supplied> He came uninvited, and staid a week, stomaching the most <foreign><hi rend="italic">du haut en bas</hi></foreign> [condescending] treatment from me all the while: one would have thought that even the patience of an Indian must have rebelled under it&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Dugald <hi rend="italic">creatur</hi> belongs to the Spaniel genus (I opine); the more he is kicked about, the more he fawns and cringes. I told him, among other things, in tolerably plain English that he was given to lying! (and good reason I had for saying so) in reply, he kissed my hand! <hi rend="italic">This</hi> was obeying the scriptures with a vengeance! If I had bid him get out at the door, I suppose, he would have taken me in his arms. Drivelling, meanspirited, &#x201C;thrice doubled Ass&#x201D;! He is sunk immeasurable fathoms, deep, in my disdain!&#x2014; &#x201C;<foreign>Mais doucement</foreign>! [But softly] Mademoiselle! there is no use of putting yourself in a passion&#x2014; The young gentleman <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a moon-calf&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> nobody will deny you&#x2014;but he is at present sixteen miles off, and not likely to disturb your equanimity again&#x201D;&#x2014;<foreign>c&#x2019;est bien</foreign>!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the most pleasurable thing, which has befallen me, was receiving <hi rend="italic">two</hi> packets, from England, in the same night: the one a letter of <hi rend="italic">fifteen pages</hi> from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baillie; the other a collection of Autographs from his Opposite. What do you think? among these were a letter from Goethe, and a fragment of a letter from Byron! Goethe&#x2019;s was written to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle himself&#x2014;it is highly complimentary; and coming from the man whom he honours, almost to idolatry, must have gratified him beyond measure&#x2014; I question if a charter of nobility could have gratified him as much. The other was given him by Proctor (Barry Cornwal<supplied>[l]</supplied>). You cannot think how it affected me! This, then, was <hi rend="italic">his</hi> handwriting! <hi rend="italic">his</hi> whose image had haunted my imagination, for years and years; whose wild, glorious Spirit had tinctured all the poetry of my Being! <hi rend="italic">he</hi>, then, had seen and touched this very paper,&#x2014;I could almost fancy that his look and touch were visible on it, And <hi rend="italic">he</hi>&#x2014;where was he now? All the sentiment in me was screwed up to the highest pitch; I could hardly help crying like a child or Dugald Gilchrist; and I kissed the seal with a fervour which would would [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] have graced the most passionate Lover<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edinburgh University possesses the manuscript of the following poem &#x201C;To Byron,&#x201D; composed by Jane Welsh at the age of fifteen:
<lg><l>Still my loved Minstrel I admire</l>
<l>The strains of thy enchanted lyre</l>
<l>Still thy sad lays so wildly sweet</l>
<l>I read&#x2014;and while I read I weep</l>
<l>Nor do I check the burning tear</l>
<l>For &#x2019;tis a silent tribute dear</l>
<l>To souls like thine which would inspire</l>
<l>Each breast with sympathetic fire</l>
<l>Byron thy noble lofty mind</l>
<l>Has been the sport of passions blind</l>
<l>Phrenzy has havocked in thy brain</l>
<l>With all her desolating train</l>
<l>But that is past&#x2014;and now you roam</l>
<l>Far from your wife&#x2014;your child your home</l>
<l>Joy which might still have been your own</l>
<l>But shall I love my Byron less</l>
<l>Because he knows not happiness</l>
<l>Ah no&#x2014;tho&#x2019; worlds condemn him now</l>
<l>Though sharp tongued fame has sunk him low</l>

<p><pb id="pg-03-253" n="03:253"/>But to be done with sentiment, for the present, is not this a &#x201C;d&#x2014;d odd&#x201D; affair of our handsome Cousin&#x2019;s?

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Your letter has been here since Monday: I would have answered it directly, but a series of pressing engagements connected with the finishing of that Book, which I have all along been hurrying forward, occupied my head and hands, however my heart might be employed, and I had no moment of leisure to bestow on any thing beside. The most clamorous of these demands are now satisfied, and I proceed to treat deliberately of this most serious matter. To do so rightly I find somewhat difficult. It were easy for me to plant myself upon the pinnacle of my own poor selfishness, and utter a number of things proceeding from a very vulgar sort of pride; it were easy also to pour out over the affair a copious effusion of sentimental cant; but to express in simplicity the convictions of a man <hi rend="italic">wishing</hi> at least with his whole <pb id="pg-03-255" n="03:255"/>heart to act as becomes him, is not easy. Grant me a patient hearing; for I have things to say that require a mature and earnest consideration from us both.</p>
<p>In the first place, however, I must thank you heartily for your candour. Your letter bears undoubted evidence within itself of being a faithful copy of your feelings at the moment it was written; and this to me is an essential point. I may also assure you that my love for you is unabated; I know not that you were ever so dear to me as at this moment. Your resoluteness does not offend me; on the contrary, I applaud it. I also must be resolute: woe to both of us if we cannot be so! The miserable man is he who halts between two opinions, who would and would not, who &#x201C;longs for the merchandise and will not part with the price.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle quotes <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi>, Book VI: &#x201C;You cannot have the ware and the money both at once and he who always hankers for the ware without having heart to give the money for it. &#x2026;&#x201D;</note> He who has dared to look his destiny however frightful steadfastly in the face, to measure his strength with its difficulties, and once for all to give up what he cannot reach, has already ceased to be miserable.</p>
<p>Your letter is dictated by good sense and sincerity: but it shows me that you have only an imperfect view of my present purposes and situation; there are several mistakes in it expressed or implied. It is a mistake to suppose that want of self-denial had any material share in causing this proposal: I hope I should at all times rather suffer pain myself than transfer it to you; but here was a very different case. For these many months the voice of every persuasion in my conscience has been thundering to me as with the Trump of the Archangel: &#x201C;Man! thou art going to destruction. Thy nights and days are spent in torment, thy heart is wasting into entire bitterness, thou art making less of life than the dog that sleeps upon thy hearth. Up, hapless Mortal! Up, and rebuild thy destiny if thou canst! Up in the name of God, that God who sent thee hither for other purposes than to wander to and fro bearing the fire of Hell in an unguilty bosom, to suffer in vain silence, and to die without ever having lived!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An important statement refuting the assumption that a permanent change of mood from despair to hope, upon which &#x201C;The Everlasting No,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Center of Indifference,&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Everlasting Yea&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> were to be based, took place at Edinburgh during <date when="1821-08">August 1821</date>. See Carlisle Moore, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> and the Problem of Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x2018;Conversion,&#x2019;&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">PMLA</hi>, LXX (<date when="1955">1955</date>), 662&#x2013;81.</note> Now in exploring the chaotic structure of my fortunes, I find my affection for you intertwined with every part of it, connected with whatever is holiest in my feelings or most imperative in my duties. It is necessary for me to <pb id="pg-03-256" n="03:256"/>understand completely how this matter stands; to investigate my own wishes and powers in regard to it, to know of you both what you will do and what you will not do. These things once clearly settled, our line of conduct will be clear also. It was in such a spirit that I made this proposal; not, as you suppose, grounded on a casual jest of yours, or taken up in a moment of insane selfishness; but deliberated, with such knowledge as I had of it, for months; and calmly decided on as with all its strangeness absolutely the best for both of us. There was nothing in it of the Love-and-cottage theory; which none but very young novel-writers now employ their thoughts about. Had you accepted it, I should not by any means have thought the battle won: I should have hailed your assent and the disposition of mind it bespoke, with a deep but serious joy, with a solemn hope, as indicating the distinct possibility that two true hearts might be united and made happy thro&#x2019; each other, might by their joint unwearied efforts be transplanted from the parched wilderness where both seemed out of place, into scenes of pure and wholesome activity such as Nature fitted both of them to enjoy and adorn. You have rejected it; I think, wisely. With your actual purposes and views, we should both have been doubly wretched had you acted otherwise. Your love of me is completely under the controul of judgement, and subordinate to other principles of duty or expediency, your happiness is not by any means irretrievably connected with mine. Believe me, I am not hurt or angry: I merely wished to know. It was only in brief moments of enthusiasm that I ever looked for a different result. My plan was no wise one, if it did not include the chance of your denial as well as that of your assent.</p>
<p>The maxims you proceed by are those of common and acknowledged prudence; and I do not say that it is unwise in you to walk exclusively by them. But for me, my case is peculiar; and unless I adopt other than common maxims, I look upon my ruin as already sure. In fact I cannot but perceive that the stations from which we have looked at life and formed our schemes of it are in your case and mine essentially different. You have a right to anticipate excitement and enjoyment; the highest blessing I anticipate is peace. You are bound to pay deference to the criticisms of others and expect their approbation; I to pay comparatively little deference to their criticisms and to overlook their contempt. This is not strange; but it accounts for the wide discrepancy in our principles and intentions, and demands the serious study of us both.</p>
<p>In your opinion about sacrifices, felt to be such, I entirely agree: <pb id="pg-03-257" n="03:257"/>but at the same time, need I remind your warm and generous heart that the love which will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> make sacrifices to its object is no proper love? Grounded in admiration and the feeling of enjoyment, it is fit love for a picture a statue or a poem; but for a living soul it is not fit. Alas! my dearest, without deep sacrifices on both sides, the possibility of our union is an empty dream. It remains for us both to determine what extent of sacrifices it is worth. To me, I confess, the union with a spirit such as yours might be is beyond all price; worth every sacrifice, but the sacrifice of those very principles which would enable me to deserve it and enjoy it.</p>
<p>Then why not make an effort, attain rank and wealth, and confidently ask what is or might be so precious to me? Now, my best friend, are you sure that you have ever formed to yourself a true picture of me and my circumstances; of a man who has spent seven long years in <hi rend="italic">incessant</hi> torture, till his heart and head are alike darkened and blasted, and who sees <hi rend="italic">no</hi> outlet from this state, but in a total alteration of the purposes and exertions which brought it on? I speak not these things in the vain spirit of complaint, which is unworthy of me; but simply to show you how they stand. I must not and cannot continue this sort of life: my patience with it is utterly gone; it were better for me, on the soberest calculation, to be dead, than to continue it much longer. Even of my existing capabilities I can make no regular or proper use, till it is altered. These capabilities, I have long seen with regret, are painted in your kind fancy under far too favourable colours. I am not without a certain consciousness of the gifts that are in me; but I should mistake their nature <hi rend="italic">widely</hi>, if I calculated that they would ever guide me to wealth and preferment, or even certainly to literary fame. As yet the best of them is very immature; and if ever they should come forth in full strength, it must be to other and higher ends that they are directed. How then? Would I invite a generous spirit out of affluence and respectability to share with me obscurity and poverty? Not so. In a few months I might be realizing from literature and other kindred exertions the means of keeping <hi rend="italic">poverty</hi> at a safe distance; the elements of real comfort, which in your vocabulary and mine I think has much the same meaning, might be at my disposal; and farther than this, I should think it injudicious to expect that external circumstances could materially assist me in the conduct of life. The rest must <supplied>[de]</supplied>pend upon myself, and the regulation of my own affections and habits. Now this is what <supplied>[I would]</supplied> do were it in my power: I would ask a generous spirit, one whose happiness weightily <pb id="pg-03-258" n="03:258"/><supplied>[depended]</supplied> on seeing me happy, and whose temper and purposes were of kindred to my own; I would as<supplied>[k such]</supplied> a noble being to let us unite our resources, not her wealth and rank merely, for these were a small and unessential fraction of the prayer; but her judgement, her patience, prudence, her true affection, to mine; and let us try if by neglecting what was not important, and striving with faithful and inseparable hearts after what was, we could not rise above the miserable obstructions that beset us both, into regions of serene dignity, living as became us in the sight of God and all reasonable men, happier than millions of our brethren, and each acknowledging with fervent and unspeakable gratitude that to the other he owed all, all. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> are such a generous spirit; but your purposes and feelings are not such. Perhaps it is happier for you that they are not.</p>
<p>This then is an outline, intended to be true, of my unhappy fortune and strange principles of action. Both I fear are equally repulsive to you. Yet the former was meant for a faithful picture of what Destiny has done to me; and the latter are positively the best arms which my resources offer me to war with her. I have thought of these things till my brain was like to crack. I do not pretend to say that my conclusions are indubitable; I am still open to better light; but this at present is the best I have. Do you also think of all this; not in any spirit of anger, but in that spirit of love and noble mindedness, which you have always shewn me. Anger! Good God! why should we be angry? Are we not alone in the world, each almost without a single counsellor save the other? Let us, my Dearest, unite our little portions of experience, and sit in solemn judgement on the interests of both, which are alike involved in the decision, and alike precious to us. And if we must part (which may the God that made us both forbid!), let us part in tenderness, with the last warm kiss of love upon our lips, and go forth upon our several paths, lost to the future, but in possession of the past. Now shame on me, if by these representations, I meant to bend your faithful spirit to any selfish purpose! Shame on me for a heartless Jew! Have you not loved me, have you not leant upon me as your guardian and guide? O my Dearest, you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> dear to me as the light of life:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle used this figure in the epitaph which he composed for her tomb in <date when="1866">1866</date>.</note> to see you truly good and happy is the cry of my inmost heart. It is only when I contrast my weakness with your wishes, that the despair of ever being yours comes over me.</p>
<p>You will think of these things and write me what you think. But <pb id="pg-03-259" n="03:259"/>the decision is important; let us decide nothing rashly; let us postpone it till I see you in Scotland, which ought to be now in a very few weeks. After all, why if we truly love each other, should not every thing be well!&#x2014; To your Mother, return my heartfelt thanks for her kind and tolerant opinion of me, which I hope it will be my study to deserve. What I think of her, you know better than she does, and it is needless to repeat it here.</p>
<p>I will not end in tragedy, tho&#x2019; my letter is gloomy enough in its purport, and perhaps my sickness (greater to-day than usual) has given additional gloom to its expression. I will part in cheerfulness. Is that farm of yours <hi rend="italic">really</hi> to be let? And where is it, and who has the letting of it? My Brother and I have long had a scheme of conjoint farming; and I feel more and more the essentialness of something like it to my recovery. Now why should we not be <hi rend="italic">your</hi> tenants! It seems to me that I could delve and prune with ten times tenfold pleasure, if I thought my delving and pruning were in any shadow of a sense for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. I am quite serious in this: do not neglect to tell me when you write, and I will make the boy look after it. You have no notion of my tolerance of places. After being every night for many years disturbed in my sleep by the noise of cities, and stunned and choked every day by their tumults and their smoke, <hi rend="italic">any</hi> thing with green grass upon it and blue sky above it has the air of paradise to me. Now write my Dearest! Be good to me if you can; above all, be candid. <closer><salute>May God bless you forever, and guide us to one another&#x2019;s hearts if it be possible! Yours wholly &#x26; ever,</salute></closer></p>

<p>In a paper which would reach thee yesterday, I promised to write, whenever that <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> was off my hands; an event which I expected would take place this present Saturday. A man may speculate about his own capacities of action; but woe to him if his calculations include the indolence and capricious mischances of others. Two sheets of this poor book are still to print; and I do not hope to be rid of it for another week. On the whole it is going to be a very pitiful <pb id="pg-03-260" n="03:260"/>but yet not utterly worthless thing; a volume of 350 pages with portrait, extracts, &#x26;c; not well printed, worse written, yet on the whole containing nothing that I did not reckon true, and wanting nothing which my scanty and forlorn circumstances allowed me to give it. So I &#x201C;commit it silently&#x201D; either to &#x201C;everlasting Time,&#x201D; or everlasting oblivion; caring no jot about what the despicable gang of newspaper and magazine critics say of it, or whether they speak of it at all. I do find there is nothing but this for it: Convince yourself that your work <hi rend="italic">is</hi> what you call it, as nearly as your honest powers could make it; and the man who censures it, either tells you nothing that you did not know before, or tells you lies; both of which sorts of intelligence you will find it a very simple matter to light your pipe with. There was a luckless wight of an <hi rend="italic">Opium-eater</hi> [underscored twice] here, one Dequincey, for instance, who wrote a very vulgar and brutish Review of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> in the London Magazine:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1824-08">Aug. 1824</date>, pp. 189 ff.; <date when="1824-09">Sept. 1824</date>, pp. 291 ff.</note> I read three pages of it one <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> day at Birmingham; and said: &#x201C;Here is a man who writes of things which he does not rightly understand; I see clean over the top of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, and his vulgar spite, and his common-place philosophy; and I will away and have a ride on (Badams&#x2019;) Taffy, and leave <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to cry in the ears of the simple.&#x201D; So I went out, and had my ride accordingly; and if Dequincey, poor little fellow, <hi rend="italic">made</hi> any thing by his review, he can put it in his waistcoat pocket, and thank the god Mercurius. A <hi rend="italic">counter</hi>-criticism of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> (or something like one) is to appear in the February No.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> I believe: to this also I hope I shall present the same tolerant spirit. The &#x2018;reviews&#x2019; of that book <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> must not go without their effect on me: I know it and believe it and feel it to be a book containing traces of a higher far higher spirit, altogether more <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> than any book published in my day: and yet to see the Cockney animalcules rendering an account of it! praising it, or blaming it! sitting in judgement on Goethe with the light tolerance of a country Justice towards a suspected Poacher! As the child says: &#x201C;It was <hi rend="italic">grend</hi>!&#x201D;</p>
<p>With regard to my own movements after the conclusion of this most small of literary labours, there is yet nothing fixed determinately. That I shall return to Scotland pretty soon is I think the only point entirely decided. Here there is nothing adequate to induce my continuance. The people are stupid, and noisy; and I live at the easy rate of five-and-forty shillings per week! I say the people are stupid, not altogether unadvisedly; in point either of intellectual or moral culture, <pb id="pg-03-261" n="03:261"/>they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> some degrees below even the inhabitants of the &#x201C;Modern Athens.&#x201D; I have met no man of a true head and heart among them. Coleridge is a mass of richest spices, putrified into a dunghill: I never hear him <hi rend="italic">tawlk</hi>, without feeling ready to worship him and toss him in a blanket. Thomas Campbell is an Edinburgh small, made still smaller by growth in a foreign soil. Irving is enveloped with delusions and difficulties; wending somewhat down-hill, to what depth I know not; and scarcely ever to be seen without a host of the most stolid of all his Majesty&#x2019;s Christian people, sitting round him. I wonder often that he does not buy himself a tar-barrel, and once for all fairly light it under the Hatton-garden pulpit, and thus <foreign><hi rend="italic">ex fumo</hi></foreign> giving <foreign><hi rend="italic">lucem</hi></foreign>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Non fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem cogitat</hi></foreign>&#x201D;: &#x201C;His aim is not to bring smoke from fire but light from smoke&#x201D; (Horace, <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi>, ll. 143&#x2013;44).</note> bid <foreign>adieu</foreign> to the gross train-oil concern altogether. Then Procter, poor little Procter! I often feel that were I as one of these people, sitting in a whole body, by the cheek of my own wife, my feet upon my own hearth, I should feel distressed at seeing myself so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> poor in spirit. &#x201C;The which upon perceiving my mind would be staggered not a little.&#x201D; Literary men! The Devil in his own good time take all such literary men! One sterling fellow, like Schiller or even old Johnson would take half-a-dozen such creatures by the nape of the neck, between his finger and his thumb, and carry them forth to the nearest common sink. Save Allan Cunningham, an honest Nithsdale peasant, there is not one <hi rend="italic">man</hi> among them.</p>
<p>In short, Jack, it does not seem worth while to spend five-and-forty shillings weekly for the privilege of being near such penmen. I will come to Scotland, and have back my health. <hi rend="italic">This</hi>, of the health, I have as good as sworn. It is impossible for me to go weeping and wailing, thro existence, as I have been doing: if I should take to breaking stones upon the highway, I will be a <hi rend="italic">whole animal</hi>, not a bundle of disgust and torture as for many a long year I have been. Philosophy I have got and given myself in abundance; and I question often whether the most philosophical of all my tutors <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have exerted as much of that gift as I myself was silently doing at the very moment of his <hi rend="italic">pallabra</hi>: Philosophy! It is not to be tolerated, that a man should be schooled so! An ounce of castor-oil is more effectual on the heart of man than the whole Enchiridion of Epictetus. I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be whole then, tho&#x2019; I should invoke the very powers of Darkness to aid me. The means, the <hi rend="italic">earthly</hi> means of this are in my power, I think; if I knew how to guide them. Exercise and abstinence: these I must practice. <pb id="pg-03-262" n="03:262"/>Sometimes I think of commissioning Alick to go and get us a farm: I would fit up a comfortable room in it; delve and ride six hours every day; write two, and talk and sleep the rest: this thing, if I could persist in it for a year, would <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi> help nay cure me. I believe there is simply <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> wrong about me; but a general want of <hi rend="italic">vis</hi> and tone in the nervous system. So Badams thought, so I think. Well, how to mend it? Employ the body more, the spirit less! This is the general problem: oh for a clear head and a steady heart to solve it theoretically and practically! Canst thou not help me, thou youngest of the disciples of Galen? Hast thou not l<supplied>[earned]</supplied> &#x201C;the doses&#x201D;? Then learn them, in Heaven&#x2019;s name! Read Gregory&#x2019;s Conspect<supplied>[us]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Gregory (<date when="1753">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821">1821</date>), <hi rend="italic">Conspectus Medicin&#xe6; Theoretic&#xe6;</hi>, 2 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1780">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1782">82</date>).</note> and study English composition; and be a Doctor and cure me!</p>
<p>The Bullers made a kind of proposal that I should take Arthur with me to live, till next october, at the rate of &#xa3;200 per annum. This I rejected. But I have since been thinking, that it might perhaps answer me to get two or three such pupils, at the rate of &#xa3;250 or &#xa3;300 and set up house with them in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>! I design to speak with Irving on this matter. Several people here might help me: Mrs Strachey (one of the best women living) would do her utmost for me. On the whole I am not too partial to this scheme: the farm one, as most conducive to health, would perhaps suit me better. Let us all stick together, boy, all true as the Holland sheaf of arrows, and there will be no fear. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Per ardua ad alta</hi></foreign>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Through difficulties to the heights.</note></p>
<p>Brewster&#x2019;s letter was on the subject of Schiller&#x2019;s works: his Book-sellers fight shy; it was to be looked for: the <hi rend="italic">scooneril Boyd</hi>, whom I since sounded on the matter &#x2018;respectfully declines.&#x2019; I have another scheme for them in the matter of these <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi>; I mean I would give a series of such. But I purpose letting <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x2019;s Life</hi> come out, before I talk more of it. It will shew at least that I am an <hi rend="italic">entity</hi>. I expect it will be with you early in February.</p>
<p>Now Jack, my dear Boy, thou seest this letter has been taken up exclusively with myself: do thou sit down <hi rend="italic">directly</hi>, and fill one with details upon the corresponding topic. How art thou? Is thy cold gone? Take care of it, and thyself, I prithee. How prosper thy studies? I look to thee, my honest boy, with confidence and hope, for much influence on the comfort of my future life. Be patient and strong and fear nothing.&#x2014; The Mainhill people said <hi rend="italic">ganz wohl</hi> last week, but they <pb id="pg-03-263" n="03:263"/>owe me a letter. Tell Murray I got his letter and saw his <hi rend="italic">proteg&#xE9;</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Alexander Torrance, who matriculated at Edinburgh University in <date when="1810">1810</date>, the year after Murray and Carlyle. The fact that he dropped out the next year may account for Carlyle&#x2019;s not knowing him. Murray writes that Torrance had emigrated in <date when="1823">1823</date> but &#x201C;did not find that land of liberty what he wished and expected.&#x201D; He suggests that Irving, &#x201C;a host in himself,&#x201D; may help him, but &#x201C;I would not have ventured to have asked thus much notwithstanding your uncommon benevolence and desire of doing good, were I not unspeakably anxious about the welfare of Mr. Torrance. He is a person of extreme,&#x2014;of feminine modesty, of the purest heart, of the most diffident and insinuating manner, and of the most innocent conduct.&#x201D; (TM to TC, <date when="1823-12-27">27 Dec.</date>)</note> whom I introduced to Irving, and got all done for that could be done: he (Torrance) is evidently an <hi rend="italic">innocent man</hi>, far too innocent for prospering here.&#x2014; Write instantly! Man was never in a hurry such as mine: the post hour is just at hand, and I have far to run; for the <hi rend="italic">near</hi> offices are shut already. <closer><salute>Good night my dear Boy!

<dateline>[<date when="1825-01-29">29 January 1825</date>]</dateline>
<p><salute>Well! Dearest you have criticised <hi rend="italic">my</hi> letter&#x2014;it is now my turn to criticise <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>.</salute> Be patient, then, and good-tempered, I beg; for you shall find me a severer critic than the Opiumeater&#x2014;</p>
<p>First then, you complain that I have but an imperfect view of your situation and purposes&#x2014; Now I think, I may complain with equal justice, that you have but an imperfect view of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> meaning&#x2014; This, indeed, is, most probably, no fault of yours. I wrote to you after a sleepless night, with an aching head, and an aching anxious heart, and it is no wonder, if, in this condition I failed to express myself as perspicuously as I wished&#x2014; Thus, in what I said about self-denial, it certainly was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> my meaning to reproach you with any want of it; but on the contrary to express my confidence in your magnanimity&#x2014;your willingness, at all times to prefer my happiness to your own. To say that &#x201C;had you foreseen how unhappy your letter was to make me, you would not have written it&#x201D; surely implied that &#x201C;in writing it, you had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> foreseen how unhappy it was to make me&#x201D;; now, in this case there was no <hi rend="italic">occasion</hi> for self-denial; and consequently you could not <pb id="pg-03-264" n="03:264"/>be charged with any want of it&#x2014; Neither did I imagine, that your proposal was <hi rend="italic">grounded on my jest</hi> or <hi rend="italic">taken up in a moment of selfishness</hi>. I have too good an opinion of your sense, to suspect you of making a proposal like this, with no better foundation, and conceived in no better spirit to any one; and too proud a consciousness of your esteem to suspect you of making it to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. It was not the idea of our union, but the idea of living at Craigenputtock, which I took to be grounded on my jest; and this was reasonable enough, seeing that my words were gravely quoted, by way of text to your letter&#x2014; This much in justice to my understanding!</p>
<p>In the next place, you assure me, that you are not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">hurt</hi> or <hi rend="italic">angry</hi>.&#x201D; Thank Heaven you are not! But does not this imply that there is some room for your being hurt or angry&#x2014;that I have done or said what might have hurt or angered another less generous than you? I think so. Now, room for disappointment there <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be; but surely there is none for mortification or offence&#x2014; I have refused my immediate, positive assent to your wishes; because our mutual happiness seemed to require that I should refuse it; but for the rest I have not slighted your wishes, on the contrary, I have expressed my willingness to fulfil them, at the expence of every thing but what I deem to be essential to our happiness: and so far from undervaluing <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, I have shown you, in declaring I would marry no one else, not only that I esteem you above all the men I have ever seen; but also that I am persuaded I should esteem you above all the men I may ever see&#x2014; What, then, have you to be hurt or angry at?</p>
<p>The maxims I proceed by (you tell me) are those of common and acknowledged prudence, and you <hi rend="italic">do not say</hi> it is unwise in me to walk by them exclusively&#x2014; The maxims I proceed by are the convictions of my own judgement, and being so, it would be unwise in me were I <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to proceed by them, whether they are <hi rend="italic">right</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>&#x2014; Yet I am <hi rend="italic">prudent</hi>, I fear, only because I am not strongly tempted to be otherwise&#x2014; My heart is capable (I feel it is) of a love to which <hi rend="italic">no</hi> deprivation would be a sacrifice&#x2014;a love which would overleap that reverence for opinion with which education and weakness have begirt my sex, would bear down all the restraints which <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> and <hi rend="italic">expediency</hi> might throw in the way, and carry every thought and feeling of my being impetuously along with it&#x2014; But the all-perfect Mortal, who could inspire me with a love, so extravagant, is nowhere to be found&#x2014;exists nowhere but in the Romance of my own imagination! Perhaps it is better for me as it is&#x2014; A passion, like the torrent in the violence of its <pb id="pg-03-265" n="03:265"/>course, might perhaps too, like the torrent, leave ruin and desolation behind. In the mean time, I should be very mad, were I to act as if from the influence of such a passion, while my affections are in a state of perfect tranquillity. I have already explained to you the nature of my love for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>; that it is deep and calm, more like the quiet river, which refreshes and beautifys where it flows, than the torrent which bears down and destroys&#x2014; Yet it is materially different from what one feels for a statue or a picture&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then why not attain wealth and rank&#x201D;&#x2014;you say&#x2014;and it is you who have said it&#x2014;not <hi rend="italic">I</hi>&#x2014; Wealth and rank (to be sure) have different meanings, according to the views of different people; and what is bare sufficiency and respectability in the vocabulary of a young Lady may be called wealth and rank in that of a philosopher: but it certainly was not wealth or rank, according to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> views which I required you to attain. I merely wish to see you earning a <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> livelihood, and excercising the profession of a gentleman&#x2014;for the rest it is a matter of great indifference to me, whether you have hundreds or thousands a year, whether you are a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or a Duke&#x2014; To <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, it seems, that my wishes in this respect are far from unreasonable, even when <hi rend="italic">your</hi> peculiar maxims and situation are taken into account: nor was it wholely with the view to an improvement in your external circumstances, that I have made their fulfilment a condition to our union; but also with a view to some improvement in my sentiments towards you, which might be brought about in the meantime. In with<supplied>[h]</supplied>olding this motive in my former letter, I was guilty of a false and illtimed reserve. My tenderness for your feelings betrayed me into an insincerety which is not natural to me. I thought that the most decided objection to your circumstances would pain you less than the least objection to yourself; and accordingly let my denial seem to be grounded wholely on the former, while, in truth it is, in some measure grounded on both. But I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be sincere, I find, at whatever cost!</p>
<p>As I have said, then, in requiring you to better your Fortune I had some view to an improvement in my sentiments towards you in the meantime: I am not sure that they are proper sentiments for a Husband: they are proper for a Brother, a Father, a Gaurdian-spirit, but a Husband, it seems to me should be dearer still. This, then, independently of prudential considerations, would make me withhold my immediate assent to your proposal. At the same time, from the change which my sentiments towards you have already undergone, during the period of our acquaintance; I have little doubt but, that, in time, I <pb id="pg-03-266" n="03:266"/>shall be perfectly satisfied with them. One loves you (as Madame de Stael said of Necker) in proportion to the ideas and sentiments which are in oneself; according as my mind enlarges, and my heart improves, I become capable of comprehending the goodness and greatness which are in <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, and my affection for you increases. Not many months ago, I would have said it was impossible that I should ever be your wife; at present I consider this the most <hi rend="italic">probable</hi> destiny for me;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Miss Welsh tells Carlyle at a later date [see her letter to him of <date when="1826-06-28">28 June 1826</date>] that she had held herself his affianced wife from this time onwards&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> and in a year or so, perhaps, I shall consider it the only one. &#x201C;<foreign>Die Zeit ist noch nicht da</foreign>!&#x201D; [&#x201C;The time is not yet here!&#x201D;]</p>
<p>Thus then I have explained my mind to you as clearly and faithfully as I possibly can; and a strange, confused, inconsistent sort of mind it appears to be! However, from what I have said, it is plain (to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, at least,) what ought to be the line of our future conduct. Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> what you can to better your external circumstances; always, however, subordinately to your own principles, which I do not ask you to give up, which I shou<supplied>[l]</supplied>d despise you for giving up, whether I approved them or no&#x2014; While <hi rend="italic">I</hi> on the other hand do what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can, subordinately to nothing, to better <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> which I am persuaded is the surest way of bringing my wishes to accord with yours. (And let us leave the rest to Fate, satisfied that we have both of us done what lies with <hi rend="italic">us</hi> for our mutual happiness)&#x2014; If nevertheless, you can point out any line of conduct, to <hi rend="italic">my conviction</hi> better than this, you will find me ready and willing to follow it&#x2014;</p>
<p>There is one passage in your letter which I cannot conclude without noticing; I mean that in which you talk about <hi rend="italic">parting</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">going forth upon our several paths</hi>. I have pondered this passage in various moods; and am at last come to the conclusion that it is to be understood (as we are bound to understand every thing, in the Scriptures, derogatory to the justice and mercy of God) in a metaphorical sense&#x2014;for I will not believe that you ever seriously thought of parting from me, of throwing off a heart, which you have taught to lean upon you, till it is no longer sufficient for itself! You could never be so ungenerous! <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, who for years have shown and professed for me the most disinterested, most noble affection! How could I <hi rend="italic">part</hi> from the only living soul that understands me? I would marry you tomorrow rather! but then,&#x2014;our parting would need to be brought about by death or some despensation of uncontrollable Providence&#x2014; were <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to will it, <hi rend="italic">to part</hi> would no longer be bitter, the bitterness would be in thinking <pb id="pg-03-267" n="03:267"/>you unworthy. If indeed your happiness was to suffer from your intercourse with me in our present relation, I would not blame you for discontinuing it; tho&#x2019; I should blame you, perhaps, for not examining yourself better before you entered into it&#x2014; But how can that be? Your present situation is miserable; it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be altered; but is it with reference to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> that it must be altered? Is it <hi rend="italic">I</hi> who have made it miserable? No! you were as unhappy before we met as ever you have been since: the cause of your unhappiness then must lie in other circumstances of your destiny, which I have no connection with&#x2014;no real connection, however much I may seem to have, from being frequently associated with them in your mind. It is an alteration in these circumstances which your duty and happiness require from you; and not an alteration in your relation with me&#x2014;but what need is there of my most weak arguments to dissuade you from a purpose which you can never have entertained,&#x2014;which, if you had entertained it for one moment, your own heart would have argued you out of, the next. Oh no! we will never part&#x2014; Never!</p>
<p>Will you be done with this wild scheme of yours? I tell you it will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> answer; and you must positively play Cincin<supplied>[n]</supplied>atus somewhere else. With all your tolerance of places, you would not find, at Craigenputtock, the requisites you require; The light of Heaven, to be sure, is not denied it; but for gre<supplied>[en]</supplied> grass! beside a few cattle fields there is nothing except a wa<supplied>[ste]</supplied> prospect of heather, and black peat-moss. Prune and delve wo<supplied>[uld]</supplied> you! in the first place there is nothing to prune; and for delving&#x2014;I set too high a value on your life, to let you engage in so perilous an enterprise&#x2014;were you to attempt such a thing, there are twenty chances to one, that you should be swallowed up in the moss&#x2014;spade and all. In short, I presume, whatever may be your <hi rend="italic">farming</hi> talents, that you are not an accomplished Drover; and nobody but a person of this sort, could make the rent of the place out of it. Were <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to engage in the concern we should all be ruined together!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You will write immediately&#x2014;wont you? and for Heaven&#x2019;s sake say something to make me less unhappy than I am at present&#x2014; There has been the weight of a mill-stone at my heart for these last two weeks&#x2014; I would have written sooner, but I have been tormented with headach<supplied>[e]</supplied>, as usual, which unfits me for every exertion of thought, while it lasts</p>

I ought to thank this villain of a <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> with all its sickening influences, for having kept me at home to-day: had I gone to Shooter&#x2019;s Hill, I might have seen Mrs Buller and the Orator; but I should have missed the most delightful piece of news that could have visited my doubting spirit. This letter is, I think, the best you ever sent me; there is more of the true woman, of the essence of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Jane&#x2019;s honourable nature in it, than I ever saw before. Such calm quiet good-sense, and such confiding simple true affection! I were myself a pitiable man, if it did not move me. Had my last solemn letter been directed to a common &#x201C;accomplished Heiress,&#x201D; mercy! What a fume it would have put her into! Tears and hysterics; followed by all the abusive epithets in the romance vocabulary; objurgations and recriminations; till the whole concern went off like a rocket, leaving nothing but smoke and darkness behind it. In place of all which, you see in that very grave epistle nothing but the sincere attempt, however awkward, of a man that loves you faithfully, and longs with all his heart to find out the proper path for himself and you to walk in; and you come frankly forward with your own meek and clear and kind sentiments to help him in that arduous undertaking. Let us proceed in this spirit, my Dearest; and I feel confident the result will be blessed to us both. It is not our circumstances alone, as you observe, but ourselves that require change: Fortune, niggard as she is, will not deny us the means of making one another happy, if we know how to use and deserve them. Shall I confess it, dear as you are to my heart, I feel that I do not love you with a tithe of that affection which you might merit and obtain from me. It seems as if I <hi rend="italic">dared</hi> not love you! That nobleness of nature, that generous tho&#x2019; aimless striving for perfection attracts me towards you as with the force of fascination: but my understanding seems to call upon me to beware, seems to tell me that situated and intentioned as we are, it can be for good to neither of us. A thousand times have I denounced the artificial misdirections and delusions that defaced the pure celestial ardour of your soul; a thousand times have I wished that you had been some humble maiden with no possession no accomplishment but the etherial spirit, the true fervent heart, <pb id="pg-03-269" n="03:269"/>which Nature gave you; that you might have joined with me, mind and hand, in the great and only right pursuit of life, the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> not <hi rend="italic">seeming</hi> perfection of our characters, the proper guidance and contentment of the faculties that Providence has committed to our charge. Alas! Jane, we are both far astray! But we shall return, we shall; and be good and happy after all our errors. Is there not a fund of honesty in both of us? Have we not hearts to reverence true excellence, and judgements which must at length perceive it? I have been sharply taught; and you too seem to be finding out the truth. There is in this very letter a spirit of genuine womanhood which gives me the most precious hopes. O my own darling, <hi rend="italic">were</hi> you but the being which your endowments indicate, with what entireness could I give up my whole soul to you, and love and reverence you as the fairest work of God, and <hi rend="italic">be</hi> one heart and mind and life with you to the latest moment of my existence! This is elysium, and I swear it shall not all fail and pass away in vain. Is it not worth striving for? To be enshrined in one another&#x2019;s hearts forever; united by the bonds of Truth; blessed in each other beyond the power of Fate to ruin us utterly! O that I could banish from myself and you the pitiful impediments and deceptions that distort our nature! The rest were <hi rend="italic">all</hi> within our reach. Think, then, study, strive along with me, my own true Jane! Let our Love for each other be the Divinity that guides our steps to genuine felicity and worth; and we shall bless forever the hour that first brought us together.</p>
<p>One sovereign aid in our progress I take to be <hi rend="italic">sincerity</hi>; and this I propose that we should practice more and more towards one another. For <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, for our affection, there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no basis but Truth; let us know one another as we are, and shape our conduct and principles by our united judgement. I blush to think how often other motives than real love for your permanent advantage have mingled in what I said to you; how often I have I have [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] turned my words to the interests of the passing hour, and repressed the honest tho&#x2019; discordant voice of truth that was speaking at the bottom of my heart, and might have chaced the smile from your eyes but would have profited you notwithstanding. It was wrong, and we have strength enough to take another course. It is the common fault of the thing called love: but now that we have the hope, the glorious probability before us of passing our existence together, it is fit that we discard such errors as much as in our power. Let us learn to speak truth to one another! It is a bitter morsel, that same truth, bitter na<supplied>[u]</supplied>seous morsel; but it is the grand <pb id="pg-03-270" n="03:270"/>specific of the soul. The man that dares to meet it in all its forms is happy become of him what may. Depend upon it, then, my dearest, we must gradually introduce the custom of lecturing one another on our faults, and shewing to each other aspects of our own minds that are far from pleasant! As yet, it seems to me, I am but in contact with you one [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] some small corners of my being: but you shall yet see me and know me altogether. I hope you will not hate me; ultimately, I know you will not; but at any rate you shall not be deceived. You abhor cant as deeply, and have as quick an eye for it, as myself or any one: it is our duty to help each other to get rid of it and destroy it utterly.</p>
<p>When I come back to Scotland (which will be directly) I mean to spend a whole fortnight, if your Mother will allow me, in lecturing you and being lectured! I have a thousand things to explain and get explained. Let us talk freely, let us unbosom ourselves to each other without reserve. The discrepancies that divide us will vanish, if light were thrown on them; at least they will be put upon the way of vanishing. Do you know, I heartily rejoice that you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> write a book at present! Had you succeeded in these enterprises, certain Milliners&#x2019; apprentices might have adored you, and you would have had a rank among the Blues of this planet; but as a woman it would have proved your ruin. This is sure as fate. Gifts like yours are fit for something else than scribbling; and the way to cultivate them is to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> them what you would have them seem and represent. Writing follows of course; when you have once attained the perfection of <hi rend="italic">practice</hi>, it is easy to <hi rend="italic">depict</hi> it. Otherwise, I think it had better never follow. Vex not your heart on this subject: I know you will and must see it as I do; for I once saw it exactly as you. Do you think I need the voices of reviewing men (or rather <hi rend="italic">mennikin</hi>) of letters to shew me that you are gifted and lovely? Could I not have guessed it for myself? It is not for writing that my heart will honour anyone, or wish any one to honour me: it is for <hi rend="italic">being</hi> in some measure what the object of all useful writing is only to <hi rend="italic">describe</hi>.</p>
<p>But a truce with lecturing for the present! I must absolutely give you a little respite. I am coming home, as I have told you, almost forthwith. That <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> is <supplied>[at]</supplied> length fairly off my hands: it is to be sent round the &#x2018;Trade&#x2019; to-morrow; then I settle with <supplied>[the]</supplied> knaves, and bid <foreign>adieu</foreign> to them and their concerns. The Book will be an honest enough book, an octavo of 350 pages; not destined for a long life; but as it contains nothing that I judged disgraceful to me, my conscience <pb id="pg-03-271" n="03:271"/>is satisfied, and I care not one doit what the purblind cockneys make of it, whether they tear it to pieces in their rascally magazines or let it lie and rot forever on the shelves of the Bibliopolist. I thank Heaven, that it is so with me! That the &#x2018;fame&#x2019; conferred by such unhappy members of society <hi rend="italic">is</hi> every day growing more and more indifferent to me. &#x2018;Fame!&#x2019;&#x2014; The very sound of it is distressing to my ears. Oh that I could show you the worshippers of it whom I have met with here! To see how the shallow spirits of these scribes are eaten up by this mean selfish passion; how their whole blood seems to be changed by it into gall, and they stand hissing like as many rattle-snakes each over his own small very small lot of that commodity! I swear to you I had rather be a substantial peasant that eat my bread in peace, and loved my fellow mortals, tho&#x2019; I scarcely knew that my own parish was not all the universe, than one of these same miserable metre-ballad-mongers, whose heart is dead or worse, for whom creation is but a mirror to reflect the image of his own sorry self and still sorrier doings! An hour with Coleridge or Procter would do more for you, than a month of my talking. You would forswear <hi rend="italic">fame</hi> forever and a day! There is a passage in this Schiller (by himself) which, if you make many words, I will force you to get by heart Madam, and repeat every day along with your devotions! It is my very creed, expressed with Schiller<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>s eloquence.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle quotes Schiller as follows in his biography of the German poet (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXV): &#x201C;Unhappy mortal, who with science and art, the noblest of all instruments, effectest and attemptest nothing more than the day-drudge with the meanest; who, in the domain of perfect Freedom, bearest about in thee the spirit of Slave&#x201D; (p. 200); and &#x201C;The Artist, it is true, is the son of his age; but pity for him if he is its pupil, or even its favourite. &#x2026; But how is the Artist to guard himself from the corruptions of his time, which on every side assail him? By despising its decisions. Let him look upwards to his dignity and his mission, not downwards to his happiness and his wants&#x201D; (p. 201&#x2013;2).</note></p>
<p>Your copies of the Book you may expect in about a fortnight; but these Booksellers are a class of creatures whom it <supplied>[is]</supplied> unsafe to place any faith on. Fear not, you will see it soon enough. For myself, I leave London in a week: I go by Birmingham and Liverpool to Mainhill; rest there for a little space, and then most probably come up to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, to arrange some future occupation. I have plenty of schemes; and a little trust in some of them. My health is bad, but not irrecoverable; and I have sworn by the Fatal Sisters that I will recover it, and keep it so, tho&#x2019; I take to cutting ditches for a livelihood. I believe with Badams that there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> organ about me specially deranged; only an over-worked system of nerves, &#x201C;a spirit too keen for the case that holds it.&#x201D; <pb id="pg-03-272" n="03:272"/>This must and shall be remedied: I must live in the country, and work with my muscles more, and with my mind less. By and by it will all be well, and then&#x2014;!&#x2014; What a place this Craigenputtock must be! I declare I should like to see it. So you will not have me drowned in peat-bogs, useless as I am? Especially if the <hi rend="italic">spade</hi> should be lost too! Devil take you!</p>
<p>On the whole I am leaving London with regret, and with the hope of often seeing it again. I think I have made one <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> here, and that is almost like an epoch in my life. Mrs Strachey really likes me, and with all her obscurity of intellectual culture, she is an interesting true-minded woman. She loves and reverences nobleness of mind in others, and follows it more honestly, than any creature I have ever seen&#x2014;with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> exception, whom if you should die guessing, you would never hit on. I have promised to make her acquainted with you, whom she already knows (whence I understand not) and respects for your conduct to the Orator and his dear Isabella. With the Orator himself I am sorry to part, tho&#x2019; fortune has already parted us to a considerable degree, wherever we may be in place. He is a good man; tho&#x2019; he cannot speak or act one hour without cant, he really means to be sincere. He loves one too, but the void your absence leaves in his heart is so very soon and so unscrupulously filled up, that it were unwise to set much store by it. Poor fellow! He has his own trials waiting him. Rejoice that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> came not near him! It would have shook the whole establishment! From stupidity, from cant, from quackery Good Lord deliver us!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Already Irving&#x2019;s delusion that he had a prophetic role to play was beginning to master him, and, according to Carlyle, he said in conversation with Mrs. Strachey at about this time: &#x201C;<supplied>[The]</supplied> Christian Religion was to be a truth again, not a paltry form, and to rule the world,&#x2014;he, unworthy, even he the chosen instrument!&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 135).</note></p>
<p>Now it will not be safe to write to me here any more. Will you have a letter for me at Mainhill in ten days? I will <hi rend="italic">never</hi> answer it while I live. Now is your heart lighter? You owe me ten kisses, which at compound interest already amount to a score.&#x2014; Your poor head! Do go out and walk, and drive these Gilchrists from you, and amuse yourself! It is all you want. Also love me forever. <closer><salute>God bless thee! Thine forever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I expected a letter from Alick before this time; but as he still seems inclined to linger, I take up the pen myself to inquire how matters stand with you, and at the same time to communicate some outline of my own future movements, which are now about to undergo some change. I hope the boy has already a letter on the road for me, or at least will despatch one without another moment&#x2019;s delay, that I may hear of your proceedings and situation once again before leaving London. For the present, I can only hope that all things with you are as usual, and that nothing but business or indolence prevents me from hearing of you.</p>
<p>I have at last finished that miserable book; on account of which I have been scolding printers, and running to and fro like an evil spirit for the last three weeks. I do hope I shall never more have to do with such a set of lazy paltering Littleworths of people in any similar business. The whole burden of conquering delays and difficulties has lain upon me; and having nothing else but this to keep me so long in the smoke and tumult of this <hi rend="italic">Wen</hi>, my patience was now and then on the point of giving way. However the <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> is now fairly out of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hands; the Booksellers engage to shew it on their counters on Wednesday;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This would be two days later, <date when="1825-02-02">2 Feb.</date></note> they send a parcel of copies off to Edinburgh forthwith; then they must pay me my &#xa3;90; after which I care not if they let the thing lie and rot beside them till the day of Doom. On the whole, it will make a reputable sort of book; somewhat larger than a volume of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, with a portrait &#x26;c: I have not put my name to it, not feeling anxious to have the syllables of my poor <hi rend="italic">name</hi> pass thro&#x2019; the mouths of Cockneys on so slender an occasion; tho&#x2019; if any one lay it to my charge, I shall see no reason to blush for the hand I had in it. Sometimes of late I have bethought me of some of your old maxims about pride and self-conceit: I do see this same vanity to be the root of half the evil men are subject to in life. Examples of it stare me in the face every day: the pitiful passion, under any of the thousand forms which it assumes, never fails to wither out the good and worthy parts of a man&#x2019;s character; and leave him poor and spiteful, an enemy to his own <pb id="pg-03-274" n="03:274"/>peace and that of all about him. There never was a wiser doctrine than that of <hi rend="italic">Christian humility</hi>, considered as a corrective for the coarse unruly selfishness of men&#x2019;s nature.</p>
<p>I will send <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a copy of this <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>; and I know you will read it with attention and pleasure. It contains nothing that I know of but <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> of fact and sentiment; and I have always found that the honest truth of one mind had a certain attraction in it for every other mind that loved truth honestly. Various quacks, for instance, have exclaimed against the <hi rend="italic">immorality</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>; and the person whom it delighted above all others of my acquaintance, was Mrs Strachey, exactly the most religious pure and true-minded person among the whole number. A still more convincing proof of my doctrine was the satisfaction <hi rend="italic">you</hi> took in it. <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>, tho&#x2019; it flies with a low, low wing, compared with <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, will have less in it to offend you. What is it, in fact, but your own sentiments, the sentiments of my good true-hearted mother, expressed in the language and similitudes that <hi rend="italic">my</hi> situation suggests? So you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> like it!</p>
<p>The point next to be considered, is what shall be done with the Author of this mighty work? He is a deserving youth, with a clear conscience, but a bad bad stomach: what shall be done with him? After much consideration, I have resolved in the first instance <hi rend="italic">to come home</hi>! Irving wants &#x201C;a week of talk&#x201D; with me before I go; by the time that is done I shall have settled my affairs here, taken leave of the good people; and be about ready to take flight. I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> coming by sea: so take no thought of it. My last voyage satisfied me of sailing: I mean to come by Birmingham (where I shall rest a day or two), then perhaps by Oldham (where George Johnstone is), and so by Liverpool home to Annandale. The journey will be a pleasure rather than a task. With regard to my subsequent proceedings, there must be some consideration, but not an hour of loitering. I have set out before my mind distinctly what <hi rend="italic">I want</hi>, and this as Goethe says is half the game. <hi rend="italic">I will recover my health</hi>, tho&#x2019; all the Books in the Universe should go to smoke in the process! I will be a whole man, no longer a pining piping wretch, tho&#x2019; I should knap stones by the wayside for a living! This is one fixed point: I must now try whether it is in my power to realize it.</p>
<p>I had some scheme of setting up house in Edinburgh, and taking two or three pupils whose education I might superintend at College; beginning with Arthur Buller, and a boy of Mrs Strachey&#x2019;s who perhaps might incline entrusting him to me. Irving was to speak with her <pb id="pg-03-275" n="03:275"/>on the subject on friday; but I have not yet heard her opinion: nor in truth am I very anxious about it; for I already perceive that this project will not suit my chief purpose any thing like exactly. In preference to this, I recur to the old plan of farming and living in the country. This I really do think might be made to do. What might hinder Alick and me to take a farm, and move to it with you and some other of the younkers; furnishing up an apartment in the house for my writing operations, and going on in our several vocations with all imaginable energy? My Father might join us when the <foreign>tack</foreign> [lease] of Mainhill was out: for to Mainhill the pr<supplied>[esent s]</supplied>tate of the house, if there were no other objection, would itself be an insuperable bar. You must take counsel with the whole senate on this matter: I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have a house of my own (<hi rend="italic">a bit haddin&#x2019;</hi> [holding] <hi rend="italic">o&#x2019; my ain <foreign>frethit</foreign></hi> [entirely of my own]), where I can enjoy quiet and free air, and have liberty to do as I list; and I see no scheme so likely in the actual state of matters as this. Tell Alick to look about him on all sides for such a thing; a farm with a comfortable house to live in, and at a rent which we can front. I shall have &#xa3; 200 in my pocket, when I return, notwithstanding the horrible expensiveness of this place; and that with what we have already ought to put us on some sort of footing. I am not without hopes of getting more without farther exertions (should a second edition of Goethe&#x2019;s book be called for, which is not improbable); I could even perhaps borrow the sum that might be wanting; and were we once begun there would be no fear. I could write at a moderate rate without injuring myself, and make a handsome enough thing of it within the year. And for my health, with riding, gardening and so forth, it would to a certainty improve. I believe with Badams that there is in fact no particular organ about me diseased; that my ailment is purely a feeble state of the nerves, a &#x201C;soul too keen for the case that holds it.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Schiller, Works</hi>, XXV, 191.</note> Could I live without taking drugs for three months, I should even now be perfectly well. But drenching oneself with castor-oil and other abominations how can one be otherwise than weak and feckless? I must and will be out of this despicable state, come of it what may! Nor on the whole have I any great doubts about succeeding. Often of late I have even begun to look upon my long dismal seven years of pain as a sort of blessing in disguise. It has kept me clear of many temptations to degrade myself; and really when I look back upon my former state of mind I scarcely see how except by sickness or some most grinding calamity, I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have been delivered out of it into the state proper <pb id="pg-03-276" n="03:276"/>for a man in this world. Truly, as you say, the ways of that Being who guides our destiny, are wonderful, and past finding out. Let us trust that for all of us this will yet prove <hi rend="italic">the best</hi>!</p>
<p>I had millions of things to say; but my sheet is done. Tell Alick to resolve all this with immense thoughtfulness, and see what can be done. In <hi rend="italic">our farm</hi>, I am going to put <hi rend="italic">you</hi> under regimen, and make you as whole as you have ever been! I am convinced it is quite feasible. &#x2014; Alick must write the moment this arrives, or his letter may not find me here. In less than three weeks you may see me! <closer><salute>Good night, my dearest Mother!</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>I am ever your&#x2019;s, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p><supplied>[P.S.]</supplied> Since I finished this, I have got Alick&#x2019;s letter, and the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> all in order! Thank Alick and my dear Father for the pleasure and contentment they have given me: had I got their letter a day sooner, this sheet had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>. If I am more than three weeks from this date in coming home, I will write again. The Courier <hi rend="italic">does</hi> come regularly; but Alick need not send above <hi rend="italic">another</hi>. I am going out to Shooters Hill to see the Bullers; I should have gone to-day, but it was far better that I staid. I mean to send off my trunk by a Leith Smack this very week! But I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> go by land myself. Jack is quite well 4 days ago. You must give my warmest love to every soul at home. They will have to commence their <hi rend="italic">nursing</hi> whenever I return! This <hi rend="italic">seal</hi> is the Carlyle&#x2019;s crest, engraved from that dotard&#x2019;s &#x2018;History&#x2019; of the family.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anonymous, <hi rend="italic">Collection for a History of the Ancient Family of Carlisles</hi> (London, <date when="1822">1822</date>).

<p>You have plenty of eggs at Mainhill?

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I have at length found a vacant evening; and I gladly set about discharging a duty, which is gratifying in itself, and the neglect of which has caused some uneasiness to both of us. Your letter came to <pb id="pg-03-277" n="03:277"/>hand duly, as I stated in the Newspaper, but an unbroken series of petty occupations made it ever since next to impossible for me to answer it. When I tell you that I have had a nasty blubbering cold (till within three days), that I have been publishing books, paying visits, changing my abode, consulting doctors, and in almost daily expectation of leaving Town, you will find no difficulty in excusing me.</p>
<p>That unhappy <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> should have been in Edinburgh ere now: it was fixed for publication about ten days ago; when lo! to consummate the long series of delays, the poor Engraver (whom <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had recommended out of brotherly charity) discovered that the portrait was not right, and could not be properly perfected within a fortnight! My first idea was to shoot him thro&#x2019; the head, and burn the sheets of the work. My second thought was more rational: I made them stitch me up ten copies of the book, with the portrait as it was, to give in presents to my friends here; I settled with them for the price, which is now paid (&#xa3;87: 10), and took their solemn promise that they would send the work to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> the moment it was ready. Oliver &#x26; Boyd are to be their agents: I think you may expect to receive 15 copies thro&#x2019; them in about ten days from this date. Of these 15 copies you will send two to Haddington, and one to Dr Brewster (and one to <hi rend="italic">Dr Tongleg</hi>) without delay: the rest you can let lie beside you, till I see you or send you farther word.</p>
<p>I rejoice with all my heart that this silly affair is now off my hands. The aspect of the Book pleases me indifferently well; and I doubt not it will by and by meet with the degree of patronage which it deserves and lays claim to. That the Bibliopolists themselves are satisfied with it I infer from the fact of their having made me a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> offer on similar or rather on more advantageous principles for a <hi rend="italic">Life of Voltaire</hi>, which I told them I had some thoughts of writing. They propose to let me have the work printed in Edinburgh, if I incline; and to give me &#xa3;100 for the first edition of it, and another &#xa3;100 for every subsequent edition. I have yet given them no answer; nor do I mean to accede to their terms about <hi rend="italic">subsequent editions</hi>; designing rather to keep these for my own exclusive advantage, and myself profit by the labour of my mind, rather than give it up to the rapacity of rascal booksellers. However I will keep this offer in my eye, as considerably better than none; and ultimately accept of it, if no preferable one occur. My favourite scheme is still <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x2019;s Works</hi>, or rather a <hi rend="italic">series</hi> of translations from the German;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first mention of what eventually became <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>, 4 vols. (Edinburgh and London, <date when="1827">1827</date>).</note> an enterprise which <pb id="pg-03-278" n="03:278"/>might employ me long and usefully to myself and the English public. I design therefore to let this <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x2019;s Life</hi> have taken wind in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, before appearing there in person, that it may be at hand to refer to in all cases: about the time of its arrival, I will despatch a second letter to Brewster, and together he and I will stir the waters. I think there is no fear whatever that something reasonable may be done. For my own share I feel very easy as to the result. At the same time I think I should prefer Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> as a place of publication to London; for as I mean to take up my abode somewhere in the North, it is highly necessary that I form some connexions there with literary men and literary traders, and this seems to be the most rational mode of effecting it. We shall see.</p>
<p>With regard to my future residence, my own projects seem to tally very accurately with your advice. I have written to Alick to see if he can find us a sort of <hi rend="italic">farm</hi> with a reasonable house attached to it: I will furnish two apartments in it; take my Mother and him over to it (at least till Mainhill is abandoned or set on some new footing); thou shalt stay with us in summer; I will ride and delve and write: we must all try to cultivate civility and rational demeanour to ourselves and one another; and there I feel persuaded we might live in great profit and comfort together. I feel that I must have a house of my own; and this seems the best method of attaining it. The worst thing for me in the plan is the want of intellectual society which it implies. But I shall be in the midst of hearts that love me, which is the best item in all society; and with thee for a scholar and companion I cannot be alone even in intellectual matters. I think the scheme has a fair enough aspect at present; much better than the scheme of taking <hi rend="italic">pupils</hi>, which would meet with difficulties in the actual state of matters; and would certainly as you observe be unfavourable for the great object of all my plans, the complete reestablishment of my health. There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> nothing on Earth like liberty: let us enjoy it while we may!</p>
<p>In the mean time I am making preparations for departing from the <hi rend="italic">Wen</hi>, which I meant to have quitted some days ago. I propose travelling by Birmingham; both for the purpose of resting by the way, and also of taking farther counsel with Badams on the subject of drugs and regimen. Badams is <hi rend="italic">returning</hi> to Town (where I saw him the other day) to-morrow; I must consult him, and in part be regulated by his movements. I think it very likely that I shall be in Birmingham next <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi>. I may stay there for a day or two; in another week I may be <pb id="pg-03-279" n="03:279"/>at Mainhill; in less than a month, I expect to see you in Salisbury-street!</p>
<p>Irving wanted to have &#x201C;a week of talk&#x201D; with me; and I was at last prevailed upon, that I might accommodate Thomas Dickson who has succeeded me, to quit my lodgings, and conclude my London visit in Myddelton Terrace. I have been here since Saturday night. They are all off dining in the Country to-night; and I am sole lord of the Mansion. Irving and I are kinder than ever: adversity will teach him some wholesome lessons, and he has a true heart with all its errors. The people about him are of that sort <foreign><hi rend="italic">de quibus melius siletur</hi></foreign> [about whom it is better to be silent]: I respect him and feel a sympathy for him</p>
<p>He is not the only <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> I have in London. Excluding the Montagues who are babblers, and Badams who is a <foreign>Gascon</foreign> [braggart] in some points, there is Mrs Strachey<supplied>[, who]</supplied> likes me, and <hi rend="italic">would</hi> gladly see me happy. She and I are to correspond in the <supplied>[future.]</supplied> I will shew you a beautiful gold pencil which the good lady gave me by way <supplied>[o]</supplied>f <foreign><hi rend="italic">gage d&#x2019;amiti&#xE9;</hi></foreign> [token of friendship] the other night. It is poor to judge of people&#x2019;s worth merely by their treatment of <hi rend="italic">us</hi>: but I think, abstracting from this, Mrs S. is about the most sincere and truth-loving woman I have ever met with. She and Mrs Buller have a plan also for helping <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. They would get you a Doctor&#x2019;s place in the India Company&#x2019;s service (which I believe is in their power), or a <hi rend="italic">Surgeonship</hi> in an India vessel, which for a voyage or two might do you good; or in short any thing within their reach that might seem to you advantageous. Mrs Strachey talked of it to me the other night. I said that as to Doctorships or any <hi rend="italic">permanent</hi> settlement for you in India, it was a thing I could not consent to: you bade fair to be a man of some mark in your day, and your profession would support you at home; you were also like to prove what was best of all a truly honest man, and I could not afford to lose the support which I calculated on from your unfailing brotherhood and sympathy in our journey thro life; but as to the Surgeonship I had heard you speak of it as desirable, and you and I would take counsel about it, and in due time let them know. Study like a true man, my good Jack, and there is no fear of the result!</p>
<p>I have occupied this letter altogether with myself and my own concerns; but I know you will not like it the less on that account. The truth is I am unutterably confused at present; and but that I regret every moment of your anxiety I should not have written at all till I came home and felt myself at ease. Nothing here is as it should be. <pb id="pg-03-280" n="03:280"/>The paper is half <hi rend="italic">gray</hi>; I am more <hi rend="italic">billus</hi> than usual; I am in a strange house; and the <hi rend="italic">pen</hi> I scribble with is so unmanageably bad that I am actually using the <hi rend="italic">back</hi> of it! Jack will excuse every thing. To-morrow or next day, I mean to send off my trunk to your care by a Leith smack. If you do not hear from me again in a fortnight, write to me <hi rend="italic">at Mainhill</hi>. Most probably you will hear. By that time I expect the Copies of <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> will be in your possession. Send me all your cares and joys; for I participate in them all. Think of me in your darkest hours as of a Brother that <hi rend="italic">can</hi> never fail you.&#x2014; You may read <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi> whenever you like. Tell me what else you are reading. I wish I had <hi rend="italic">three</hi> sheets that I could fill for you at present: but soon we shall fill fifty sheets with talk.&#x2014; Lately I met <hi rend="italic">Will Bogs</hi> and John his brother in the Strand. They were well-dressed, but so evidently rascals that I declined giving them my address. Let us be <hi rend="italic">honest men</hi> whatever betide us!&#x2014; Write, unless I write! I already long to hear of you. <closer><salute>I am ever your affectionate Brother,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dearest</salute>
<p>You are welcome to Scotland again, since it must be so. I wished you to remain where you were; for London, it seemed to me, had more inducements to retain you than Scotland had to bring you back. But it was for you only to decide as to what you only understand and after all, I am persuaded that you are in the right,&#x2014;that you are more likely to find health and happiness among the honest unpretending hearts of <pb id="pg-03-281" n="03:281"/>your <hi rend="italic">Fatherland</hi>, than in the Great City, with all its Poets and Orators and Bluestockings, which you have left behind you.</p>
<p>Indeed, it would be difficult for you to do any thing that could make me doubt the propriety of your judgement. I know not how your spirit has gained such a mastery over mine in spite of my pride and stubbornness: but so it is&#x2014;tho&#x2019; self-willed as a Mule with others I am tractable and submissive towards <hi rend="italic">you</hi>; I hearken to your voice as to the dictates of a second conscience, hardly less awful to me, than that which nature has implanted in my breast. How comes it you have this power over me? for it is not the effect of your genius and virtue merely: sometimes, in my serious moods, I believe it a <hi rend="italic">charm</hi> with which my Good Angel has fortified my heart against evil&#x2014; Be that as it may, your influence has brought me nothing but good&#x2014;</p>
<p>When will you be here? Be sure you write beforehand, for I hate <hi rend="italic">surprises</hi>, however agreeable. I am longing to see you again; to hear your travels history<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, I, iii.</note> since we parted; and to talk with you over all our concerns. But how <hi rend="italic">am</hi> I to meet you <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. Do you know, I think it is more than probable that I will take to my own room, when you come, and not go out of it as long as you are in the house. Upon my word, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Thomas Carlyle, I can hardly forgive you for bringing me into this very shocking predicament&#x2014; Here am I blushing like an idiot, whenever your name is mentioned, so that any body, who looks at me, may read the whole matter in my face&#x2014;and then to be <hi rend="italic">half engaged&#x2014;I</hi> who have such a natural horror at engagements! it gives me asthma every time I think of it&#x2014; And yet such is the inconsistency of human nature, or of my particular nature, that I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> not, if I <hi rend="italic">might</hi>, be free. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Ce que je fait, je le ferois encore</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [&#x201C;What I am doing I would do again&#x201D;]. I cannot say this of much else I have done in my day&#x2014; You will come, however; and <hi rend="italic">at all events</hi>, you will see my Mother and Miss Gilchrist. I cannot think how this bur of a girl is to be got rid of. The term of her invitation expired last month; and here she is still; terrifying me by talking of what we are to do together weeks and months hence. These Gilchrists are as tenacious as bugs of their quarters; when they have once found their way into a house, their is no driving them out again. I looked to the London project for deliverance; but <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, I perceive, is to miscarry this Season, as it did the last: and I am not sorry. Now that you are gone, I should have little enjoyment in it; convinced as I am that Edward Irvings much vaunted friendship for me, is nothing more than a froth of professions. I will not quarrel with him however. <pb id="pg-03-282" n="03:282"/>I love him <hi rend="italic">still</hi>, after all he has done, and all that he has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> done,&#x2014;and I shall love him to the last&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">in memory</hi>: but I have ceased to admire him, to put trust in him&#x2014; He has disgusted me.</p>
<p>What a precious creature this M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Strachey must be! I am sure I shall like her; since she has the grace to be fond of you. How old is she? Seriously, you could not do me a more acceptable service, than making me acquaint<supplied>[ed]</supplied> with a <hi rend="italic">woman</hi>, about my own years, whom I could <hi rend="italic">really</hi> like.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Strachey was born in <date when="1791">1791</date> and died in <date when="1846">1846</date>. Thus she was ten years older than Jane and died twenty years before Jane&#x2019;s death.</note> I have never found such a one&#x2014;my female acquaintances are all either creatures of <hi rend="italic">no</hi> characters, made up of seemings; or they are so cold, so vain and selfish, that my heart shrinks from them. Our sex is certainly less friendly than yours; at least our affections are more easily perverted by self-interest. Men may be rivals, opponents in their fortunes, and yet be friends in their hearts, and fair towards each other&#x2019;s worth: but woman, the instant she is rivalled, becomes unjust. Mercy! what jealousies, what envyings and heart burnings are amongst us! I declare &#x2018;I would rather be a Kitten and cry Mew&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I had rather be a kitten and cry mew / Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">I Henry IV</hi>, III, i).</note> than live as I see many of my female acquaintance do, tearing each others characters to pieces, and wearing out their lives in &#x2018;vanity and vexation of Spirit.&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccles., <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>.</note> He was a wise man who thanked the gods that they had not made him a woman.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230324-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1823-03-24">24 March 1823</date></ref>.</note> There are twenty chances to one, that he would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have been <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> if they had.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I expected by this time almost to have been in Mainhill; and the date of my departure even from London is still in some degree uncertain. I am afraid our Mother will be getting anxious about me; so I sit down in the midst of bustle and hurry to assure you all that I am quite well, and prevented from coming home by no cause productive of any evil to me.</p>
<p>I expect that this weary <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> would have been published a fortnight ago, and just when every thing was ready on my part, the Engraver discovered that the portrait was not right and would require at least <hi rend="italic">two weeks</hi>! before it could be put properly in order! Of course I felt terribly enraged at this new delay; but what, alas, would rage do for me? I made them bind me up 10 copies of the Book to give away among my friends here; I got my money from the knaves, took their promise of proceeding with the utmost possible expedition in the matter tho&#x2019; I were absent; and thus washed my hands of the affair entirely. Irving in the meantime got me at length persuaded to come over to his quarters, &#x201C;to talk with him,&#x201D; and I have been here above a week &#x201C;talking&#x201D; with might and main. I have shipped my trunk for Leith; but reflecting that till after <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> had been some time in Edinburgh, it was useless for me to go thither. I have continued here, enjoying myself as the circumstances permitted, and waiting patiently till all things should be ready for my departure. One consideration <pb id="pg-03-284" n="03:284"/>that detains me is the wish to see a little more of Badams before my departure, and take his final views about the management of my health. He is here at this time; and counsels me strongly to stay with him a while before leaving England. He talks of leaving London about Saturday; and I have engaged to go with him to Birmingham, however long I may stay there; and carry with me his last precepts about the management of my outward man in Scotland. So that you perceive it is still a little uncertain when I may return to you: I can only promise to write to you from Birmingham, and tell you more particularly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, except perhaps for the loss of time, I feel perfectly comfortable here. Irving and I talk of all things under the sun, in the friendliest and most <hi rend="italic">edifying</hi> manner; and all my friends vie with one another in kindness to the departing dyspeptic. Several of them would fain retain me; and had I not vowed inflexibly to recover health of body in preference to all things, I should be strongly tempted to listen to their solicitations. But I feel that I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> grow completely well again; and seven years of perpetual pain have taught me sharply that to this consideration <hi rend="italic">every</hi> thing should give way. I hope however not to leave England for good and all at present; I have got real friends here, whom I should be sorry to quit forever. Mrs Strachey and I are to correspond by letters; so also are Mrs Montague and I: the former has presented me with a beautiful gold pencil; the latter with a seal bearing Schiller&#x2019;s dying words &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Calmer and Calmer</hi>&#x201D; for an inscription; both of which pledges I design to keep with great fidelity as memorials of worthy and kind people.</p>
<p>For my future occupation, I have yet settled nothing definitively. The Booksellers Taylor &#x26; Hessey have offered me &#xa3;100 for a <hi rend="italic">Life of Voltaire</hi> to be composed like this of Schiller; to be printed, if I like, in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; the subsequent editions also to be theirs at the rate of &#xa3;100 apiece. I have not agreed to it; for I expect better things from the Edinburgh Trade; but at the very worst this is in reserve. I think it fair enough to get &#xa3;100 for the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> edition only; but they boggle at this; and besides I like not the men, they are silly people, and &#x201C;Turks in grain.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190414-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1819-04-14">14 April 1819</date></ref>.</note> We shall see by and by. In the first place however, I must settle some place of abode for myself, some scheme of existing in conformity to my medical prescriptions and also of proceeding with my literary employments. The <hi rend="italic">farm</hi> is still my favourite or rather only steady project. A reasonable house is all that I want; with land that would pay <pb id="pg-03-285" n="03:285"/>you for working it. I feel assured that if we could get the matter rightly begun, we might manage it perfectly well. Do you know of any likely farm? Send me off a letter to Birmingham with your ideas on this point: I wish much to hear what you and all the rest think of it. We have fully &#xa3;400 of money; and if I were once fairly settled, I could easily make more. Let us try it manfully, and see if we cannot prosper! I think in twelve months, I might almost be perfectly well. I long to hear what you think.</p>
<p>I have said already that the period of my stay in Birmingham was unsettled: I am partly calculating on ten days or perhaps a fortnight. And as I shall have nothing to employ me with, beyond my riding and regimen, I have devised a plan of occupation, which may turn this leisure to account. There is a Spaniard<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The elder of two Spanish brothers named Sottomayor who had sought refuge in Irving&#x2019;s house and who had taught him Spanish. The elder brother had been an abbot but had become a Protestant and married a woman to whom he had formerly been confessor.</note> here (one of the refugees) who from Catholic has become a Protestant, a very honest shrewd little fellow, between whom and Irving I have had occasion frequently of late of officiate as interpreter (the Sp<supplied>[an]</supplied>iard speaking only French). I have bethought me of turning his skill <supplied>[to]</supplied> account; I have bought a Spanish grammar, and begun yesterday to take lessons from him in his language, which I may repay by giving him lessons in mine. I find it very easy; and design to continue it while in Warwickshire. Before leaving Birmingham, I calculate on being able to read Spanish pretty readily. This is better than entire idleness, into which at present I am too much tempted to fall.</p>
<p>A copy of <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> will reach you thro&#x2019; Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> ere long. It is a very reasonable looking book; and promises to act its part in society very fairly. If I can find nothing better to do, I will write a whole string of such books. Literary fame is a thing which I covet little; but I desire to be <hi rend="italic">working</hi> honestly in my day and generation in this business, which has now become my trade. I make no grain of doubt that in time I shall penetrate the fence that keeps me back, and find the place which is due to me among my fellow men. Some hundreds of stupider people are at this very time doing duty with acceptance in the literature of the time.

<p>Now, my dear Alick, I daresay you have not failed to discover that <pb id="pg-03-286" n="03:286"/>this is the most meagre of letters, and to wonder how I could have written it. The truth is I am sitting here perched up in a crowded parlour, with the worst pen in nature, and all is confusion about me. To write sense is simply impossible. Were it not to calm the affectionate anxieties of my Mother, no cause could have tempted me to write at all. Assure her that I am quite well, and will write better next time if I have occasion to write again. You will write <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi> to Birmingham, or at least send the newspaper instantly, and write directly after, &#x201C;Care of J. Badams Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi>.&#x201D; I need not send my compliments to Father &#x26; Mother and every one at home: the best wishes of my heart are with them always. I will see the whole of them in a few days. Excuse this confusion and hurry: I am in the midst of tumult and distraction, and meant only to tell you that I was well, and <closer><salute>ever your aff<hi rend="italic">e</hi> Brother&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I must seem to you very little worthy of the kind punctuality with which you have attended to my wishes: it is a fortnight since you wrote, and for nearly a month you have heard no whisper of tidings from me. Yet in truth, I am but little to blame. The perversity of circumstances detained me in London till yesterday morning, for the last two weeks in the Orator&#x2019;s house; and tho&#x2019; I well remembered you and your anxieties, I found it next to impossible to take the simplest step for calming them. Twice I attempted writing to you; twice the chaotic tumults of the Orator&#x2019;s hospitable but distracted mansion forbade me to proceed. A third time, almost laughing at my own ineptitude, I took my pen, and determined to tell you, tho&#x2019; but half intelligibly, that I was well and loved you; but just as I had finished the second page of my sheet, a messenger arrived with news that I must <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi> set out on my way homeward, and of course postpone all talk with you till I reached Warwickshire! I came last night; and this morning your dear little letter, after travelling thro&#x2019; Dumfriesshire, hither, then to London and back again, was at last put into my hands. So that I am bound to expedition by a double tie; and tho&#x2019; Badams&#x2019; great chemical tub itself <pb id="pg-03-287" n="03:287"/>(a thing somewhat larger than a parish church) should burst, and overflow the premises with oil of vitriol, I will not rise from this spot, till I have quieted your good heart, and done away with all unpleasant calculations and misgivings on account of me. It is a shame that I should cost you a single moment&#x2019;s pain. How many men are there in England that have such a heart to care for them? To me it is worth more than kingdoms: I were worse than mad, if I did not prize it beyond all earthly things, and consider the duty of providing for its happiness as the soul of all my earthly purposes.</p>
<p>My projected movements, you perceive, have been altogether overturned; far from the danger of surprising you by my presence, I am yet a week from Annandale, and perhaps three weeks from you. The poor Book was ready on my part at the time predicted; but just two days before the appointed time of publication, our Engraver discovered that the plate was incomplete, and could not be <hi rend="italic">properly</hi> rectified in less than a fortnight! As I had myself recommended this man to the job, on the faith of Irving&#x2019;s testimony that he was an indigent <hi rend="italic">genius</hi>, I had nothing for it but to digest my spleen in silence, and to tell the <hi rend="italic">feckless <foreign>speldring</foreign></hi> of a creature [awkward fellow], that as his future reputation depended on the work he was at liberty to do his best and take what time he needed for so doing. I settled with Hessey for my labour; had ten copies done up in their actual state for distribution in London; and so washed my hands of the concern, after exacting a solemn promise that they would lose <hi rend="italic">no</hi> time in forwarding the rest to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. The fortnight is already past and another fortnight to keep it company; yet I left Bull still picking and scraping at his copper, still &#x201C;three days&#x201D; from the end of his labour! So much for the patronage of genius! Yet I suffer willingly; for my purpose was good, and this poor Cockney has actually a meritorious heart; and a meagre, patient tho&#x2019; dejected wife depends upon the scanty produce of his burin. In two weeks from the present date, I calculate that you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> see <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>; sooner I dare not promise. It will do little, I conjecture, to justify your impatience; yet as the first fruit of a mind that is one with yours forever, I know that it will meet a kind reception from you; and with your approbation and my own, the chief part of my wishes in the way of <hi rend="italic">fame</hi> are satisfied. I have not put my name to it; for I desire no place among &#x201C;the mob of gentlemen that write with ease&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221223-TC-DH-01">TC to DH, <date when="1822-12-23">23 Dec. 1822</date></ref>.</note> and if mere selfish ambition <hi rend="italic">were</hi> my motive, I had rather not be named at all, than named among that slender crew, as the author of a lank octavo with so few pretensions. <pb id="pg-03-288" n="03:288"/>I seem to see the secret of these things. Let a man be <hi rend="italic">true</hi> in his intentions and his efforts to fulfil them; and the point is gained, whether he succeed or not! I smile when I hear of people dying of Reviews.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle may be thinking of Keats.</note> What is a reviewer sitting in his critical majesty, but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> man, with the usual modicum of brain, who thinks ill of us or well of us, and tells the Earth that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> thinks so, at the rate of 15 guineas a sheet? The vain pretender, who lives on the breath of others, he may hurt; but to the honest workman who understands the worth and worthlessness of his own performance, he tells nothing that was not far better understood already, or else he tells weak <hi rend="italic">lies</hi>; in both of which cases, his intelligence is one of the simplest things in Nature. Let us always be true! Truth may be mistaken and rejected and trodden down; but like pure gold it cannot be destroyed: after they have crushed it and burnt it and cast it on the waters, they cry out that it is lost, but the imperishable metal remains in its native purity, no particle of it has been changed, and in due time it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be prized and made to bless mankind to all ages. If literature had no evils but false critics, it would be a very manageable thing. By the way, have you seen the last number of the London Magazine? Taylor told me it had a &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">letter to the Reviewer of Meister</hi>&#x2019; by some man from Cambridge.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found. See also <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250122-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1825-01-22">22 Jan.</date></ref></note> I suppose it may be very stupid: but I have not read it, or the criticism it is meant to impugn. Goethe is the Moon and these are penny-dogs; their barking pro or con is chiefly their own concern. I mean to send the venerable Sage a copy of this Schiller: I like him better than any living &#x201C;man of letters,&#x201D; for he is a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, not a <hi rend="italic">dwarf of letters</hi>.</p>
<p>Till this wretched Book of mine arrive in Edinburgh, and be at hand as a reference in my proposals, my own presence there cannot be attended with any tolerably satisfactory result. That consideration has occasioned or facilitated by <supplied>[my]</supplied> loitering till now in the South. Irving wished to have &#x201C;a week of talk&#x201D; with me; and I easily consented to make it two. Do not cease to love him, but do not think of visiting him. I feel sympathy for Irving: he is a true-hearted man at bottom; but beleaguered with imbecillity and folly and difficulty on every side. He has already had many distresses to encounter, and many more are yet laid up for him. But they are lessons which he needs; for prosperity is a thing he cannot do with. Disappointment clips away his vanity, makes real friendship precious to him, and brings out the true manly energy of his own character, which flattery and success never fails to <pb id="pg-03-289" n="03:289"/>pervert into a thousand inconsistencies. I have a new sermon<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">For Missionaries after the Apostolic School. A Series of Orations</hi> (London <date when="1825">1825</date>).</note> of his for your mother and you jointly. Let us not forget to love him; for with all his faults, where shall we find his fellow?</p>
<p>On the whole I have left him and London with regret. I regret London, not for the noisy excitement, which its immensity is ever holding out; these indeed I hate; but for the fraction of true friendship which has been established for me in one or two of its many hearts, and which will keep a certain place there for me now when I am gone. You <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> know Mrs Strachey ere the world is done. She is to correspond with me; she has given me a fine gold pencil with a still finer farewell letter for a memorial! The &#x201C;noble lady&#x201D; too, Mrs Montague, does seem to have a touch of kindness for me, which she has striven by many elegant methods to express: she is a flatterer, but not a cozener intentionally; you shall know her too by and by. When I contrast these things with icy Edinburgh, my heart upbraids the coldness of my true but hard and forbidding fatherland. I will try once more: I will seek for friendship in my own country as for hidden treasure, but if I cannot find it, I will stay no longer there. <hi rend="italic">At</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">hens</hi>]</supplied> is dear to me as the centre of all that is best in Scotland; but in my former state of frightful solitude <supplied>[I]</supplied> will never more abide in it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nous verrons</hi></foreign> [We shall see]!</p>
<p>My present purposes are firm as iron in their object, but still somewhat vague in the matter of their execution. In the country in about a year I expect to have regained my health. That blessed result is still far off, but I now think I distinctly <hi rend="italic">see</hi> it. It seems to depend upon mys<supplied>[elf]</supplied> and what am I, if I have not will enough to suffer any thing or do any thing for such a consu<supplied>[m]</supplied>mation? A few days, I stay with Badams to receive his final precepts; then hasten into Anna<supplied>[n]</supplied>dale to arrange some plan of residence with my Brother and my Mother, for my abode if possible must be my <hi rend="italic">own</hi>. Here I will live as by geometry; &#x201C;exercise and temperance&#x201D; (as the spelling-books have it) shall be my laws, unalterable as those of Fate; I will work with moderation in my calling, and live in the firm hope that useful and happy activity will return to me. Believe it, my darling, our happiness <hi rend="italic">is</hi> in <supplied>[our]</supplied> own hands! Let us arouse the wisdom and good principle and serviceable endowments that are in us; let us lay aside every weight,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 12:1.</note> above all let us utterly break with <hi rend="italic">Vanity and all its poisonous progeny</hi>; and never <pb id="pg-03-290" n="03:290"/>doubt that we shall bless and be blessed in one another. Are we not already rich? Has not each of us a faith in the other? Do we not belong to one another, so that Destiny itself cannot sunder our hearts? Then I say, if we are wise, we <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be happy, in spite of all that can oppose us. It is not in external success, in wealth or fame, or any of the modes of <hi rend="italic">reflected</hi> excitements and solaces to self that the matter lies: it is in being right at heart, in following out the good and true, in limiting our ends to our means, and making our very purposes their own reward. We will try, at any rate; and if there is a Providence that cares for the well-intentioned among his creatures, He will prosper our endeavours.</p>
<p>As to my literary employments, I have still various plans before me. The translation of Schiller I continue to think, might prove a useful enterprize; and with proper encouragement, I am not disinclined to undertake it. Some people have been counselling me to translate Wilhelm Tell (the death of Gessler from it is in <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Book) and have it brought upon the stage in London. Taylor &#x26; Hessey too have made me a sort of offer for a <hi rend="italic">Life of Voltaire</hi> on the same principle as this of Schiller: it might be printed in Edinburgh; they would give &#xa3; 100 for the first edition, provided I would let them have all the other editions (if any) at &#xa3; 130 each. I declined, for the present, disposing of the other editions at all; and here we rest. If I can find nothing better, I may close with their offer: but they are drivelling men, and I love them not. Besides as I wish to live in Edinburgh, it were good that I attempted to form relations there, rather than elsewhere. A few weeks will decide.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I am contented, and better prepared than usual for any sort of fate. In about three weeks, I will have your kiss of welcome! You will hide yourself, will you? Depend on me, for seeking out your haunts! It is the will of Fate, and what can a poor girl do? Submit with a good grace to the unavoidable; and be thankful that <supplied>[it]</supplied> is not worse!&#x2014; I rejoice to hear of your precious gifts in the scolding line. What heavenly music we shall make! What a melodious concord of treble and bass! But you are a good creature in spite of Lady Warrender&#x2019;s,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240121-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1824-01-21">21 Jan. 1824</date></ref>.</note> and I will try to be no more a fool.&#x2014; It is dark; and I must end this miserable letter, which I pray you to forgive its unspeakable ineptitudes, for I have written it in the midst of confusion and hurry. Will you write to Mainhill, in a week after this arrives? I will tell you more particularly of my plans. Do now like a good <foreign>lassie</foreign> as you are. Put <pb id="pg-03-291" n="03:291"/>away these odious Gilchrists if you can; and love me forever. <closer><salute>God bless you, Jane!

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>No piece of news that I have heard for a long time has given me more satisfaction than the intelligence contained in your letter of yesterday. For several weeks I had lived in a total dearth of tidings from you; and both on account of your welfare, and of our mutual projects in the farming line, I had begun to get into the fidgets, and was ready to hasten homewards with many unpleasant imaginations to damp the expected joy of again beholding friends so dear to me. It now appears that all is exactly as it should be: you are proceeding in your usual style at Mainhill; and a dwelling-place upon the summit of Repentance height<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The search for a farm, where Alick might try his skills independently of his father, where Carlyle might retire for a time from the bustle of Edinburgh and London, where the brothers might on a basis economical to them both be reunited again, was ended when Carlyle&#x2019;s father leased for him (at &#xa3;100) from General Matthew Sharpe the &#x201C;neat compact little Farm&#x201D; then called Hoddam (or Hoddom) Hill. Located three miles southwest of Ecclefechan and within viewing distance of Mainhill, it would, perhaps above all, also relieve the crowded condition at those quarters.<lb/><lb/>
Carlyle left Birmingham for home <date when="1825-03-19">19 March</date> and at Whitsunday he, Alick, their mother, Jean, and Janet took occupancy. Alick served as his &#x201C;practical <hi rend="italic">farmer</hi>,&#x201D; and the mother and sisters went about their work, &#x201C;with a little man and ditto maid&#x201D; to help them all. With John down from Edinburgh, with Miss Welsh with them for two weeks in September, the situation was not far short of idyllic. But a misunderstanding with Sharpe finally marred it to some extent. Yet with &#x201C;all its manifold petty troubles,&#x201D; Carlyle wrote years later, &#x201C;this year at Hoddam Hill has a rustic beauty and dignity to me; and lies now like a not ignoble russet-coated Idyll in my memory; one of the quietest on the whole, and perhaps the most triumphantly important of my life&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 177&#x2013;79).<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;No such name <supplied>[as Hoddam Hill]</supplied> can be traced in the books of the Hoddam estate. The place is known as Repentance Hill now, but the Carlyle farm has lost its separate identity and become part of the larger farm of West Trailtrow. What was the farm-house in Carlyle&#x2019;s time is now divided out into dwellings for the ploughmen. &#x2026; This farm-house, which had been built as a residence for the factor on the estate, was more commodious somewhat than Mainhill, yet it was an inadequate home for a family of five grown-up people,&#x201D; J. M. Sloan, <hi rend="italic">The Carlyle Country: With a Study of Carlyle&#x2019;s Life</hi> (London, <date when="1904">1904</date>), pp. 138&#x2013;39.</note> has already been provided for me. This latter incident, <pb id="pg-03-292" n="03:292"/>I confess, was beyond my hopes. I feared we should be obliged, so soon as I arrived, to commence the weary task of farm-hunting; in which, as the season was already far spent, it seemed likely enough that we should fail this year, as we had done last, and the date of my establishment might be postponed for another twelvemonth. Happily all this is obviated. I make no doubt that Blackadder&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The former tenant and factor.</note> place will fit us perfectly: the house, I conjecture, and partly recollect, is one of the best of its kind in the district; and as for the management of the land, knowing your industry and our general resources, I am under no apprehension. Once fairly settled in that elevated position, we shall go on with the greatest <foreign><hi rend="italic">birr</hi></foreign>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Energy or enthusiasm.</note> I want nothing but regularity and care in my diet, with gardening and riding and such like exercise in due proportion, to make an immense improvement in my health; and a few hours spent daily in literary labour will not fail to turn to some account in the way of money; so that between us both, with the true aid of our Mother and the rest, we shall be able to make a bold and steadfast front against the Evil Genius, and in due time, I hope, to lay him prostrate, or cripple him forever. We must try, at any rate; like the far-famed Waffler, we will make an <hi rend="italic">affu&#x2019; struggle</hi>, and I doubt not, we shall prosper.</p>
<p>I expect to see you all in a few days; but in the mean time, let not my absence in the least impede your movements. It is only in the furnishing of two apartments in the <hi rend="italic">house</hi> that I can give you any useful counsel. Proceed, therefore, in laying in your necessary stock and implements, as if you had my express and particular sanction. Get the <hi rend="italic">tack</hi> [lease] or minute of tack drawn out in <hi rend="italic">your own name</hi>; for I am but as a lodger, and should make no figure in the character of one of Hoddam&#x2019;s tenants. The <hi rend="italic">entry</hi>, I suppose, will not take place till Whitsunday; but you will need to commence your ploughings and other preparations without delay. Let not my absence cause you to lose a moment. Take money from the Bank, and transact with it as you see proper. I think two such philosophers should show an <hi rend="italic">example</hi> to the rude boors of Annandale: without &#x201C;farming by the book,&#x201D; I hope we shall make a different thing of it, than a routine clodhopper who thinks the world is bounded by &#x201C;the five parishes&#x201D; would make of it.</p>
<p>My Mother need not be assured of the pleasure I feel in having this prospect of living once more under her superintendance. If she can but be taught to <hi rend="italic">stint</hi> me sufficiently in my victuals, we shall do <pb id="pg-03-293" n="03:293"/>admirably. I calculate on suffering a week or two of <hi rend="italic">extra</hi> pain, before I convince her of the great fact, that the less I eat, the better; the weaker my appetite, the stronger my health. I will put <hi rend="italic">her</hi> too under regimen, and make her &#x201C;as sound as gold&#x201D;!&#x2014; She speaks of knives being cheap in Birmingham; but I fear I am a bad merchant anywhere. The people seem to read in my face that I cannot higgle or beat down their prices; so they almost always overcharge me. Nevertheless I mean to try. But we shall need many things of that domestic sort; and our good Mother shall take a journey to Dumfries, and buy them according to her own sagacity by the lump. It is like a sort of marriage; at least, it is a house-heating! Let us be thankful that we are all to be together; all still spared to be a blessing to each other.</p>
<p>At one time, I counted on being home by the end of this week; but now I think it plain enough that it will be towards the end of next, at soonest. Badams detained me long in London; I have but been here since Monday;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1825-02-28">28 Feb.</date></note> and he left me the day before yesterday, being forced by business to return to Town, which he will not have it in his power to leave for a fortnight. He had no new precept of importance to give me; only additional recommendations of abstemiousness and exercise. He is a kind good fellow: I am here as much at home, as if I were at the fire side of Mainhill. Yesterday Badams wrote me (from amidst the &#x201C;wild beasts of Ephesus.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Cor. 15:32.</note> as he calls the new Mining Companies, with whom he is in constant treaty about some important smelting schemes): he wishes me to stay till his return; but if I cannot, he entreats me to take Taffy (a little fiery corn-fed indefatigable Welsh Pony of his, on which I ride) with all its furniture, for the love of him; to ride home on the little red cantering nag, and use it in my own country for the recovery of my health! Such are the frank hearts I have found in England! I am actually meditating whether I shall not accept this friendly offer. The naggie can canter five and forty miles a day: I might stay and rest myself with Irving Carlyle<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;old schoolfellow of mine, very stupid but very kind, being <hi rend="italic">Curate</hi> there&#x201D; whom Carlyle mentions (but does not name) in <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> (II, 176) as having visited at this time. A letter from Irving Carlyle dated <date when="1825-03-07">7 March</date> cordially invites Carlyle to pay the visit and states that his home &#x201C;Shaw&#x201D; is two miles north of Oldham and that Oldham is six miles east of Manchester. It also mentions George Johnston, &#x201C;Surgeon,&#x201D; brother of James, and his home at Marsden, &#x201C;about eight miles from me.&#x201D;</note> at Oldham; then go thro&#x2019; among the Lakes, or any way I chose. I have bought me a pair of monstrous buckskin mud-boots (spatterdashes that cover the whole <pb id="pg-03-294" n="03:294"/>shoe and extend midway up the thigh) which keep me as warm and clean, as if I were in a drawing room; and little Taffy and I go scouring over all the purlieus of this huge village. Perhaps after all I may decide in favour of the Manchester Coach, which ends the business sooner. At any rate, I shall not stir till Monday or after it. But if I am not home about a week after <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, you may expect another letter from me.</p>
<p>For a day or two I am the less anxious, now that I know you all well, and our future <hi rend="italic">up-putting</hi> decided on. My weary <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> was still &#x201C;three days&#x201D; from publication, when I left London! The useless <hi rend="italic">Kipper</hi> of an Engraver has used me and himself very ill. But he could not help it well, I believe; in recommending him to the job, I meant to serve a worthy and needy man; and I am not sorry for the little injury it has cost me. The Book <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in ten days; and I shall not be long in following it. I must there take measures for the executing of some one of my various literary schemes. Among them all, I shall not fail to hit on something that may do myself and others a little good. The Hesseys and Taylors are a pitiful squad: but if nothing better may be, I can close with their offer. If they vex me, I will write some thing of my own, and send the whole brotherhood to the right and left!</p>
<p>It is not without regret that I leave England; and I cling to the hope of often seeing it again. I have found more kindness in it, than I ever found in any other district of the Earth, except the one that holds my Fathers house. If stony Edinburgh be no better to me than it was, I will shake the dust off my feet<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 10:14.</note> against it, and abide in it no more. My health will return, and then I shall be ready for any scene. There are warm hearts everywhere; but they seem to meet one with greater frankness here. Yesterday I had a letter from Mrs Strachey, which was soon followed by a box containing a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> present of the most superb writing-desk<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This was a gift not, as Carlyle then believed, from Mrs. Strachey, but from Miss Kirkpatrick. See Sanders&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">The Strachey Family</hi>, pp. 132&#x2013;33. It may now be seen at the Arched House, Ecclefechan.</note> I have ever seen! I should think, with its accompaniments, it cannot have cost much less than twenty guineas. I am writing on it at this moment, and design to keep it as a precious memorial all my days. These are things that make me wonder.</p>
<p>I have heard no news from Jack for many days: I partly design to send him a letter to-morrow. He is a hurried off-putting <hi rend="italic">Doilter</hi>; but one of the truest of brothers, and bids fair to be a man of note in his <pb id="pg-03-295" n="03:295"/>day and generation, one that will do discredit to none concerned with him. To-morrow I must write to Dr Brewster about my literary plans; next day, I go and hear Crosbie,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Crosbie. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240811-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1824-08-11">11 Aug. 1824</date></ref>.</note> a Scotch minister (from Dumfries) endeavouring to establish himself, among this gun-boring, button-making people.

<ps><p>I hope my Father approves of all these farming schemes, and will not think of burthening himself farther with Mainhill and its plashy soil, when the lease has expired. If I write again, it will be to him. Meanwhile give my warmest love to every mortal about home, beginning with my trusty Mag and ending with the youngest stay of the house, little Jenny.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Tell my Mother I have a book for her, a present from Irving, which he hopes she will like.&#x2014; The time is done: I must begone.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Having an opportunity of transmitting a letter to London, I will not omit reminding you of my anxious expectation of that weary <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>, of which Bull was the unfortunate engraver.</note> and my confidence in your expedition, if so be that any thing <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> depends on it. Week after week has flitted away; and till the foolish thing is fairly published, and conveyed to Edinburgh, my hands are tied. Do, if you please, be so good as get it sent away! You spoke of Wednesday or Thursday last: <hi rend="italic">is</hi> it then published? If you would send a newspaper containing <hi rend="italic">the</hi> advertisement, or a letter from your own hand, with intelligence that the copies <hi rend="italic">are</hi> shipped for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I should take it very kindly, and be relieved from many doubts. Till Wednesday I am here; after that, my address will be: Mainhill, Ecclefechan, Dumfries-shire. I shall be much obliged to you, if you will take this trouble.</p>
<p>I fear you think me very selfish; and may feel it difficult to forgive all the worrying you have had from first to last about this sorry matter. Yet when you consider how I stand, your irritation will be mitigated. I hope we shall work together <hi rend="italic">again</hi> ere long; and that the business <pb id="pg-03-296" n="03:296"/>may be more wisely arranged than it has been this time. If in any point, I can serve you in Scotland, do not hesitate to apply. <closer><salute>Believe me always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Long before this time, I daresay, you reckoned on seeing me; and as neither I nor the poor Book which has detained me so villainously, have yet made our appearance, you must feel rather at a loss to account for our delay. The mischances of bibliopolic and bibliographic life appear to be innumerable. After fighting with incessant ardour for many months against the drivelling of printers, I imagined that the <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> was at length fairly in readiness, and would be out before the public in two days. I went out to Shooter&#x2019;s Hill to see the Bullers; and on my return, I found&#x2014;that the publication was postponed for <hi rend="italic">three weeks</hi>, the miserable haddock<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The fish epithet in Carlyle is almost always derogatory. Bull is <hi rend="italic">kipper, haddock</hi>, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">speldring</hi></foreign>; and in later years Henry T. Wake, who designed Carlyle&#x2019;s bookplate, was at one bad moment a <hi rend="italic">grampus</hi>. It almost appears as if he reserved such epithets for engravers.</note> of an Engraver having discovered that his plate was not right, or like to be so before that time! To storm and imprecate was vain: I have waited <hi rend="italic">four</hi> weeks in patience; and I know not that the thing is done even yet. It shall be a time and times and half a time before I publish again on such a principle.</p>
<p>As till the arrival of <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> in the North, my own presence there was like to be of little benefit, I was the more easily prevailed upon to come and &#x201C;talk&#x201D; a week or two with Irving, and recreate myself with the friends I had found in England, before I took my leave. I also purposed to come in by Birmingham, and carry with me the ultimate precepts of Badams in regard to the management of my health. In this latter point, I have but been partially successful: I have seen Badams once or twice in London; I came here eight days ago, and staid eight and forty hours in his company; but at the end of that period he was forced away again to Town, and does not hope to get back in less than three weeks. At all events, he had little new to tell me; except that I must continue to <hi rend="italic">abstain</hi> both in the way of food and study. He is a <pb id="pg-03-297" n="03:297"/>kind good fellow; and I could not see him leave me, in his painful quest of cooperation from the &#x201C;wild beasts of Ephesus,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250304-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1825-03-04">4 March</date></ref>.</note> as he calls the new Mining Companies, without feeling that I was parting from a <hi rend="italic">friend</hi>. He has written to me twice since his departure: he insists that I shall take a little pony of his with all its furniture; ride home on it thro&#x2019; the Peak country in Derbyshire, and keep the steed in remembrance of him. It is a ches<supplied>[t]</supplied>nut Welsh animal, sharp-tempered and in high <hi rend="italic">condition</hi>; will canter fifty miles with an ordinary man, and never flinch. I am more than half tempted to accept this kind proposal; knowing as I do that it comes from the heart in a great measure, scarcely at all from the vanity of its honest author. I have written to Oldham to see if Irving Carlyle can give me entertainment for a day or two; if so I really may take little Taffy with me, and come prancing home on it, like some nondescript between a Knight-errant and a jobber! If not, I travel by the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Express</hi>; and in either case, I calculate on being home about this day week. You will have a letter there for me, as soon as you have time: the books <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> now be many days till they reach you; my trunk ought ere this to be in your lodgings, or at least in the Shipping Co. of Leith&#x2019;s warehouse. <hi rend="italic">Has</hi> it yet arrived? It was to come by the Hawk (Cap<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Nisbet), was booked about three weeks ago; and I have the <hi rend="italic">receipt</hi> by me.</p>
<p>You will infer that for the last month or so I have been excessively idle. The same alas! may be predicated of my whole residence in England. Yet I am far from regretting my visit to that frank and hospitable land. I have found friends here; and seen characters and conditions of men that may be useful to me in my future life. I return to Scotland with a far lighter heart than I carried from it: I seem to <hi rend="italic">see through</hi> my perverse destiny, and to be prepared for achieving my deliverance from its evils, or at least taking more advantage of its capabilities. I know not whether Alick has informed you, that we have actually <hi rend="italic">found</hi> a place of abode in Annandale; the farm of Repentance Hill, at present occupied by Blackadder, a pleasant spot, with a house greatly superior to the common run of such establishments. I calculate on setting myself there, for twelve months at least: I will write a certain modicum of prose daily; I will ride and dig, and to a certainty recover a much sounder state of health. In summer thou and I will study together; if we were once fairly settled, I calculate on our being all very comfortable, compared with what we have been. What is there to hinder us? We have hands and heads ready to employ themselves <pb id="pg-03-298" n="03:298"/>in honest labour; we owe no man any thing; we will sit under our goose-berry bush and our saugh <supplied>[willow]</supplied>-tree, and no one shall make us afraid. It is but utterly to banish Vanity with all her hideous Progeny from our hearts and habitations, and the strength that is in us will be sufficient for our wants. Does not the very hen that scratches on the dunghill find herself a place of rest, and happiness such as her hennish nature requires? What then is a man, with all his gifts and proud talents, if he cannot go and do likewise? It is by exorbitancy in his aims or loitering in his fulfilment of them, that he fails of being happy, and useful in the sphere assigned him. Let us be wise and patient, and all will be well.</p>
<p>For My future employments, these must in some degree depend on the Bibliopolical conveniences of Edinburgh. I mean to write to Brewster on the subject, about the time of Schiller&#x2019;s arrival. The delay of that preliminary fills me with bitterness every time I think of it. But it was myself who recommended this spooney of an Engraver; I thought him a needy and meritorious man; and tho&#x2019; after all this waiting his plate will not be worth a doit, I cannot murmur. I have determined to let him have his <hi rend="italic">full time</hi>, for his future fortune depends a good deal on this his first appearance; and then if I see fit, I can cut him forever and a day. The Book will sell, I think; tho&#x2019; Taylor &#x26; Hessey are the most pitiful of all terrestrial Booksellers: they made me a sort of offer about a similar <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of Voltaire; &#xa3; 100 for the first edition; &#xa3; 130 for each following one; the book to be printed in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> if I liked, and at any time I might direct. I did not strike; we higgled on the &#x201C;follo[w]ing&#x201D; editions; these I wished to keep entirely in my own hand. In truth the people displease me, being miserable people; so I took care to leave the bargain open, in such a form that without disgrace I might drop it entirely if a better offer shewed itself, or renew it and conclude it, if not. I am still rather fond of <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x2019;s Works</hi>, tho&#x2019; not by any means tied to that scheme. In fact, I feel a considerable quantity of contempt for all the Booksellers of the Universe: with a little health, I promise myself the pleasure of writing something independent of them, and their pelf-loving speculations. They are bipeds of an erect form,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An anticipation of one of the descendental images in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>. Cf. Plato, <hi rend="italic">Politicus</hi>, 266 E.</note> and speak articulately; therefore they deserve the name of men, and from me at least shall always get it. But for the rest, their thoughts are redolent of &#x201C;solid pudding&#x201D;; they are as the pack-horses of literature, which the Author should direct with a halter and <pb id="pg-03-299" n="03:299"/>a goad, and remunerate with clover and split beans; woe to him if the process is reversed; if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> with a noose about his neck is tied to <hi rend="italic">their</hi> unsightly tail, and made to plash and sprawl along with them, thro&#x2019; every <foreign><hi rend="italic">stank</hi></foreign> [ditch] to which their love of proviant leads them! Better were it to be a downright hairy <foreign><hi rend="italic">cuddy</hi></foreign>, and crop thistles and gorse, with humble unrepining tooth, on any of the commons of this Isle.</p>
<p>I believe, Jack, I told thee many of these things before, in a letter which I have a faint remembrance of having written some weeks before I left London. Thou wilt excuse repititions; for my habitudes have been all broken, and their confusion has extended over every chamber of my inward man. I thought it better to write any thing, than not at all. I long to hear from thee, how thou studyest and farest. I admire and envy thy unbroken diligence, and the proud hopes which lie in solemn majesty before thee. So was it once with me; so, tho&#x2019; chastened and illuminated and humbled by the teaching of Experience, will it be again. Fear nothing: the honest man has nothing to fear. Thou and I have yet many difficulties to encounter; but we have ten times the strength to surmount them all. Let us stand by one another truly, and defy them! How prospers the German anatomy? The medicine, and the general reading? And above all, the honest unpretending but substantial spirit of my Doilter? I have much to hear from you when we meet; much to tell you. Would to Heaven these books would come, that I might see you! Write at any rate, directly and copiously. The image of Edinburgh has grown faint within me: I view it with a mingled feeling of acerbity and affection. If it treat me no better than it did, I will relieve it from my presence forever. The true heart deserves to meet true hearts; the thinking head with minds that think. The <hi rend="italic">Deevil</hi> himself shall not constrain me to tabernacle with students and dominies, nor yet to live in solitude, any more! Hang it! Is the universe bounded by the circuit of the West Kirk parish?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Westerkirk is a parish a few miles north of Ecclefechan.</note> There is a sky and a sun in all parts of the temperate zone: seek and thou shalt find!</p>
<p>Plead my excuse to Murray if you ever see him; and say I hope I helped his pedagogue.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Torrance. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250122-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1825-01-22">22 Jan.</date></ref></note> Murray is a shallow mortal, I daresay; but let us not despise the farthing in the day of penury. How goes the undying Cron? These poor men are stunted by the atmosphere of the North; and here the much beef of the country obfuscates every thing. How few <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> get out of school to the end of their lives! Thomas Campbell <pb id="pg-03-300" n="03:300"/>is yet a <hi rend="italic">Student</hi> of the Glasgow College! Poor &#x201C;Theodoric a domestic tale&#x201D;!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Campbell&#x2019;s poem <hi rend="italic">Theodric</hi> was published in <date when="1824">1824</date>.</note> Neither Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review nor any other creature can save it from the sting of Death. I heard Coleridge <hi rend="italic">tawlk</hi> one night a fortnight since. He took an ounce of snuff, speculated in half intelligible Kantism, and vilipended universal nature, in all her productions, but himself. I will tell thee when we meet. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Tongleg! Write in a week. I am ever thy true Brother,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>[In margins:] I am here with a younger brother of Badams&#x2019;; a good-natured, valetudinarian colour-maker. We do very cannily together. I read books, and now and then make calls. I have begun to lear<supplied>[n]</supplied> Spanish, with one of the Refugees whom I met in London. It seems particularly easy: I will shew thee when we meet.</p>
<p>George Johnstone, it seems, is no longer at Oldham: I have written twice and got no answer. I expect to hear from Irving Carlyle to-morrow. No whisper of the poor Targer? Where on Earth can he be?</p></ps>

A twelvemonth of the most devoted attentions, on your part, will hardly atone for the uneasiness you have occasioned me, one way and another, within the last few weeks. I begin to think the little D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> had some reason after all, for the terrible charge which he brought against you. You <hi rend="italic">are</hi> a most uncertain gentleman. There was I, on the faith of your promises, waiting and waiting for two whole weeks, counting every day and hour, and turning pale at the sound of every coach-horn&#x2014;all for nothing! And it was not illness or any necessity which detained you: you merely staid <hi rend="italic">to talk</hi> with the Orator. <foreign>Eh bien!</foreign> I hope you will not take many fortnights of talk, by the way; or my patience, I am afraid will hardly hold out&#x2014;and woe to thee M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Thomas Carlyle if it does not. However, tho I was sadly disappointed when your letter arrived I am glad (as it has happened) that you did not come when you said. I have been ill ever since and little out of bed; so I could not have been with you tho&#x2019; you had been here. But now that my head is mending again you may come when you like.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-301" n="03:301"/>I never wished so earnestly to see you in my life&#x2014; It seems as if my destiny depended on this visit; and we were now to understand each other for the first time. Heretofore we have never met but amidst the most vexatious impediments&#x2014;in circumstances, when I <hi rend="italic">dared</hi> neither <hi rend="italic">suffer</hi> your confidence, nor show you mine: but now our situation is different; what I dreaded to think of is past; and there are no longer any reasons for reserve betwixt us: on the contrary, there are the strongest reasons for being open and sincere. Would to Heaven all doubts and uncertainties were ended! and that we loved <hi rend="italic">each other</hi> as both of us <hi rend="italic">might</hi> love! How happy, how unspea<supplied>[k]</supplied>ably happy should we be! And what hinders it? nothing but the miserable perversion of my own sentiments&#x2014;it is this which raises up a barrier of separation betwixt us; but for this my whole soul would rush to meet yours, and be one with it for ever! Surely I must be the weakest of creatures! I know where the evil lies, and do nothing to mend it; my existence is a sort of waking night-mare, I see the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> way strait before my eyes,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> way of escape from the disquietudes which pursue me, and I have not power to follow it&#x2014; Yet do not despise me, or altogether despair of me. I hope that, <hi rend="italic">ultimately,</hi> I shall be every thing, anything you wish&#x2014;<foreign>c&#x2019;est ne qu&#x2019;il premier pas qui coute</foreign> [only the first step gives trouble]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Voltaire tells Madame Deffand that one of her bon-mots is quoted in the &#x2018;Notes of &#x201C;La Pucelle&#x2019;&#x201D;: &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Il n&#x2019;y a que le premier pas qui co&#xFB;te.</hi></foreign>&#x2019; It is likely, however, that Miss Welsh found this French proverb in Gibbon. In a note the historian sarcastically writes: &#x2018;The catholic martyr [after being beheaded] had carried his head in his hands a considerable way; yet, on a similar tale, a lady of my acquaintance once observed&#x2014;&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">La distance n&#x2019;y a fait rien; il n&#x2019;y a que le premier pas qui co&#xFB;te.</hi></foreign>&#x201D;&#x2019;&#x2014;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Decline and Fall</hi>,&#x2019; ch.

<p>What a multitude of things I have to ask you and explain to you, which I cannot undertake on paper! And, very possibly when you are come they will all be gone out of my head. It is particularly unfortunate that I never <hi rend="italic">can</hi> talk when I have got any thing to say; and that at all times I can be anything easier than <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>. I have lived so long among people who do not understand me or sympathize with me,&#x2014;been so long accustomed to refrain and disgu<supplied>[i]</supplied>se myself for fear of being laughed at; that I am grown as difficult to come at as a snail in a shell; and what is worse I cannot come out of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> shell when I wish it&#x2014; This dumpling of a highland girl too, will be sadly in the way. I have tried every thing I can think of to make her quarters too hot for <pb id="pg-03-302" n="03:302"/>her; but no coldness or crossness can induce her to decamp. She is quite a Spaniel in her nature; the worse I use her, the more she fawns on me, and follows me. I cannot shake her off for an instant all the day long: and then she annoys me so with her awkward imitation of my dress and manners<supplied>[.]</supplied> For some days past, she has been making the most hideous grimaces that were ever beheld; and when I insisted upon knowing the meaning of them, she told me she was merely trying to turn up <hi rend="italic">her</hi> eyes, as I did mine; it looked so very <hi rend="italic">pooty</hi>! I could hardly keep from beating the creature. You will write immediately? and from <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi> I hope. So you are for living <hi rend="italic">there</hi> now! I do not think you know, Dear, what you would be at&#x2014;at least I am sure <hi rend="italic">I</hi> do not. One day you are for turning Farmer and living in a wilderness: and just when I have pictured to myself the deliciousness of a country-life, Away! you are bent on settling in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (where certainly there are no great conveniences for farming) or if Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> does not answer there is London in reserve. What <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you wish? You will <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> me in a fortnight <hi rend="italic">at furthest,</hi> will you not? I am out of all temper about the book&#x2014;indeed I rather think I will not read a word of it now when it comes. God bless you however</p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I am arrived once more in our Father&#x2019;s house, and down to scribble you a few lines notifying my continued welfare. It is but an hour till post-time; but I am unwilling to keep you waiting for another day.</p>
<p>I left Birmingham, on the roof of the Manchester Coach, on Saturday gone a week; and reached that dingy &#x201C;centre of the cotton trade,&#x201D; about nine o&#x2019;clock the same evening. I had previously <hi rend="italic">exchanged missives</hi> with Irving Carlyle the parson of Oldham; so I removed thither (a distance of eight miles) from the Palace Inn and its thousand bagmen, next day. Irving lives in forlorn lodgings two miles to the north of Oldham, in a desolate hamlet called Shaw, wringing from the hard gripe of Destiny a contented tho&#x2019; scanty existence, in the double capacity of teacher and preacher. He received me like a brother; and tho&#x2019; his landlady was a sooty woman, and apparently a Fury in temper, I contrived to spend one night in his establishment with <pb id="pg-03-303" n="03:303"/>tolerable comfort. In head Irving is utterly addle; but he has a kind honest heart; and nature has taught him many valuable lessons in Philosophy, which Art could never yet teach me. I liked my humble countryman far better than I have done wiser men. From Irving I learned that George Johnstone had lately made an attempt, and then abandoned it, to settle in Oldham; and was now living with his Mother at Marsden, on the Yorkshire side of the &#x201C;great spine of England,&#x201D; as they call the chain of dry moory hills which there divide the two counties. The distance was said to be 8 miles; Irving and I were 4&#xBD; hours in travelling it. After wandering over an elevated grim looking wilderness, the rapid water-courses of which were sparingly besprinkled with cottages and cloth-weavers, with here and there a coal-mine or spinning-mill, and smoky villages far in the distance; we at length descried the hamlet of Marsden, nestled in the lap of the mountains, and ere long were snugly seated in the Doctor&#x2019;s parlour. Both he and his mother gave me such a cordial welcome, that I postponed my purpose of departure for two days; which I spent in roaming up and down among the foundries and cloth-works, and cottages of the neighbourhood. The place is literally an immense mountain cauldron; at the bottom of it five or six brooks unite to form the Aire (I think), which escapes by another valley towards Huddersfield on the north-east, and finally falls into the Humber. The bottom, and the hill-sides as far as culture has subdued the heath, are studded with houses and cottages, connected with the bottom by steep flagstone paths; the people are a fat people; you see the tall chimneys of manufacturing engines towering up in the solitude of the moors, a spot of life in the vast circuit of the dead waste; and altogether the effect is Swiss-looking and agreeable. George has <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the practice which the place affords; in point of employment, abundance; in point of emolument, somewhere about two hundred a year. Living is high, so that he cannot save much; but he does save a little, with which in two years he means to visit Paris, and then establish himself in some wider and more inspiring scene. Meanwhile he seems to be gathering a little knowledge, and to feel entirely contented. He is a well-meaning shrewd fellow; considerably the best medical production of our native village. I cautioned him against the contaminating influences of Marsden; encouraged him with sympathy and lecturing, and promised by and by to write to him. He wishes much to hear of you: write him a letter as soon as you have time. His Mother is well, but not contented with the unsociality of the people; she was kind to me as to a son, and almost cried when I came <pb id="pg-03-304" n="03:304"/>away. On the whole, I feel a great interest in these worthy unpretending people; and should rejoice to hear of their prosperity. I wish you <hi rend="italic">would</hi> write, whenever you have leisure.</p>
<p>I reached Mainhill on Saturday last, by the Carlisle Mail, without any particular inconvenience except a slight derangement in &#x201C;the biliary ducts,&#x201D; and a pitiful snivelling cold which I had contracted by two successive days of <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> travelling. Great things have been accomplished here of late. They have rented Repentance Hill as a farm for me, at &#xa3;100 a year; Alick is there ploughing even now; they are about hiring servants, and all is to go on swimmingly. I go over this afternoon to inspect the place; of which, in so far as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am concerned, every report speaks favourably. Alick on his own side is also full of hopes. I rejoice in the prospect of a comfortable home, where I may at length commence my plans of regimen, and live like a wise man. In summer, you will find a better domicilium also, than you have had: there will be freedom and fresh air and quiet, and brotherly affection for us all. I do anticipate no small improvement in our circumstances from this new arrangement. It will depend upon ourselves, whether we are comfortable and industrious, and more or less rapidly progressive in our several pursuits.</p>
<p>Meantime till Whitsunday, we do not get possession of the house; the intermediate period must be spent in making preparations. The first, and not the easiest for me, relates to my literary employment, about which I have so often troubled you of late. <hi rend="italic">Is</hi> that Book arrived? I scarcely hope it; so many delays have inspired me with distrust. Write to me instantly: if the <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> is among you, there is nothing here to detain me beyond a day or two from seeing you. At all events you can ask Boyd, in what state of progress it is. I have had such bustling and bungling with that pitiful transaction, as has quite disgusted me. You will send a copy to Brewster, and two to Mrs Welsh of Haddington: the rest you can keep till I come.</p>
<p>I mean to write to Brewster by this post. Alick tells me you want a little money; and I bethink me of a plan for supplying you. Brewster owes me the price of various Translations<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chiefly Carlyle&#x2019;s translation of Sismondi&#x2019;s article on &#x201C;Political Economy.&#x201D;</note> in his Encyclopedia, a sum perhaps of fifteen pounds; which has been due three or four months, and which he long ago directed me to bid <hi rend="italic">any one</hi> call for at his house. Do you go and call, any morning between eleven and one o&#x2019;clock; I will add a postscript to his letter as a harbinger; you will both see the <foreign><hi rend="italic">savant</hi></foreign>, and get your cash from him with the greatest <pb id="pg-03-305" n="03:305"/>readiness. Observe this: it is needless for you to be short of money for a day; and this is the easiest method of furnishing you.</p>
<p>I have already missed the post, the herd-boy having gone to Bonshaw<supplied>[&#x2026;]</supplied> hiring a farm-servant. You must wait with patience for another day; and I <supplied>[will]</supplied> not close this sheet till to-morrow morning. I have thus got farther leisure; bu<supplied>[t I]</supplied> cannot occupy it to much purpose in the way of scribbling; for the day is brilliant, and every nerve in me is chacing me forth into the sunshine. At any rate what need is there? I have already told thee the necessary as to business; and for the rest, we are all well here (except Jenny who is fast recovering from <hi rend="italic">the</hi> measles), and all as true in our affection to the mighty Tongleg as we have ever been. Especially the colony of Repentance Hill expect much true enjoyment from his presence with them in a month or two. Thou art diligent as formerly: continue so, and cast away despondency. It is a natural feeling, but a thriftless one, and in thy case quite unfounded. Hast thou not a head and a heart? I tell thee, thou art fated to be a <foreign><hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;decin malgr&#xE9; lui</hi></foreign>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A doctor in spite of himself. A playful reference to Moli&#xE8;re&#x2019;s play with this title (<date when="1666">1666</date>).</note> of notability in thy day and generation. Confide in me as in a friend that will <hi rend="italic">never</hi> fail thee; as I too confide in thee.</p>
<p>So far are we from repenting having made thee a &#x201C;scholar,&#x201D; that there is even a serious purpose arising, in my imagination if not my judgement, of ed<hi rend="italic">icatting</hi> another of the family. Jean has gained immortal laurels by parsing with Ben Rae; she seems I think to have outstripped her teacher considerably in Knowledge of grammar, and I am told that she is &#x201C;no worth a <foreign>preen</foreign> [pin] for wark.&#x201D; She <hi rend="italic">is</hi> in fact a kind of genius, and I grudge to see her rare talents lying wild and unemployed. We shall seriously consider of it. She is to go with us to Repentance at all events.&#x2014; For external news I scarcely know a syllable worth writing. The wretched inhabitants of <hi rend="italic">the village</hi> looked as squalid, and appear to be as brutish and unhappy as when I left them. It is a serious evil to live within the <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> of their base doings; one is degraded by having any trade however small with them. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Also nichts davon</hi></foreign> [Therefore, nothing more about this]. Waugh, I hear, is in a terrible pucker for money: <hi rend="italic">Richie Uirin</hi> has had him under arrest, for bond-bills upon <hi rend="italic">the</hi> property. I will see Waugh in a day or two. The pony is here, a stiff substantial brute, tho&#x2019; Waugh&#x2019;s ostler has starved it, and Waugh himself has changed its pace into that particular species of trot, which my father would denominate a <foreign><hi rend="italic">flatch</hi></foreign>[a clumsy walk]. I will remodel it.&#x2014; Jemmy Bogs has left his place&#x2014;by moonlight; the <pb id="pg-03-306" n="03:306"/>dirty scullion! Tom is with his father in <hi rend="italic">Poverty-raw</hi>; eating opium, and practising upon the bodies of the indigent and afflicted. Taylor of Lockerby appeared in his pulpit, the Sunday before last, so <hi rend="italic">drunk</hi> that he could not preach: I do pity the unlucky mortal from the bottom of my heart. These are <hi rend="italic">news</hi> for you: are we not a happy people in this Annandale? <closer><salute>I will not write another word; except to bid <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> write by the very first post, and to assure thee that I am ever,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Thy affectionate Brother, /</salute></closer>

<ps><p>(The trunk is come in safety. Send home the leather-cap, if Farries c<supplied>[ome]</supplied> before me)</p>
<p>I have begun Brewster&#x2019;s letter; if possible I will finish it by this post, at all events by the next. The Book, it seems, <hi rend="italic">was</hi> shipped from London a week ago;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A letter from John Bull to Carlyle dated <date when="1825-03-18">18 March</date> states that <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> was finally published and that copies were sent to Edinburgh on <date when="1825-03-16">16 March</date>.</note> it must be arrived among you ere now.

<dateline><place>Mainhill</place>, <date when="1825-03-23">23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> March, 1825</date>.</dateline>
<p>Thanks, My Dearest, for the letter which lay waiting me, and still more for the <hi rend="italic">severe affection</hi>, which it recorded and formed proof of. I perceive I must by and by begin to respect you in a new capacity, that of a self-denying meek philosopher: the patience you have displayed of late is really altogether exemplary. I do not know that I myself, philosopher by trade, could have displayed such tolerance to you, a much more <hi rend="italic">tolerable</hi> person, had I figured your conduct to be half so fluctuating and irregular as you consider mine. In time, as you say, I hope all things of you.</p>
<p>I do not reckon your Doctor at all a deep <foreign><hi rend="italic">Seelenforscher</hi></foreign> [psychologist]; yet it is possible enough that in my case he may have some degree of reason for his accusation. Between deciding slowly and correctly, and deciding rapidly and wrong, there is a strict mathematical line of propriety, as between every two extremes of habit; and whether I am travelling steadily along this line, is a thing which often gives me more than doubt. Yet slowness of decision is an evil; as <hi rend="italic">in</hi>decision <pb id="pg-03-307" n="03:307"/>or the incapacity of <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> deciding firmly is the great bane of life, the fatal deficit which wrecks the character and happiness of millions. Fortunately, however, in the present instance, I have escaped this misery; it is less in my procedure than in my manner of describing it that your charge is grounded. My scheme of action was determined on, with as little loitering as consisted with what I thought mature deliberation; and it has been advancing, ever since, towards fulfilment, as steadily as the perversity of circumstances, chiefly depending upon other people, would permit. What a fool you must think me, with this imaginary plan of taking up my residence in Edinburgh! No, my dear Counsellor! towered cities, with their hideous tumult and contamination, are a horror to me, till my health is reestablished. To live in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is a project as yet dubious and far off: it is only with the literature of Edinburgh that I wish to be connected, and to hold communication, at a safe distance of seventy statute miles, till my present and most pressing object is attained. Then, indeed, London and Edinburgh and &#x201C;all places that the eye of Heaven visits&#x201D; are to me &#x201C;ports and happy havens&#x201D;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Shakespeare&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi>, I, iii.</note> I can turn whither circumstances may direct me; tho&#x2019; if nothing special should occur to change my way of life and business, I had rather for many reasons carry it on in my native country than in any other. &#x201C;O immaculate genius!&#x201D; I hear you exclaim; &#x201C;and why didst thou linger talking with the orator, or dawdling in the sooty purlieus of Brummagem and Manchester, wasting precious time, and suffering all thy purposes, wise or foolish, to stagnate uncommenced? O faultless monster, wherefore didst thou this?&#x201D; Fair and softly, my Dear! things are not as they seem. With my utmost exertions, I know not but that I am yet too soon for doing any business in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and as to other business, I assure you much has been accomplished already. This very morning, they awoke me with the tumult of loading carts with apparatus for Hoddam Hill, a <hi rend="italic">farm</hi> of which I, or Brother Alick for me, am actually tenant! Think of this, and reverence my <foreign><hi rend="italic">savoir-faire!</hi></foreign> I have been to see the place (secured for me in my absence); and I like it well, so far as I am interested in it. There is a good house, where I may establish myself in comfortable quarters; the views from it are superb; there are hard smooth roads to gallop on towards any point of the compass; and ample space to dig and prune, under the pure canopy of a wholesome sky. The ancient Tower of <hi rend="italic">Repentance</hi> stands on a corner of the farm; a fit memorial for reflecting sinners. My Mother and two little sisters go with us at Whitsunday; we expect to <pb id="pg-03-308" n="03:308"/>manage well. Here then will I establish my home, till I have conquered the fiend that harrasses me; and afterwards my place of retreat, till some more suitable one shall come within my reach. I have estimated the good and the evil of the undertaking as correctly as I could: the former seems distinctly to preponderate; and the philosopher has nothing more to do but study to conquer or forget the latter.</p>
<p>So, my Dearest, you must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> revoke your approbation of a rural life; for your sanction of my schemes is a thing which I require for prosecuting them with spirit. Like you I look forward with anxiety and impatience to our meeting: much must be considered then, much must be determined. It behoves us to think calmly of our affairs, and these are affairs on which it is difficult to think with calmness. Let us try, however; the period of romance and extravagance should now be past with us; it is only clear judgement guided by prudence and integrity that can carry us thro&#x2019; in safety. Meanwhile, my Dearest, let not your kind heart be troubled.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201223-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1820-12-23">23 Dec. 1820</date></ref>.</note> The chaos of circumstances still lies before you to order as you please. Consider me and all that I have and am as altogether yours, to take or to reject, according to your will. Choose in your fortune the path that promises most plausibly to lead you to happiness, and true not seeming honour, and count on me and all my humble stock of resources to aid you to the uttermost in pursuiing it. This is not mere cant: I feel and ought to feel in this manner. Since the earliest period of our intercourse, your part has been kindness and generosity, and forgetfulness of many petty things which another would have remembered: my part has been little more than vain wishes for your welfare; and these, however vain, I mean to keep with me and endeavour with such success as shall be granted me to accomplish, so long as there is any hope or use in entertaining them. After all, I do not see that there is any room for desperation. Each of us, I believe, would regard it as the highest happiness of our union to make the other happy: we are both honest creatures, and love each other honestly: it is strange if our combined understanding, faithfully and disinterestedly applied to our concerns, will not direct us safely thro&#x2019; their intricacies. It is necessary, as you say, and every way fit that we should now communicate unreservedly. Hitherto even in each other&#x2019;s company, we have seen each other thro&#x2019; a glass darkly;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Cor. 13:12.</note> steering carefully amid pitiful perplexities which locked up our confidence, and gathering each other&#x2019;s sentiments from faint and dubious indications. <pb id="pg-03-309" n="03:309"/>Let us now see each other face to face! There want<supplied>[s only a]</supplied> full and frank explanation of our purposes and situations, the free light of day to be t<supplied>[hrown]</supplied> over every corner of our circumstances; and the right path thro&#x2019; them cannot fail to <supplied>[appear.]</supplied> Dread nothing, my own Jane! Which of us is the selfish in heart? Neither. Which of us is the blind and prejudiced in judgement? Neither. What then do we fear? The strength or the weakness of our <hi rend="italic">means</hi> is nothing to our happiness, if it be rightly estimated, and managed. The sparrow on the houseeaves is happy; yet its means are very small.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240927-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1824-09-27">27 Sept. 1824</date></ref>.</note> Let us but abjure <hi rend="italic">vanity</hi> [underscored twice], the head and front of mortal sin and misery; let us utterly declare war against it in all its branches, and hunt it from our spirits; and believe me, the rest is easy. At all events let us <hi rend="italic">love one another to the end!</hi> I often think of losing you, and how my patience would support it: but I trust the experiment will not be tried on me.</p>
<p>I wait for letters from Edinburgh to appoint my setting out: I calculate on being there next week; I will write to you whenever I arrive. Have you actually got <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Book, and refused to open it? I declare I myself feel almost of your humour: these unfortunate persons drivelled and dallyed about it so long, that it is almost a pain to me to think of aught connected with them. Nevertheless let us learn to be patient, and that the Universe was made for others as well as for us! Next publishing, I hope we shall lose less time.&#x2014; I can easily appreciate your multiplied anxieties and disappointments; but you will forgive me, the innocent or guilty cause of them, me whom you have already forgiven so much. We <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> meet at last; and in return for my delays and failures, I will stay with you <hi rend="italic">as long as you will let me</hi>. Am not I a generous youth? Upon my honesty, you do me injustice: I am like other blessings, you will never know the worth of me till you have lost me. <hi rend="italic">Will</hi> not that &#x201C;dumpling of a girl&#x201D; begone? I pity you, and may soon pity myself, with her. And yet poor &#x201C;dumpling&#x201D;! She must live as well as others.&#x2014; I could find you a far better pupil than this Highlander, if you felt didactically inclined. The little poetess<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean (Jane) Carlyle.</note> is grown a tall girl (I was two years mistaken in her age), and bids fair to be a genius in good earnest! She has gained unfading honours here by extracting a very tolerable knowledge of arithmetic and grammar from the schoolmaster of the village; a miracle scarcely inferior to that of Moses when he drew water from the face of the thirsty whinstone. <pb id="pg-03-310" n="03:310"/>In fact the creature has fine faculties, and a true honourable spirit: it seems to me, at times, a pity that such a mind should be expended on baking and churning. I am seriously meditating to take charge of her myself. On the day of my return, she came running bare-headed from her school in the village to investigate the loading of the coach; I pulled down the window, and her face grew scarlet: I liked the creature.</p>
<p>Write to me, if you have time within a week: if not I will write on my arrival. God bless you, Dearest! <closer><salute>I am ever yours,</salute></closer></p>
<name>Th: Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Is your head recovered? What a monster is this Headache! Was it study or cold or accident that brought it on? I pray you for Heaven&#x2019;s sake to take care. Ill health is the evil which above all others I have dreaded for you; I would not for the whole universe that you should be as I am. No, no! That must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be! Send the dumpling away, and be a good girl, and all will be well.</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I arrived here on Friday evening, jaded and fevered by a day of multifarious and disagreeable travelling: I meant to write to you on Saturday; but the tedious perplexities of certain Jewish Booksellers detained me, too little heedful of the flight of time, till the last Haddington Coach had departed. I have yet made no agreement, and intend to make none till I have more accurately seen my way thro&#x2019; matters: <pb id="pg-03-311" n="03:311"/>but to-morrow I shall have farther consultations; and after that, the moment you write to me, I shall hasten to the blessed East.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blumine in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> has important associations with the East, often suggesting Kitty Kirkpatrick and her Begum mother. It is worth noting, however, that Jane Welsh also has an association with the East in Carlyle&#x2019;s mind, not the Orient but eastern Scotland where Haddington is, good enough for Carlyle&#x2019;s symbolism.</note> If this parcel be honestly delivered, you will still have time to write by the post on Monday; your letter will reach me here on Tuesday at eleven o&#x2019;clock, and that same evening I shall be at your side! Do not delay one instant, if you are a good girl: I long to see your kind face once again lighted up with satisfaction in my presence. Be good, and write directly, if your Mother will permit. I shall wait with no ordinary impatience for the coming of the postman: heaven grant he may bring me favourable tidings, that we may meet again in affection, and spend the little space allotted us as our hearts and reason wish it should be spent!&#x2014; Write instantly; and if Tuesday will not do, say what day will, and reckon on me then.&#x2014; Good night, my Dearest! &#x201C;Come to my dreams,&#x201D; and annihilate the space and the difficulties that divide us! God bless you! <closer><salute>I am ever yours,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Well! young Gentleman,</salute> you are coming <hi rend="italic">at last</hi> (you say). After so <hi rend="italic">many</hi> disappointments, may I depend on you? Really, you do well to extol my miraculous gift of patience&#x2014;if I had merely an ordinary share of it, I should certainly have said good by to you, for keeping me so long in this uncomfortable state of expectation.</p>
<p>But you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> coming at last&#x2014; Would to Heaven that you were already come!

<salute>My dearest Eliza</salute>
<p>I do not think anyone can accuse <hi rend="italic">me</hi> of idle letterwriting&#x2014;or you either, if I may judge from my own experience. Well! &#x201C;charity&#x201D; (they say) &#x201C;may exist without giving of alms,&#x201D; and friendship without the expressing of it by letters: so there is no great need for either apologizing or finding fault. I write to you when I have got any thing to say; and am grateful for your letters when you are pleased to write them.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-313" n="03:313"/>On the present occasion I have got something to say with a vengeance!

M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> B&#x2019;s sojourn in this quarter is very agreeable to me, however, in one respect&#x2014;it affords me opportunities of repaying that <hi rend="italic">memorable bow</hi>, with courtesies after a similar fashion&#x2014; Oh! it would have done your heart good to have seen how I received him. It was half dark when he came; my Mother and Catherine were working at the window; and I was talking with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle by the fireside; conceive my astonishment at so unlooked for an apparition! <hi rend="italic">Himself</hi> suddenly stood before me, all smiles and cordiality, and held out his hand; I opened my eyes very wide, but my heart beat no faster; I rose deliberately from my seat and made him such a decidedly ceremonious courtesy, that I almost threw myself off my balance&#x2014; He looked&#x2014;just as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> did when he passed me on the Waterloo-bridge&#x2014;and I felt that I was revenged! He was come, he said, to reside among us for some time, to recruit his strength, he had been ill&#x2014;confined to bed for three months&#x2014;it was necessary that he should leave town, and his acquaintance with us and D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fyffe had induced him to fix on Haddington as the place of his retreat&#x2014; How d&#x2014;d odd!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Capt.

I suspect he will soon be convalescent <pb id="pg-03-314" n="03:314"/>enough to return to the city. What a winding up of our Romance!

<p><salute>Alas, my dearest!</salute> there is no hope of my getting out to-night or even to-morrow. Business proceeds with a snail&#x2019;s pace; and without making some injudicious conclusion of it, I see not how I can be free for several days to come. I had determined on communicating with Lockhart before making any final bargain; I declined taking Brewster&#x2019;s introduction by way of letter; and the active Doctor writes me that yesterday he could not find the critic at home. Today I hope he will be luckier; if not I shall in all probability proceed with the Taits and their &#x201C;select novel&#x201D; speculation, on my own private footing. I put no jot of faith in any one of these people: <foreign><hi rend="italic">das Hunger treibt sie</hi></foreign> [hunger compels them], they stare with incredulous vacuity when any better purpose is hinted at. If Lockhart have no better stuff in him (which is improbable enough) than such unhappy drudges, his intimacy tho&#x2019; it came unasked for would do little for me. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nous verrons</hi></foreign> [We shall see]. The Doctor is all awake about his &#x201C;literary newspaper&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brewster proposed a journal, to be published by Tait and edited by Brewster, Carlyle, and Lockhart. It never reached publication, partly because of Lockhart&#x2019;s appointment as editor of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi>. See Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, I, 381&#x2013;82.</note> Lockhart and I are to take the Belles Letters department, he the scientific, and together we shall beat the world! I have no belief in this, and little inclination to make trial of it, none at all <hi rend="italic">at present</hi><supplied>[.]</supplied> The Doctor is a needy man; with &#xa3; 1000 a-year, it is still true <foreign><hi rend="italic">das Hunger treibt ihn</hi></foreign> <supplied>[him]</supplied>. He thinks I may be profitable to him; and strives to be obliging. He advises me, and runs and stirs for me, wherever I request. On Saturday he gave me ingress to the most inane of scientific dinners; envious <foreign><hi rend="italic">philosophuli</hi></foreign>, withered Blues, and French confectionery! Yet the very shew of friendship has its value, especially in this most sceptical and meagre of terrestrial cities. I thank God that I care no doit for its scepticism and cold frivolity: sympathy and love await me elsewhere; and I doubt not for a moment that the honest exertion of the honest faculties which nature and industry have given us will lead us ultimately to the happy&#x2014;undivided, as it ever must be, from the good and the true.</p>
<p>This dealing with the <hi rend="italic">Beasts of Ephesus</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250304-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1825-03-04">4 March</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250307-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1825-03-07">7 March</date></ref>.</note> will render Haddington the welcomer to me when I reach it. Let me not regret delays: I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> have my full period of your society, come what may. The third of our <pb id="pg-03-316" n="03:316"/>story is not told yet; and I feel that the more we explain, we shall like each other the more trustfully and dearly. I am already twice as happy in you as I was. Let us believe in virtue and reason and one another, and fear nothing that can befal us!</p>
<p>Meanwhile I have sent you this book of Schiller&#x2019;s, in which you are to study at my return. Go on with your tasks, <hi rend="italic">especially the last</hi>, and I will hasten out to see you, the first instant I am free. I fear it will be friday or saturday; and what is more disagreeable, I cannot with any certainty appoint the day. Be patient, and never expect me till I stand beside you, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Brust an Brust und Lipp&#x2019; auf Lippe</hi></foreign> [breast to breast and lip to lip].<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, I, Scene 18, &#x201C;Martha&#x2019;s Garden&#x201D; (l. 3504): &#x201C;Brust an Brust und Seel&#x2019; in Seele.&#x201D; They are Faust&#x2019;s impassioned words to Gretchen.</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Knowing by repeated experience your readiness to oblige, I make no scruple of applying to you in the present emergency; more especially as it relates to a department of business, in which you take a deep interest for its own sake.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-317" n="03:317"/>
I have engaged with an Edinburgh Bookseller to prepare three or four volumes of Translations from the German intended as Specimens of their chief novel-writers, with Prefaces, Lives, and Criticisms, and all the <foreign><hi rend="italic">addenda</hi></foreign>, which may serve to procure them a good-natured reception from the English public. My acquaintance with this branch of German literature is small, for it does not stand by any means in the highest favour with me; yet I calculate pretty confidently on being able to select a handful of sound wheat from the loads of chaff which I have yet examined only on the surface; and being naturally anxious to effect this as perfectly as possible, I have determined on soliciting the benefit of your knowledge and taste to aid me in my choice. The Bookseller leaves me unlimited freedom; he has no information on the subject, and few counsellors by whose light it were safe to walk. So far as I can judge, his chief dependance seems to be on the <foreign><hi rend="italic">V&#xF6;lksm&#xE4;hrchen</hi></foreign> [folk tales] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Rittererz&#xE4;hlungen</hi></foreign> [romances of chivalry] of our neighbours; on Mus&#xE4;us, La Motte Fouqu&#xE9;, Lafontaine,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251103-TC-WT-01">TC to WT, <date when="1825-11-03">3 Nov.</date></ref></note> and the other &#x201C;mob of gentlemen&#x201D; who write for the venerable <hi rend="italic">Plebs</hi> of the reading community. I dislike these people, but must not altogether neglect them. For the sake of popularity independent of merit, I must try to get a specimen or two from each of these notable personages; but my chief dependance is placed on Tieck, Richter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Paul Friedrich Richter (<date when="1763">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825">1825</date>), <hi rend="italic">Blumen-, Frucht-, und Dornenst&#xfc;cke</hi>, 3 vols.

Wieland was called &#x201C;the German Voltaire.&#x201D;</note> or elsewhere; valuable more for its author&#x2019;s than its own qualities, but giving room for some discussion on <hi rend="italic">that</hi> topic and therefore useful for me. Of Richter I yet know little; I have looked into his <hi rend="italic">Herbst-Bluminen</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Herbst-blumine oder gesammelte Werkchen aus Zettschriften</hi> (T&#xfc;bingen, <date when="1810">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820">20</date>).</note> his <hi rend="italic">Flegeljahre</hi>, and am now reading his <hi rend="italic">Fibel</hi>. It is easy to see already that next to Goethe (and Tieck?) he is the best man in Germany: but his extravagance and barbarism will render the task of selecting from him one of some difficulty. The <hi rend="italic">Phantasien</hi> which you lent me are all I know of Tieck; but I must if possible have him included in my list, and some of his smaller tales I hope will give me the opportunity. There is also one Hoffman whose <pb id="pg-03-318" n="03:318"/><hi rend="italic">Elixiere des Teufels</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann (<date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822">1822</date>), German composer and writer. <hi rend="italic">Die Elixiere des Teufels</hi> (<date when="1816">1816</date>).</note> was translated last year in Edinburgh (with small success), concerning whom I could like to have some farther information. As to <hi rend="italic">Claurens</hi> with his <hi rend="italic">Scherz und Ernst</hi>,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heinrich Clauren (Karl Gottlieb Samuel Heun) (<date when="1771">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854">1854</date>), <hi rend="italic">Scherz und Ernst</hi>, 4 vols. (<date when="1820">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828">28</date>).</note> I have got the book beside me, but put no faith in it.</p>
<p>Now, my dear Sir, could you &#x201C;of your own knowledge,&#x201D; or by consulting with any of your German friends, afford me advice in this matter? Could you learn for me which is Lafontaine&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">best</hi> novel in one moderate volume? I have read his Raphael (in French), his <hi rend="italic">Rudolph von Werdenberg</hi>, and his <hi rend="italic">Tinchen</hi> (in German): there is genius in all of these; but whether any of them is among the best of his half-a-century of works, I have no means of ascertaining. Do you know the character of his <hi rend="italic">Sagen aus dem Alterthume</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">kleine Romane</hi>?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Auguste Heinrich Julius Lafontaine (<date when="1758">1758</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831">1831</date>), <hi rend="italic">Raphael</hi> (<date when="1810">1810</date>), <hi rend="italic">Rudolph von Werdenberg</hi> (<date when="1800">1800</date>), <hi rend="italic">Tinchen oder die M&#xE4;nnerprobe</hi> (<date when="1811">1811</date>), <hi rend="italic">Kleine Romane</hi> (<date when="1799">1799</date> and <date when="1807">1807</date>).</note> Which is Tieck&#x2019;s best novel? La Motte Fouqu&#xE9;&#x2019;s best novel or novels of the small sort? Is it <hi rend="italic">Ondine</hi>? This they wish me to translate, thinking it badly done at present: but after reading the original, I despise it a good deal.

<p>In Edinburgh are several handsome collections of German Books, to most or all of which I have obtained or shall obtain access; particularly to that in the Advocates Library, one of the most numerous if not the best selected in the kingdom. Still the quantity of books I shall have access to, compared with the quantity I should wish to read before making a final choice, is inconsiderable; and as buying on the great scale is out of the question, I am anxious to have the range of my examination narrowed before commencing. For this purpose I put no small trust in you. I doubt not you will give me minutely your own thoughts on the matter; and transmit me those of your German friends in whose judgement you most rely.

This seems a strange proposal: but when I look at your Don Quixote and Quevedo,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francisco Gomez de Quevedo y Villegas (<date when="1580">1580</date>&#x2013;<date when="1645">1645</date>), Spanish author of picaresque romances.</note> I hardly think it stranger than your kindness of disposition. At all events I count on your favouring me with your advice, the first hour you have leisure. I make no apology for the trouble I am giving you; but I hope I shall not feel the <hi rend="italic">obligation of it</hi> the less on that account. If you write within a week after this arrives (which would be very desirable), please to direct to No 18. Salisbury-street, Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>: if not till after that, it will be safer to say: Mainhill, Ecclefechan, Dumfries-shire, where I am to be all summer.</p>
<p>In a short while I mean to send you one of those <hi rend="italic">Schillers</hi> that you may send it to Goethe: then, I shall try to write less drily. At present I must stick to the naked point of business; and even this I can hardly yet handle in intelligible terms: crowds of people are about me, hurrying me, and crossing me.

<dateline><place>24. Salisbury-street</place>, Friday-morning. [<date when="1825-05-06">6 May 1825</date>]</dateline>
<p><salute><foreign>Meine Herzensliebste</foreign> [My Sweetheart]!</salute> I cannot take to any work till I have written you a letter: and yet except that I am sad and sick in heart at parting with you, I know not aught I have to say. Even this might be supposed without saying it; to have parted with you in so dreary and constrained a mood would have sickened a heart still harder than mine. O My Dearest! I boasted of being grown a Stoic, and I find there are things which could make a girl of me yet. Ever since I left you, the farewell, which I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not imprint upon your lips, has been sounding in melancholy tones thro&#x2019; my inmost soul. Last night I opened Goethe; but his wisdom to me was foolishness; I could do nothing but gaze into the fire, or listen to the tempest, and keep recounting all the tender things I should have said to you, all the harsh ones I should have suppressed, and picturing, on the most sable canvas, past and future images of weeping, thwarted love. Sometimes I fancied our parting ominous; that you would die, and I should never see you more! O God! If Thou wouldst not&#x2014; But there is no use in this, it is all a dream.</p>
<p>I have looked at your paper, and secured it as my choicest treasure. If you have not the gift of speaking with the voice, you can speak with your actions to the very core of the heart. This little token is mine; it addresses all that is sacred and all that is tender in my nature; I must be dead to manliness and mercy if I forget it or its import. O Jane! What a thing I am! How have you patience with me! &#x201C;The end of man is an action, not a thought&#x201D;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aristotle, <hi rend="italic">Nicomachean Ethics</hi>, I, iii; X, ix. See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 155.</note> I have told you this a hundred times, and yet how sadly does my own practice contradict it! What have I ever done to merit so much love from you, what shall I ever do to maintain it and repay it! If prayers could make you happy, you were the happiest of mortals: but prayers are not worth an obolus, and these are all that I have ever given you.</p>
<p>Excuse this whining: I ought to be consoling you in your sorrows, not afflicting you by recounting my own. There is no use in the philosophy of comfort; the sole remedy for suffering is diligent action; let us both apply it in our several spheres, and the result will be peaceable <pb id="pg-03-321" n="03:321"/>and blessed. After all, where <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the bugbear? We are alive, and love one another to the end of our existence: a few more sad partings, and we meet, to part no more forever. If we are wise, we shall and must be happy. Courage! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Le bon tem</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">p</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">s viendra</hi></foreign> [The good time will come]; and I prophecy without fear that we shall both deserve it and enjoy it.</p>
<p>Now will you tell me that you are still good to me, and busy and composed in heart, and I will let you go? Say that you have commenced your tasks, and that your headache is away, and I shall think you happy, and depart in peace. Will you write me a letter however short on Sunday? Do, my Dearest, if you please. I know you will, when I say that it will do me good. I will answer it the moment I reach home<supplied>[.]</supplied> Be diligent, and encourage me to be so, and we may set Fortune at defiance. <foreign><hi rend="italic">En &#xE9;t&#xE9; nous nous reverrons</hi></foreign> [In the summer we shall see one another again]! The farewell kiss shall add its tenderness to the kiss of welcome. We shall talk and counsel without let or hindrance; for frank warm kindness will be about us both. Think what is to be done, and when and how; and tell me without reluctance or reserve. Am I not yours entirely and forever, to dispose of as you please?</p>
<p>But this is &#x201C;thought not action&#x201D; again: I must leave you and conclude my business, at least commence it, and fly from the pestilence of smoky stony Athens. As yet I have spoken to no one, but three words to the landlady of these apartments. No word from Crabbe:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Crabb Robinson&#x2019;s long letter in reply to Carlyle&#x2019;s is dated <date when="1825-05-08">8 May</date>. It comments on all the German authors mentioned in Carlyle&#x2019;s letter and on several others. Robinson apologizes for his delay in writing and explains that he has been out of the city visiting an invalid.</note> to-day I must see Brewster and Sir W. Hamilton. On Monday morning I shall have your letter? Do, Jane: it will give solace to yourself as well as me; there is ease in free speech, I am already better since I began to tell you that I was sad. Have you begun your writing? Do begin it forthwith; and think that <supplied>[it]</supplied> is for me you write. Is you<supplied>[r]</supplied> head recovered? For the love you bear me, my own Jane, be careful, be solicitous about your health! Sickness is our only foe: O let us not so fearfully extend its empire! Were <hi rend="italic">you</hi> sick, what would become of us?</p>
<p><closer><salute>And now my Darling, I must take my leave. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my Dearest, <foreign><hi rend="italic">mein ewig liebstes Weib</hi></foreign> [my dearest woman always]! Write on Sunday or sooner if you can.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>I am ever ever, / Your Brother and Friend, /</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle</name>
<ps><p><pb id="pg-03-322" n="03:322"/>Make my kind compliments to your Mother; and try to persuade her that if I were less sick, I should be less disagreeable. I admire her patience with me: by and by I hope it will be less needful.</p>
<p>The address here is Mrs M&#x2019;Leod&#x2019;s, 24. Salisbury-street. Do, be sure to write</p></ps>

<salute>Best and Dearest</salute>
<p>I believe I am going to lose the faculty of writing, as I have already lost the faculty of speech. For this half hour and more, I have been trying to express to you some of the hundred things that are in my heart; and I can find <hi rend="italic">no words</hi>&#x2014;at least none but such as seem cold and inadequate to what I feel. Well! no matter! You know, already, that I love you with all my soul; that I am sad&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">very</hi> sad at parting with you, and shall not be otherwise than sad till we meet again; and, knowing <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, you may easily imagine all that I would and <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> say.</p>
<p>I have but a sorry account to give of myself, since your departure: my head is still aching very diligently; and none of my tasks are yet commenced. Nevertheless I have been far from idle: I have <hi rend="italic">papered a box</hi> for my Mother; reestablished order and elegance in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sanctum</hi></foreign>;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle says that &#x201C;The Sanctum&#x201D; is probably the little room just behind the dining room in Dr. Welsh&#x2019;s house at Haddington.</note> and put all things in readiness to commence operations on Monday. With the help of some unfinished drawings and other wares, I have made this the prettiest, little room you ever saw: and here I will sit four hours a day at the tasks which you have assigned me; in spite of all fools whatever. No <hi rend="italic">criticisms</hi> shall prevent me from following your counsels and the dictates of my conscience. The miserable Lilliputians! They shall not bind <hi rend="italic">me</hi> with their threads! I am free! Thanks to my love for you which has made me so!</p>
<p>I will walk, too, every day, and do all things that you bade me. Yesterday I was at <hi rend="italic">Paradise</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240623-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1824-06-23">23 June 1824</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Alas! Paradise no more; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ich bin allein</hi></foreign> [I am alone]&#x2014; I sat meditating, in the arbour (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">mind of man</hi>)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle attributes the phrase to Edward Irving.</note> till I nearly fell asleep; and then walked sadly home again resting at all the places where we used to rest. The sun was bright <pb id="pg-03-323" n="03:323"/>and the place looked as lovely as ever; but I no longer wished it <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>&#x2014;oh no! the little Fairy&#x2019;s box were worth twenty such residences!</p>
<p>Indeed I am very sad&#x2014; I say to myself, every minute, &#x201C;I am alone; there are leagues of distance between me and my <hi rend="italic">only</hi> Friend; and who knows that I shall ever see him again?&#x201D; It is very weak to be so dispirited, when every thing promises fair; when our happiness seems to depend almost wholely on ourselves: but I cannot help it&#x2014; Oh for the wings of a dove!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 55:6.</note> that I might fly away to your side, and gather consolation and courage from your lips&#x2014; I would take flight this very instant&#x2014; But alas! I have no wings! no wishing carpet! no fairy box! and to visit you in any ordinary fashion, would, in the present posture of affairs, be illadvised&#x2014; Patience then! It cannot be many weeks before I am in Nithsdale&#x2014;and there, my beloved Brother&#x2014;oh more than Brother! we meet again&#x2014;and you will take me <hi rend="italic">home</hi> with you&#x2014;and we shall be happy&#x2014;happy as the day is long. Shall we not Dear?</p>
<p>In the mean time you will write to me <hi rend="italic">often</hi>, and without constraint. No one <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> (means in the third pe<supplied>[rson]</supplied> to promise or threaten)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Carlyle had evidently been explaining to Miss Welsh the proper use of <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> and <hi rend="italic">will</hi>, and she here repeats part of the rules&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note). Jane put a question mark over <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> here and in line 24 below.</note> see your letters. They are the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> pleasure I have; and I am determined to enjoy it to the full. I kept the last to myself, and purpose to do the same with all future ones. Moreover you will continue to love me very dearly&#x2014;more dearly than you ever loved Margaret Gordon<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200603-TC-EI-01">TC to EI, <date when="1820-06-03">3 June 1820</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;for with all my faults I do deserve it of you&#x2014; Well! I am a great fool, and no fraction of a Philosopher: and you M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Socrates are not overwise. But I expect we shall (in the first person simply futurity) both improve&#x2014;</p>
<p>The letter for you is come this minute. I hope it is from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Strachey&#x2014;will you write to all these people the very first leisure day you have&#x2014; Their affection for you is worth cherishing&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> love them for loving you so well&#x2014; I forgot to give you any message to your Brother tho&#x2019; it was several times in my mind. Pray tell him how much I was gratified by his book and that but for the awkwardness of beginning a correspondence with an almost stranger I would have written to me [him] ere now. By and by we shall be better acquainted I expect&#x2014;and then he shall hear from me as often&#x2014;perhaps oftener than he likes. You must lay the blame of my detestable writing on the new mail-coach regulations&#x2014; My letter I find must be in <supplied>[the]</supplied> Post office by two <pb id="pg-03-324" n="03:324"/>oclock; and as I wish [several words crossed out] is to <hi rend="italic">make a demonstration</hi>in [several words crossed out] <hi rend="italic">than usual</hi>.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I hope Mr Mitchell<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Mitchell.</note> did actually call on you on Thursday, as he had promised to me, and explain the unlucky cause of my absence on the preceding evening. Perhaps this failure on my part may be the means of introducing Mr M. to your custom and acquaintance; an arrangement that will give me much pleasure for the sake of both parties, Mr M. being a person of great worth as well as classical learning, and likely from his merits in the New Academy to become a rising man among you.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to the new Edinburgh Academy, started in <date when="1824-10">Oct. 1824</date>, at which Mitchell was a master who became highly respected and who earned the praise of the directors. The Academy was an important institution in the history of Scottish education, offering a middle-class, English-system-oriented education (Greek, mathematics) instead of Latin only as a preparation for the Scottish universities. The rector, Rev. John Williams (later TC&#x2019;s personal friend), was <sic>an Englishman</sic><corr>a Welshman</corr> and Oxonian (see Lockhart&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Scott, passim</hi>).</note></p>
<p>The best apology which I can make for my quick retreat is to send you my plan of our advertisement, the only piece of business that had any right to delay me. I am still of opinion that your Brother and you will be able to concoct some thing far more fitted for the eye of the market than any thing you can expect from me: mean while here is what I have devised, and what may do in fault of better:</p>
<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">German Novellists</hi> [underscored twice]; a series of Tales, Romances and Novels, selected from the works of Goethe, Schiller, Wieland, Tieck<supplied>[,]</supplied> Paul Richer, Lafontaine, Mus&#xE4;us, Hoffman<supplied>[,]</supplied> La Motte Fouqu&#xE9; and others; with introductory essays, critical &#x26; biographical; the whole intended to convey within a moderate compass some accurate impression of the chief Writers in that department of German Literature.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Three volumes will be ready in November.&#x201D;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-325" n="03:325"/>This of course you can alter according to your own good pleasure: I shall be anxious for a sight of it so soon as you have opportunity.</p>
<p>I have said &#x201C;November,&#x201D; tho&#x2019; I can scarce promise positively. However I should <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to go to press some time about September; and if my health will allow me, as there is considerable probability, I hope so to manage. I have to thank you for Tieck&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Phantasus</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ludwig Tieck (<date when="1773">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853">1853</date>), <hi rend="italic">Phantasus.

(Berlin, <date when="1812">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1816">16</date>).</note> a work I wanted tho&#x2019; I called it by another name: had I Lafontaine and Hoffman, I should now be pretty well supplied. If Mr Buchanan, or any of your other friends, can furnish these or any books which you might reckon useful, I make no doubt you will send them without delay. My present stock will reach me to-morrow; and I calculate on beginning <hi rend="italic">Werter</hi> next week.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>, in four volumes, was to be published in <date when="1827">1827</date> by William Tait, Prince&#x2019;s Street, Edinburgh, and Charles Tait, Fleet Street, London.

<salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
<p>I were inexcusable had this long silence been wilful: the kind and delightful letter which you sent me merited at least a prompt and thankful answer, your generous anxieties for my welfare<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu had warned Carlyle in her letter of <date when="1825-04-09">9 April</date> that even though he might enjoy &#x201C;reposing in the Elysian fields of Ecclefechan,&#x201D; he would at the same time cut himself off from &#x201C;intellectual society &#x2026; as necessary to you as the very air you breathe.&#x201D;</note> should not have been met by months of total silence. My apology is a trite but yet a faithful one. Your letter reached me after various retardations, in a scene of petty business and petty engagement, and I had no choice but either to write inanities in reply to elegant and friendly sense or to wait with patience for a calmer day.</p>
<p>That calmer day has not yet come: ever since I left you I have <pb id="pg-03-326" n="03:326"/>been so shifted and shovelled to and fro among men and things of the most discordant character, that my thoughts have altogether lost their regular arrangement, the small citadel of my intellectual identity has almost yielded to so many inroads, at least the garrison, weary of never-ending battle and imperfect conquest, have now locked the gates, and scarcely ever sally out at all. I live without thinking or theorizing, as the passing hour directs, and any true expression of <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> in writing or even speech is a problem of unusual difficulty. You see my situation: I have been disturbed and dissipated till I have become exhausted and stupid. Yesterday I was buying chairs and curtains and even crockery, and there is still no rest till three weeks after Whitsunday! Add to all this, that three days ago, in cutting sticks for certain rows of peas, which I am cultivating here, I tore my thumb&#x2014;so that it winces every line I write! But can the Ethiopian change his skin,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jer. 13:23.</note> or the dolt his dulness, by confession and complaint? I had much rather you should think me stupid than ungrateful, so I write <hi rend="italic">to-day</hi> without farther explanation or apology, which would but aggravate the evil either way. When I think of all your conduct towards me, I confess I am forced to pronounce it <hi rend="italic">magnanimous</hi>. From the first, you had faith enough in human nature to believe that under the vinegar surface of an atrabiliar character, there might lurk some touch of principle and affection,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu had written: &#x201C;Let me hear that you are drawing near to some kind heart that will make life dearer to you, I have never yet been mistaken, and I feel that there are depths of kindness in your nature that will prove a wellspring of living water, pure and ever-flowing, to reward the patient trust of those who will search beneath the dry and arid soil which is parched only because the Simoom of the Desart has passed over it.&#x2014; May all good attend you&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> notwithstanding my repulsive aspect you followed me with unwearied kindness, while near you, and now that I am far off, and you suspect me of stealing from you the spirit of your most valued friend,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving.</note> you still think tenderly of me, you send me cheering words into my solitude, amid these rude moors a little dove-like messenger arrives to tell me that I am not forgotten, that I still live in the memories and wishes of some noble souls. Believe me, I am not unthankful for this, I am poor in heart, but not entirely a bankrupt. There are moments when the thought of these things makes me ten years younger, when I feel with what fervid gratitude I should have welcomed sympathy, or the very show of sympathy, from such a quarter, had it then been offered me; and vow that <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> changed as matters are you shall not escape me, that I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> yet understand you and love <pb id="pg-03-327" n="03:327"/>you, and be understood and loved by you. I did you injustice, I never <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> you till about to lose you. Base Judean<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, V, ii: &#x201C;One whose hand / (Like the base Judean) threw a Pearle away / Richer than all his Tribe.&#x201D; See also <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241028-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1824-10-28">28 Oct. 1824</date></ref>. Oddly enough, Carlyle later became confused about this quotation, after the reading &#x201C;base Indian&#x201D; had come to be preferred; and a note in his hand, in the Frederick W. Hilles Collection, reads: &#x201C;There is one other scandalous error <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Indian&#x2019;</hi> for &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Judean</hi>&#x2019; somewhere, once; but I think you have no chance to come upon that at present.&#x201D; This seems to relate to a published work and to be addressed to his printer or publisher.</note> that I was! Can you forgive without forgetting me? I hope yet to be near you long and often, and to taste in your society the purest pleasure, that of fellow-feeling with a generous and cultivated mind. How rare it is in life, and what were life without it! Forgive me if you can. If my affection and gratitude have any value in your eyes, you are like to be no loser by my error. I felt it before I left you, I feel it still more deeply now.</p>
<p>I must also entreat you to free me from the charge of alienating Mr. Irving from the friend whom he should value most. I have no such influence as you ascribe to me, and if I had I hope I should be sorry so to use it. Edward Irving must be blind indeed if he does not see that you love him with the affection of a mother; and he were no longer <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Edward if this itself did not bind him to you. Depend on it, my dear Madam, for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> time you are wrong. Our friend does not love you or esteem you less: it is only his multifarious purposes and ever-shifting avocations that change the outward aspect of his conduct. He was my earliest, almost my only friend, and yet for two years after he began to reign among you, I could not wring a single letter from him! You must tolerate such things in him, and still be kind to him, and not forsake him, in his present circumstances, however it may fare with him, your counsel might be doubly precious. For Mrs. [Strachey] also I must say a friendly word. She does not hate you, she respects you and desires your friendship. Will you believe that I had actually engaged to be her mediator with you, and to bring about an intimacy which I saw might be so profitable to her! On a narrower inspection I renounced the project in despair; yet I feel convinced you would like her were she fully known to you. That you disagreed at first cannot be strange to me; her primary impression of you was in some degree like my own, and you had not the toleration for her inexperience which you had for mine. I confess I have still some hope from the flight of years; where one sees a want and the means of supplying it, one would gladly bring about a combination. Had you been Mrs. <pb id="pg-03-328" n="03:328"/><supplied>[Strachey]</supplied>&#x2019;s sister, she had never been a mystic devotee, and never trod the thorny paths thro&#x2019; which her vehement, sincere and misdirected spirit is struggling after what in all its forms is the highest aim of mortals&#x2014;Moral Truth. But the [letter torn] judgment of character must be fallible in your eyes [torn] will go for nothing.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu&#x2019;s letter had said: &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving is unwell&#x2014;he has an affection of the Chest which he has often before complained of&#x2014;he looks thin, and has for the last week kept the house.&#x2014; I do not see much of him&#x2014; You shook his affection for me without intending it: he is not conscious of this, <hi rend="italic">but I am&#x2014; You</hi>, who are the antipodes of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Strachey, agreed with her on this point, agreeing in nothing else&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving feels more than he reasons, and the moment a sentiment is made uneasy to him he makes haste to get rid of it altogether.&#x2014; Of the Lady&#x2019;s motive I cannot doubt, it was pure hatred of me, of your motive I do not doubt either, it was a pure love of truth.&#x2014; I grieve for the result, for his sake, more than for my own. I spoke the truth to him when a fear of being less popular kept every body silent, and stept boldly between him and those who meant only to disgrace him&#x2014;&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>But ill success in this attempt does not deter me from a new one. You know Miss Welsh of Haddington, if not in name, at least in character and from her friends. I was with her at her mother&#x2019;s when you wrote to me. Jane knew the writer by the portraiture of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> not unfriendly friends, admired and liked the letter, and begged of me to let her keep it.</p>
<p>She had refused an invitation to Pentonville: one of her chief regrets in declining it was the veto put on her commencing an acquaintance with you.</p>
<p>She asked would you not write to <hi rend="italic">her</hi>? I engaged to try, and now will you? Can you?</p>
<p>This young lady is a person you will love and tend as a daughter when you meet; an ardent, generous, gifted being, banished to the pettinesses of a country town; loving, adoring the excellent in all its phases, but without models, advisers or sympathy. Six years ago she lost her father, the only person who had ever understood her; since that hour she has never mentioned his name; she never alludes to him yet, without an agony of tears.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Irving&#x2019;s wish, and mine, and most of all her own, to have you for her friend, that she should live beside you till she understood you, that she might have at least one model to study, one woman with a mind as warm and rich to show her by living example how the most complex destiny might be wisely managed. Separated by space, could you draw near to one another by the imperfect medium of letters? Jane thinks it would abate the &#x201C;awe&#x201D; which she must necessarily feel on first meeting with you personally. She wishes it; I also if <pb id="pg-03-329" n="03:329"/>it were attainable; is it not? I should now depict my doings and my circumstances, my farming and my gardening, literature and dietetics. All this demands another sheet, which I trust you will <hi rend="italic">very</hi> soon afford me opportunity of sending. I am getting healthier and happier, living by the strictest letter of the Badamian Code, and hoping steadfastly to conquer the baleful monster which has crushed me to the dust so long.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu had written about Badams&#x2019; business activities and had also said: &#x201C;Thirty years since I knew a poor dissenting minister Lewis Lloyd, one of the most intelligent and happiest of men. All he had was a salary of fifty pounds a year&#x2014;we were a party of six young people and it was not easy to have found six poorer, or six merrier people&#x2014;in process of time Lewis Lloyd left the church and became what he now is, the possessor of millions&#x2014;the richest Banker in London&#x2014; He said a few days since to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Montague <supplied>[&#x2018;]</supplied>I have never had the courage yet to see your Wife&#x2014; I would give all I possess in the world to recall the happy days I spent in her company when a Girl.<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>&#x201D;</note> Do write as soon as possible and do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> pay the postage.</p>
<p><closer><salute>I am unjust to you no more, but ever most sincerely yours,</salute></closer></p>
<name>Thomas Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>You will make my best respects to Mr. Montagu, and to Mrs. and Mr. Procter, the latter I hope will by and by bethink him of his promise, and let me have a sheet of literary news.</p>
<p>Is my dear Badams with you? Did you get the book I sent for him? Excuse this miserable letter. I am sick and in confusion. Next time I will do better.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I write to you today, lest you should get uneasy about me or discontented with me; not because I have the slightest particle of tidings that can interest you to communicate, or the slightest particle of speculation that can profit you. When I have said that I am well and good to you as ever, and busied solely with the most prosaic occupations, little more remains for me to tell you.</p>
<p>I am living here in the middle of confusion worse confounded: the cares that occupy me are not those of the philosopher on paper, but of the philosopher <foreign><hi rend="italic">in foro</hi></foreign> [in the forum]; it is not the talents of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">bel &#xE9;sprit</hi></foreign> [noble spirit] but those of the upholsterer that will stead me. There is no syllable of translation, far less of composition (save of <pb id="pg-03-330" n="03:330"/>bed-hangings, and green or yellow washes), nor will there be for two good weeks at least; nothing but cheapening and computation, and fighting with the pitiful details of Whitsunday<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scottish term-day for removals, then <date when="1825-05-26">26 May</date>.</note> and future housekeeping. I have read nothing, but half of one German novel, last sunday! Not long ago, all this would have made me miserable; but at present I submit to it with equanimity, and even find enjoyment in the thought that in this humblest of the spheres of existence I am <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> all I can to save my spirit and my fortunes from the shipwreck which threatened them, and to fit me for discharging to myself and others whatever duties my natural or accidental capabilities, slender but actually existing as they are, point out and impose upon me. Alas, Jane! there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> Bird of Paradise; nothing that can live upon the odour of flowers, and hover among pure ether, without ever lighting on the clay of Earth! The eagle itself must gather sticks to build its nest, and in its highest soarings keep an eye upon its creeping prey.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A vivid and clear-cut anticipation of Carlyle&#x2019;s complementary descendentalism and transcendentalism and the ambivalence of his philosophy expressed in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> and elsewhere.</note> Once I thought this a sad arrangement; now I do not think so. &#x201C;The mind of man&#x201D; is a machine considerably more complex than a pepper or even coffee mill; there is a strength and beauty where at first there seemed only weakness and deformity; our highest happiness is connected with our meanest wants. I begin to approve of this: At any rate <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wir sind nun einmal so gemacht</hi></foreign> [We are in simple truth made so], and there is an end of it.</p>
<p>One thing that pleases and consoles me at present is my increased and increasing faith in the return of health, the goal of all these efforts. I am already <hi rend="italic">wonderfully</hi> better than when you saw me: I am a driveller if in spite of all impediments from others and myself, I do not grow completely well. The thought of this is like a second boyhood to me: glimpses of old purposes and feelings dawn on my horizon with an aspect more earnest but not less lovely; I swear that I will be a <hi rend="italic">wise man</hi>, that thou my darling wilt be good and wise also; and if so, what can hinder us from being happy and active, what more have we to wish for?</p>
<p>I more and more applaud myself for having fled from towns, and chosen this simple scene for the commencement of my operations. Heaven pity those that are sweltering today along the fiery pavements of London, begirt with smoke and putrefaction and the boundless tumults and distractions of that huge treadmill! Here I can see from <pb id="pg-03-331" n="03:331"/>Hartfell to Helvellyn, from Criffel to the crags of Christenberry; a green unmanufactured carpet covers all the circle of my vision, fleecy clouds and the azure vault are above me, and the pure breath of my native Solway blows wooingly thro&#x2019; all my haunts. Internally and morally, the difference is not less important in my favour. Stupidity and selfishness make up the general character of men in the country as they do in towns; but here one has the privilege of freedom from the sight of it; all dunces and Turks in grain, one transacts his painful hour of business with, and packs away, with an implied injunction, peremptory tho&#x2019; unpronounced, not again to trouble one till another hour of business shall arrive.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Although Carlyle scoffed at &#x201C;view-hunting&#x201D; in the manner of Wordsworth and Byron, he was actually very susceptible to his environment, whether in the city or country, and a master in describing it.</note> &#x201C;But then society?&#x201D;&#x2014; There is little of it on Earth, very little: and unhappy is the man whose own door does not inclose what is worth all the rest of it ten times told. My own Jane! you cannot think how I rejoice that your tastes in this point correspond so completely with my own. O if I had thee, in peace and happiness, within my parlour, tho&#x2019; all the Reviewers and scribent hacks and blues and &#x201C;literary characters&#x201D; in nature should forget that I existed! <hi rend="italic">Will</hi> the time come, think you? Yes, it must and shall, and then&#x2014;!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But alas for poor &#x201C;divine philosophy&#x201D;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Comus</hi>, l. 476.</note> If I think of this I shall soon lose sight of her, and instead of becoming a wise man become a foolish boy. Let us leave it then. I should have told you in plain prose in an earlier portion of my sheet that I arrived here ten days ago, having hastily collected some forty tomes of German fiction, and fled from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> as from a pest house, where day after day my state was growing more intolerable. Thanks for your dear letter: I know you are a good creature, and <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> hate me, if you would. I was in such a haste that I forgot a number of things, among others (<foreign><hi rend="italic">proh pudor</hi></foreign>! [oh, for shame!]) the good Sherriff&#x2019;s message to Bengo the Engraver!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mr. Sherriff was a Haddington neighbor. John Bengo, and Edinburgh engraver and copperplate printer, was established at 54 South Bridge.</note> You must make my peace with the worthy Sherriff: I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> heartily sorry for my gross omission; but I was sick almost to distraction while in Edinburgh, and I found his letter for the first time in my pocket at Mai<supplied>[n]</supplied>hill. Your gloves also (poor little gloves!) I found there: I have laid the<supplied>[m]</supplied> by safely; you shall never get them, till <hi rend="italic">you come and seek them</hi>&#x2014;if then. Such is the fate of simple maid!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-332" n="03:332"/>On Thursday we split up our establishment here, and one division of us files away to Hoddam Hill. What a hurly-burly, what an anarchy and chaos! In less than forty days, the deluge will abate, however; and the first olive branch (of peace and health) will shew itself above the mud. My literary projects are till then stationary, but not unfit for moving in a calmer time. Crabbe Robinson<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His letter of <date when="1825-05-08">8 May</date>.</note> has written to me; I saw Sir W. Hamilton<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200603-TC-JOFE-01">TC to <sic>JF</sic><corr>JOFE</corr>, <date when="1820-06-03">3 June 1820</date></ref>.</note> (apparently among the best men I have ever met in Edinburgh), and Dr Irving introduced me to Dr Julius<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Nicholas Heinrich Julius (<date when="1783">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862">1862</date>) was a widely traveled scholar and philanthropist. He was in the United States in <date when="1834">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835">35</date> studying systems of prison discipline to report on them to his government. His name occurs in George S. Hillard&#x2019;s biography of Ticknor, whose <hi rend="italic">History of Spanish Literature</hi> he translated into German.</note> (Yooliooss) of Hamburg, who almost embraced me as a father, because I had written a Life of Schiller and translated a novel of Goethe&#x2019;s. Julius is a man of letters; as well as a Doctor, and a person of official dignity, being sent by his government to investigate the laws of quarantine, which our parliament now meditates altering. I regretted that my previous arrangements hindered me from seeing him above an hour; but I liked him much, and he promised to write me his advice regarding these German books some time in summer. So far all is well.</p>
<p>I had left my trunks at Moffat, and they did not come till two days after my arrival. Your little box I opened in the presence of many eager faces; your gifts were snatched with <foreign><hi rend="italic">lauter Jubelgeschrey</hi></foreign> [shouts of pure jubilation]; I question if ever gifts were welcomed with truer thanks or gave more happiness to the receivers. All stood amazed at the elegance of their &#x201C;very grand&#x201D; acquisitions, some praised in words the generous young <hi rend="italic">Leddy</hi> who had sent them, little Jenny flourished her green bag &#x201C;like an antique Maenad,&#x201D; and for the whole evening was observed to be <hi rend="italic">a wee carried</hi> [elated], even when the first blush of the business was over. My Mother was as proud (<hi rend="italic">purse</hi>-proud) as any. She knows that you are coming, but she will tell no man of it, so you need not fear. Her warmest welcome as that of all and sundry waits you; this in your eyes will make amends for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> deficiencies. On the whole I think we shall be happy, and you must not <hi rend="italic">rue</hi>. Have you told your Mother? she surely will not put a veto on so fine and innocent a scheme.&#x2014; Now judge if I have room to ask you all the questions you must answer, asked or not! My letter is a perfect <hi rend="italic">burble</hi> but if I cannot talk <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; tort et &#xE0; travers</hi></foreign> [at random] to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, to whom can I? Is your <pb id="pg-03-333" n="03:333"/>headache gone? For Heaven&#x2019;s sake tell me that it is. Are you writing&#x2014;writing for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>? Do you still love me? I have ceased to love you some time ago.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your Evil Genius,</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>[In margins:] I wrote to Mrs Montague the other day, and advised her to write to you, as to a young person of etherial temper, for whom the Fates condemned me to entertain some foolish fondness.

<p>Can you execute a commission for me, and will you? James Johnston the meek pedagogue, of whom you have heard me speak, is returned from France, and wishes to exchange his present place of Tutor in a family at Broughty-ferry, for some permanent appointment in a school.

<p>You must make my kindest compliments to your mother; she shall not always dislike me. But if possible, let the <hi rend="italic">letters be your own</hi>, as you propose: it is far better: whom have I but thee, whom has thou but me?</p>

<salute>My Dearest</salute>
<p>&#x201C;I write today lest you should get uneasy about me, or discontented with me&#x201D;: &#x2014;taking it for granted that you are neither uneasy nor discontented <pb id="pg-03-334" n="03:334"/>already&#x2014;&#x201C;not because I have the slightest particle of tidings that can interest you to communicate, or the slightest particle of speculation that can profit you&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quoted from Carlyle&#x2019;s letter to her of <date when="1825-05-22">22 May</date>.</note> &#x2014;not that I take any earthly pleasure in writing to you, or feel any anxiety to get your letter in return.</p>
<p>You must be very critical if you are not struck with admiration of this &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">particular</hi>&#x2019; smart exordium&#x2014; To have served you rightly, I should have made you wait for a month to come; but unluckily I have got several things to say which I cannot keep longer to myself. In the first place, then, I am coming to Nithsdale as soon as the currants are ripe, and the jelly made; and thence I am coming to Hoddam hill if you have not <hi rend="italic">rued</hi>. My Mother was in one of her gracious humours the other night, and <hi rend="italic">sounding</hi> me about Dumfries-shire. The moment seemed favourable so I opened my mouth and spake: &#x201C;would there be any impropriety in my going <hi rend="italic">to Annandale</hi> when I am in the neighbourhood&#x201D;&#x2014; The question sounded so abrupt and awkward that I blushed for half an hour after. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">To Annandale</hi><supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> repeated my Mother, and then &#x201C;Oh! impropriety? certainly not: on the contrary I think it would be highly advisable: and if you have any <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> about going by yourself&#x2014;I am quite willing to accompany you.&#x201D; What condescension! I expressed my sense of her obligingness but said I should have much less &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">feeling</hi>&#x2019; alone. This was <hi rend="italic">one</hi> expedient for annihilating the happiness of our project, with the most wonderful rapidity she fell upon another. &#x201C;It will be best for you,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;to go straight to Annandale from here; I will stay a day or two behind you, that we may get to Templand about the same time; and in this way <hi rend="italic">nobody will know of it</hi>.&#x201D; I am surprised she did not propose sending me nail<supplied>[e]</supplied>d up in a box, with &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">glass</hi>&#x2019; written on the top. Such a mysterious arrangement, I told her, was likely to have a very different result. besides I designed to make no secret of the matter, as I did not care how many people <hi rend="italic">knew of it</hi>. At last it was settled that I should go from my Grandmother&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to A. Carlyle, from the home of her paternal grandmother, formerly of Penfillan, now of Albany Place, Dumfries.</note> by the coach to Annan where you might come to fetch me to Repentance. This is the most convenient way; don&#x2019;t you think? tell me when you write. Oh if these tedious currants were only ripe! but they will not be, for two or three weeks yet, and it will be two or three weeks more before I get the length of Annan. The last time, I was at Annan I thought myself the most unfortunate person in it&#x2014;when I am there again I shall be the happiest!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-335" n="03:335"/>I have had a letter from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Some excerpts follow from Mrs. Montagu&#x2019;s letter to Jane Welsh, dated <date when="1825-05-30">30 May</date>: &#x201C;If your servant were at this moment to announce &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Mrs Montagu</hi>&#x2019; we should both feel something of that natural Embarrassment with which stranger meets stranger, tho&#x2019; the conventional forms of good breeding in all cases, and a desire to please in our case, would teach us to hide it, but now, living as I do in your mind&#x2019;s eye and associated with the friends you love best, I approach you without reserve, and I feel that I am kindly welcomed. &#x2026; Am I fanciful in thinking you something like myself? a little too high-set for the persons, whom you are in a provincial town or Village obliged in some sort to associate with, and consequently living in the invisible, rather than the visible world?&#x2014; If so, your notion of character and your expectations of virtue and noble feeling will betray you to much anguish, and continual disappointment. &#x2026; My trust in human nature has scattered thorns in my path, for it had no foundation in truth and every-day experience. &#x2026; I could say much to you of our dear friend Edward Irving whom I love for himself alone, (without any reference to myself) <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, probably than he is loved by any other creature<supplied>[:]</supplied> he is to me nothing, and yet every thing, another soul, another mind; one whose virtues raise me to the highest happiness, whose faults humble me to the dust. &#x2026; His Wife, but for her great piety, must be wretched, for he cannot (with every desire to do so) give her any part of his time except in the hours of refreshment &#x26; sleep&#x2014;and she must live among persons whom you could not endure for a moment&#x2014; As for Thomas Carlyle! but he deserves a whole letter to himself.&#x201D; Mrs. Montagu wrote Carlyle a letter on the same day. In it she says that she found the letter to Jane difficult to write. Jane&#x2019;s letter in reply has not been found.</note> and, (which is still more extraordinary) I have answered it. What on earth did you say, to make her so good to me? She could not have written more frankly and affectionately if I had been her own child. I have never met with any thing like this from Woman before&#x2014; I purpose loving M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu all my life; if I find her always the same as she has introduced herself to me. She <hi rend="italic">is &#x2018;noble&#x2019;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">very</hi> clever. With what inimitable grace she manages every thing! After speaking of Edward Irving she says: &#x201C;as for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">he</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu did not underscore <hi rend="italic">he</hi>.</note> deserves a sheet to himself, and I have got to the end of my paper.&#x201D; Could she have ple<supplied>[ased]</supplied> me better, tho&#x2019; she had extolled you thro&#x2019; a whole quire? I hope you will not be jealous if I fall rather extravagantly in love with her?</p>

My <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> is drawing to a close: there are already from forty to fifty pages of it&#x2014;quite enough truly on so worthless a subject&#x2014; If it were not that my <hi rend="italic">honour</hi> is concerned in this task, I should [<hi rend="italic">would</hi> written above]<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She is still pondering Carlyle&#x2019;s lesson on the distinction between <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> and <hi rend="italic">will</hi>.</note> throw <pb id="pg-03-336" n="03:336"/>it aside not out of laziness, but despair at my own stupidity. I have less difficulty indeed in writing <hi rend="italic">for you</hi>, than <hi rend="italic">for the public</hi> [underscored twice].

However there is no use in vexing myself about the matter. As Nature has made a sheep of me, and not an eagle, I cannot with all the straining in the world raise myself off the ground.

<salute>My Dear Johnstone,</salute>
<p>I have just received a letter from Haddington; of which the following is an extract:</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have inquired about the Parish School: there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to be one; but not for a twelvemonth; the house taken for the purpose will not be ready till then. If your friend is not settled by that time, and the situation to his mind, I think there is little doubt of his getting it: for Gilbert Burns, who has most to say in the business, has promised me to support any person recommended by you. But I question if your friend would like the situation. He would only have twenty pounds of salary. To be sure there will be a tolerable house, a good garden, and the profits of his teaching besides: but still it will be no object to any one who is already well employed. Gilbert wishes a schoolmaster who will not only teach the children to read but to <hi rend="italic">understand</hi>; and who will also give them ideas about religion. He bids me tell you this.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Such is the intelligence I have got. On the whole, I think it promising; at least worth farther consideration, and inquiry. The easiest and shortest mode of getting light thrown upon it would perhaps be a journey to Haddington, and a personal investigation of the place and its capabilities. If you think so, let me know, and I will furnish you with credentials to Gilbert Burns, and insure you of a friendly reception, and a candid explanation of all you want to know. Gilbert is a person you will like and be liked by; an honest Scottish yeoman, of the true school; religious, intelligent, affectionate, unpretending. His character and his <hi rend="italic">name</hi> are almost of themselves worth such a journey. He will talk to you of farming, of practical morality, of Scotland, of his brother. Tell me when you have decided, and I undertake to lose no time. It is better that the thing be settled soon; for in that case, either you have a fixed hope before you, or your hands are free to seek one. I have considerable expectations that the place may answer you; that it may prove a resting-place to the sole of your foot, and a home where you may close, or at least rest from, your perplexed wanderings, and be a &#x201C;man among your fellow-men.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Since you left us there has nothing in the slightest degree remarkable occurred among us. The out-of-doors people are busy with their <pb id="pg-03-338" n="03:338"/>turnips, or bullying with the knave Blackadder<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sandy Blackadder. See James Carlyle to Matthew Sharpe, <date when="1825-11-07">7 Nov.</date></note> about his frantic demands which they have told him they do not give a rush for: the indoor community are churning butter, or reading books and &#x201C;sporting on paper&#x201D; as of old. I am growing better weekly; the cabbages are swelling &#x201C;like broth-pots,&#x201D; the beans and peas have an odour far beyond that of <foreign><hi rend="italic">mille fleurs</hi></foreign> [perfume: a thousand flowers], and upwards of two hundred roses promise to greet me in a fortnight. What more could I desire?</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood scarcely any news. <hi rend="italic">Gove Pool</hi> was here today, and told us that poor <hi rend="italic">Peg Duke</hi> died yesterday, bitterly accusing Parliament<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Parliament Geordie&#x201D; (Dr. George Little). The setting of the tragic story seems to be Annandale.</note> in her last hours for the ruin of her soul and body! There is a coarse horror in this affair, a vulgar tragic that I cannot get rid of; it has clung to my thoughts ever since I heard it.</p>
<p>Jack and I are on the wing for Annan; he stamping to and fro, <hi rend="italic">encouraging</hi> me to be done. I must conclude abruptly. Write whenever you have made up your mind. Jack&#x2019;s best compliments. <closer><salute>Believe me ever,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>After two weeks of patient and two of impatient waiting, your letter at last arrived. It seems I ought to thank Providence rather than you for the favour; and indeed to me it makes little difference which. So long as Providence shall please to give you &#x201C;several things which you cannot do without telling me,&#x201D; I am perfectly content. For the rest, what use is there in telling you that I long for an answer? Do I tell my Mother that, generally speaking, in the forenoon of every lawful and unlawful day, I desire to have some morsel of breakfast? She makes it for me, and there is an end.</p>
<p>I rejoice to hear that you are busy, and constant in your business. The <hi rend="italic">theory</hi> of happy living grows plainer to me every day: Let thought be turned to action, or dismissed entirely; there lies the whole secret: <pb id="pg-03-339" n="03:339"/>it is pity only that the <hi rend="italic">practice</hi> should be so much harder than the demonstration! I can give myself and you the sagest rules of conduct: but for the fulfilment of them&#x2014;alas! alas!&#x2014; I expect that <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of yours will do us both good: the advanced stage of its progress already rebukes me for my own inaction; and <hi rend="italic">when you arrive</hi>, what a choice text will it be for long volumes of philosophy! What a sweet termination too! &#x201C;On the&#x2014;&#x2014;day of July, my beloved Mr <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sansterre</hi></foreign> [Landless] was waiting for me in the lower district of Annandale; he had the audacity to clasp me in his arms, and kiss me, and here my <hi rend="italic">Life came to a close</hi>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Your arrival in these parts promises to form a sort of epoch in our domestic history. All hands are waiting for you with a sentiment compounded of terror and delight. My Mother sends her kindest compliments, and says in various phraseology that so long as you can tolerate her rude irregular <foreign><hi rend="italic">m&#xE9;nage</hi></foreign>, she will be proud to have your company. My Father too expects you, I believe, with considerable impatience, and without any of the fear that overhangs the hearts of others. For him, he could open the wattled door of his wigwam, if he dwell in one, and welcome with a serene spirit the monarch of Europe; or dismiss him as serenely if he thought that better. On the whole, however, this <hi rend="italic">royal visit</hi> is anticipated as a great affair. I expect for my share, that notwithstanding all your practical philosophy, you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be considerably astonished at the Hibernian aspect of things here; but as Laertes says, <hi rend="italic">was thuts</hi>?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Translated by Carlyle as &#x201C;What does it signify?&#x201D; Cf. <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre, Works</hi>, XXIII, 272.</note> You wish to see <hi rend="italic">Man as he is</hi>, I wish it also; so come and make the trial. If you can live contentedly on the resources of Repentance Hill, with no society but that of honest-hearted toilsome people, to whom rest is the highest recreation, you are far advanced in your domestic culture; you might live even at Craigenputtock for <hi rend="italic">two</hi> months with an angel. If not, I will persuade you to stay till you have seen and understood; and then to think, with how very little means the human spirit may be kept in happiness and raised to its full moral stature.</p>
<p>When are those currants to be ready? I wish the Sun would shine, and your Aunt bestir herself, and get them fairly <hi rend="italic">preserved</hi>, and let you go. Your Mother was particularly kind to give her <hi rend="italic">permit</hi> so readily; I think the arrangement of your journey is now much better than it was; nothing is wanted but the <hi rend="italic">execution</hi>. You need not go so far as Annan; three coaches pass every evening within two miles of us: direct <pb id="pg-03-340" n="03:340"/>the guard to stop with you at Kelhead (three miles from Annan); Jack and I will be there with a pony saddled and bridled, and tea will be waiting for you here. I will shew you Kirkconnel churchyard, and Fair Helen&#x2019;s grave<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. M. Sloan in <hi rend="italic">The Carlyle Country</hi> (<date when="1904">1904</date>), pp. 11&#x2013;12, gives the traditional story, which dates from the seventeenth century. He takes it from Sir Walter Scott, <hi rend="italic">The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</hi> (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803">3</date>), who gives his own version of the old song or ballad. Various other poets have versified the same tale, among them Wordsworth, who called his poem &#x201C;Ellen Irwin.&#x201D;</note> if I can find it; I will take you to the top of Burnswark, and wander with you up and down these woods and lanes and moors, and talk of all things new and old. Earth sea and air are open to us here as well as anywhere; the water of Milk<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A river in Annandale.</note> was flowing through its simple valley as early as the brook Siloa, and poor Repentance Hill is as old as Caucasus itself. There is a majesty and mystery in Nature, take her as you will; the essence of all poetry comes breathing to a mind that feels, from every province of her empire. Is she not immoveable, eternal, and immense, in Annandale as she is in Chamouni? The chambers of the East are opened in every land, and the Sun comes forth to sow the Earth with orient pearl; Night, the ancient Mother, follows him with her diadem of stars; and Arcturus and Orion call <hi rend="italic">me</hi> into the infinitudes of space as they called the Druid Priest or the Shepherd of Chaldea. Bright creatures! How they gleam like spirits, through the shadows of innumerable ages, from their thrones in the boundless depths of heaven!</p>
<lg><l>&#x201C;Who ever gazed upon them shining,</l>
<l>And turned to Earth without repining,</l>
<l>And did not wish for wings to fly away</l>
<l>To mix with their ethereal ray?&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quoted loosely from Byron&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Siege of Corinth,&#x201D; ll. 248&#x2013;51.</note></l></lg>
<p>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> have, twenty times; tho&#x2019; now and then also I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi>. Would <hi rend="italic">you</hi> go with me? Come, and let us consult. In plain prose, we shall have peace and quietness here, and if our minds can amuse <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi>, well and good; if they cannot, they may even go unamused.</p>
<p>I must not terminate this valuable sheet (excuse the beautiful stamped border, for <supplied>[in truth]</supplied> I had no other) without sending you a paragraph about myself, and my specific <supplied>[occu]</supplied>pations. Happily, the whole may be summed up in little compass. F<supplied>[or my]</supplied>self, I am gradually and steadily gathering health; and for my occupations, they am<supplied>[ount]</supplied> to <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>. It is many a weary year since I have been so idle or so happy. I have not done two sheets of Werter yet; I read Richter <pb id="pg-03-341" n="03:341"/>and Jacobi, I ride, and hoe cabbages, and like Basil Montague, am &#x201C;a lover of all quiet things.&#x201D; Sometimes something in the shape of conscience says to me: &#x201C;You will please to observe, Mr Tummas, that time is flying fast away, and you are very poor and ignorant and unknown, and verging towards nine and twenty. What is to become of you in the long run, Mr Thummas? Are you not partly of opinion that you are&#x2014;an ass? The world is running past you, you are out of the battle altogether, my pretty Sir; no promotion, knowledge, money, glory&#x201D;&#x2014; To which I usually answer: &#x201C;And what the d&#x2014;&#x2014; is the matter? What have knowledge, money, glory done for me hitherto? Could they quench the burning of my soul, or get me one hour of deep rest? Time, you say, is flying: to how many mortals have you seen this same Time yield any portion of contentment and dignity? how much has it yielded me? Let it fly, twice as fast if it like!&#x201D;&#x2014; On the whole, however, I hope this humour will not be my final one. It is rather a sort of <hi rend="italic">holy truce</hi>, a <foreign><hi rend="italic">pax Dei</hi></foreign> which exhausted Nature has conquered for herself from all the fiends that assaulted and beset her; as her strength returns, the battle will again commence. Yet, never, I trust, with such fateful eagerness as of old! I see the arena of Life lying round me, desolate and quiet as the ashes of Mount Aetna; flowers and verdure will again spring over its surface, but I know that <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> is still beneath it, and that it or I have no foundation or endurance. O human life! O soul of man!&#x2014; But my paper is concluded.</p>
<p>I am glad that you have answered Mrs Montague, and liked her. She labours under some delusion, I believe, about your secret history, but she has skill to manage any thing. I have had a letter from her, full of eloquence, in which she tells me that &#x201C;your heart is in England your heart is not here.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns&#x2019;s &#x201C;My Heart&#x2019;s in the Highlands,&#x201D; partly his, partly an old song.</note> This is the &#x201C;romance of real life.&#x201D; She lays down in distinct and minute language the duties that <hi rend="italic">my</hi> most enviable wife will have to engage with; that also is romance; but you shall see it when you come. On the whole, she <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a noble woman, after making all allowances. In the midst of all that rhetoric, there is sincerity and goodness and highmindedness enough to furnish fifty ordinary women. I must write to her again.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu wrote in her letter to Carlyle of <date when="1825-05-30">30 May</date>: &#x201C;In writing to Miss Welsh, I have had a task of considerable difficulty&#x2014; &#x2018;Her heart is in England, her heart is not there&#x2019;&#x2014;and I feared to be the means of stirring an old flame the embers of which are still glowing on both sides&#x2014; I am at once a link between persons seperated by duty, rather than inclination, and there is a third party still more difficult to deal with, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Irving herself.&#x2014; If Miss Welsh were to pass one week with me, she might be satisfied that to be M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irvings wife, would (to a spirit of her tone), be entire and unmixed misery<supplied>[&#x2014;]</supplied> they are not the least fitted to each other,&#x2014;but it would not be easy to impress this upon a mind full of an image moulded by its own fancy; our friend stoops now and then to look at the world thro&#x2019; the little glasses of the raree-show and pigmy&#x2019;s seem giants, but he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> raise himself to his own natural dimensions and see things as they are, and he is not unconscious that this &#x2018;Master-spirit&#x2019; would not have proved as safe for him or as guidable, as that which is content to be moved at his bidding&#x2014;&#x201D; She also gives news about Badams: &#x201C;Badams is well&#x2014;he has brought the men who tried to cheat him in his mining speculation to open shame&#x2014; they are at his mercy&#x2014;and he is like a Royal Lion quite grand and still, with the crouching reptiles under his paw&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> Mrs Strachey is in my debt. <pb id="pg-03-342" n="03:342"/>To Edward Irving, I have not written a syllable!

<salute><hi rend="italic">My adorable</hi> Mr Thomas</salute>
<p>I will <foreign><hi rend="italic">schreiben</hi></foreign> [write] instantly since you are wearying; tho I doubt if you will thank me for it, as I am in the dullest of all possible moods.</p>
<p>While you have been arguing the goodfornothingness of knowledge, money, glory&#x2014;and love too no doubt&#x2014;a danger has passed over your unconscious head, which might well have given a more somber hue to your speculations&#x2014;nothing less than the cutting short of both my lives at once&#x2014; I can hardly say what has ailed me; but for these <pb id="pg-03-343" n="03:343"/>last three weeks I have been in the most uncomfortable plight. I gave over sleeping and then gave over eating, while my head ached in an unmerciful manner day and night. All this with the help of drugs and hot-baths made me so very weak that I could not walk twenty yards. Be <hi rend="italic">comforted</hi>&#x2014;however: for I am fast recovering and expect to set out for Dumfries-shire in about a fortnight&#x2014; Then!&#x2014; My heart beats faster than usual when I think of walking into the midst of your family. But I <hi rend="italic">will</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The lesson in <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> and <hi rend="italic">will</hi> again.</note> come, if I am alive. I think I should be quite well if I was beside you again. Surely the Fates are against <hi rend="italic">my</hi> purposes! Let me be ever so studiously disposed I get nothing accomplished. Will it be always thus? If I though so I would say my prayers and hang myself without more ado&#x2014; But when we get this delightful house in the country and &#x201C;all things to fit around us like the wheels in an eight day clock&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Carlyle&#x2019;s letter to her of <date when="1824-08-12">12 Aug. 1824</date>.</note> I flatter myself that I shall have no more headach<supplied>[e]</supplied>s, no more vexatious interruptions; that I shall have health and quietness to study all things under the sun, and to imitate Theresa<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>. The source of the quotation which follows is unknown.</note> &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">in her imitable points</hi>&#x201D; besides. In the meantime, Dearest, will you please to recollect, that two hundred a year is not to be gained by hoeing cabbages; that it would scarce be advisable to set up housekeeping on less; and that I am heartily sick of my existence in this miserable Haddington. What a cold Lover you are who need to be reminded of this! and what must I be that I <hi rend="italic">deign</hi> to remind you of it? A little delirious perhaps from my recent illness.</p>
<p>Is it not very provoking to see Fortune lavishing her favours on fools; while she is such a niggard to you and I?&#x2014; In returning from Haddington to Gartmore the other day, Margaret Betson lighted on a Husband as rich as Cr&#x9c;sus. They travelled a dozen miles together in some coach; he offered her himself and his fortune four and twenty hours after and tomorrow is their wedding-day. This is &#x201C;freemasonry of souls&#x201D; with a vengeance!&#x2014; I do not envy Margaret her Glasgow Merchant; but I do think his money would have been better bestowed on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Philosopher. What do you think?</p>
<p>I am very curious to see Mrs Montagu&#x2019;s catalogue of duties: so take care that you do not light your pipe with the letter. I have heard from the &#x201C;noble Lady&#x201D; again,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a letter postmarked <date when="1825-06-13">13 June</date>, Mrs. Montagu wrote: &#x201C;There is the freshness and the freedom and the music of a mountain stream running all thro&#x2019; your letter, and I should deserve all my life to sit by a stagnant pool, or a navigable canal, if I did not feel refreshed by it.&#x2014; preserve your integrity of character, be yourself always, for you will not easily be anything better:&#x2014;and do not murmur that you have so little fellowship and do not impute this to your peculiar neighbourhood: you would be alone here, as at Haddington, or would be compelled to find your happiness as I do, from a very few. &#x2026; To be alone in London, is to have the spirit driven in upon itself, not called out by a thousand congenial delights. &#x2026; Your fine mind should not waste itself, but should re-produce itself again and again&#x2014; I know of you only that you are very lovely, and capable of being very wise, full of imagination and full of heart, but you may be a fairy, or an Empress of the olden time, or a descendant of Gulnare [heroine of Byron&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Corsair&#x201D;] or one of those Sirens of the Northern Seas, that are still heard, in the bright moonlight, but never seen, and <hi rend="italic">this</hi> you are no doubt, for you have almost turned the wisest heads I have known from Scotland, and I begin already to feel your fascination.&#x2014;<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;Why do you and I, still continue to love that strange strange being in whose existence we have no share [Edward Irving]?&#x201D; She declares that his &#x201C;words were mere air&#x201D; and that &#x201C;it is dust that we doat upon&#x201D; and adds: &#x201C;You must thank M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle for having given my life a new interest&#x2014;he owed me some recompense, for a good deal of perverseness and he has made me large amends.&#x201D;</note> and written again&#x2014; She will surely be <pb id="pg-03-344" n="03:344"/>satisfied <hi rend="italic">now</hi> that there is no worm of disappointment preying on my damask cheek;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241028-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1824-10-28">28 Oct. 1824</date></ref>.</note> for I have told her in luminous English that my heart is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in England but in Annandale! An odd communication (you will say) to be contained in my <hi rend="italic">second</hi> letter.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found unfortunately.</note> I do not know how it was; but I could not resist the ultra-German impulse to make a confidant of this new friend whom I have not seen. I already feel an affection for her which I cannot express she is so frank and kind and high-souled! so superior to all the women I have ever known! It is to be wished, however that she would not flatter at such rate. She makes such <supplied>[a]</supplied> heavenly creature of me in her last letter, that if I had not viewed myself too often in the mirror of Truth to credit her representation I should be apt to commit the folly of Narcissus and die of self love&#x2014;&#x2014; My Life is lying quietly in the Sanctum, as also modern Europe and the thirty years war<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Schiller&#x2019;s history, a gift from Carlyle.</note>&#x2014; I do nothing on the face of the earth at present, but recline on a sofa and read novels, or drive about the country in a gig. This is my Mothers prescription and I am obliged to submit for peace&#x2019;s sake. I must conclude for I am tired, and I am sure I have tired you also<supplied>[;]</supplied> better however that you should think me stupid than forgetful of you. God bless you Darling. I will try to write longer and better at another time. Meanwhile do you write and comfort me for this interruption&#x2014; I think in a month or six weeks I shall have <hi rend="italic">the</hi> kiss which you make such a work about<supplied>[.]</supplied> My kindest regards <pb id="pg-03-345" n="03:345"/>to your Mother and John. I wish he could light on some recipe in his medical books to cure my vexatious head&#x2014;</p>

<salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Meine Liebe</hi></foreign>,</salute>
<p>tho&#x2019; it is not yet above a week since the utmost speed of postage could have brought me your letter, I have begun to long for it with no little eagerness. You will forgive this supernumerary letter; and look upon it as the record of my anxieties, if it do not prove the means of removing them. I would not force you to write to me before your time, altho&#x2019; I could. A letter from you is like a little rose in the garden of love: we must wait with patience till the Sun and the dew have unclosed the bud and sent forth the leaves; not pluck it unripened, and mock the promise of its blushing fragrance. After all, why should I feel so anxious about your decision? Do I not know that you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> coming? Have you not told me so, &#x201C;unless I <hi rend="italic">rued</hi>&#x201D;? And how can <hi rend="italic">I</hi> rue? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gewiss, sie kommt</hi></foreign> [She is certainly coming]!</p>
<p>I might insult your love of me, and awaken doubts about what is not doubtful, if I made any more apologies about the rudeness, insufficiency and so forth of the accommodation you are like to meet with. Is it not my own vanity rather than my wish for your happiness that would prompt me to dilate on that &#x201C;head of method&#x201D;? Forsooth the Philosopher is afraid lest his chosen darling should find out that he is not rich enough, or of rich enough extraction; that he is in fact a sort of clodhopper, and unworthy the attention not to say affection of one like her! Poor Philosopher! he were but a young apprentice to the trade, if <hi rend="italic">these</hi> things moved him. Or do I know so little of you as to think that pomp and circumstance are essential to your comfort, that kindness and affection might not make amends for every want? Come, then, come my Darling; if you have the heart to venture, I predict that you will not repent. My Mother amuses me when she speaks of you; the other day she said: &#x201C;I <foreign>ken</foreign> how it&#x2019;ll be; she&#x2019;ll just feel as I would do if I were gawn to live wi&#x2019; Peter Paddy&#x2019;s folk [Peter is a Tipperary bandbox-maker late of this district, now alas! <foreign><hi rend="italic">sub umbris</hi></foreign>];<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Under shadows.&#x201D; The brackets here are Carlyle&#x2019;s.</note> but <pb id="pg-03-346" n="03:346"/>if she want to see <hi rend="italic">thee</hi>, she&#x2019;ll no care!&#x201D; Consider therefore if you want to see me (a sight for sore eyes truly!), and come accordingly.</p>
<p>Alick has bought you a little Irish pony at Kelton hill fair; it is of a dark ches<supplied>[t]</supplied>nut colour, and kicks occasionally. Nevertheless I will make it carry you beside me, at a gentle amble, thro&#x2019; all these moors and lanes; and we shall see the rugged face of old Annandale, and talk of all things under the sun. How many <hi rend="italic">quarrels</hi> do you think will serve us? One <hi rend="italic">per diem</hi>? Alas! that human souls have so much of the Devil in them! How could I find in my heart to say one cruel word to you? or why should those kind black eyes ever look on me with any other aspect than the melting light of love? <hi rend="italic">Richter</hi> says: &#x201C;The man should overcome by tenderness, the woman by reason&#x201D;; but this is only in the &#x201C;married state&#x201D;; in the single state, I know not how he manages, I suppose there is nothing for it but to <hi rend="italic">kiss and be agreed</hi>. By and by, it may be, we shall learn. O that we had learned, and had room to practise it! that we belonged to one another, that we lived with each other wholly, in that trustful sympathy, that oneness of souls that is the choicest gift of Heaven to mortals! My Dearest! I believe in truth &#x201C;my heart has still some foolish fondness for thee&#x201D;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>, IV, vii.</note> I do love thee in the secret of my spirit, it will be long long before I cease to love thee. Would that I could shew it, that it might reward and animate me in suitable <hi rend="italic">activity</hi>, not lie choked and mouldering in the labyrinthic depths of <hi rend="italic">speculation</hi>! Poor miserable sons of Adam! There is a spark of heavenly fire within us, an ethereal glow of Love and wisdom, for it was the breath of God that made us living souls: but we are formed of the dust of the ground, and our lot is cast on Earth, and the fire lies hid among the ashes of our fortune, or burns with a fitful twinkle, which Chance not we can foster. It makes me sad to think how very small a part we are of what we might be; how men struggle with the great trade-winds of Life, and are borne below the haven by squalls and currents which they knew not of; how they toil and strain, and are again deceived; and how at last tired Nature casts away the helm, and leaves her bark to float at random, careless to what unknown rock or shore the gloomy tide may bear it. Will affection also die at last in that inhospitable scene? Will the excellent become to us no better than the common, and the Spirit of the Universe<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Geist der Erde</hi></foreign> who speaks to Faust in vain. This spirit is the creative force. Faust listens instead to Mephistopheles, the negative, destructive force in the universe, the spirit who &#x201C;always says no&#x201D; (cf. <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, I, l. 1338).</note> with his thousand voices <pb id="pg-03-347" n="03:347"/>speak to us in vain? Alas! must the heart itself grow dull and callous, as its hopes one after the other shrink and wither? &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Armseliger Faust, ich kenne dich nicht mehr!</hi></foreign>&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Poor Faust, I know thee no more!&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, I,l. 2720.)</note></p>
<p>You perceive my preaching faculty is not a whit diminished, had I opportunity to give it scope. This place in fact is favourable for it: I have no business to accomplish, but a problem of which Experience and John Badams have already given me all the rules and limits; I only sleep eight hours of the four and twenty, and I see no living creature that abstracts me from my visions. No wonder, then, that I take &#x201C;general views.&#x201D; Sometimes unluckily they become particular enough, notwithstanding. It would edify you, for example, could you listen to one of the <hi rend="italic">auricular confessions</hi> which I hold with the Man-Within some morning before getting out of bed. What blessed anthems that gentleman does chaunt to me! With what emphasis he calls me fool, ass, blockhead; with what felicity he likens me to the Armadillo of the Tropics, a horn-cased pug of a creature that climbs some tree, and will not budge a step from it, till it has eaten every leaf and twig and even every shred of bark! I tell him that I must and will be healthy tho&#x2019; the Devil were in it; that he had better hold his tongue, that there is no use in talking&#x2014;and then spring out, and huddle on my raiment, a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> gallop round by Dalton, and so put him to silence at least to low grumbling. On the whole, I feel well that this is no scene for the heathy Philosopher whatever it may be for the sick. If ever I get well, I must leave it, and shall wish to leave it. For the present, every time I think of London and Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I feel as if in Heaven.</p>
<p>Considering all this, I wonder many a time that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have not cut me off from all part or lot in you. How in the name of wonder <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> you think of &#x201C;marrying&#x201D; me? Was it the serious purpose of your reason, or only the day-dream of your fancy? Or do you <hi rend="italic">love</hi> me, and feel that you could brave any fortune along with me? If so, my own Darling!&#x2014; But how have I deserved it? Surely there is not such faith, in the breast of another &#x201C;young lady&#x201D; in this country. You are richer than I in soul as well as in fortune; you have a belief in the omnipotence of affection, which I for some years have partly lost. God bless you, my little Jane!&#x2014; Let us study not to wreck a prospect that has in it so much of Heaven, however clogged and cumbered by the clay of Earth. I have still some faint idea that you will <hi rend="italic">rue</hi>, when you have seen me here: at times in bitter moments, I smite my foot against the ground, <pb id="pg-03-348" n="03:348"/>and swear that it were best! Oh how many thousands of things have we to ask and learn, when you arrive!</p>
<p>Now you will come for certain; and write to me very soon to that effect? Be serious; do not laugh at me, if you can help it; there is something in laughter that dries up all the channels of the heart: you are pretty (<hi rend="italic">pooty</hi>) when you mock, you are heavenly when you love and weep. Will you attend to this caution? Not a jot!</p>
<p>My Mother does not know that I am writing to you, or her &#x201C;kindest compliments&#x201D; would form a portion of my letter. She is far from well in health, and has not like me the hope of ever recovering it. <hi rend="italic">Her</hi> country is on the other side of the Stars! I were a Turk, if I did not love her.&#x2014; Jane was here the other night; she is sewing <hi rend="italic">Samplers</hi>, stitching-in names and robin-redbreasts and all sorts of mosaic needle-work. Among a crowd of vulgar initials, I asked her what the &#x201C;J. W.&#x201D; meant? Who was he? She paused; then with a look of timorous archness, answered: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s no a <hi rend="italic">he</hi> ava&#x2019; [at all]!&#x201D;&#x2014; You will write? But I am a fool to hurry you. <closer><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">A Dieu</hi></foreign>, My Dearest! I am wholly your&#x2019;s,</salute></closer></p>
<name>Th: Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>The Newspaper come<supplied>[s]</supplied> at any rate: except as a Memorial of me, I fear it is not worth the halfpenny it costs you. I look for an <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> instead.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>If ever mortal was possessed by the very Genius of Indolence, it must be your unhappy correspondent. For the last four weeks, I have almost without intermission meditated answering your kind and most welcome letter; and that easy and delightful task has never till this instant been commenced! One day I had garden-walks to trim, the next I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> ride to Seafield and bathe, the next I must read Tieck and Richter, the next&#x2014;it would be better on the morrow. &#x201C;Yet a little sleep, yet a little slumber, yet a little folding of the hands to sleep!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prov. 6:10, 24:33.</note> Surely there is not in the British Islands such a peasant slave as I.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, II, ii.</note> Work, labour, toil according to your strength! is the rigid mandate Nature <pb id="pg-03-349" n="03:349"/>gives to all men; to me too she speaks with a voice sharp as a two-edged sword; I listen, and tremble, and turn round and then&#x2014;compose myself again to rest. O my dear Madam! if you loved me, you would not praise, but <hi rend="italic">scold</hi> and threaten me. The currents of my activity are stopt and stagnating; my mind is growing flat and rude and barren as an Irish bog: woe to me if I make no effort to clear it and recover it!</p>
<p>I promised you some sketch of my manner of existence here, of what I did and meant to do; a beggarly account of empty boxes is all I have to give you. Beyond the great fundamental problem of existing, I can properly be said to have accomplished nothing since I removed hither. Yet I am happy, perhaps too happy, happier than I have been for many a year. I say to myself: &#x201C;Am I not a Patient? Is not this place my Hospital, why should I fret at being idle? Yes, my sick-bed is the amphitheatre of these everlasting mountains, and its curtains are the blue winds with their fringes of many-coloured cloud, and my sick-nurses are the kind Dreams which come to me from the vallies and the rushing waters and the pomp of Summer. Let me enjoy it while I can, and gather strength against the evil day, the day of drudgery and care, which follows close behind me!&#x201D;&#x2014; Thus can I sing myself a lullaby, and live as passively as if I were a brother of these beeches that screen me from the noon-day Sun. Ambition seems dead within me, or fallen into a deep sleep: I feel content to play no part at all in the drama of the world, to be a nothing in the vast Creation, so I might but be left to look on its magnificence, and sail on the wings of the Imagination through its bright immensities. Am I twenty years younger than I counted; again a little heedless boy, that I can so live from one hour to the other? Time no longer hurries past me like a mountain flood, the channel of which is soon to lie dead and empty: it spreads around me like a placid sea, the shores are hidden by fantastic shapes, and of its ebbs and flows I take no thought. Alas! Alas! it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> rolling onwards notwithstanding; onwards to the rocks of wor<supplied>[l]</supplied>dly difficulty and distress; onwards to the dark unsounded Straits of the Grave! I am a fool, and no philosopher: Life cannot be an Idyll any more than it can be an Epic; it is a despicable system of Book-keeping by Double Entry, and he who does not walk by Cocker&#x2019;s Arithmetic<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Cocker (<date when="1631">1631</date>&#x2013;<date when="1675">75</date>). His book on arithmetic, first published in <date when="1678">1678</date>, went into many editions, and respect for its authority gave rise to the phrase &#x201C;according to Cocker.&#x201D;</note> will never get it balanced.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-350" n="03:350"/>You are kind, and will not flout these vain fantasies; they are the children of my solitude, and represent to you this Paradise of Sloth, its roses and its poppies, with the serpent of remorse heard rustling at intervals among their roots. I should have told you in prose, that I am still sick, and gradually becoming less so; still cleaving to the Badamian law, and occupied, if at all, with the hopes of future occupation. I am here with my Mother and two Brothers (the elder a Farmer, the younger an Edinburgh Doctor brimful of honesty and zeal and logic); our quiet little cottage stands on the sunny face of a far-seen hill, the ancient watch-tower of <hi rend="italic">Repentance</hi> on a corner of the farm, and all the streams and bays and mountains from Helvellyn to Etterick Pen spread out as on a map around us. Criffel, <hi rend="italic">your</hi> old friend, still holds his giant bulk above the Solway, too often drawing on his cowl of mist, and vexing us (or rather me) with rain. I have no company except what gathers round this single hearth; but they all love me, they are all true souls, and I seek no other. I ride about on nimble horses; I go and breakfast with my Father, at Mainhill, five miles away; I watch the Sun as he sinks to rest among his hills of molten gold; I look at the green carpet of Earth, and the glittering pavement of Heaven. Pity that I am not a Bird of Paradise that can live on flowers and float on aether! This life were then a proper one. As it is&#x2014; But I will not trouble you with my regrets and resolutions. I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> betake me to that pitiful employment; I must bow myself to the oar, or else make shipwreck. Three months ago, I engaged to prepare a &#x201C;Series of Select German Novels&#x201D;: eight pages are all that I have yet translated!</p>
<p>How is it, my Dear Madam, that I burthen your patience with such ineptitudes enacted and recorded? With the details of follies which only a Mother could listen to from a beloved Son? It is that you are good, and that I&#x2014;am a poor babbler. I would fain live in your memory; and for the present there is little save my inconsistencies and errors to maintain me there<supplied>[.]</supplied> Perhaps a better time may come; perhaps I may yet meet you, when the Fiends are driven back to the Pit they came from, and their shackles are cast off me, and &#x201C;Richard is himself again.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220600-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, [<date when="1822-06">Mid-June 1822</date></ref>].</note> I live in Hope which may deceive me, and in Recollections which cannot. London with its roaring tumults are faded far away from my thoughts; but a little island still shines bright and azure thro&#x2019; the haze, a sunny spot enlightened by affection and kind feelings; the <hi rend="italic">sight</hi> of this is still mine, if the possession of it should be mine no more. Do not forget me! It is sweet for me to think that in the wide desolate <pb id="pg-03-351" n="03:351"/>world a generous heart remembers me and wishes well to me. But for this, there are hours when one might grow an infidel like the rest, and forget that any thing but vanity and love of self existed in the Earth.</p>
<p>Long ago I ought to have acknowledged with my best gratitude your pro<supplied>[mpt]</supplied> and kind compliance with the prayer of my last letter. I have not thanked you le<supplied>[ss]</supplied> that my thanks have remained unuttered in words. You have done a double fav<supplied>[our]</supplied> to me and to those dear to me. Miss Welsh understands you better than I did: she purposes &#x201C;to love you immensely,&#x201D; never having met with such feelings in any individual of her sex before. Your correspondence may improve as well as gratify her: I trust it will prove the commencement of a lasting intimacy, to be carried on in good time by some readier communication than letters. Heaven send, the &#x201C;good time&#x201D; for that and so-many other things were here!</p>
<p>Jane&#x2019;s diligence as a correspondent must throw greater shame on my delays. I know that if you used me according to my merits I should see no line from you for two Calendar months. But I hope better things;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18231022-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-10-22">22 Oct. 1823</date></ref>.</note> for you will recollect my merits less than my wants. Consider that except thro&#x2019; your means I have scarcely any tidings from a Country I have so much cause to think of; consider that tho&#x2019; a recreant to the cause of Art and Literature, and a deserter from their habitations, I have not lost care for them or curiosity about their products; above all consider that a friendly word, any tone of affection and good-will, is like cheering music heard in the still night, when it reaches me in these solitudes. Could I tempt you to write a letter as selfish as the present! I should then feel that I gave as well as received. But you seem to forget that you yourself have any feelings, any rights; except the saintly right of ministering to the sorrows and perplexities of others. How or where are you? London must be hot as Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s furnace at present; I cannot but hope that you have escaped from it to some emblem of the country, if not to the country itself. Do you come to Bolton Abbey,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Near Harrogate in Yorkshire, west of the city of York.</note> and how far is it from this? But there is no end to my questions.&#x2014; Badams has not time to write to me: did he ever get that unhappy little book? Is he with you, or at Birmingham? Tell him that I still love him, let the gold of Mexico go which way it will. Has Coleridge published his Book;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Aids to Reflection</hi> (<date when="1825">1825</date>).</note> or is he still merely <hi rend="italic">tawlk</hi>ing, and taking snuff? Unhappy Coleridge! a seventy-four-gun-ship, but <pb id="pg-03-352" n="03:352"/>water-logged, dismasted, cannot set a thread of sail! unhappy I, rather! a herring-boat almost as water-logged as he!&#x2014; Mr Irving I hear is coming home to us: I shall get news of you whether you will or not! But you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> write before then? I long to hear of all these, and a thousand things which my sheet will not hold.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Meanwhile my time is come: present my kind remembrances to Mr Montague and Emily, and believe me ever, My Dear Madam,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate friend, /</salute></closer> <name>Th. Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>Alas! alas! I lost your seal two weeks ago, in gallopping a wild Irish colt across the moor. My Brother and I examined every foot of the road; I mowed and pared the places where I mounted and dismounted; but in vain; it is gone; nothing but the little neck remains as a sad memorial of what <hi rend="italic">has been</hi>. Pity me! for I am very much vexed, tho I deserved it.</p></ps>

<p><salute>My dearest Mother&#x2014;&#x2014;</salute>Perhaps you will consider the enclosed a needless formality. It ought to have been done long since, nevertheless; and should have been done but for my dislike of talking to Mr. Donaldson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Dr. Welsh (&#x2026; [Miss Welsh&#x2019;s] Father) had died suddenly in <date when="1819">1819</date>, leaving his Widow altogether unprovided for. At the time of his death, and for some years previous, his Practice had become an unusually extensive one, for a Country Doctor; he had taken a Partner (Dr. Howden) into the business, and the firm of Welsh and Howden continued to prosper, earning amongst other things a considerable professional income. Dr. Welsh, however, had spent all his savings in purchasing Craigenputtock,&#x2014;or rather in purchasing his Brothers&#x2019; and Sisters&#x2019; prospective shares of this Estate. To accomplish this he had been obliged to borrow money; and, although at his death the title-deeds of Craigenputtock stood in his name, he owed a considerable sum to his Brother Robert. On the other hand there was, of course, a little money in the Bank, in addition to out-standing debts due to him and his Partner. The final settlement of Dr. Welsh&#x2019;s Estate, which was arrived at in <date when="1823-04">April, 1823</date>, showed a balance of &#xa3;145-12-3, due to his heirs after all debts had been paid. On submitting to Mrs. Welsh the final settlement and the accounts pertaining to it, her Family Lawyer, Mr. Alexander Donaldson, writes (on the <date when="1823-04-13">13th of April, 1823</date>): &#x2018;I subjoin an abstract of the whole: and that you may have the comfort of being out of debt, and possessed of some share of means, I enclose an Order on the Bank for the balance&#x2019; (&#xa3;145-12-3).&#x2014; Dr. Welsh having died intestate, the real estate, consisting of Craigenputtock and the house in Haddington, became, on his death, the property of his Daughter. She was thus &#x2018;an Heiress&#x2019;; but an heiress with a Mother still in the prime of life, entirely dependent upon her. The &#x2018;beautiful soul,&#x2019; as Carlyle justly calls her, generously came to her Mother&#x2019;s rescue, and sent to her, enclosed in this little Letter, a legal document which conveyed to her the unconditional ownership of the Haddington property, and made over to her &#x2018;during all the days of her lifetime, all and whole the Lands of Upper Craigenputtock&#x2019;&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> about my private affairs. This foolish feeling, which has <pb id="pg-03-353" n="03:353"/>prevented me hitherto from carrying my intention into effect, might have prevented me I believe, still longer, had I not promised to Mr. Carlyle when he was last here, that before we met again he should be delivered from the thought of loving an Heiress, a thought which is actually <hi rend="italic">painful</hi> to his proud and generous nature.</p>
<p>The inclosed Paper conveys to you the Life-rent of Craigenputtock, and places the House here and everything belonging to it at your entire disposal to sell or burn or do anything you please with (I mention this to save you the trouble of reading the three long pages in which it is expressed). In the event of my marriage, which may <hi rend="italic">possibly</hi> happen some time within the next six years, you might find it more advisable to sell than let it (for of course we will never part);&#x2014;but that is a far-away consideration.</p>
<p>I write to avoid speaking on the subject; and I will esteem it particularly kind if you will not say a word to me about it.</p>

<salute><hi rend="italic">My dear Love</hi></salute>
<p>What a miser you are of your letters, to charge the last to my account after making a show of giving it into the bargain! <foreign>Eh bien</foreign>! I have nothing for it, but to submit, in this as in all things else: &#x201C;my whole will (Mrs Montagu says) must be <hi rend="italic">thrown into fusion</hi> and cast according to another mould [fusion underscored twice].&#x201D; A barbarous process really! I wonder that the bare mention of it did not terrify me into the resolution of remaining single all the days of life&#x2014;</p>
<p>A few hurried lines however, is all that I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> bestow on you at present; being in the middle of confusion, and &#x201C;troubled about many things&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 10:41; and <ref target="volume-04/lt-18261003-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1826-10-03">3 Oct. 1826</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Tomorrow, with the blessing of God, we go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;on Saturday to Dumfriesshire; and not an article of my wardrobe is packed yet. to add to my hurry I have just got a letter from the <hi rend="italic">cidevant</hi> Margaret Betson which requires an immediate answer as it concerns the important matter of cambrick handkerchiefs&#x2014; It cannot be <pb id="pg-03-354" n="03:354"/>long now until we meet&#x2014;meet! Oh that it were never more to&#x2014;quarrel!&#x2014; I wish however that the weather were a little cooler and my health a little stronger first. I am better greatly better than I was but still &#x201C;silly&#x201D; as the people here call it; but this kicking pony and the sight of <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> will put me all to rights again I expect.</p>
<p>I am just returned from a visit (you would never guess where) at <hi rend="italic">Phantasy</hi>! This is the first fruits of my <hi rend="italic">life</hi>: it revived a number of recollections in me which softened my heart towards these Rennies<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Family of George Rennie, her former suitor.</note>&#x2014;so that when I met some of them one day by chance I made steps towards a reconciliation which were met more than half way&#x2014; We are now on the best possible terms. I am glad of it for there are few kinds of suffering which I would not endure sooner than estrangement from those I love&#x2014; and it is impossible for me ever to feel altogether indifferent to the friendships which I contracted with the trustful, sanguine enthusiasm of sixteen</p>
<p>My <hi rend="italic">money matters</hi> are all arranged and now I am as poor as yourself&#x2014;do you like me the worse that I am poor? Not you indeed! And for me I would give thousands a year instead of hundreds to buy the conviction of being loved for myself alone&#x2014; Mr. Donaldson has seen my <hi rend="italic">will</hi> too with your name written in it in great letters.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;In <date when="1824-01">January, 1824</date>, Mr. Donaldson (Mrs. Welsh&#x2019;s family lawyer), hearing that Miss Welsh was seriously ill, took it upon himself to write and warn her that in case of her dying intestate, Mrs. Welsh&#x2019;s right to her daughter&#x2019;s estate would likely be disputed. His Letter has not been preserved, but Miss Welsh&#x2019;s reply to it is as follows: &#x2018;Edinburgh, <date when="1824-01-23">23rd January, 1824</date>.&#x2014; My dear Sir,&#x2014;I feel very grateful to you for putting me in mind of a duty which I have neglected hitherto solely from ignorance of its importance. Until you Letter was put into my hands, I was not in the least aware that in the event of my death, my Mother&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> rights to my inheritance could possibly be disputed. Otherwise common-sense and natural affection would doubtless have instructed me to anticipate your friendly counsel. Now that I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> aware that such a possibility <hi rend="italic">does</hi> exist, I shall not feel comfortable in my mind as long as it is not effectually provided against.&#x2019;&#x2014; Accordingly a provisional &#x2018;Settlement&#x2019; was prepared by Mr. Donaldson, and executed by Miss Welsh on the <date when="1824-01-30">30th of January, 1824</date>. Next year she made her will leaving Craigenputtock in fee-simple to Carlyle, and at the same time, urged thereto by Carlyle himself, she executed a &#x2018;Disposition and Assignation,&#x2019; making over to her mother the Haddington House and the life-rent of Craigenputtock. The date of this latter instrument is <date when="1825-07-19">19th July, 1825</date>&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> No matter! why should I be ashamed of shewing an affection which I am not ashamed to feel&#x2014; But we will talk over all these things when we meet&#x2014; It will take all your indulgence to excuse this breathless letter&#x2014; God bless you my darling</p>

<ps><p><pb id="pg-03-355" n="03:355"/>I had <hi rend="italic">two</hi> sheets from Mrs Montagu the other day trying to prove to me that I knew nothing at all of my own heart (Mercy how romantic she is<supplied>[.)]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her letter of <date when="1825-07-03">3 July</date>, Mrs. Montagu had told Jane that although she was not a &#x201C;coquette&#x201D; when she spoke of being engaged [to Carlyle] she was &#x201C;treating of liberty, while in prison,&#x201D; because of her old affection for Edward Irving. She adds: &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyles heart is no doubt fully and deeply engaged<supplied>[.]</supplied> I, am nothing to him, and he can scarcely throw away upon me an answer to the very letter he asks me for, but <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, have affection and sympathy to spare.&#x2014; And now for advice&#x2014; This matter being clear to your own satisfaction, (and I charge you with the most solemn adjuration to look well to yourself and examine yourself strictly upon this point) I can see no disproportion in marrying a man of education a scholar and a gentleman&#x2014;it is not a thought worth a moment if your means meet your wants, &#x2026; but you have used a word that has made me a little grave, you say &#x2018;the odious details of a house&#x2019;&#x2014;this part of your character is incomplete, and must be new modelled before you can be a poor man&#x2019;s wife&#x2014;believe me nothing is odious that adds to the comfort of a man you love; a wife is noblest and highest in what most becomes a wife, the studying &#x2018;household good&#x2019;; and good works in her husband she best promotes, by making his house the scene of peace and comfort. &#x2026; it is no longer his will that commands, but your love that obeys. &#x2026; You perceive I look upon the matter as irremediable, when you once tell me that you are <hi rend="italic">engaged</hi>, but it would be cruel to one, who has known much disappointment and many sorrows, to inflict the greatest of all sorrows, to let him discover by a comparison of his own feelings with yours, that you had come to him with half a heart, and that you had mistaken compassion and the self-satisfaction of a generous act, for that sentiment which can alone sustain the mind in a struggle through life&#x2014; I must honor your Mother for her most liberal views&#x2014;but I again charge you look well to yourself&#x2014; shall I, like the old casuists<supplied>[,]</supplied> put a case to you; If any accident set our friend Edward free, if you felt that his love, had been like all well founded love, indestructible, and only in abeyance to his duty, if unknowing any <hi rend="italic">new</hi> let or hindrance he came in due time to claim one whom an adverse fate had seperated from him, how would my dear Jane&#x2019;s pulse beat then? If with the truth and frankness I expect from you, you can lay your hand upon your heart and say &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">calmly as before</hi>,&#x2019; I will say Marry then in heaven&#x2019;s name and the sooner the better.&#x201D; She added further that the opposite response in Jane would only confirm what she had a suspicion of, namely that Jane was &#x201C;under a delusion, a noble and generous one, but still a delusion, with respect to Thomas Carlyle.&#x201D;</note> write presently to Templand.</p>

<salute>My dearest</salute>
<p>I thought to write to you from this place with joy; I write with shame and tears. The enclosed letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The text of Mrs. Montagu&#x2019;s letter, postmarked <date when="1825-07-20">20 July 1825</date>, is given by A. Carlyle in <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 148&#x2013;50. She warns Jane: &#x201C;There must be no Bluebeard&#x2019;s closet in which the skeleton may one day be discovered.&#x201D; She talks of her own past life: &#x201C;Believe me my love, I owe many peaceful days and nights, to a similar disclosure, poured into the ear of a passionate and jealous man, a disclosure most painful, most humiliating.&#x2014; The particulars I will one day communicate to you;&#x2014; If this confession had not been made, how terrible would the evils have been, to which I might have been exposed and how could I have hoped to regain confidence of which I should in that case have felt myself wholly undeserving. &#x2026;&#x201D; She gives the latest news about Edward Irving: &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Irving is here again&#x2014;his Wife and Child are with her friends. &#x2026; He is very much beloved here, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Montagu (whom you would delight in), loves him entirely like a favored son&#x2014;he is now staying under our roof, where I so often entreated M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle to stay&#x2014; We would have exorcised the bitter spirit that rends him, and have cast it out for ever. You, will do this much more readily&#x2014; I have a married daughter&#x2014;the Wife of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Procter better known to you as &#x2018;Barry Cornwall&#x2019;&#x2014; I think she will be con<hi rend="italic">fined</hi> about September and that will keep me late in Town.&#x2014; If it should be otherwise, if I should be able to make out a Journey to Bolton-Abbey (near Harrowgate) could you join me there?&#x2014;it is not more than 70 miles from the Lakes, and would be a step from Dumfries<supplied>[s]</supplied>hire.&#x2014; Will you see my dear young friend whom I have never seen&#x2014;Miss Craik of Arbigland? the daughter of a woman whom I loved from her earliest infancy to the day of her sudden death three years since&#x2014;and will you see my dear Boy Charles Montagu with D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Duncan at Ruthwell<supplied>[?]</supplied> I know not where Templand is&#x2014; tho&#x2019; I have seen much of Dumfries<supplied>[s]</supplied>hire, and much of the town of Dumfries in company of my dear Robert Burns, who used to take me into the silent streets where to use his own words &#x2018;we were free of the <hi rend="italic">Red-Coats</hi> who haunted my steps&#x2019;&#x2014;for so he most familiarly abused the important personages who made my balls happy. Will you come to Bolton? and when you are safe under my protection will M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle come too? &#x2018;he hears me not he minds me not&#x2019; but he will answer and mind you.&#x201D;</note> which I found lying for me, has distracted my thoughts from the prospect of our meeting&#x2014;the brightest in my mind for many months, and fixed them on a part of my own conduct which makes me unworthy ever to see you, or be clasped to your true heart again. I cannot come to you cannot be at peace with myself: till I have made the confession which Mrs Montagu so impressively shows me the need of&#x2014; Let me tell it then out at once; I have deceived you <hi rend="italic">I</hi> whose truth and frankness you have so often praised have deceived my bosom friend! I told you that I did not care for Edward Irving, took pains to make you believe this&#x2014; It was false; <pb id="pg-03-357" n="03:357"/>I loved him&#x2014;must I say it&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">once</hi> passionately loved him&#x2014; Would to Heaven that this were all! it might not perhaps lower me much in your opinion for he is no unworthy man, and if I showed weakness in loving one whom I knew to be engaged to another, I made amends in persuading him to marry that other and preserve his honour from reproach: but I have concealed and disguised the truth: and for this I have no excuse&#x2014;none at least that would bear a moment&#x2019;s scrutiny. Woe to me then if your reason be my judge and not your love! I cannot even plead the merit of a <hi rend="italic">voluntary</hi> disclosure as a claim to your forgiveness. I make it because I <hi rend="italic">must</hi>, because this extraordinary woman has moved me to honesty whether I would or no&#x2014; Read her letter and Judge if it was possible for me to resist it.</p>
<p>Write I beseech you instantly, and let me know my fate&#x2014; This suspense is worse to endure than any certainty. Say if you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> that I may come to you&#x2014;that you will take me to your heart after all as your own, your trusted Jane and I will arrange it as soon as ever I am able&#x2014;say no&#x2014;that you no longer wish to see me that my image is defaced in your soul and I will think you <hi rend="italic">not unjust</hi> Oh that I had your answer never were you so dear as at this moment when I am in danger of losing your affection or what is still more precious to me your respect</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Your letter reached me but a few hours ago: I was doubly shocked on reading it a second time to find it dated <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi>. What a week you must have had! It were inhuman to keep you another moment in uncertainty.</p>
<p>You exaggerate this matter greatly: it is an evil, but it may be borne; we must bear it <hi rend="italic">together</hi>; what else can we do? Much of the annoyance it occasions to me proceeds from selfish sources, of a poor enough description; this is unworthy of our notice. Let it go to strengthen the schoolings of Experience, let it be another chastisement to vanity: perhaps she needs it; and if not, who is <hi rend="italic">She</hi> that I should take thought of her?</p>
<p>Nor is the other, more serious part of the mischief half so heinous in my eyes as it seems to be in yours. There was a want of firmness in <pb id="pg-03-358" n="03:358"/>withholding an avowal which you thought might give me pain, there must have been much suffering in the concealments and reservations it imposed on you: but there is a heroism in your present frankness, a fund of truth and probity, which ought to cancel all that went before. You say it was not voluntary: so much the more difficult; I honour it the more. You ask me to <hi rend="italic">forgive</hi> you, you stand humbled and weeping before me. No more of this for God&#x2019;s sake! Forgivenness! Where is the living man that dare look steadfastly into his &#x201C;painted sepulchre&#x201D; of a heart, and say: I have lived one year without committing fifty faults of a deeper dye than this? My dear Jane! My best Jane! Your soul is of a more ethereal temper than befits this very despicable world. You love truth and nobleness, you are forced to love them; and you know not how they may be reached. O God! What a heartless slave were I, if I discouraged you, for any paltry momentary interests of my own, in the sacred object you are aiming at! Believe me, My Dearest, this struggling of a pure soul to escape from the contaminations that encircle it, is but more touching to me that its success is incomplete. It is human nature in the loveliest aspect our poor Earth admits of; flesh and spirit, the clay of the ground made living by the breath of the Almighty.</p>
<p>O love truth, my Dearest, prize it beyond all fame and power and happiness! Continue to love it fearlessly, thro&#x2019; good and bad report: it is the day-star from on high that shines to us in this gloomy wilderness of existence; there is still hope of him who knows and venerates its light, and dare determine to hold fast by it to the death. Help me too to love it: I can talk more largely of it than you; but many an hour I could say with Brutus: &#x201C;Virtue, have I worshipped thee as a substance, and found thee an empty shadow?&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caryle&#x2019;s source for this quotation has not been found but cf. Euripides: &#x201C;Virtue! I have followed thee through life, and I find thee at last but a shade&#x201D; (Emerson, <hi rend="italic">Essays, First Series</hi>: &#x201C;Heroism&#x201D;).</note> It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> not so! By the majestic Universe, by the mysterious Soul of Man, it is not so! There is a worth in goodness which defies all chance. The <hi rend="italic">happy</hi> man was never yet created; the <hi rend="italic">virtuous</hi> man, tho&#x2019; clothed in rags and sinking under pain, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the jewel of the Earth, however I may doubt it, or deny it in my bitterness of heart. O never let me forget it! Teach me, tell me, when the Fiend of Suffering, and the base Spirit of the World are ready to prevail against me, and to drive me from this last stronghold!</p>
<p>You feel grateful to me that I have &#x201C;forgiven&#x201D; you? You thank me, and say I treat you generously? Alas! alas! I deserve no gratitude. What have I done? Assured you that my affection is still yours, that <pb id="pg-03-359" n="03:359"/>you are even dearer to me for this painful circumstance. But do you know the worth of that affection? Have you ever seen <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and my co<supplied>[ndi]</supplied>tion in the naked eye of your reason? You have not, you do not know me; the affection you rejoice in is worse than worthless, it is hurtful, it may be your ruin. What is my love of you or of any one? A wild peal thro&#x2019; the desolate chambers of my soul, forcing perhaps a bitter tear into my eyes, and then giving place to silence and death! You know me not; no living mortal knows me, seems to know me. I can no longer love. My heart has been steeped in solitary bitterness, till the life of it is gone: the heaven of two confiding souls that live but for each other encircled with glad affection, enlightened by the sun of worldly blessings and suitable activity is a thing that I contemplate from a far distance, without the hope, sometimes even without the wish, of reaching it. Am I not poor and sick and helpless and estranged from all men? I lie upon the thorny couch of pain, my pillow is the iron pillow of despair: I can rest on them in silence, but that is all that I can do. Think of it, Jane! I can never make you happy. Leave me, then! Why should I destroy you? It is but one bold step and it is done. We shall suffer, suffer to the heart; but we shall have obeyed the voice of reason, and time will teach us to endure it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Verschmerzen werden wirs; denn was verschmerzet nicht der Mensch?</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;To endure is our lot; for what does any man not have to endure?&#x201D; (cf. Schiller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wallensteins Tod</hi>, V, iii).</note> <hi rend="italic">No</hi> affection is unalterable or eternal: we ourselves with all our passions sink to dust, and are speedily consumed.</p>
<p>I know your generous heart: you say I will not leave this poor true-hearted brother; he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> my brother and faithful to me tho&#x2019; sinking in the waves of destiny; I will clasp him to my heart, and save him or perish with him. Alas! you know not what you do: you cannot save me; it is Fate only that can save me if I am to be saved at all. You do not know me; believe me, you would be wretched with me in a week. Save me! Make me happy!&#x2014; I smile to hear the recipe of our kind Mrs Montague. &#x201C;Exorcism&#x201D;! <supplied>[with]</supplied> a vengeance! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach, du lieber Gott</hi></foreign> [Oh, dear God]!</p>
<p>These things have long, for years, more or less distinctly, lain upon my heart<supplied>[;]</supplied> I have told you them, that I might imitate the sincerity you have so nobly set before me as a pattern. If you say they are &#x201C;blue devils&#x201D; vapours of sickness, I shall be sorry; for it will but shew me that you have not understood or believed: if you think them merely the weak querulous wailings of a distempered mind, you will do me <pb id="pg-03-360" n="03:360"/>some injustice: if you think they are pretexts and that I have ceased to love you, you will do injustice both to yourself and me. O Jane!&#x2014; But what use is it to talk? I could write forty quires on that subject, and yet not make it clear to you. You are young, you know not life, know not yourself. Secluded all your days from the native country of your spirit, you have grasped at every semblance of it: first the rude smoky fire of Edward Irving seemed to you a star of Heaven; next the quivering <foreign><hi rend="italic">ignis fatuus</hi></foreign> [will o&#x2019; the wisp] of a soul that dwells in me! The world has a thousand noble hearts in it, that you do not dream of; and you think that you will never meet another. What am I, or what is my father&#x2019;s house, that you should sacrifice yourself for me?</p>
<p>I know not whether it was good to write these things, for a spoken word is more dangerous than a whetted sword. They assume a thousand forms in my thoughts: this as near <supplied>[as]</supplied> I could paint it is a glimpse of their general aspect. At least, therefore, they are true; they seem to demand <hi rend="italic">your</hi> solemn calm deliberation, and the speedier the decision it may be the better for us both. Again and again I repeat it, you do not know me! Come and see, and determine! Let me hear you, and do you hear me. As I am, take me or refuse me: but not as I <hi rend="italic">am not</hi>; for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> will not and cannot come to good. God help us both, and show us both the way we ought to walk in!&#x2014; When will you be here? Write twice? Once pointing out the week, again appointing the day. Bid the coach leave you at Kelhead Kilns at the end of the road for Hoddam Bridge; I will be in waiting; tell me which coach you come by, for three pass every evening. All are impatient for you here: I for many reasons. When will you come? You are forever dear to me, in spite of all I say and feel. <closer><salute>God bless you my Darling! I am always &#x26; wholly yours,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My own, best, dearest Love</salute>
<p>I do believe I should have gone out of my senses, if your letter had been a day longer of coming. As it was they were obliged to put leeches on my temples to keep me quiet: they thought it was the fatigue of travelling which had made me ill again; and I did not take any pains to undeceive them. My God! what should I suffer, were I <hi rend="italic">indeed</hi> to lose your regard, when the bare apprehension discomposes me thus? Never cease to love me, Dearest! I am not worthy of you&#x2014;I know I am not: but I feel in me the power to become so, which is light in the darkness of my soul.</p>
<p>Leave you! obey the voice of reason! You know not what you say! &#x201C;Entreat me not to leave thee; or to return from following after thee, for whither thou goest I will go; and where thou lodgest I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.

<salute>My dear Johnstone,</salute>
<p>I write to you in great haste, but thinking it better so than to delay longer, lest I mar your preparations for the journey to Haddington: I rejoiced to hear that you contemplated pursuing this project: I conceive there can be little doubt of your obtaining the place, if after all examination you like it, and I still think it may be made to meet your wishes of a comfortable settlement in life as accurately as any that is likely for a long while to occur. At all events there is nothing like an ocular inspection.

<p>I never was so lazy and utterly idle in my life as I have been this whole summer. My health, I believe, is still recovering, and that consoles me.

<salute>My dear Carlyle</salute>
<p>I received your letter with the inclosed addressed to Mr Burns, which I had the pleasure of delivering to him about three weeks ago. I reached Edinburgh about mid-day; took the coach at three oclock, and arrived in Haddington about seven. I took tea at the inn and bespoke a bed. I then went to Grant&#x2019;s Braes, and knocked at the door, upon which, a clean, genteel, spare, intellectual looking figure presented himself. I speak to Mr Burns I presume; yes, at your service; at the same time stretching out his hand to receive mine, without preface apology, or explanation on either side. I was showed into the parlour, where I gave him your letter, upon reading which, he presented me to Mrs Burns, who was closing a letter at the table, as a friend of Mr Carlyle. Mrs Burn<supplied>[s]</supplied>&#x2019;s look and manner gave me the idea of a douce, honest, kind, motherly woman. We got into conversation immediately; in the course of which, the rest of the family who had been out walking, dropt in one and two at a time; and in less than three quarters of an hour, I found myself as much at home as if I had been <pb id="pg-03-365" n="03:365"/>a part of the family. I had barely left myself day light sufficient to light me into Haddington when I rose to take my leave, with a request that Mr Burn&#x2019;s would grant me half an hour&#x2019;s farther conversation sation [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] in the morning: but it seemed to have been already settled by one and all, that I should not leave Grant&#x2019;s Braes that night. You will easily conceive that it was no difficult matter to persuade me to exchange the dull sojourn at an inn for the lively conversation of an agreeable and intelligent family. I have rarely met a family whose minds were more attuned to mine. Our ideas seemed to run as smoothly together as if if [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] they had been accustomed to mingle for years. Popular education, a subje<supplied>[c]</supplied>t upon which Gilbert seems fond of talking, and upon which too he has certainly formed very rational notions, was discussed at considerable length. Then we had his son from Edinburgh, a kind, rattling, talking young man, who introduced topics connected with general literature and whig politics, with which he seemed to be a little overrun. East Lothian farming and farmers, and a variety of other subjects, occupied us till supper-time: after which I retired, accompanied by Mr John, to my bed room, where we sat talking about Edinburgh, its literature, literary characters, and institutions, till a late hour. The next day happened unluckily to be Gilbert&#x2019;s rent day. I saw less of him therefore than I could have wished: His son however accompanied me to Haddington, and introduced me to the two clergymen, both Dumfries-shire men, the one tall and slovenly, the other short and brisk as a bee&#x2014;both I believed inclined to be favourable to me with regard to the school. I had shewed my certificates of character and qualifications to Gilbert Burns, with which he expressed himself highly satisfied. I did not think of producing them to the clergymen, which Mr B. told me afterwards was an omission, as he had written particularly about them in a note which he gave me to each of these Gentlemen. We then took a view of the house which has been purchased for the &#x201C;noisy mansion&#x201D; and domicile of the parish teacher. The house is really a good one, not more than ten years old, Double, with two stories, ashler front, and iron railing before, and a walled garden, containing more than the fourth of a scotch acre in the rear. The situation is quiet and retired, as there is no thorough fare before, and the back part looks into the open country. Gilbert says the salary is not yet fixed, but he believes it will be the maximum, with the benefit of any augmentation that may take place. The lower flat is to be fitted up for the school room: and so sanguine are they of the success of the institution, that they talk of making arrangements <pb id="pg-03-366" n="03:366"/>for an assistant. The upper flat, consisting <supplied>[of]</supplied> four or five apartments, I forget which, is to accommodate <supplied>[the]</supplied> teacher. Their arrangements cannot be completed before the spring. Mr Burns and the two clergymen wish to have the teacher chosen, not so much by comparative trial, as by his certificates. I think I may depend on the suffrage of Gilbert; indeed he was pleased to say that he wondered that with such testimonials I should think of looking after such a place. I took the coach at 4 oclock, drank tea with Mitchel<supplied>[l]</supplied>, whom I found still in Edinburgh busy with his Geography, slept at Newhaven, Breakfasted with Mrs Irving, at her fathers and return<supplied>[e]</supplied>d home in the evening, from one of the most pleasant trips I have had for many years. Gilbert Burns is to write to me as soon as they are prepared for advertising. Pardon this matter of fact epistle<supplied>[.]</supplied> Give my kindest love to your father and mother<supplied>[,]</supplied> John, and all the family: write as soon as you can find time</p>

<p><salute>My dearest little Ruth!&#x2014;</salute> I owe you many thinks for your kindness of heart, for your true unflinching love of me, unworthy as I am &#x201C;by destiny or by my own deserving&#x201D; of such bounties. Your faith in me is great, greater than I ever can fulfil, or pay with due gratitude. So we are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to part! O my Darling, how could we ever part? Do we not love each other? Does not your fervid trembling spirit cleave to mine as to its pillar of hope in the darkness and tempests of life? Are not my arms about you, is not my breast your pillow? If you love me with the whole strength of that noble heart, it <hi rend="italic">were</hi> unwise in you to leave me. No, we will never part, betide what may!</p>
<p>In truth, I believe, I should not be so generous with my offers to that effect, were it not for some secret persuasion that they had little chance to be accepted. I feel as if there were no sacrifice which I could not make to see, still more to cause, your happiness; but sacrifices in idea, and sacrifices in deed are different matters; and this would in truth be a sacrifice of almost all that still binds me to the world by any tie of hope, that still tinges my sky with a streak of dawn amid the gloom that overshadows me. Who knows, too, but we may still be happy? In calm hours, hope has not yet forsaken me; for we are still <pb id="pg-03-367" n="03:367"/>in the land of the living which is the place of hope, and more perverse destinies than ours have changed to smoothness and serenity. The evil is deep and dark, but it is <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, and I see it clearly. If this accursed burden of disease were cast away, nine tenths of my faults and incapacities would pass away with it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is worth noting that much of Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;waste-land&#x201D; as he describes it in &#x201C;The Everlasting No&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> and elsewhere is made up in large part of bad health.</note> Life might still lie round me like a huge quarry; but I should have my strength to labour in it, and form its shapeless masses into an edifice. Nay perhaps this same deathlike cold eclipse under which my youth has passed away in heaviness and woe, might not be without its uses in my future fortunes, tho&#x2019; I have stormed at it as the blackest most unmingled curse with which the wrath of Heaven could have visited me. &#x201C;Ye shall become perfect thro&#x2019; sufferings,&#x201D; says the Scripture,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;After ye have suffered, make ye perfect.&#x201D; I Pet. 5:10. Cf. Heb. 2:10.</note> and Experience is beginning to shew me the truth of the maxim. Thou too, my Darling, hast thy share! Repine not at it, Jane; it is the lot of all mortals; the curse of fools, but sometimes also the blessing of the wise. How wild are our wishes, how frantic our schemes of happiness when we first enter on the world! Our hearts encircled in the delusions of vanity and self-love, we think the universe was made for us alone; we glory in the strength of our gifts, in the pride of our place; and forget that the fairest ornament of our being is &#x201C;the quality of mercy,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Merchant of Venice</hi>, IV, i.</note> the still, meek humble Love that dwells in the inmost shrine of our nature, and cannot come to light till Selfishness in all its cunning forms is banished out of us, till affliction and neglect and disappointment have sternly taught us that Self is a foundation of sand, that we, even the mighty <hi rend="italic">we</hi>, are a poor and feeble and most unimportant fraction in the general sum of Existence. Fools writhe and wriggle and rebel at this; their life is a little waspish battle against all mankind for refusing to take part with them; and their little dole of reputation and sensation, wasting more and more into a shred, is annihilated at the end of a few beggarly years, and they leave the Earth without ever feeling that the spirit of man is a child of Heaven, and has thoughts and aims in which self and its interests are lost from the eye, as the Eagle is swallowed up in the brightness of the sun, to which it soars. Let <hi rend="italic">us</hi> be wise, let us admit this painful but medicinal conviction, and meekly learn the lesson which it teaches us. O Jane! Why should we murmur? Are we not rich in better things than silver or gold, or the vain babble of <pb id="pg-03-368" n="03:368"/>stupid men? We have found each other, and our hearts are one, our beings are one; for we love each other with a love not grounded on deception but on <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>, and no force can part us, or rob us of that blessing! Heavenly affection! Heavenly trust of soul to soul! This <hi rend="italic">can</hi> soften all afflictions, if it is genuine and lasting as it is in noble hearts. The summer sunshine of joy is not its chosen place; it burns with its clearest light in the dark winter of sorrow; when heart is pressed to heart, and one has no hope but in the other, no care but for the other. Do you know this as it is? Do you dare to front it, not decked in the stage-light of the imagination, but in the squalid repulsiveness of the actual world? Then, my little Ruth, thou art a heroine, and I would not give thee for a kingdom!</p>
<p>It is thus I change from week to week, and from day to day! Heaven knows I have no wish to deceive you; but to shew you all that is in me, all my feelings and fantasies as I view the brightest or the darkest side of our fortunes. By and by you will learn what manner of man I am. As yet I sometimes scarcely know <hi rend="italic">myself.</hi></p>
<p>But now is not the time for speculations with pen and ink, since we are so soon to meet face to face! O that this were a palace of the Fairies, with rosy gardens and velvet lawns, and stately chambers full of sumptuous delights! Not an insufficient farm-cottage, surrounded with oats and cattle! You will come to it, however, and your love of me will make it pleasant. But when? when? Are you arrived at Dumfries? How long are you to loiter there? No small impatience on your account prevails here; I am asked day after day: &#x201C;Hast thou got a letter yet, and when <hi rend="italic">is</hi> she coming?&#x201D; Do come as soon as you are able: I know you will. The pony has ceased to kick, has had a serious distemper in the throat which has brought all its ill humours away, and it now munches oats and clover and ambles to and fro &#x201C;as temperate as a lamb.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle seems to have in mind &#x201C;God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,&#x201D; in George Herbert&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Jacula Prudentum</hi> (<date when="1640">1640</date>) and Sterne&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Sentimental Journey</hi> (<date when="1768">1768</date>).</note> I do believe a week or two of it would do you more good than all the Doctors of the country. Or if you want gallopping, there is Larry the flame-coloured colt will fly with you like a &#x201C;perfect&#x201D; Pegasus while his strength holds, nay leap gates and swim rivers. Besides the <hi rend="italic">clegs</hi> (gadflies) are all dead now; the &#x201C;Lammas-flood&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Lammas equals loaf-mass, or feast of the &#x2018;first fruits,&#x2019; held on the 1st of August. The Lammas-floods or &#x2018;spates&#x2019; are storms of rain and wind, generally occurring (in Scotland) in the early days of August&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> also <pb id="pg-03-369" n="03:369"/>is over, the fields are growing white for Harvest, and the season is at the finest. Come <foreign><hi rend="italic">Meine Liebe</hi></foreign> [my love]! I long to see thy fair face again, and to have that little <hi rend="italic">kiss</hi>, which by all laws human and divine belongs to me by imprescriptible right. Dost thou mean to cheat me, thou infatuated creature? I swear thou shalt not!</p>
<p>You talk of a &#x201C;day or two&#x201D;; but we will appoint no time; for this I fear will be found a very stinted allowance. A day or two! You will stand amazed here for the space of <hi rend="italic">three</hi> days and nights at least, and be unable to utter any word of intelligible import. Stay so long as you can hold it out, and then you shall go with my best blessing. Bring chin<supplied>[t]</supplied>z or drugget gowns with you, lest your silks be spoiled here; also a stock of needles. We have books for wet weather; and if you speak me fair, for the matter of ten kisses or so, I will give you a <hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen</hi> of Ludwig Tieck&#x2019;s to render into English. Besides, it seems, we have a considerable stock of <hi rend="italic">quarrels</hi> to accomplish and abolish. On the whole, I doubt not, the time will not hang very heavy on our hands. So come and try.</p>
<p>Now write to me and say when I am to look for you. If you like it any better, I will bring the ponies up to Dumfries in person some morning, and take you down with me that very evening. We are but fourteen miles off, and a carrier (to Ecclefechan) passes close by us every Thursday morning. Perhaps you will still think the coach preferable: either way you like; only do not linger. Let me hear, at any rate, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I meant to write three lines, and behold my sheet is full to the very edge! Next time, I shall be brief as a Grace before meat. I am not as the Scribes and Pharisees that think they shall be heard for their many words.&#x2014; This journey to Bolton Abbey is of no unpromising description, if it had a little more certainty. I think it would give you pleasure, tho&#x2019; perhaps far less than you anticipate, and might also do you good. The &#x201C;noble Lady&#x201D; has a spice of real nobleness in her, tho&#x2019; it is so veiled in waving folds of sentiment and rhetoric that you can never tell its quantity or quality with any accuracy. Perhaps she will teach you to&#x2014;rest. Mr Montague, I prophecy, will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> delight you. He is a good-natured carricature of a philosopher; headstrong as a mule, with immense playfulness which is not half so charming as he thinks; and Bacon, everlasting Bacon hovers in every second sentence that he utters. He and I stood aghast at one another for many months; till at last I resigned myself to fate, and was content to come and touch the worthy man as it were with the point of one of my fingers. Bolton <pb id="pg-03-370" n="03:370"/>Abbey is an inn.&#x2014; But <foreign><hi rend="italic">basta! basta!</hi></foreign> [enough! enough!]&#x2014; Write to me directly, lest I cease to love you in the interim. <closer><salute>For the present I am thine entirely,</salute></closer></p>

We were grieved to hear of your indisposition; and, as people have always most sympathy for the inflictions to which themselves are liable, we pitied you the more that your illness proceeded from bile. We hope however that the Enemy is fairly overcome and if so, my Dear, you may sing a <hi rend="italic">te Deum</hi> for your deliverance. Think of me!

Munro Somerville, of Drumelzier, an unpublished letter of Carlyle was exhibited and read. It is addressed to Mrs. Johnston of Grange, an intimate friend of the Carlyle family. Grange is in the parish of Tundergarth, near the Milk Water, about eight miles from Lockerbie. &#x2026; The apologetic reference in the postscript to &#x2018;dandy paper&#x2019; is due to the letter being written on fine notepaper with embossed margin, more fitted for a billet doux than a polite note. As Carlyle was engaged at this time to Jane Welsh, it is easy to understand why &#x2018;dandy paper&#x2019; was in use at Hoddom Hill.&#x201D; For Mr. and Mrs. Johnston and the visit which Carlyle and Jane soon paid to them, see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250902-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1825-09-02">2 Sept.</date></ref>, Carlyle&#x2019;s note.</sourceNote><head>

<salute>My Dear Madam,&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I have appeared dilatory in sending these books, because my father had lent one of them, and it was a process requiring more time than might have been expected to get it back. I must also plead guilty to keeping it about a week in my own possession after it was fairly returned to me. If the contents please, you will readily forgive me all this. I am still as indolent as ever, or very nearly so, a mere spectator of the <pb id="pg-03-372" n="03:372"/>&#x201C;tragi-comi-pastoral farce&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, II, ii.</note> of existence, or at best but a candlesnuffer, snuffing a few German rushlights, to let the actors see better how to bear themselves. In time, I doubt not, some &#x201C;secondary part&#x201D; may be given to me too, and I shall strut and bellow like the rest. For the present, the will of fate be done! If it were not for the genius of sloth I would visit Grange about twice a week. As it is, I mean some day to make a desperate pull, and try to get so far beyond <supplied>[t]</supplied>his thraldom for a little while. I have yet had, as it were, no talk with you at all: nothing but the mere preliminaries to talk. Meanwhile I beg of you to think of me sometimes, as kindly as you can: and to believe that at all times, absent or present, I am, with much respect, my dear madam, <closer><salute>your sincere friend,</salute></closer></p>
<name>Thomas Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Make my kindest compliments to Mr. Johnston; and do me the justice to believe that necessity, not choice, made me use this dandy paper.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Through him [William Graham of Burnswark] I made acquaintance with a really intellectual modest circle, or rather pair of people, a Mr. and Mrs. Johnston, at their place called &#x201C;Grange,&#x201D; on the edge of the Hill country, seven or eight miles from my Father&#x2019;s: Mrs. Johnston was a Glasgow lady, of really fine culture, manners, and intellect; one of the smallest voices, and most delicate, gently-smiling figures; had been in London, etc.; her Husband was by birth Laird of this pretty Grange; and had modestly withdrawn to it, finding merchanthood in Glasgow ruinous to weak health. The elegance, the perfect courtesy, the simple purity and beauty I found in both these good people, was an authentic attraction and profit to me in those years: and I still remember them, and that bright little environment of theirs, with a kind of pathetic affection. I as good as lost them on my leaving Annandale; Mr. Johnston soon after died; and with Mrs. Johnston there could only be at rare intervals a flying call, sometimes only the attempt at such, which amounted to little.&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 83).</note></p></ps>

<salute>My dear Madam</salute>
<p>Your son, I hope has explained to you, that I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the very uncertain person which you have had good reason to take me for; and that my delay in making out my projected visit to you has been occasioned by circumstances, over which I had no controul. At length, thank Heaven, there is no longer any obstacle to my wishes; and I purpose being with you on Thursday next, about eight in the evening.</p>
<p>You must not receive me as a stranger, remember; for I do not come with a stranger&#x2019;s feelings. Mr Carlyle has made me already acquainted with every member of his family: and no one <hi rend="italic">he</hi> loves can be indifferent to me, who have a Sisters interest in all that concerns him. Moreover you must prepare yourself to like me, if you possibly can, or your Son, I assure you will be terribly dissappointed. Say to him that he must write me two lines by Mondays post, or I shall not be sure that my letter has reached you. The address is Miss <hi rend="italic">Baillie</hi> [underscored twice] Welsh Albany Place<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<closer><salute>Yours with respect /</salute></closer> <name>Jane B Welsh</name>

<p>Kelhead Kilns (&#x201C;the purest lime in Scotland&#x201D;) are some 12 miles east<hi rend="italic">d</hi> from Dumfries, on the upper or &#x2018;new&#x2019; road from that Town to Annan and Carlisle, and London; some cottages of quarry people are scattered ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, or stand in bits of rows, here and there, around beside the great chasms and pillar of smok<supplied>[e]</supplied>; no other form of village or hovel[?] there: Hoddam Hill is two miles north by a branch-road wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> breaks off at right angles there, and goes straight for Ecclefechan, passing within few hundred yards of our door, and still closer by the old grey sandstone Tower on the crown of the Hill, before descending, as it now rapidly does, towards Annan Water (Hoddam Brig) and the beautiful green plain or valley-side, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> lies beyond, with its long avenue of big shady Beeches wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> continues to Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> above two <pb id="pg-03-374" n="03:374"/>miles off. My dear little Pilgrim dates from Dumfries, where she now was, with her three Aunts and Grandmother who had shifted thither (&#x2018;Albany Place&#x2019; there) from Penfillan, since the Grandf<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2019;s (<hi rend="italic">John</hi> Welsh&#x2019;s) death. Her regular abode, perhaps for the last month or more, was &#x2018;Templand&#x2019; near Thornhill (almost right across the river from Penfillan, at a mile&#x2019;s distance &#x26; mutually visible): at this season she was apt to be on visit there with her Mother to Grandfather <hi rend="italic">Walter</hi> and &#x2018;Aunt Jeannie,&#x2019; both of whom especially Aunt Jeannie (a very pattern of amiability, modest neatness and dexterity) she much liked. The place, a little Farm, with hardy old Farm House, thin &#x26; high, is beautifully situated on a broad knoll in the valley of the Nith; and had been trimmed, by Aunt Jeannie&#x2019;s frugal ingenuity and assiduity, into quite a beauty of a rustic Dwellinghouse with garden &#x26; appurtenances; a right pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> shelter for the old Papa!&#x2014; Poor Aunt Jeannie&#x2019;s own course in this world had been sad enough, cheerful as her air was; and she died in some 3 years more. &#x2018;Grizzie&#x2019; (Grace or Grisel, my M<hi rend="italic">r</hi>-in-law), her elder Sister, had removed to Templ<hi rend="italic">d</hi> for residence, so soon as Comley Bank Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> was ready for <hi rend="italic">us</hi> and ours; she, on Sister&#x2019;s last illness, took charge of her Father (equally skilful, equally generous, tho much less pat<supplied>[ien]</supplied><hi rend="italic">t</hi> and amenable); and continued there till her own death.</p></ps>

<p>I failed not to be ready with two swift little horses that Thursday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> at Kelhead; but I and all of us were disappointed; there came absolutely nothing; Coach swept past with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> regard for any one.

<p>These two Letters, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> turned up as if by accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, especially the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of them, which came first, and most unexpectedly, of the two, was a strangely affecting discovery to me; clear memorials, sudden, strange, of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the beautifullest weeks<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane actually stayed at Hoddam Hill from <date when="1825-09-02">2</date> to <date when="1825-09-19">19 Sept.</date>; the time, of course, seemed short to Carlyle, even in memory.</note> I ever had, and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has now fled from me so far away!&#x2014; By the best calculat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> I can make, here are the preliminary dates, preliminary and posterior, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> bear on that precious little event:</p>
<p><date when="1821-06"><hi rend="italic">June 1821</hi></date> [actually late May] (probably ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the middle of June), Edw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Irving, who was visiting &#x26; recreating ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, one of his occas<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Holiday Sallies from Glasgow, took me out to Haddington: we walked cheerily together, pleas<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> and multifariously talking, not always by the highway, but meandering at our will (as has been explained elsewhere);&#x2014;and ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> sunset of that same ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, I first saw Her who was to be so import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me thenceforth. A red dusky even<hi rend="italic">g</hi>; the sky hanging huge &#x26; high, but dim as if with dust or drought over Irving &#x26; me, as we walked home to our Lodging in the George Inn. The visit lasted 3 or 4 days; and included Gilbert Burns and other Figures, besides the one fair Figure most of all import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me. We were often in her Mother&#x2019;s house; sat talking with the two for hours, almost every ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>. I was in wretched health; had begun to be thoroughly <hi rend="italic">dyspeptic</hi> (with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Doctor to counsel me, or worse than with<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; a wise Dr might have greatly helped),&#x2014;howev<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I did my best. The beautiful, bright and earnest young Lady was intent on Literature, as the highest aim in life; and felt imprisoned in the dull elem<hi rend="italic">t</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> yielded her no commerce in that kind, and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not even yield her Books to read. I obtained permiss<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to send at least Books from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; Book-parcels nat<hi rend="italic">lly</hi> included bits of writing to and from;&#x2014;and thus an acquaintance and correspondence was begun, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had hardly ever interrupt<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and no break at all while life lasted. She was often in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on visit with her Mother, to &#x2018;Uncle Robert in Northumb<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Street,&#x2019; to &#x2018;Old Mr Bradfute in George&#x2019;s Square&#x2019;; and I had leave to call on these occasions,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I zealously enough, if not too zealously sometimes, in my awkward way, took advantage of. I was not her declared lover; nor c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> she admit me as such, in my waste &#x26; uncert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> posture of affairs &#x26; prospects: but we were becoming thoroughly acquainted with each other; and her tacit, hidden, but to me visible friendship for me was <pb id="pg-03-377" n="03:377"/>the happy island in my otherwise altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> dreary, vacant and forlorn existence in those years.</p>
<p>By &#x2018;<date when="1822-01">Jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1822</date>,&#x2019; Irving who had gone (on trial) to London a month or two before, had got me engaged as Tutor to the Bullers Charles &#x26; Arthur, on highly liberal terms: this was a gr<hi rend="italic">t</hi> lift to me, especially as both in regard to Pupils &#x26; Parents, it proved fairly a successful thing; and in [here this note breaks off.]</p>
<p>My poor <hi rend="italic">Tugurium</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A primitive hut or cabin.</note> of Hoddam Hill had kindled its household fire in May last or earlier, and been my habitat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> ever since: one of the simplest establish<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> a Writing Man, out of health, &#x26; not far <hi rend="italic">in</hi> of money, or of any other resource, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> contrive for himself in this world! But it did hitherto quite prosperously well for me, and was felt as an immense relief from the intolerable fret, noise and confusion that had gone before. Brother Alick, with a cheap little man-servant<supplied>[,]</supplied> worked the farm, on his own footing &#x26; responsibility; my dear old Mother, with one maid-ser<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, and ge<supplied>[ne]</supplied>rally with <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi> (always with her or <hi rend="italic">Jenny</hi>, my two youngest Sisters,&#x2014;Mainhill, with Father and two eldest d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, only 5 miles off, in const<hi rend="italic">t</hi> intercourse with us): Br<hi rend="italic">r</hi> John, home from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in Summer time, was usually our guest, botanizing, reading, good humouredly roving ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,&#x2014;largely arguing, too, and chopping speculative logic, when you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> indulge him. The truth is, our Cottage Farmhouse (built for poor &#x201C;Blackadder the Factor&#x201D;) was a neat enough kind of place, pretending even to something of ornamental (had its <hi rend="italic">aims</hi> in that partic<hi rend="italic">r</hi> been at all attended to, as they had <hi rend="italic">not</hi>); it was thoroughly weather-tight; had the essentials of utility, plenty of light, and at least two rooms of fair height and size most frugally but quite effectively furnished, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> served me perfectly as bedroom and sitting-room, or working-room and dining-room; and were considered as <hi rend="italic">my</hi> peculiar acquire<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and conquest in the adventure. I had ample power of riding; and largely profited by them, in the airy expanses all ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>; silent, not desert, &#x26; known to me long ago. By day and by night, I had the blessed absolute im<supplied>[m]</supplied>unity from noise; none knows how welcome to me. Within my four walls was no soul that did not love me. I had steady work too or was beginning to see it steady;&#x2014;had bargained with Tait at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, in April last, for that poor &#x201C;German Romance&#x201D; affair; and was busy, busy, reading for it, searching, modelling, considering making ready to translate. Still more import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> processes were going on in my inner man, tho&#x2019; as yet but half-consciously; <hi rend="italic">wait</hi> till they become consc<hi rend="italic">s</hi>! Truly a <hi rend="italic">Tugurium</hi> far more unfurnished <pb id="pg-03-378" n="03:378"/>might have served me on those terms. For the rest it had the finest and vastest prospect all round it I ever saw from any house: from Tyndale Fell to St Bees Head, all Cumberland as in amphitheatre unmatchable; Galloway mount<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, Moffat mount<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, Selkirk d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, Roxburgh d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>;&#x2014;nowise indiff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> ever to me, in spite of the prevail<hi rend="italic">g</hi> cant on such matters; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> always are subordinate extremely, and never supreme or near it.</p>
<p>Of course, we were all on tiptoe, expecting such a visit almost as if from the skies; and I, expectant I, was ready&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>She stayed with us above a week, happy, as was very evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, and making happy. Her demeanour among us I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> define as unsurpassable; spontaneously perfect. From the first moment, all embarrass<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, even my Mother&#x2019;s as tremulous and anxious as <hi rend="italic">she</hi> naturally was (superficially timid in the extreme, tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">only</hi> superficially), fied away with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> returning. Everybody felt the all-pervading simple grace, the perfect truth and perfect trustfulness of that beautiful, cheerful, intellig<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and sprightly creature; and everybody was put at his ease. The questionable visit was a clear success on all hands.</p>
<p>She and I went riding ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>; the weather dry and grey,&#x2014;nothing ever going wrong with us;&#x2014;my guidance taken as beyond criticism; she ready for any pace, rapid or slow; melodious talk, of course, never wanting. The country, quiet, airy wholesome, has real beauty of its kind; and in parts (Hoddam Brig, for example) is even mildly <hi rend="italic">picturesque</hi>. One ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, in that region, we had got into the &#x2018;rooky wood&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, III, ii.</note> and fine quiet Hill of <hi rend="italic">Woodcockair</hi> (mysterious to me in my childhood as the home of the rooks I saw flying overhead); we rode prosperously a pretty while; then rashly tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of gaining the summit for a grand view north<hi rend="italic">d</hi>;&#x2014;but ere long the ground became altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> stumbly; I hastily dismounted, found it to consist indeed of mere tumbled Sandstone crags overgrown with <hi rend="italic">blae</hi>-berries, and with great caution, not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> terror, led her down, who sat quite fearless, into safe tracks ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. Except once, long years ago, I had hardly ever been in mysterious Woodcockair before; and have never since been. The ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> flight of its rooks over Ecclefechan, flinging down their hoarse fitful even<hi rend="italic">g</hi>-song on us, or oftener voiceless far overhead, is one of the earliest recollect<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> of my childhood, and still beautiful to me.</p>
<p>We rode one day to Annan, dined with R. Dixon and Wife (Edward Irving&#x2019;s Sister, kind reasonable people); another day, was <hi rend="italic">chess</hi> at Hoddam Manse bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> the fine old Clergym<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Mr Yorksto<supplied>[u]</supplied>n &#x26; her (rivals at that game, in Nithsdale before now); this also was a pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> <pb id="pg-03-379" n="03:379"/>little expedit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> for both of us, tho&#x2019; in the chess part of it I played spectator only. The good M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> York<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, who had from of old been always blithe &#x26; friendly to me, was always a pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> neighb<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; collocutor. A man of almost childlike simplicity &#x26; honesty, tho&#x2019; of shrewd enough insight; a loud free laugh in him, not an unwise one, still less ever an unkind; something sonorously eloqu<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in the good man, something lofty, and as if, nat<hi rend="italic">lly</hi> not theologically pious and rev<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,&#x2014;eloqu<hi rend="italic">t</hi> sonorous voice withal; pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to hear, passively, in his pulpit, as I had sometimes done. He stood above six feet high, straight up, spontaneously perpendic<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; had been used to walk to and from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (distance 73 miles) in a day.</p>
<p>Perhaps our nicest expedit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> was that to <hi rend="italic">The Grange</hi>, a pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> little islet of a <hi rend="italic">Lairdship</hi> nine or 10 miles away, north<hi rend="italic">d</hi> among the sleek Sheep Hills; whose <hi rend="italic">Laird</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Leddy</hi> (Mr &#x26; Mrs Johnston, the latter a <hi rend="italic">Newbigging</hi> from Glasgow) were persons of real politeness and refine<hi rend="italic">t</hi>;&#x2014;pretty much my one <hi rend="italic">visiting</hi> place in Annandale in those years. We rode up by Castle Milk, and the pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> quiet valley of Milk, on one of those two Saturdays (for there must have been two, if my guess years-<hi rend="italic">date</hi> to that bit of pencilling is exact?);&#x2014;we staid overnight; and rode home next morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, by Dalbate, Dunaby Hope, and Waterbeck; a most still and pretty ride, as I still remember. The Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> small contribut<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to Hoddam Kirk, slowly wending thitherw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> tog<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, were the only people we had to disturb, even by a momentary transit.&#x2014; Of course she went to Mainhill,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I don&#x2019;t recollect? Cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> enough she made complete acquaintance with my Father (whom she much esteemed and even admired now and henceforth, a <hi rend="italic">reciprocal</hi> feeling, strange enough!), and with my two eldest Sisters, Marg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x26; Mary,&#x2014;who now officially &#x2018;kept house&#x2019; with Father there. On the whole, she made clear acquaintance with us all; saw, face to face, us, and the rugged peas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> element and way of life we had;&#x2014;&#x26; was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> afraid of it; but recognized like her noble self, what of intrinsic worth it might have, what of real human dignity. She charmed all hearts; and was herself visibly glad and happy,&#x2014;right loth to end those halcyon days; 8 or perhaps 9, the utmost appointed sum of them. As I rode with her to Dumfries, she did not attempt to conceal her sorrow;&#x2014;and indeed our prospect ahead was cloudy enough. I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> only say, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Esperons, esperons</hi></foreign>. To her the Haddingt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> &#x26;c element had grown dreary barren and unfruitful; no geniality of life possible there; and, I doubt not, many petty frets and contradictions. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Esperons</hi></foreign>, my Dearest, <foreign><hi rend="italic">esperons</hi></foreign>. We left our horses at the Commercial-Inn door; I walked <pb id="pg-03-380" n="03:380"/>with her, not in gay mood either, to Albany Place, and there on her Grandm<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2019;s threshold, had to say Farewell. In my whole life I can recollect no week so like a <hi rend="italic">Sabbath</hi> as that had been to me; clear, peaceful, mournfully beautiful; blessed and as if sacred!&#x2014;</p></ps>

<dateline>Tuesday night [<date when="1825-09-20">20 September 1825</date>]</dateline>
<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I cannot lie down to sleep until I have <hi rend="italic">written</hi> the farewell and the blessing which I was cruelly prevented from speaking. Oh what a sad heart is mine this night! and yours too, I know, is sad; and I cannot comfort you! cannot kiss away the gloom from your brow! Miles of distance are already betwixt us, and when we shall meet again, and where, and how God only knows. Best, dearest love! what I would give to have you here&#x2014;within my arms for one, one moment! to part so from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>! to go on our dreary separate ways without exchanging one word of comfort! Oh God! this <hi rend="italic">is</hi> falling from the azure heaven on the miry earth! When shall I be so happy again as I have been in these last weeks? I dare not look into the future&#x2014;hope seems dead within me. Write my darling and speak consolation if you can. I am very desolate</p>
<p>There is nothing here but confusion and disquiet. It was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> Robert<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Welsh, her uncle.</note> whom we say. but he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> still staying in the house, and tho it were possible to avoid him here I have the prospect of meeting him at Boreland<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Her Uncle George Welsh&#x2019;s farm near Southwick, Galloway&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> on Friday! My Grand-Mother and Aunts have been lecturing to me at great length on the impropriety of &#x201C;shunning so near a relation like a pestilence&#x201D;&#x2014;and I have born<supplied>[e]</supplied> it all with patience tho&#x2019; they might have spared themselves the pains. I needed no instructions of theirs to point out the best to be done in my present circumstances. My resolution was taken before I crossed their threshold to shake hands with my Uncle if he were so disposed. if not to treat him as a stranger who had done me no injury. I shall meet him tomorrow morning, I suppose, at breakfast. What matters it whom I meet so long as I am parted from you?</p>
<p>George was here today and departed only an hour before I arrived&#x2014; He cannot come again till Thursday. This is all very cross. I found <pb id="pg-03-381" n="03:381"/>a letter (very kind) from my Mother awaiting me. and two others which I have not had heart to read yet. She makes no comment on my visit to Hoddam hill whatever; but approves of the rest of my arrangements which is so far good. Give my kindest regards to your Mother and all the rest. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">While I live or think or love</hi>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The quotation is from a little verse of farewell addressed to Miss Welsh, on her leaving Hoddam Hill (<date when="1825-09-19">19 September</date>), by the little poetess Jean Carlyle: &#x2018;May Heaven guide thee, dearest Friend! / May Fortune sweetly smile on thee! / And while I live or think or love, / Thou shalt be still as dear to me!&#x2019;&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note). For Carlyle&#x2019;s own poem written at the time, see A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 354&#x2013;55.</note> I shall retain a grateful recollection of their good will and good offices towards me altho&#x2019; I could not articulate one word on the subject at parting&#x2014; God Almighty bless you Soul of my existence! I shall think of you every hour till we meet again<supplied>[.]</supplied> In sadness and perplexities we part; but we love each other and in this we are more blessed than millions&#x2014; <closer><salute>Farewell! I am</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your own Jane for ever / and ever</salute></closer>
<ps><p>[In margins:] Day is returned but I shall not see you.&#x2014; No one is waiting for me in the breakfast parlour with glad kind looks. Alas Alas the sab<supplied>[b]</supplied>ath weeks are past and gone! Write on Wednesday&#x2014; I shall not enjoy one happy moment till then&#x2014; I am yours. Oh that you knew how wholly yours.</p></ps>

<p>Here am <supplied>[I]</supplied> writing again in a bookseller&#x2019;s shop. I have been thro all the milliners in Dumfries in search of a decent looking cap to send to your kindhearted Mother by way of pattern but there is nothing forthcoming that she would consent to wear&#x2014;even for my sake. <foreign>N&#x2019;importe</foreign>!

<salute>My dearest</salute>
<p>I wish I may not tire you with letters; but to day I write on business and in the greatest possible haste the gig being waiting for me at the door</p>
<p>I had a letter from my Mother yesterday full of confusion worse confounded regarding the letting of Craigenputtock. She has had two offers for it in my absence and seemed quite undecided w<supplied>[h]</supplied>ether to accept them or not&#x2014; If there is any chance of your Brother taking it <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would prefer <hi rend="italic">him</hi> infinitely, before any other man. and acordingly I wrote off to my Mother instantly begging her to come under no engagement until he had looked at the place and made up his mind. Her answer is just arrived and very obliging&#x2014; She is quite willing to let the matter rest till she hears farther from me so pray ride over to Craigenputtock as soon as possible and tell me if Alick really <hi rend="italic">wishes</hi> to have the place and what he is willing to give for it&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> will not tell you what the others have offered that he may go entirely, on his own Judgement&#x2014; Write on Wednesday all about it or <hi rend="italic">see</hi> me. I do not know what time I shall get into town or where I shall be but I will leave my address at the commercial Inn as soon as I arrive&#x2014; Come my Angel&#x2014;business will be an excuse for my seeing you again.</p>
<p>I was never so hurried or so fatigued in my life&#x2014; <closer><salute>God Almighty bless you<supplied>[.]</supplied> I am ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I hope you pity me for this painful disappointment, which I suffer in common with yourself. At present I am quite unfit for coming; ever <pb id="pg-03-383" n="03:383"/>since you saw me I have been much sicker than usual; I am drowned in drugs, and one of the dreariest personages in this side of the County. Perhaps I might be able to set out to-morrow; but that also is uncertain: so fearing that you may become anxious about me, I am despatching this by the Annan Post, which last resource will itself fail in a few moments.</p>
<p>Guess my hurry and perplexity and chagrin. Write to me to-morrow; and if possible contrive some errand for me still. I had many verbal explanations and so forth about this same lease:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Of Craigenputtock, for which an offer in his father&#x2019;s name is enclosed in this Letter. Mrs. Welsh had bound herself to accept the highest offer, and James Carlyle&#x2019;s being less than Blacklock&#x2019;s, the latter was preferred&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note). James Carlyle&#x2019;s offer for Craigenputtoch was not low. His letter to Mrs. Welsh follows:<lb/><lb/>
Mainhill <date when="1825-10-01">1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> October 1825</date>.<lb/><lb/>
Madam,<lb/>
Having understood that your farm of Craigenputtock is to be let, I have taken a view of the place, and beg leave to make you the following offer for it:<lb/><lb/>
On a lease of nineteen years, provided the house and grounds are put in what is reckoned tenantable order, I will engage to pay you a rent of &#xa3;215 per annum.<lb/><lb/>
By tenantable order I mean such a state of things about the farm as would render it fit for immediate occupation, and as I should be obliged to leave it in at the end of the lease. The Dwelling-house would require to be finished and made water-tight; the Threshing-mill to be repaired; the two large Drains to be cleared; and the Fences to be mended where they have failed; and a Gate to be put on each of the fields.<lb/><lb/>
If on these terms you can let me have the farm, I shall be happy to become your tenant,<lb/><lb/>
I remain, / Madam, / Your Most Ob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Serv<hi rend="italic">t</hi> James Carlyle<lb/><lb/>
To Mrs. Welsh.<lb/><lb/>
[This letter is in Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s hand, and it is highly probable that he composed it.]</note> if your Mother thinks this offer worth attending to I may, in spite of all this, still come and see you about Thursday. Write Angel! I am very unhappy; but I love you as my life, and far more.</p>
<p>Mrs. Johnstone<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of the Grange.</note> has sent you her verses, at least such I suppose is <supplied>[the]</supplied> packet she inclosed to me the other day. All here, from the youngest to the oldest send you their heartiest love. <closer><salute>God bless you! I am your own forever.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dearest.</salute>
<p>I would have answered your letter yesterday as you desired; only my Mother was in such perplexity about this unhappy farm of hers, that she required a day to consider what was best to be done. The result of her delibera<supplied>[tions]</supplied> you will find on the foregoing page,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Welsh&#x2019;s letter, which follows:

<salute>Dear Sir /</salute>
<p>I received your offer for Craigenputtock and as things have turned out regret you were put to the trouble of looking at it. From what my Daughter mentioned one would have been most happy to have had you for a Tenant, but having promised to give it to the highest unexceptionable bidder I was bound in honor to do so, and have accordingly concluded a bargain with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Blacklock.</p>
<closer><salute>I remain Dear Sir your Obliged /</salute></closer> <name>Grace Welsh</name></note> on which I forbear to make any commentary. You may believe I was never more vexed and angry in <supplied>[my]</supplied> life; however it is <hi rend="italic">some</hi> consolation that I have all the disappointment to myself, for, to your Father and the rest it will hardly be a matter of regret that they are not to wear out nineteen <supplied>[years]</supplied> of their existence on the dreariest spot of the whole world.</p>
<p>And you have been sick too! Oh me! and I not near to nurse and comfort you! But I am thankful it was no worse. I did not know what to think. All Monday I sat at the window looking out for you; and when night came, I could not sleep for my foolish forebodings<supplied>[.]</supplied> On Tuesday the same observations were repeated with &#x201C;hope defer<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed which maketh the heart sick.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Hope deferred maketh the heart sick&#x201D; (Prov. 13:12).</note> so that by the time your letter arrived I was half distracted with fear of I knew not what disaster<supplied>[.]</supplied> Oh Dearest! anxiety is fearfully multiplied to me since my existence was connected with yours; yet I do not wish it otherwise; for it is better to suffer with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, than to be happy alone&#x2014; Are you well again and will you still come? You need not want for an errand; there is Mrs Johnston&#x2019;s packet, too precious to be intrusted to Notman, and &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">stumme Liebe</hi></foreign>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Mus&#xE4;us, which she and Carlyle were translating and which would be published as &#x201C;Dumb Love&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>.</note> if <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is not sufficient. Come Darling! my Grandfather and Aunt will give you no freezing reception. I have prepared them to like you; and they <hi rend="italic">will</hi> like you, provided you do not play the <pb id="pg-03-385" n="03:385"/><hi rend="italic">Etourdi</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Blunderer</hi>, a reference to Moli&#xE8;re&#x2019;s play.</note> as usual, and counteract my pains.

But there is another person here, whose heart&#x2019;s-welcome will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> fail you, and for her single sake you would come, tho&#x2019; the chances of enjoyment to yourself were even fewer than they are. You will be here then&#x2014;when? On Monday? We will look for you at dinner unless you write before that time.</p>

<p>If you cannot be <supplied>[here]</supplied> before three on Monday do not fail to write by the first post. I have had quite enough of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bootless</hi>&#x201D; expectation.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Shakespeare, &#x201C;Sonnet 29.&#x201D;</note></p></ps>

<salute>My dear Mrs Carlyle</salute>
<p>Mr Carlyle has heard from me so often since we parted, that writing to any one else of the family seemed superfluous. But I am not by any means unmindful of my promise to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>; and purpose sending you a long letter at no distant day.&#x2014; In the meantime my Friend will tell you all about me;&#x2014;how shockingly I look, and how discontented I am, and various other particulars which you may care to know; and, moreover, he will give you a piece of muslin for a gown (provided he does not lose it on the road) which I send in the hope that, while it lasts, it will sometimes bring me to your remembrance. I wish you may not think the pattern over-gay; but I noticed that you looked best in <pb id="pg-03-386" n="03:386"/>a light colour. Nevertheless should you dislike the thing, on no account wear it; but give it to Mag who is young enough for all the hues of the rainbow<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Later on in London, Jane Carlyle achieved a reputation for impeccable taste in clothes. Margaret was twenty-two in <date when="1825">1825</date>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>It was exceedingly vexatious that we did not meet on the fair-day, in Dumfries&#x2014; Had I been my own mistress, I would have made a point of seeking you out; but on that occasion as on too many others, I was subject to a bondage which you who live out of the cold ceremony of towns are happily ignorant of. Let us hope that it will not be always thus!</p>
<p>Now that the harvest is concluded, you must not fail in your promise, to let Jane have leisure for her Latin lessons. You know &#x201C;she is good for nothing else,&#x201D; and <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, I am confident, will be of use to her. Were it but permitted me to take charge of her education myself! Such an arrangement, in my present circumstances, is out of the question, but perhaps it may be managed at some future time&#x2014; I do not despair&#x2014;</p>
<p>God bless you all&#x2014; I am going far from you; and who knows when we shall meet again? But wherever I go, I shall never cease to rem<supplied>[ember]</supplied> dear Annandale, and the friends I have left behind, with so much regret. In the words of the song (as Dr Waugh would say) &#x201C;Nor change o&#x2019; place nor change o&#x2019; folk can <foreign>gar</foreign> [make] my fancy <foreign>gee</foreign> [swerve]&#x201D; And with this assurance I remain yours truly</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>It is now a week since I lost you, and time that I should have recourse to writing, the poor substitute for that lively interchange of feelings which we can now enjoy no longer. Let us be thankful that <pb id="pg-03-388" n="03:388"/>this inadequate expedient is not taken from us also! That we are still living, still near each other; still obstinately hoping that brighter days await us, that a day will come when we shall part no more!</p>
<p>I predicted, without great gifts of prophecy, that I should be sad when parted from you; and I am sorry to say that my prediction has been fully realized. I had a melancholy journey home that day, by the graves of my Ancestors,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;On his way home from Templand, Carlyle would probably pass close by the battleground of Dryfe Sands (<date when="1593">1593</date>), where the Carlyles and the Johnstones fought side by side victoriously against the powerful family of Maxwells. Many fell on both sides. I remember once driving with Carlyle past these Sands, and he gave me a history of the battle in considerable detail and in touching and graphic words.&#x2014; The ancient burying-ground of the Carlyle family was Penner-saughs, half a mile or so from Ecclefechan, and on the side remote from Templand&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> with the thoughts of bygone joys for my companions! Your dreary silent walk by my side, your mute parting kiss, the tear that I saw hanging in your long black eyelashes when I went away, all hung like a black cloud over my remembrances, and withdrew the sunshine from the scenes we had lately seen together in such peace and gladness. But wherefore should a living man complain? If we have joy, we <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have sorrow; if we are not <foreign>wae</foreign> to part, how should we be blithe to meet? There is a misery beyond the sharpest parting sadness; the misery of a heart grown dead to sadness as to joy; that loves not, fears not, hopes not, but sits amid utter desolation, reckless of all farther ravages. This also I have felt; I ought rather to rejoice that I feel it no longer.</p>
<p>Since my return and settlement, the case is but little mended. I have been taking some glimpses into the Books of Conscience; and in truth I find a weighty balance standing there against me. What am I to do, or to attempt? How am I again to mingle in the coarse turmoil of men, and gather from their selfishness and harsh contradiction the means of happiness? And thou, too, my kind, trustful Jane! My poverty, and all my wealth! O why should I be as a broken reed, and wound the hand that leans on me! But this is useless murmuring: if aught can be done, let us do it quickly; if not, let nothing at least be said. It is not evil but the shadow of evil which affrights me. Things are not worse but better than they were. It is only that I am parted from you, and that old &#x201C;October Tirl-the-trees&#x201D; is riding on his furious blast, and bringing desolation to the world within as to the world without. The summer with his glory has left me, and the rosy clouds of imagination in which I lay asleep are passing with him, and I look down upon the naked barrenness of my destiny as it is, not (let me hope) to bewail <pb id="pg-03-389" n="03:389"/>it, or curse it, but to front its earnest difficulties with all the strength and craft that is in me. Up! Up! Thou sluggard! Not to plan but to execute what is already planned however pitiful!&#x2014; I have worked two days honestly at Tieck; in other ten, I hope to be done with him, and perhaps attempting something better. Fear not utterly, my darling! There are moments when with thee against my heart, I feel more than match for whatever can befal us. Life is yet all before us, and many proud hours when we shall withstand in true and closest affection all its storms and perils, and be more to one another than all the universe besides.</p>
<p>The fire is blazing in the room, and the rain is raging vainly without the window; but <hi rend="italic">she</hi> with the long black curling locks is not here! Nothing but Jack with his history of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Arzneikunde</hi></foreign> [Medicine], and I with my lazy pen, sitting front to front in silence. How altered and forlorn! Yet I am far from regretting that you came, and made a blank among us by your absence. I never knew so much of you before, my soul was never so united to yours, never saw it face to face, and dared to love it as now. Let us trust that these &#x201C;sabbath-weeks&#x201D; were but an emblem of the long sabbath-years we are to spend together forever and ever! One would think they might be made as happy; but that were an error.</p>
<p>I am tattling very sadly, yet I must continue for a little. My Mother&#x2019;s thanks were boundless when she saw your kind remembrance of her; she will wear the gown come what come may, and think of you I doubt not every time she puts it on. Alick&#x2019;s purse brought a grateful smile over the features of the rugged husbandman: he is up with it to-day at Dumfries, perhaps at Dabton, beside you, in treaty with <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Major<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Major Crichton, factor to the Duke of Queensberry. Dabton, the factor&#x2019;s residence, is about a mile north of Thornhill, some two miles from Templand&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> for the farm of Shawbrae. Jack pursues his moral philosophy with the same broad placidity as ever; he has changed his celebrated moral aphorism lately; and now declares that: &#x201C;There is nothing but <hi rend="italic">a mixture</hi> of good and evil in the world, Mother&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251114-JBW-MAC-01">TC&#x2019;s note, <sic>p. 412</sic><corr>JBW to MAC, <date when="1825-11-14">14 Nov.</date></corr></ref>.</note> a truth which I think obtains as little patronage as its predecessor. He bids me send you his kindest regards.</p>
<p>On Sunday I had a letter from Robert Dickson of Annan, informing me that his brother-in-law<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving. His fifteen-month-old son, also Edward, had died on <date when="1825-10-11">11 October</date> at Kirkcaldy, where Mrs. Irving had been staying with her parents while Irving was in London. A daughter Margaret had been born on <date when="1825-10-02">2 October</date>. In a letter to his wife Irving says of his meeting with Carlyle that he &#x201C;came down and edified me very much of his discourse.&#x201D; M. O. W. Oliphant, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Edward Irving</hi> (<date when="1862">1862</date>), I, 252.</note> was to &#x201C;pass thro&#x2019;&#x201D; the place on Thursday, <pb id="pg-03-390" n="03:390"/>and wished to see me then. His poor little boy Edward is dead! I grieve for the good Orator and still more for his wife; for their hearts were set upon the child. To-morrow I go down to meet him; as I conjecture, for a few minutes. This does seem a perverse arrangement; but the man is married, and belongs to Isabella. &#x201C;Let us pity the poor white man,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The poor white man, faint and weary, came and sat under our tree. He has no mother to bring him milk&#x2014;no wife to grind his corn.

Who knows but the case may be his own? <supplied>[a rap over the knuckles; and exit,&#x2014;till to-morrow.]</supplied></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Friday-morning.</hi>&#x2014;I was interrupted on Wednesday-night by a rap over the knuckles, and a call to supper; and till this moment I have never been able to resume my operations. Yesterday, I went down with Alick (going to the Annan fair) to meet the Orator according to appointment. I found him sitting in his Father&#x2019;s little parlour, among a crowd of cousins and admirers, of whom he soon shook himself loose, to go and stroll among the fields with me. The sight of the poor Orator mollified my heart, and his cordial welcome awoke in me some old feelings which late events have been doing much to extinguish. He is sallow and care-worn; his boy died of hooping-cough about a week ago, a few days after his wife (who was not once allowed to see the little sufferer!) had brought him a daughter. Yet he bears these things wonderfully; his vivacity has not forsaken him; he talks with undiminished eagerness about the &#x201C;spirit of the Gospel&#x201D; and &#x201C;the mind of man&#x201D;; now and then as our dialogue proceeded he even laughed with all his ancient vehemence. I will not judge harshly of this strange man. He has a heart with many virtues; and tho&#x2019; overgrown with still ranker weeds than formerly of what in another I should call cant and affectation, it ill becomes me to forget the noble plants that flourish in the midst of them. I was sad to the very heart when I saw him step out of his Father&#x2019;s little quiet room, to dash once more into the great billowy sea of life. I walked with him two miles on the Carlisle road by the light of the moon; he was going towards Dornock to see an uncle, and await the coach for London: we parted in the howling of the north-wind, and I turned back across the moors <pb id="pg-03-391" n="03:391"/>to Hoddam Hill to meditate in silence on the chances and changes of this strange whirlpool of a world.</p>
<p>The inclosed letter he said he had written two days before the unexpected death of his child. He had purposed to visit you at Templand along with me; and hoped that we should have much happiness together. Be not too severe upon the man! He merits some love from you: as men go, there are a thousand worse for one better.</p>
<p>I saw young Montague likewise at Annan. Be thankful that you did not go to visit this untoward cub! I never in my life <supplied>[saw]</supplied> a human biped of a more doure and sinister humour. Duncan<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. Henry Duncan of Ruthwell.</note> &#x201C;for the want of proper accommodation,&#x201D; means to part with him at New-year&#x2019;s day: Charles pokes his lip, and curls his little snub nose, and cannot determine what to do. The other day he wrote to me, to go to Bolton Abbey and join his Father and Badams. For certain I was to go! For certain I wrote a letter and did not go an inch.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter, dated <date when="1825-10-15">15 Oct.</date>, found too late to be placed chronologically, is at the end of vol. IV.</note></p>
<p>Irving and I had some talk about the London University. It seems he had been a party in some of the conferences which the Utilitarians had carried on with the Religionists; he was even a committee-man at one time; but left the concern &#x201C;because religion was not cared for.&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving later denounced London University as &#x201C;the Synagogue of Satan.&#x201D; See A. L. Drummond, <hi rend="italic">Edward Irving and His Circle</hi> (London, <date when="1935">1935</date>), p. 120.</note> I have, still some faint thoughts of looking after some appointment there; and some faint idea that I might succeed: but there is nothing fixed yet. You shall hear directly if any thing occur.</p>
<p>You cannot get this letter till Saturday-night. I grieve for the dissappointment you will suffer, if you chance before then to get into the expecting vein. I might have sent it yesterday; but without news of the orator I thought it would more irritate than satisfy your curiosity. Be not anxious about me or yourself, my own Jane! We love one another, and the most precious part of our happiness is out of the power of Fortune.&#x2014; You will write to me next week, and &#x201C;tell me all you know?&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Tell our Brother John to write us, / And to tell us all he knows: / At present I can only thank him / For the Book he sent with those.&#x201D; Little Jean Carlyle to her brother Thomas, quoted by A.

To Carlyle on <date when="1825-08-15">15 Aug.</date> Mrs. Montagu wrote: &#x201C;Your position is changed&#x2014; I no longer see you, like your gifted and ill-fated countryman, Robert Burns, with an ardent desire for such distinction as the Muses can give, and a lofty contempt for all other distinctions, a heart full of the tenderest affections, with a caustic temper and manner the most repulsive, a vague consciousness of talents never made the most of&#x2014;wandering by your native streams with a full heart, and no answering heart to listen to its out-pourings!&#x2014; Your position is indeed changed, and you are changed too, if I could now see you&#x2014; The sympathies of your nature which you swathed with your prejudices &#x2019;till one might as soon hope to reach the heart of an embalmed Egyptian, will now unfold themselves,&#x2014;I will not heap words upon you, but I, who was so often chilled by your apparent apathy, may be allowed to cheer myself with the thought of an awakened spirit which has burst the bonds of death and the grave. &#x2026; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving is now writing at my table, where I see him and hear him many hours every day.&#x2014; the little cloud that seperated us has passed away, and I have once more the satisfaction of confiding is him entirely&#x2014; He is going to Scotland to be at Kirkcalday by the 9th Sep<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Irving&#x2019;s Birthday)&#x2014; He has gathered strength in the quiet and seclusion of our house, where all love, and all cherish him&#x2014; Coleridge we hear once a week&#x2014; with a certainty that the river of his talk runs on, and will for ever run whether we are absent or present&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving drinks of the stream and is refreshed, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Montagu hears it murmur, and sleeps,&#x2014; I have a letter from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Duncan [of Ruthwell] who says &#x2018;would you believe Tom Carlyle has never been to see M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Duncan&#x2019;&#x2014;dear good woman, I can believe it very readily&#x2014; Will he go to Bolton to meet M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Montagu?&#x201D; Edward Irving adds a brief note to this letter.<lb/><lb/>
On <date when="1825-10-18">18 Oct.</date> she wrote to Jane: &#x201C;The little neat Lady-like characters [of Jane&#x2019;s handwriting] which move in steady columns like well practised soldiers [delight her]. &#x2026; perhaps the most flattering circumstance to me that has attended our correspondence is the resemblance that your hand is acquiring to mine;&#x2014;I must believe that you think of me, and often, and kindly, or this would not be so.&#x2014;<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;Our poor friend Edward Irving has lost his little Boy, the first born, of whom he was very fond&#x2014; Will you tell this to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle that he may write to him and comfort him&#x2014; The Child must have died suddenly, nine days after the birth of his little girl, a fine healthy black-eyed baby who promises to be very like her Father:&#x2014;it was most providential that the Mother was safe, and recovering or this sad event might have been fatal to both M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Irving and her Infant<supplied>[.]</supplied> He writes to me in a state of distress that is awful, and seems quite overwhelmed by the unexpectedness of the stroke&#x2014; He will be at home on Saturday next, and I know it was his purpose to have seen you, but all his purposes have been defeated&#x2014; Poor little baby, he was very quick and intelligent, but decidedly sickly, and likely to continue so. &#x2026; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle ought not to have stept in between you and your kind intention [to visit Bolton Abbey] with his absolute &#x2018;shall not<supplied>[.]</supplied>&#x2019; Nay more, he ought himself to have seen my Boy [Charles Montagu, whom Carlyle had seen]&#x2014;how many miles I should have gone willingly to pleasure him, or ought belonging to him!&#x2014;but a man is always&#x2014; a man&#x2014;a fine animal in his way, but selfish withal.&#x2014; And he finds so little Echo in his own heart to sentiments purely <hi rend="italic">un</hi>-selfish that nothing remains for him but to doubt that such things are&#x2014;half his life he is the slave of his doubts, and the other half&#x2014;the dupe of his affections&#x2014; Now that you are fairly engaged I wish that you were married do not waste your life in the endeavour to fit circumstances to your fancy, but fit your fancy to circumstances&#x2014; You have cast off the fictitious, and the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> is attended with few wants&#x2014; You have a simpler mind than M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, and he will scarcely credit the unaffected pleasure that you feel in the habits of rural life.&#x201D;<lb/><lb/>
Mrs. Edward Strachey in her letter to Carlyle of Sept. provided some commentary: &#x201C;I am grieved for our friend M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving that he is not yet out of such bad hands [Mrs. Montagu&#x2019;s]&#x2014; The very worst I really believe that he could have fallen into. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving requires all helps from without &#x26; from within to check the exuberance of his Imagination.&#x201D;</note></p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Your letter was very consolatory to me; and much do I stand in need of consolation: for since you departed this life, I have been the forlornest, most dispirited of creatures. &#x201C;What can be worse than to dwell here, driven out from bliss,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 85&#x2013;86.</note> amid wind and whist and ill-humour? <hi rend="italic">Is there any livelier image of hell?</hi> Oh Time bring the roses<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >German proverb.</note> as fast as you can; for the winter of our discontent<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi>, I, i.</note> is ill to bear!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-03-394" n="03:394"/>It was on the day after your departure, that the storm, which has been brewing in my Mother&#x2019;s mind for many weeks, broke forth in copious eloquence. Oh mercy! what cruel, unreasonable things she said; but nothing distressed me so much as her bitter reflections against you, whom she accused of having &#x201C;bewitched and poisoned my mind.&#x201D; She was unjust, I told her; my connection with so wise and honourable a man could be attended with no ill consequence; and, any way, such language, <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, was out of time,&#x2014;particularly, since it was with her knowledge and consent, that I had come to look upon you as my partner for life. She sulked for four and twenty hours, and then wrote me a long epistle; wherein she demonstrated (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> by geometrical reasonings) that I was utterly lost to all sense of duty; and took much bootless pains to explain the inconsistency of her conduct towards <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. &#x201C;She <hi rend="italic">had</hi>, indeed, given her consent to our union&#x201D; (she said) &#x201C;when you should have made yourself <hi rend="italic">a name and a situation in life</hi> [entire phrase underscored twice]; but only because I asked it, with tears, <hi rend="italic">upon my bended knees</hi>, at a time, too, <hi rend="italic">when my life seemed precarious!!</hi>&#x201D; (to the best of my recollection I was enjoying tolerable health)<supplied>[.]</supplied> &#x201C;Afterwards, however, when you came to Haddington, when she watched your temper, and perceived its <hi rend="italic">effect</hi> upon me, it was then her soul was torn &#x26;c &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x201D; &#x201C;A pack of damned nonsense, the whole of it!<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> &#x201C;Temper!&#x201D; &#x201C;effect!&#x201D; Truly, she has seen her own temper have a hundred times worse effects upon me than ever yours had, without being troubled with such tender solicitude. No! my own Darling! we shall not be parted on this account. Your irritability is the very natural consequence of continual suffering; when you are well, and happy (oh that you were!) you will be the best humoured man alive. And tho&#x2019; you should never be good-humoured, what then? Do we not love each other? And what is love if it can not make all rough places smooth! <foreign>Nein</foreign>! I am not afraid that my happiness will be wrecked upon this rock; nor is my Mother either if the truth were told. I could lay my life this grand objection never entered her head, till she was sitting with the pen in her hand, hunting after an excuse for so much caprice.&#x2014; Another cause of offence is my intimacy with Mrs Montagu, &#x201C;a woman whom I never saw, whom I know nothing about, and for whom nevertheless I have the most unbounded love and admiration&#x201D;&#x2014; Now Heaven grant me patience! for this would have made Job himself cry &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Damnation</hi>&#x201D;! and gallop half a mile! What! my honest esteem for a clever, high-minded woman, who has offered herself to me as a friend, with the most captivating grace and frankness, is to be looked <pb id="pg-03-395" n="03:395"/>upon and persecuted as a heinous fault! But it is to no purpose! I will go on corresponding with Mrs Montagu as long as I have ink and paper; and no man, woman or child shall prevent me from loving and admiring her as ardently as I please. You too, my Dearest, I will continue to love and admire tho&#x2019; the whole Earth should blame my choice; for I know in whom I have put my trust, and my resolution is s<supplied>[t]</supplied>eadfast as a rock&#x2014; I have told this to my Mother, once for all, in a tone of decision, which should prevent further remonstrance&#x2014;</p>
<p>Nevertheless I am any thing but insensible to her displeasure; and rather than be under it I would make every sacrifice consistent with reason. But it would be folly to make myself the slave of her variable humour&#x2014; Oh it is heart-breaking, shocking, to live in this manner, with one to whom I am bound by the holiest tie! deprived of her sympathy in the matters which lie next my heart! obliged to be silent on my dearest hopes, except when I am called upon to defend them! How different it would be, if there were that cordial, trustful affection betwixt us which ought to be betwixt parent and child!&#x2014;but, alas! alas! we understand each other no more!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle says that Jane greatly magnifies her mother&#x2019;s faults here and that she greatly magnified Carlyle&#x2019;s in her later life (<hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 18on.).</note></p>
<p>What will become of me until I have you again? Tell our worthy Doctor to write me out a recipe for patience, the stock which I received from Nature being well nigh exhausted, or converted into <hi rend="italic">furor</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;<foreign>Furor fit laesa saepius patientia</foreign>&#x201D;</hi>: &#x201C;Patience too often abused becomes madness&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Publilii Syri Sententiae</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sayings of Publilius Syrus</hi>, Saying 203).</note>&#x2014; Our departure has been already talked of for one week; in another, perhaps, with the blessing of God, it may be executed&#x2014;but decision is a thing which has nought to do with <hi rend="italic">our</hi> proceedings&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have had an answer from Mrs Montagu full of rhetoric, and kindness: but no matter for the rhetoric! She is good to me; and charity covereth a multitude of sins&#x2014; She says &#x201C;Mr Carlyle ought not to have stept in between you and your kind intention; nay more, he ought himself to have seen my boy&#x2014; How many miles I should have gone willingly to pleasure him or ought belonging to him!&#x2014; But a man is always&#x2014;a Man&#x2014;a fine animal in his way, yet selfish <hi rend="italic">withal</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; Do now lay this to heart &#x201C;Dear&#x201D;; and be tolerant of Mr Charles, <hi rend="italic">cub</hi> altho&#x2019; he be&#x2014;</p>
<p>So Edward Irving is gone! gone without seeing me! Well! <hi rend="italic">times are changed and we are changed in them!</hi>&#x2014;but it matters not!&#x2014; I pity the poor man for the loss of his little boy; it is well, however, that he bears it so manfully. According to Mrs Montagu&#x2019;s account of the <pb id="pg-03-396" n="03:396"/>matter, I was imagining him <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;in the most awful distress</hi>, quite <hi rend="italic">overwhelmed by the sudden stroke&#x201D;</hi>: but our fair friend is a lover of the pictureesque&#x2014; You might have read his letter to me, <foreign><hi rend="italic">en passant</hi></foreign>, a constrained, affected, extraordinary performance as may be! Poor Edward! poor white man! Let us pity him, as you observe, and be thankful!&#x2014;&#x2014;Oh Lord!</p>
<p>I was interrupted yesterday by furious rapping at the door&#x2014; It was my Lancer-Cousin!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Captain James Baillie.</note> arrived in a fine emblazoned chariot with four horses; and all glittering in jewels, from the gold pendant of his rosecoloured cap, to the ruby buckles of his slippers. You never saw such a man! He is, if possible more Adonis-like, witty, and elegant than ever. Such an air! such a voice! such a profusion of little dogs! I wish, in my heart, he were returned, to the place whence he came; for I will confess to you, dear friend, that&#x2014;you have not the slightest cause to be jealous&#x2014;jealous!&#x2014;oh mercy! when I compare this fine gentleman with the <hi rend="italic">man</hi> I love; what is he after all? A mere painted butterfly, fluttering over the flowery surface of the Earth&#x2014;the creature of a sunshiny day! while he&#x2014;my own&#x2014;is like to the royal Eagle, who soars aloft thro&#x2019; the regions of ether, and feasts his eye on the glories of the sun. <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Zwey unvertr&#xE4;glichere Gegentheile fand die Natur in ihrem Umkreis nicht&#x201D;</hi></foreign>!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Two more irreconcilable opposites were not found in the realm of nature&#x201D; (Schiller, <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos</hi>, I, ii).</note>&#x2014;but &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ohe jam satis</hi></foreign>!&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Ohe!

<p>We have had another visitor of an altogether different species&#x2014; the old woman of Craigenputtock, who came riding on the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">ill, <foreign>thrawn</foreign></hi> [stubborn, misshapen] <hi rend="italic">beast</hi>,&#x201D; bringing &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a wee compliment</hi>&#x201D; along with her, in the shape of a pair of black, silk mittens. Poor old Nany! she had got them, I suppose, at some funeral, and laid them by, to make me <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> for a whole evening.</p>
<p>Pity you did not see Dr Badams! and ten thousand pities Dr Badams did not see me! Suppose, now, that Mrs Montagu and I had been of the party; and that your friend had fallen in love with me, and rolled on the floor.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As Dugald Gilchrist did in his grief and disappointment when Jane rejected his proposal.</note> I could never, certainly, have withstood such a demonstration; but must have gone off to Birmingham on the spot&#x2014; and what would Mr Wisdom<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle himself.</note> have said then?&#x2014;that &#x201C;I <hi rend="italic">was squirting a syringe in the face of an admantine rock</hi>&#x201D;? or would he not rather <pb id="pg-03-397" n="03:397"/>have rolled upon the floor in his turn?

<p><salute>My dear Johnstone&#x2014;</salute>I was last night assisting at the late but jovial celebration of the Mainhill <hi rend="italic">Kirn</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harvest home festival.</note> and happened among other members of the party to meet with honest Gavin of Bogside,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Home of the Johnstons not far from Mainhill. Gavin is the brother of James Johnston.</note> one of whose first announcements was that he had a few days ago had a letter from you, containing compliments to me, and a memento that in the article of correspondence I was your debtor. This I had for some time known, and felt with proper repentance, and purposes of alteration; Gavin&#x2019;s hint falls in timefully with a slight interval in my occupation; and today I mean to clear scores.</p>
<p>Your last letter<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1825-09-03">3 Sept.</date></note> with the news of your Haddington journey found me in a season of busy dissipation, but was cordially welcomed, and afforded true satisfaction, I may say, to every individual of the family. We all rejoice in your prospects of a settlement, and feel great confidence that you will succeed both in obtaining and happily conducting the employment. In Haddington and its neighbourhood you will find many worthy persons of the stamp you like; among whom you will be able to fix down, as in a home, and feel yourself &#x201C;a man among your fellow-men.&#x201D; Gilbert Burns I regard as a most estimable character; and I think you may now count on his forwarding your object by all means in his power, as well as rendering it agreeable to you should you attain it. I am told that he has far more to say in the affair than any other. I will give you more introductions should you go to settle there; and in a short time you will need none. Brown the late Burgher Preacher has left that quarter, and come to settle at Moffat; so that the coast is now clear. Let us rejoice in the prospect of any luck at all, in this most magnificent earth; and &#x201C;be thankful,&#x201D; as the late Mr. <pb id="pg-03-399" n="03:399"/>M&#x2019;Leod of Brownknowe was wont to say, &#x201C;that we are not in Purgatory&#x201D;!</p>
<p>Of my own history since you left these parts, I need say but little. Few persons in the British Isles have spent an idler summer than I, and it is long since I spent one as happy. Basil Montagu of London wishes it to be written on his tombstone that he was &#x201C;a lover of all quiet things&#x201D;; but in my opinion I (and several snails) may with justice dispute him the pre-eminence in this distinction. I have done, thought, felt, or spoken very little since I saw you. At times I get into a Highland anger at this arrangement; and of late I have begun to change it a little; but on the whole I think it prudent to content myself with my present modicum of even negative good fortune, and like a prudent Christian to <foreign><hi rend="italic">jook</hi></foreign> [duck] <hi rend="italic">and let the jaw</hi> [wave] <hi rend="italic">gae by</hi>, however hard my stance may be, so it but even moderately shelter me. I believe myself to be improving in point of health; and with health I calculate that many other blessings will be restored to me. I have been at school for many years under the tuition of a pedagogue called Fate; he is an excellent teacher, but his fees are very high, and his <hi rend="italic">tawse</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">tawse</hi> or <hi rend="italic">strap</hi> is a strip of heavy leather split at one end used in Scottish schools to administer corporal punishment on the hand.</note> are rather heavy. By and by I shall become a good child, and the old knave will cease to flog me.</p>
<p>We live here on our hill-top enjoying a degree of solitude that might content the great Zimmermann<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Georg von Zimmermann (<date when="1728">1728</date>&#x2013;<date when="1795">95</date>), Swiss physician and philosopher, author of <hi rend="italic">Von der Einsamkeit (Concerning Solitude)</hi> (<date when="1756">1756</date>).</note> himself. Few mortals come to visit us, I go to visit none; I have not even once been down at Ruthwell since my return to Scotland! No news, literary, political, or economical, get at us; except perhaps a transient hint of the Stagshaw or Falkirk Tryst, or a note of jubilee at the present <hi rend="italic">fairish</hi> prices of oats and barley. Like Gallio<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Junius Annaeus Gallio, Roman proconsul, brother of Seneca. He dismissed the Jews&#x2019; accusations against Paul. &#x201C;And Gallio cared for none of those things&#x201D; (Acts 18:17).</note> of old I care for none of these things.

<p>Edward Irving was in Annan last week for a little while; and I passed half a day with him. He is of a green hue, solemn, sad, and in bad bodily condition. The worthy man (for so he is, when every say is said) has lost his boy at Kirkcaldy, and left his wife there, who had brought him a daughter only ten days before that event. He bears it well; for his heart is full of other wondrous things, from which he draws peculiar consolation. He seems, as his enemies would say, still madder than before. But it is not madness: would to Heaven we were all thus mad! He is about publishing another Book, or Prophecy. Irving is actually one of the memorabilia of this century.</p>
<p>In the last <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> you would find a critique of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, apparently by Jeffrey himself.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >LXXX (<date when="1825-08">Aug.</date>), 409&#x2013;49; and in Jeffrey&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Contributions to the Edinburgh Review</hi> (London, <date when="1853">1853</date>), pp. 120&#x2013;42.</note> It amused me not a little; and, I may say, gratified me too. I think the critic very honest, and very seldom unjust in his feeling of individual passages; but for the general whole, which constitutes the essence of a work like this, he seems to have no manner of idea of it, except as a heap of beautiful and ugly fragments. True criticism, thanks to our Reviews and Magazines, bids fair to become one of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">artes perdit&#xe6;</hi></foreign> [lost arts] ere long: And then&#x2014;&#x201C;then joy old England raise,&#x201D; for thy mob of gentlemen<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221223-TC-DH-01">TC to DH, <date when="1822-12-23">23 Dec. 1822</date></ref>.</note> will have halcyon times, goose feathers will rise in value, and paper will again be manufactured from straw! Jeffrey&#x2019;s little theory of Goethe is an exquisite affair. Yet Jeffrey is an honest and clever man, and by far the best of them all.</p>
<p>Gavin tells us you are coming down to Annandale this winter; my only prayer is, come soon. John, who is sitting by me, hopes to see you as you pass through Edinburgh, and sends you his best regards. All the rest salute you kindly. John has been very busy all summer, and is to leave us in a week or two. Write when you have any time, at large and at length.&#x2014; <closer><salute>I am, ever your affectionate friend,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I might have sent you up those borrowed Books ere now; for, except one, I had done with them all some considerable time ago; but I waited till I should find an opportunity of sending them commodiously and safely. My Brother is about setting out for College; he will deliver them to you the week after next. I write at present to consult with you about the object they were meant to serve; and to request that if possible you would have a farther supply of materials in readiness against the time of my Brother&#x2019;s arrival. I have been extremely idle all summer; and now when the wild weather is come, I am grown outrageously diligent.</p>
<p>Our Literary Project, in the course of my reading and inquiring and considering about it, has begun to assume a more settled form in my mind of late, tho&#x2019; as yet I have scarcely half a volume of the work in readiness. Out of all these forty tomes I gleaned nothing printable, except a few choice pieces from the <hi rend="italic">Phantasus</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Tieck</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ludwig Tieck (<date when="1773">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853">1853</date>). Carlyle writes of Tieck: &#x201C;In <date when="1812">1812</date>, appeared his early <hi rend="italic">Volksm&#xE4;hrchen</hi>, retouched and improved, and combined into a whole, by conversations, critical, disquisitionary and descriptive, in two volumes, entitled <hi rend="italic">Phantasus</hi>; from which our present specimens of him are taken.&#x201D; &#x201C;Ludwig Tieck,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">German Romance, Works</hi>, XXI, 263.</note> My future progress however will be far easier. I have made investigations and received advices; and if once the material were lying on my table, fairly settled and cut up for translating, I should not mind tho&#x2019; the printing were ready to commence.</p>
<p>I wrote to London to a Friend,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Crabb Robinson. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250429-TC-HCR-01">TC to HCR, <date when="1825-04-29">29 April</date></ref>.</note> who has lived long in Germany, and is on terms of intimacy with several of the Literati of that country, and with <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the friends of German literature in England. He dissuades me strongly from meddling with <hi rend="italic">Werter</hi>; says it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> translated from the original some years ago in London, by one Render,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. Render (London, <date when="1801">1801</date>).</note> and met with no encouragement; the world being already overflowed with the spurious copies, and perhaps little able to appreciate the superiority of the real ones. I suspect Render to be a foreigner, and that his translation was bad. However, I confess my own opinion very much agrees with that of my friend in this matter. Curiosity is dead on the <pb id="pg-03-402" n="03:402"/>subject of <hi rend="italic">Werter</hi>; and really notwithstanding all its popularity it is among the poorest performances of Goethe. I had worked off a sheet or two of it; but gave it up in a sort of disgust. I think it will answer much better to take <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Wanderjahre</hi> once for all, and fill a volume with this Master of German novellists. As a story Wilhelm Meister is incomplete and uninteresting; but it binds together a mass of fine little tales and disquisitions; and the book on the whole has the breath of eternal life within it; and will be read and re-read when millions of others that are making such a stir beside it now are quiet as the last year&#x2019;s Almanack. There is also a strange little <hi rend="italic">tale</hi> by Goethe, which Schlegel calls the &#x201C;tale of all tales&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Das M&#xE4;hrchen.&#x201D; Carlyle&#x2019;s translation, first published as &#x201C;The Tale&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, <date when="1832-10">Oct. 1832</date>, is also in his <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 454&#x2013;77. See also <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, XXVI, 196.</note> tho&#x2019; I doubt whether it will ever make a fortune in England, I am translating it at present. These two I think, should make the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> and best volume of the three.</p>
<p>For the First Volume I propose a selection from the five volumes of <hi rend="italic">Mus&#xE4;us</hi>&#x2019; &#x201C;Popular Tales,&#x201D; which I already have in my possession; the &#x201C;Tales&#x201D; of <hi rend="italic">Tieck</hi>, which I have already translated; and perhaps the <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi> of <hi rend="italic">La Motte Fouqu&#xE9;</hi>, tho this, both as being at present in English, and the work of no very first-rate man, is not at all a prime favourite with me. However by reason of his popularity I think it would be well to admit him, and <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sintram</hi> might be as good a specimen as any. His wife the Baroness, with <hi rend="italic">Claurens</hi> and a whole host of such small deer, I am strictly cautioned<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Robinson.</note> to exclude altogether, and indeed in the present series I do not see where we can make room for any of them. There is one <hi rend="italic">Madame Naubert</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christiane B&#xE9;n&#xE9;dicte Eug&#xE9;nie Naubert (<date when="1755">1755</date>&#x2013;<date when="1819">1819</date>), highly productive and popular German novelist.</note>, however, who is vehemently praised by B&#xfc;sching<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anton Friedrich B&#xfc;sching (<date when="1724">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1793">93</date>).</note> as an excellent narrator of &#x201C;popular tales&#x201D;; her collection I should be very happy to see; a few tales from it would make a <hi rend="italic">uniform</hi> and perhaps very interesting thing of our first volume. Her <hi rend="italic">Volksm&#xE4;hrchen</hi> [Folk tales] is marked in Fleischer&#x2019;s<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Georg Friedrich Fleischer (<date when="1794">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863">1863</date>) and Gerhard Fleischer both were booksellers at Leipzig at this time. Gerhard&#x2019;s son Ernst (d. <date when="1832">1832</date>) traveled to Paris and London before-taking over the book business in <date when="1829">1829</date>.</note> catalogue; but I suppose it would be impossible to borrow it, and it is hardly worth buying.</p>
<p>For the Second Volume I must have <hi rend="italic">Richter</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lafontaine</hi> and <pb id="pg-03-403" n="03:403"/><hi rend="italic">Hoffmann</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">La Motte Fouqu&#xE9;</hi>, if by the fortunate procurement of this <hi rend="italic">Mad. Naubert</hi> we could exclude the Baron from the first volume. <hi rend="italic">Richter</hi> is an indispensable person; by a good many degrees the strangest and most gifted novellist, or indeed writer of his country, except Goethe, and quite unknown here. His <hi rend="italic">Schmelzles Reise nach Fl&#xE4;tz</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Des Feldpredigers Schmelzle Reise nach Fl&#xE4;tz</hi> (<date when="1809">1809</date>), by Jean Paul Friedrich Richter (<date when="1763">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825">1825</date>).</note> from all that I can learn appears to be the only work of his that will suit us. Those in the Advocates&#x2019; Library will not do; and his best work <hi rend="italic">Titan</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published between <date when="1800">1800</date> and <date when="1803">1803</date>.</note> is in four volumes. This, however, with the <hi rend="italic">Unsichtbare Loge</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published in <date when="1792">1792</date>.</note> and the <hi rend="italic">Leben Q. Fixlein</hi>,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published in <date when="1796">1796</date>.</note> or any of them, I should be very glad if you could procure for me to read. The <hi rend="italic">Schmelzle&#x2019;s Reise</hi> you must buy for me, if no better may be; for Richter is a man we absolutely cannot do without, and <hi rend="italic">Schmelzle</hi> I understand to be the best of his smaller works. My London friend, writing from the oral report of a German critic whom he had consulted, calls it <hi rend="italic">Reise des Feldprediger&#x2019;s Schmelzer</hi><note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For his translation Carlyle uses the title: &#x201C;Army-Chaplain&#x2019;s Schmelzle&#x2019;s Journey to Flaetz.&#x201D;</note> [<hi rend="italic">Schmelzer</hi> underscored twice], adding that it is &#x201C;delightful&#x201D;; but in the title I think he must be mistaken, tho&#x2019; in ordering it, if you have it to order, it might be well to mention both. The former is in <hi rend="italic">Fleischer</hi>, and cheap.&#x2014; Of <hi rend="italic">Lafontaine</hi><note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >August Heinrich Julius Lafontaine (<date when="1758">1758</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831">1831</date>), German clergyman and novelist, wrote over two hundred novels and sketches dealing with middle-class life. Cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250429-TC-HCR-01">TC to HCR, <date when="1825-04-29">29 April</date></ref>.</note> (whose works amount to four-score volumes) I know not well what to make. His best small work is the &#x201C;Moral tales&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Moralische Erz&#xE4;hlungen</hi>), from which something might be extracted, if I had it; and the best of all his works, I am told, is the <hi rend="italic">Familie von Halden</hi>, which I fear would be too large, yet I long very much to see it.&#x2014; From <hi rend="italic">Hoffmann</hi><note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann (<date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822">1822</date>), German composer, music critic, and fiction writer, author of <hi rend="italic">Die Serapionsbr&#xfc;der</hi>, 4 vols. (<date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821">21</date>). Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Golden Pot&#x201D; [<hi rend="italic">Der goldne Topf</hi>] is translated from his <hi rend="italic">Fantasiest&#xfc;cke in Callots Manier</hi> (<date when="1814">1814</date>; many later editions).</note> I want some portions of his <hi rend="italic">Serapions br&#xfc;der</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fantasiest&#xfc;cke</hi>. Gillies<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably R. P. Gillies of Edinburgh. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240302-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1824-03-02">2 March 1824</date></ref>.</note> must have both Lafontaine and him: it is pity one could not borrow them from him; I should return them without any injury</p>
<p>There is another Book, <hi rend="italic">Maler M&#xfc;ller&#x2019;s</hi><note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich M&#xfc;ller (<date when="1749">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825">1825</date>), called &#x201C;Maler M&#xfc;ller,&#x201D; German poet, painter, and engraver.</note> works, which I <hi rend="italic">particularly</hi> <pb id="pg-03-404" n="03:404"/>wish to see: I am told on the best authority that he is full of genius and originality. One or two of his pieces, from my present notion of him, I imagine would be well worth inserting. I rely upon your diligence to procure it for me if possible.</p>
<p>Thus, my dear Sir, have I laid the matter before you as it stands at present with myself. If I had these books ready by me, I should reckon the undertaking half completed. Perhaps it may not be so difficult to obtain at least a perusal of them. Most, nay all of them, are marketable works, and I could read, without injuring, them. By your commercial connexions I trust you may be able to procure me the greater part of them: I shall expect your tidings on the subject soon; at latest when my Brother comes. The works I want most and must buy if they are not otherwise to be had are Richter&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Schmelzle</hi>, and Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Wanderjahre. Maler M&#xfc;ller</hi> too I have such faith in that I should almost risk him also. He is utterly unknown in this country, and highly recommended by Tieck, Richter, and others. The rest of the works I have mentioned, I must one way or another contrive to see likewise; but I do not think them worth buying, as except for this undertaking I would not purchase them at sixpence the waggon-load.</p>
<p>By a careful selection and elaboration of these materials, I feel considerably confident that we shall make a Book, worthy to be avowed in the face of day, and differing a good deal from the common ware which is imported in such quantities from Germany. <hi rend="italic">Get me the books if possible</hi>; and tell me every thing about the printing, publishing &#x26;c; for I am very anxious to get along with my utmost speed. <closer><salute>Make my best compliments to your Brother,<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>, 4 vols., was published in <date when="1827">1827</date> by William Tait, Prince&#x2019;s Street, Edinburgh, and his brother Charles Tait, Fleet Street, London.</note> and believe me always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I thank you heartily for your long good-humoured letter, and for the august mandate smuggled into the Newspaper, the behest of <pb id="pg-03-405" n="03:405"/>which I proceed with all despatch and submission to fulfil. In spite of your <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Verdammniss&#x201D;</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Damnation&#x201D;</hi>], I will not think you utterly unhappy at Templand. The resources of the gallant Lancer cannot be exhausted already: be content with him, like a good prudent girl, for a day or two; and think that long before Eternity is done, you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be delivered from <hi rend="italic">that</hi> sort of grievances. Yet I am not without sympathy for your distresses, opposite as they are to my own; on the contrary I feel them more and more deeply and distinctly every day, and pray with more and more earnestness that the time were come which <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to &#x201C;bring the roses,&#x201D; and free us both from such vile durance forever. Our <hi rend="italic">will</hi> is not submitted to our <hi rend="italic">conscience</hi>; so we are not even calm, to say nothing of happy. I lie helpless and unrestful, one part of me sunk in the mire, while the other part is struggling towards the third Heaven; there is no unity in my condition; and you, still more helpless and unrestful, are constrained to stand in silence, amid multiplied obstructions and contradictions, watching the progress of my struggles. Let us be patient and resolute, and trust in ourselves and each other! I maintain that the weal of every human being, not perhaps his enjoyment or his suffering, but his true and highest welfare, lies within himself. O that we had wisdom to put this weighty truth in practice! That we could think with resolute calmness, and decide with rigorously active steadfastness; to know our duty (for a duty every living creature has), and do it with our whole heart and our whole soul! This is the everlasting rock of man&#x2019;s security; against which no tempest or flood shall prevail. This is the true feeling of the Poet and the Sage, which I never understood till lately, which many never understand at all: &#x201C;sufficiently provided for <hi rend="italic">within</hi>,&#x201D; the outward gifts or amercements of Fortune are but the soft or the hard materials out of which he is to build his fairest work of art, a life worthy of himself and the vocation wherewith he is called.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi>; Carlyle&#x2019;s translation, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIII, 444: &#x201C;Man&#x2019;s highest merit always is as much as possible to rule external circumstances, and as little as possible to let himself be ruled by them.&#x201D;</note> But I am verging towards <hi rend="italic">cant</hi>; so I shall hasten to the right-about.</p>
<p>Your Mother is not wise or just in spoiling the stinted enjoyments of your present way of life by the reflexions and remonstrances with which she pursues you. Her views of me and my connection with you I cannot greatly blame; they coincide too nearly with my own. But what, one might ask her, does she mean you to <hi rend="italic">do</hi>? Anything? If so, it were better that she simply proposed it, and backed it out by all attainable reasons in simplicity and quiet; that if just and fit, you <pb id="pg-03-406" n="03:406"/>might go thro&#x2019; with it at all haps and hazards, instantly and completely. If nothing, then silence is the least that can be asked of her. Speech that leads not to action, still more that hinders it, is a nuisance on the Earth. Let <hi rend="italic">us</hi> remember this, as well as call on others to remember it! But after all where is the mighty grief? <hi rend="italic">Is</hi> it ruin for you to think of giving yourself to me, here as I am, in the naked undissembled meanness of my actual state? Consider this, with a cold clear eye, not in the purple light of love,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gray, &#x201C;Progress of Poesy,&#x201D; I, iii, 17.</note> but in the sharp chill light of prudence: if your mind still have any wavering, follow the truth fearlessly, not heeding <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, for I am ready with alacrity to forward your anticipated happiness in any way. Or was this your love of me no girlish whim, but the calm deliberate self-offering of a woman to the man whom her reason and her heart had made choice of? Then is it a crime in you to love me, whose you are in the sight of God and men? Can you love me <hi rend="italic">too</hi> much? Love me, my Dearest, and let the devil and the world chatter over it as they like!</p>
<p>This story of my temper is not worth much. I actually do not think myself an ill-natured man, nor even, all things considered, very ill-tempered! Really it is wearisome to think of these things. What counsel to give you I know not. Submission has its limits; when not based on conviction it degenerates into hypocrisy, and encourages demands which perhaps ought to be resisted. But in asserting your rights be meek and reasonable; carefully avoid the faults that offend you in the other. Above all, do not cease to love your Mother, and to sweeten her days for her by every method in your power. What is this caprice and sullenness to you, but unhappiness in herself; an effort to increase her own scanty stock of satisfaction at your expence, or rather to shift a portion of her own suffering upon you? She <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> cease to love you; and this is saying much. For me I beg of you to take no thought: her anger at me, her aversion to me, shall never be remembered against her. They do not irritate me: why should they? She thinks of me in the main to the full as highly as she ought; and these gusts of unreasonable caprice should be met by increased equability and steady forgiving self-possession; as angry gusts of wind are rendered harmless, not by other conflicting gusts, but by a solid wall of stone and mortar. Think of this, and do it, my good Jane! For you it is far far harder than for me; but this is one of your <hi rend="italic">duties</hi>, and it will bring its own reward.</p>
<p>Of <hi rend="italic">the Hill</hi> or myself I have little good to tell you. I finished <hi rend="italic">Tieck</hi> <pb id="pg-03-407" n="03:407"/>ten days ago; and then rested for half a week, till I grew so savage that I was forced to begin one of Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;Tale of Tales,&#x201D; which A. Carlyle says TC gave to Jane after he had translated it.</note> with which I am more than half done. This Publication must henceforth proceed with spirit! I have written to Tait for fresh materials, having now well nigh determined what pieces are to be selected and how they are to be arranged. Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</hi> I intend to make the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> volume of the book; Mus&#xE4;us and Tieck and some other the <hi rend="italic">first</hi>; Richter, Hoffmann M&#xfc;ller &#x26;c the second. I feel some satisfaction in this arrangement, and shall proceed with stern assiduity if possible till it is done. What is the use of this loitering? Why cannot I mingle in the busy current of activity, and fish pearls from it as others do? O thou thrice-cursed health! But fair and softly! I will take thee in flank, if I cannot in front.</p>
<p>During my half-weeks repose I was busily meditating some scheme of a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunstwerk</hi></foreign> [work of art] of my own! There are pictures and thoughts and feelings in me, which <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> come out, tho the Devil himself withstood it! For this time, it was Larry<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The horse at Hoddam Hill.</note> not the Devil. That ungrateful untoward nag has used me like a knave. He had taken cold and staid unmolested in his shop for three days; on the fourth I took him out to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> round by <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Smithy and Hoddam Kirk; I was thinking of you and my <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunstwerk</hi></foreign>, when I met a carrier&#x2019;s cart, and my cursed beast, knowing that I was studying and had nothing but a snaffle bridle, got the bit in his teeth, whirled round at full gallop down a steep place, and had my fair person dislodged from his back and trailed some yards upon the base highway in the twinkling of an eye! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Proh pudor</hi></foreign> [Disgraceful]! I was stunned and scratched and thoroughly bemired: I have scarcely got quit of my headache, and the tailor is mending my coat even now. Larry&#x2019;s friendship and mine is at an end! I have got a fierce iron curb for him, and I mount him daily with an oak cudgel, and batter his carcase and gallop him into complete tameness. What a termination for my <hi rend="italic">novel</hi>! But the time will come, must come!</p>
<p>Jack is going to Edinburgh, he says, on Tuesday week; he will write to you, and see you if you desire it: he sends his kindest regards to you. Poor Jack! I shall be lonely in winter without him, tho&#x2019; his logic has often galled me while he was here. You must write to my Mother, according to your promise: she loves you truly, as do they all. That poor girl in the cottage at the foot of the Tower is departed at last. <pb id="pg-03-408" n="03:408"/>The other day I was walking at the foot of the hill; and saw among rain and stormy vapour her hearse and humble convoy setting out for the churchyard, and her poor old widowed Mother was standing looking after it beneath the waving leafless tree at the corner of her hut. I could have wept burning tears. Sharpe<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >General Matthew Sharpe, his landlord.</note> was hunting on the other side of the glen with a young new-married wife. <foreign><hi rend="italic">So geht die Welt</hi></foreign> [So goes the world].</p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>I have received your answer to my Son&#x2019;s note;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neither note nor answer has been found.</note> which note, I may be allowed to say, was written not of his own motion, but at the suggestion of Mr Blackadder, and in consequence of his <hi rend="italic">denying</hi> that you had promised in his presence to let us have the Farm on any terms, and which expressed our happiness at your agreeing not with <hi rend="italic">us</hi> but <pb id="pg-03-409" n="03:409"/>with <hi rend="italic">him</hi> in thinking some farther arrangement necessary. To your two distinct questions<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Written below the word <hi rend="italic">requisitions</hi>, neither of which had been crossed through.</note> I shall now endeavour to make answer as distinctly.</p>
<p>1. Of the First Statement I am sorry to say that any avowal I can make must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be altogether unqualified. I learned that the Hill Farm was to be let, and did not think myself called on to inquire by what means it had come into the market, so it was there. On applying to you for it, I was told that it had been offerred to another person; and that if he refused it, I might have it.</p>
<p>2. Of the Second Statement I am sorry that my avowal can still less be unqualified. On the contrary I am ready to affirm on oath that till within three weeks of Whitsunday, I never heard from any man any notice or hint which conveyed to my mind the most distant suspicion that Mr Blackadder&#x2019;s claims<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >These claims were &#xa3;150 due him for the work and matters mentioned below. Sharpe thought it the Carlyles&#x2019; obligation; James Carlyle obviously thought otherwise.</note> were at all different from those universally existing between outgoing and incoming tenant: nor have I forgot that on your mentioning Two Arbiters and my proposing Mr Hunter as alone sufficient, it was stated <hi rend="italic">in so many words</hi> that the claims to be settled were &#x201C;the ploughing, the lime-heaps, and the manure in the farm-yard&#x201D;; claims to which Mr Hunter&#x2019;s single judgement seemed perfectly adequate.</p>
<p>It would appear, then, that this Bargain has from the first been grounded on misconceptions. As it does not consist with your determination to make any new arrangement, or any farther effort for unravelling the perplexity; and as I have reluctantly determined not again to attempt unravelling it by settlement with Mr Blackadder, having by repeated and very unpleasant experiences convinced myself that this is a task beyond the utmost compass of my ability,&#x2014;nothing will remain but that the misunderstood Transaction be <hi rend="italic">un</hi>transacted by the quickest and quietest method in our power. If you will have the goodness to signify to me in writing that I am at liberty on payment of my stipulated rent to quit these premises at Whitsunday, on the usual principles of an outgoing tenant, I shall readily engage to do so, and the business will be terminated and the discussion of it complete.</p>
<closer><salute>With much respect, I have the honour to be, / Sir, / Your most obed<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Serv<hi rend="italic">t</hi> /</salute></closer>

<p>In the busy idleness<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

Indeed the more I am in the way of what is commonly called pleasure, the more I think of the calm days which I spent under your roof&#x2014; I have never been so happy since&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I have been at several fine entertainments where much thought and pains and money were expended to assemble the ingredients of enjoyment. And this is nowise strange since <hi rend="italic">affection</hi> is the native element of my soul, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I found in your cottage, warm and pure, while in more splendid habitations it is for the most part chilled with vanity, affectation and selfishness&#x2014; For <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;There is nothing but a mixture of good and evil in the world Mother&#x201D;</hi> and thus some have the &#x201C;dinner of herbs where love is,&#x201D; others the &#x201C;stalled ox and hatred therewith.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>I left Templand on Thursday last, after many delays; but in no such downcast mood as at my departure from the Hill. Indeed I was never in my life more pleased to turn my face homeward, where if I have not suitable society any more than in Nithsdale, I can at least enjoy more freely that which is next best&#x2014;solitude. But all my impatience to see Haddington failed to make the journey hither agreeable, which was as devoid of <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Christian comfort&#x201D;</hi> as any thing you can suppose&#x2014; Never was poor damsel reduced to such <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;extremities of Fate&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014;I was sick&#x2014;woefully sick&#x2014;and, notwithstanding that I had on four petticoats, benumbed with cold; to make my wretchedness as complete as possible, we did not reach Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> till many hours after dark&#x2014;Sixteen miles more, and my wanderings for this season are at an end! <pb id="pg-03-411" n="03:411"/>Would that my trials were ended also! But no! Tell Mr Carlyle my handsome Cousin is coming to Haddington with his sister Ph&#x9c;be, and his valet Henley and his great dog Toby, over and above Dash, Craigen, Fanny and Frisk&#x2014; My heart misgives me at the prospect of this inundation of company; for their ways are not my ways,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 55:8.</note> and &#x201C;what is amusement to them is death to me&#x201D;&#x2014; But I must just be patient, as usual&#x2014;patient! Verily I should need to <supplied>[be]</supplied> Job instead of Jane Welsh to bear these everlasting annoyances with any degree of composure. Mr Carlyle must write next week, without fail&#x2014;to Haddington, lest in vexation of spirit I curse God and die&#x2014;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

Fritz, his last, a present from Lady Ashburton, carried him safely for many years through the London streets, to the astonishment of most of his friends. I asked him once how he had escaped misadventure. &#x2018;It was Fritz,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;He was a very sensible fellow. I suppose he had not been brought up to think that the first duty of a horse was to say something witty&#x2019;&#x201D; (Froude&#x2019;s note).</note> if he would not have me live in continual terror for his life. If the Fates are kind and our good Doctor a man of his word he will be in this city tomorrow so that I have some hope to feast my eyes on the broad Atlantic of his countenance and hear all about my dear friends at the Hill before I go&#x2014; How does Jane&#x2019;s Latin prosper&#x2014;tell her to write me a postscript in her Brother&#x2019;s next letter&#x2014;my kindest regards to my Friend and all the rest&#x2014; You must excuse this hurried epistle&#x2014;I am writing under many eyes and in the noise of many tongues&#x2014; <closer><salute>God bless you<supplied>[.]</supplied> I am always affectionately yours</salute></closer></p>

There are snatches of what I called <hi rend="italic">Coterie-Speech</hi> in this Letter; two quite of new date, bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> from Hoddam Hill, which I must explain.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Broad Atlantic of his countenance&#x2019; was a phrase I had noticed in some stupidly adoring <hi rend="italic">Life of Fox</hi>, and been in use to apply to my Br<hi rend="italic">r</hi> John,&#x2014;whose face also was <hi rend="italic">broad</hi> enough (and full of honesty and good hum<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, poor fellow!)&#x2014;he is now, as will be seen, daily expected in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, to the <hi rend="italic">Medical Classes</hi>. From him also comes the other phrase, &#x2018;mixture of good and evil&#x2019;:&#x2014;he was wont in his babbly way, while at breakfast with Mother and me, to remark, when the least thing was complained of or went wrong, &#x201C;Nothing but evil in the world, Mother!&#x201D; Till one day, &#x201C;Mother&#x201D; took him sharply up on theological grounds;&#x2014; ever onwards from wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he used to make it, &#x2018;Nothing but <hi rend="italic">a mixture of good and</hi> evil&#x2019; &#x26;c! He had many mock-utterances of this kind: &#x201C;Comes all to the same ultimately&#x201D;; &#x201C;What d&#x2019;ye think of Life, this morning?&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c &#x26;c; over wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> we had our laughing &#x26; counter-mocking; <hi rend="italic">borne</hi> with perfect gravity always, and perfect patience; but producing no abate<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of the practice.

<salute>My &#x201C;affectionate Child&#x201D;</salute>
<p>It grieved me to learn from your good little postscript, that the poor Latin was already come to a stand: for I would fain see the talents, wherewith Nature has intrusted you, not buried in ignorance, but made the most of. Nevertheless I do not <hi rend="italic">blame</hi> you, because you have despaired of accomplishing an impossibility; for it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> impossible for you, sure enough, to make any great attainment of scholarship, &#x201C;in the circumstance you are at present placed in.&#x201D;</p>
<p>You must on no account, however, abandon the idea of becoming a scholar, for good, because it is beyond your ability to carry it into effect just as soon as you wish: for your circumstances, by the blessing of Heaven, may in process of time be rendered more toward; but should the noble desire of knowledge die away within you, you would, indeed, cruelly &#x201C;disappoint my hopes&#x201D;&#x2014; Moreover, tho&#x2019; the acquirement of a foreign language has proved too difficult a matter for you, in the time being, I see nothing that there is to hinder you from reading many instructive books on your own. For your Mother <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be <pb id="pg-03-414" n="03:414"/>so hard a Task-mistress that she would refuse you two hours or so in the day to yourself, provided she saw that they were turned to a profitable account.</p>
<p>Here is a copy of Cowper&#x2019;s poems for you with which, I expect, you will presently commence a regular course of reading; your Brother is able, and, I am sure, will be most willing to direct you in the choice of books; and on this account you ought to be exceedingly thankful, as many, for want of such direction have to seek knowledge by a weary circuit.</p>
<p>Had Providence been less kind to you in the relations you hold in life, you should get many an epistle from me full of the best advices I have to give. For I love you, my good little girl, from the bottom of my heart, and desire earnestly that it should be well with you, in this world, as well as in the world to come. But when I consider the piety and goodness of the Mother who has you n<supplied>[ear]</supplied> her bosom; and that He, whose wisdom I bow myself before, is your Brother; I feel it idle and presumptious in me to offer you any counsel; when, in the precepts and example of those about you, you have already such light to your path.</p>
<p>Do but continue, my dear Jane, a dutiful Daughter, and a loving Sister, and you are sure to grow up an estimable <supplied>[w]</supplied>oman. If we can make you also an accomplished woman, so much the better.</p>
<p>One thing more, when I am about it. Look sharp that you fulfil the written promise which you gave me at parting; for, know, that I am not disposed to remit you the smallest tittle of it. <closer><salute>And now God bless you and keep you&#x2014;I am always your attached Friend</salute></closer></p>

<p>This &#x2018;Jane Carlyle&#x2019; is my second-youngest Sister; then a little Child of 12. The youngest Sister, youngest of us all, was <hi rend="italic">Jenny</hi> (Janet); now &#x201C;Mrs Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Hanning,&#x201D; in Hamilton, Canada West. These little beings, bits of <supplied>[brightness in]</supplied> their grey-speckled (black and white) strawbonnets, I recollect as a pair of neat brisk items <hi rend="italic">tripping</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> among us, that summer at The Hill,&#x2014;especially <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi> (only by euphemism, &#x201C;Jane&#x201D;) the biggest of the two, who was a constant quantity there. The small Jenny, I think, on some pet, had unexpectedly flung herself off, and mostly preferred native independence at Mainhill. Jean, from her black eyes and hair, had got the name of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Craw</hi> Jean&#x201D; among us, or often of &#x201C;Craw&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Crow</hi>) simply;&#x2014;that was my Mother&#x2019;s complex<hi rend="italic">n</hi> <pb id="pg-03-415" n="03:415"/>too; but the other seven of us, like our Father, were all of common blond. Jean was an uncommonly open-minded, gifted, ingenuous and ingenious little thing; <hi rend="italic">true</hi> as steel &#x201C;(never told a fib, from her birth upwards)&#x201D;; had once or so shown suddenly a <hi rend="italic">will</hi> like steel, too (when <hi rend="italic">in</hi>disputably in the right,&#x2014;as I have heard her Mother own to me); otherwise a most loving cheerful amenable creature, with a hungering &#x26; thirsting for all kinds of knowledge, had a lively sense of the ridiculous withal,&#x2014;and already something of what you might call &#x201C;humour,&#x201D; poor little Craw! She was, by this time, in visible fav<hi rend="italic">r</hi> with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> doubtless she valued suffic<hi rend="italic">tly</hi>! One of the first things I had noted of her was, five or six years ago, in one of my rusticat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> at Mainhill, when in the summer Ev<hi rend="italic">gs</hi>, Brothers Alick, John &#x26; I used to go out wandering, extensively, and talking d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> over the fields, till gloaming settled into dark:&#x2014;always I observed <supplied>[little <hi rend="italic">Craw</hi>]</supplied> turned up, either at our starting, or somewhere aft<hi rend="italic">ds</hi>, trotting at my side, head hardly higher than my knee, but eagerly thrown back, and listening with zeal and joy,&#x2014;no kind of &#x201C;sport&#x201D; equal to this for her. &#x201C;Pursuit of knowledge under difficulties,&#x201D; poor little Craw!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My Darling took warmly to her, for my sake and the Child&#x2019;s own; this was the first time they had met. &#x201C;Such a Child ought to be educated!&#x201D; said she with generous emphasis, and felt steadily; and indeed took herself for some years onw<hi rend="italic">ds</hi> a great deal of trouble and practical pains ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it,&#x2014;as this <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> may still indicate. Little Jean was had to Comley Bank for a good few months, got her lessons &#x26;c; attended us to Craigenp<hi rend="italic">k</hi>, hoping to try farther there too; but in the chaos of <hi rend="italic">incipience</hi> there (a rather dark and even dismal &#x201C;Chaos,&#x201D; had not <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Jane been a Daughter <hi rend="italic">of the Sun</hi>! [<hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> underscored twice]), this was found impracticable, &#x26; Scotsbrig (Father&#x2019;s place) coveting and almost grudging the <hi rend="italic">little</hi> Jean&#x2019;s bit of lab<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, within doors &#x26; with<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, she had to give the project up, and return to her old way of life; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she loyally did. Grew up a Peasant Girl; got no farther special &#x201C;educat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x201D;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; she has since given herself, consciously and otherwise, not a little both of the practical and of the &#x201C;speculative<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> sort: and is, at this day, to be named fairly a superior woman; or superior in extent of reading, culture &#x26;c, and still better, in veracity of char<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, sound discern<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, and practical wisdom. Wife, for above 35 years now, of James Aitken, a prosperous, altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> honest valiant, intellig<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x26; substant<hi rend="italic">l</hi> man, House-painter in Dumfries by trade;&#x2014; Parents they too of my bright little Niece &#x201C;Mary C. Aitken,&#x201D; who <hi rend="italic">copies</hi> for me, and helps all she can, in this my final Operat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in the world.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Your kind command was duly communicated to me, and I calculated on obeying it last thursday, and this having failed, on every one of the subsequent days. But a fit of diligence has seized me of late weeks; and as I imagined you yourself would have disapproved of my neglecting my appointed task for such a purpose, I forebore writing in the morning, and every evening some perverse occurence or another came athwart my measures to prevent it then also. You must forgive this delay, like a good girl as you always are, and believe that tho&#x2019; silent towards you, I am neither day nor night forgetful of you, nor <pb id="pg-03-417" n="03:417"/>shall ever be by God&#x2019;s blessing, while I continue in this sojourn of the living and the loving. My Mother has already scolded me sufficiently for my omission: she figures you to be of the same imaginative disposition as herself, and would not have you for a moment exposed to the assaults of that afflicting faculty. You have not done as Job&#x2019;s wife counselled Job, notwithstanding your threat?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To &#x201C;curse God and die&#x201D; (Job 2:9).</note> No, you are alive still, and love me, and hope to see good things with me in this world after all! If you were to die, either blessing God or any other way, what should I do, think you? Where would the living heart remain that I could long to incorporate with my own, the spirit in whose presence some faint dawn of true existence still visited my bewildered eyes? O my Dearest! Surely I am an ungrateful man to murmur at Fate, and forget that it has given me thee! I know, I feel, when the malignant demon leaves me for a moment, that peace from all my woes awaits me in thy arms; that with thee the world shall again become for me a green hospitable field, and the gloomy spectres of imagination fly away before the bright warm sunshine of reality. Why do I forget this, and live without faith in the world? O that faith were changed into Light, that believing had become enjoying! Love me truly, and all will yet be well.</p>
<p>Your letter to my Mother had been anxiously expected, and was gladly and gratefully received. Had she the pen of the ready writer, she would have sent you a reply of a grander texture than any you have ever got from Bedford-square<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Home of Mrs. Montagu.</note> itself: but alas, she has scarcely any pen at all, and must live for the present &#x201C;with a most voiceless thought.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Identified by A. Carlyle as from Byron&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold</hi>, III, 97: &#x201C;But as it is, I live and die unheard, / With a most voiceless thought, sheathing it like a sword.&#x201D;</note> She bids me give you her kindest love; she &#x201C;has a hundred things to say, but&#x201D; unhappily &#x201C;cannot put any of them into language.&#x201D; Jane would have written you a postscript, I doubt not; for she has read and re-read your letter; but to-day she is at Mainhill, and the wild sleety weather leaves no chance of her returning in time.</p>
<p>I regret heartily this irruption of puppyism, quadruped and biped, with which you are threatened and perhaps even now visited.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The visit of Jane&#x2019;s handsome cousin, Captain James Baillie and, as she had written to Carlyle&#x2019;s mother on <date when="1825-11-14">14 Nov.</date>, &#x201C;his sister Phoebe, and his valet Henley, and his great dog Toby, and over and above Dash, Craigen, Fanny and Frisk.&#x201D; Capt. James Baillie is among those whom Carlyle has in mind as he deals satirically with Dandyism in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> and other later works.</note> It is deplorable to have one&#x2019;s heart vexed, and one&#x2019;s thoughts and occupations <pb id="pg-03-418" n="03:418"/>put to flight by that inane hubbub: yet what can be done or attempted for deliverance? Perhaps, caring less about it! Conceive that you have neither part nor lot in the affair, that your whole duty in it is to keep its influences excluded from your heart and head, and to live as if it were not there. Why should you fret yourself? Your business for the present is to keep yourself peaceful and still, in the prospect of more active and worthy days: if you can be contented and amused, by any harmless means, it is all that your present situation can be called on to do for you. By taking thought you cannot alter one thread in the tissue of your fate: it is I that must labour for myself and you, to prepare a scene for us to labour in together. Think of this, and let your gay Lancer with his pugs and poneys take his swing before you, as you would a cunning artist that was come to eat fire and emit ribbands for your pastime. The Captain must be better entertainment than is common about Haddington; and it is right that you be entertained with him. Besides consider, that he is a kindly soul with all his frivolousness, and really loves you, perhaps is in love with you; a quality which covereth a multitude of sins.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Charity shall cover the multitude of sins&#x201D; (1 Pet. 4:8).</note> What if you should try a slight flirtation with him, by way of driving on the time? Perhaps, you had better not, however. There is no use in jesting with edge tools; and if he ran away with you, I should be obliged to follow him and pull his dyed whiskers&#x2014;unless indeed it were with your own free mind and cooperation, in which case, I suppose, there would be nothing for it, but to curse with sufficient emphasis the whole generation of <foreign><hi rend="italic">inexprimables</hi></foreign> [&#x201C;inexpressibles&#x201D; or &#x201C;breeches&#x201D;], and set my house in order, and go and hang myself. A baleful consummation either way!</p>
<p>For the last three weeks I have been the most industrious man in Annandale. It would do you good to see with what steadfastness I equip myself every morning with dreadnought and wooden shoes and sally forth to walk to the Kelhead toll-bar, regardless of the fury of the elements; then return to breakfast and translate; to mingle in fit proportions throughout the day the exercises of the body and the mind, till late night finds me a sheet farther forward in my compilation. I am not happy, but neither am I miserable, and my work advances without injury to my health. Ere long I suppose I shall be in Edinburgh arranging the printing. I have written to Tait<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1825-11-23">23 Nov.</date> William Tait had written to Carlyle from Edinburgh: &#x201C;I am greatly disappointed by your account of the small progress you have made; having expected to see you before this time with your MS quite ready for press. But I am aware that authors, like you, who have no notion of doing anything but in the best style, must not be hurried. The book will be the better of the care you are taking in the selection of your materials. Indeed, I expect that it will add exceedingly to the fame you have already acquired; which is not small in this quarter, I assure you.<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;Not one of the books you want are in the Advocates&#x2019; Library. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving sends his respects to you.<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;I am much at a loss what to do for books for you. To Gillies I cannot apply. Sir W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Hamilton may have some of the books required, and I think would lend them to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>; but would scarcely lend them to us to be lent to another person. Very few of them are in Black&#x2019;s (<hi rend="italic">London</hi>) Catalogue. Fleischer is out of the question.<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;Those you order us to buy for you shall be procured immediately from Black (London) if he has them, and two or three more. But Black often puts Books into his Catalogue which he cannot supply till he gets them them [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] from Germany<supplied>[.]</supplied><lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;Ballantyne is to print your book in his very best way, with new types, English Paper, and every thing in the first style.<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;As soon as I can find a parcel of books for you, I shall dispatch them by your Brother&#x2019;s means.&#x201D;</note> for more books, <pb id="pg-03-419" n="03:419"/>which I expect in a day or two; and I am already done with Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen</hi>, and Mus&#xE4;us&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">Stumme Liebe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Libussa</hi>. The former was meant for you, but for want of other work, I took it up myself. I have still his <hi rend="italic">Melechsala</hi> before me, and then I bid him <foreign>adieu</foreign> with small regret. He is a man of fine talent, but has no genius whatever. One volume of the publication I purpose to occupy with <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</hi>, Goethe&#x2019;s last work, instead of <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi>, which I once had thoughts of but cannot now abide. There is also one <hi rend="italic">Maler M&#xfc;ller</hi> (The <hi rend="italic">Painter</hi> M&#xfc;ller) of whom I hear a most flattering report, tho&#x2019; he is entirely unknown in this country; from him I calculate on gathering another half volume. On the whole I begin to be better satisfied with the aspect of this business; and at all events eager to get it off my hands. I should not be surprised tho&#x2019; you saw me in a few weeks! You shall take me in your arms and kiss me ten times over then! You must of your own accord!</p>
<p>May Heaven pity me and you with this accursed pen and paper! Alick brought the letter up from Annan, and tho&#x2019; my life were lying on it, the ink will not look at it! I see not how you will ever get it road. But that is your concern! Jack writes that he saw you on the morning before you went to Haddington. He says you were very kind to him; but tho&#x2019; you did not complain to him, he thinks your health is not so good as it was in summer, and I must write to you not to study. This piece of news threw a damp over me at first, which I have now, I know not on what grounds, contrived to put aside. O my Darling, the bare idea of miseries that <hi rend="italic">might</hi> too easily occur fills my whole <pb id="pg-03-420" n="03:420"/>soul with darkness! Never till I had lost thee should I know how deep and abiding was thy dwelling in my heart. But it must not and shall not be. O for your love of me, take thought of these things! Be careful, sedulous scrupulous about your safety; for it is mine too. Do you walk daily? Every day? There is no drug or doctoring in the whole Pharmacopeia that is worthy a pin but this. Promise me that you will observe it, tell me that you are well, and I shall be at ease. I shall ride to Ecclefechan on the back of Larrey with this to-night. Fear not for the ungracious beast; with marting<supplied>[a]</supplied>le and curb and spurs he is quiet as <hi rend="italic">Garron</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Small, sturdy breed of horse mainly used for rough hill work.</note> <hi rend="italic">Bawn</hi>, and could not hurt me tho&#x2019; he were Bucephalus<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Excellent but fiery-tempered horse which could not be tamed except by its master, Alexander the Great.</note> himself. He is condemned for sale at the first Dumfries fair; and I very seldom ride even now.&#x2014; I am lonely for the want of poor Jack, tho&#x2019; his logic afflicted me while he was here; yet I am fast getting used to solitude. Alick and my Mother read beside me at night: for the last two nights she has been busy with the Life of Mr John and Mr Josiah your ancestors from the &#x201C;Scots worthies.&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John and Josiah Welsh. For a long time the Carlyles believed that Jane was descended from John Knox, but A. Carlyle says that she was not descended from the John Welsh who married a daughter of Knox, as she had thought, but from John&#x2019;s elder brother, David Welsh of Colliston, and he cites the <hi rend="italic">Life of John Welsh</hi> by James Young (Edinburgh, <date when="1866">1866</date>).</note> I objected somewhat to her apotheosis of these noble-minded persons: but she answered: &#x201C;say nae ill o&#x2019; thy ain!&#x201D;&#x2014; You will write directly? <closer><salute>Yours <foreign><hi rend="italic">auf ewig</hi></foreign></salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I grieve to think of the weary waiting which you must have commenced six and thirty hours ago, and must at all events continue for other six and thirty to no purpose. The fault lies not with us: your parcel has not been above twenty minutes in my hand at this present date! I had Larry saddled on Sunday morning, and set out for Annan; my Father, who was here that day and belated for Church, with our Mother and the rest waiting anxiously for my return with farther news from you. The adepose Doctor was not to be met with or heard of: <pb id="pg-03-421" n="03:421"/>but I found the sturdy Gavin with his chin new-mown leaning on a house corner meditatively; and he assured me that he had no parcel either for me or Dr Waugh, none absolutely on his word of verity! The false treacherous Turk! Alick went down again today, to get his watch and sell oats; and it then appeared that Waugh <hi rend="italic">had</hi> got a parcel from you, but not till yesterday about noon! From all which it results: 1&#xB0; that Carriers are a portion, on the wrong side, of that <hi rend="italic">Mixture</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John&#x2019;s &#x201C;mixture of good and evil.&#x201D;</note> which our &#x201C;Mother&#x201D; well knows to be the material of all Earthly things; 2&#xB0; that I must write to you instantaneously to counterwork their influence as far as possible; 3&#xB0; that I must ride to Ecclefechan by sunrise tomorrow morning (if the sun rise at all, which from the present sleet and howling storm seems dubious) or my writing will not reach you till Monday.</p>
<p>We waited long and anxiously for your first letter;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1825-11-21">21 Nov.</date> John had written: &#x201C;I saw Thomas Murray yesterday but he would talk about nothing but his Tour thro&#x2019; the Highlands, and his breakfasting that day and dining the day before with Hume the Whig M. P. who is a perfect town-speech here at present. He has got another pupil a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Smith on the same terms as Mayberly who is still with him. I met the illustrious Cron to-day in the library. He seems in rather good spirits and has been much better since he received your letter. Mitchell I have not seen.&#x2014;&#x2014; You may have heard that Lockhart is appointed Editor of the Quarterly Review with a salary of 1500&#xa3; per an. Jeffrey is the author of the review of Meister. A young man of the name of Macauly, Murray says, wrote the article on &#x2018;Milton.&#x2019; Macauly it seems is a favourite or proteg&#xE9; of Brougham.&#x201D; In another letter merely dated &#x201C;Wednesday&#x201D; [<date when="1825-11-26">26 Nov.</date>?] John wrote: &#x201C;Miss Welsh has her remembrances to Jane, and bids me say it is not proper she thinks to give up the Latin so ignobly.&#x201D;</note> and heartily condoled with you on the sorry cheer which your journey afforded. My own experience of these things teaches me how heavily they fall upon a wearied and dispirited wight, whose heart is sore enough at parting from his quiet moorings, without the aid of physical and other pettifogging distresses to increase his grief. I hope by this time it is pretty well forgotten; that you are settling to your tasks, and getting free of that dreary home-sickness which never fails to torment one for the first week after one&#x2019;s again venturing among strangers. You say nothing of your lodgings: do you find them answer? Our kind anxious mother has been <hi rend="italic">harping</hi> frequently about a cold you had at your departure; I have assured her &#x201C;on the best grounds,&#x201D; that it must be gone long ago: yet tell us so, if you can, next time you write.</p>
<p>For some days after you left me I felt quite <hi rend="italic">harried</hi> and disconsolate; a dreary loneliness took possession of me go where I would. Time and diligence in business have now somewhat reconciled me; and I <pb id="pg-03-422" n="03:422"/>look upon your absence with a mild regret, and the hope of soon meeting you again. These separations tho&#x2019; painful are not useless: they teach us to prize duly what the daily presence of makes trivial in our eyes; if we had our friends always we should never know how much we loved them. Continue to trust me, my good Jack, as of old; for tho&#x2019; distempers and the most despicable distresses make me choleric and frequently unreasonable, I love you truly, and have no dearer wish than to see you prospering beside me. I lament to think that my power of aiding you should be so limited; but to the utmost extent of my ability you need not be invited to command me. Between us, we shall manage it! Of this allow yourself no doubt. It was pity among other things that you went away so ill supplied with cash; I know it makes one sad in hours of hypochondria to have so little in the strongbox; but if this stock should verge to decline before my coming, as in all probability it will, write for more with <hi rend="italic">yen impident face</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An impudent face: boldly.</note> and it shall not fail to be sent.</p>
<p>Of our proceedings here since your departure the history may soon be told. Conceive the three most quiescent weeks of your experience in Hoddam Hill, and write <hi rend="italic">ditto ditto</hi> as the account of these. At my return from convoying you, I found Mrs Irving and Gavin<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gavin Johnston.</note> of Bogside waiting here; they had come to take farewell of you, and missed their purpose by a few minutes. Since that night we have had no visitor, or event worth notice even here. Alick feeds his stall-cattle and pokes about doing odd jobs throughout the day, and at night comes and reads beside me. My Mother and I have our private cup of tea as usual: she spins and fights about; Jenny and the new maid are here (a strapping grimy mettlesome quean); and Jane is absent at Mainhill. Jenny was brought over by our Mother for her health; for she was getting <foreign><hi rend="italic">billus</hi></foreign> at Mainhill. She now seems to be quite well; and all the rest of us are if anywise changed since you saw us, changed to the better.</p>
<p>For myself I have gone along with exemplary industry for several weeks; translating daily my appointed task; walking and smoking at intervals, and turning neither to the right hand nor the left, as if I were a scribbling smoking sleeping and dyspeptical automaton. I am thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">Mute Love</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Libussa</hi> in Mus&#xE4;us: yesterday morning I began <hi rend="italic">Melechsala</hi>, which will conclude my doings with that scornful gentleman; unless I think of adding the <hi rend="italic">Treasure-digger</hi> to my list, a contingency <pb id="pg-03-423" n="03:423"/>depending somewhat on the operations of Messrs Tait and their consigners. My health is better rather than worse, tho&#x2019; I ride very little, having substituted walking in its stead; unless for journeys that render it worth while to button on the mudboots, an enterprise of some pith and moment. I go every morning to the neighbourhood of the Clayhouses Tollbar or some such distance; take another stroll before dinner; perhaps a third after it, and by supper time, my task has insensibly come to a conclusion.</p>
<p>As to the period of my coming to Edinburgh, I can still say nothing definite. I would fain have these books in my hands before starting with the Printers; and Tait writes shilly-shally-wise about their coming; so that I can scarcely understand what to make of it. I wish you would ask him what books he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> sent for to London, that I may know what to expect in the best possible view of the case. Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> I believe I could borrow: a few pounds of money will procure all the rest. When I have done with <hi rend="italic">Mus&#xE4;us</hi>, I shall most probably begin <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi>; and after that I shall be <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to come northward without further calculation. That may perhaps be in about a month. I am loth, I confess, to set my head into the <foreign><hi rend="italic">reeky</hi></foreign> den again; being comparatively well here, and having little hope of being so there. Yet what must be must be; and after all, it is better that it should be so. We must arrange our lodgings somehow so that we be in a house: you can be inquiring in the interim.</p>
<p>I had almost forgot your question about the farm. There is still no ray of light thrown upon it, and no step taken in it. Today Alick spoke to Farish of Annan (Blackadder&#x2019;s successor), who informed him that &#x201C;the General&#x201D; had been speaking with him on the subject, but had not then determined what to do, &#x201C;whether to let the place again, or keep it in his own hand&#x201D;; however he would see him again before next Thursday, and then be able to say more. Thus it stands: it would not surprise me, tho&#x2019; we staid here after all. Blessed are they that are <foreign><hi rend="italic">in utrumque parati</hi></foreign> [prepared for either event]!</p>
<p>I have filled your sheet, and much yet remains to be said. You will write almost immediately, or rather altogether so; for we have yet heard no deliberate account of you; neither can this be called a deliberate account of us, considering my hurry (I finished my task before beginning) and the quality of my materials physical as well as intellectual. This is Alick&#x2019;s paper, brought from Annan: I rather think I shall never write another letter on it.&#x2014; Tell me all that you are doing and feeling, what heart you are in, how your time is divided, and all things <pb id="pg-03-424" n="03:424"/>else that can be inquired about you. Think that you write to a Brother, and to friends who <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> feel indifferent to you. Is your <hi rend="italic">thesis</hi> fixed upon, and any steps whatever taken in it? What classes are you attending? What company have you? Give my compl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to Mitchell, Murray, Crone, Church, and tell me how they are all getting on. There is an interest other than intrinsic in their history to me. Is Lockhart for certain Editor of the Q.R.? Is he to live in London? Has Dr Brewster published his mineralogy book with Tait? Is Allan Cunningham&#x2019;s nov<hi rend="italic">elle</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably <hi rend="italic">Paul Jones</hi>, which did not appear until <date when="1826">1826</date>. In <date when="1825">1825</date> Cunningham published <hi rend="italic">Songs of Scotland</hi> in four volumes. Brewster published no book on mineralogy at this time but some papers on the subject which Carlyle may have had in mind.</note> out yet?&#x2014; My Mother is cowering before the fire, smoking, and sends you her kindest wishes and prayers, and bids me ask if you <hi rend="italic">gang to the Kirk</hi>? The kindest affection of us all is with you. <closer><salute>Good night, my dear Jack, write soon and minutely, and believe me&#x2014;ever thy true Brother,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>I have ordered them to rouse me tomorrow morning for the postoffice unless there be a fall. Tonight it is a hurricane of drift and sleet,&#x2014; as perilous a night as you would wish for. Tomorrow, <foreign><hi rend="italic">nous verrons</hi></foreign> [we shall see].</p></ps>

<p><salute>They are gone, my Dearest! fairly gone!</salute> Mr Baillie, and Miss Phoebe, and all the Dogs, and my Uncle from Galloway, and his Wife, and his Wifes Brother besides. This has been a more terrible infliction than anything that befell our friend Job.

This blessedness is <hi rend="italic">ours</hi>! and yet I am discontented with my lot; because it is not in every particular exactly as I wish it! &#x201C;So little knows any but God alone to value right the good before him!&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, IV, 201&#x2013;3.</note> Surely it is weak, sinful in me ever to get out of humour and vex you with complaints and now that I think of it I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be patient&#x2014;for the next four and twenty hours at least /</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I found your letter lying for me at Ecclefechan, on Monday, in the middle of rain and mist; and gallopped home with it in my pocket, as proud for the time being as if it had been Bish&#x2019;s head prize.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> You are a dear good girl; and shall be happy yet, in spite of Fate itself; for I will clasp you in my arms, and my bosom shall be your home, and instead of pen and ink, your kisses and your bright black eyes shall tell me what is passing in your heart. These hopes <hi rend="italic">are</hi> standing <pb id="pg-03-427" n="03:427"/>for us in the distance; not built on air, the baseless fabric of a vision;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi>, IV, i.</note> but founded on the solid rocks of worldly difficulty, which if we had once surmounted&#x2014;!&#x2014; Pity that the path were so steep, and the distance so long! But step after step will bring one to the end of the Earth: let us never murmur; but step and step, till the toilsome pilgrimage is done, and we are safe in the promised land!</p>
<p>I have been as busy as might be ever since I wrote; and do not mean to stop, except forced to do it, till the business is concluded. I have done with Mus&#xE4;us,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Karl August Mus&#xE4;us (<date when="1735">1735</date>&#x2013;<date when="1887">87</date>), German author of satirical novels and fanciful tales. His <hi rend="italic">Volksm&#xE4;rchen der Deutschen</hi>, 5 vols., appeared in <date when="1782">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1786">86</date>. From this work Carlyle translates and publishes in <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> &#x201C;Dumb Love,&#x201D; &#x201C;Libussa,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Melechsala.&#x201D;</note> having finished <hi rend="italic">Melechsala</hi> last night, and thereby got too much of him rather than too little. At present I am undecided whether to proceed with writing his <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, and set the Printers to work forthwith, or in the first place to translate La Motte Fouqu&#xE9;&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron Friedrich Heinrich Karl de La Motte Fouqu&#xE9; (<date when="1777">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843">1843</date>), German author of the romantic novel <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi> (<date when="1811">1811</date>) and the libretto for Hoffmann&#x2019;s opera <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi> (<date when="1816">1816</date>). Carlyle translates and publishes his tale &#x201C;Aslauga&#x2019;s Knight,&#x201D; like <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi> one of the <hi rend="italic">Jahreszeiten</hi> published in <date when="1814">1814</date>.</note> a task that will not occupy above eight days, but which I am not without a wish to decline altogether, se<supplied>[e]</supplied>ing it has been performed already, tho&#x2019; as I am told very badly. After that, I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> proceed northward; for my books will be exhausted; and no effectual progress will be made in getting more, I fear, till I arrive in person. On computing manuscripts last night, I was surprised to find that <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of my three volumes are almost wholly in black and white; that is the translation part of them. I wish the thing were off my hands, that I might make an effort after some undertaking of more pith and moment. Alas! The matter lies deep and crude, if it lies at all, within my soul; and much unwearied study will be called for, before I can shape it into form. Yet out it shall come, by all the powers of Dulness! And thou my fair Guardian Saint, my kind hot-tempered Angel, my beloved scolding wife, thou shalt help me with it, and rejoice with me in success or comfort me in failure! I do rejoice to hear you talk as you do, and as I always hoped you would, about the vulgar bubble Fame. My experience more and more confirms me in my reprobation of it as a principle of conduct; in myself it never leads to aught but selfish discontent, and distraction of the mind from the true aims of a literary aspirant. &#x201C;Fame!&#x201D; says my old Goethe; &#x201C;as if a man had nothing else to strive for but fame! As if the attainment of harmony in his own <pb id="pg-03-428" n="03:428"/>spirit, and the right employment of his faculties, required to be varnished over by its influences on others before it could be precious to himself!&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a reference to Goethe&#x2019;s essay &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Der Ruhm</hi>.&#x201D;</note> This Goethe is a wise man. These are not his words; but they express his opinion, which I joyed to find so similar to my anticipation. You are right now, and you were wrong then: therefore love me with your whole soul; and if fame come to us, it shall be welcome; if not, we care not for it, having something far more precious than it can either give or take away. O my kind darling! I foresaw that this would be the ultimatum of your heart; but I did not dare to foresee that I should be the man on whom that noble heart would lavish all its treasures. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ob ich sie liebe? Ja, ich liebe sie ganz und ewig!</hi></foreign> [Do I love you? Indeed I love you without reserve and everlastingly!]</p>
<p>But I am getting much too sublime; and a considerable alloy of nonsense always insinuates itself into such speculations, when I rise into the heroic mood. I must change them now for the most unheroic piece of business you can well fancy. I have a task to set you, which perhaps you will not attempt, and which unless your favour for me is great you will frown at me for mentioning this second time. It relates to that farm of <hi rend="italic">Shawbrae</hi>: attend to me a little, and I will tell you how the whole matter stands.</p>
<p>The all-important Major has been here, making arrangements for letting <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Duke&#x2019;s lands, and setting the whole country-side in a ferment. He has seen my Father; is informed of his quarrel with Sharpe, and approves of the principles on which that noble squire has been gainsayed and set at a small price. He has also satisfied himself that in case my Father get a farm from him, it stands a fair chance of good management in all points both as regards itself and its landlord. These preliminaries settled, he has in consequence cheerfully admitted the honest man to offer for this <hi rend="italic">Shawbrae</hi>, which is now open to the market, the former tenant, who occupies only a fraction of the intended space, being quite unfit and disinclined to have any concern with it. So far all is well.</p>
<p>Now the way of managing these things is this. The offers, only from persons of approved sufficiency, are given in; and in case no secondary cause of preference exists the farm is given to the highest offerer forthwith. But if any of them can secure recommendations from private friends or the like, and all are very eager to secure them, then <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Major selects the man whom he delighteth to honour, and tells him: &#x201C;Sir, if you like to give me so and so (naming the highest <pb id="pg-03-429" n="03:429"/>offer he has got or perhaps some fraction more), you shall have the farm; if not, not.&#x201D; This is all the length he goes; but this length, it seems, he does go in every case without exception, where such a circumstance exists.</p>
<p>Hereby you perceive what influence hangs upon your nod in this affair. It strikes me that you could perhaps resolve on writing to your friend, and mentioning the business. To Major Creighton the sacrifice is nothing; for most probably he has never seen or heard of any one of the competitors; and the interest of his patron will rather be promoted than injured by the interference. All you would need to say might be comprised in three lines: That such a one, you understood, was offering for the farm of Shawbrae; and that if Major C. in consistency with his duties could show him any kindness, you would esteem it a favour. This little word might turn the scale: and if it did not, why let the scale remain unturned; we have tried all our means, and can happily continue to exist [one or two words indistinguishable].</p>
<p><supplied>[Now]</supplied>, Jane, my <foreign>bonny</foreign> woman, I have told thee the whole state of the case. It <supplied>[is]</supplied> not without reluctance that I decided on mentioning it again. It has gone thro&#x2019; my head several times; and a gentleman called Pride has been rather busy persuading me to maintain a dead silence on the subject: &#x201C;Hast thou too come to asking favours?&#x201D; he says: &#x201C;Thou! Poor selfish mortal, and to use <hi rend="italic">her</hi> kind affection for these purposes! Go to! Ask favours of God Almighty; but die in the ditch, before asking them of any poor clay-tenant like thyself.&#x201D; These thoughts are agreeable to the natural man: but something better than Pride spake up within me and said: &#x201C;And are these thy feelings towards <hi rend="italic">her</hi>? This stubborn attitude of self-help to her, the partner of thy inmost heart, the true sharer of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> thy cares and joys, who loves thee, whom thou lovest? She shall know this corncern [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of thine; and have the luxury of aiding thee, if she can; for only her ability, not her will is doubtful.&#x201D; I have obeyed this better monitor, nor shall I regret that I have done so. I have told you all: what I have written, I have written.</p>
<p>Now do not vex your good heart about this matter: but consider of it, and decide according to your own judgement, secure that I shall approve of its decision, be what it may. Can I doubt your readiness, if the rules of propriety will let you? And is it more your interest or mine that you should not violate them? I swear to you by the last kiss you gave me that I will love you neither more nor less, do as you may. To me there seems little hindrance; but I feel that I have no light <pb id="pg-03-430" n="03:430"/>whatever. You know my motives and circumstances, and sympathize with me in the wish to make good to these honest-hearted friends the damage they may get by quarrelling with an unjust steward on my account. If this means fail, my life must be short or extremely ineffectual should it offer me no other. Therefore heed not, my own Jane: do what your own sense directs, and count on me for seconding it. One other thing I must add: if you write, let it be <hi rend="italic">directly</hi>. The offers are to <supplied>[be]</supplied> given in next week, and the business will be decided in a very few days&#x2014;after. Now <foreign><hi rend="italic">basta</hi></foreign> [enough]!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a note A. Carlyle says that the farm in question was a part of the Duke of Queensberry&#x2019;s estate, that Jane knew his factor well and complied with Carlyle&#x2019;s request with enthusiasm, but that nothing came of it. A. Carlyle adds that it was lucky that Carlyle&#x2019;s brother Alexander (his own father) did not get this farm.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I have filled all my paper with this prosaic affair; and I had very many savoury speculations, and much tittle-tattle to send, which must now be content to linger for another eight days. Has Jack written to you? He says he had &#x201C;a letter from Miss Welsh, which did his heart good.&#x201D; Write to me <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>, that is the first leisure moment you <supplied>[have]</supplied>.

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Your letter came about eight days ago, to satisfy us touching your welfare, and found us all pretty much as you represent yourself, &#x201C;in <pb id="pg-03-431" n="03:431"/>the old way&#x201D;; each minding his several duties, and struggling on thro&#x2019; this rough pilgrimage of life with the usual proportion of <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Macadam</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Muddy roads and good ones.</note> on our path, and the usual mixture of vapour and sunshine in our sky. It was very mindful in you to write so punctually; the more so as our Mother says that negligence in that social duty is a sin which easily besets you. There is still a kind of <hi rend="italic">vaakum</hi> here in your absence; and many times at night when I lie down to bed, I think that poor Jack is sheltering himself beneath the roof <supplied>[of]</supplied> the stranger: but what can we do? One must follow the ball just where that slippery jade Fortune chuses to trundle it; and even if we could continue in a place, the place itself would crumble away from beneath us, and we should find that take it as we may, we are foreigners and wayfarers in this Earth, and have no continuing city<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18261001-JBW-MW-01">JBW to <sic>Mrs. GW</sic><corr>MW</corr>, <date when="1826-10-01">1 Oct. 1826</date></ref>.</note> within its limits. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach, Du guter Gott, erbarme Dich unser</hi></foreign> [Dear Lord, have mercy upon us]!</p>
<p>I am happy that you have betaken yourself to earnest business, the blessing, disguised as a curse, of sublunary beings; and are diligently meditating to do quickly whatsoever your hand findeth to do. I think this <hi rend="italic">Thesis</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The thesis which John submitted for his degree in medicine was on the subject &#x201C;De Mentis Alienatione&#x201D; [&#x201C;Concerning Mental Diseases&#x201D;].</note> ought to answer well, and profit you both in the composition of it, and perhaps also in the foundation of a character which you may lay with it. No doubt you are thinking of it often: the more maturely the better. And be not discouraged tho&#x2019; at first your pen should be restive, and the sheet remain white after many hours of brainbeating. It is never too good a symptom of a man that he composes easily at first. &#x201C;In a crowded church,&#x201D; says Swift in some such words, &#x201C;the doors get jammed as the audience disperses, and the outcome is slow and irregular; when there is none but the parson and the clerk, they come out rapidly and without disorder.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Swift, &#x201C;Thoughts on Various Subjects,&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">A Proposal for Correcting the English Tongue, Polite Conversations, Etc.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Prose Writings of Jonathan Swift</hi>, ed. Herbert Davis [Oxford, 1957] 4:244).</note> Thus likewise it is with ideas in issuing from the secret dormitories of the mind. &#xc6;neas Rait<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240101-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1824-01-01">1 Jan. 1824</date></ref>.</note> could write a poem sooner than Virgilius Maro<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Publius Vergilius Maro (<date>70&#x2013;19 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), Vergil.</note> did.</p>
<p>Last time I wrote I talked rather distantly about my journey northward: I now find that adventure lying much closer at my door than I expected. <hi rend="italic">Mus&#xE4;us</hi> is done off, three nights ago; and I find myself within a cat&#x2019;s leap of the end of my existing materials. <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi>, which I thought a month&#x2019;s work will scarcely be a week&#x2019;s; and I feel considerable inclination to omit it altogether.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He did omit it.</note> It has been translated, and <pb id="pg-03-432" n="03:432"/>admired by the <hi rend="italic">tea</hi> critics already; and there seems to be another little novel by the same Author in the Advocates&#x2019; Library, which has not been meddled with: if not too long, I should prefer this in some respects. You will be surprised to learn, as I was on calculating, that <hi rend="italic">two</hi> volumes of the Book are already in manuscript, or very nearly two! I have thoughts of writing Mus&#xE4;us Life and sending it off with his tales forthwith to let the Printers have a stroke at it before my arrival: if Johnston or the other Carrier be about setting out next week I really think I may. It was <supplied>[a]</supplied> pity Tait sent for <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>: that was nearly the only book in my list which I had good chance to find in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> by way of loan. But as you say there is very little hope of any thing being done in the business to any good purposes till my own arrival.</p>
<p>Therefore I wish you would investigate the state of things in regard to this, and let me know, as soon as possible. I care not much what sort of rooms we have, so the bed-room were moderately quiet (I do not think I feel quite so skittish on this point as formerly), the vent moderately free from smoke, and the landlady not a slattern. After all you need not vex your heart much about these things; the worse the accommodation is the shorter may be my stay; for with all its drawbacks the country is the place for me at present. I no sooner get below my usual temperature for a single day, than all my miseries rise up from their lurking-places, which I thought their graves, and grin at me with their spectre visages as briskly as ever. But I know my cure: I mount Larry; and set forth upon a ride at the rate of twenty miles an hour, and the hellish squadron vanish into air behind me. Larry rides like a good Christian beast with his new curb; and for speed after being two days in the stable, he absolutely surpasses all quadrupeds I ever bestrode. I incline voting <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to sell him after all.</p>
<p>I must not forget to tell you that I wish you would send down the Birmingham box by Farries, the first time you can get him: I shall need it for carrying out my desk; and the promised <hi rend="italic">Christmas store</hi> of cakes and so forth can come along with me, which will save trouble. I will annoy you with no more messages to Tait: let him <hi rend="italic"><foreign>fecht</foreign> his awn <foreign>bettle</foreign></hi>, till I come out. I shall simply send and buy what books I want, and higgle no more about the matter. Doctor Julius (of Hamburg, whom I saw in spring) <hi rend="italic">has</hi> sent me a letter the other week, written in English, which you shall see, and wonder at. A few more books will serve my turn.</p>
<p>But I must really quit this tittle tattle about myself, before your <pb id="pg-03-433" n="03:433"/>sheet be altogether done. For news here I may tell you that <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Major (Creighton) has been in these parts, kindling wild wishes in the minds of farming men. Our Father is all agog for Shawbrae; has seen this Nithsdale Bashaw of three tails, been kindly received by him, and actually purposes going over the ground tomorrow with &#x201C;his Sons,&#x201D; and making a formal offer for the farm. I have written to Miss Welsh to second this heroic determination; and they all have considerable hopes of prospering. Mrs Irving of Bogside with her Brother &#x201C;Davie of the Hill&#x201D; are about offering for Supplebank, Trams Bob being destined to live elsewhere if at all. Charlie Rae is also to evacuate <hi rend="italic">Gedgills</hi>, for the clay dwellings are to be levelled, and the &#x201C;soot&#x201D; will &#x201C;come in torrents&#x201D; no more. With His Honour things still stand on the former inscrutable footing. After three journeys to Annan, Farish has at length given them his edict on the matter, in the shape of a formal letter <hi rend="italic">giving up</hi> the place, which they are to sign and address to His Honour; after which the Hill farm will again be in the market, and &#x201C;if they like to offer for it afterwards, they may speak to Farish.&#x201D; Alick dreads mischief in the document, and determines not to sign it ti<supplied>[l the]</supplied> Squire sign a counter-document, admitting <hi rend="italic">them</hi> to unfettered egress at Whitsunda<supplied>[y. He and]</supplied> our Father have determined to wait upon His Honour tomorrow morning, and bring the business to an issue. Next time I write I shall thus perhaps be able to tell you something positive about this most pitiful of all the affairs that man&#x2019;s celestial reason was ever troubled with. His Honour I believe has got no good of it himself: Major Creighton had heard of the dispute, and given it at first sight against His Honour.</p>
<p>Yesternight I had a letter from the Targer;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Johnston.</note> brimful of the Haddington School: I wrote him a certificate and sent it off today. There is a contest for the thing; but in all probability the Targer will be preferred. From Miss Welsh&#x2019;s account and his own there seems to be little doubt of this. It is not to be settled till the twenty-fifth of January; before which time the worthy James will have neither eye nor ear for any other object in the universe. No wonder! He has had a battling perverse journey thus far in existence, and longs for some hole of the Earth wherein to lay his head. I sent him an emphatic certificate; and honestly, for there are very few men extant of whom as little can be said in censure. I have not been at Belcathill yet; but I design to go and get the books before I see you. Neither have I been at Ruthwell, much as my conscience has been reproaching me on that score. Indeed <pb id="pg-03-434" n="03:434"/>I am very lazy; far happier at my desk than talking quiddities with idle Christian people; and the weather too has been very unpropitious for travelling; one day slippery as glass, so that riding was breaking of necks; the next rain or Liddisdale mist. One bright Sunday in the slippery season, I went down to Annan; eat two <hi rend="italic">flewks</hi> with Waugh, took tea with Ben Nelson, and <hi rend="italic">tawlked</hi> for the space of three hours: but except this trip I have never been from home farther than to Mainhill, and that only once. What boots it? Like Jamie Halliday, I am an <hi rend="italic"><foreign>unkennt</foreign> Christian</hi> in these parts; and the common places of the natives are &#x201C;very good for Country people.&#x201D; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Andre Zeiten andre Bra&#xfc;che</hi></foreign>: better times are coming for us all. So prophecies the spirit in me, and I do not think it lies.</p>
<p>Have you written to Miss Welsh? If not, do so without loss of time. She says in her last letter, &#x201C;Our beloved Doctor is a letter in my debt, which I am daily expecting him to pay.&#x201D; Did George Irving get the place of Clerk in the Hospital? His sister-in-law passed through these parts lately; is perhaps still in them, for I have not seen her. Do you ever see Murray or Mitchell? Make my compliments to the Immortal: Tom Thomson tells me he has got the promise of a Kirk, at which I feel less surprised than the Immortal himself will do; for he well merits it. Our Mother rejoices that you go to sermon: she often <hi rend="italic">dreams</hi> about you dreams which no one of us can read.&#x2014; Good night, my trusty Jack! I am very wearied, and <hi rend="italic">ravening</hi> for supper. You w<supplied>[ill write]</supplied> without delay? I am ever&#x2014;<closer><salute>Your true Brother</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>[In margins:] <hi rend="italic">Friday Morning</hi>. Our Father is returned from His Honour, but without the slightest shadow of an intelligible deliverance on the matter in debate. His Honour seems very cross, it would appear; and declines having any concern farther with the business: apparently he wishes to be clear himself, and to keep the other party fettered in the noose that he may lead him to and fro to any measure he himself may chuse to fiddle. Let him, if he can! Among domestic events, I might have mentioned the desertion of &#x201C;The Laird,&#x201D; who &#x201C;slanted the Bog&#x201D; monday gone a week:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Laird&#x201D; seems to be some servant who affected laird-like airs&#x2014;refused to work&#x2014;and so earned the nickname. &#x201C;Slant the bog&#x201D; is old James Carlyle&#x2019;s expressive phrase for &#x201C;go away across the fields.&#x201D; See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 9.</note> he felt the task of thrashing for the cattle rather heavy; and Alick found traces of his having foddered some of them with <hi rend="italic">barley</hi>; an expeditious but too expensive method; for which being rebuked, the Laird departed in considerable <pb id="pg-03-435" n="03:435"/>dudgeon. His father says he must send him back; and we partly expect him to-day. Meanwhile Mr Vary<supplied>[?]</supplied> is threshing very diligently; and the presence of the Laird appears to be a thing that can be dispensed with.</p>
<p>I am in a strait for this <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi>; halting between two opinions; I have begun reading it again today, but still cannot fairly make up my mind. I wish I had the <hi rend="italic">Todes-bund</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to Fouqu&#xE9;&#x2019;s short novel <hi rend="italic">Der Todesbund</hi> [<hi rend="italic">The Death Pact</hi>], the first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Kleine Romance</hi> (<date when="1812">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1819">19</date>).</note> from the Advocates&#x2019; Library</p>
<p>I got the stiffener safe. Today is a market at Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and my Father is to carry this thither. Write soon, and tell me about lodgings. What sort of a Landady is your present one? I think I might almost sleep two-in-a-bed for a night or so in case no better might be. Have you heard of Simpson? He was inquiring your address, and got it. I suppose you have not fixed on any newspaper yet? Did you ever see the <hi rend="italic">Edinr Times</hi>? It is only four pence per week, an da paper moderately well spoken of.</p>

<salute>My Dear Johnston,</salute>
<p>I received your letter this evening; and have lost no time in fulfilling the request it contained. I am truly happy to find that your affairs in East Lothian wear so favourable an aspect; from your own account, and other notices which I have had, there seems to be very little doubt of your succeeding in your object. A youn<supplied>[g]</supplied> lady, whom you shall know and like if you go thither, the prime agent in the whole business, writes to me the other day: &#x201C;I am looking forward with much pleasure to having your friend Mr Johnstone, here, that I may hold long communications with him about Annandale. I have got the promise of several votes over and above those secured by Gilbert Burns, so that I have no doubt he will be appointed to the office, tho&#x2019; the townspeople are exerting themselves to the uttermost in favour of a Mr Young.&#x201D; Be of good cheer then! Against the twenty-fifth of January, I shall certainly hail you as <foreign><hi rend="italic">Paedagogus Designatus</hi></foreign> [teacher designate] of that ancient burgh; and then if you <foreign><hi rend="italic">pit frae ye</hi></foreign> [produce] <pb id="pg-03-436" n="03:436"/>any thing in the style you are capable of, I may pronounce you to be a made man.</p>
<p>By all means write for testimonials, from all the four winds; it is the very smallest favour you can ask from Mitchell (because he is now of the High School) from Edward Irving (because his voice is as the trumpet of Orlando Furioso, in the Churches) from Mr Duncan (because as in my case if it do you no good it can do you no ill). There is now distinctly &#x201C;a sound among the mulberry <hi rend="italic">trees</hi> [underscored twice]&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Chron. 14:15.</note> and it behoves you to &#x201C;bestir&#x201D; yourself with all your singular faculties. I never saw you have a fairer chance in my life. This affair will naturally so engross your attention, that till it is concluded I despair of getting you to talk on any other. Therefore I will not tell you a word of my proceedings on the summit of this very storm-beat everlasting Hill; except that I have been very industrious of late weeks, and favoured of Providence so far that almost half of my intended Book is ready for the press, into which I intend to put it forthwith, purposing to set forth for Edinburgh with that view in some three weeks time. I am loth to leave this abode where I have quiet in perfection; free air; the freest of air, and a red nag that carries me with a speed inferior only to that of Mahomet&#x2019;s ass, and has only thrown me <hi rend="italic">once</hi> this whole season. Nevertheless what must be must. Brother John is in &#x201C;Dickson&#x2019;s Lodgings, 13 Hill Place&#x201D;; write to him if you can find as much leisure, or want anything in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> without having leisure. Your friends in Bogside are all well, as are all your friends here: The Duke&#x2019;s farms are to be let immediately; <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Major&#x2019;s appearance has been like that of old Latinus wife in the city of Latium,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amata, who in the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> opposes the coming of the Trojans and the marriage of her daughter Lavinia to one of them.</note> the signal of unutterable hurlyburly and contention over all this district. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Saxa et faces</hi></foreign> [stones and firebrands] (or as Martinus Scriblerus hath it <foreign><hi rend="italic">faeces volant</hi></foreign> [particles of excrement fly]). The Bogside people are about offering for the <hi rend="italic">Bank</hi> (not of England but) the Supplebank; long Robin being doomed and very meritedly doomed to ejection from those premises. My Father means to offer for <hi rend="italic">Shawbrae</hi>. There has yet been no settlement whatever about this place; and poor old Blackadder has paid the debt of nature, and sleeps in Hoddom Churchyard, with all his honesties and villainies along with him. I was <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> to the very heart that day I heard his knell ringing thro&#x2019; the clear frosty air. He was a figure of my memory since light first dawned on it, and now his portly bulk is vanished from my view thro&#x2019; all eternity, and I feel <pb id="pg-03-437" n="03:437"/>again that the fashion of this world passeth away.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Cor. 7:31.</note> It is still uncertain whether Sharpe means that we should stay here after whitsuntide<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Whitsuntide began on <date when="1825-05-26">26 May</date>.</note> or not; but a few days more will determine. He, Sharpe, has acted very <hi rend="italic">like</hi> a knave, if not altogether, as one in this matter, and the imperfect degree of reverence which has been yielded to his attempts at bully-raging and playing the tyrant of his fields may possibly enough have stung his magnanimous heart, I meet him sometimes in my rides, but never without some slight desire to pull his nose. It is the itching of the unregenerate man in me this; I ride on and think Is he not a son of Adam like thyself, with a squint in his eyes, great vanity, a young wife, a touch of villa<supplied>[i]</supplied>ny, and a racked rent roll, and nothing but one small fraction of a brain, to meet these many exigensies? Let him fight his own battle. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu!</foreign></salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dearest&#x2014;</salute>
<p>Your letter found me in bed, at the extremities of fate; but, (oh, miracle of love!) I rose up an hour after, as well as ever I was in my life, and wrote to <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Major<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Major Crichton, factor to the Duke of Queensberry.</note> himself on the subject of your solicitude&#x2014;I have explained to him that in favouring your Father, he would confer the greatest possible obligation on <hi rend="italic">me</hi>: we shall see whether his Majorship thinks it worth while to have a claim upon my gratitude&#x2014;And now let me tell you, Darling, that, instead of frowning at the mention of this affair again, you could not have thought of anything that would have pleased me so much: for it showed the feelings, which you entertain towards me in the very strongest light&#x2014; Of whom in all the world but me would Thomas Carlyle have asked a favour <hi rend="italic">twice</hi>?&#x2014; Thus, you perceive it is best you disregarded the suggestions of that gentleman called Pride (who, I would have you know, is an emissary of the Devil) even altho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">my</hi> interference in the matter should go for nothing&#x2014;</p>
<p>And you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> coming to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>! I am so glad at this arrangement! <pb id="pg-03-438" n="03:438"/>I see not, indeed, any prospect of our <hi rend="italic">meeting</hi> for some time; but it will be comfort to know that you are only sixteen <supplied>[miles]</supplied> off,&#x2014;and then you will send me your manuscripts to read, and a great many little notes, besides <hi rend="italic">the</hi> letter once-a-fortnight. Oh I think I could exist a long while without seeing you, if I got one of these living, breathing letters every&#x2014;hour! As it is, however, I do wish my Mother would give over sulking, and resolve to make the best of what cannot be helped&#x2014; One might think she would do this for her own sake not less than for mine: for she is my <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">must</hi> feel her voluntary exclusion from my dearest interests as painful to herself as it is to me&#x2014; God grant she may take a kinder view of the matter ere long!</p>
<p>Meanwhile I do the best I can under these under these [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] diverse dispensations of Providence&#x2014; I am not well enough at present to study <hi rend="italic">much</hi>, but I read a book of Milton and an article in the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review before I take my walk, and in the evening one of Moliere&#x2019;s plays and a portion of the &#x2018;thirty years war&#x2019;&#x2014; Yesterday I even managed to write <hi rend="italic">two pages</hi> of my life; and (if this weary headach<supplied>[e]</supplied> will let me) I mean to go on writing until I am done with it. I play <hi rend="italic">scotch airs</hi> too! and hem muslin; and walk when it is fair weather&#x2014; The natives, with the exception of the Burnses, I see no more of than cannot be helped; &#x201C;for solitude sometimes is best society&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, IX, 249.</note>&#x2014; And on the whole, tho&#x2019; I am still far from happy, I am considerably less wretched than <supplied>[I]</supplied> have been for many weeks. Perhaps, when I am recovered from this fit of bile,&#x2014;I shall actually learn to live content, &#x201C;which is the calmest life,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, VI, 461.</note> at least, until the season comes round for another campaign on Nithsdale; at the bare idea of which my heart dies within me&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have sent you a small portion of this Manuscript, that you may set your Printers to work on it forthwith, and have all preliminaries settled by the time of my arrival. The introductory matter, I suppose, will require to be printed in a different type from the Translation: but <pb id="pg-03-440" n="03:440"/>of this and all other points relating to the size of the page, and so forth, you and Mr Ballantyne will be much fitter to judge than I; and with you I leave the arrangement of it.</p>
<p>I must come to Town directly, for my books are all done: I should have set out ere now; but I wished to let the Christmas festivities be concluded before my appearance. A few days after the commencement of the year (most likely only two or three), I expect to see you. I am going to higgle and chaffer as little more as possible about books; but to buy the few I shall need, if they cannot be got without excessive solicitation otherwise. I had a letter from Hamburg the other week, from Dr Julius, throwing fresh light on the subject. If you have not written for Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, do not write: it is one of the very few that I have any chance to find in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> by borrowing.</p>
<p>I beg that you would get the printers put in action as soon as possible; and assure them that if we were once fairly started, any thing under a sheet <hi rend="italic">per diem</hi> will fall short of my desires. Almost <hi rend="italic">two volumes</hi> are in black and white already.</p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>In the course of my investigations today, I learned that George Farries, Waffler in Ecclefechan, was to set out for Edinburgh early on Monday morning. I have determined to commit a portion of manuscript to him, that you may be duly advertised of his approach, and so enabled to send down the box, for the purpose of having it filled with luggage for me and proviant for both next time there is an opportunity. I trust the body will not lose these papers: in the event of your getting hold of them in safety, you can take them over to Tait, and tell him to set the Printers all and sundry, from Ballantyne himself to the lowest Devil of the office to work on the <hi rend="italic">copy</hi>; so that they may be in readiness for quick and earnest action the moment I arrive. The little note will explain this to Tait, indeed, without your saying any thing: only if you could get any deliverance from him before you write, it would be so much better.</p>
<p>For the last two weeks I have been very idle again, having done <pb id="pg-03-441" n="03:441"/>nothing that I can recollect save writing this very pitiful Life of Mus&#xE4;us. I have been out of books, indeed; for I cannot resolve upon this Undine of Fouqu&#xE9;&#x2019;s, till after I have seen the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Todtenbund</hi></foreign> [League of the Dead] in the Advocates&#x2019; Library. Besides I had a cold, and was forced to go hawking about for several days with a shawl round my neck. Now I am quite recovered: but still intending to pass another week without much work, writing letters and making arrangements for my departure. Indeed I should have set out directly: but the jubilee of <hi rend="italic">Hogmanay</hi> affrights me to the soul; and eighty miles from it seems too short rather than too long a distance. Ten days after this, I know not but I may be with you.</p>
<p>This day week, I rode up to Belcathill;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Dickson&#x2019;s home.</note> but found nothing there except snubby children, who were scarcely able to inform me that Frank had gone to Cannobie for an indefinite period about a fortnight before. By dint of much simple eloquence I gained admission to his book-closet; but found it stuffed, like a shop in St Mary&#x2019;s Wynd, with old trowsers and other cast apparel, and had not light or patience enough to make any strict search for the German Books; disappointed of which, I trotted gravely home again as wise as I went away. Waugh also I have again seen, while commissioning a pair of shoes from Ried; and again partaken of his <hi rend="italic">flewks</hi> [flounders], and spirit-stirring speculation. <foreign><hi rend="italic">O Pitti, nil me sicut antea juvat!</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;O Pettius, nothing pleases me as it did before!&#x201D; Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epodes</hi>, XI, i.</note> I wish this world were paved with beauty and rapture, only this modest wish, and stingy Fortune refuses me! The world continues paved with mire and tedium: and what can we do, but just struggle on till we get to the end of it? Therefore, westward ho!</p>
<p>The principal public news of this quarter is touching a sort of silver tray or epergne or waiter or some commodity of that sort which certain of the natives, instigated by &#x201C;Sandy Corrie&#x201D; have been presenting to Mr Yorkstoun our venerable parson. The value of the plate is seventy guineas of gold. Nine and thirty men sat down to dinner in the Grapes Inn yesterday, at what hour I know not, His Honour in the chair; and after a due consumpt of tough beef with wine and British spirits the tray or whatever it is was laid upon the genial board, and presented by <hi rend="italic">the</hi> General, with an appropriate speech, which he regretted that a day&#x2019;s hard hunting had prevented him from rendering more appropriate by previous meditation. Dr Simpson also sang a bawdy song. Orations (not for the Oracles<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not like Irving&#x2019;s book <hi rend="italic">For the Oracles of God, Four Orations</hi>.</note>) were delivered by various hands; <pb id="pg-03-442" n="03:442"/>and after protracting the feast of reason and the flow of soul<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pope&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Imitations of Horace</hi>, Book II, Satire I, l. 128.</note> till the keystone of the night had mounted over their heads, the meeting with extreme hilarity and glee &#x26;c &#x26;c. Will Brand, stinking with whisky like the mash-tub of the Celt, told me all this to-day, while I was searching for a book in his press and finding none.</p>
<p>Of domestic news, more interesting to you, I must not forget to mention the speculation for Shawbrae. They have offered for the farm together with Hab Hunter&#x2019;s &#x201C;Lower Bogside&#x201D; a rent of &#xa3;230, by the hands of Alick last Wednesday. Miss Welsh has also written a strong letter to Major Creighton in their favour; so that they have considerable hope of prospering, tho&#x2019; several others have offered, and are offering. It will be decided in three weeks; till which time, for this and similar concerns, there will be nothing but unbounded conjecture, and reports assuming new forms daily, and not worth listening to in any form. Our Father is in high spirits about the matter; our Mother&#x2019;s wishes are still keener tho she is &#x201C;ready to submit to His disposal&#x201D;; in fact every one (not even excepting me) is anxious for an affirmative answer.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A &#x2018;Duke&#x2019;s farm&#x2019; fallen vacant; which my brother Alick pressingly wanted, but (happily) did not get&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> With regard to the <hi rend="italic">Hill</hi>, His Honour&#x2019;s people have now changed from solicited to solicitant: they are anxious for a formal renunciation of the concern; which on certain equitable counter-engagements our agriculturists are ready to grant them.</p>
<p>You see, my dear Jack, I am leading you into our situation, not transporting myself into yours, in this epistle. Yet I am not without an apprehension of your cares and prospects, or without as deep an interest as ever in the issue of them. One very mean department of &#x201C;the Life of Man&#x201D; you must now be on the point of feeling the evils of, if they have not already overtaken you; the want of circulating capital. Can you weather till I come? If not, write instantly and I will gallop off to Annan, and get you some of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">poudre de P</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">erlimpin</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">pin</hi></foreign> [charlatan&#x2019;s dust], Quesnay&#x2019;s magic dust, which opens the hospitalities and serviceable <supplied>[functions?]</supplied> of the whole human race to him that holds it. And never mind these sublunary things for the present; but go forward <foreign><hi rend="italic">getrosten Muthes</hi></foreign> [confidently, courageously] with your Thesis, and consider the world as your oyster which in due time by one mean or another you will rend asunder. Ancient Pistol was to do it with &#x201C;sword&#x201D;;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi>, II, ii: &#x201C;Why, then the world&#x2019;s mine oyster, / Which I with sword will open.&#x201D;</note> but there are many ways to the wood. I begin to feel <pb id="pg-03-443" n="03:443"/>a very considerable contempt for the whole mystery of &#x201C;getting on&#x201D;: what the <hi rend="italic">deevil</hi> is it that a man gets on <hi rend="italic">to</hi> after all? To the wisdom of being true and honest-minded, of &#x201C;endeavouring to clear his mind from cant&#x201D;;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Boswell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> (London, <date when="1791">1791</date>), II, 454.</note> and then like Larry o&#x2019;Broom being &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">quite</hi> (quiet) there,&#x201D; and &#x201C;composing himself to his pratees.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But it is getting late; and there is no use sitting gabbling here till the keystone of the night surprise us, as it did the silver tray party this time four and and [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] twenty hours. Let us part therefore with hilarity and glee. Have you written to Haddington? The young lady says: &#x201C;Not a word from the ungrateful man of physic!&#x201D; Consume some idle hour in clearing scores with her. She is not well, and would be gratified with such a mark of your regard. On the whole, Jack, thou must be a good boy, and all will turn out sweetly. Any faults thou hast experience will cure: preserve thy faithful conscientious heart; love those that deserve love; and for those that deserve hatred, defend thyself from their presence by the &#x201C;smith&#x2019;s fingers&#x201D; so long as possible, and after that by &#x201C;act of Parliament.&#x201D; <closer><salute>Love me as well as thou canst; for I am ever thy affectionate Brother;</salute></closer></p>
<name>Thomas Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>If possible send down the Box by Farries: there is no other either here or at Mainhill (where I inquired to-day) that is road-worthy; otherwise &#x201C;your cakes and wine&#x201D; had been sent by this conveyance. If you miss Farries, and cannot write by him, write by post without loss of time, and describe to me the aspect of matters. Next time I write, I hope to appoint for you the day when we are to meet. All here salute you with kindest greetings. I enclose a piece of paper which our Mother began writing; but was forced to desist from for lack of time and matter. It is better than many more elaborate compositions, for it comes from the heart.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I must no longer postpone writing, or the fortnight will be expired, and your kind services unrepaid with even the scanty recompense of thanks. In good sooth you are a most benignant little Genius to me; <pb id="pg-03-444" n="03:444"/>and do me messages of all sorts, with the promptitude and dainty helpfulness of an Ariel. My own little Ariel! I wish I deserved you better, and could love you as I ought: you might beseem the bosom of a chivalrous Prince; and I, poor I, have neither princedom nor chivalry to share with you; nothing but a &#x201C;knapsack and fifteen florins to share with any one&#x201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle identifies the quotation as from a speech by Corporal Trim in <hi rend="italic">Tristam Shandy</hi> (ed. of <date when="1794">1794</date>), III, 133: &#x201C;My fever ran very high that night&#x2014;her figure made sad disturbance within me&#x2014;I was every moment cutting the world in two&#x2014;to give her half of it&#x2014;and every moment was I crying, That I had nothing but a knapsack and eighteen florins to share with her.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>You should feel some contentment with your present lot, how untoward soever in other points, for the service it enables you to do to others. There is honest James Johnstone the most meritorious of pedagogues; by your means he is going to be a made man. I had a letter from him the other week, brimful of this one subject; for James is a nervous character, and longs with trembling hope to be at anchor, after his perplexed voyaging, tho&#x2019; it were in the meagre roadstead of the Haddington parish school. He is making interest with Earls and Lords and Principalities and Powers, as Gilbert Burns directs him; and unless the Fates are more than usually shrewish, certainly &#x201C;to Goodness&#x201D; the honest man will reach the high top-gallant of his joy, before the close of the ensuing month. I encouraged him with a glimpse of your good deeds towards him, and wrote out a most peremptory Testimonial for his use, which indeed was nothing more than he deserved. I owe you much for these exertions in a matter so foreign to your own habits, and should not owe you less tho&#x2019; the issue disappointed us.</p>
<p>And for this Epistle Recommendatory to <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Major, I now heartily rejoice that I asked it of you: it will be a new tie of gratitude betwixt us; and this is not the least precious of acquisitions, tho&#x2019; you cannot take it to the market, and sell it by weight or measure. My own Jane! I am surely an unbelieving man, a genuine representative of the Doubting Thomas in the Gospel: I sometimes feel as if you had not yet got possession of the tithe of my heart; as if by persisting in this self-denial you would long hence <hi rend="italic">convince</hi> me, and force me to trust in you with my whole being, and then I should be yours not in word or even in deed, but in thought and life, &#x201C;one soul, one mind, one body,&#x201D; one thro&#x2019; all vicissitudes and fortunes now and forevermore. &#x201C;What a story! The creature not mine after all? Whose then? I protest, the foolish soul is made of ice, or rather rock, for ice would <pb id="pg-03-445" n="03:445"/>have thawed long ago, had I warmed it but half so much!&#x201D; Be patient, my gentle Darling! Rock also may be &#x201C;cast into fusion&#x201D;; and the melting will be the more impetuous, and the figure it is moulded into the more enduring.</p>
<p>As to the practical result of this kind letter, it is still uncertain; tho nothing but good is to be expected from it. Alick gave in his offer on Wednesday gone a week, and was informed by His Majorship, who received him with great courtesy, that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> must go to London before these matters could be settled, but that in three weeks something certain would be known. The Major it seems is a manpleaser in his acceptance of offers; favours to none, to all he smiles extends; and every one has some secret hope that the urn of De<supplied>[s]</supplied>tiny will cast out the prize for himself. Meanwhile all is patient waiting for the stirring of the waters: our agriculturists have offered &#xa3;230 for the farm, and everyone is anxious more or less that the offer be accepted. If it be, the whole household will have daily cause to remember their Autumn visitor, and to bless her kind name every seedtime and every harvest; for Shawbrae is beyond comparison superior in comfort and convenience to Mainhill, and I know not that the Grand Duke Constantine would feel as much real happiness in wresting the boundless Empire of all the Russias from his rival Brother, as these sunburnt men in acquiring that piece of &#x201C;<foreign>bonny</foreign> dry land&#x201D; from <hi rend="italic">Hab of Meinfoot</hi> and the other eager competitors. So true is it that &#x201C;the mind of man is modified by circumstances&#x201D;; a truth which I know not whether you have ever remarked, tho&#x2019; it has long been pa<supplied>[r]</supplied>tially known to philosophers of a metaphysical turn. My Mother would like to go to Shawbrae almost as well as you would do to be Queen of England; but she leaves it all &#x201C;to His Disposal, for what is good the Lord will give.&#x201D; Could she do more if crowns and sceptres were the stake? She also told me that she &#x201C;kenn&#x2019;d you would write,&#x201D; tho&#x2019; by what magic intimations she came to ken it was not stated. The good mother speaks of you almost daily, and loves you as truly as any other does except myself.</p>
<p>But I must quit my tattling, for this is the last page. You will grieve, as I do, that for the last two weeks I have again been forced into idle habits. My books were all exhausted; and except writing a sorry sketch of a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> for Mus&#xE4;us, I have done nothing! I should have been in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> ere now; but I dreaded the Christmas jollifications, and contented myself with despatching a portion of manuscript to set the printers in motion before my arrival, which must now take place, as I reckon, early next week. This Book is but a confused piece of work, and very <pb id="pg-03-446" n="03:446"/>little to my taste, after all the trouble I can take with it. Next time&#x2014;precious <hi rend="italic">next</hi> time! What I am to do this next time, nevertheless, is still enveloped in the mantle of night. It will be long, long, before I can do my best, bad as this poor best may prove. You bid me show you all the imaginations of my heart: but some of them are much too crude for your inspection. Sometimes I almost think of asking you to wed with me as things are, and set forth by my side to&#x2014;beg thro&#x2019; the world, for there were little else that we could hope to do at present! One [on] the whole, however, I am not disconsolate, or in straits about my future course. I think myself on the right <supplied>[w]</supplied>ay at present, whatever others do, for my health I believe is distin<supplied>[ctly im]</supplied>proving, and this is more to me and those that love me than mines of gold. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Patientia</hi>! <hi rend="italic">Patientia</hi></foreign>! The day <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come, my day and yours, and we shall know what it is to be happy with such happiness as this world can give, and blessed in one another with a happiness that breathes of better worlds.</p>
<p>At your request I have written to the Noble Lady, a letter full of metaphorical disclosures,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> truer than any she ever got from me before. Last night also I saw her son. It was my first visit to Ruthwell;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Home of the Rev. Henry Duncan and his family. Mrs. Montagu was afraid of the influence that Carlyle might have on her son Charles.</note> where I spent a more inter<supplied>[e]</supplied>sting evening than had fallen to my lot for many a week, tho it needed all my nerve to cause my ass to be saddled and determine on the mighty enterprise. Young Montague awoke for two moments, at sight of me, from his usual lock-and-key condition: at meeting and at parting, he came towards me, and actually shook hands with some touch of cordiality. The boy is a curious boy: he is made of human with even some angelic materials, but they are kneaded together by the Devil. Another of Montague&#x2019;s sons, I was shocked to learn, is gone deranged! He was a kind simple soul whom I used to see in London: another brother of his (they are both half brothers to <foreign>Moniseur</foreign> Charles) has gone even a worse road, in spite of all his father could strive. The Noble Lady must have had wild times of it among them!</p>
<p>From &#x201C;Julia Strachey&#x201D; I hear nothing, tho&#x2019; I have written to her <hi rend="italic">twice</hi>, and spent the other night in dreaming about her and Catherine Aurora,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Kirkpatrick.</note> one of the most &#x201C;imaginative&#x201D; dreams I have had for many a month. &#x201C;O may the Devil take them both!&#x201D; Soft now, my <foreign>bonny</foreign> Jane, not the real Devil, the ugly black Satanas! I declare they are very <pb id="pg-03-447" n="03:447"/>praiseworthy persons, and I love them both with a love <foreign><hi rend="italic">ganz bruderlich</hi></foreign> [altogether brotherly]. So shall you too by and by <foreign><hi rend="italic">ganz schwesterlich</hi></foreign> [altogether sisterly].</p>
<p>I long for more and more details about your studies and proceedings. Has that ugly fit of sickness <hi rend="italic">altogether</hi> left you? Exercise and care in regimen, I repeat it again and again, are your only safety, and at present you<supplied>[r]</supplied> most imperative duty. Be sedulous in discharging it for the love of <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, if you had no other reason! What of your <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>? Shall I see it, when I come to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>? For you<supplied>[r]</supplied> Mother, do not let her unkindness afflict you: answer it by contrary conduct; if you think it foolish and harsh, be you the more wise and gentle. This it is to overcome evil with good, the only proper weapon to resist it with. But here comes Jane, <foreign><hi rend="italic">accincta ad scribendum</hi></foreign> [girded for writing]! I must give way.</p>
<p>[Jane writes the lines given below;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;My dear Miss Welsh, I am sorry to think that I have dissoppointed your hopes of me with regard to my latin: for I know that you love me and art interested in all that concerns me. but to carry it on as it ought to have been done was truely beyond the utmost compass of my ability in the circumstances I was placed in.

It seems likely I may leave <hi rend="italic">the Hill</hi> on Tuesday-morning, by five o&#x2019;clock, and intercept the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Coach at Moffatt. I heard of you last night from a fair young lady, who had caught some rumour of our visit to Grange: When shall I see you, and hear of you from your own lips? <closer><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Adiez Se&#xf1;oretta</hi></foreign> [Farewell, my Lady]!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>I am unwilling to commence our correspondence under evil auspices; so I shall not fatigue you with any long-winded apology. I merely declare, as I am a christian woman and hope to be saved, my delay in answering your letter has not proceeded from forgetfulness&#x2014;on the contrary the idea that you might be feeling anxious about me has often twinged my conscience very severely. But (as I told you before) <hi rend="italic">I can do nothing when I have visitors to attend to</hi>. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baillie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Capt. James Baillie, see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240917-JBW-TC-01"><sic>3:149&#x2013;50</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1824-09-17">17 Sept. 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> who accompanied us hither went away only yesterday, and there has been a host of people here besides.</p>
<p>So you think my sweet cousin unamiable, do you? Blessings on your modest assurance! Depend upon it M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Dugald your critical sagacity is in this instance at fault&#x2014; You know as little of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baillie as of the great Mogul&#x2014;not that I question your penetration by no means&#x2014;I would not be so sceptical for all the the [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] world: but I hold it impossible for you, or I, or any <hi rend="italic">semi-barbarian</hi> whatever, to comprehend <hi rend="italic">at a glance</hi> a character so wrapt and disguised in the manner of fashionable life, as this M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baillie is. For my part I have studied him for a month&#x2014;harder than I ever studied the crampest German&#x2014;and I confess I have not even now a right idea of him in my mind. There are still intricacies in his character which I cannot unravel, inconsistencies which I cannot reconcile&#x2014;but nevertheless I understand him well enough to love him after no every-day fashion&#x2014; I know him to be true and affectionate in his nature&#x2014;manly in his feelings&#x2014;magnificent in his whole manner of being. and if these qualities joined to perfection of beauty, perfection of native elegance and courtly polish do not make up an amiable man&#x2014;will you tell me in God&#x2019;s name what an amiable man is?&#x2014; My Cousin you perceive is a favorite with me as well as with my Mother, so no more reflections against his <hi rend="italic">amiability</hi> please! in case I should take a fancy to beat you with a stick&#x2014;just to teach you good manners&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It is long since I had any direct tidings of you; only, by the Newspapers, I observe that you are going on with as much alacrity <supplied>[as]</supplied> ever, in the great business of illuminating this lower world. I trust your shelves are by this time nearly clear of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, and ready for some new adventure. The reception of the work has on the whole considerably surpassed my expectations; and I believe more confidently than ever that ultimately it will come into much wider circulation. Exactly in the ratio of any man&#x2019;s faculties, and experience with literature and life, do I find his verdict favourable. <hi rend="italic">Smalls</hi> of every description flout at it; call it absurd, and wicked, and so forth; while every truly thinking man of my acquaintance (with scarcely one exception) pronounces quite an opposite opinion. I have read such &#x201C;reviews&#x201D; of the work!&#x2014; As if a fly were to, light upon the top of St Giles&#x2019; steeple, and paint a panoramic <hi rend="italic">view</hi> of Edinburgh! But, poor devils! They must live as well as other people; let them have their palaver, it will harm no one.&#x2014; From Goethe himself I had lately a very pleasant letter, with two little books, sent hither by Lord Bentinck. He is bright as ever; has more in him than any other score of men in Europe.</p>
<p>But it was of a fresh project I meant to write; not of me <supplied>[one]</supplied> already executed. At the present time I am printing for Taylor &#x26; Hess<supplied>[e]</supplied>y a book entitled &#x2018;Schiller&#x2019;s Life&#x2019; with extracts &#x26;c, the greater part of which appeared some time ago in their Magazine; and ever since I began to work at it, I have been meditating a scheme of giving to the world a complete Translation of all <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x2019;s Works</hi>, historical philosophical and dramatic. Excepting Goethe, Schiller is undoubtedly the greatest man among the Germans; in this country he is considered the greatest without any exception. Of his works not one line (excepting <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi> by Coleridge) has been tolerably translated; many of them not at all, tho&#x2019; their names and hearsay merits have long been familiar to us thro&#x2019; the medium of De Sta&#xEB;l. Coleridge&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi> is about to go to press for a second edition: it lay twenty years unnoticed, and now bids fair to retrieve itself.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">The Life of Friedrich Schiller, Works</hi>, XXV, 151 n., Carlyle writes: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi> has been translated into French by M. Benjamin Constant; and the last two parts of it have been faithfully rendered into English by Mr. Coleridge. As to the French version, we know nothing, save that it is an <hi rend="italic">improved</hi> one; but that little is enough: Schiller, as a dramatist, improved by M. Constant, is a spectacle we feel no wish to witness. Mr. Coleridge&#x2019;s translation is also, as a whole, unknown to us: but judging from many large specimens, we should pronounce it, excepting Sotheby&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>, to be the best, indeed the only sufferable, translation from the German with which our literature has yet been enriched.&#x201D;</note> The dramatic works I observe have lately been published in five handsome volumes at Paris, translated into French <hi rend="italic">prose</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres dramatiques de F. Schiller, traduites de l&#x2019;allemand, pr&#xE9;c&#xE9;d&#xE9;es d&#x2019;une notice biographique et litt&#xE9;raire sur Schiller</hi>, F <hi rend="italic">vols.</hi> (Paris, <date when="1821">1821</date>).</note> On the whole, I have little doubt that properly seconded by a publisher, this enterprise would be a profitable one.</p>
<p>At the same time it is one which requires spirit and capital; and knowledge of business also, for it may be managed in a great variety of ways. Schiller&#x2019;s works in the original amount to twelve octavo volumes (as large as those of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, almost exactly); of which about seven are in poetry, or perhaps eight; the rest in prose. The poetry (nearly all <hi rend="italic">plays</hi>) if well rendered could scarcely fail of being instantly popular; the same also to a less extent might be said of the Histories (works of sterling talent, tho&#x2019; less adapted for this flimsy period); while the philosophic writings (tho&#x2019; the deepest and most truly novel and important of any) would require an introductory half volume and a copious commentary before any person would properly comprehend them. They treat of <hi rend="italic">Kant</hi> and his system; which <hi rend="italic">must</hi> in the long run meet with at least an <hi rend="italic">examination</hi> in this country, and a <hi rend="italic">rational</hi> rejection or acceptance.</p>
<p>Now these things might be published separately or not as one judged best; perhaps the dramatic works first, in a form corresponding to this <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi>, of which you are like to receive a supply of copies by the next (the <date when="1825-02">Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>) arrival. It is a good enough book of its kind; and had <hi rend="italic">you</hi> published it, might very soon have sold. It contains scenes from various of the plays; which any one curious on the subject may consult as specimens of my manner of translating. I rather think I shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> put my name to it: but if I engaged in the present business, I could announce it at the end of this <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, and refer to the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> again in our advertisements.</p>
<p>Now the question is: Do you think this in any shape a plausible speculation? If you do, be so good as let me have your ideas on the subject, and we will try to make a bargain. The advantage of an active Publisher, at least in regard to present comfort, is a thing which I have proved by a little experience of late: to higgle and chaffer about bargaining; and then besitate and loiter and dally in performing, is a thing which I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> endure, and which I should not have to fear with you.</p>
<p><supplied>[This]</supplied> is a subject, this project of mine, in which I have hardly <supplied>[yet]</supplied> spoken to any one. If you see meet, you may of course consult your literary friends in the matter; but further, you need not be told, that publicity is not desireable [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. I expect to hear from you as soon as possible. Nothing detains me <hi rend="italic">fixedly</hi> here but the printing of this book: it is very likely that in some few weeks I may be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>.</p>
<p>I have written in great haste, that I might not lose a post: you will answer me without the smallest necessary delay.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have just received a letter from your son, informing me that you are now at Bolton Abbey, and would like to see me there. Charles tells me that the scenery is grander than I can form any notion of; that the walks and so forth are beyond all praise. Badams also, it appears, is with you.</p>
<p>Beautiful still Nature, and a kind welcome to enjoy it! Clear skies and shady walks, and the company of &#x201C;my soul-curer and my body-curer&#x201D;! <pb id="pg-04-442" n="04:442"/>These are indeed temptations. For the sake of this, it were a small matter to be bottled up for eight-and-forty hours in a stagecoach, with Manchester manufacturers, and to stand the greasy horrors of Yorkshire inns; in half a day I should have drunk of Lethe, and forgotten all the miseries of my pilgrimage, in the fulness of that Elysium. But alas! for me there is no Elysium there! I have spent my summer idle and asleep; my tasks are all ahead of me, and I am struggling in the midst of resolutions and regrets, like a sluggish labourer at the eleventh hour. Be thankful that I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> come! In general I am but indifferent company in pursuit of pleasure; often you would liken me, at present, to Butler&#x2019;s &#x201C;dog distract, or monkey sick.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210612-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1821-06-12">12 June 1821</date></ref>.</note> Be happy without me: another time I hope to join you under kindlier auspices.</p>
<p>If it were not that you were come to Bolton Abbey to cast away remembrances and anticipations alike, and live only for the present, I would ask you to devote some rainy morning to writing me a letter. I hear little of England and my kind friends in it, and desire to hear much. Badams too is away from the metallic din of Birmingham, and owes me a full sheet. Give my very kindest compliments to him, and say that whether he write or not, I can never forget him. Is Mrs Montague well? I am her debtor, for the last eight weeks. Sinner that I am!</p>

<p><bold>Act I. Scene I.</bold> An Inn</p>
<p>Enter Lord Clarence &#x26; D&#x2019;Auville.</p>
<p><bold>D&#x2019;Auville</bold></p>
<q><l>My Lord, indulge not unavailing grief;</l>
<l>All may be well; thy son may yet exist,</l>
<l>And years of happiness to come</l>
<l>Reward the<supplied>[e]</supplied> for thy many sorrows past&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>L.C.</bold>  Oh! Tell not me of happiness!</l>
<l>My ears are unaccustomed to the sound</l>
<l>I once indeed possessed the heavenly gift;</l>
<l>But Oh: twas but to feel its loss more great</l>
<l>Its very shadow has deserted me</l>
<l>D&#x2019;Auville thou hast never yet fully learned</l>
<l>The fatal causes of thy friends distress;</l>
<l>And tho&#x2019; the sad recital gives me pain,</l>
<l>&#x2019;Twill ease my heart to share its griefs with thee</l></q>
<q><l><bold>D.A</bold>  Would you could give me all,</l>
<l>For you too long have borne the heavy load;</l>
<l>Despair, too long, has sat upon thy brow;</l>
<l>Too long has chid the least approach of hope&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>L.C.</bold>  When you have heard my wretched story</l>
<l>You will judge how much Ive cause to mourn&#x2014;</l>
<l>The lovely Julia first enslaved my heart,</l>
<l>The Daughter of a nobleman of Lisbon.</l>
<l>Her noble race, and wealth, tho&#x2019; powerful</l>
<l>Appeared to me, as far beneath herself</l>
<l>As tapers burning in the brilliant day.</l>
<l>I loved, And (Oh, transporting thought)</l>
<l>I was beloved&#x2014;</l>
<l>Her father kindly gave her to my arms:</l>
<l>Oh! I shall ne&#x2019;er forget the blissful hour</l>
<l>That joined our hands and made the Angel mine&#x2014;</l>
<l>A rapid year passed on in perfect bliss;</l>
<l>Then heaven gave an Infant to my arms;</l>
<l>Each youthful grace adorned the lovely boy;</l>
<l>Forgive a father&#x2019;s fondness&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>D.&#x2019;A.</bold>  Go on my Lord, I long to hear,</l>
<l>What unforseen event,</l>
<l>Could cause so great a change&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>L.C.</bold> Another year rolled on</l>
<l>Blessed as the former,</l>
<l>And then, another son, his mother&#x2019;s image,</l>
<l>Clung to my happy heart&#x2014;</l>
<l>I heard at length, the tidings of my fathers death;</l>
<l>I wished to visit once again my native realm&#x2014;</l>
<l>Julia, and my Theodore embarked</l>
<l>In the first vessel, w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> for England sailed&#x2014;;</l>
<l>Oh. fatal rashness, why did we ever part?</l>
<l>For then at least we might have died together</l>
<l>Britain they neer were destined to behold</l>
<l>The ship was lost amidst the merciless waves</l>
<l>And in the Ocean all my hopes were sunk&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>D&#x2019;A</bold>  Say not all my Lord,</l>
<l>You had yet one comfort left</l></q>
<q><l><bold>L.C.</bold> My son, you mean?&#x2014;</l>
<l>Oh! no.</l>
<l>My Frederick too was severed from my arms;</l>
<l>With him, I mournfully embarked;</l>
<l>Almost wishing that another storm</l>
<l>Would, Once again unite me to my Julia&#x2014;</l>
<l>Another lot, fate had decreed for us;</l>
<l>Our ship became the Conquest of the Moors,</l>
<l>And we Ourselves their slaves:&#x2014;</l>
<l>The monsters deaf to all a fathers prayers</l>
<l>Tore the helpless infant from my arms;</l>
<l>nor have I ever since beheld my Boy;</l>
<l>Ten dismal years of slavery rolled on&#x2014;</l>
<l>At length a country man,</l>
<l>Enslaved as well as I, escaped,</l>
<l>And with a generosity scarce ever found</l>
<l>But in a Briton&#x2019;s soul,</l>
<l>Obtained my ransom&#x2014;</l>
<l>For six years more I vainly sought my child</l>
<l>And now, heart-broken, childless, in despair,</l>
<l>I have returned to die among my friends&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>D&#x2019;A.</bold>  Since you have dismissed all earthly hope,</l>
<l>Yet there is consolation;</l>
<l>No guilt of yours hath caused your sufferings,</l>
<l>And Heaven will in joy drown the despair,</l>
<l>which it has doomed to be on earth they share&#x2014;</l></q>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p><bold>Scene II</bold></p>
<p>An apartment in the Castle</p>
<q><l><bold>Adelaide</bold> alone (weeping)</l>
<l>Oh! cruel, cruel fortune</l></q>
<p>enter Mortimer</p>
<q><l><bold>Mort:</bold>  My Life, My Adelaide, what mean these tears:</l>
<l>Oh! Tell me quickly nor refuse your Mortimer</l>
<l>The privelege [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of love&#x2014;to share thy sorrows</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Adel:</bold>  Who w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not weep?</l>
<l>Oh! Mortimer the cloud w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> long has hung</l>
<l>Suspended o&#x2019;er our love</l>
<l>At length has burst</l>
<l>And the dark storm of woe</l>
<l>Falls thick on every side</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Mort:</bold>  Alas! what means my Love?</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Adel:</bold>  Fain w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> my tongue deny its office,</l>
<l>And refuse to wound thy gentle breast;</l>
<l>But sorrow, bursting from my painful heart;</l>
<l>Compels my voice to give it utterance&#x2014;</l>
<l>Yes Mortimer,</l>
<l>Stern duty bids us part,</l>
<l>And Adelaide must obey.</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Mort&#x2014;</bold>Just Heavens! my fears then were not groundless</l>
<l>I long have marked the partial eye</l>
<l>With w<hi rend="italic">h yr</hi> father views y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> youthful stranger,</l>
<l>And he has destined him (distraction&#x2019;s in the thought)</l>
<l>For adelaide&#x2019;s Husband;</l>
<l>Is it not so?</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Adel:</bold>  It is but too true&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Mort</bold>  This is a blow indeed:</l>
<l>Support me Heaven or I sink beneath it&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Adel&#x2014;</bold>Mortimer hear me&#x2014;</l>
<l>Ever since my Sainted mother&#x2019;s death,</l>
<l>My fathers comfort has been placed in me,</l>
<l>And shall I now with disobedience,</l>
<l>Reward his tender care, his anxious love,</l>
<l>And blast at once his fondest hopes;</l>
<l>Oh! no! it must not be:</l>
<l>Yet if you look so very very wretched,</l>
<l>Affection, duty, every thing will yield</l>
<l>To love and Mortimer&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Mort.</bold>  No Adelaide I shall try to hide my misery;</l>
<l>This sacrifice is due to gratitude;</l>
<l>De Courcy shall receive the life w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> his humanity preserved.</l>
<l>For think not I can ever live, to see the<supplied>[e]</supplied> made another&#x2019;s,</l>
<l>At present virtue bids me fly&#x2014;</l>
<l>My Adelaide farewell for ever&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Adel.</bold>  Oh will you leave me when I most need a friend?</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Mort.</bold>  Does Adelaide bid me stay?</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Adel:</bold> Indeed you must not go;</l>
<l>For my poor heart is almost burst already,</l>
<l>And that <hi rend="italic">wd</hi> break it quite;</l>
<l>Duty doth but feebly resist</l>
<l>Such powerful love as mine&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Mort.</bold>  Away then sorrow, and each gloomy care,</l>
<l>Since Adelaide loves me still, I&#x2019;ve nought to fear</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Adel&#x2014;</bold>Duty calls me one way, love another,</l>
<l>Between the two my peace is lost for ever&#x2014;</l>
<l>Away&#x2014;My father comes;</l>
<l>He must not see you here</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Mort</bold>  My dearest love, my adelaide <foreign>adieu</foreign>;</l>
<l>But tho&#x2019; I go my heart is still with you&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Exit</hi>.</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Adel:</bold>  What shall I say! I cannot bear his anger&#x2014;</l></q>
<p>Enter De Courcy</p>
<q><l><bold>De C.</bold>  Still, Still in tears, and why?.</l>
<l>Because I wish to make you happy&#x2014;</l>
<l>Once adelaide I thought I had a child</l>
<l>who w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not thus have vexed her parents heart</l>
<l>But now I find how great was the mistake</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Adel.</bold>  Oh! my father, look not on me thus:</l>
<l>That frown will kill me&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>De C.</bold>  Adelaide, I beg, entreat you,</l>
<l>If you ever loved me,</l>
<l>If you regard your future happiness,</l>
<l>Now by your conduct show it;</l>
<l>But if you still refuse my only prayer</l>
<l>For once I must command;</l>
<l>If Adelaide forgets she is my child,</l>
<l>I shall forget it too&#x2014;</l>
<l>And act a tyrants part&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Adel.</bold>  Had you commanded me aught else on earth,</l>
<l>were it to die I&#x2019;<hi rend="italic">d</hi> willingly obey:</l>
<l>To this, and this alone, I never can consent;</l>
<l>Horatio&#x2019;s misfortunes, virtues &#x26; his youth</l>
<l>Have gained him my esteem;</l>
<l>But more I cannot give&#x2014;</l>
<l>Then my loved father on my bended knees, (Kneeling<supplied>[)]</supplied></l>
<l>Let me entreat you,</l>
<l>Not to make your child for ever wretched&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>De C.</bold>  Ill hear no more: your prayers all are in vain;</l>
<l>My word is past; nor shall a womans tears</l>
<l>Make me recall it&#x2014;</l>
<l>Mark well my words,</l>
<l>Or you&#x2019;ll repent this obstinacy,</l>
<l>And violence shall obtain what duty ought to give</l></q>
<p>Exit&#x2014;</p>
<q><l><bold>Adel.</bold>  Open thou earth and hide me from his anger&#x2014;</l>
<l>Oh! Mortimer when my poor father found thee</l>
<l>Deserted and forlorn upon the shore a helpless Babe,</l>
<l>He little thought that thou shouldst be the cause of so much misery to my poor heart&#x2014;</l>
<l>I&#x2019;ll seek Horatio,</l>
<l>And throw myself upon his goodness,</l>
<l>(My last remaining hope) Exit&#x2014;</l></q>
<p><bold>Scene III</bold> An apartment in Horatio&#x2019;s House</p>
<p>Enter Horatio &#x26; Oreztan&#x2014;</p>
<q><l><bold>Horatio&#x2014;</bold></l>
<l>Oreztan I do fear me much,</l>
<l>Your health agrees not with the English clime</l>
<l>And now indeed I do repent me,</l>
<l>That I e&#x2019;er yielded to your rash request,</l>
<l>To bring me with you from your native land&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Orez:</bold>  The Sorrows of a Heart with woe oerpowered</l>
<l>And not the clime, affect my health Horatio</l>
<l>And Oh! where can I hope that they will cease?</l>
<l>If not in England&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Hor</bold>  Your words are still mysterious,</l>
<l>Nor do I seek to know their meaning,</l>
<l>For oft with pain I have observed,</l>
<l>When I e&#x2019;er touched upon your life o&#x2019;erpast&#x2014;</l>
<l>The very thought seemed to harrass your Soul;</l>
<l>But you have left your Country, all, for me;</l>
<l>Sure then each care that friendship can bestow,</l>
<l>Must needs be yours&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Orez:</bold>  By Our Prophet I do know the<supplied>[e]</supplied> well,</l>
<l>And know the generous nature</l>
<l>Of the manly breast,</l>
<l>But my griefs are not like to those of other men</l>
<l>And therefore undisclosed they must remain,</l>
<l>Until the time that fate reveal them&#x2014;</l>
<l>But let me beg</l>
<l>That thou wilt say no more upon this subject;</l>
<l>How stand your hopes with Adelaide?</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Hor:</bold>  Would I could say well!</l>
<l>But tho&#x2019; her father doth assist my suit,</l>
<l>She herself is still, as ever, cold;</l>
<l>But yet I hope and trust she may relent&#x2014;</l>
<l>Now to the Castle let us bend our way,</l>
<l>I fear to see her, yet I dare not stay</l></q>
<p>Exeunt&#x2014;</p>
<p><bold>Scene 4&#x2014;</bold>A garden near the Castle</p>
<p>Enter Mortimer&#x2014;</p>
<q><l><bold>Mort:</bold>  All nature seems to mourn for Adelaides woes:</l>
<l>Why do I say for Adelaides?</l>
<l>Are not my own as great?</l>
<l>Oh! yes&#x2014;and greater far;</l>
<l>But in her tears my sorrows are forgot.</l>
<l>The Birds have ceased to tune their joyous strain,</l>
<l>And plaintive notes express their sympathy;</l>
<l>The Sun has sunk beneath the lowering clouds,</l>
<l>Which sprinkle all around with pitying tears;</l>
<l>The roses droop &#x26; wither in their bloom&#x2014;</l>
<l>A mournful emblem of my hapless love&#x2014;</l></q>
<p>Enter Stanmore</p>
<q><l><bold>Stan</bold>  &#x201C;Hapless love&#x201D;&#x2014;what means this said <supplied>[sad]</supplied> complaint?</l>
<l>Has the fair shrine w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> humbly you adore</l>
<l>Refused to grant what vows &#x26; prayers seek?</l>
<l>Or has some young, some pretty sighing fool</l>
<l>Woo&#x2019;d the inconstant fair one from your arms,</l>
<l>And triumphed in a heart not worth the having?</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Mort</bold>  Cease Stanmore to profane</l>
<l>With a blaspheming tongue,</l>
<l>The truest, loveliest, best of women&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Stan</bold>  Lovely she is; but true she cannot be;</l>
<l>Or if she is indeed, why then, she is the first</l>
<l>That e&#x2019;er beneath an Angel&#x2019;s form</l>
<l>Concealed an Angel&#x2019;s mind&#x2014;</l>
<l>I have abjured them all;</l>
<l>For all are treacherous alike&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Mort.</bold>  Oh no! My Adelaide is excellence itself&#x2014;</l></q>
<q><l><bold>Stan</bold>  So I once thought Zalniora;</l>
<l>She too was lovely and I thought her true;</l>
<l>But oh! how fatally was I deceived&#x2014;</l>
<l>when first my eyes beheld the beauteous slave</l>
<l>My heart confessed her charms more powerful far</l></q>
