<p>The letters of this volume show the same pattern as other recent volumes. It includes 256 letters, of which Thomas Carlyle wrote 195 and Jane Carlyle 61. Slightly more than 49 percent, or 126, have not appeared before, and, of the rest, 73 have not been published in full. A further 10 percent have appeared in periodicals, various biographies, and other publications and about the same number in volumes of collected letters. So the claim is still made that this edition steadily shows for the first time how the two Carlyles saw their lives. The letters relate to Thomas&#x2019;s writing and what the two of them thought, whom they met, what was happening around them, how others saw them, their activities at home and abroad and their response to each other.</p>
<p>Certain features stand out in <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>. It was the year when &#x201C;scolding&#x201C; reviewers took up the <hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling</hi>, and Carlyle slightly revised it. If he seemed uncertain what to do next, it was a pivotal time. We see him beginning to turn to Germany again with the challenge of writing on Frederick the Great. He had thought of it in the early <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>s and after, when other writers such as Macaulay were also attracted to him. Unimpressed by British prosperity and recent events in France, and adopting a historical rather than a prophetic perspective, he turned to Frederick&#x2019;s Prussia almost reluctantly. We are brought closer to him as he considers this in his letters and in snatches from his Journal (made use of for the first time since Froude), and on his visit to Germany.</p>
<p>Carlyle can sometimes be easily dismissed; but though even he was often ready to play up to being a caricature of prejudice, he still responded almost as readily to present events as at the time of Chartism, the condition-of-England, or the Irish famine. He was more than a match for Gladstone in resisting his complacent attempt to find a job of running the London Library for his prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;, James Lacaita. What we are to make of Carlyle&#x2019;s scorn for Disraeli is another matter, &#x201C;that scandalous Jew-swindler,&#x201C; etc. (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18521221-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady Ashburton</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1852-12-21">21 December</date></ref>): it may go with his admiration for Peel&#x2019;s integrity, and his own sympathy for free trade and cheap bread. Yet in spite of Carlyle&#x2019;s authoritarianism and the influence of the Ashburton group, he had little time for the new Emperor of France. Nor ought we to marvel that, just as a few years before he had been sought out by the revolutionary Cavaignac, or fervent nationalists from Ireland such as John Mitchel, he was now approached by the great Russian writer and radical, Alexander Herzen, introduced by Mazzini&#x2019;s followers.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-xii" n="27:xii"/>It is true that the record of the letters can be extremely tantalizing, as we find for example in their glance at Carlyle&#x2019;s encounter with Herzen. There are no letters between them in <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>. Yet here is a man at the center of political thought and action in Europe who was an intense admirer of Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> and other writings, who had sent him some of his works, and whose respect was returned. Almost as soon as he landed in England he called at Cheyne Row and joined in vigorous discussion. Yet Carlylean biography has known nothing about him; and though there is the record of two letters mentioning him (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18520912-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1852-09-12">12 Sept. 1852</date>]</ref> and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520915-JWC-JAC-01">JWC to <sic>John Carlyle</sic><corr>JAC</corr>, [<date when="1852-09-15">15 Sept. 1852</date>]</ref>), less is said of their connection than of problems with the builders or Nero the dog. It has been left to Sven Stelling-Michaud to discuss it in his <foreign>&#x201C;Herzen et Thomas Carlyle&#x201C;</foreign>; in Marc Vuilemien, Stelling-Michaud and others, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Autour d&#x2019;Alexandre Herzen. Documents in&#xE9;dits</hi></foreign> (Geneva: Librairie Droz, <date when="1973-00-00">1973</date>, 325&#x2013;29), in an account unnoticed in Carlylean bibliography, sought out by Professor David Sorensen, and now used here.</p>
<p>Herzen wrote to friends that Carlyle&#x2019;s wife had invited him to Cheyne Row: &#x201C;<foreign>Vous connaissez son <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la r&#xE9;volution.</hi> Lui-m&#xEA;me n&#x2019;est pas l&#xE0;, et il aime beaucoup mon &#x2018;Vom Anderen Ufer&#x2019;</foreign> [From the Other Shore],&#x201C; and that Carlyle wished to get to know him (<date when="1852-09-14">14 September</date>). He explained that it turned out that Carlyle was <foreign>&#x201C;un amateur de mes petites choses,&#x201C;</foreign> just as in return he had admired <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> (<date when="1852-09-16">16 September</date>). They at last met at Cheyne Row, about <date when="1852-12-20">20 December</date>, when Herzen says that they spent the whole evening together, Carlyle proving to be like his <hi rend="italic">History</hi>, with a <foreign>&#x201C;talent touchant au g&#xE9;nie,&#x201C;</foreign> showing boldness mixed with folly. They were in conflict because Carlyle&#x2019;s absurdity was to believe that the world could be saved by despotism, thus averting socialism. Herzen demanded, &#x201C;Have you ever read Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of the Revolution?</hi> There&#x2019;s a writer who understands the matter better and more profoundly than you. That brought laughter.&#x201C; &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a man of immense ability, but too paradoxical. He could be called a Scotch Proudhon.&#x201C; For his part, Carlyle is said to have written to Herzen in <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>, &#x201C;I should be well pleased to have another meeting&#x201C; (Stelling-Michaud 326).</p>
<p>Herzen&#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">Vom anderen Ufer</hi></foreign> (Hamburg <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>) was a work to excite Carlyle&#x2019;s attention, and for all its revolutionary fervor was by no means as much in favor of democracy as Stelling-Michaud implies. Nor were they even so entirely opposed about the new Emperor and his recent coup as he suggests; to Carlyle, Louis Napoleon was a mere &#x201C;Opera King,&#x201C; not quite as bad as the ineffective &#x201C;democracy of 900 talking lawyers&#x201C; that he replaced. They were alike in questioning, as Herzen put it, &#x201C;the state forms&#x201C; of France and other European countries, which were essentially incompatible &#x201C;with liberty, equality, and fraternity,&#x201C; and always would be even under liberal governments. <pb id="pg-27-xiii" n="27:xiii"/>Himself influenced by Proudhon, Herzen fiercely criticized the new political faiths, which demanded violence for the sake of abstract causes or future generations: inspired by German Romantic doctrine, that kind of thinking appealed to both reactionaries and revolutionaries. The apostles of &#x201C;progress&#x201C; invested such words as &#x201C;democracy&#x201C; with mythical significance. In strikingly Carlylean language, Herzen warned that &#x201C;there is no real creation in democracy, and that is why it is not the future. The future is outside politics, the future soars above the chaos of all political and social aspirations and picks out from them threads to weave into a new cloth which will provide the winding-sheet for the past and the swaddling clothes for the newborn&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">From the Other Shore</hi>, trans. Moura Budberg, introduced by Isaiah Berlin, <date when="1956-00-00">1956</date>, pp. 61, 89).</p>
<p>Herzen and Carlyle&#x2019;s mutual interest lay in their scorn for the falsities they saw in the status quo and their wish to expose them as pungently as possible. Herzen tended to anarchy, and he rightly saw that Carlyle&#x2019;s recent visit to Germany was to seek a basis for his stubborn belief in &#x201C;obedience,&#x201C; which went back at least as far as <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>) when he had praised the Russians for &#x201C;drilling&#x201C; their people into civilization (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 10:158, 168). This was still held against Carlyle in <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date> by Turgenev, who had come to his writings through Herzen, and who also read and appreciated Carlyle, while regretting his admiration for heroes who compelled obedience. It was something already noticed in lengthy reviews in France (see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511117-TC-FB-01"><sic>26:234</sic><corr>TC to FB, <date when="1851-11-17">17 Nov. 1851</date></corr></ref>) which, unlike most English comment, reached beyond the barrier of Carlyle&#x2019;s vehement style to the substance of what he was saying about government, perhaps because more relevant to France than England.</p>
<p>Herzen&#x2019;s seeking out Carlyle alerts us to the latter&#x2019;s attraction for exiled revolutionaries. He was not complacent but vital, ready to listen, talk, and argue. They had seen society overturned, and he agreed that change was possible and even essential. Open to European ideas, unaffected by English insularity, and sceptical of schemes for reforming human nature, he had obviously relived <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> in writing it. He could share Herzen&#x2019;s horror at the brutal suppression of the people&#x2019;s revolutions in France and Italy in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>, while accepting their reality; and he was at least aware that Louis Napoleon kept effective control after his coup only by firm suppression. Both men were sceptical about German and French political leaders of whatever kind.</p>
<p>Their extremism, exaggerated rhetoric, and biting intelligence meant that Carlyle enjoyed his stimulating encounters with Herzen&#x2019;s work or in person far more, for example, than the tedious company of Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s pro-imperial French associates, such as &#x201C;Thiers and the two <hi rend="italic">inevitables</hi> ([Prosper] Merim&#xE9;e and [Leon de] Laborde&#x201C; in Paris late in <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>, whom he found &#x201C;utterly barren&#x201C; and &#x201C;not interesting&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Last Words</hi> 172, 187). Thiers&#x2019; talents <pb id="pg-27-xiv" n="27:xiv"/>were &#x201C;small and contemptible&#x201C;; though it was to the general amusement of fellow-diners that Carlyle seriously told him that Britain itself might end up with a Louis Napoleon, all idea of a &#x201C;Constitution&#x201C; now &#x201C;coming to an end&#x201C; (TC to JAC, <date when="1852-02-23">23 Feb.</date>). Right or wrong, Carlyle and Herzen thought in fundamentals.</p>
<p>They did not forget each other though it is unlikely that they met again. But for a moment we see Carlyle encountering a mind of equal brilliance and tenacity. Herzen continued to send his books to Carlyle, as we find from a copy (now in Carlyle&#x2019;s House, 24 Cheyne Row) of his edition with an introduction of the <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires de l&#x2019;Imperatrice Catherine II. Ecrite par elle-m&#xEA;me</hi> (London, <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>). We know that Carlyle enjoyed it, the copy is heavily marked, and he praised it in <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18:428) as &#x201C;worth all the other&#x201C; books about Catherine, &#x201C;if it is knowledge of Catherine that you are seeking.&#x201C;</p>
<p>The letters of <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date> show how he was steadily drawn to Frederick. All year they express his restless anxiety about his next and possibly last work. Always uneasy between larger projects, we see him circling the new subject as he is drawn into the maelstrom of European history. Not that he admitted any certainty about it at first. He found a strong appeal in Frederick&#x2019;s character which he saw as in his own image, exerting repulsion as well as attraction. The <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date> letters show his first impressions of an actual Germany in company with Joseph Neuberg, and the approach to this major work, as well as the preparatory collection of books about Frederick which were eventually given to Harvard. Together or separately they show much more clearly than before the genesis of Carlyle&#x2019;s new work, its nature, and extremely practical approach to history. <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> can spark off interesting, and often misleading, ideas about Carlyle and history; but in this present edition we cannot ignore the way that it offers the possibility of an almost complete record of how <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> was conceived and written.</p>
<p>Carlyle&#x2019;s book collecting was under way before he set out for Germany at the end of <date when="1852-08-00">August</date>, and it went on throughout the writing of <hi rend="italic">Frederick;</hi> yet the main thrust began in <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date> with Neuberg&#x2019;s help. Carlyle always liked to have the necessary tools to his hand; he largely shunned travel and archival research; and these letters show him making this collection, now in the Houghton Library, Harvard, which was catalogued by William Coolidge Lane, <hi rend="italic">The Carlyle Collection: A Catalogue of Books on Cromwell and Frederick the Great</hi> (Cambridge, Mass., <date when="1888-00-00">1888</date>).</p>
<p>Lane comments that the books are often marked with marginal notes and manuscript additions. Inspection confirms this, but many of the marginalia are brief vertical lines or extremely pithy comments, and the notes Lane mentions are often mere neat indices to help Carlyle find his way about or remember certain passages. All the same there is something to be learned from a closer reading of these interjections and often pointed comments. <pb id="pg-27-xv" n="27:xv"/>They leave the impression that Carlyle was gripped by the fascination of looking at a different kind of world or society, or in correcting older versions of history. As well as this he sometimes noted dramatic elements, and the problems of combining them with exactness or accuracy.</p>
<p>When we are directed to <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> as an awful example of the dangers of Germanic hero-worship, we are often told of Goebbels&#x2019; bringing the bunkered Fuehrer the story of Prussia&#x2019;s defence and miraculous deliverance, presumably from the fifth campaign of the Seven Years&#x2019; War, &#x201C;Frederick is Not to be Overwhelmed&#x201C; (Book 20). Yet we should take more account of the way that Carlyle&#x2019;s approach was invariably retrospective. He made little of the unified nationalist Germany that was just beginning to stir; without time to spare when in Berlin he was exclusively intent on tracking down authentic information and pictures of Frederick, and had hardly a moment to consider the nature of German history. He was not interested in the contemporary scene; and, about two months after his return, he wrote in some despair to his sister Jean: &#x201C;The sight of actual Germany, with its flatsoled puddlings in the slough of nonsense (quite a different kind of nonsense from ours, but not a whit less genuine) has hurt poor <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi> (Freddy) very much in my mind: poor fellow, he too lies deeply buried in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">midden-stank</hi></foreign> even as Cromwell did. &#x2026; In fine why sh<hi rend="italic">d I</hi> torment my domestic soul writing his foreign history? He may go to&#x2014;France for me!&#x201C; (<date when="1852-12-23">23 December</date>). He seeks out decisive drama in the scenes of Frederick&#x2019;s old battles, says that he has no curiosity about anyone in Berlin, and then is quick to write to Lady Harriet that he has already seen two major battlefields, though &#x201C;to get any real <hi rend="italic">sight</hi> of the man and his existence &#x2026; is beyond measure difficult. I must restrict myself to that Problem however&#x201C; (<date when="1852-10-01">1 October</date>). On his travels he evidently felt that he had to learn about the nature of the country, and the cities Frederick besieged, but usually little about his administration unless it could be cast into dramatic form. All this is understandable. Yet he was constantly driven by an intensity in research, going almost as far back as possible, exercised mainly through printed books, and seeking indisputable facts to be discovered, sifted, digested, and arranged.</p>
<p>What day of the week, what week, what month, what year, or what time something happened, and the evidence for it, set down as exactly as possible: that is what concerns him at first. Did it even happen at all? He possessed in perfection the vital editorial tool, of a persistent and almost perpetual scepticism, suspended at peril. This is what dominated Carlyle. Does the advance take place on the right bank or the left? What fools and rogues these historians, editors, biographers, and memoirists are. He knows perfectly well (and don&#x2019;t we all?) that everything depends on their point of view.</p>
<p>His comments are addressed entirely to himself: this is the peculiar feature of his marginalia. When he wrote them, there was not the slightest thought of <pb id="pg-27-xvi" n="27:xvi"/>his casual remarks being embalmed in a great library. Nor was almost anything in the books or written scraps evaluative of Frederick. The lines had probably already begun to set, or they were being drawn in his head with no need for pencilled underlinings. We see the subject growing in his letters. In <date when="1852-02-00">February</date> he is seeking a &#x201C;definite work,&#x201C; but the idea of writing about Frederick seems &#x201C;very idle: what have I, here where I am, to say about &#x2018;the lean drill-serjeant of the world&#x2019;? I do not even grow to love him better: a really mediocre intellect, a hard withered soul; great only in his invincible courage, in his constant unconscious loyalty to truth and fact&#x201C; (<date when="1852-02-16">16 February</date>). His military career is just a &#x201C;Donnybrook Fair&#x201C; (<date when="1852-02-21">21 February</date>). But then Carlyle is caught by the fascination of inquiring research, is led to more book collecting, and ready to talk about strategy with the British commander-in-chief (<date when="1852-04-09">9 April</date>), until by <date when="1852-08-00">August</date> he can say that he must travel to Germany in spite of everything, because it would be &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cowardly</hi>&#x201C; to give up &#x201C;the shadow of an Enterprise&#x201C; which is driving him forward like a &#x201C;kind of bayonet in the back&#x201C; (<date when="1852-08-17">17 August</date>).</p>
<p>Such an interest was not confined to Carlyle. Goethe had frequently referred to Frederick&#x2019;s genius, and Schiller had abandoned plans to write an epic poem on the King&#x2019;s life only because &#x201C;the greatness of the enterprise compared with the uncertainty of its success, were sufficient to deter him&#x201C; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller, Works</hi> 25:119). Carlyle also meant to refute his rival Macaulay, disagreeing with what he saw as his sentimental contrast between the Machievellian king and the virtuous empress Maria Theresa. Yet Carlyle thought that Frederick played the same role in the eighteenth century as Cromwell had in the seventeenth: both failing in their efforts to vanquish chaos and impose order.</p>
<p>At the same time, his chief mentor was the Jewish Joseph Neuberg who was to translate <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> into German and twice led Carlyle through Germany, and for years was to act as his voluntary research assistant (see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521105-TC-JN-01">TC to <sic>Neuberg</sic><corr>JN</corr>, <date when="1852-11-05">5 Nov.</date></ref>; Neuberg to TC, <date when="1852-11-08">8 Nov.</date>, and K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Sketch of Joseph Neuberg,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Annual</hi> 13 [<date when="1992-00-00">1992</date>/<date when="1993-00-00">93</date>]:6&#x2013;7). He saw that Frederick was an ideal choice for Carlyle and wrote that he could be master of the subject, which was neither small nor</p>
<q>unworthy of your pen. The whole 18th Century groups itself round Frederick; he is the Hero of <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, the greatest it could produce. You have frequently treated, with great insight and pitying impartiality, of that same 18th Cent<hi rend="italic">y</hi> with its sins and sorrows and tragic existence. Yet also our modern life with its new-birth, is all rooted in it: German literature, English miraculous Industry, European Democracy: the thought and the work that are in us, about us and before us, all date from then. The Old has all gone to wrecks; laid buried (in Germany) under the ruins of the 30 years&#x2019; War; it had been represented by Kaiser and <pb id="pg-27-xvii" n="27:xvii"/>Pope, and Luther had upset them both. The shattered debris of the Old lay round Frederick (as they had lain round his father and great-grandfather) in depopulated villages, ruined farms, silenced or Hebetated Landstande; in Salzburg-emigrants, Lutheran creeds.&#x2014; Hannoverian Georges, Saxon Augusts, Hessian man-selling electors, Bavarian and Wurtemburg Charles&#x2019;s&#x2014;with some half-thousand mistresses between them&#x2014;bore rule;&#x2014;and but in Austria an honest, noble woman (Maria Theresa) stood at the head of the doomed &#x2018;Old&#x2019;.&#x2014; The voices of Leibnitz, of Lessing, Kant, Goethe were in the air&#x2014;far off as yet; and the French Encyclopedistes had possession of the field as Prophets and Gods. Frederick worked his work in the midst of this; as well as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could I suppose &#x2026; . His own life one must think, suffered sufficiently &#x2026; yet it was heroic and great in its generation.&#x2014; This surely is a theme worth treating of, and one which might occupy you not unpleasantly for some time; staying at all events the craving appetite for work.&#x201C; (<date when="1852-11-08">8 November</date>).</q>
<p>It is the persuasive case for <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi></p>
<p>The marginalia in Carlyle&#x2019;s books leave the impression that he knew he would have to wrestle with contradictions, and allow us to see over his shoulder how the account took shape even before he has gripped his pen to write. We fail to understand this stage in his development unless we see that his inquiries were driven from the first by a search for verifiable truth, insight, understanding, remarkable incidents and startling fact, the selection of which was naturally affected by previous knowledge or prejudices, nationalistic, religious, and personal. The clue of biography is his guide. Dogma and theory are not dismissed, but there is a constant contempt for &#x201C;metaphysics.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Whether we find it in the structure of his works at this time, his confrontational conversational style, or dismissal of theological &#x201C;moonshine&#x201C; in the <hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling</hi>, everything of the kind also reflects a different figure from the writer of the <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>s and early <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>s, though he is usually less ready to discuss his scepticism. He tries to distance himself from hostile reviews of <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi>, though his convictions are only suppressed. A serious assault on his writings by a fervent Methodist, part of the &#x201C;Blockheadism of England,&#x201C; arouses and disturbs him because it assails him for being &#x201C;a tremendous Nightmare descending on this poor man, and the universe, to squelch the Methodism wholly out of him&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18521108-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1852-11-08">8 November</date></ref>). He was as ready to tell G. H. Lewes that he had no time for Comte as to turn on a Tory bishop; and he was prepared to question his own views. Even Goethe trapped at Weimar seemed &#x201C;threatening to become a bigger Lytton Bulwer&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18521001-TC-LA-01">to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1852-10-01">1 October</date></ref>). We are bound to feel uneasy at Carlyle&#x2019;s desperate seriousness and political incorrectness, but it is wrong to domesticate and belittle him.</p>
<p><pb id="lastpage-27-xviii" n="27:xviii"/>Jane Carlyle was part of all these affairs: the first to see Herzen, as interested as Thomas in the disputes thrown up by the life of Sterling, and still writing with an affectionate interest to Sterling&#x2019;s children. She was even ready to think of accompanying her husband to Germany, though alarmed at the idea of doing so with the Ashburtons &#x201C;for a whole year,&#x201C; and with &#x201C;nothing to fall back on under his and my own <hi rend="italic">gloom</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18520506-JWC-HW-01">JWC to HW, [<date when="1852-05-06">6 May</date>?]</ref>). The decision to stay behind was hers, feeling born to be the clerk of works overseeing the builders at Cheyne Row. At this time she has less need of introductory comment than Thomas.</p>
<p>In the year of Mrs. Jellyby and <hi rend="italic">Bleak House</hi>, which so offended J. S. Mill for its slights on women, she was probably indifferent to them. Neither of the Carlyles was drawn to the active feminism of Margaret Fuller, with whose affairs Carlyle was involved by Emerson in negotiations about her private papers taken up with Margaret Gillies (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18520430-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1852-04-30">30 April</date></ref>). But <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date> is a little puzzling as it is also the year when the record of letters from Geraldine Jewsbury stops, which may mean that they had become too outspoken for their editor, Mrs. Ireland.</p>
<p>For Jane Carlyle still had strong resources in herself, as shown in the long and attractive account of her journey to visit the dying Catherine Macready (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18520805-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1852-08-05">5 August</date>]</ref>) or her ebullient response to her old love John Stodart (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18520910-JWC-JRS-01">JWC to JRS, [<date when="1852-09-10">10 September</date>]</ref>). It was also the year of her own slight semi-fictional &#x201C;The Simple Story of My Own First Love,&#x201C; contrasting Thackeray&#x2019;s view of love in <hi rend="italic">Esmond</hi>, with her husband&#x2019;s who seems to have said that Thackeray&#x2019;s was &#x201C;false and damnable.&#x201C; 
Shadows lay over the future, but the year ends with her account of her readiness to meet burglars with cocked pistols and her hero worship of the Duke of Wellington whom she had met at Bath House. She had queued for his lying-in-state &#x201C;at the cost of being crushed for four hours&#x201C; (<date when="1852-12-31">31 Dec.</date>).&#x2014;&#x201C;But to her the charm of such circles,&#x201C; wrote Carlyle, &#x201C;was at all times insignificant; <hi rend="italic">human</hi> was what she looked at, and what she was&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, 105).</p>

<p><bold><date when="1852-00-00">1852</date></bold> <hi rend="italic"><date when="1852-01-00">January</date>.</hi> TC and JWC return from the Grange (<date when="1852-01-02">2</date>). JWC soon catches cold and treats it with morphine. TC discusses Clough&#x2019;s difficulties in a letter to Lady Ashburton (<date when="1852-01-10">10</date>). He sends new year&#x2019;s gifts to his mother and family (<date when="1852-01-16">16</date>), and continues to write to Dr. John Carlyle about re-letting Craigenputtoch.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1852-02-00">February</date>.</hi> TC collects German maps and books. He writes at length about the aims of the Poor Law Association (<date when="1852-02-05">5</date>). A new tenant is chosen for Craigenputtoch (<date when="1852-02-09">9</date>). JWC shops with Miss Farrer, visits friends, keeps in touch with the Ashburtons and Lady Sandwich, is called on by the Countess Reichenbach (<date when="1852-02-10">10</date>), and goes with Clough to hear Mazzini lecture (<date when="1852-02-11">11</date>). TC sometimes uses Anthony Sterling&#x2019;s &#x201C;swift racer&#x201C; for exercise; he complains of &#x201C;the idle fallow state of my intellect&#x201C; (<date when="1852-02-12">12</date>), and the burden of letter writing; and he rejects the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi>&#x2019; request for a daguerreotype and autobiographical notes. He tries to help his nephew James find employment (<date when="1852-02-14">14</date>). He tells Lady Ashburton that he still cannot decide whether to write about Frederick (<date when="1852-02-16">16</date>), but goes on buying books on German history. The Carlyles dine with Edward Ellice and meet Thiers (<date when="1852-02-20">20</date>). The new conservative administration comes in.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1852-03-00">March</date>.</hi> In thanking Neuberg for maps and asking for more books and information TC returns for almost the first time to the idea of a visit to Germany (<date when="1852-03-01">1</date>). The Carlyles go with G. H. Lewes to see one of his plays (<date when="1852-03-05">5</date>). TC acknowledges Browning&#x2019;s study of Shelley, and reads Emerson&#x2019;s memoirs of Margaret Fuller (<date when="1852-03-08">8</date>). Their servant Anne falls ill and substitutes need to be found. TC refuses an invitation to Manchester from the Poor Law Association (<date when="1852-03-13">13</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1852-04-00">April</date>.</hi> TC complains of lumbago. The household is still upset by Anne&#x2019;s illness. He dines at Bath House (<date when="1852-04-06">6</date>), and at the Milneses&#x2019; (<date when="1852-04-07">7</date>), where he meets Lord Palmerston. Lord Ashburton offers TC money for a benevolent purpose. TC rides regularly, visits Addiscombe, and continues collecting maps and books on Germany. Anne returns (<date when="1852-04-20">20</date>). John Cochrane&#x2019;s illness involves TC in searching for a new Librarian for the London Library.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1852-05-00">May</date>.</hi> Though suffering from flu, TC supports John Chapman in his campaign for &#x201C;free trade&#x201C; in books. Cochrane dies (<date when="1852-05-04">4</date>). TC sends Chorley&#x2019;s fair copy of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> MSS to John Forster. He refuses to attend a meeting about &#x201C;industrial <pb id="pg-27-xxvi" n="27:xxvi"/>literature&#x201C; organised by the Society of Arts, but leads a rousing campaign against Gladstone&#x2019;s attempt to foist his Neapolitan prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;, James Lacaita, on the London Library in place of Cochrane. TC tells Emerson that he has secured some of Margaret Fuller&#x2019;s confidential papers left with her friend Margaret Gillies, but that there are still difficulties in getting her to agree to part with them altogether (<date when="1852-05-14">14</date>). The Carlyles go to Addiscombe (<date when="1852-05-19">19</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-05-25">25</date>). JWC invites Kate Sterling, who is forbidden to accept by her uncle. JWC attends a grand Ball at Bath House (<date when="1852-05-29">29</date>). Neuberg still helps with German books; TC thinks it more likely that he will go to Germany; and they take up matters raised by Neuberg&#x2019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> (<date when="1852-05-31">31</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1852-06-00">June</date>.</hi> TC openly mentions to Varnhagen von Ense the &#x201C;project&#x201C; of visiting Germany with JWC, and asks for information and advice (<date when="1852-06-06">6</date>). W. B. Donne is appointed at the London Library (<date when="1852-06-12">12</date>). By the middle of the month TC reports that he is now working hard. He meets the Duke of Holstein-Augustenberg at Bath House (<date when="1852-06-18">18</date>), sees Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> performed in German at the St. James&#x2019;s Theatre (<date when="1852-06-22">22</date>), and tells Emerson that he can now send Margaret Fuller&#x2019;s papers.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1852-07-00">July</date>.</hi> Major changes at 5 Cheyne Row begin after a 31-year lease is signed (<date when="1852-07-04">4</date>). The builders begin in the drawing room (<date when="1852-07-05">5</date>), and TC moves upstairs to work in the middle of a London heat wave. The Carlyles call on the Twisletons to see Cromwell portraits (<date when="1852-07-08">8</date>), but though JWC is offered holidays at Addiscombe or Homberg she wishes to stay at home to supervise the alterations. <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> is published (<date when="1852-07-10">10</date>). TC grows restless; Germany is postponed on Varnhagen von Ense&#x2019;s advice till <date when="1852-08-00">August</date> or later, so he invites himself to stay at Thomas Erskine&#x2019;s at Linlathen (<date when="1852-07-12">12</date>). JWC acquires a cat, practices German with a friend, and sits for a portrait by Penelope Sketchley. She has been involved in a bitter dispute between Sarah Newton and Frank Jewsbury. TC leaves for Scotland by steamship (<date when="1852-07-21">21</date>), arriving at Linlathen (<date when="1852-07-23">23</date>); he visits St. Andrews (<date when="1852-07-29">29</date>), and local towns. At home JWC receives visitors, including Clough, Reichenbach, and Mazzini, continues to engage temporary maids, and cope with builders. She briefly visits Sherborne to see the dying Catherine Macready (<date when="1852-07-27">27</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-07-30">30</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1852-08-00">August</date>.</hi> TC visits Arbroath (<date when="1852-08-05">5</date>), Kirkcaldy (<date when="1852-08-06">6</date>), and Scotsbrig (<date when="1852-08-07">7</date>). After deciding that he and JWC should go to Germany together, JWC declines. She sees John Welsh&#x2019;s balloon ascents from Vauxhall (<date when="1852-08-17">17</date> and <date when="1852-08-26">26</date>), and dines with Mrs. William Fraser (<date when="1852-08-22">22</date>). TC visits members of the family at the Gill and Dumfries, and writes to Neuberg proposing his visit (<date when="1852-08-17">17</date>). He demands a validated passport before leaving from Leith (<date when="1852-08-31">31</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1852-09-00">September</date>.</hi> From Rotterdam TC goes up the Rhine to D&#xfc;sseldorf and Bonn (<date when="1852-09-03">3</date>), where he visits libraries; he makes excursions to Rolandseck and Honnef <pb id="lastpage-27-xxvii" n="27:xxvii"/>and meets Arndt at Bonn before leaving (<date when="1852-09-10">10</date>) for Frankfurt and Mainz (<date when="1852-09-13">13</date>), Eisenach, Kassel, Weimar (<date when="1852-09-19">19</date>), Leipzig, Dresden (<date when="1852-09-22">22</date>), and Berlin (<date when="1852-09-30">30</date>). Neuberg is indispensable, but TC suffers from sleeplessness and nervous indigestion. He is occupied with art galleries and libraries, though visits widely and tries to visualize Frederick&#x2019;s campaigns and locate portraits. Meanwhile JWC battles with builders and decorators, with a break at Addiscombe (<date when="1852-09-04">4</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-09-06">6</date>). She hears of Dr. John Carlyle&#x2019;s engagement (<date when="1852-09-07">7</date>). She takes the MS of Jewsbury&#x2019;s latest novel to a publisher (<date when="1852-09-10">10</date>). In spite of builders, JWC entertains Herzen with Saffi, Reichenbach, Brookfield, and Erasmus Darwin (<date when="1852-09-11">11</date>). Wellington dies (<date when="1852-09-14">14</date>); Catherine Macready dies (<date when="1852-09-18">18</date>). JWC, exhausted, takes overnight lodgings to escape bugs and the smell of paint.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1852-10-00">October</date>.</hi> TC recommends David Masson for a chair at University College, London (<date when="1852-10-01">1</date>). Burglars attack Cheyne Row while JWC is asleep in lodgings (<date when="1852-10-06">6</date>). After a busy social round in Berlin, TC leaves for home (<date when="1852-10-09">9</date>), reaching Ostend and London (<date when="1852-10-12">12</date>), where the builders have not finished, and so the Carlyles leave for the Grange (<date when="1852-10-15">15</date>). TC recuperates, while JWC worries about the house, where the painters finish at last (<date when="1852-10-23">23</date>), and she returns to deal with cleaning (<date when="1852-10-29">29</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1852-11-00">November</date>.</hi> After the visit to the Grange TC rejoins JWC. John Carlyle is married in Moffat (<date when="1852-11-02">2</date>). He takes TC to meet his wife at the railway station on their way through London (<date when="1852-11-05">5</date>). More books come from Germany, but TC is deeply depressed though tries to settle. Wellington lies in state at the Royal Chelsea Hospital, and the Carlyles watch his funeral procession from Bath House (<date when="1852-11-18">18</date>). John M&#x2019;Diarmid dies at Dumfries (<date when="1852-11-18">18</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1852-12-00">December</date>.</hi> TC has rheumatism, Neuberg is back, Disraeli&#x2019;s budget is defeated, and the Derby administration falls (<date when="1852-12-17">17</date>). Rebuilding at 5 Cheyne Row seems finished. Neuberg settles in London, partly to be near the Carlyles. TC arranges for prints from Germany for Lady Ashburton (<date when="1852-12-21">21</date>). On Christmas day, Brookfield and John Welsh dine with the Carlyles; and, next day, Neuberg is given a copy of the new fourth edition of <hi rend="italic">Heroes.</hi> TC says he still does not know whether to write Frederick&#x2019;s life and tells his mother of his relief at six weeks&#x2019; relative silence and &#x201C;perfect seclusion of mind&#x201C; since his return home (<date when="1852-12-31">31</date>).</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We got safe home yesterday afternoon,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the Grange, the Ashburtons&#x2019; stately home nr. Winchester, Hants., where the Carlyles had spent most of <date when="1851-12-00">Dec.</date></note> and I can wish you all a happy Newyear from our own hearth again, which latter is a very pleasant accompanying circumstance. The little Dog Nero stood on his hind legs, full of exuberant joy, to receive us; and for me too there has been no such pleasant day for the last three weeks! Not that we had not many things to be interested in, to be glad of and proud of, in the scene where we were: but the environment and all its arrangements suited and always suits me so ill, I require to be fairly <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of it before I can clearly taste what was really useful and worthy in it. Heigho! It seems to me the saddest of all lives,&#x2014;and very many lives are sad enough in this epoch of the world! But it is ending, it will not continue long; that is something. Coming to the Railway Station, we met some 20 or 30 stout young men of those parts roaming about, having fallen out of work, and farther on, about Woking region, are 20 or 30 thousand acres of waste land, in good climate, on dry bottom, the whole of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are clearly reclaimable on good terms. But the rulers of the world hunt foxes, make bursts of parliamentary eloquence:&#x2014;how <hi rend="italic">can</hi> it ever come to good, all this!&#x2014; &#x2014; Thackeray and his two girls were with us:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Recovering from the Brookfield crisis (see <ref target="volume-26/ed-26-introduction"><sic>26:xiii</sic><corr>26:introduction</corr></ref>) and in the course of writing <hi rend="italic">Henry Esmond</hi>.</note> a sad tar-barrel of pure and impure combustibles, this Th<hi rend="italic">y.</hi>, now blazing off in a really ominous way! I had never seen him so well before. There is a great deal of talent in him, a great deal of sensibility,&#x2014;irritability, sensuality, vanity without limit;&#x2014;and nothing or little but sentimentalism and playacterism to guide it all with: not a good or well-found ship in such waters on such a voyage. In the Train we came upon Milnes and his Wife, just returning from <hi rend="italic">Palmerston&#x2019;s</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The country home, Broadlands, Hants., nr.

<salute>Dear Marshall,</salute>
<p>I will wish you, in Scotch and human fashion, &#x201C;a right happy new year, and many of them&#x201C;: your Letter at this season gives me opportunity of uttering such a sentiment, which lay otherwise alive tho&#x2019; in the mute state, and did not owe its being to this present cause of its vocality. His Royal Highness,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl Friedrich (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>); grand duke of Saxe Weimar.</note> who is pleased to favour me with such a request, may be well assured I will omit no opportunity that may occur of recommending Weimar as a place for learning German. That surely is a character which it still well merits, and may still long merit. But I much fear, the going out of so many irreplaceable spiritual luminaries may have permanently dimmed it, nevertheless, in the fancy of the young generation; and that the tide of English Wandering, which is a most capricious idle frothy tide, subject to something much madder even than the Moon, may have, for a long while to come, set obstinately elsewhitherward. Alas, there are now no Goethe and Schiller, were a pilgrim never so wise; there are only the graves and haunts of Goethe and Schiller, which are a far other affair for him! And very few pilgrims are <hi rend="italic">wise;</hi> most pilgrims are nearly without wisdom altogether, and will run to Homburg, to Kissingen, to Manheim, to Berlin, Coblentz, Katzenwellenbogen,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The countryside between Darmstadt and Frankfurt-am-Main.</note>&#x2014;attracted by the Cooks of Inns, by the conveniences of Steam carriage, by one knows not, and they know not, what,&#x2014;in a very mad manner indeed! Once more, let it be considered certain that if I can do anything for Captain Horrocks,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><corr>Although &#x201C;Unidentified&#x201C; at <hi rend="italic">CL</hi> 27:2, Michael Demy-Geroe points out in a comment to the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi> Feedback Page submitted on 8 Aug. 2009 that TC is referring to Capt. Charles Horrocks; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560131-TC-JWP-01">TC to [JWP], <date when="1856-01-31">31 Jan. 1856</date></ref>.</corr> </note> and for the dear little City of Weimar, it shall faithfully, on all opportunities, be done.</p>
<p>Your Russian Tour, since you are able to travel, and stand <hi rend="italic">bugs</hi> and dirty <pb id="pg-27-3" n="27:3"/>beds, and other wants and sufferings, seems to me extremely enviable. Of all the countries in the world Russia is now the one I have the most curiosity about: evidently a grand country, peer of Saxondom and Yankeedoodledoodom, and with a great destiny ahead of it,&#x2014;to which, even <hi rend="italic">without</hi> &#x201C;liberty of the press&#x201C; (singular to say), it is rapidly, and grandly in the view of all men, advancing by inevitable law.

<salute>Dear Mr Erskine,</salute>
<p>There was published, about ten years ago, by the Maitland Club, a volume containing all the Authentic notices and documents about our Scotch Hero <hi rend="italic">Wallace;</hi> the Author&#x2019;s name I have lost, but he has been recommended to me as careful and exact:&#x2014;in fine, I am desirous to have a reading of this little volume of his.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Documents Illustrative of Sir William Wallace, His Life and Times</hi>, ed. Joseph Stevenson (Glasgow, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>). The Maitland Club was founded <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date> to publish works on Scottish literature and antiquities. Sir William Wallace (<date when="1272-00-00">1272</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1305-00-00">1305</date>), patriot.</note> As <hi rend="italic">Maitland-Club</hi> Books are not easily accessible here, my thoughts have reverted to your friend Mackenzie,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Mackenzie (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>), third son of Henry Mackenzie (<date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), author of the popular novel <hi rend="italic">The Man of Feeling</hi> (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>).

At all events, as you are now near me, I decide to try this first, if you can sanction me. And that is the purport of my writing at present.&#x2014; If you foresee that Mr Mackenzie may have objections, or that there are objections anywhere,&#x2014;I need not say in that case, Do nothing. But if you foresee otherwise, then&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here is Jenny&#x2019;s Letter, which I have had for two days; I will not send it back to you without a word from myself, hurried as I am, to say that all is still in the old way with us here. Poor little Jenny appears to be getting on very well in her new home: let us hope, after this first fit of illness, she may have got used to the climate, and have her health too, which seems the only thing needed to make her very happy where she is. As she says nothing or <pb id="pg-27-7" n="27:7"/>almost nothing about that point, I conclude she feels quite stout again. Certainly she seems to have made a great improvement in her way of life by the change: her letters have a cheerfulness and expansion of humour which they never shewed before in any of her former situations. Indeed I suppose she was very unhappy at Dumfries, poor little thing, and never knew any contentment there. We have got established in the old train here, and are going on as softly as possible. Jane has left all her colds at The Grange; and roves out, as heretofore, daily with the little dog at her heel;&#x2014;only she seems to have given up the walk <hi rend="italic">before</hi> breakfast, which for her is perhaps &#x201C;quite as well.&#x201C; As to me I run out every morning, cooled to the bone with bathing, and walk vigorously till I recover heat; the first thing each day: it is far from agreeable, but I rather find it wholesome (or think I do), and it has partly the air of <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi> too which recommends it. I am reading books as before; very uncertain yet when or how I shall get a stroke at writing again! I must try, try, and be at once patient and diligent. A poor fellow called Eliot Warburton,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bartholomew Elliot George (usually known as Eliot) Warburton, a miscellaneous writer, was to have arranged an understanding for the Atlantic &#x26; Pacific Junction Co. with the Indians of the Isthmus of Darien (now Panama) while exploring it. He left Southampton <date when="1852-01-02">2 Jan.</date>, on the maiden voyage of the <hi rend="italic">Amazon</hi>, but died on the burning deck when the ship caught fire, <date when="1852-01-04">4 Jan.</date> He was survived by his widow, Matilda Jane, b. Grove (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>), and their sons; see <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1852-01-08">8 Jan.</date></note> a Writer of some note, whom I knew a little of, and had a Note from while at The Grange, set off, on the very day of our return, in a steamer called the Amazon for Mexico &#x26;c ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> which I suppose he meant to make a Book: alas, news is already here that the Steamer took fire, near the Scilly Islands, and that of 160 souls only 21 escaped, of whom he is not one! His poor widow and children (in an expensive house and without resource) have a terrible sorrow in these days!&#x2014;Twistleton<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Turner Boyd Twisleton (always wrongly spelled Twistleton by TC), a close friend of the Carlyles.</note> (whom the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> knows) told us this news yesternight, having come down for an hour or two,&#x2014;not quite, bad company he.

I know not what you did to her that monday morning; but she has looked much <hi rend="italic">happier</hi> ever since, and is at her ease beside me; a result which I cannot but bless, and rejoice at, for her sake and for mine. You are indisputably an astonishing woman; and have a gift like no other alive!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I forwarded the letter to Clough,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Hugh Clough, who had resigned as principal of University Hall, London, expecting the appointment to the chair of classics at University College, Sydney, Australia. He had just heard that someone else had been chosen, and was looking for another position. About this time Erasmus Darwin wrote to Fanny Wedgwood of meeting the Carlyles, when &#x201C;Thomas seems to me to have become all of a sudden an old man so gray and quiet. I hope he has found some happy subject to write about &#x2026; . He talked with the greatest composure of Clough starving a little &#x26; fighting his way as a literary man.&#x201C; TC and Clough had been discussing Clough&#x2019;s literary plans. (See K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Froude&#x2019;s Revenge, or the Carlyles and Erasmus A. Darwin,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Essays and Studies, <date when="1978-00-00">1978</date></hi>, ed. W. W. Robson [<date when="1978-00-00">1978</date>] 87).</note> to his old address at least, whence it will soon reach him, and be a glad word when it arrives. I had seen him here two days before, and heard of his fortune,&#x2014;which one loves not to reckon a <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>fortune for such a man; tho&#x2019;, I understand, he is very poor, and will have his own tuggings in the wrestle with Destiny. But a tough man is not the worse for that; nay the better, if he can stand to it. &#x201C;Under <hi rend="italic">gold</hi> thrones,&#x201C; says Richter, &#x201C;how many giant souls lie pressed to death!&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See &#x201C;Jean Paul Friedrich Richter,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 27:122.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014;Twistleton was here one ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, full of goodhumour, thinnish practical speculation, and very rotatory in his gestures; he is now to the country (whitherward not said) for a month; and we see him no more till the new season.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>There is nothing in M&#x2019;Queen&#x2019;s offer to alter the decision I had already arrived at.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About letting Craigenputtoch.</note> If the Farm, in the opinion of good judges, is &#xa3;20 below the usual rate of the country (or even decisively too low at all), of course we must attempt to get the due rent for it, or convince ourselves that we cannot get it.&#x2014; Let Mr Adamson, therefore, <hi rend="italic">advertise</hi> at once, and with vigour, in all the Newspapers, as I suppose there is now no time to be lost.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The advert. appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1852-01-20">20 Jan.</date> and later, saying that it was to be let for fifteen years from Whitsunday: 767 acres with a suitable &#x201C;Farm Steading,&#x201C; and a good &#x201C;Two-Storey <hi rend="italic">Dwelling House</hi>,&#x201C; about 13 mi. from Dumfries with good roads in all directions.</note></p>
<p>M&#x2019;Queen&#x2019;s offer about the House does not seem very reasonable: it was always reckoned that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had the House (which is quite superfluous for the uses of the Farm) without rent, and that the value of the Field was about &#xa3;10, more or less. The Game being worth &#xa3;5 or so, he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> appear at this rate to <pb id="pg-27-10" n="27:10"/>enjoy the Farm for a real rent of &#xa3;155 minus the Field. However, as there is little or no likelihood of our ever coming actually to want the House, his offers in that respect may be considered <hi rend="italic">theoretical</hi> rather than practical, and cannot be of much importance.</p>
<p>The dubious point to me is, whether there is now <hi rend="italic">time</hi> for a fair trial of advertising? But as the option is still left me in Mr Adamson&#x2019;s Letter, I consider there still must be, as I am ignorant otherwise.</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have written on another sheet a Letter for showing to Adamson; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, if you mean to act on that line of operations, ought to be despatched immediately. But is not Candlemas (<date when="1852-02-02">2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>) the <hi rend="italic">final</hi> term; which leaves us barely 2 weeks for advertising, or perhaps in certain of the Newspapers only one? If that is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the case, and Jamie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle, TC&#x2019;s youngest brother.</note> still persists in his opinion about the rent of the place (reckoning in its &#x201C;remoteness of situation&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c), then go ahead at once,&#x2014;and let the issue be what it will: we shall have <hi rend="italic">done our best;</hi> and that is properly the only point in the least essential.</p>
<p>But on the whole, I must as good as altogether refer myself (according to what I said already) to Jamie&#x2019;s good judgment and yours; I pray you again therefore to act for me, as you would for yourselves; in my present position outward and inward I can do nothing so wise as invite Jamie to lend me his experience and practical sense in the matter, and to walk by that.&#x2014; Bell,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Bell.</note> of course, were quite as good a tenant for me as M&#x2019;Queen; and I see no reason why M&#x2019;Queen ag<hi rend="italic">t him</hi> sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have &#xa3;10 favour shown him, as I originally proposed ag<hi rend="italic">t unknown</hi> competition. In fact I know nothing ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> this M&#x2019;Queen; have heard only that he is very timid, stingy, and <hi rend="italic">able</hi> to pay what he bargains for. For the rest, as there is no time to lose, do not embarras<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> yourself with <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> to me (when that is embarrassing), but <hi rend="italic">act</hi> at once when your mind is clear, and I will sanction.&#x2014; Did Jamie and you look at all at the woods? I could like they were put in some way of welldoing, if they are not already so. If anything seem doable in that respect, pray do it. I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> also willingly encourage <pb id="pg-27-11" n="27:11"/>any <hi rend="italic">draining</hi> or otherwise improving man: perhaps for that object Bell is a likelier person than M&#x2019;Queen?&#x2014; In short, my dear Brother, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have very little knowledge about the affair at all, and must depend upon Jamie&#x2019;s chiefly, as collected, sifted, and translated into action by yourself: all that I do decidedly feel or know about the matter has now, I think, been imparted to you. And so we will leave the negociation in your hands; and wish a right happy issue to it. <hi rend="italic">Any</hi> reasonable issue, and fair end to what is so foreign an affair, will be very welcome to me.</p>
<p>The very day I wrote to my Mother, poor Jane caught a cold, and could not rise next morning. Yesterday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> she decided on <hi rend="italic">morphine</hi> (ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> midnight) and despatched me to bed; in about half an hour, the morphine took away every trace of face-ache and other pain, in fact <hi rend="italic">ended</hi> the cold,&#x2014;but she did not withal sleep one wink; and so she still lies, without suffering, but giddy when she attempts to get up. We have hard frost this morning, and the wind gone. Decidedly cold, tho&#x2019; the sun is shining. I hope nevertheless Jane will, with care, find herself <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> of her bad enemy at this price.</p>
<p>Tonight I am to go and dine with Tho<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Erskine who is living at 44. Lowndes Street<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Belgravia. Erskine wrote, <date when="1852-02-18">18 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;There is something marvellous in the difference of the lots appointed to different persons.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>By this same post there comes a Copy of a poor little Book I have lately published; which I beg you to accept (without words) as a mute token of my loyalty. &#x201C;Without words,&#x201C; I say; for is not Rowland Hill&#x2019;s conveyance,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The post office directed by Rowland Hill.</note> with this <hi rend="italic">double</hi> bond upon it, sure; and does not silence say better all that can be said in such a case?

Landor wrote John Forster not long after receiving the book: &#x201C;I am a great advocate for hero-worship; and when you have looked closely into Carlyle, you may discover him to be quite as much of a hero as Cromwell&#x201C; (J. Forster, <hi rend="italic">W. S. Landor: A Biography</hi> [<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>] 2:465).</note></p>
<p>I have never seen you since that morning from the top of the Omnibus, while you did gallantly the last duties of hospitality to my poor carpetbag and me, in a way memorable enough; and waved me your good-b&#x2019;ye,&#x2014;leaving an impression on me not to be effaced, which I reckon among my possessions henceforth.

<p>Many thanks to you for running over so promptly to Dumfries for me. May your shadow never be less!&#x2014; We have not the <hi rend="italic">Plan</hi> here, but believe it to be with Mr Stewart at Gillenbie;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Hope Stewart of Gillenbie Rig Farm, nr.

I have written to Adamson to say so.&#x2014; The whole matter seems now to be in a good train; and I will hope you will carry it victoriously to an issue, you and A<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, which will be a real favour to me indeed.</p>
<p>Jane has got out of her cold again; at least so far as to come down stairs: but she is still very weakly;&#x2014;and the weather is one element of mud and damp darkness; continual dripping or pouring wet these two days: I went to Erskine&#x2019;s on Saturday night, all wrapt ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> hard frost; at my issuing out again, it was spitting wet with thaw wind, and so it has ever since continued!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Yesternight I had the honour to receive a Copy of your new Book;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Neues Leben, Eine Erzahlung</hi>, 3 vols. (Mannheim, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>). B&#xF6;lte wrote to Varnhagen from Dresden, <date when="1852-02-01">1 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Auerbach sent his &#x2018;New Life&#x2019; to Carlyle and received a courteous letter of thanks from him in reply&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 92, trans.).</note> for which kindness, please to accept from me many thanks. With my earliest <pb id="pg-27-14" n="27:14"/>leisure I mean to treat myself to the perusal of this Work, and thereby obtain a little more acquaintance with your way of thinking and deliberating, which has already its fair share of admirers in these parts.</p>
<p>It is probable the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> will, of their own accord, proceed to review the Book;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neither did.</note> nor will I omit any opportunity that may occur of encouraging them in such a purpose: but I ought to add that, for many years past, I have no kind of concern with any review or newspaper; and indeed rather study to keep myself at a distance from that department of our affairs.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Yesternight, two or three days after your kind Note of announcement, the Book itself arrived, all safe and right: for which I send you, in the meanwhile, many thanks and acknowledg[m]ents.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> I know not what the Post-Office people could have meant by &#x201C;3 /&#x201C;: <hi rend="italic">sixpence a pound</hi> is their rate for Books, wrapt as Books, in these days; and this volume weighs under 3 lb. However, we shall see, when once I have got it read, and am ready to return it: for the present, it is all right,&#x2014;no time lost, as I was, and am still to be for a while, fully occupied otherwise.</p>
<p>The Book, I fear, is very dark; <hi rend="italic">light</hi> about the veritable living William Wallace not to be expected from it, more than sunbeams are from cucumbers! This &#x201C;Stevenson&#x201C; who edits gives me a cold shudder: a poor man already known to me, of plausible but imbecil quality, fatal as a guide in such enterprises.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Stevenson (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26434"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), archivist and historian who had been in the MSS dept. of the British Museum Lib. <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>, when TC may have known him, was vicar of Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">62</date>, when he became a Roman Catholic.</note> Alas, imbecil editing abounds in all such things;&#x2014;and the general <pb id="pg-27-15" n="27:15"/>empire of <hi rend="italic">stupidity</hi> (&#x201C;not to be conquered by the very gods,&#x201C; says Schiller)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Die Jungfrau von Orleans</hi> 3.6; cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360429-TC-RWE-01"><sic>8:336</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1836-04-29">29 April 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> presses hard upon &#x201C;Heroes&#x201C; and some other persons! However, as a pious Scotchman I will faithfully try, were my hands once free; one grudges much to surrender such a Fact as Wallace to the Nightmares,&#x2014;bad luck to them and their ministering Agents in this world!</p>
<p>I dined with Erskine on Saturday last, and had a few hours of old Scotch and human interests; a pleasant variety in this vortex of things. Poor Mrs Paterson is very weakly and unwell, but not now considered to be in danger; which is a happy improvement from what was. Erskine himself is certainly, as you say, one of the gentlest and friendliest clear souls that ever lived under the Sun: a truly <hi rend="italic">pious</hi>man, whose reverence for God extends itself as brotherly regard to all that God has made,&#x2014;true loyal respect for whatsoever good quality, under whatever obstructions and conditions, is to be found in any man or thing. I am never weary of admiring his tolerance for myself in particular; and often think he ought to excommunicate me,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; he does not, nor will, I believe. Long life to so excellent a brother man!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have infinite continual rumours here, on the political side, foreign and domestic, for such as care to listen to them. Some are even for an invasion by the French before long. I have not yet taken to practice with the long rifle, for my own part;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rifle clubs were being organized all over the country. Many of TC&#x2019;s friends were eager participants. Coventry Patmore, for example, wrote of his efforts to enlist volunteers: he recruited colleagues at the British Museum and tried &#x201C;to obtain members enough to justify us in asking permission of the Government to drill. &#x2026; I asked Alfred Tennyson to help, and he took up the matter ardently, giving a handsome donation and writing and publishing <supplied>[seven poems, such as &#x2018;Rifle Clubs!!!&#x2019; and &#x2018;Britons, Guard Your Own&#x2019;]</supplied>. James Spedding and others helped with money. We called a meeting, and soon found ourselves able to make up a thousand men. &#x2026; I used to go through the drill in Westminster Hall, but soon found it too exhausting for my strength&#x201C; (B. Champneys, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs and Correspondence of Coventry Patmore</hi> [<date when="1900-00-00">1900</date>] 1:71&#x2013;72).</note> and indeed imagine, on the whole, that if the French did come over, they might not get back again so easily,&#x2014;which fact, visible to themselves too, will probably discourage them from <hi rend="italic">trying.</hi> The state of France itself appears to be unenviable enough, in the meanwhile: soldiers fast &#x201C;demoralizing,&#x201C; rolling <hi rend="italic">drunk</hi> about the streets, insolently elbowing the passengers (so says a letter of this morning); and already several &#x201C;thousands,&#x201C; many <hi rend="italic">without</hi> trial of any kind, on their road to the Tropical swamps.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., transported to Cayenne, French Guiana.</note> But on the whole, what could be expected? France is caught suddenly as in a universal rat-trap; and, I must say, the rat-catcher seems worthy of the job and of his rats! Unless France have far more wisdom in it than one <hi rend="italic">sees</hi> of late years, it seems galloping towards destruction. But let us hope nevertheless.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-16" n="27:16"/>I did call once at Doune Terrace, and hope, some time to do it again.&#x2014; The Book shall be well taken care of.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours sincerely</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I sent you a small Book, the <hi rend="italic">Life of Elliott</hi>, which I hope may amuse you for a few hours in your winter imprisonment. I suppose you are wise to keep your bed mainly, and I ought not to repine at thinking of you there; I will entreat you to take all care of yourself, for all our sakes;&#x2014;and let us all be thankful for what blessings we have left to us! I know you will be patient, hopeful and pious-minded, dear Mother, wherever you be; and that certainly is a lasting comfort to me, which nothing can take away.&#x2014; We have better weather now today again, after a week of the rainiest muddiest desolation you could well conceive as coming from the elements. They sweep the streets diligently by their &#x201C;pauper labour&#x201C; here; but the <hi rend="italic">dirt</hi> that comes out of these muggy sooty rains here is a thing beyond belief; and one is right glad to see the face of the sun again. Perhaps with you the bad weather still continues: but one&#x2019;s imagination is flattered by the clear sky, and one hopes you too may be getting good of it.</p>
<p>Enclosed here is a Draught for &#xa3;8, which is in John&#x2019;s name, and for which he will give you the cash,&#x2014;to be disposed of as follows, if you please. First a five pound for yourself, to buy something, whatever it may be, that you like, or think will be of any use or pleasure to you at the New Year; that is the main part of the Affair. The remaining 3 sovereigns I will beg you to give to Isabella<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle who regularly sent local produce to Cheyne Row.</note> for me, with many kind wishes, &#x26; thanks to her for all her goodness and attention at all times: I meant to write to her myself but she will excuse me in this hurry. It will gratify her also to say that the Butter, this year was really admirable, now that we are fairly got into it. The <hi rend="italic">broken</hi> Pitcher had a something of wrong quality, a kind of under-taste (&#x201C;taste of the knife,&#x201C; some call it), perceptible to finer palates, for a while;&#x2014;the breaking of the Pitcher, I suppose, had been the reason;&#x2014;but that is now altogether gone, and it is all perfectly right and excellent. And so we will go on, and diligently <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> it; which is the only other duty now to be done to it. We have almost given up <hi rend="italic">porridge</hi> in the evenings this good while; but Jane sometimes gives us a treat of oatcakes to cheese, which are a great dainty; and whenever <hi rend="italic">porridge</hi> is wanted, here it can be had, of proper quality,&#x2014;when we will take the trouble to attend <pb id="pg-27-17" n="27:17"/>to the making of it.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have Jamie&#x2019;s Book (<hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>) ready here, and Mary&#x2019;s;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle and Mary Austin.</note> and only wait for some good opportunity of sending them. Let this be known, with my New Years wishes.</p>
<p>Jane has got pretty well out of her cold, but is still rather tender and feckless in the dirty weather;&#x2014;ill off for sleep chiefly. She went out yesterday in the Omnibus, during our blink of dry weather, and will likely do the same today.</p>
<p>When you, and the rest that care for it, have done with the Book on <hi rend="italic">Elliott</hi>, you can send it on to Dumfries where Jean<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aitken.</note> will be glad of it. I send the <hi rend="italic">Critic</hi> direct to her today (tell John),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500207-TC-EC-01"><sic>25:20</sic><corr>TC to EC, <date when="1850-02-07">7 Feb. 1850</date></corr></ref>; TC appears to have been receiving it regularly and sending it on.</note> as I have not <hi rend="italic">written</hi> anything to that quarter this long while; but I will tell her to forward it to Scotsbrig directly:&#x2014;a most small prize when it does come!</p>
<p>All manner of rumours arrive from France, about horrid tyrannies there, banishment to yellow fever and Cayenne of <hi rend="italic">thousands</hi> with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> trial; soldiers <hi rend="italic">drunk</hi> on the streets and elbowing passengers &#x26;c &#x26;c: a dangerous-looking state of things indeed!&#x2014; &#x2014; Bid John write me a word how you all are. <closer><salute>My blessings on you dear Mother.&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<p>Here is Senior&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nassau William Senior.</note> Letter again: many thanks for <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, and many more for the opportunity it gives me. The Letter itself is very good, interesting as a hasty bag of rumours from the seat of war; but the handwriting surely excels in badness all human efforts hitherto! Some of it, names &#x26;c where there is no kind of clue, I was forced to give up, as needing witchcraft:&#x2014;in fact it is atrocious, more like <hi rend="italic">foot</hi>writing than a handwriting; as if the philosopher had done it with a burnt stick between two of his toes.&#x2014; In point of substance too your own dashing Note is far more descriptive of the state of matters: Pretorian guards at 10 francs a-day, Generals put <foreign><hi rend="italic">au secret</hi></foreign> [in solitary confinement], all Journalism stopped, drunk soldiers elbowing the Able editor;&#x2014;this poor Opera-King<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis Napoleon.</note> is in deadly earnest, it would seem; and has surely a terrible job ahead of him! Like a Yankee Captain of a River-Steamer, with his <hi rend="italic">valves</hi> all loaded, everything plugged up, and a roaring fire below: so <hi rend="italic">he</hi> <pb id="pg-27-18" n="27:18"/>sails,&#x2014;defying the explosive powers, for a short season. A very ugly phenomenon; but on the whole I sometimes say, Are not the Destinies, in strange fashion, doing by this poor man the things one often prayed to see done? Stump-oratory <hi rend="italic">has</hi> got a little repression, which it will feel for a long time. I have prayed for that as the beginning of all good results whatsoever; and been used to say that &#x201C;Rhadamanthus&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400417-TC-HMS-01"><sic>12:114</sic><corr>TC to HMS, <date when="1840-04-17">17 April 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> (my own private friend), if he could get the whole body of French Journalists, Parliamentary orators, Book-writers, and Talking Persons, assembled in the Champs-de-Mars, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> peremptorily order them, probably <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, to be silent till they got something wiser, or else die. And behold here, in the most unexpected way, is Rhadamanthus partly <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> it! Let us be thankful; let us quietly take the Christmas Play-shew (a gratis one, and acted as <hi rend="italic">play</hi> never was before,&#x2014;with real thunder, and cannon-firing that means death), and look with sure hope what the catastrophe will be. Weak, vainglorious, somewhat despicable France finds itself suddenly caught as in a universal rat-trap; which is a sad destiny indeed; but I must say, the ratcatcher, the job, and the rats are all worthy of one another! Enough of them, more than enough.</p>
<p>Nothing is passing here, either good or bad, last week,&#x2014;nothing except the inexorable lapse of so many more of our few days, laden or not laden with some fraction of worthy labour into the Eternities,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> laden, I grieve to say, for most part! But at least I keep silent and apart from the jangle of fools and of men generally; and let <hi rend="italic">remorse</hi> get what hold of me it has a right to. Perhaps I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> find my way again by and by; at all events one ought to die seeking it. Under a load fully equal to all my strength, I get along, if not with less sorrow, yet with less contemptibility when well let alone by blockheads, play actors, zanies and bores. For the rest, little other than a lost man&#x2014;Oh Lady, Lady! But you are a brave sunny courageous hoping soul; and the reflex from you (even under these conditions) is infinitely precious to me. Thanks to the gods for all good and beautiful things!&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x2014;Poor Jane has got rid of her cold again; and is now, as she was daily, out with her &#x201C;imaginary truffle-dog,&#x201C;&#x2014;as you defined the glorious Nero to be. By the bye, don&#x2019;t be unkind to that poor old wretch of a truffle-man; I mean, do not let <hi rend="italic">my</hi> foolish impertinent words irritate your royal mind towards him; remember always, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> said nothing, and is where he was. Attend to this, I humbly beseech you, bountiful Lady of the world. And that will do for the old truffle-man; more power to his elbow, poor old being!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I regret Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> did not go as umpire,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; perhaps it is likeliest he could have done no good in the Engineer affair. But Cranworth<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Monsey Rolfe (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24019"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430720-TC-JWC-01"><sic>16:303</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-07-20">20 July 1843</date></corr></ref>), Lord Cranworth, lord justice of the court of appeal in chancery.</note> seems to me <pb id="pg-27-19" n="27:19"/>remarkably shallow, and sticks to the mere <hi rend="italic">skin</hi> of the affair, as if that were the substance of it. The workmen have got the wrong side, I do understand; nevertheless, nevertheless&#x2014;!

My morning walk two<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> cuts off almost an <pb id="pg-27-20" n="27:20"/>hour of every forenoon; and then in the evenings, so liable to interruption otherwise, I am not up in my room here, and have no fire beside my writing-tools. It is like snatching furniture from a conflagration, to get any work done at all! But my Mother&#x2019;s Letter shall take precedence of work, then; whatever is swept into the corner, that shall not be swept if I can help it. The truth is, here as elsewhere one <hi rend="italic">can</hi> write, and even work, if one resolve well to do it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Ham has been cut into; and proves perfectly well kept (<hi rend="italic">new</hi> indeed), and very good eating: there is a large stock of it ahead too,&#x2014;especially with some additional contributions (a <hi rend="italic">half</hi> ham &#x26;c) that have just come from Auchtertool last night:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From JWC&#x2019;s cousin Walter Welsh, minister of Auchtertool, nr. Kirkcaldy.</note>&#x2014;so that it will behove us diligently to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi>, to be a match for the business. Which surely is a fortunate figure of affairs! Isabella&#x2019;s fine Turkey, for which give her many thanks, had to be exchanged for fine fat Fowls here,&#x2014;which bargain it was clear to Jane she drew the <hi rend="italic">shorter</hi> cut;&#x2014;tell Isabella, as neither of <hi rend="italic">us</hi> can eat turkey, she must not rob herself any more in that way. I mentioned the stockings, how excellent they looked; just the colour, grist and size I wanted: I will not break in upon them yet, least of all in this bad splashy weather, but keep them lying till my need is greater. I thank my dear Mother many times. She was always <hi rend="italic">good</hi> to me, and still is. I can hardly look without moistened eyes on this brave lot of stockings, and think of all that has come and gone in that way!</p>
<p>Here is a Letter from the Brother of John Mitchel the Irish Rebel;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Mitchel, who had left Ireland for New York, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>; he had a minor govt. appt., <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>; brother of John Mitchel (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">75</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18828"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Irish nationalist and journalist, transported to Tasmania.</note> which is hardly worth reading, unless the Dr be in good humour, and perhaps smoking his pipe at the time. I do not the least recollect the young man; but sent him a kind of answer for his poor Brother&#x2019;s and Mother&#x2019;s sake.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had met the mother, Mary, b.

I maintained that there was yet hardly the shadow of a probability; and, except of a temporary insult to our coasts, there was not, and could not soon be, even a possibility; and that, on the whole, if we had to bestir ourselves, out of the abominable <hi rend="italic">Hudsonism</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From George Hudson, the &#x201C;Railway King,&#x201C; dishonest promoter of railway shares; see &#x201C;Hudson&#x2019;s Statue,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets, Works</hi> 20:254&#x2013;92.</note> and rotten canting confusion now everywhere prevalent, and fight for ourselves like men or be slaughtered as fat swine, it probably w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a great advantage to us at the end of the account!&#x2014; The Bishop c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be converted to my opinion, all at once; but seemed to take some comfort from it nevertheless.</p>

<salute>Dear Empson,</salute>
<p>Let me write to you about a small matter of what is called business, or what may become such,&#x2014;a very small one.</p>
<p>Scarce two years ago or more, I met, one morning at breakfast, in Dublin, a certain Dr Murray, a big rawboned substantial man (bodily and spiritually), &#x201C;Catholic Professor of Divinity at Maynooth&#x201C;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Patrick Aloysius Murray, prof. of theology at Maynooth College. Gavan Duffy had written TC that Murray &#x201C;wished to become an Edinburgh reviewer&#x201C; and asked Carlyle&#x2019;s help (Duffy 175). Murray contributed to the journal for a short time.</note> with whom, as with a rational <pb id="pg-27-22" n="27:22"/>methodic articulate-speaking creature is possible, I had some pleasant enough tho&#x2019; unimportant conversation about matters in his sphere of things in those parts. Since that, the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> has published successively a couple of Volumes called <hi rend="italic">Irish Annual</hi> or some such name;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Irish Annual Miscellany</hi>, 2 vols. (Dublin <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">51</date>). Two more vols. appeared, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>.</note> concerning which I have seen laudatory notices, with excerpts to vouch, in the Irish Newspapers. The excerpts were forcibly and smoothly written,&#x2014;in a much <hi rend="italic">mitigated</hi> John-of Tuam style,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John MacHale (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17528"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490729-TC-JWC-01"><sic>24:154</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1849-07-29">29 July 1849</date></corr></ref>), archbishop of Tuam, co. Galway, opposed to everything English.</note>&#x2014;or rather they seemed struggling to become a kind of friendly middle-term, or halfway-house of peaceable refection, <hi rend="italic">between</hi> John-of-Tuam and (shall I say?) Samuel-of-Oxford or even Connop-of-St. David&#x2019;s!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Wilberforce; and Connop Thirlwall.</note> In short, the man, as I said, has <hi rend="italic">substantial</hi> faculties of mind, under that Maynooth vesture: a pair of wild hard Irish eyes in his head; a strong deliberate voice, accustomed to grammatical and other measure in its utterance; considerable secret wrath against England, but well veiled almost to invisibility:&#x2014;a huge lump of an &#x201C;educated Ulster Papist&#x201C;; very coarse and plebeian, but also perfectly <hi rend="italic">well washed</hi>, and aware of the rules valid around him. Probably forty years of age;&#x2014;and certainly a yard across the shoulders, and six feet in his stockings.</p>
<p>This Dr Murray, who seems to have become a man of some mark in his own circle, appears now to be contemplating conquests in a wider sphere; and has come up on me, for the second time, in a kind of reflex manner if not in a direct. Yesterday, thro&#x2019; a common Irish acquaintance,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Gavan Duffy; see next letter.</note> I was informed that the Dr aimed so high as writing an Article, &#x201C;on some neutral subject,&#x201C; for the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review;</hi> and I was earnestly requested to introduce him to the Editor, tho&#x2019; only to this limited extent, &#x201C;That his (the Dr&#x2019;s) Contribution should not be at once hurled into the Waste Basket, but should be deliberately examined, and rejected not <hi rend="italic">before</hi> but at worst after that process.&#x201C; Upon this request it is that I am now addressing you.</p>
<p>Of Dr Murray himself I know nothing beyond what is stated above, nor can I be considered to have any personal care for him, except the interest one human being owes another in these circumstances: but of course I at once had to decide on giving him what help was really mine to give,&#x2014;reverencing withal what help was not mine but my neighbour&#x2019;s. What the man means to write about I cannot in the least guess, &#x201C;some neutral subject&#x201C; on which he imagines he can do his best:&#x2014;on any subject I could honestly certify you that what he had deliberately written for the Review would in all probability be <pb id="pg-27-23" n="27:23"/>worth reading by the Editor; and in this way I at first designed to proceed with his affair, undertaking merely to introduce him on that footing <hi rend="italic">after</hi> his article was written.</p>
<p>On second tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> however I find it will be fairer, and probably briefer, if I on the threshold tell you faithfully all I know about him; and give you leave altogether to <hi rend="italic">decline</hi> such an acquaintance (even to the length of reading his Article), if, as is possible, you judge that the more promising method. I have already described the man as accurately as I can: his writing I called <hi rend="italic">forcible</hi>, which it was (plenty of logic and plausibility, on &#x201C;Godless Colleges&#x201C; &#x26;c, as addressed to the Irish Public),&#x2014;forcible and <hi rend="italic">smooth;</hi> but I ought to say that the smoothness seemed to be in part produced by the use of <hi rend="italic">water;</hi> that there were some symptoms of diffuseness, tho&#x2019; none of verbosity; in short that the man&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">force</hi> was by no means that of Thor&#x2019;s thunderbolt, sheering direct into the heart of the matter and scattering into space the superfluous circumambiencies, but was simply a good Irish Blacksmith&#x2019;s forge-hammer, sturdily thumping and forging such metal or dross as chanced to be on the stithy for him. This is the real God&#x2019;s truth about the man, so far as this deponent knoweth;&#x2014;and so I leave his case with you, dear Empson; and he shall remain in suspense till you write to me. In the name of the Prophet, Figs!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace Smith and James Smith, &#x201C;Johnson&#x2019;s Ghost,&#x201C; no. 10 of <hi rend="italic">Rejected Addresses</hi>, see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490929-TC-CGD-01"><sic>24:257</sic><corr>TC to GCD, <date when="1849-09-29">29 Sept. 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p><closer><salute>I send many kind regards to Mrs Empson,&#x2014;many touching remembrances, now grown very sad as well as very beautiful, of <hi rend="italic">Auld Langsyne</hi>, ah me!&#x2014;and will allude to nothing else at present, in this hot haste of mine; but remain as of old Yours always</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p><salute>Dear Duffy,&#x2014;</salute>I will cheerfully do all I can for Dr. Murray; and indeed have already as good as done so, of which I hope to communicate to you the issue in a day or two. I have described Dr. Murray and his project to the editor in question this morning, and put the question to him: <hi rend="italic">Will</hi> you deliberately read his paper if he send one? By this means, taking part of the risk upon myself, I think the problem may perhaps be a little <hi rend="italic">abridged</hi>, and the risk of the other parties less. You shall hear at once what answer there is; till then, keep silence, please. My conviction is that any deliberate essay of Dr. Murray&#x2019;s would decidedly deserve the trouble of <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> by an editor; and doubtless I could <hi rend="italic">so</hi> have managed it in general, and perhaps with this entangled <pb id="pg-27-24" n="27:24"/>blue and yellow in particular; but, as I said, it will be surer, and may probably be briefer, to proceed as now.</p>
<p>Can you send me, one of these days, Dr. Kennedy&#x2019;s address&#x2014;the doctor of whom I saw so much in Dublin, who is <hi rend="italic">Pitt</hi> Kennedy&#x2019;s brother,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Evory Kennedy (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">86</date>; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490626-TC-CGD-01"><sic>24:82</sic><corr>TC to CGD, <date when="1849-06-26">26 June 1849</date></corr></ref>), master of the Dublin lying-in hospital, whom TC had met on his <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date> Irish visit. John Pitt Kennedy (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15387"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Irish agronomist and educationist, military sec. to Sir Charles Napier in India, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>, and railroad engineer in India.</note> and who lives somewhere in the southern outskirts, I think&#x2014;a well-known man? No haste about it, only don&#x2019;t quite forget.</p>
<p>I am truly sorry to hear that your land scheme has come to ruin in so provoking and paltry a way.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The plan to raise money to buy land sold as a result of the Encumbered Estates Act <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date> (see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510426-TC-CGD-01"><sic>26:71</sic><corr>TC to CGD, <date when="1851-04-26">26 April 1851</date></corr></ref>). It came to nothing when Duffy resigned from the Small Proprietors&#x2019; Society because its directors agreed to a proposal made by John Sadleir (<sic><date when="1814-00-00">1814</date></sic><corr><date when="1813-00-00">1813</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24455"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Irish politician, banker, and later a swindler, to transfer the society&#x2019;s account from the Bank of Ireland to two banks with which Sadleir was connected.</note> There can <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> be done, then, for the poor Irish people at present! Nothing by express enactment or arrangement; but they must follow the <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> law of their positions, and sink, sink, till they do come upon rock! I rather judge so; nothing considerable, either for them or for any people or object whatsoever; all objects having got so frightfully enigmatic (hideous and <hi rend="italic">unintelligible</hi>, as the old official <hi rend="italic">masks</hi> drop off them), and our chief interpreter of enigmatic realities being Lord John<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Russell.</note> at this moment&#x2014;an interpreter that probably defies the world for his fellow, if we consider where he is and when he is! Well, there is no help; we must all get down to the <hi rend="italic">rocks;</hi> we are in a place equivalent to <hi rend="italic">Hell</hi> (for every true soul and interest) till we do get thither; there, and there only, on the eternal basis, can there be any &#x201C;heaven&#x201C; and land of promise for the sons of Adam (sons of Hudson, millionaire and penniless alike, I exclude). Thither <hi rend="italic">must</hi> we, as God live&#x2014;and God knows many of us will have a good bit to go before we arrive there, and will need considerable thrashing and tossing before the chaff be well beaten off us, I guess. It is the dismallest epoch, and yet one of the grandest&#x2014;like a putrid Golgotha with immortality beyond it; I do verily believe (in figurative language) comparable to &#x201C;resurrection from the dead.&#x201C; It is in such way I look at it, in silence generally, and welcome even a Brummagem Cromwell of the French as a clear step forward. Five-and-thirty years of Parliamentary stump oratory, all ending in less than nothing; now let us try drill-sergeantry a little even under these sad terms! I find the talk of France to be, and to have been, much madder than even their silence is like to be. God is great.</p>
<p>You are dreadfully unjust to what you call &#x201C;England&#x201C; in almost all you say about Ireland, and in general your interpretation of the former hated entity is <pb id="pg-27-25" n="27:25"/>altogether mistaken, too often (I swear to you) at once lamentable and absurd! I forgive it, as before, but pray always it might alter. There seems to me no possibility of profit in that direction. I had a letter from a brother of Mitchel the other day, who dates Washington, an inquiring, struggling, ingenuous, and ambitious kind of nature, to whom, for John&#x2019;s sake, I made some reply. <closer><salute>Adieu, I hope only for a few days.&#x2014; Yours always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>We got your kind Note, with great pleasure; and afterwards, in due course, read the letter in <hi rend="italic">The Leader</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg continued acting as an occasional anonymous Berlin correspondent.</note>&#x2014;the most rational and comfortable piece of writing I have seen there for some time. Larken, I hear, has got out of that Paper (with fingers burnt, I dare say), and some other person, some West-Country Squire if I recollect has got in: and so the vaporous predication goes on, much as before,&#x2014;the Squire himself, a young man of cash and ambition, being &#x201C;nominal Editor,&#x201C; and Hunt, Lewes and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi> the active partners,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edmund Roberts Larken (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500426-TC-JCA-01"><sic>25:73</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1850-04-26">26 April 1850</date></corr></ref>), extremely liberal or radical clergyman who financially supported the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>, Thornton Leigh Hunt, and G. H. Lewes in <date when="1850-03-00">March 1850</date>. Its original twelve partners gave way to Larken and George Holyoake in <date when="1851-03-00">March 1851</date>, and by the end of the year the paper was owned by Edward Frederick Smyth Pigott (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>), journalist, from Brockley Hall, Somerset, a barrister, who remained its owner until it ended, <date when="1860-11-24">24 Nov. 1860</date>.</note>&#x2014;refreshed, doubtless, to the due degree, and their eyes enlightened, by this dipping of the staff in honey. Except Lewes once, a good while ago, I have seen none of them since before you left us: but, the other morning, there came to me a Printed Paper with &#x201C;Larken&#x2019;s compliments,&#x201C; proposing in emphatic eloquent style a &#x201C;Testimonial (in money subscriptions) to Thornton Hunt&#x201C;; for what heroisms done, I did not learn, having stopped reading at the reading.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS for &#x201C;heading.&#x201C;</note> My tendency to Hero-worship is considerable, but this quite transcends it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu, Eheu!</hi></foreign>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Ever since you went, I continue reading Books about <hi rend="italic">Vater Fritz;</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Father Fritz&#x201C;; i.e., Frederick the Great. In his Journal, <date when="1852-01-28">28 Jan.</date>, TC writes that he began reading about Frederick soon after returning from France, &#x201C;with little definite <hi rend="italic">Prospect</hi> or even object (for I am grown poor in hope and resolution now), I still continue &#x2026; . I make slow progress and am very sensible how <hi rend="italic">lame</hi> I am in such things. Hope is what I now want; Hope is as if dead within me, for most part. Which makes me affect solitude; and <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> much (if wishing were worth aught) that I had even one serious intelligent man to take counsel with, and communicate my thoughts to. But this is weak; no more of this! Know what the inevitable years have brought thee, and reconcile thyself to it.&#x2014;An unspeakable grandeur withal sometimes shines out of all this; like Eternal Light across the scandalous London-fogs of Time. Patience, Courage; steady, steady! &#x2026; Can <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> be my next subject; or what? That is the one question. Enough today.&#x201C;</note> gaining <pb id="pg-27-26" n="27:26"/>out of them, I am sorry to admit, little new love for the man and only very slowly here and there a glimpse of clearer acquaintance with him. Yet I persist; and design to do so, for a while; in my present indeterminate humour, nothing strongly solicits me elsewhither; and, tho&#x2019; there seems no greater likelihood of my ever making a Book upon Friedrich, I may at least go on so long as it amuses me. I have just sent off to Williams and Norgate a considerable list of Books, contingent on the prices, procurability and so forth (<hi rend="italic">Thielke, Nicolai, Garve, Zimmermann</hi> &#x26;c);<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Gottlieb Tielke, <hi rend="italic">Beytr&#xE4;ge zur Kriegs-Kunst; und zur Geschichte des Krieges von <date when="1756-00-00">1756</date> bis <date when="1763-00-00">1763</date></hi>, 6 vols.

Neuberg replied to TC at length, <date when="1852-02-11">11 Feb.</date>, on books about Frederick, and said: &#x201C;But first as to the <hi rend="italic">Maps.</hi>&#x2014; Those which I have by me (and which have now been above two months waiting for a messenger) are <hi rend="italic">not Reymanns</hi>, but six sheets &#x2026; of <hi rend="italic">Stieler&#x2019;s Karte v. Deutsch</hi>d. They contain the various parts of the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> Kingdom of Prussia with the adjacent and intermediate countries: such as a good part of Bohemia, Saxony, Westphalia, Poland &#x26;c. These maps are not nearly so <foreign><hi rend="italic">Spezial</hi></foreign> as <hi rend="italic">Reymann&#x2019;s;</hi> but they are much more compact and handy for general purposes. I shall therefore, with your leave, still send them; as they may be of some service, even with <hi rend="italic">Reymanns</hi> by the side of them for more minute survey.&#x2014;&#x201C; Adolf Stieler (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), cartographer.</note>&#x2014;keeping my eye, too, on what your Note announced of your beneficence to me; on which latter point I am now to make some stricter inquiries.</p>
<p>The discovery of <hi rend="italic">Reymann&#x2019;s Karten</hi> (procurable here at a shilling each, if you take 40 together) was quite a godsend to me the other day: I have read, for weeks, in the sorrowfullest irremediable <hi rend="italic">twilight</hi>, irremediable by human skill without a shilling&#x2019;s worth of that ware! I instantly decided to have all <hi rend="italic">Preussen</hi> (<hi rend="italic">K&#xF6;nigreich</hi>),<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The kingdom of Prussia, which included Silesia and large portions of Poland.

Thus therefore it stands: If you have not yet actually <hi rend="italic">bought</hi> any maps for me, then I strictly charge you not to buy any, the whole being so procurable here,&#x2014;&#x201C;within a fortnight&#x201C; at any time. But in the contrary case, to tell me what you have, to send them as you propose, and to buy no more. This will do for the maps.</p>
<p>As you are in the Prussian dominions, I will give you the chance of asking any good hand there may be, a question or two about Books. Preuss&#x2019;s Books (accurate flat-footed Preuss) I have long known; Friedrich&#x2019;s own I have here;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick disliked the German language, and his many writings are almost all in French.

Private personal <hi rend="italic">memoirs</hi> by actual soldiers of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a grand acquisition to me: pray ask if there are such in print, or if there is any other resource for me, failing that or along with that.</p>

I wrote B&#xfc;sching down among my &#x201C;contingent List&#x201C; to the Bookseller, but could not distinctly articulate any order upon it till after more inquiry and advice.&#x2014; These are the two points I am interested upon. To <hi rend="italic">see</hi>, inside and out, the Soldiers of Fr<hi rend="italic">k</hi> (if I could), and to inform myself about the scene where he danced his great Pyrrhic Dance<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The war dance of the Greeks, performed in full armor to the flute.</note> in this world. I honour Fritz greatly for being a man of unsubduable healthy elasticity and shiftiness (&#x201C;burning his own smoke&#x201C; to a really great extent), and also of perfect <hi rend="italic">veracity</hi>, which in spite of his foxlike cunning, and French-polished completely <hi rend="italic">royal</hi> ways, I clearly perceive him to have been.</p>
<p>My Paper is done; all filled with my own affairs,&#x2014;but you can excuse that. I hope to write again before very long. We are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> dying of terror here, in expectation of a French Invasion! None but fools, and some Writers in <hi rend="italic">the Times</hi>, go very deep into that hitherto. As for me I rather welcome the &#x201C;Brummagen French Cromwell&#x201C; (such as he may turn out), and thank him for stopping the &#x201C;900 talking attorneys&#x201C;) at any rate: one clearly useful thing (after 100 years trial) if he never do another!&#x2014;</p>

      It gives me great pleasure to understand that the Poor Law Association has actually got in motion, and determines to proceed strenuously towards the grand object of having all the paupers of Great Britain set to employment.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">The <hi rend="italic">Manchester Guardian</hi>, <date when="1852-02-04">4 Feb.</date>, noted that a poorly attended meeting of &ldquo;the previous Monday&rdquo; to discuss the objects of the assoc. was adjourned. Stark was one of the secs.</note> I inclose you my subscription, and, along with it, my heartiest wishes for your success. According to all the notions I can form of our strange time, with its manifold perplexities, its vague, high-flying hopes, and fearful, steadily-advancing perils, this that you have in view is precisely the thing needfullest to be done, the first of all real steps towards safety and improvement for English society, as matters now stand. Till some veritably wise and human mode of dealing with that frightful, ever-increasing class called paupers is attained, or, at least, is zealously endeavoured after by the government and the community, I can only consider English society as in a state of slow continual smoke, every day bringing it nearer the state of flame and utter conflagration, into which we have seen all other European societies already go, in a very tragic manner! This is, and has long been, my fixed opinion<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC was already known for writing on the subject as in <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>, &ldquo;The New Poor-Law,&rdquo; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:129&ndash;35, and &ldquo;Manchester Insurrection,&rdquo; <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi> 10:14-23.</note>&mdash;grounded on innumerable considerations, deeper and less deep, on which volumes might be written, and which are of far too extensive compass to be entered upon here. One thing may be asserted without risk, and has the closest reference to this matter. If free bargain in the market, and fair <pb id="pg-27-30" n="27:30" />up-and-down wrestle and battle between employers and employed be the rule of labour (which I am far from believing it capable of being, except for a very limited time, and in very peculiar circumstances); still more, if new and infinitely mere human arrangements between employers and employed are&mdash;as all men begin to surmise, and as many men have long foreseen&mdash;an indispensable necessity for labour, in England as elsewhere, then, clearly, I say, in either case, the first condition of fair play is, that all paupers be quite eliminated from the controversy, and carried clear away from it, out of the labour market, and its wrestles and its struggles. This, one would think, needs little demonstration. Alas! if the pauper were always supported by the rich, especially by the idle rich, I could esteem it for the moment a small matter. But he is supported by the poor, by those who are not yet quite paupers&mdash;whom, with fatal invincibility (and not by his &ldquo;rates&rdquo; alone, but by his bad conduct, by his bad example, by the thousand-fold infection of him every day and hour), he is dragging down into that sad category. It is miserable to consider. The course of every idle, foolish man, left loose to become a pauper&mdash;continually deranging every honest workman&rsquo;s bargain, then taking shelter in the poor-house at the honest workman&rsquo;s expense, then, again, bursting out to produce new derangement and confusion&mdash;is like the course of an incendiary torch among the peaceable possessions of mankind; it is mad as would be the course of a fever patient left to run stumbling about the streets in these times of ours. I do not mean to say that the subject has no difficulties; nay, that it is not like to be, in practice, beset with difficulties, and to lead us, in its ulterior developments, into innovations we are little prepared for at present. I perceive well there is immense work a-head of us in that direction; and I think withal it is high time we were beginning it. As for you, who stand yet in the first stage of the affair, I conceive your ground to be already very clear, and that by temperate and diligent exposition of your aims, you will certainly gain the public support, and probably before long. To an impartial stranger landing among us, as if from another planet, it would seem very strange that there could be a doubt about what you propose! He would find doubts enough, however, and denials enough, and a great quantity of cobwebs to be removed, before he could get this axiom admitted. For indeed, the theories men form about this world, and their political philosophies, and sciences, and dismal sciences, make strange work with them; and truly, &lsquo;to a man <hi rend="italic">doubled down</hi>, and looking backwards through his knees,&rsquo; says the proverb, &lsquo;all things <hi rend="italic">are</hi> inverted, and stand upon their heads!&rsquo; <closer>
  <salute>I again wish you every success, and bid you use every exertion; and am, sir, yours sincerely.</salute>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>There came to me, about a week ago, thro&#x2019; the Foreign Booksellers, a Copy of your new work, <hi rend="italic">Die Carafa von Maddaloni;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Die Carafa von Maddaloni, Neapel unter spanischer Herrschaft</hi>, 2 vols. (Berlin, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>).</note> for which, tho&#x2019; there was no signature or express indication, I consider myself indebted to your own special kindness; and will beg to return you many thanks for so honourable and estimable a Gift. I have read the Book, in spite of multifarious occupation otherwise, and this with a pleasure which is by no means common at the present advanced stage of my reading. Indeed no new Book that I have met with for a good while has nearly so much contented me. It gives proofs of extensive solid study; it abounds in information, much of which is new to me, some of which highly interesting; and there reigns throughout a vivid faculty of delineation which is justly welcome to the reader. The sections on <hi rend="italic">Masaniello</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Properly Tommaso Aniello (<date when="1620-00-00">1620</date>&#x2013;<date when="1647-00-00">47</date>), leader of a revolt against Spanish rule in Naples, murdered by a mob.</note> and the wild scene he worked in, of which I had never any good understanding before, are the best picture I have looked at for many a day. In fine, I have learned many facts from your Book which are more or less memorable; for every one of which I am your debtor, as well as for the peculiar honour done me; and I thank you very sincerely on both grounds.</p>
<p>If this is among your first Books,&#x2014;which point, as I am much a stranger to recent or current German Literature, remains uncertain to me,&#x2014;I think we may expect many other and still higher services from you: and in that case, give me leave to suggest how many noble <hi rend="italic">German</hi> Actions, and heroic characters, are lying buried under mountains of miserable pedant dust; what a wilderness, tenanted by mere Nox and Atropos<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goddess of night and fate, whose duty it was to cut the thread of life.</note> and <hi rend="italic">their</hi> baleful Progeny, the real history of your noble Fatherland still is,&#x2014;as, alas, that of mine also! These facts are not creditable to the Intellect of either country; nay they lead me often into reflexions of a very sad nature, which go down to the heart of the world, and which cannot expect to find much resonance in such days as now are.</p>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>For Heaven&#x2019;s sake let me have a line from some of you about <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>&#x2014;you have been very <hi rend="italic">good</hi> indeed, latterly, in telling me about my Uncle; but my Uncle dearly as I care for him is not the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> person in the house whom I care for; <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have been very ailing Jeannie wrote to me, and I am getting quite uneasy at hearing nothing in the direct line&#x2014;so pray write to me yourself or <hi rend="italic">make</hi> Maggie or Mary write to me, a simple statement of how you now are. This continually changing weather is very trying for all us delicate creatures, especially for those of us who cannot get decently along without exercise in the open air&#x2014; When I can no longer sleep I rush out frantically with an umbrella and come in with pounds of mud at my skirts, and next day get up with fresh cold in my head&#x2014;so long as it is only <hi rend="italic">there</hi> however I may be thankful.</p>
<p>For the rest; there is little to tell. Yesterday I went with Miss Farrer<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Annie Louisa Farrer.</note> to buy some pots of flowers, and when she had terminated her bargaining with the man&#x2014;(she has a mania for beating people down in their prices, that young Lady!) I perceived that I had lost&#x2014;Nero!&#x2014; After looking all about for him, I hurried back home and when the door was opened he bounded out into my arms. Ann said &#x201C;he got a Lady to knock at the door for him!&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;The Lady said &#x201C;wasn&#x2019;t this our dog, she had found him very unhappy in the streets&#x201C;&#x2014;I said to Miss Farrer &#x201C;I wonder he followed a stranger Lady home&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Pooh! says Miss Farrer, depend on it the Lady followed <hi rend="italic">him</hi> home, by way of looking obliging!&#x201C;&#x2014; The half hour&#x2019;s fright however had given me what Ann called &#x201C;quite a turn&#x201C;&#x2014; I could stand the creature&#x2019;s loss now less than ever. Tom Taylor has made a poor thing of the stealing of <hi rend="italic">Mrs Bakers Pet</hi>&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Baker is not half <hi rend="italic">miserable</hi> enough&#x2014;only very foolish<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom Taylor (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27090"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), dramatist and journalist; a contributor to <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> and its future editor, <date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>. &#x201C;Mrs Baker&#x2019;s Pet,&#x201C; a nine-part series of comic sketches in <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi>, in which Scamp is stolen, 22 (<date when="1852-01-10">10 Jan. 1852</date>): 24&#x2013;25, and recovered, 49&#x2013;50.</note>&#x2014; By the way how is Mary&#x2019;s blessed <hi rend="italic">Tear-em?</hi> Her attachment to that I must say not very lovely dog was quite beautiful, so superior to both abuse and ridicule</p>
<p>I went to call for the Sketchleys the other day, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> S was up stairs with the erisiplis<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erysipelas, an acute febrile disease associated with intense local cutaneous and subcutaneous inflammation caused by a streptococcus virus. Mrs. Sketchley and her da. Penelope, a picture copier, formerly of Liverpool.</note> in her face, for which she had, by the light of her own intelligence, <pb id="pg-27-33" n="27:33"/>applied a blister <hi rend="italic">on her breast</hi>&#x2014;&#x201C;to draw it down&#x201C;&#x2014; Penny seemed under no apprehension about her&#x2014;and was <hi rend="italic">carressing</hi> to the last degree&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">flattering.</hi>&#x2014; I dont recollect whether I told you that before I went to the Grange I took Arthur Clough to call for them&#x2014;rather against his will; for his recollections of &#x201C;sitting in the Old Lady&#x2019;s lap&#x201C; seemed neither very lively nor very tender.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had known them in Liverpool.</note> Their reception of him was anything but courteous, tho&#x2019; doubtless meant to be kind&#x2014;assailing him with a minute cross questioning, and accusations for not having &#x201C;found them out&#x201C; sooner. to crown the discourtesy; Penny who had on a former visit been tormenting me in her <hi rend="italic">sturdy-Beggar</hi> fashion, to &#x201C;bring Mazzini that they might see him&#x201C;&#x2014;a hope I told her perfectly desperate; Mazzini being too busy to let himself be shown about.&#x2014;turned round from Clough to me, and said I saw you from the window up stairs with a gentleman, and I said to myself &#x201C;Oh what a good creature she is! there she has brought <hi rend="italic">Mazzini!</hi> and came running down so glad.&#x201C;&#x2014; To which I answered I hope you are glad at what I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> brought you&#x2014;so giving her an opportunity of covering her impoliteness, but she merely said in a lower voice &#x201C;I wish it had been Mazzini&#x201C;!! After I left town they sent M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Clough an invitation to tea and he had actually the good nature to go and be bored with more cross-questioning&#x2014; He came to the Grange after, and in giving me an account of his evening he said both Mother and Daughter had expressed themselves &#x201C;extremely anxious about his <hi rend="italic">opinions</hi>&#x2014;which they were afraid were enda[n]gered<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted. Clough was devoted to Mazzini.</note> by his intimacy with such <hi rend="italic">free thinkers</hi> as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle and his Wife&#x201C;! That was my thanks for taking him to them! Nevertheless I went to call all the same; not caring one pinch of snuff whether the Sketchleys thought me good or bad&#x2014;and Penny could hardly be kept from <hi rend="italic">kissing</hi> me every minute! Lady Ashburton has been in town for a few days on her way to Windsor to visit the Queen&#x2014; She had just laid by all her fine clothes till they should be needed for the London Season&#x2014;the Company at the Grange being all over&#x2014;and had got a couple of gowns packed to go with to Addiscombe when the invitation arrived&#x2014;the Carriage already at the door to take them to the Train&#x2014; So she left her French Maid behind to get out the necessary finery and came up to town without a maid, and &#x201C;d<supplied>[r]</supplied>ove<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> about Islington all the forenoon seeking up a former maid to help her in getting a new gown&#x201C;&#x2014;(as if she hadnt enough) and next day The French woman arrived, having <hi rend="italic">left half of what was required behind her!!</hi> &#x201C;The troubles that afflict the just&#x201C;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

I was talking to her of Emily Baring Lord Ashburtons Sister<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lydia Emily Baring, his youngest sister.</note> saying I wondered that she didn&#x2019;t get married, with sixty thousand pounds&#x2014;&#x201C;Married! said Lady Sandwich&#x2014;what <hi rend="italic">are</hi> you thinking of&#x2014;who would marry anything so ugly?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;But really&#x201C; I said she is not after all so very ugly&#x2014;she is Lady-like has a very nice figure, a good skin and hair&#x2014;is not too old&#x2014;is accomplished amicable; men dont need all that usually to help them to marry sixty thousand pounds!&#x201C;&#x2014; The old Countess sat staring at me till I had done and then exclaimed almost indignantly&#x2014;&#x201C;Great God M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle what nonsense you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> talking! just imagine <hi rend="small-caps">that</hi> <hi rend="italic">nose</hi> on a pillow!&#x201C; but unless you had seen the nose you cannot enjoy the fun of this speech.</p>

<p>I had such a laughable note from Lord Ashburton the other night which I will send you&#x2014;but let me have it back for it contains a <hi rend="italic">riddle</hi> which I have not yet been able to solve&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">where has he put my cushion?</hi>&#x2014; When I was at the Grange I had some wool for <hi rend="italic">crotcheting</hi>&#x2014;by way of drawing-room work, after the <hi rend="italic">dolls</hi> were dressed&#x2014;I had chosen it myself and nothing could well be uglier&#x2014;everybody cried out, &#x201C;what a frightful piece of work!&#x2014;what <hi rend="italic">are</hi> you going to make of it?&#x201C; One night amidst the general reprobation I had spread it on my knee and was looking at it quite disheartened, when Lord A who never attends to what is said or if he does, forgets it in an instant, said suddenly; &#x201C;that is very pretty&#x201C;! &#x201C;you <hi rend="italic">really</hi> think so?&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes&#x2014;certainly!&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Then you shall have it! I will finish it after all&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x201C;! He looked quite terrified&#x2014;every body laughed at him, and Lady A said&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Mouse</hi>, I pity you with that cushion! you will inevitably get it! and whatever you are going to do with it Heaven only knows&#x201C;! A fortnight ago I made it up&#x2014;and left it at Bath House for his coming&#x2014;with a ridiculous note <hi rend="italic">inside</hi> of the paper cover&#x2014; When I saw him on Tuesday evening he said not a word of the cushion and on Thursday night came this note&#x2014; Read it and tell me if you can <hi rend="italic">where has he put my cushion</hi></p>
<p>And now I have written enough to make your eyes weary&#x2014; <closer><salute>Good night dear Helen&#x2014; Kisses to my Uncle and God bless you all&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have received your mournful Poetical Epistle. Surely that is a sad scene that you describe: and, alas, there are many such, known to us and unknown;&#x2014;to which I, of all men, may declare myself among the least likely to be indifferent or insensible. If there were but any remedy possible at present; if there were but any sure hope of remedy!&#x2014;</p>
<p>To the Guild of Literature<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Guild of Literature and Art had been founded by Dickens, Forster, and others, in <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510704-JWC-HW-01"><sic>26:99</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1851-07-04">4 July 1851</date></corr></ref>. It was to assist writers and artists in need, and to encourage them to help themselves. The correspondent had apparently written to enlist TC&#x2019;s support for someone unidentified.</note> I have all along, what was but a small merit, wished the best success; regretting that my power to help it ended even there. Surely if, in this or another generation, it save one man of merit from a fate such as you describe, it will have done some good to all men! But effectual remedy, I take it, in this as in other cases, must come from the heart of the thing itself, and cannot be got by acting on the diseased outskirts of it from without;&#x2014;and of that I see few symptoms in these sad times. For the rest, my knowledge of your Guild and its intentions and procedures is so entirely vague, any judgement I have formed about it is, so far as others are concerned, equal to no judgement, and ought not to discourage anybody in his good endeavours that way.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thank you very much for all the trouble you took about Craigenputtoch and me. I think we may say, Jamie and you have fairly made a good job of it so far: &#xa3;30 a year of additional rent, and the prospect of a much more comfortable <pb id="pg-27-36" n="27:36"/>tenant, and better treatment for the poor Place, than we could have looked for under M&#x2019;Queen.</p>
<p>As to the Offers, they seem about alike in <hi rend="italic">real</hi> amount, or perhaps the &#xa3;210 <hi rend="italic">without</hi> onerous conditions may be the higher of the two. At any rate we are clearly free to choose; and in the given state of uncertainty as to which is &#x201C;higher,&#x201C; neither you nor Jamie are tied either way by the terms you offered.</p>
<p>All things considered, therefore, I think I will decidedly give the preference to <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi> Bell (the Minsca<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a relative of George Bell of Minsca, 3 mi. NW of Scotsbrig; see also <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500909-TC-JWC-01"><sic>25:205</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1850-09-09">9 Sept. 1850</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-25/lt-18501104-TC-JAC-01"><sic>274</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1850-11-04">4 Nov. 1850</date></corr></ref>.</note> man), and commission you to make out the bargain with <hi rend="italic">him</hi> according to the terms indicated. It is a great point with me to get the place well looked after, and kept in a neat manner, without negociation or farther bother of any kind. Let him be preferred, therefore, unless you have some objection that I know not of.</p>
<p>Probably, being a man of trim habits, he may himself be trusted with the details of repairing the Dwellinghouse &#x26;c; and any sum not exceeding &#xa3;20 (of course he will present the <hi rend="italic">accounts</hi> &#x26;c when all is finished) may be allowed him for that end.&#x2014;&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Weedings</hi> out of the woods he is very welcome to for his gates: the only question here must be, Is he a man of sufficient honour to be trusted with going to cut them himself, and generally with taking a kind of conscientious supervision of these poor woods in the absence of other authority? I will beg you to try and do the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> you can in regard to this latter point. Suppose Jamie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">permission</hi> was required for <hi rend="italic">cutting</hi> any tree, would not that be safer? It would involve the necessity of Jamie visiting Craigenputtoch once in the year or so: but that we could take into account, and indeed I think it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a very good thing anyway. Or w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> you put it altogether on Bell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">honour</hi>, as on the whole the safest method? To cut only <hi rend="italic">weedings</hi>, and choose them on his own conscience? Do what seems wisest; and I will conform, having no power of myself to judge.</p>
<p>In like manner with regard to draining, I should (as you already know) <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> altogether willing to encourage, and even well-placed to lay out a little money that way (at 5 per cent) if sure that it were to good advantage; but I think it will be best to make no express stipulation on the matter, to let the man <hi rend="italic">try</hi> it himself first; in all cases, to let it be understood, <hi rend="italic">Jamie&#x2019;s consent</hi>, and 5 per cent of interest during the lease, were to be first had. This, I believe, will do for the draining, with what you already know of my notions on that hand.</p>
<p>And indeed this is properly all I have to say in regard to the operation of letting Craigenputtoch generally; and so I will leave it with you, and hope it is <pb id="pg-27-37" n="27:37"/>now within sight of port; and that Mr Adamson, with a few lines of black-on-white, will now very shortly reduce it to a fixed condition, and let us handsomely wash our hands of it.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Adieu, dear Brother, I know not whether you will need another ride to Dumfries; but if so, I trust it will now be but one on that errand.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute> I know not whether, on the foregoing <hi rend="italic">paperkins</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The previous letter.</note> I have quite written a thing that you can shew to Adamson (or at least, <hi rend="italic">send</hi> to him by post); indeed it was not till near the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> that I fairly came upon that tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, tho&#x2019; it was dimly at work behind my pen:&#x2014;at all events, I will add on this separate sheet all that remains on general topics.</p>
<p>I send the Yankee Letter, spoken of to my Mother:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the man who named his son after TC; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520130-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1852-01-30">30 Jan</date></ref>.</note> his <hi rend="italic">general</hi> enthusiasm may amuse her for a little. I also send Jamie&#x2019;s (and Mary&#x2019;s) <hi rend="italic">Books</hi> on Sterling, by post, today: I was always intending to make up some <hi rend="italic">general</hi> railway-parcel, of old clothes and <hi rend="italic">etceteras;</hi> but the stock is too poor, the <hi rend="italic">difficulties</hi> make me boggle: in short, I will let that enterprise lie for the present. This morning I received the <hi rend="italic">Hamilton Newspaper</hi> and address in Jenny&#x2019;s hand, of the first of which I send a clipping with the <hi rend="italic">date</hi>, and the Second of which comes in <foreign><hi rend="italic">extenso</hi></foreign>,&#x2014;to be a little comfort to my Mother&#x2019;s anxieties. I have lost Jenny&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">street</hi> in Hamilton: if you will remember to send it me, I will forward her some kind of symbol or message by and by. <hi rend="italic">Item</hi> I think of sending a small purse (&#xa3;25 or so) to poor little Jane (Sandy&#x2019;s Jane) on her wedding day:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Welsh Carlyle (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s da., m. Robert Sims.</note> Adamson is the man, is he not, and the way plain?&#x2014;</p>
<p><closer><salute>Dear Brother, this is all; I am hurried beyond measure, and have done little else but write Letters for a week (every <hi rend="italic">fore</hi>noon): Heigho!

<p>Yesterday came your Letter; thanks, gracious Lady: you do for me, right kindly, what good you can; and are, in fact, admirable to me in that as in other respects, and do deserve my wonder and my gratitude both in one. Heaven, I suppose, will pay you; as for me I never can. Or perhaps we are ready to go <hi rend="italic">un</hi>paid? That, I take it, is the genuine way!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On Sunday evening,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC writes on Tues.</note>&#x2014;for I had thriftily reserved my little bit of earthly felicity (so terribly seasoned with bitter salt, many times!) till then&#x2014;on Sunday evening at the old hour, I set off, in waterproof equipment, towards Bath House,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons&#x2019; house in Piccadilly.</note> under the heaviest pour of rain I have seen for some years: the very hackney-coaches and omnibuses seemed mostly washed away; I had all the streets to myself and my umbrella, no company but the gaslamps and my own independent meditations:&#x2014;at Bath House you know what I met; but I protest I took it lovingly; and the wet walk (with the Devil <hi rend="italic">somewhat</hi> subdued out of it) did me both benefit and pleasure. Alas, we are not very lucky of late! Nor is it easy to see much luck in the distance ahead;&#x2014;yet, looking into such eyes as yours, it is not possible always altogether to despair. In fact you are a kind of miraculous or altogether exceptional creature, your Ladyship is; and I know not precisely what to think about you!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The same Sunday afternoon, late, I was at Hyde Park with Clough (Clough probably called at Bath House too); and there we met the Bear<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Ellice, called the Bear, financier, politician, and friend of the Ashburtons.</note> under an umbrella in the Scotch-mist, with whom I turned. The good Bear: full of hope and cheery speculation, as usual, which one felt to be mostly soft-murmuring pleasant wind!&#x2014; I do not yet know, and perhaps shan&#x2019;t till Saturday night, &#x201C;what constitution&#x201C; we are to live under according to L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> John:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord John Russell had introduced an English reform bill to double the suffrage allowed under the <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> Reform Bill. The new bill (excluding Scotland and Ireland) was pbd. at the end of the week; see <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1852-02-14">14 Feb.</date></note> I have not yet met with one human creature who cared a straw about it one way or the other. Radicals and ultras have no faith in the ninth-part of a tailor<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverb: &#x201C;Nine tailors make a man.&#x201C; Russell was diminutive.</note> that he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> mean anything effectual in their or any sense; and from other parties, one hears the little trick denounced with sufficient scorn. No more despised &#x201C;English Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,&#x201C; I do believe, ever darkened the light of the sun. A deeply disgraceful fact to us; worse than any &#x201C;Invasion of the French&#x201C; is like to be,&#x2014; <pb id="pg-27-39" n="27:39"/>even tho&#x2019; they burn your old Bathing Machine in Stokes Bay,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hants., nr. the Grange.</note> and do other conceivable mischief.</p>
<p>On Friday I saw Lady Sandwich, amid a crowd of other Ladies; merry and graceful as need be,&#x2014;hopeful too, tho&#x2019; she seems to have given up London and its houses, and looks steadily to Paris again. Jane has seen her since (Jane, but I think, not Nero); and praises, as ever, her pleasant polite ways. Good old Lady:&#x2014;perhaps Paris will be the best after all, now that it has got an <hi rend="italic">Eagle</hi> again.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Under the Bonapartes, France had an eagle for its standard.</note> &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Le premier vol</hi></foreign>&#x201C; is first-rate in the genus <hi rend="italic">pun:</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It can mean either &#x201C;The first flight&#x201C; or &#x201C;The first theft.&#x201C;</note> if the French take into &#x201C;Despotism tempered by Epigrams,&#x201C; who knows but they may do rather well for a few years again!&#x2014;Mazzini holds a grand <foreign>soir&#xE9;e</foreign>, or Lecture with Coffee (price 2/6), for behoof of his Italian Society, tomorrow ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, in the Freemasons Tavern,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC went to the &#x201C;first <foreign>conversazione</foreign>&#x201C; of the Society of the Friends of Italy, Wed. <date when="1852-02-11">11 Feb.</date>, at 7 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi>, with a lecture by Mazzini.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter from Jenny which, having done with it myself, I am to send you: the others, I find, including Mary, have already seen it. Poor little Jenny appears still to be doing well.</p>
<p>You complained last time, justly, that my letter was short: alas, this is like to be still shorter; for, in fine, such a racket of paltry confusions goes on about one in this place, and such a waste daily of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> hours that you do not snatch as if from the fire,&#x2014;I can get (literally) no letter written; or indeed almost nothing done that I like to do! Of the letters I write, 19-20ths are to persons and on subjects not belonging to my<hi rend="italic">self</hi> or my own wishes at all at all; and many I do not answer in any way, but fling them at once into the fire. It is very irritating, but it is not to be helped: so let us say no more of it.</p>
<p>We are in our usual health here; weather now dry and rather frosty, with a <pb id="pg-27-41" n="27:41"/>decided <hi rend="italic">spring</hi> look (these two days), after such a deluge of muddy sooty wet weeks as I do not remember to have seen in these climates before. Gutta-percha soles, old hat, and waterproof coat have been in constant requisition. I occasionally get a ride too, on a swift racer of Anthony Sterling&#x2019;s, which he is glad to get an excuse for not himself riding. On the whole I seem to be a little <hi rend="italic">better</hi> in health than is usual with me for several years back: my Malvern adventures, and still more my now constant walk before breakfast, and alas also the idle <hi rend="italic">fallow</hi> state of my intellect at present, have brought about this perceptibly (or half-perceptibly) improved condition, such as it is.&#x2014; I keep extremely quiet, am generally alone; and indeed find little but annoyance in the grinning balderdash of most persons that are accessible to me. It is better to be sad and silent than to pretend mirth on those terms. I read a good deal; but cannot flatter myself that I am yet within short way of getting into any definite work of my own. We must wait and watch. They are on all hands <hi rend="italic">reviewing</hi> that <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi>, it would appear, and finding it heterodox and I know not what: but as I do not give myself the trouble to look into any such impertinent palaver, of course they are very welcome. I suppose (in a slight degree) the more noise they make, abusively or otherwise, the more sale there is. Yesterday I was in the London Library, and knew that 3 or perhaps 4 reviews of me were lying on the table, but had no curiosity to look at one of them: dirty creatures, it is not a pleasant spectacle at all!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See vol. 26 for reviews.</note> Nor is this <hi rend="italic">philosophy</hi> on my part: alas, I grieve to say it is only weariness, contempt, and old age. When the day is sinking, and one&#x2019;s journey still far, who w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> please to bother himself with the village curs barking?&#x2014; &#x2014; Certain Paris Editors (on behalf of a famed French review of theirs) have written <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> for &#x201C;some autobiographic notes,&#x201C; and for a &#x201C;daguerrotype&#x201C; (or repitition<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> of our last years experience);<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See TC to Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Buloz, ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi>, <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511117-TC-FB-01"><sic>26:233</sic><corr>TC to FB, <date when="1851-11-17">17 Nov. 1851</date></corr></ref>.</note> both of which modest requests I have twice politely refused.</p>
<p>Jack has had a terrible business letting Craigenputtoch for me; but seems to have succeeded admirably at last: I think this T. Bell may prove the most comfortable tenant we have yet had.&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Sister. Did my Mother send you a reading of <hi rend="italic">Chambers&#x2019;s Burns</hi> (3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> vol. just gone to her)?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Life and Works of Robert Burns</hi>, ed.

Vol. 4, the final one, was pbd. later in <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>; vols. 1 and 2 in <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>.</note> You might find it worth looking at. And tell me in general how you are off for Books? And what you are doing, and how going on. Don&#x2019;t be too long in writing. <closer><salute>My best regards to James and the <foreign>Bairns</foreign>. Yours, dear Sister</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks again for all your trouble about Craigenputtoch, which I hope is now nearly over, and will turn to good account. Our new tenant seems very eligible every way, and you have put all things on such a footing as promises perfectly well. I think I have seen T. Bell once, at poor Miss Currie&#x2019;s funeral:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1850-08-31">31 Aug. 1850</date>, of Nancy Corrie, da. of Alexander Corrie of Newfield Farm, who had been cared for by Dr. John Carlyle, but died of dysentery; see vol. 25.</note> a smart young fellow, and come of a good kind of people.&#x2014; Jane tells me the kitchen-table or dresser does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> belong to us, but was handsomely purchased for money down by the late John M&#x2019;Queen;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He died <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>; for articles purchased, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340522-JWC-TC-01"><sic>7:182</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1834-05-22">22 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> and that, indeed, except the grates, she can recollect nothing of furniture belonging to us but a miserable old cobweb of a <hi rend="italic">painted-fir Book-case</hi>, which I remember very well, which must be standing somewhere about the house, and which Mr Bell is welcome to the gift of, if it can be of any use to him. This is the one item, it appears; and this will not be a difficult one to settle. And so we will wish them well into their new place when Whitsunday comes; and rejoice that poor old Puttoch is to have light kindled in it again, and to look civilized when one goes <pb id="pg-27-43" n="27:43"/>to see it. Surely I am much obliged to Jamie and you; and you have managed everything for me to perfection.</p>
<p>It is grave news, but we must not call it sad since it is natural and necessary, this of <hi rend="italic">young</hi> Jamie&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James&#x2019;s and Isabella&#x2019;s son.</note> going out to seek a trade for himself in the world. Poor fellow he will have his battle to fight, as all have; but I hope he carries with him a clear head and an honest heart, adequate to bring him thro&#x2019; the enterprise <hi rend="italic">without</hi> ultimate failure, or want of what victory is needful in the end!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Of course I would cheerfully write to Adamson, or do whatever I honestly could for him; but it will be good to understand first what the lye of the matter really is, and whether there is any reasonable chance of prospering on that side. I did not know even that Adamson was still a Lawyer and kept Clerks, but taking that to be the case, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> it not be proper, first of all, to ascertain a little (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> could be done by James Aitken or otherwise, in a quiet way) whether Adamson <hi rend="italic">has</hi>, or is near having, or is likely soon to have, any vacancy in his Law-Office? He cannot make a vacancy if there is none. Or w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> you wish him to be asked to look out among the other Dumfries lawyers for a vacancy in Jamie&#x2019;s favour?&#x2014; Then, secondly, what is the practical state of Jamie&#x2019;s qualifications? Is his penmanship (which of course w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> daily improve) good <hi rend="italic">enough?</hi> Is not some elementary scantling of Latin considered a kind of requisite? &#x26;c &#x26;c If these points are satisfactory, and Adamson <hi rend="italic">has</hi> anything to give, be sure I will write at once, and zealously (so far as my rights can go) solicit him for Jamie&#x2019;s and all our sakes.</p>
<p>What R<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Calvert<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Carlyle&#x2019;s brother.</note> offers at Manchester is very dim to me, and &#x201C;6 / a week&#x201C; at starting is certainly poor wages: nevertheless I confess I have more hope of that, altogether, than of the Lawyer scheme in Dumfries. It is apparently some kind of <hi rend="italic">introduction</hi> towards Clerkship and regular concern with Commerce and its businesses, so far as the youth&#x2019;s faculties and behaviour give encouragement? That, I think, in these days, is a far manlier outlook than Scotch Law in a stagnant little County-Town full of all kinds of bad habits, and of <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi> which is the mother of all. Jamie might be more <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> and grave, for a while, under the big smoke-canopy of Manchester; but he might find <hi rend="italic">good</hi> connexions and companionships there, if he looked well out for them, more readily than in Dumfries: he might attend evening-classes at the Mechanics-Institute Schools (which I think are good), learn <hi rend="italic">French</hi> and much that would be useful to him in his business and otherwise: in short there is clearly a much more generous field open for a young man of good energies and intentions than in the other case;&#x2014;and it strikes me Mr Calvert ought to be inquired of farther as to this matter: what his own capabilities and purposes towards his Nephew are or are like to be, and what those of the <pb id="pg-27-44" n="27:44"/>world (so far as Mr C. can advise) are like to be.&#x2014; And, in the meanwhile, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> it not be good, if Jamie have decided on following <hi rend="italic">some</hi> such line of life, and is not yet certain <hi rend="italic">what</hi> or <hi rend="italic">where</hi>, that he went instantly to some kind of <hi rend="italic">schooling</hi> again, and employed every moment of his time in gaining needful knowledge (penmanship, French, Geography, a little Latin &#x26;c &#x26;c, as you could advise) till all that were settled whether for Dumfries, for Manch<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, or whithersoever else. He must remember that only by running with his whole pith, and putting off no moment, is there a chance of victory in this race;&#x2014;that for an &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">easy</hi> life,&#x201C; working with his hands and muscles will be mere child&#x2019;s play (strange as it may seem) to what lies ahead of a man in this other course at present!&#x2014; &#x2014; &#x2014; In short, I am quite in the dark as to what is the eligiblest for Jamie; whom I do not <hi rend="italic">know</hi>, properly, at all, but take to be a very honest and sensible lad; and certainly commend for deciding to do <hi rend="italic">something.</hi> I write down, in <hi rend="italic">great</hi> haste, what occurs to me: and, for the rest, need not say that I am ready to help in any thing where I visibly can. I confess I bend most towards Manchester, and have small <hi rend="italic">brow</hi> of Dumfries in any form. Also that if there is likely to be any delay in getting a decision, Jamie ought to employ it zealously in additional schooling. This is all at present.</p>
<p>I sent my Mother a <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi> (3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> vol) the other day, of which I think she will not get much good. It can be given to Brother Jamie who used to have a taste for Burns,&#x2014;this and the other two volumes, if they are still <hi rend="italic">to the fore</hi>, and my Mother has no other use for them. Good old Mother, I am very thankful to hear of her favourable state:&#x2014;the good weather is now coming, which will do good to us all.&#x2014; &#x2014; I had a Letter from Neuberg<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated from Bonn, <date when="1852-02-11">11 Feb.</date></note> yesterday; but it is a mere <hi rend="italic">List of Books</hi> (loyally meant, and good but not important) on Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Great: another like it, by way of <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi>, is promised: <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>k is getting quite a <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> subject with me,&#x2014;</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">wozu, wozu</hi></foreign> [why, why]?&#x2014; My love to my good Mother and to all the rest. Ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>Today I am going out to ride; and have to write you first a little word,&#x2014;upon &#x201C;business&#x201C; (save the mark!). On Saturday I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to have written, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> business; but, as usual, the chaos-flood swam me away, and when the time came there were not means. It was better not. Alas, in this unthrifty <pb id="pg-27-45" n="27:45"/>position of mine, &#x201C;Secretary of State (in Chelsea) <hi rend="italic">without</hi> appointments,&#x201C; it is only or almost only to the bores and blockheads of the Earth, and on affairs which are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> my own, that I have free privilege of writing: certainly more than nineteen twentieths of the letters I write are to persons towards whom my whole mind were absolute <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>,&#x2014;not to say, in many cases, an explosion of execrations (if there were no laws of politeness extant)! A bad position, you admit: but what remedy? As usual, there is no remedy; and, in fact, we must let it lie there, and not say more of it just now. The &#x201C;business&#x201C; I had to write of is this.</p>
<p>You named to me a French Book on Modern European Politics,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Fichelment</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Fiquelment</hi> or some such name, a Frenchman who might rather be agreeable to me; of whom, if I liked, I might have a reading.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carl Ludwig von Ficquelmont (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), Austrian gen. and politician, whom TC thought French because of his name; author of <hi rend="italic">Des Ministers Ficquelmont Einsetzung und Abdankung &#x2026; von einem Manne der entschiedensten Opposition</hi> (Vienna, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), <hi rend="italic">Aufkl&#xE4;rungen &#xfc;ber die Zeit vom 20 M&#xE4;rz bis zum 4 Mai <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> &#x2026; Zweite Auflage</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), and <hi rend="italic">Deutschland, Oesterreich und Preussen</hi> (Vienna, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>).</note> Do you recollect the Book by this description? It is for the <hi rend="italic">Title</hi> of the Book (correct <hi rend="italic">name</hi>, place, size, year, and <hi rend="italic">price</hi> if you know that too) that I now apply. I do not want the <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> just now; because your Book will surely get dirtied if you send it me:&#x2014;but Mazzini needs it, intending to write some <hi rend="italic">review</hi> or other on some cognate subject;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini wrote &#x201C;Europe: Its Condition and Prospects,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> 57 (<date when="1852-04-00">April 1852</date>): 442&#x2013;67.</note> and happening to hear my Wife mention it, and the Bookseller declaring he had never heard of it by that mutilated title,&#x2014;he (M<hi rend="italic">i</hi>) comes up to me yesterday with a demand for the same. I said he should have the exact <hi rend="italic">title</hi> soon,&#x2014;more power to his elbow. And this is my &#x201C;business&#x201C;;&#x2014;a weighty one, is it not?&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Mazzini&#x2019;s <foreign>Soir&#xE9;e</foreign>, which my Wife attended, along with Clough and some other male and female disciples of good figure, was &#x201C;perfectly successful&#x201C; after its kind:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520210-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1852-02-10">10 Feb.</date></ref></note> a very harmless meeting; properly a kind of <hi rend="italic">Lecture</hi>, with fringings of coffee (<hi rend="italic">voluntary</hi> coffee): Lecture wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> M. <hi rend="italic">read</hi> in the most artless manner, &#x201C;with candles <hi rend="italic">between</hi> him and the little slips of paper,&#x201C; and as practically as a grocer&#x2019;s bill,&#x2014;since to be seen (by me not to be read) in the public Papers,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, <date when="1852-02-12">12 Feb.</date></note>&#x2014;and listened to with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> commentary, except of feet and hands by a believing auditory of the youthful middle-classes near a thousand strong. Good luck to it;&#x2014;the obliquity of the ecliptic<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The angle between the planes of the earth&#x2019;s equator and its orbit, gradually lessening by 0.47&#x201C; per year.</note> will not change for that sort of matter just at this time. Ledru Rollin was believed to be present: but he has now, ever since the <foreign><hi rend="italic">coup d&#x2019;&#xE9;tat</hi></foreign> shaved off his moustaches and is not distinguishable <pb id="pg-27-46" n="27:46"/>from common French citizens.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin. Karl Marx (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1883-00-00">83</date>) wrote from London to a correspondent in New York, <date when="1852-02-20">20 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Ledru-Rollin himself has collapsed here like a punctured balloon since <date when="1851-12-02">2 December [1851</date>, the date of Louis Napoleon&#x2019;s <foreign>coup d&#x2019;&#xE9;tat</foreign>,] and the arrival of new revolutionary elements from France.

Jane also saw, with Plattnauer a half-mad friend of hers, the <foreign><hi rend="italic">ci-devant</hi></foreign> [former] &#x201C;Minister of Public Instruction&#x201C; in Rome,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francesco Sturbinetti (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>) was minister of public instruction during the last days of the Roman republic, but TC may be thinking of someone else.</note>&#x2014;a wretched little yellow moth-eaten-looking man, smoking an extremely bad cigar with poor Plattnauer, to whom he is now teacher of Italian. O heaven, what a mad farce-tragedy of a world this is,&#x2014;and has for a long time, in an extremely high degree, been! If Louis Napoleon never do any more good in the world, this of closing the windpipe of the &#x201C;nine hundred talking attornies&#x201C; is a benefit we ought never to forget. The hundred or two of revolutionary <foreign><hi rend="italic">brulots</hi></foreign> [firebrands] and editorial and other <foreign><hi rend="italic">brouillons</hi></foreign> [mischief-makers], whom he has safely swamped in the mud of Cayenne,&#x2014;may not that too, tho&#x2019; a dreadfully ugly job of scavengerism, be a most salutary and useful one?&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>I continue reading about <hi rend="italic">Frederic;</hi> ordering maps, running after books &#x26;c to see what I am to order.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We heard of you lately thro&#x2019; Jenny; and were gratified to learn that you were all well, and that things were going on in the usual style with you. Poor Jenny appears to have improved greatly in spirits since she made this courageous adventure to your side of the water; indeed she never had, or was like to have, any peace of mind or real contentment at Dumfries; so it behoved her to go, whatever became of it: on the whole it seems to have turned out very well hitherto; and we can reasonably hope she will find it a change for the better. Her husband may perhaps continue steady henceforth, with these new chances and inducements; and in that case there is room for all sorts of good anticipations. Poor soul, he has been well scourged too for his errors; and, we may hope, will learn his lesson, as the rest of us have had to do! Meanwhile it is a pleasant new interest for you in Canada, this in Hamilton; and it gives all of us comfort to reflect upon it for both your sakes.</p>
<p>The most interesting news you have sent lately is that &#x201C;little Jane,&#x201C; who has <pb id="pg-27-48" n="27:48"/>now grown a big enough Jane, is about to be married,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Robert Sims.</note> and set up for her little self! Good little lassie, I remember her always, and shall always remember her, as a <hi rend="italic">gleg</hi> little <foreign><hi rend="italic">bairn;</hi></foreign> and it is joyful, sorrowful, and in all ways pathetic and interesting to me to hear of this new phasis of her history. Jane and I have often talked of it here; and if good wishes could make her life lucky, I do not think it would fail in that respect. You must tell us something more about her intended; some honest manful young lad, I hope;&#x2014;to whom, if he comport himself well, there is a fair prospect open for beginning life. Things do differ infinitely in your new home and in your old one here, in that respect! With us, the outlook is daily more confused, difficult and almost <hi rend="italic">impossible:</hi> I confess, it would be a terror to me, had I children to try to set up in this horrible complexity. And things will not <hi rend="italic">mend;</hi> I believe they have to grow much <hi rend="italic">worse</hi>, or at least universally <hi rend="italic">bad</hi>, before mending; and that they will not take <hi rend="italic">that</hi> turn &#x201C;in our thank&#x201C; at all. Painful as it has been, dear Brother, you ought to be very thankful, and all of us ought, that you and yours are where you are and as you are!&#x2014; Enclosed here is a scrap of thin paper; which, I am taught, will grow into &#x201C;Forty Pounds <hi rend="italic">with a premium</hi>&#x201C; (some small <hi rend="italic">advantage</hi> in the exchange) at any Bank in your neighbourhood or elsewhere: I must ask you to get it cashed, and keep it ready; and to give it to poor little Jane, on her wedding-day, as a gift from her Uncle and Aunt. This is all the transaction;&#x2014;and if my blessing along with it could be of any avail to the young pair, sure enough that, too, silently goes.&#x2014; For the rest, address me a Newspaper with <hi rend="italic">three</hi> strokes so soon as you fairly get the cash, and do not, except it is handy for you, <hi rend="italic">write</hi> just at once,&#x2014;unless there be something <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> with the Draft, as I do not expect there will. And may all good be with our dear little Jane; and may her House, too, in the wilderness, be an honest and a fruitful industrious and blessed one!&#x2014; That is all on this head.</p>
<p>You would notice perhaps in your <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> that Craigenputtoch was advertised again to be let.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520110-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1852-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref></note> John M&#x2019;Queen died suddenly, and Tom became tenant for two years; the lease being now out, Jamie (of Scotsbrig) went to examine, and reported that the farm was worth at <hi rend="italic">least</hi> &#xa3;200: M&#x2019;Queen was offered it at that; declined to rise a penny above the old rent (&#xa3;180); and so he being otherwise a kind of <hi rend="italic">slattern</hi>, we determined to advertise as you saw. The place is now taken at &#xa3;210, by one Tho<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Bell, lately of Whitcastle,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Whitecastle farm, Applegarth parish, between Lockerbie and Moffat.</note> whose father you knew: a smart, promising, newly-married and altogether eligible kind of tenant: so that this business (thanks to the Doctor, who has been extremely active in it) seems speedily and satisfactorily settled. Poor old Puttoch, it is the emblem to us of days that are far gone, and to me as to you it is sad, <pb id="pg-27-49" n="27:49"/>and grand withal, like the lands beyond the Grave!&#x2014; &#x201C;A brother of Joseph M&#x2019;Adam&#x2019;s,&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Former tenant of Craigenputtoch; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320629-TC-AC-01"><sic>6:180</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1832-06-29">29 June 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> it seems, was one of the applicants; but, beyond all others, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could never have been preferred, I should say!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Doubtless the Doctor has reported to you how they are going on at Scotsbrig. Jamie, in the complicated shifting course of things, manages very discreetly, and contrives to get along better than most of his neighbours: I understand the steamers and rails are gradually dragging all Annandale into new methods,&#x2014;into graziery and beef, instead of ploughing and corn. Jamie goes more and more upon sheep of late years. (I understand there is going to be a railway past you also, and far better trade for your corn than you yet have.) All is changing in every province of this world:&#x2014;Our dear old Mother is still reported to me as &#x201C;well for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>&#x201C;: but I find she is really very frail, the good old Mother, and passes most of her time (reading) &#x201C;in bed,&#x201C; this winter; Mary&#x2019;s eldest daughter (Marg<hi rend="italic">t</hi>) attends to the house, and manages all domesticities for the Doctor and her. Such is the arrangement since Winter began; which I have no doubt is a great improvement. God bless our dear old Mother and them all! will be your prayer as well as mine.&#x2014; &#x2014; I duly got signal of the <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> Book having come to you: the other day I sent one, of the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> edition, to Jenny&#x2019;s address. There goes on an immense uproar of <hi rend="italic">reviewing</hi> (mostly scolding and screeching, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seem); but I never read any of it: &#x201C;Di&#x2019;tha naither ill na&#x2019; guid!&#x201C;&#x2014;<closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother.

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>I have not a moment left, and not a word of good news (or indeed of bad) to tell you: nevertheless I cannot let the week end without an audible sign of recollection,&#x2014;which, inaudible, I suppose you know continues thro&#x2019; most weeks and days. If it were good for anything: but for what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> it good? Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got your Letter on Friday, very welcome to me; and now today, in very great haste, I send a word of answer, as to the needful Thrashing-Machine question.</p>
<p>Beyond dispute that old article belongs, and has always belonged, to the Farm; so it stood in my time; nobody ever bought it, or thought of buying it, since: and so, I suppose, Mr Bell will without any controversy get possession of the venerable fixture. As it must be about 40 years old, I fancy it is in a very frail condition by this time!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have terribly cold weather here for a week past or more: bitter, grey eastwind, consisting of mere ice and dust; skies as hard as iron. Most likely it is very good for field-work; but I am anxious to know how my poor Mother stands it;&#x2014;I conclude she does not in the least venture out; and indeed I think <hi rend="italic">bed</hi>, with an interesting book if she had one, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the best place for her. Good old Mother:&#x2014;but there is better weather coming; and surely not very far off now. I myself have caught a little sniff of cold, which is too slight and contemptible to be spoken of; Jane, who mostly keeps within doors, but has gone out just now (2&#xBD; p.m.), continues in her usual way. We were at dinner on friday night with one Ellice in Arlington Street (a wide-flowing old Canadian Scotchman, Politician, Negociator &#x26;c &#x26;c, called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Bear</hi> Ellice&#x201C; in society here, but rather for his <hi rend="italic">oiliness</hi> than any trace of ferocity ever seen in him): Thiers, the Ashburtons, Thackeray &#x26;c &#x26;c were there; and much confused talk, in bad French and otherwise,&#x2014;it was just at the time when Palmerston was beating the Ministry,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520216-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1852-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref></note> and Notes &#x26;c came in from the Clubhouses; a rather sad evening amid all the levity that was going on! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Monsieur</hi></foreign>, I said to Thiers, who is a goodhumoured little body, but without talents except small and rather contemptible ones, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Mons</hi>r, <hi rend="italic">aussi nous, nous cheminons &#xE0; grands pas vers</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">n&#xF4;tre</hi> <hi rend="italic">Louis Napoleon; quelque Cromwell Second, qui jetera tout cela dans la rivi&#xE8;re. Partout la &#x2018;Constitution&#x2019; tir&#xE9; &#xE0; sa fin!</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Monsieur, we also, we proceed by large strides toward <hi rend="small-caps">our</hi> Louis Napoleon; some second Cromwell, who will toss all that in the river. Everywhere the &#x2018;Constitution&#x2019; is coming to its end.&#x201C;</note> The little man was not much edified by the remark: and in general my seriousness was matter only of amusement to the old stagers. I myself cannot be amused at the things I see.</p>
<p>All people are buzzing about now with tidings of the new Derby-Disraeli ministry: L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Derby (late <hi rend="italic">Stanley</hi>) to be at the top; Sir Stratford Canning <pb id="pg-27-52" n="27:52"/>(home from Constantinople) Foreign Sec<hi rend="italic">y;</hi> the Jew Disraeli Home d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The new administration, which took office <date when="1852-02-27">27 Feb.</date>, included Lord Derby, prime minister and first lord of the treasury; Disraeli, chancellor of the exchequer and leader of the House of Commons; James Howard Harris (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889-00-00">89</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12395"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 3rd earl of Malmesbury was foreign sec., not Stratford Canning (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">1880</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4558"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), who had been ambassador at Constantinople and was soon to be created 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe.</note> of Disraeli&#x2019;s coming in nobody seems to make a doubt; &#x201C;if not Home Sec<hi rend="italic">y</hi>, then perhaps even Board of Controul&#x201C; (which means King of India for the time)&#x2014; &#x2014; I must say, Here is a Stump-Orator who has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> gone to the wrong market with his beggarly &#x201C;Ol&#x2019; Cloe&#x201C; dyed new! Such are <hi rend="italic">our</hi> portents. &#x201C;It is the hour and the power of <hi rend="italic">Darkness</hi>,&#x201C; as Abbot Samson said: &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">videat Altissimus</hi></foreign> [Let the Most High look on it].&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samson (<date when="1135-00-00">1135</date>&#x2013;<date when="1211-00-00">1211</date>), abbot of Bury St. Edmunds, central figure of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present.</hi> For the quotation, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 10:114.</note> Amen.</p>
<p>I still keep reading ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Frederic the Great,&#x2014;dull and dreadful Books (<hi rend="italic">Voigt</hi> on the <foreign>Teutsch Ritterthum</foreign> [Teutonic knighthood], <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> fearful volumes;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johannes Voigt, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte Preussens</hi>, 9 vols.

It has at any rate the advantage of keeping me <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, and busy in tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> with many problems and inquiries.&#x2014;I am at the bottom of my sheet, and must suddenly draw bridle.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>If it be as cold at Thornhill today as it is here at Chelsea, you will give me some credit for having preserved my recollections of old Mary unfrozen with all the rest of my body and soul.&#x2014; I believe it is about the time for transmitting her money&#x2014;at all events tomorrow is the 25<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x2014;a sad anniversary for old Mary<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mills; and the anniversary of JWC&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s death.</note> as well as for me. and which naturally brings her into my mind. with an apprehension of her being left a day without something in hand&#x2014;that is something in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> hands&#x2014;</p>
<p>I send an order on the Bank this time&#x2014;which will save me a journey to the post office here&#x2014; You have a Bank at Thornhill? I dont know if you are aware that my Cousin Helen<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh.</note> has been very ill again&#x2014; That enlargement which my <pb id="pg-27-53" n="27:53"/>Brother in law <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have to be nothing more serious than some inflation of the stomach from indigestion has now declared itself the Liverpool D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> say to be dropsey <hi rend="italic">in the womb</hi>&#x2014; I had always understood this malady to be incurable and very painful. Nevertheless her D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ellison,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Liverpool.</note> says he has known several cases of <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> cure!&#x2014; How it will be God only knows, but I have little hope. nor any of perfect cure for <hi rend="italic">her.</hi> tho&#x2019; I put the best face I can on the matter to the others&#x2014; My poor Uncle is kept quite ignorant of their new view of her disorder&#x2014;as every thing that <hi rend="italic">agitates</hi> him brings on <hi rend="italic">a fit</hi></p>
<p>It is very unfortunate that I am so far away from them&#x2014;afflicted as that once merry household has got to be&#x2014;</p>
<p>For myself I keep on foot in spite of the cold, and am certainly growing stronger as I grow older&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C too I think has been really a little healthier since his sojourn at Malvern&#x2014;both of us take a cold bath the first thing on getting up whatever the temperature; and to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I attribute my successful defiance of the frost this winter&#x2014; Nero is best of all&#x2014;and has not been stolen for nearly a twelmonth&#x2014;he continues to engross all my <hi rend="italic">superfluous</hi> affections&#x2014;tho I trust I dont make such a fool of myself as poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mundell used to do.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491231-JWC-MR-01"><sic>24:319</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1849-12-31">31 Dec. 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Is your Husband much relieved by having got a partner? my Father used to find that the patients would never accept the Partner if they could possibly get himself</p>
<p>I want you to do something for me next Autumn if we be all alive&#x2014;to employ some old woman or children to gather me <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the cranberries of the neighbourhood&#x2014;that I may preserve them&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C brought me about a tumblerful from Scotsbrig and I preserved them and the success they have had was very conspicuous&#x2014;</p>

<p>No news from Chelsea today, not a word of news; only a salutation to you, and a blessing for the sunday morning, as you look out upon the snowdrops and green buds and prophecies of coming Spring. Really if the everlasting powers of this Universe, which do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> fail or lie to us, did not send us some good news, I know not where we should seek them at present: for on the Earth with its palavers and fatuities all seems to my afflicted sense to be sinking <pb id="pg-27-54" n="27:54"/>more and more into universal vileness and wretchedness,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">worthy</hi> to be governed by a &#x201C;Talking-King from Houndsditch&#x201C;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning Disraeli. Houndsditch, where Jewish old-clothes dealers lived, is part of the East End of London; TC used it to stand for outdated Old Testament ideas.</note> and that is saying much! But, from the Pope of Rome and Archbishop of Lambeth,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Official London residence of the archbishops of Canterbury.</note> down to friend Thiers, Disraeli of the Exchequer, and Nero of N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 5 (who was out with me this morning in a very dirty state), the world looks not a little unbeautiful at present; and many things are very unworshipful indeed. Alas, alas! But let us be patient too. The beggarliest mass of yellow cabbage-leaves in the &#x201C;garden&#x201C; they call <hi rend="italic">Covent</hi>-Garden<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chief London market for fresh produce and flowers.</note>&#x2014;well, that too will get itself cleared off by sure scavengers; and indeed I think I know a certain <hi rend="small-caps">fire</hi> that will be the brighter for it, and will rid us of it all, one day!

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1852-02-11">11 Feb.</date></note> came to hand in good hour, just when I had begun to fret myself with some anxieties lest the very thrifty address, &#x201C;Bonn,&#x201C; without even a &#x201C;Preussen&#x201C; superadded, might not have quite sufficed to find you. Many thanks for all your good deeds, and good intentions; both of which I mean to turn diligently to profit on this occasion.</p>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">Stieler</hi> maps, since you have been so good as get them for me, will fit very well as supplement to the <hi rend="italic">Reymanns</hi> (which have never yet arrived, but are promised now, not very credibly, for &#x201C;tomorrow&#x201C;): I have seen <hi rend="italic">Stieler&#x2019;s</hi> map, and could easily discern it was far better than any other yet known to me. B&#xfc;sching&#x2019;s Book, tho&#x2019; I know not well what to expect from it, shall be welcome to me since you have it: I went to the <hi rend="italic">Museum</hi>, and with difficulty dug out a copy of B&#xfc;sching&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Erdbeschreibung</hi> [geography], intending to see <pb id="pg-27-56" n="27:56"/>what was in it of possible value; but, alas, owing to mistakes and confusions, it was two hours before I actually got sight of the little brown monster, and before I had done admiring the outside of it (dumpy, dowdy, dirty, with its <foreign><hi rend="italic">B&#xE4;nde</hi></foreign> [bindings] and sub-<foreign>B&#xE4;nde</foreign> and sub-sub ditto), the bell rang, and we had to march for home again!&#x2014; My trust in B&#xfc;sching, however, is so great that I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> gladly give three times your sum of 4/6 for a legible Copy of his Erdbeschreibung, if such could be met with. Meanwhile, your copy of the subdivision <hi rend="italic">Deutschland</hi> will, with the maps, probably serve all my purposes. A <hi rend="italic">Tour in Silesia</hi> by Adams the subsequent American President, done about <date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>, a very sober, slight but not quite empty volume, is the best thing I have yet fallen in with on that subject.&#x2014; &#x2014; B&#xfc;sching has a Book of <hi rend="italic">Biographies</hi>, Count Lyner,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. F. B&#xfc;sching, <hi rend="italic">Beytr&#xE4;ge zu der Lebensgeschichte denkw&#xfc;rdiger Personen, insonderheit gelehrter M&#xE4;nner</hi>, 6 pts. (Halle, <date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1789-00-00">89</date>); see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 14:30&#x2013;32. Count Roque Friedrich Lynar (<date when="1708-00-00">1708</date>&#x2013;<date when="1781-00-00">81</date>), German writer and diplomat; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 15:96.</note> &#x26;c, Frederic the Great, and <hi rend="italic">Himself</hi>, which I glanced over at the Museum, and decided to buy:&#x2014;this, however, you are not to interfere with; W<hi rend="italic">ms</hi> &#x26; Norgate will do me this and various similar commissions, all in one, so soon as I have sacked them all together, and fairly reduced them into one. <hi rend="italic">Marwitz</hi> is in the shops here:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich August Ludwig von der Marwitz, <hi rend="italic">Aus dem Nachlasse F. A. L.&#x2019;s von der Marwitz auf Friedersdorf</hi>, 2 vols. (Berlin, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>), or possibly <hi rend="italic">Die Zaumung mit der Kandare. Aus dem Nachlasse F. A. Ludwig&#x2019;s von der Marwitz &#x2026; Mit &#x2026; Tafeln</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>).</note> I mean to be in it about the end of this week, so soon as I have done with <hi rend="italic">Zimmermann</hi> &#x26;c.</p>
<p>Now, as to send<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> me these Stieler maps &#x26;c, I have consulted W<hi rend="italic">ms</hi> &#x26; N<hi rend="italic">te;</hi> and find that the proper route will be by <hi rend="italic">Rudolf Hartmann Bookseller in Leipzig</hi> (according to the enclosed Memorandum), who sends a Parcel hither &#x201C;once a fortnight at least.&#x201C; Any Bookseller in Bonn, they say, knows him, and is likely to be often sending parcels to him. <hi rend="italic">Failing</hi> such, there is the route of such Pickfords as you have, by steam or otherwise: I think if you address the Parcel to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> (a paper-<hi rend="italic">strap</hi> round it with my address), then <hi rend="italic">cover</hi> it with the address W. and N. <hi rend="italic">care</hi> of Hartmann, and frank it to Leipzig,&#x2014;that will be a sure and swift method for this or similar parcels. Our <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> on <hi rend="italic">Prussian</hi> Books, it seems, is quite trifling, and the Norgates are quite used to carry parcels of that nature, and get paid for these according to the trouble given.</p>
<p>I really ought to be ashamed for laying so much small bother at your door; nevertheless I am not, but will go on, nothing doubting. Farther, then, there is an <hi rend="italic">Archenholz&#x2019;s Kleine Historische Schriften 2 B</hi>de (Berlin, <date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>), which professes or appears to contain some &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Gem&#xE4;lde der Preussischen Armee</hi></foreign> [paintings of the Prussian army]&#x201C;: this, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is likely to be at once attainable in your Public Libraries, I want you to glance at for me;&#x2014;and if you find it to contain any such <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gem&#xE4;lde</hi></foreign>, to buy it for me, if there is a copy <pb id="pg-27-57" n="27:57"/>attainable; or at least to report that it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be bought. This, and other monies, beginning with the above-said <hi rend="italic">franco</hi> to Leipzig, I must insist on having marked against me (otherwise I really cannot apply again): attend to that, please;&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">send</hi> the Copy of Archenholz at once, if there is one. I know not what your resources in Bonn, for old Books, are; and Leipzig, as you see, is always accessible to me: but of course if you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> reach out your hand and get me any of these Books I have to buy (B&#xfc;sching&#x2019;s Biographies, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Beytr&#xE4;ge</hi>&#x201C; or whatever he calls it), of course I shall be very glad to receive them straightway along with my <hi rend="italic">Stieler:</hi>&#x2014;and you can easily keep an <hi rend="italic">account</hi> of what you pay for me (till the day of meeting, which we will hope is not so very distant); as indeed you are hereby charged to do at any rate; beginning with that <hi rend="italic">franco</hi> to Leipzig spoken of above. And this is all the immediate bother that I have to lay upon you: but nobody knows how much more will come!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Can anybody tell you what is the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Anekdoten</hi> Sam̅lung&#x201C; ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Fr<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Great, published at Berlin directly after his death?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520202-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1852-02-02">2 Feb.</date></ref></note> Zimmermann in <date when="1787-00-00">1787</date> refers to it as worthy of credit; &#x201C;done by a Lady of rank&#x201C;; and cites, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Anekdoten</hi> VI&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Heft</hi> or volume)?

The rather as it remains quite unlikely that I shall ever <hi rend="italic">write</hi> a word about Friedrich; and all this, to me and my friends, is likely to be a mere hunting of plovers, and to end in nothing but the exercise it gives us!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Well, we have got into Spring again, with its crowded streets, parliamentary babble,&#x2014;changes of ministry, and changes of weather; not of a very <hi rend="italic">summer</hi> character as yet, either of these! All men <hi rend="italic">laugh</hi> hitherto at the new mistry,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> with Disraeli for chanchellor<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> King of the Moneybags; but to me it gives no laughter, only gloomy thoughts (when I attend to it at all), as a Belshazzar Handwriting on the wall!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Dan. 5:5&#x2013;29.</note> When once the Stump-Orator is actually Sovereign of England, there will be strange sights here as elsewhere! But we cannot help it; and must not too much mind it. I think sometimes of running over to some nice Island on the Baltic (say Tycho Brahe&#x2019;s,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hven, off SW coast of Sweden, where the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (<date when="1546-00-00">1546</date>&#x2013;<date when="1601-00-00">1601</date>) had his observatory.</note> with excursions to Silesia, to Berlin), and leaving this foul puddle to settle itself here a little! But this is a <pb id="pg-27-58" n="27:58"/>dead secret: say nothing of it!&#x2014; Here has a fool come in, &#x201C;from Brighton on purpose,&#x201C; with a malison on him!&#x2014;and I must break off with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> another word.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>If you are to go on Friday, there is not a moment for me to lose!&#x2014; I am sorry my pen is so bad; which is a great aggravation to my other drawbacks, hastes and confusions.</p>
<p>We are going on here in the old way; the <hi rend="italic">weather</hi> (as is natural) getting daily better, tho&#x2019; still very cold. Yesterday I <hi rend="italic">signed</hi>, with Jane, two Stamped Papers, copies of a kind of <hi rend="italic">Lease</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Adamson sent me: that, I suppose, is the winding-up of the &#x2019;Puttoch business. We got your Note from Moffat; it is our only news from Annandale. Jane is much alarmed ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> poor Cousin Helen, also ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> her uncle: for Helen she agrees with me in recommending <hi rend="italic">Malvern</hi> as the best <hi rend="italic">medical</hi> outlook; but it seems there can be nothing done in it at present,&#x2014;nothing till the Liverpool Doctors have shot <hi rend="italic">their</hi> bolt; which probably will yield small benefit, I think. If poor Helen have, as seems to be agreed upon, <hi rend="italic">such</hi> an internal malady, one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> fancy there c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> no reasonable hope of curing it exist except in <hi rend="italic">general regimen</hi>, by which alone she seems to have benefited hitherto? But for the present there can no more be said, from this quarter.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-59" n="27:59"/>I have been twice at the Museum looking out for <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi> Books,&#x2014;that I might examine them a little, and see whether they were worth <hi rend="italic">buying.</hi> In that horrible shop I of course wish to read as <hi rend="italic">little</hi> as can be made to serve. Watts attended me as before; obliging, skilful, ugly and ardent as ever: his stock he flattered himself was much better than I found it on that head; but we shall get something out of it too.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have got a rather curious new German Book upon Naples and <hi rend="italic">Masaniello</hi> (chiefly) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> often made me remember you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520207-TC-AVR-01"><sic>TC-AR</sic><corr>TC to AVR</corr>, <date when="1852-02-07">7 Feb.</date></ref> John had been in Naples in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320522-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:160</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-05-22">22 May 1832</date></corr></ref>) when TC encouraged him to find out more about the &#x201C;wondrous Masaniello.&#x201C;</note> To one who knows the streets edifices &#x26;c the thing may be readabler: I mean to send it you to Scotsb<hi rend="italic">g</hi> the day after tomorrow, along with my Mother&#x2019;s Magazine.</p>
<p>Poor Tom Holcroft appears to have returned from India, and to have died here some 4 weeks ago! My first hint of it was from the <hi rend="italic">Willis</hi>, which I send today, but from other sources too I find it is even he.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Holcroft, &#x201C;formerly secretary of Asiatic Society,&#x201C; d. <date when="1852-02-06">6 Feb.</date> at 37 Woburn Pl.; <hi rend="italic">Willis&#x2019;s Current Notes.</hi> See also <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510101-TC-JAC-01"><sic>26:4</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1851-01-01">1 Jan. 1851</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>

Now, it appears, you are coming nearer us again; for which in spite of the trouble it will cost you, I confess myself not sorry.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I told Williams and Norgate to send you a new Prussian Book (Memoirs of <hi rend="italic">Marwitz</hi>, vol. I) in time for next Committee Meeting. Pray offer it to the Committee as a work of value on that subject of Prussian History: if they will not have it, I must buy it myself.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>I think it is almost two weeks since I have written to Scotsbrig; but in the interim I believe there has been no day in which you were not often in my memory. How is my poor Mother, in the cold weather! This is a continual inquiry with me. Alas, I can do you no good at all; and would so gladly do you some!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Dr, if he have kept his word, will be on the return to you this very day: he was to leave Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x201C;on Friday,&#x201C; as he wrote;&#x2014;I have had two bits of hurried words from him since he left Scotsbrig; in both of which he reports favourably of your condition of affairs: I hope he will, directly on his return, let me know more minutely how matters go.</p>
<p>We have had the fiercest weather for some time; poisonously cold, especially at night and morning when the Sun is sunk in his smoky London vapours: during the day he gets out for a few hours, and gives us bright <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> of the advancing season; the skies have a look of spring; but as yet there is little sign of it on the fields and trees, and poor shivering human creatures all buckled up in shawls and wool wrappages! As I get into cold water every morning, and then directly after run out to walk, it is very disagreeable, upon the fingers especially. The dog Nero alone seems to enjoy his walk thro&#x2019; the lanes, and runs barking about in the hope of catching a sparrow. He never catches one;&#x2014;and brings me in mind of many other creatures, of myself among others, in that respect!&#x2014; &#x2014;Jane keeps well on her feet, in <pb id="pg-27-62" n="27:62"/>spite of the cold; I myself too am always fully better than usual, this year; and so our complaint of the weather should not be a very deep one, after all. I am still busy <supplied>[. &#x2026; ]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Page missing; remainder written at top of first page.</note></p>

<p>The weather here is venomously cold, night and morning; but I hope and believe you have less of that frozen fog in which the sun so often drowns himself here: in the crown of the day we too get bright skies, and the whole world promises to become young for us one other time.

<p>I still keep <foreign><hi rend="italic">perdu</hi></foreign> [hidden] as much as possible; reading, &#x201C;burning my own smoke,&#x201C;&#x2014;riding sometimes in the bright afternoon for a couple of hours.

Nothing has thrown me off since the treacherous &#x201C;Pluck,&#x201C; or &#x201C;Patience,&#x201C; did: my horse is a very roe for swiftness and for gentleness; but the temperature is still <hi rend="italic">bad;</hi> and my lonely rides are never much of a pleasure to me.

<p>I had a thousand things to say; but, as usual, not one of them has been got said. All is so waste, so hurried and confused, within me and around me, about this time!

<salute>Dear Browning,</salute>
<p>Above a fortnight ago I received your Letter, and the little <hi rend="italic">Shelley</hi> Book along with;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley. With an Introductory Essay;</hi> see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511010-TC-RB-01"><sic>26:202</sic><corr>TC to RB, <date when="1851-10-10">10 Oct. 1851</date></corr></ref>. The letters were spurious and the vol. suppressed soon after pbn.</note> a most pleasant pair of objects, to which, having read the Book too the very night it arrived, I meant to answer on the morrow. Thanks were heartily ready, and a clear enough opinion which has not altered since: but, by some chance or other, the morrow came to be preoccupied, and then the next morrow and the next,&#x2014;and the answer up to this moment you perceive, has never got out of the future tense. Such are the whirlings, cross-currents and regurgitations of this mad Gulf-Stream of an element: one&#x2019;s time, unless one fight for every minute of it, all goes devoured and annihilated here; to get any work at all out of one&#x2019;s life here, I often say, one has to snatch it like furniture from a house on fire;&#x2014;and the soul of man is not always equal to feats of that kind! Alas, alas, the mud-gods are indeed very strong, in most places at present, and in this place I should say beyond most!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I liked the Essay extremely well indeed: a solid, well-wrought massive manful bit of discourse; and interesting to me, over and above, as the first bit of <hi rend="italic">prose</hi> I had ever seen from you;&#x2014;I hope only the first of very many. You do not know how cheering to me the authentic sound of a <hi rend="italic">human</hi> voice is! I get so little except <hi rend="italic">ape</hi>-voices; the whole universe filled with one wide tempestuous cackle, which has neither depth nor sense, nor any kind of truth or nobleness in it: O Heaven, one feels as if it were too bad; as if the temptation were, to burst into tears, and sit down and weep till one died! I cannot now, in late years, laugh at such a phenomenon; oftenest it makes me inexpressibly sad,&#x2014;as is very natural if one look at the <hi rend="italic">whence</hi> and the inevitable <hi rend="italic">whitherward;</hi>&#x2014;wherefore in general I rather try to get out of it altogether, quite away from the beggarly sound of it; and to sit solitary, in company rather with the dumb Chaos than with the talking one. This Essay of yours, and another little word by Emerson are the only new things I have read with real pleasure for a great while past. I agree with what you say of Shelley&#x2019;s moralities and spiritual <pb id="pg-27-65" n="27:65"/>position; I honour and respect the weighty estimate you have formed of the Poetic Art; and I admire very much the grave expressiveness of Style (a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> too elaborate here and there), and the dignified tone, in which you manage to deliver yourself on all that.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Browning wrote in his intro., now called &#x201C;Essay on Shelley,&#x201C; &#x201C;I concede that the unmistakeable quality of the verse would be evidence enough, under usual circumstances, not only of the kind and degree of the intellectual but of the moral constitution of Shelley: the whole personality of the poet shining forward from the poems, without much need of going further to seek it. The &#x2018;Remains&#x2019; &#x2026; present us with the complete enginery of a poet, as signal in the excellence of its several adaptitudes as transcendent in the combination of effects,&#x2014;examples, in fact, of the whole poet&#x2019;s function of beholding with an understanding keenness the universe, nature and man, in their actual state of perfection in imperfection,&#x2014; &#x2026; the whole poet&#x2019;s virtue &#x2026; of looking higher than any manifestation yet made of both beauty and good, in order to suggest from the utmost actual realisation of the one a corresponding capability in the other. &#x2026; &#x2014;so drawing out, lifting up, and assimilating this ideal of a future man, thus descried as possible, to the present reality of the poet&#x2019;s soul already arrived at the higher state of development, and still aspirant to elevate and extend itself in conformity with its still-improving perceptions of, no longer the eventual Human, but the actual Divine&#x201C; (Robert Browning, ed. Roma A. King and others [Waco, Texas, <date when="1981-00-00">1981</date>] 5:142&#x2013;43).</note></p>
<p>The Letters themselves are very innocent and clear; and deserve printing, with such a name attached to them;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Browning argued that Shelley&#x2019;s life had been misrepresented and that new biographical information, such as the letters, gave grounds for a new estimate of the man and poet: &#x201C;There existed from the beginning &#x2026; certain charges against his private character and life, which, if substantiated to their whole breadth, would materially disturb, I do not attempt to deny, our reception and enjoyment of his works, however wonderful the artistic qualities of these.&#x201C;</note> but it is not they that I care for on the present occasion. In fact I am not sure but you would excommunicate me,&#x2014;at least lay me under the &#x201C;lesser sentence,&#x201C; for a time,&#x2014;if I told you all I thought of Shelley! Poor soul, he has always seemed to me an extremely weak creature, and lamentable much more than admirable. Weak in genius, weak in character (for these two always go together); a poor thin, spasmodic, hectic, shrill and pallid being;&#x2014;one of those unfortunates, of whom I often speak, to whom the &#x201C;talent of <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>,&#x201C; first of all, has been denied. The speech of such is never good for much. Poor Shelley, there is something void and Hades-like in the whole inner world of him; his universe is all vacant azure, hung with a few frosty mournful if beautiful stars; the very voice of him (his style &#x26;c), shrill, shrieky, to my ear has too much of the <hi rend="italic">ghost!</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC told William Allingham in <date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>, &#x201C;Shelley had not the least poetic faculty. I never could read anything he wrote. It was all a shriek merely,&#x201C; and he added, &#x201C;Browning came on my birthday and talked loud. He agreed with me about Shelley and his poetry&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">William Allingham, A Diary</hi>, ed. H. Allingham and D. Radford, 241&#x2013;42).</note>&#x2014; In a word, it is not with Shelley, but with Shelley&#x2019;s Commentator that I take up my quarters at all: and to this latter I will say with emphasis, Give us some more <pb id="pg-27-66" n="27:66"/>of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> writing, my friend; we decidedly need a man or two like you, if we could get them! Seriously, dear Browning, you must at last gird up your loins<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 38:3.</note> again; and give us a right stroke of work:&#x2014;I do not wish to hurry you; far the contrary: but I remind you of what is expected; and say with what joy I for one will see it arrive.&#x2014; Nor do I restrict you to Prose, in spite of all I have said and still say: Prose or Poetry, either of them you can master; and we will wait for you with welcome in whatever form your own <hi rend="italic">Daimon</hi> bids. Only see that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> does bid it; and then go with your best speed;&#x2014;and on the whole forgive, at any rate, these importunities, which I feel to partake much of the nature of impertinence, if you did not kindly interpret them.</p>
<p>About the time your Letter came, or shortly before it, I had given a Card of introduction to a certain M. Mont&#xE9;gut of the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes;</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Baptiste Joseph Emile Mont&#xE9;gut, on the staff of the <hi rend="italic">Revue</hi>.</note> which document I left him free to present or suppress, and know not which he has done. If he have done the former, pray understand that I do not know him in the flesh at all; that I only know him as a Writer on English things in that <hi rend="italic">R&#xE9;vue;</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> writer, in particular, of an Essay on myself some 2 or 3 years ago, which seemed to argue a very ingenuous and rather able and amiable man. If on sight you don&#x2019;t like him,&#x2014;act accordingly without respect of me; who indeed am not cognisant of him beyond what I say, nor concerned in him except as a general son of Adam. That is the real truth; and so enough of that.</p>
<p>How is poor Mrs Browning in this fierce weather? I hardly remember a viler temperature than we have <foreign>[had]</foreign><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> for ten days back: grim frozen fog, except a few hours about noon; whirlpools of frosty dust, and a wind direct from Nova Zembla.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Novaya Zemlya; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300806-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:129</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-08-06">6 Aug. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> However, it will end soon; and Summer come in spite of all this wriggling and Lancashire up-and-downing on the part of Winter.</p>
<p>We have got thro&#x2019; the two first volumes (I read them yesterday) of <hi rend="italic">Marg</hi>t <hi rend="italic">Fuller.</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli</hi>, compiled J.

<salute>My dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I have understood you were about changing, or had already changed, your old Gig into a new,&#x2014;and that the cost, on the whole, was to be &#xa3;12 for that useful operation. I hope you will allow me to bear the half of the adventure; as the Dr, it appears, intends undertaking the other half, this will make a proper finish to the job,&#x2014;and be a real gratification to me. Many are the rides I have had on your conveyances and under your escort; many are the kind services you have done me; unwearied your readiness to help me in any way at all times! I beg you to accept this little remembrance here inclosed;&#x2014;and farther, as I know your tastes in the writing way, I will beg you <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to write about it, or to write at all till you are otherwise disposed so to favour: John will mention that the thing arrives, and that is all that need be said. And long may the new Gig run, and never carry you on any <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> errand, but always on good ones!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wrote to my Mother, a day or two ago: I suppose John came home on Saturday or Friday, as he purposed? Let him write to me when he has gathered <pb id="pg-27-68" n="27:68"/>himself a little. Isabella, I was sorry to hear, is rather weakly this winter: I often think anxiously with myself how my poor Mother and she are getting thro&#x2019; these inclement days! We have blocks of ice lying in the ditches, dust flying about as in the heart of summer: I hope it is better for <hi rend="italic">ploughing</hi> than for my purposes;&#x2014;but in fine it will soon be over, and so we need not complain about it.&#x2014; I go riding often, in fact as often as I like; but it hardly seems to do me so much good as in old days; and it ties up my time terribly for me. In these fierce days, it is hardly possible, with all the jackets and <hi rend="italic">Sagtail</hi> loose wrappages one has, to keep completely warm in riding. The raging <hi rend="italic">uproar</hi> of all roads hereabouts, or almost all, is likewise a drawback. However, I have to admit that of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the outskirts of London this Chelsea (the instant one crosses the river) is close upon the <hi rend="italic">quietest</hi> set of roads;&#x2014;and indeed some of them, beautiful country lanes, are absolutely quiet, and cheer one&#x2019;s heart with the sight of real sky and fields for a few minutes. Add to which, my horse is altogether excellent: swift as a deer, ready for any pace, and (especially now that it has got acquainted with me) altogether innocent, <hi rend="italic">affectionate</hi> even, and cheerily obedient. With which qualities,&#x2014;since, moreover, it <hi rend="italic">costs</hi> me nothing, I ought surely to be content!</p>
<p>I am very busy, reading &#x26;c, always fiddling about, with a tendency to be even in a hurry, and hard up for time; but unfortunately I make small <hi rend="italic">waygate</hi> in comparison! My <hi rend="italic">inside</hi> plagues me much in this and other respects, as it has always done;&#x2014;and, alas, my want of adequate <hi rend="italic">wisdom</hi> to manage that and other difficulties, is a still heavier drawback:&#x2014;however, I fight away, as we all have to do; and hope not to stick quite in the ditch either, but to keep sprawling on so long as the &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">gea</hi></foreign> of life&#x201C; is in me; which is a clear duty for us all.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Dear Brother, I must bid you <foreign>adieu</foreign> at present; but I hope it will not be long till we hear about one another again. My blessings and love to our dear old Mother, to Isabella and the rest. I am&#x2014;ever your affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have had your two Notes; the first came before Jamie&#x2019;s went off but not till after it was sealed: many thanks to you for both. We are much gratified, &#x26; almost as it were surprised, to hear how our good old Mother stands out against the unwholesome weather: there has been nothing equal to it for discomfort, dust, and dry withering cold all this year; and very many are <pb id="pg-27-69" n="27:69"/>driven out of order by it. Here in this house, it has quite cut up the servant Anne for one; who goes about piteously coughing, and has quite lost her very voice for some days past; and indeed now intends, by Jane&#x2019;s counsel, to withdraw from the concern altogether, and take to bed till she recover;&#x2014;which costs Jane herself some considerable bother, getting a substitute, charwoman or other &#x201C;help&#x201C; till the poor soul get round again. tho&#x2019; there must be towards a million working women in this place, and above 30,000 of them, as we often hear, are quite out of work, it seems to be as good as impossible to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> real household service (or indeed I fear any kind of real <hi rend="italic">service</hi>) for money here! I often say, things are hastening towards strange consummations in human society at present! But we must leave all that to find what course it can. Not even the Jew Stump-orator<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Disraeli.</note> can much mend that. With a murrian<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> on it, and on him!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Some people in Manchester have instituted a thing they call &#x201C;Poor-Law Association,&#x201C; intended for getting Paupers set to <hi rend="italic">work.</hi> I wrote them a Letter of encourag<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, gave them a sovereign of subscript<hi rend="italic">n:</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520205-TC-SPLAM-01">TC to <sic>SPLA</sic><corr>SPLAM</corr>, <date when="1852-02-05">5 Feb.</date></ref></note> they printed the Letter (without leave), and defended it from some illnatured dog or other, of whom you might see some glimpse once in the <hi rend="italic">Leader:</hi> they write now that they are so very strong, they are thinking of a public meeting in Manchester, and ask if they &#x201C;may be quite certain&#x201C; of my attending! It will rather seem to myself a strange fact if I &#x201C;attend&#x201C; at this particular junction.</p>
<p>We are much interested about poor your Jamie&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle&#x2019;s son Jamie; &#x201C;poor your&#x201C;: thus in MS.</note> course, and sympathize with the straits he and all of <supplied>[you]</supplied> must be in just now in reference to that. Poor fellow, he has arrived at the striking off of the way, and must <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> the old quiet household road, and seek a new one for himself henceforth. Happily there is endless <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> at his time of life, otherwise the pain would be too hard! I cannot take upon me to advise in such ignorance of the precise state of affairs: but if this George Bell<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> is really (as w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> appear) a good and rational man, whose word and character may be depended on, there certainly seems a great temptation to look in that direction for an outlet. He can explain to you, in some measure, what could be counted on as <hi rend="italic">likely</hi> in that adventure; what he himself could engage for &#x26;c &#x26;c. Jamie&#x2019;s own feelings ought, next, to go for a great deal. He will have to venture out into the world on his own feet at this point; which is a heavy thought for the like of him: but at some point or other he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> to do it, on any hypothesis; and truly, for an <hi rend="italic">Emigrant</hi>, the younger one goes, I fancy, it must be the better. His chagrin and homesickness, poor young creature, will be very hard for him but they will soon get moderated <pb id="pg-27-70" n="27:70"/>too, and disappear in the activities of his new scene; where, for a diligent young fellow, there really seems to lie an honest free and altogether wholesome field of activity. Having fair abilities and an honest steady character, he might no doubt struggle along like others in this crowded scene of ours; but here too, it is undeniable, the difficulties toils and sufferings are manifold, and the confusion gets more and more suffocating! I cannot tell what to advise. I think it must depend most on himself and on G. Bell. We will wish you, with our whole hearts, a <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> decision; and that, I suppose, is all that we can do, or nearly all. If there were anything else we should be very ready too.</p>
<p>I am still tumbling about among Books about Fred<hi rend="italic">k;</hi> getting German maps, nay a Map<hi rend="italic">holder</hi> (of my own invention), and a huge magnifying glass (the size almost of a small <hi rend="italic">brander</hi>) for reading maps with, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> answers very well. As to any <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>, however, I fear there is yet no prospect whatever on my side; and I am often tempted to renounce it all, some good day.&#x2014; &#x2014; We were at Erskine&#x2019;s on Wednesday last to dinner: friendly but confusing, unprofitable, unwholesome even.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>I am thoroughly ashamed of myself, for having let so many days pass over without telling you of the safe arrival of the sweetbriars, and returning you my heartiest thanks for them. I was unusually busy or perhaps I should rather say unusually idle all last week. a succession of <hi rend="italic">callers</hi> every day; and <hi rend="italic">Plays</hi> and parties in the evenings. I had not been to the Theatre for a couple of years, and last week I was at <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Plays besides to a Conjuror&#x2014;gaities never coming single any more than misfortunes! The fact is I have a very interesting <pb id="pg-27-71" n="27:71"/>German Family living near me at present,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the Reichenbachs.</note> who serve me in the room of <hi rend="italic">children</hi> as excuses for going after amusements&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hear often from Maryland Street: Jeanie writes now, Maggie being gone on a visit to Cheltnam for a week or so&#x2014; I suppose she was tired with nursing, poor little thing!&#x2014; Helen continues to be the subject of much <hi rend="italic">discussion</hi> amongst her <hi rend="italic">three</hi> Doctors&#x2014; Oh! if she had just <hi rend="italic">one</hi> good one!&#x2014; They cannot agree about the <hi rend="italic">certainty</hi> of the dropsy in the womb&#x2014;the dropsy on the stomach is quite made out&#x2014;but the other is a <hi rend="italic">certainty</hi> for only D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ellison D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Vose<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> has <hi rend="italic">some</hi> doubt of it and D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> somebody else &#x201C;very great doubt indeed&#x201C;! Meanwhile they are tormenting her with some terribly strong medecine&#x2014;Jeanie says her general health and strength would be very good but for the effects of this medecine.&#x2014; My Uncle continues <hi rend="italic">well</hi>&#x2014; I never understood till I got your last letter that D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell had taken into Banking&#x2014; You said in one letter a good while ago that he would now have less to fatigue him&#x2014;and I could not imagine <hi rend="italic">why</hi>&#x2014;till afterwards I saw in the newspaper that he had taken a Partner&#x2014;but I did not know of the Bank, still&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am very frightened for these sharp frosty winds killing my poor little slips&#x2014; they got quite properly planted <hi rend="italic">right side up</hi>, by an old gardner, the same hour they were taken from the box&#x2014;I would not trust to my own no-skill&#x2014;</p>
<p>Did I ever tell you that I have a beautiful view of Drumlanrig<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Drumlanrig Castle, Dumfriesshire, seat of the duke of Buccleuch.</note> hanging in this room? it was done by Lady Ashburton who showed it me one day as a mere sketch and I wouldnt give it her again&#x2014;I wish some one would do me a sketch of Templand<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s home, nr. Thornhill.</note>&#x2014; Do you know an <hi rend="italic">accomplished</hi> young Lady up to such a thing?</p>
<p>And now goodby&#x2014; I have a sewing-woman in the house today and must seek her work&#x2014; She had an operation for Cancer in the breast <hi rend="italic">five weeks</hi> ago! the <hi rend="italic">third</hi>&#x2014;and there is the poor soul thankful to get a days sewing! two of the operations were performed under cholroform&#x2014;and never felt&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>I duly got your Note; and must plead guilty to the charge of delay in writing. No man, in fact, was ever less <hi rend="italic">inclined</hi> to write, even to those he loved best, than I at this time. My inward affairs are fallen into such an abstruse condition, I am forced to admit myself to the strictest silence, and the profoundest solitude, in regard to them: I do not fancy there is, in the British Empire at present, intrinsically a more lonely soul,&#x2014;and that especially in the most crowded mass of human creatures that there anywhere is under the sun. My way of thinking is so different from that of all the people about me here or elsewhere, my abhorrence of jarring and jargon gets so considerable! I am not so ill off when left well alone, to look facts in the face however ugly they be, and get them gradually sorted by my own poor but sincere endeavours: but all talk, especially all writing&#x2014; And then the scandalous bitter eastwind, and the sunless frozen dust-clouds, have been acting unfavourably on me: in short I have not, except upon a kind of compulsion, written the smallest Note to anybody for many days; that is the fact! &#x201C;Works aye maistly in a place by himsel,&#x201C; as James says!&#x2014; You must be patient with me till I reemerge, get my head above water again, and fall into the speaking category once more. Of my affection at least, whether I write or not, you will do me the justice to entertain <hi rend="italic">no</hi> doubt at any time. And let us pray for the poor monster, that he may get out of his black thunderclouds and bottomless quagmires, into daylight and firm ground again,&#x2014;by and by!</p>
<p>There has been nothing passing here that was of interest to us; tho&#x2019; Ministries have changed &#x26;c &#x26;c. The prevalence of frozen eastwind (the disagreeablest weather I can recollect for a long time, and really unfavourable to health for their skins) was a much more important fact for us. <hi rend="italic">Lady</hi> Derby (the Premier&#x2019;s wife) intends, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> appear, a great turn out in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> way on the last ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> of the month, and has sent me a card among others. I really am not quite sure but I shall go for a few minutes, and see what the &#x201C;scoonerils [scoundrels]&#x201C; are like! But I doubt that is not probable either.&#x2014; Nobody expects much, or fears anything, of this Derby <hi rend="italic">go:</hi> the fact that poor English Toryism is obliged to depend on the <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> of a base Venetian Jew (who has nothing else but a glib tongue, with a brass face and heart) speaks eloquently as to <hi rend="italic">it</hi> and some other things! On the whole, we had better not think of all that; the less we think, the quieter our humour will likely be.</p>
<p>I keep reading still about Frederic the Great of Prussia, but without making almost any true progress towards understanding him or his affairs. Partly I cannot get the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> books here: even when I send for them, at my own <pb id="pg-27-73" n="27:73"/>charges, the <hi rend="italic">delay</hi> is quite overpowering (as experience shews), and before the book arrive, you will have helped yourself otherwise, and fallen out of conceit with it. We sometimes talk of quite lifting anchor and going <hi rend="italic">over</hi> thither (Jane and I) for a six months: but this is <hi rend="italic">quite a secret</hi>, observe. The <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> is, however, I do not care rightly about the subject; do not <hi rend="italic">kindle</hi> readily now about it or any other subject. That is the chief fruit I yet trace of rapidly advancing years,&#x2014;a thing to be looked for, along with worse things which have wonderfully hitherto been spared me, at this stage of my history.</p>
<p>Jane has been a little put upon her mettle this last week: our servant-woman (an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> steady, clockwork kind of elderly person) broke altogether down under the cold weather, lost her voice, seemed like to lose her very life, and finally last saturday, went away to go to bed and try to recover (which she is now doing, we hear). Some tumbling in consequence. At length however all is settled again, on a good basis,&#x2014;active quiet little lass to do the fires, the door, the dishes &#x26;c, and first-rate matron of the neighbourhood who comes in daily two hours to cook:&#x2014;we do really very well indeed, and can let the poor Servant woman take her time in recovering.</p>
<p>Jack writes us this morning; short Letters come pretty frequently from him: our good old Mother is wonderfully well by his account; for the rest they are in some uncertainty about disposing of young Jamie, not knowing well into what line to forward and advise him.&#x2014;</p>
<p>You get <hi rend="italic">the Critic;</hi> and always forward it to John? That is the right way. Unless you would like better that I sent it <hi rend="italic">first</hi> to John, whereby you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be harried or troubled farther with it? Tell me which, if you can remember.&#x2014; And on the whole write again soon, and I will answer perhaps <hi rend="italic">better.</hi> For after all I do not mean to fall quite silent (in spite of the above sad considerations!) and if I write at all, it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be to Sister Jean among the first!&#x2014;<closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Jean.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept my acknowledgements for the kind Gift you have been pleased to send me: two of the prettiest volumes I have seen for a long time;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Among White&#x2019;s recent publications were <hi rend="italic">The Lansdowne Shakespeare</hi>, &#x201C;in an elegant cover &#x2026; or beautifully marbled, calf extra, gilt leaves,&#x201C; and <hi rend="italic">Truths Illustrated by Great Authors</hi>, &#x201C;elegantly bound, gilt edges, illustrated with a beautiful Frontispiece after Raffaelle&#x201C; (advert. in <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1852-02-28">28 Feb.</date>).</note> and <pb id="pg-27-74" n="27:74"/>arriving as if from the skies, without merit of mine;&#x2014;surely I must welcome such a Gift, and am much obliged by all the honour you do me.</p>
<p>Of the Shelley business I had heard nothing except vague distant rumour, till your Pamphlet<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Calumnies of the <hi rend="italic">ATHENAEUM</hi> Journal Exposed</hi> (<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>), addressed to the publisher John Murray who had bought some Byron material from White (afterward shown to be forged), who had also sold at auction spurious letters bought by Edward Moxon. The Shelley forgeries were first exposed in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1852-03-06">6 March</date>, which said that White had sold them, believing them genuine, having bought them from two women. &#x201C;The two women,&#x201C; said the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, &#x201C;would appear to have been like the man in a clergyman&#x2019;s band, but with a lawyer&#x2019;s gown, who brought Pope&#x2019;s letters to Curll.&#x201C; Alexander Pope (<date when="1688-00-00">1688</date>&#x2013;<date when="1744-00-00">1744</date>) pretended that some of his letters were published against his will by the bookseller Edmund Curll (<date when="1675-00-00">1675</date>&#x2013;<date when="1747-00-00">1747</date>).</note> set it in a clear light for me. The silly writer in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> seems to me to have been only hunting for a joke (in the way of <hi rend="italic">duty</hi>, poor soul) when he made that ill-mannered allusion to Curll: nor had I gathered from the Newspaper paragraph, which was all I knew of him or it, that even he intended to convey any imputation against your procedure in the business, or fix the smallest shadow of suspicion on you:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Taking note of White&#x2019;s pamphlet, the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1852-03-20">20 March</date>, said that it &#x201C;made no charge against Mr. White; and if he found in the facts of that narrative good reason why he should put himself on his defence,&#x2014;he found it for himself.&#x201C;</note> but certainly, if he did, it is now annihilated, and the whole matter, down to the bottom of it, is rendered transparent for those who have curiosity in such things. The ambiguous &#x201C;Mr Byron,&#x201C; of whom I had heard nothing for several years, proves to be a very singular fellow; and has struck out a filial relation of the most unexampled kind!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maj. George Gordon Byron, an imposter claiming to be Lord Byron&#x2019;s natural son; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460503-TC-JAC-01"><sic>20:186</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1846-05-03">3 May 1846</date></corr></ref>. White was told that some of the Byron papers he had bought had been connected with the major.</note> We will thank him for <hi rend="italic">Browning&#x2019;s Essay</hi>,&#x2014;till the Treadmill or Gallows have time to do its duty:&#x2014;that is likely to be all the benefit we reap from your and other people&#x2019;s troubles and losses by him. The <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> themselves, if never so genuine, seemed to me intrinsically to have no value whatever.</p>
<p>All you say of the condition of Periodical Criticism, and the thing men worship in these times by the name of &#x201C;The Press,&#x201C; I believe to be too true: indeed there are many reasons in the nature of things why this department of our affairs must, as it expands rapidly in superficies, dwindle about as rapidly in depth and in every sort of worth,&#x2014;why, in short, the &#x201C;Printed Talk&#x201C; of the Public should sink daily more and more to the level of its <hi rend="italic">spoken</hi> Talk, the proper definition of which has never been very high! As time is precious, and <pb id="pg-27-75" n="27:75"/>as Ragfair or the Knackers yard is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the eligible place to loiter in, I suppose there are many serious persons who have fallen on the one course open in regard to all that, namely the negative one, to read next to nothing of it,&#x2014;which plan, I confess, is mine, this long while back!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Your object in this new Periodical is beyond question laudable; and, perhaps nobody alive would rejoice more to see it effectuated than myself: but of that result, I must frankly own to you, I can be by no means sanguine; nor in fact, without <hi rend="italic">immense</hi> expenditures of labour, money-capital, patience, talent, and every species of human virtue and acquirement, is success so much as conceivable to me. And for myself,&#x2014;in spite of the great honour you do me, of which you may be assured I am very sensible,&#x2014;it is at once clear that I cannot undertake any active function in the business, nor indeed, except by wishes which are good for nothing, assist you in it at all. This is the sad truth, essentially and even vitally coherent with my actual way of life; and I owe it to your frankness, and to my respect for Mr Costello<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Dudley Costello (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6379"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), journalist and painter. White&#x2019;s plans for a new periodical were evidently unrealized.</note> and the other Gentlemen, to say so with all distinctness and without any delay.</p>
<p>If, on <hi rend="italic">those</hi> terms, you care to walk so far as Chelsea for the purpose of talking farther to me on this subject (which, however, I should rather, in prudence, advise you to abandon), you may find <hi rend="italic">me</hi> accessible almost any day from half past 2 to 3 p.m.,&#x2014;and tho&#x2019;, alas, I cannot promise you the smallest useful counsel or practical furtherance, you shall decidedly have my regret for the want of it.</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I await your orders as to the Books; indeed I could not get those I intended for Jean, the answer was, they were already sold. If you give me a list (and mention as far as you can in what shelf, compartment or repository the Books are to be sought), I will endeavour to be exact with them so far as possible.&#x2014; &#x2014; No word has yet come of Alick&#x2019;s Canadian Draught (I mean the Adamson transaction, intended as a gift to little Jane): it is now long beyond the time I counted on, and nothing but a <hi rend="italic">newspaper</hi> was requested, which still does not come: however, I suppose we shall find it all right at last, and so I say nothing (except this to you).</p>
<p>I am reading Ranke&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Preussische Geschichte</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leopold von Ranke, <hi rend="italic">Neun B&#xfc;cher preussischer Geschichte</hi>, 3 vols.

I get on in it very slowly, too; and have innumerable <hi rend="italic">reverses</hi> and impediments, in general, in this course of mine. Not to say that I really still do not care very much about Frederic; tho&#x2019; I think him a very pretty man, a bit of excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> stuff, and well worth painting <hi rend="italic">if one had opportunity and call. <foreign>Aus dem wird</foreign></hi>&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">was</hi></foreign> [Of this will come&#x2014;what]? <foreign>Eheu!</foreign></p>

Stanley, Countess of Airlie.</note> &#x201C;wished to know.&#x201C; Twistleton, the young Sterling girls with Anth<hi rend="italic">y</hi> and perhaps some other attended as witnesses: Erskine was very amiable; the young Lady very pretty; it all went off happily, and left me to Books again.&#x2014; Our weather does not mend much, yet summer is irresistibly advancing; and I suppose, it is excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for plougher and sower: we have no <hi rend="italic">sun</hi>, and the air is dusty to the last degree of dirtiness! I long much for rain.&#x2014; &#x2014; Alas, alas, here is Helps come, here is &#x26;c &#x26;c: not room for a word more!&#x2014; How is my good old Mother?

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It would give me great pleasure to be of any use in developing into activity the beneficent ideas you have, and thereby doing a transcendent service to the world withal: but you are too generous to take it ill of me if I still answer that for me and my help there appears no possibility in such a direction, and that, too clearly, I can do nothing in it at all,&#x2014;beyond wishing heartily well to it, if that is to do anything.</p>
<p>Your purposes seem high and excellent; many features, too, of a delicate and pious intelligence I can discern in what you say: but to myself the outcome seems entirely impracticable; and, without presuming to criticise what you or others may find good to attempt in such a matter, I can very clearly answer that for me, with my actual habits and now inveterate ways of thinking, there is really no firm place to stand on, no credible goal to aim at, in such a project, and in a word no work that I can do in it.</p>
<p>Your project seems to me to labour under that fatal error of aiming at &#x201C;a Society which is to do the work of Society itself&#x201C;: Society, it seems to me, exists simply, and has existed simply, in virtue of doing better or worse these very functions you contemplate for this new Association of private citizens: if such an Association did actually get into victorious activity, and do the work you cut out for it, were not <hi rend="italic">this</hi> the real Church and the real State, the real King and the real Priest, and all else a superfluity and imposture?&#x2014; I do not the least contemplate that any such Association could get into action,&#x2014;unless delivering Orations and paying Subscriptions be accounted &#x201C;action&#x201C;:&#x2014;and for the improvement of the old already extant Church and State I am forced to look towards quite other agencies.</p>
<p>Probably you will do well, as you contemplate, to speak out what thoughts are labouring in you, on these subjects; so far as you have attained a clear profound and modest conviction, you have a real call to speak: and the answer you get will elucidate in many ways what steps are next to be taken. As to me I can feel no tendency whatever towards such &#x201C;Associations&#x201C; as are alone possible in the present state of men&#x2019;s minds; and am continually reminding myself, &#x201C;The good citizen&#x2019;s first duty is that of staying well at home,&#x2014;managing wisely his own affairs, while so much madness is abroad.&#x201C;</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter is very kind and good; and I know very well, by old experience of my own, what it means.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin had written to TC in <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date> about his belief that on two important occasions Cromwell had acted untruthfully; for TC&#x2019;s answer, see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18501229-TC-HL-01"><sic>25:322</sic><corr>TC to HL, <date when="1850-12-29">29 Dec. 1850</date></corr></ref>. &#x201C;Two years after this,&#x201C; Larkin said, &#x201C;the conviction had become very strong in me that it had hardly been seemly to have written to a man to whom I owed so much in a way that could possibly be construed into a rebuke; and I resolved to write one more brief letter, to clear my own conscience &#x2026; and to be entirely frank. After expressing my heartfelt gratitude to him for what he had taught me, and for the contentment of mind to which I had thus been restored, I said that, &#x2018;next to my sovereign Lord and Master Jesus Christ,&#x2019; it was to him that I was indebted&#x201C; (&#x201C;Carlyle&#x201C; 17).</note> In a world so full of contradiction and confusion, I may honestly accept your loyal feeling towards me with thanks and satisfaction; and to yourself also it signifies much that you have such feelings, and have found some course for them, in days like ours. Persist in that disposition, whatever hindrances occur, so long as you can.</p>
<p>If I have ever taught you any truth, let me offer or reiterate this one advice about it, That you be earnest, without delay, to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it; and not at all earnest to <hi rend="italic">say</hi> it,&#x2014;but rather careful <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to say it, till the irresistible necessity arrive. If such necessity never arrive, then understand that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are all the richer; to have the thing still circulating in your blood and life and have not thrown it out of you, it or any part of <supplied>[it,]</supplied> by speech. This is truer than perhaps you think <supplied>[at]</supplied> present; you will see it better by and by. Of all the devouring Molochs to which souls &#x201C;pass thro&#x2019; the fire,&#x201C;&#x2014;and are burnt, too truly, into phantasmal inanity and <hi rend="italic">death</hi>-in-life,&#x2014;there is none comparable, in horrible efficiency and all-destructiveness, to the Eloquence Moloch (called &#x201C;Literature,&#x201C; &#x201C;Stump Oratory&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c) who stands crowned as a god among these poor bankrupt generations! &#x201C;Do, with all thy might, what thy hand findeth to do&#x201C;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi> 24:2&#x2013;3. Larkin said that &#x201C;that letter finally decided for me that literature was not a possibility to which I could ever look, without some far more urgent call than any I had yet been conscious of&#x201C; (&#x201C;Carlyle&#x201C; 17).</note> speak of the same only to the infinitesimal few,&#x2014;nay oftenest to nobody, not even to thyself!&#x2014;</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many wishes and regards, I remain (sorely short of <hi rend="italic">time</hi> for most part),</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your second Note has come this morning. The Bunsens, as you know, sent no Books; nor did I myself succeed in gathering any. However, the Box, one way and other, is filled: after a severe tussle (for I could get no help for <hi rend="italic">money</hi>, and did not ask it for love), the miscellany of tagraggeries is all stuffed in; the Box nailed and corded, standing at my door in expectation of the Carrier: so that I can believe it will actually get upon the trains tomorrow, and be at Scotsbrig in another day or so,&#x2014;there to amuse you a little with <hi rend="italic">un</hi>packing it. In a certain old <hi rend="italic">coffee-pot</hi> there is a slip of writing, apportioning <hi rend="italic">some</hi> items of the rubbish. One Book (Statistical Hist<hi rend="italic">y</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Dumfriesshire</hi>) specially addressed to Jamie.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Inscribed &#x201C;To my dear Brother / James Carlyle (Scotsbrig) / T.C. / Chelsea, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>.&#x201C; TC provides an indexed list of places in Dumfriesshire, and he ends: &#x201C;(a most miserable Book!)&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 7988).</note> Whatever does not specially belong to yourself, and is addressed to nobody,&#x2014;old clothes, books &#x26;c,&#x2014;falls to my Mother, to be disposed of, kept or given, as <hi rend="italic">she</hi> likes. No French N. Testament turned up; I think there was a Spanish one put in! Some of the trashery of books may perhaps suit Jean; but my Mother to settle and decide. <hi rend="italic">De Thou</hi> amounts to <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> heavy folios:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jacques Auguste de Thou, <hi rend="italic">Jac. Augusti Thuani Historiarum Sui Temporis</hi>, 7 vols. (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>).</note> I found a folio Spanish Dict<hi rend="italic">y</hi> of which there were <hi rend="italic">two</hi> quasi-identical copies; I sent on the <hi rend="italic">better</hi> of the two. Planche&#x2019;s Greek Lexicon I propose that you shall exchange with me for the big Hogskin Latin Dict<hi rend="italic">y</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Planch&#xE9;, <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Grec-Fran&#x26;ccedil;ais compos&#xE9; sur le Thesaurus Linguae Graecae de H. Etienne, Nouvelle &#xE9;dition</hi>, by L. A. Vendel-Heyl and A. Pillon (Paris, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>).</note> which is very well worth its houseroom here: if you at any time want such a thing there is one <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> as big (not half so good) hidden upstairs, which <pb id="pg-27-80" n="27:80"/>(or the quarto <hi rend="italic">Calepin</hi>)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A dictionary or polyglot lexicon.</note> shall be greatly at your service. <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi> were included.&#x2014; Here, at this moment, is the little Carrier who has taken everything away; and so we are now quit of it,&#x2014;with my blessing! Poor Graham!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham.</note> I am sorry to hear of his accident; were he not a healthier man than one of a thousand at his age, the breakage of a bone might prove a more serious matter. Give him my regards; and say I hope to hear he is out on the hillside again before long.</p>
<p>We cannot wonder our poor Mother shrinks in from this weather. There was one considerable shower (two or three hours of the night) about a week ago; and for six weeks past not a drop beside: nothing but frost and dust, east north winds, veiled sun, and skies as of harsh potmetal! Uglier weather I never saw, here or elsewhere; and it is very unwholesome too: for example, I went out and had a galloping ride on Thursday last; instead of getting <hi rend="italic">well</hi> thereby, I have got a dirty rheumatism ever since in my left shoulder (<hi rend="italic">humerus</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi>) on which the east-wind played, and at last this morning have even developed it into a straggling lumbago,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">less</hi> power to <hi rend="italic">its</hi> elbow! Rain and the good weather <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come; that is our comfort.</p>
<p>We are beginning to think rather more seriously of a run over to Germany this summer;&#x2014;perhaps even to pack up our things in the <hi rend="italic">Pantechnicon</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A carriage and furniture repository, Belgrave Sq.</note> and get out of this old dusty house altogether. It is clearly impossible to get at the bottom of <hi rend="italic">Frederic&#x2019;s History</hi> in this country, or by importations into this Country,&#x2014;poor Watts<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Watts.</note> is perfectly in despair at my requirements and his own inabilities:&#x2014;and at any rate a plunge into some thoroughly foreign element might be of good service. We shall see.&#x2014; No word yet from Canada; but I say nothing of it (nor need you); indeed I suppose your theory very possible, and at all events we can <hi rend="italic">do</hi> nothing whatever in it.</p>
<p>I saw John Chorley<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Rutter Chorley.</note> last night; solitary he, and vivaciously grim as ever: most obliging as heretofore. Anthony Sterling has finished his Zinc House, and holds <hi rend="italic">tabagies</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Tobacco-parliaments,&#x201C; cf. <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:72&#x2013;73.</note> (or smoking parties in it, Spedding, Ford,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Ford (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9863"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), critic and author of books on Spain.</note> Thackeray &#x26;c) in it, to none of which do I go. His Wife is in the Asylum again, worse than ever.&#x2014; Our Anne continues prostrate with influenza&#x2014;won&#x2019;t go into the hospital; stays with a big daughter of hers;&#x2014;our house is under the care of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> helps, one a good little girl (day and night), the other an excellent cooking-woman (two hours daily); and Jane has much bother keeping all right.&#x2014; <closer><salute>My blessings to my dear old Mother; love to all. Ever yours</salute></closer>   <name>T. C.</name></p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Here is that second leaf of your beneficent Letter, which, as I explained, does not justly belong to me: the first I mean to preserve among my most valued Papers,&#x2014;with many reflexions, now and henceforth, which cannot be conveniently uttered at present. Such an occurrence, unique in my experience of this world, naturally excites reflexions of various kinds!&#x2014;Suffice it to say that your nobleness does not, and shall not if I can help it, meet with any vulgar or ignoble return; and that it shall yet, if there occur any real opportunity, be turned to good for both of us.</p>
<p>For example, if you wanted any Prints, Historical Books &#x26;c &#x26;c when we are in Germany together? I find in the Grange Library some <foreign><hi rend="italic">lacunae</hi></foreign> which might be filled up; if with advantage to me also, of course you would be all the better pleased. Or independently of Germany,&#x2014;if you permitted me to constitute myself your <hi rend="italic">Almoner</hi> to the extent of that Drummond Document,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a check drawn on Drummond&#x2019;s bank.</note> could not I, in such a world as our present one, soon find you good investments for such a sum? Alas, if you did want to treat this <hi rend="italic">burnt offering</hi> as a sacred thing, and not consume it as a common joint of mutton, that would not be very difficult! My Lady has just now (in a wretched Newspaper called <hi rend="italic">The People</hi>) a wild Lecture by a certain &#x201C;W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Maccall,&#x201C; whose character is well known to me, and has better sides than are shewn in that piece;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An advert. in the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> for <date when="1852-01-00">Jan.</date> announced that the <hi rend="italic">Freeman</hi> combined with the <hi rend="italic">People</hi> was to be ed. by Maccall. An ill-natured notice about the <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi> appeared in the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, but George Eliot thought Maccall &#x201C;is too good a man to write otherwise than sincerely&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">George Eliot Letters</hi>, ed. G. S. Haight [<date when="1954-00-00">1954</date>] 2:13&#x2013;14, <date when="1852-03-06">6 March</date>).</note>&#x2014;a poor Presbyterian Anti-presbyterian Child of the Northwind; <pb id="pg-27-82" n="27:82"/>nursed amid bare granites, glaciers, icebergs and spiritual and economical Nova Zemblas; yet in whom there is recognisable a true flash of human valour and fire from Heaven: if I were a god, I sometimes think I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give a little help to this Maccall, the thriftiest proudest and most necessitous of mortals, in his fierce battle with the Frost-Giants, to see if peradventure he c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> work his way thro&#x2019; them to a summer region, where fruit might grow of his planting. Or failing Maccall, whom perhaps his heterodox radicalism (sharp, bright, lean and savage as a razor) render too shocking to you, there want not others (if one knew them) to whom, and to the world thro&#x2019; them, a little money might be true beneficence. If you allow me, I will bear this interest in mind, and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> try to testify my thanks in a legitimate manner.&#x2014; And so, at any rate, let us thank God for all blessings; among which the disposition, with or even without the power, to help one another, is surely among the chief.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is not clear what this is about. Had Lord Ashburton made TC a gift of money, as he did when he bequeathed him &#xa3;2,000 on his death in <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>, which TC gave away in small sums &#x201C;to deserving persons&#x201C;? On making these gifts, he is reported to have said, &#x201C;Here is something from a fund I am trustee for&#x201C;; see D. A. Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 5:541. TC appears to be rejecting a grant, which he does not need, and proposing that it be used for other good purposes.</note></p>
<p>I hope the German speculation still stands; and that the American has not seduced you! That, however, is my own prayer merely, from my particular side of the house; and fundamentally I wish you really to choose the <hi rend="italic">wisest</hi> way. For my own share, I look more and more across to Prussia and the <hi rend="italic">Riesengebirge</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mountain range, SE Prussia, between Silesia and Czechoslovakia.</note> perhaps for a good many months. This place gets too dusty for me, too smoky: I should be better to get into the wind again!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Of course I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very proud to know Lord Hardinge, and even to speak with him a little about soldier matters if there were convenience;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lt.-gen. Sir Henry Hardinge (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12271"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), commander in chief, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>, veteran of Napoleonic and Indian campaigns.</note> but I fear you must not recommend me as the intended of the Great Fritz, or as in any other way meriting such an honour.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Better a <hi rend="italic">half</hi> word than none at all; so I take the pen, snatching still a minute or two before going out to my walk.</p>
<p>On Monday, as intimated to John, a Box of Books and Rubbish went away; perhaps I may still hear today that it has arrived. I remembered, as is usual, <hi rend="italic">too</hi> late, how easily I might have put for you a quarter or two of York-River tobacco into some corner of the packages: but, alas, it was <hi rend="italic">then</hi> impossible enough; and I had to take my vain regrets along with me! For yourself I think there is next to nothing in the big hulk of a load, except the charge of giving things away to others, if they do not (as, I fear, few will) promise to be of any use to you&#x2014; Some bits of Books,&#x2014;especially one John Howe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> (Howe was one of Cromwell&#x2019;s Chaplains),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Howe (<date when="1630-00-00">1630</date>&#x2013;<date when="1705-00-00">1705</date>), Cromwell&#x2019;s domestic chaplain. The sermons may be part of a set of Howe&#x2019;s works, 3 vols. (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), sent to TC by John Childs; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490326-TC-JCHI-01"><sic>23:257</sic><corr>TC to JCHI, <date when="1849-03-26">26 March 1849</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490627-TC-JAC-01"><sic>24:84</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1849-06-27">27 June 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;will perhaps be worth keeping. Forgive me that I did no better. I was hurried, and battered about, at a sad rate that day,&#x2014;and had <hi rend="italic">lumbago</hi> (rheumatism) over and above.</p>
<p>Our weather is still cold and dirty with dust and <foreign>reek</foreign>; but the cold is going at last;&#x2014;and surely we shall by and by have rain, to <hi rend="italic">wash</hi> the air a little. My rheumatics, which were never of more than insignificant extent, are now quite gone; and today I am as well as usual;&#x2014;intending soon to have a vigorous walk. Tonight there is a small Teaparty coming; a certain Lady Stanley (an old friend, from Cheshire) wishing to meet Thomas Erskine;&#x2014;heigho, there will little come of that, I apprehend! But Thomas is always good, and pleasant to see; the Lady also, still considerably beautiful, is always full of vivacity and good humour. Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Chambers called on us yesterday; a fat, cheerfully obstinate looking, prosperous, and not at all unpleasant man. One night we were at a big <foreign>soir&#xE9;e</foreign> at Milnes&#x2019;s (ask John) and his new Wife&#x2019;s:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >16 Upper Brook St., where they gave their first dinner party, <date when="1852-04-03">3 April</date>.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter announcing the arrival of the Box had not come when I wrote and <hi rend="italic">sealed</hi>, this day week; but it came duly before my Note <hi rend="italic">was posted</hi>, and I wrote on the back &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Brief gekom̅en</hi> [Letter received],&#x201C; which however you had not noticed. All was right on that side. Since then there has little or nothing happened; all going on in its usual rather dusty <hi rend="italic">east-windish</hi> way, except perhaps that I have been a little busier than usual, and am taking more and more to my German historical studies. I have got a goodish stock of <hi rend="italic">Maps</hi>, and a bran-new <hi rend="italic">machine</hi> to hold them moreover; I find it add a singular solidity to all one otherwise learns to have the <hi rend="italic">place where</hi> accurately pictured in one&#x2019;s mind. Neuberg&#x2019;s Books have arrived, too; a very small stock, and with an <hi rend="italic">enormously</hi> high carriage to pay from Bonn (the <hi rend="italic">price</hi> of the Books to me there was 17 /by N.&#x2019;s account; the &#x201C;Carriage and Duty&#x201C; is 18 / !) but they are good, some of them, especially an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> old <hi rend="italic">B&#xfc;sching&#x2019;s Erdbeschreibung</hi> (in 9 voll. for 4/6!), and I shall get the value out of them richly after all.&#x2014; &#x2014; One <hi rend="italic">Mont&#xE9;gut</hi>, who reviewed me, with singular <hi rend="italic">piety</hi> and intelligence in the <hi rend="italic">R&#xE9;vue des Deux Mondes</hi> has sent me a small Letter (hardly worth enclosing): he and his Editor have been bothering me this long while, under various modes, for some <hi rend="italic">autobiographic materials</hi>, portrait &#x26;c, which I absolutely refused to have any concern with furnishing; at<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Here ends MS: NLS 514.63.</note> last, two months ago, I wrote, for this Mont&#xE9;gut, Browning&#x2019;s Address upon a card of mine; but even that does not seem to have finished off the man and his importunities. <pb id="pg-27-85" n="27:85"/>This morning there has come a letter from Reumont (the Naples Masaniello man), who seems to be now Prussian Resident at Florence, Jane has still got that on hand;&#x2014;and indeed it is not worth sending if she were done with it.

<p>Poor Jane is still bothered much with her servant depart<hi rend="italic">t;</hi> that is to say, Anne is still unwell, now &#x201C;in the country&#x201C; for a week past: the little girl is very active and faithful, and our Cook-woman is quite excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in her line; but of course both of them need superintending, and in this bad weather Jane is not strong. The day before yesterday she had again, after many months, one of her bad headaches and is still rather frailish in consequence, tho&#x2019; as good as thro&#x2019; it now for two days.&#x2014; We have still the bitterest barrenest weather, not a drop of rain; and tho&#x2019; occasionally there is strong sun, the fields <hi rend="italic">here</hi> offer a strange contrast to what you describe of Scotland,&#x2014;hardly a hue of green to be noticed on them.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Your Books &#x26;c have at length arrived; four days ago; all safe; and were extremely welcome to me. I have already fallen upon some of them, and shall before long be thro&#x2019; the whole lot, in one form of perusal or another. <hi rend="italic">Frederic&#x2019;s Grandmother</hi> has proved well worth the time spent on it; <hi rend="italic">B&#xfc;sching</hi>, too, I am delighted with,&#x2014;certainly of all Books I ever saw, the cheapest! And the old <hi rend="italic">K&#xF6;nigreich B&#xF6;heim</hi>, all ashy with the fires of the 30-years war, and full of ancient aspects of the habitable Earth in R&#xfc;bezahl&#x2019;s country: you cannot think what good I shall get of it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote, <date when="1852-03-20">20 March</date>, that he was sending <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires pour servir &#xE0; l&#x2019;histoire de Sophie Charlotte, reine de Prusse, par [Jean Pierre] Erman</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>), cost 6d., as he &#x201C;thought that a little acquaintance with the accomplished Grandmother of Frederick&#x2014;and Great-granddaughter of your Scotch James&#x2014;might be worth <hi rend="italic">six</hi> pence to see.&#x201C; Further, &#x201C;as you seem such an admirer of <hi rend="italic">B&#xfc;sching</hi> I am glad to have succeeded in procuring another Copy at the same price as mine was &#x2026; 4 / 6.&#x201C; &#x201C;If the <hi rend="italic">Topographie Bohemiae</hi> &#x26;c. should turn out more curious than useful, I shall be glad to take it off your hands again, as I have bought some other volumes of the same work (at a sale).&#x201C; Neuberg listed this as &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Zeillers</hi> Topographia Bohemiae, Moraviae et Silesiae; das ist Beschreibung der vornehmsten Strasse und Pl&#xE4;tze &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;(with many Plates) Frankfurt a / M. <hi rend="italic">Morian.</hi> <date when="1650-00-00">1650</date>&#x2013;<date when="1656-00-00">6</date> / 6.&#x201C;</note> I have already learned <hi rend="italic">beyond dispute</hi>, what I never could before, which of the Friedland&#x2019;s was Wallenstein&#x2019;s, where he indubitably did superintend such stone-and-mortar work in those wild years,&#x2014;Stralsund and some other things (tho&#x2019; not quite &#x201C;hung on a chain from Heaven&#x201C;) having proved impregnable to him.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Albrecht von Wallenstein put down the Bohemian revolt against the emperor and was allowed to purchase confiscated estates, notably Friedland, which he was permitted to develop into a principality, <date when="1624-00-00">1624</date>, of which he was made duke. He besieged Stralsund, a small Baltic port, in an attempt to drive the Danish invader out of Germany during the Thirty Years War, but after a month, <date when="1628-07-00">July 1628</date>, he was forced to withdraw. See <hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 12:278.</note> Thanks also for the <hi rend="italic">Bellum Septennis</hi>, which is well done, and will have its uses.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote, <date when="1852-03-20">20 March</date>: &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">Historia Belli Septennis</hi> is a Latin translation of Archenholz&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Siebenj&#xE4;hrigen Krieg.</hi>&#x201C;</note> The original was the first book I ever read in German; I went thro&#x2019; it again lately, still with satisfaction and instruction: the Translation (which I had heard of but never seen) will serve me for reference since I have not the original, of my own.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Historia Belli Septennis in Germania</hi>, trans. H. G. Reichard (Bayreuth, <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>).</note> The other little Book of <hi rend="italic">Instructions</hi>, which was once an invaluable unattainable curiosity to mankind, is still richly worth several sixpences to one inquiring man!&#x2014; Stieler&#x2019;s maps I find to be capital (especially with a huge <hi rend="italic">eyeglass</hi> which I have got, big as a fireshovel): of them and of Reymann&#x2019;s (of which <pb id="pg-27-87" n="27:87"/>later let me recommend you a shilling&#x2019;s worth, whenever you go a day&#x2019;s journey in Germany) I mean to have plenty from Henrietta Street<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Covent Garden, Williams &#x26; Norgate&#x2019;s address.</note> whenever I need them. They are to be had here at the same price as with you. Thanks, many thanks, for all the pains you have taken with me.</p>
<p>If at any time you meet with these two Books: Mauvillon: <hi rend="italic">Vie de Fred</hi>c <hi rend="italic">Guill</hi>me <hi rend="italic">I;</hi>&#x2014;and Mauvillon (<hi rend="italic">son</hi> of the former): <hi rend="italic">Vie de Ferdinand Duc de Brunswic</hi> (unless the German <hi rend="italic">original</hi> is considered to be better for some reason?)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#xc9;l&#xE9;azer de Mauvillon, <hi rend="italic">Histoire de Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Guillaume I, Roi de Prusse et &#xc6;lecteur de Brandebourg</hi>, 2 vols.

I <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> for the two sets of <hi rend="italic">Anekdoten</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you found recommended; the London Library buys these (thanks to it): if Nicolai&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Anekdoten</hi> was not one of the two sets&#x2014; But I think it was. Any way I must hear Nicolai, heavy surly authentic man, to the very last word.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Carriage and duty</hi>&#x201C; of these Books, as charged by W<hi rend="italic">ms</hi> &#x26; Norgate, was enormous! That is one fact to be kept in mind: 18/ for that inconsiderable parcel; I mean to go and remonstrate, but fancy I shall make nothing of it. Only, if so, we will try to avoid Herr Hartmann on future occasions.</p>
<p>Had I known in time, George Bunsen w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have saved us all the trouble together: he came from Bonn hither about a fortnight ago; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">would have carried</hi>&#x201C; &#x26;c, nay still &#x201C;would,&#x201C;&#x2014;and, just two days before your parcel came, insisted on sending a plan of route in such cases,&#x2014;which, if it can ever be of use either to me or to you (for I could receive here any light object, and send it whither you bade), I will excerpt for you. It is this:</p>
<p>The Prussian Courier comes by Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle&#x2014;I know not <pb id="pg-27-88" n="27:88"/>whether on horseback or on wheels, but confidently suppose the latter. A Herr von zur Hosen (Lord of In-the-Breeches!), Royal Postmaster there, receives and communicates with him. Therefore, in regard to any not too bulky or heavy thing (<hi rend="italic">limits</hi> were not indicated to me, and did not seem to be strict), here is how you do:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">First:</hi> Direct the Parcel (all its <hi rend="italic">inward</hi> covers and directions being well completed), &#x201C;S<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Excellenz Dem Herrn Ritter Bunsen (I suppose that is exact?) &#x26;c &#x26;c London marking it, &#x201C;<foreign>zur Er&#xF6;ffnung des</foreign> [to be opened by] D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Georg Bunsen&#x201C;.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Secondly:</hi> Put another cover, and addressing it,</p>
<q>&#x201C;K. Ober Postdirector Herrn von zur Hosen</q>
<q>(<foreign>Inhalt: Drucksachen</foreign> [Contents: Printed Matter])</q>
<p>N&#x2014;&#x2014;g (whatever that is)<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The words in parenthesis are circled in MS.</note> Aachen, send it by Fahrpost to Aachen,&#x2014;when we hear there is Courier expected soon. Of this latter essential fact I could at any time (I suppose), on inquiry, give you notice.&#x2014; And so enough of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Drucksachen</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Speditions handel</hi></foreign> [forwarding business] for the present.</p>
<p>This George Bunsen wishes to make your acquaintance when he returns to Bonn, which I think will be before long. He is an intelligent-talking, very goodnatured, courteous and amiable young man; extremely expert and far advanced in his academic accomplishments I believe&#x2014;tho&#x2019; his eyes (threatening often total blindness) have been a sad bar to him:&#x2014;indeed I believe he must really have a great deal of talent in some form or mode; tho&#x2019; for myself I have not yet made much of him; and can only testify expressly to his excellence in <hi rend="italic">singing</hi>, and to his perfect placidity and kindness of temper: his speech, which is very copious, does wear an aspect of wise extensive understanding, and even of depth, and superiority of view,&#x2014;but lacks <hi rend="italic">bone</hi> dreadfully when you come to handle it; begins <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> nowhere, ends d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, and in fact melts very much into more cloud on various sides! However I think there is no question but he will make a pleasant speaking neighbour to you; so he shall have his card freely when he goes.</p>
<p>We are plodding along here in the old dusty way; terribly off for <hi rend="italic">weather;</hi> indeed I call it the dustiest, bleakest, ugliest spring I can remember even in London,&#x2014;and extremely backward, owing to the drought, which is only this day promising to end; tho&#x2019; my Brother writes from Scotland it is quite the reverse in those naturally damp regions, altogether an &#x201C;Italian spring,&#x201C; and the best they ever saw. Here everybody is down with influenza, our poor Housemaid banished into the country, glad she is still alive; that happily is the worst in our premises; my Wife has escaped hitherto, and tho&#x2019; weak is generally able to stir about, and front the additional domestic tribulations,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">un</hi>happily today she too is imprisoned with headache, and far enough from well.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-89" n="27:89"/>We have M. Thiers here and quantities of talking and galloping people; of whom however I get less and less good as I grow older: Heaven knows it never, at the youngest, was very much! Thiers, in particular, is a noticeable subject: <foreign><hi rend="italic">bon gar&#x26;ccedil;on</hi></foreign> truly, with the light eupeptic practical Gascon spirit very strong in him; has a most musical, plaintively-singing and yet essentially gay and jaunty <hi rend="italic">treble</hi> voice; talks unweariedly, and in a very neat and clear and carelessly frank and ingenious way, with the same; close-cropt bullet-head, of fair weight, almost quite white; laughing little hazel eyes, jolly hook-nose and most definite mouth; short, short (five feet three or two, at most), swells slightly in the middle,&#x2014;soft, <hi rend="italic">sausage-like</hi>, on the whole,&#x2014;and ends neatly in fat little feet and hands: such is Thiers to the outward eye and ear; a man, for the rest, worth listening to, a little; a little and not much; for after all his notions of everything are hopelessly commonplace, his talent a <hi rend="italic">beaver</hi> one out and out: of things higher (and this is even a saving clause for the man and his history) he has never had a tone of intimation; can go along <hi rend="italic">without</hi> a conscience good or bad, and has found that answer, in the element he lived in. Nothing of the hypocrite in poor Thiers; a cheerful healthy human parliamentary beaver; <foreign><hi rend="italic">bon gar&#x26;ccedil;on</hi></foreign> to this day. Guizot I generally consider to have had a conscience, nay still to aim at having one; and to be first &#x26; chiefly damnable from that addition to his outfit; a <hi rend="italic">hypocrite</hi>-fanatic; full of rancour, gloom and deceit and self-deceit:&#x2014; Unhappy constitutional human creatures that we are! To think what Guesclin or Turenne or Sully or Colbert<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bertrand Du Guesclin (<date when="1320-00-00">1320</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1380-00-00">80</date>); Henri de la Tour d&#x2019;Auvergne (<date when="1611-00-00">1611</date>&#x2013;<date when="1675-00-00">75</date>), count de Turenne; Maximilien de Bethune (<date when="1559-00-00">1559</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1641-00-00">1641</date>), baron de Rosny and duke de Sully; Jean Baptiste Colbert (<date when="1619-00-00">1619</date>&#x2013;<date when="1683-00-00">83</date>).</note> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say to <hi rend="italic">these</hi> improved Kings of France, is the source of unspeakable infinitudes of reflexions to me.&#x2014;</p>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">Nephew</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I am glad to hear, by your letter, that you are intent upon self-improvement; to increase one&#x2019;s knowledge of profitable things, and in all ways cultivate one&#x2019;s immortal soul, is surely the duty of every creature according to his opportunities. &#x2026;</p>
<p>Since you are at the trade of Teaching, your first care ought to be to perfect yourself more and more in all the branches you are required to teach. Nothing is more frightful than a Schoolmaster who is himself ignorant, or ill-informed, upon the things he is trying to impart to his scholars. Beyond and before all other pursuits, you must make yourself master of whatever you are teaching, or likely to be called at any time to teach. To begin with the beginning: Your handwriting, for example, though promising and tolerable, is by no means good <hi rend="italic">enough;</hi> the way to improve it, and there is no other way, is to <hi rend="italic">practise daily;</hi> write every day, <hi rend="italic">trying</hi> to do better &#x2026; and in short get a good hand,&#x2014;swift, distinct, simple, and without waste of room. Then there are Arithmetic, Geography, English Grammar &#x2026; . Many schoolmasters I have <pb id="pg-27-91" n="27:91"/>seen who were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> intelligent of Arithmetic and its principles; they taught it, as they worked it, by rote, and had no knowledge of principles. Do you not imitate these; if you are still in that situation, get yourself a good book of Arithmetic. &#x2026; labouring incessantly with your whole strength (which is the real secret of success in all attempts in whatever direction) &#x2026; .</p>
<p>In the rear of Arithmetic, and essential for a Schoolmaster who will rise above the lowest sphere of his business, are Mensuration, Geometry, Algebra, and the whole field of Mathematics; a very noble subject, useful in all manner of ways;&#x2014;and a subject withal in which a man of real sense can make his own way, to any length, without help of a teacher. Indeed there are few or no subjects on which a man of real sense,&#x2014;real industry, honesty, and steadfast perseverance,&#x2014;cannot make his own way; and if you do make it, it is better in many respects, and far more productive for you, than if a teacher had helped.</p>
<p>For English Grammar &#x2026; <supplied>[there is]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">Cobbett&#x2019;s</hi> little book &#x2026; one of the clearest and best<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210324-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:347</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-03-24">24 March 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note>. &#x2026; Cobbett is otherwise a great example to you: he began life here in London as a wandering lad, barely able to read, who was obliged to <hi rend="italic">enlist;</hi> as a private soldier he took to study, while others were idling and drinking; and he ended as a man of solid cultivation, and of high mark in the world. &#x2026; <supplied>[As for geography]</supplied> Almost any Book you can pick up on that subject, will open a wide field of enquiry and improvement for you: I recommend that, and all the astronomy you can acquire, as very useful.&#x2014; Beyond and in advance of all these subjects, lie Foreign Languages, especially French and Latin. &#x2026; Cobbett learned French with hardly any master (except perhaps a chance hint about the pronunciation). &#x2026;</p>
<p>With regard to reading for general improvement &#x2026; read whatever good Books you can find. &#x2026; Read no <hi rend="italic">fool&#x2019;s</hi> Book if you can help it; fly from a fool as you would from poison, in your reading and in all other pursuits of yours! &#x2026; It is less important to a man that he read many Books, than that he read a few <hi rend="italic">well</hi> and with his whole mind awake to them. This is indisputably certain. A very small lot of Books will serve to nourish a man&#x2019;s mind, if he handle them well&#x2014;and I have known innumerable people whose minds had gone all to ruin, by reading carelessly too many Books. It is like omnivorous <hi rend="italic">feeding.</hi> &#x2026; The wisest men I have known in this world were by no means great <hi rend="italic">readers; good</hi> readers I should rather say, of a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> Books that were wise,&#x2014;and having an <hi rend="italic">abhorrence</hi> of all Books they found to be <hi rend="italic">foolish.</hi> A man gathers wisdom only from his own sincere exertions and reflexions; and in this it is not really very much that other men can do for him; but whatever help there is, he will find with the <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> alone. &#x2026; Read <hi rend="italic">well</hi> whatever books you can get that you <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> to be good ones; try them well with your own <pb id="pg-27-92" n="27:92"/>judgment, earnestly, but yet humbly and loyally; you will get <hi rend="italic">more</hi> light at every step, and see better what country, what path is <hi rend="italic">ahead</hi> of you if you do this as you ought.</p>
<p>As to subjects for reading, <supplied>[he praised history and named books, adding that]</supplied> Chronology and Geography are the <hi rend="italic">lamps</hi> of History. &#x2026;</p>
<p><closer><salute>Give my kind wishes, remembrances and regards to your Father and Mother: we have drifted far asunder since that night I stayed in their hospitable house at Cockermouth; may all good be with them always, and with you.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I am much afraid I missed your Newspapers yesterday, and you will not get them till tomorrow along with this. I am very sorry; but the case was thus. I sat scribbling here longer than my custom, but did not at all know it was so late, and so put my pocketful of Letters and Newspapers into the first <hi rend="italic">Chelsea</hi> Postoffice: on getting up to the Eaton-Square clock, I found it past <hi rend="italic">five</hi>, an hour beyond what I expected, and at first could hardly believe my eyes!&#x2014; You must forgive me this time, and I will try to be more pointed again.</p>
<p>Enclosed is the Cover of a Canada Newspaper which came from Alick yesterday afternoon. It has the due &#x201C;three strokes&#x201C; on it, and was very welcome indeed,&#x2014;as, if the Doctor have told you about the missive I had sent to Alick long since, you will very well understand.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520218-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1852-02-18">18 Feb.</date></ref></note> It is all right now, and no mistake has happened;&#x2014;and, another time, we ought to be more patient, and think how <hi rend="italic">long</hi> it sometimes takes to get an answer back by the speediest method, in spite of all the Steamers they have.</p>
<p>We are still very cold, tho&#x2019; with bright sun today; and have still no rain. But poor Jane&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Anne</hi>, the Servant is at last coming home today, or come, and greatly mended, in fact quite able for her business; which will be a special convenience.&#x2014; Tell Jack this is <hi rend="italic">Paper</hi> (of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> kind I am now using) which can be had if he likes it, whenever there is a <hi rend="italic">conveyance</hi> for it, and an order given.</p>
<p>Dear Mother I am much hurried and flurried, my work all still ahead of me; and so must <hi rend="italic">end.</hi> I delight to think of you looking at the primroses again <pb id="pg-27-93" n="27:93"/>under the blessed spring sun: thanks to Heaven for all its mercies to us!

<salute>Dear Lord Lyttelton,</salute>
<p>I am much shocked at your news of poor Cochrane&#x2019;s case, of which I had heard nothing. Poor old man, I should be heartily grieved to lose him; and to his Office too, with all his faults, it may be a loss. True, he by no means shone as a distributor of books,&#x2014;and could never bring himself to believe that the wish of everybody without restraint to anybody <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> by any skill be complied with;&#x2014;but he was full of good nature, did much really useful work in a quiet lucid way, in spite of his indolence; and for practical help as a <hi rend="italic">Bibliographer</hi>, he was far the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> I ever met with in this country; and I believe we need not hope to find his match in that respect.</p>
<p>My name, I understand, is still on the Committee; but I have taken almost no share in any kind of Library business since those old days when you used to attend. Of course, if we lose poor Cochrane, it will behove us to use all possible care to get a fit successor. If I have anything to do with it (which seems doubtful), I can only engage to endeavour with all my industry to get the <hi rend="italic">fittest</hi> attainable. Mr Gladstone&#x2019;s friend appears to be an interesting man;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Philip (b. Giacomo Filippo) Lacaita, as a legal adviser to the British legation in Naples, had helped Gladstone gather information about Bourbon misrule; but, forced into exile, he had come to London.</note> and his qualifications if he present evidence of them, will deserve to be well investigated, and candidly and even charitably estimated: but I should fear, on the first glance of the business, his being a Foreigner would prove a very heavy drawback,&#x2014;heavy in appearance, and almost as heavy in reality, for the Keeper of an English Popular library. Panizzi, as I have been obliged to estimate him in painfully traversing his dim crypts and labyrinths, is by no means an instance of the <hi rend="italic">preferability</hi> of Foreigners to natives even for such a post as his! As Librarian to a Prince, King, or Private Nobleman, Foreigner or Native, <foreign><hi rend="italic">caeteris paribus</hi></foreign> [other things being equal], might be nearly indifferent; but, I imagine, only there.</p>
<p>I suppose you are out of Office at present, or at least one hopes you are?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had been under-sec. of state for the colonies in Lord John Russell&#x2019;s ministry.</note> <pb id="pg-27-94" n="27:94"/>In that case, who knows but you pass Chelsea sometimes, in your rides or otherwise? If you ever called here, I should be right happy to have a little speech with you again. Some day or other a miracle of that kind may happen;&#x2014;between 2&#xBD; p.m. and 3, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a very slight violation of the natural law!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>There will be no difficulty about sending you the paper, so soon as we ascertain beyond dispute what kind it is you want. By your last Note I seem to perceive that your favourite is <hi rend="italic">this</hi> sort, this that I am now writing on? Only that there are to be <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of these leaves in a sheet, instead of only one as here? Now this is not <hi rend="italic">Chorley&#x2019;s</hi> paper; this is <hi rend="italic">Darwin&#x2019;s</hi> kind; and is sold spontaneously (it, or something like it, for this is not precisely the same as my former stock) at a shop in Oxford Street. Of course they can easily cut it into common note <hi rend="italic">sheets;</hi> the form of <hi rend="italic">leaves</hi> (as here) is only got by negociation, and not always quite successfully. If you want this kind, say &#x201C;Darwin&#x2019;s,&#x201C; half a ream, or whatever quantity; and in a few days it can be forwarded to Jones at the L<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Library (whom I will warn about it),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Edward Jones, asst. librarian.</note> and sent up to you (on <hi rend="italic">his</hi> giving <hi rend="italic">you</hi> warning as I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> direct him to do), along with what Books he may find procurable. It is not bad paper; and, if I remember, rather cheap: I some times find it too <hi rend="italic">slippery</hi>, but with certain kinds of pens it still does best, or as well as any.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <hi rend="italic">Chorley&#x2019;s</hi> paper, of which I likewise inclose a specimen, is to be got, in quantities, only by industry and treaty; but I think Chorley understands the man to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> at this time a ream or half a ream of it on hand:&#x2014;so that if you wish <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, you have only to say &#x201C;Chorley&#x2019;s,&#x201C; and state the quantity &#x26;c, which will arrive with equal promptitude. It is <hi rend="italic">genuine</hi> rag-paper of the old kind, the only specimen I have seen for nearly 20 years; but occasionally I find it a tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> too rough; and on the whole, tho&#x2019; analogous, it is not wholly equal to the last specimen I had of the article in Dumfries before shifting to these parts.&#x2014; This is the needful concerning paper.</p>
<p>Poor old Cochrane, of whom I had heard nothing till the night before your Letter came, appears to have been lying in a dark &#x201C;low fever&#x201C; for above a fortnight,&#x2014;I suppose probably an aggravated <hi rend="italic">influenza</hi>, owing to the hard <pb id="pg-27-95" n="27:95"/>weather;&#x2014;and the Doctor (Sir J. Clarke)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Clark (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5463"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), eminent physician.</note> has very bad hopes of him. The poor old man lies deep-sunk, seldom &#x201C;rightly conscious&#x201C; (Jones thinks), and awaits, in the heart of such dark whirlpools and abstruse confusions, the issue, of life or death. <hi rend="italic">Two</hi> applications for his Office came to me the day before your Letter. Jones had the propriety to give no hint or whisper of any hopes or wishes he might have. He has some merits, poor Jones, and might probably be had cheap; but I fear his ignorance of Bibliography, and indeed of general things, would go hard against him, if a man of any real qualification were to present himself. If a vacancy do occur at present (which I still struggle to consider doubtful), I believe the Committee, at least the <hi rend="italic">standing</hi> members and managers, will be quite awake to the considerable worth and perfect good conduct of Jones.</p>
<p>I fancied I had already <hi rend="italic">given</hi> Tho<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Bell charge of the woods on those terms you mention: at any rate, I now give it thro&#x2019; you, and desire you so to settle the matter with him.</p>
<p>I am always tremulously thankful to hear of my dear old Mother&#x2019;s holding out against this ugly weather. Oh, take care of her; and keep her near the warm corner, except when the sun is shining! People are becoming really grave here on the subject of this iron drought and cold. Not a drop of rain yet; a few days ago the sky, and dark blustering of the cloudy eastwind, promised rain; but that is all gone again, and the bad element of dust and frost and glaring sun rules supreme. Such a time of dust I never saw! In spite of all watering, by innumerable <hi rend="italic">pauper</hi> trucks and Paddington Carts<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carts used in the parish of Paddington, but the precise kind or allusion not accounted for.</note> everywhere, the whole world seems filled with fine dust; thro&#x2019; every keyhole and crevice it finds access,&#x2014;lodges in the most concealed drawer; the Queen herself (unless she sit to the chin in spring water) is not able to keep her royal skin clean,&#x2014;a clean shift upon her royal back it is impossible except for moments to have!&#x2014; And water is getting scarce in the country parts hereabouts, and grass there is yet as good as none; the sheep, I hear, are perishing in the Hampshire and Wiltshire regions for sheer hunger:&#x2014;in short, rain is immensely wanted by everybody; and will come, doubtless, at its own time. Often, and seldom more than now, have I admired the prevailing phrase &#x201C;fine weather,&#x201C; as commonly used by mankind to express &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">dry</hi> weather&#x201C; merely! No degree of wet that I ever knew is half so unendurable to Soul and sense as some of the excesses of drought which are frequent even here from year to year.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother: it is highly expedient I should get to some form of work while the day is inexorably travelling on! Give my love to Jamie and <pb id="pg-27-96" n="27:96"/>Isabella, and all the rest. Bid my Mother not read quite so much; but speak a little with some of you about what she reads! It is interesting and wonderful to see what a glorious faculty she still has for taking in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> kind of interesting human discourse of reason. It is the reward of having a simple and clear heart, and being a real and loyal <hi rend="italic">citizen</hi> of this Universe.&#x2014; Yours ever affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi>,</salute></closer></p>

    <p>I did not see the <hi rend="italic">Notes & Queries</hi> till this minute when you have sent them.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lenthall sent TC a copy of <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries</hi>, vol. 5, <date when="1852-04-24">24 April</date>, which had queries from Lenthall about William Lenthall (<date when="1591-00-00">1591</date>&ndash;<date when="1662-00-00">1662</date>), speaker of the House of Commons in the Long Parliament, <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date>, and in the restored Long Parliament, <date when="1659-00-00">1659</date> (393).</note> I possess no knowledge on the subject except what is above indicated.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC&rsquo;s letter is written below his answers given on a sheet attached parallel to the printed queries. Lenthall asked first: &ldquo;In a biographical notice (MS.) of Speaker Lenthall by the Rev. Mark Noble, I find the following passage: / &lsquo;His (Lenthall&rsquo;s) ancestor is mentioned in the will of Sir Richard Williams <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Cromwell &hellip; the great-grandfather of Oliver Lord Protector. There was always a friendship between the family of Cromwell and that of Lenthall.&rsquo; / Can any one versed in Cromwellian lore kindly inform me if any such will is in existence; and &hellip; its date?&rdquo; Mark Noble (<date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>&ndash;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Protectorate-House of Cromwell</hi>, 2 vols.

</ref>. Replying to Lenthall, TC underlined the word &ldquo;date&rdquo; in the printed query and wrote to the side: &ldquo;Will <hi rend="italic">proved</hi>, &lsquo;<date when="1546-11-28">28 Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1546</date>&rsquo; (Noble&rsquo;s <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> I.18); was <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> by Noble, &lsquo;in the Prerogative Office, Allan 20.&rsquo; (lp. note), where probably it still is.&rdquo; Lenthall asked secondly whether &ldquo;there was <hi rend="italic">always</hi> a friendship between the Cromwells and Lenthalls.&rdquo; TC replied: &ldquo;Probably none whatever.&rdquo; Lenthall&rsquo;s third question was: &ldquo;It is stated by Wood (<hi rend="italic">Athen. Oxon.</hi>, article <hi rend="italic">Lenthall</hi>), and repeated in substance by Noble &hellip; , that &lsquo;two or more&rsquo;&rdquo; of the speeches by the speaker&rsquo;s son, Sir John Lenthall, &ldquo;&lsquo;spoken in the time of usurpation,&rsquo; are in print. &hellip; I should greatly value any clue that may direct me to them. &hellip; On Noble&rsquo;s authority, when unsupported, &hellip; little reliance can be placed; but in any matter of detail &hellip; related by Wood, I have considerable &hellip; faith.&rdquo; TC responded: &ldquo;There is little doubt Wood is <hi rend="italic">correct;</hi> one seldom or never finds him wrong in regard to such points. Probably also the speeches are <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the Museum;&mdash;but to ascertain there, and get at them there, will be a task!

</ref>. Lenthall finally asked: &ldquo;In a brief and singularly inaccurate memoir of Lenthall, in the <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Speakers</hi> [by J. A. Manning], lately published by Churton [<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>], the following passage occurs: / &lsquo;We omitted to state in reference to Mr. Lenthall&rsquo;s strenuous exertions in favour of the gallant Earl of Derby, that Mrs. Cromwell, in one of her letters to the Protector, urges him to endeavour to effect a reconciliation with the Speaker,&rsquo; &c. &c. / As no authority is cited, I should be glad to learn where the letters &hellip; referred to are to be found.&rdquo; TC replied: &ldquo;Nonsense, and baseless balderdash, nearly altogether. There exists one &lsquo;Letter&rsquo; from Mrs Cromwell in which there is <hi rend="italic">mention</hi> of the &lsquo;Speaker&rsquo;: it is to this probably &hellip; that the Author refers.&rdquo; See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:276.</note>&mdash; Noble, tho&rsquo; inaccurate, does not <hi rend="italic">lie</hi> at any time; you may take it for <pb id="pg-27-98" n="27:98" />granted then he <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> the Will, and fancied he read (almost undoubtedly did read) such a clause in it.</p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>Unluckily I shall not be able to attend your meeting on Tuesday Evening;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1852-05-04">4 May</date>, at Chapman&#x2019;s bookshop, 142 Strand. In &#x201C;The Commerce of Literature,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> 57 (<date when="1852-04-00">April 1852</date>): 511&#x2013;54 (pbd. separately later in the month as <hi rend="italic">Cheap Books, and How to Get Them</hi>), Chapman addressed the dangers of price-fixing by the Booksellers&#x2019; Assoc., which prevented books being discounted to the public by more than 10 percent of the pbd. price. A publisher who did this was to be excluded from buying books at trade prices. Chapman had refused to sell imported American works according to this rule, and so was barred from obtaining books at favorable prices from most publishers, on which Richard Bentley and J. W. Parker withdrew from the assoc. Chapman&#x2019;s article and a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> leader supporting Chapman aroused discussion, and it was agreed to submit the matter to arbitration by a group headed by the chief justice, Lord Campbell (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4521"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>). At the arbitrators&#x2019; meeting, <date when="1852-04-14">14 April</date>, the assoc. put its case, but Lord Campbell&#x2019;s committee deferred judgment until they had heard the other side. Booksellers and authors against the assoc. met on <date when="1852-05-04">4 May</date>, with Dickens in the chair, when letters from absent supporters, including TC, were read and resolutions passed. It was decided not to send a delegation to Lord Campbell, <date when="1852-05-14">14 May</date>, but to send resolutions with a covering letter by Dickens (see <hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 6:667, 671). Lord Campbell gave the arbitrators&#x2019; judgment, <date when="1852-05-19">19 May</date>, that the assoc.&#x2019;s regulations were &#x201C;unreasonable and indefensible&#x201C; and &#x201C;contrary to the freedom of commerce&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1852-05-20">20 May</date>). After heated discussion, <date when="1852-05-28">28 May</date>, the assoc. voted to dissolve.</note> but I can have no hesitation in testifying my concurrence with the object of it,&#x2014;which I understand, in brief, to be <hi rend="italic">Free-trade in Books</hi>, or the first step in a course leading straight towards that.</p>
<p>Free-trade, in respect of Books, and indeed of most other objects, is by no means the ultimatum one aspires to, or the perfect condition that will satisfy the world&#x2019;s want in the matter; very far from that in many cases; and in the case of Literature, farther than in any other whatsoever. But surely in all cases, and in that of Literature too, free trade is better than trade unjustly crippled by monopolies which are merely blind and greedy: in present circumstances, <pb id="pg-27-100" n="27:100"/>free trade were a clear improvement; and moreover, in the actual disposition of the world, it is a first stage thro&#x2019; which all faulty things must pass, and only beyond and after trial of which can any progress that will prove true and lasting be looked for.</p>
<p>For the rest, I fear there are few branches of human industry, and most clearly Literature is not one of them, in which the <hi rend="italic">shopkeeper</hi> spirit (so we may call it, for the sake of definition) will suffice to regulate &#x201C;production and distribution&#x201C; according to the world&#x2019;s real want and interest: in regard to very many, there is perpetually needed a generous <hi rend="italic">merchant</hi> spirit (which, it may be feared, free trade and active competition will not much tend to develope among us): and in regard to some, there is needed a spirit higher than any kind of merchandise, and not looking to profit-and-loss for advice at all. Now certainly, beyond all other objects, Literature, in its higher forms, belong to this latter class: to these two latter classes it belongs in all forms of it that have any value to mankind: for the mere shopkeeper spirit, looking only to the visible vicinity, and sharpened into ever greater eagerness for immediate returns, is smitten with eternal incompetence in even the finance of Literature, and can do no good whatever there that would not otherwise be done, and does immensities of mischief there which perhaps might otherwise remain undone.</p>
<p>All this is true even of the finance of Literature:&#x2014;and alas, Literature has many elements besides the financial, and far more important to it than the financial; in regard to all of which it would so gladly cease to be anarchic, and become well-ordered, and well-governed, if it only could! Truly, to consider how Society at present stands related to Literature may well fill the thinking man with astonishment, with anxiety, almost with terror. The duties of Society towards Literature, in these new conditions of the world, are becoming great, vital, inexpressibly intricate,&#x2014;little capable of being done or understood at present, but all-important to be understood and done, if society will continue to exist along with it, and it along with society. From the highest provinces of spiritual culture and the most sacred interests of men, down to the lowest economic and ephemeral concerns where &#x201C;Free Press&#x201C; rules supreme, Society may see itself, with all its sovereignties and parliaments, depending on the thing it calls Literature; and bound, under incalculable penalties, to very many duties in regard to that! Of which duties, I perceive, finance alone, and free-trade alone, will by no means be found to be the sum.&#x2014; But such considerations lie far beyond our present business; and must not be more than alluded to here.</p>
<p>What alone concerns us here is to remark that the present System of Book-publishing discharges none of these duties,&#x2014;less and less makes even the appearance of discharging them;&#x2014;and indeed as I believe is, by the nature of the case, incapable of ever, in any perceptible degree discharging any of them <pb id="pg-27-101" n="27:101"/>in the times that now are. A century ago, there was in the Bookselling Guild,&#x2014;if never any royalty of spirit, as how could such be looked for there?&#x2014;yet a spirit of solid merchanthood, which had its value in regard to the prosaic parts of Literature and is ever to be thankfully remembered there. Of this solid merchant spirit, if we take the victualling and furnishing of such an enterprise as <hi rend="italic">Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s English Dictionary</hi> for its highest feat (as perhaps we justly may), and many a <hi rend="italic">Petitot&#x2019;s M&#xE9;moires, Encyclopedia Britannica</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Johnson, <hi rend="italic">A Dictionary of the English Language</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1755-00-00">1755</date>). <hi rend="italic">Collection compl&#xE8;te des M&#xE9;moires relatifs &#xE0; l&#x2019;histoire de France</hi>, ed. Claude Bernard Petitot, with Alexandre Petitot and L. J. N. Monmerqu&#xE9;, 130 vols. (Paris, <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-00-00">29</date>). <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi>, 3 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>), 10 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1783-00-00">83</date>), 18 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>).</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c in this country and in others, for its lower, we must gratefully admit the real usefulness, respectability, and merit to the world.&#x2014; But in later times, owing to many causes which have been active not on the Book-Guild alone, such spirit has long been diminishing; and has now as good as disappeared, without hope of resuscitation in that quarter. The spirit of the Book-trade, it is mournfully evident, is that of modern trade generally, no better and no worse; a hand-to-mouth spirit, incapable of ever again paying for even a Johnson&#x2019;s Dictionary; not what I can call a merchant spirit, but (on the great or on the small scale) a shopkeeper one. Such is the melancholy fact, so far as my experience and observation have taught me to form an opinion: if my vote is enquired of in the matter, I grieve to say, and am not conscious of either anger or of favour in saying, it is authentically this. Which leads me, and indeed has long since led me, to infer that the Publishing Guild, taking large wages for doing indispensable work, and quite omitting to do it, is in no safe or lasting position before the Public, and will prove incapable of standing unless it can escape being inquired into.</p>
<p>If the Public itself (as I by no means believe or ever believed) is adequate, by free-trade or otherwise, to remunerate Literature, the Public ought to have at least a chance of trying to do it. The present System,&#x2014;by which above one half of the selling-price of a Book (&#x201C;from 55 to 65 per cent, including advertisements&#x201C;) is paid over to a man or set of men, not who write it or print it, or bind it, or make paper for it, but who shove it across the counter and draw in the money, remains, to all that look at it in this point of view, one of the most astonishing ever seen in Human Commerce; and seems to me, in these days, destined to speedy abrogation when once the Public has got eye on it.</p>
<p>My own interest in the business, I confess, is not of a lively nature; nor are my hopes for the world, from such a revolution, what they once might have been: but such is, and has long been, my view of the case now come in hand. No duty being done to Literature but a shopkeeping one, let us have at least <pb id="pg-27-102" n="27:102"/>the eligible kind of shopkeeping,&#x2014;your 55 per cent reduced gradually (as we find it in America just now) to 15 or 10; with Books about half the price they now bear, and with 20 times or 40 times as many readers to them as now. After that, we shall see!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>The inclosed Note has been sent to me by Mr Emerson, from Margaret Fuller&#x2019;s Mother,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margarett Fuller.</note> with earnest charges about conveying it safe to you, and assisting what I can in the matter it relates to.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-103" n="27:103"/>I hope you will give me the satisfaction of knowing straightway that you have got the letter; and certainly if there is anything I could do towards helping forward, in any way, such a pious enterprise as I understand this to be, I should be very ready to do my best.</p>
<p>Had I known your address I should have ventured on the liberty to call on you myself but this conveyance by Mr Woolner<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Woolner.</note> seems equally sure.</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Poor Cochrane died yesterday morning,&#x2014;&#x201C;Tuesday about 8 o&#x2019;clock.&#x201C; No possibility of recovery was understood to exist for some time back, and the Dr was surprised day after day, for the last three, to find him still alive. Poor old lumbering good-natured soul, I am sad to think of him, and that we shall never see him more.&#x2014; Jones<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Edward Jones.</note> will summon a Com̅<hi rend="italic">ee</hi> Meeting
so soon as the funeral is over: I know not in the least what they mean to do; but suppose they will find it good to be in no haste, but to pause well and to examine. Whatever Jones is fit for, he is likely to get; being in good esteem and favour with everybody.</p>
<p>On Monday he told me the Darwin Paper had <hi rend="italic">come;</hi> yesterday I went to Radford the &#x2019;Bacconist&#x2019;s,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably S. B.

I know not whether you have yet written to Jones for your Books: but all else is in such readiness as I describe.</p>
<p>Pray send me back that Emerson Letter; it is not yet answered, nor has the receipt (by Miss Gillies) of the Enclosure yet been acknowledged.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have got a beggarly little cold again, in this grim N. wind weather; and am besieging <pb id="pg-27-104" n="27:104"/>it today with diet (i.e. starvation) blue-pill &#x26;c &#x26;c.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>

<p>I send the <hi rend="italic">Chorley Mss.</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Chorley had taken the drafts about Cromwell and his times that TC had not used for <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, recopied them, and returned both to TC in <date when="1851-03-00">March 1851</date>; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510101-TC-MAC-01"><sic>26:1&#x2013;2</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1851-01-01">1 Jan. 1851</date></corr></ref>. The whereabouts of Chorley&#x2019;s transcript is not known; TC&#x2019;s original drafts are Strouse MSS. It may be that, at this time, Forster sorted out his own collection of TC&#x2019;s drafts for Cromwell, the Forster MSS, now FC: MSS, long unknown because miscatalogued; see K. J.

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>I cannot bear that you should think me <hi rend="italic">slow</hi> in answering your kind and I cannot tell you how welcome letter&#x2014;so I sit down to write just risen out of my bed, and holding my face with one hand; being in severe pain with the faceach&#x2014; It is four or five days that I have been in and out of bed, <hi rend="italic">kneeling</hi> before <pb id="pg-27-105" n="27:105"/>chairs, walking desperately about the room, trying all ways of bearing this gnawing pain which prevents me from either eating or sleeping&#x2014; Lady Airlie (<hi rend="italic">Blanche Stanley</hi> whom you remember) made me go with her last Friday to Camden town in an <hi rend="italic">open</hi> carriage to call for Miss Mulock the Authoress of <hi rend="italic">the Oglvies, Head of the Family</hi> &#x26;c<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dinah Maria Mulock, <hi rend="italic">The Ogilvies</hi>, 3 vols.

Miss Mulock was much amused seemingly at this aristocratic vagary, <hi rend="italic">looked down</hi> on the Lady Airlie who like all romantic women had chosen to sit on &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a low seat</hi>&#x201C; beside her, with an expression of <hi rend="italic">humourous condescension!</hi> and answered her questions as if she had been some precocious <hi rend="italic">child!</hi> I keeping silence till Blanche got on the subject of &#x201C;Husband<supplied>[s]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> who have married women of superior minds to there own&#x201C;&#x2014;and then I told Miss Mulock &#x201C;not to let that young Lady talk nonsense about her husband to her&#x2014;that her Husband was quite a different person from what she led people to suppose&#x201C;!!! &#x201C;Let us hear&#x201C; said Blanche quite goodhumouredly&#x2014;&#x201C;do tell us what he is!!!&#x201C; &#x201C;He is young and handsome and gentlemanly&#x201C; I said&#x2014;is very unpresuming, very affectionate looking, very silent and shy&#x2014;but what he does say is sensible!&#x201C; &#x201C;Dear me interrupted Blanche I shall tell him all that&#x2014;he will be quite pleased!&#x201C; Did you ever hear of such a foolish creature?</p>
<p>On the way home she put her arm round my neck and begged me &#x201C;not to be angry&#x201C;&#x2014;that she &#x201C;didn&#x2019;t mean to speak against Airlie&#x2014;only against the Sportsman class generally&#x201C;! But I can give you no idea of her indiscretion nor of the charm of beauty and childlikeness that makes one always pardon her&#x2014; What we have to do with her here is as the involuntary cause of all this pain in my face&#x2014;and teeth&#x2014;</p>
<p>I shivered all the way home and in the course of the night awoke wild&#x2014;and have been going on more or less wild ever since&#x2014;obliged to give up a great party at Bath house last night&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was the compensation rather than a sacrifice&#x2014;</p>
<p>Indeed dear Helen I was heartily glad to see your clear, Lady like, handwriting on the back of a letter to me again and very grateful to you for writing at such length tho you were quite mistaken if you made a point of saying next to nothing about your health from the idea that anything else could be more interesting to me&#x2014; Understand this another time&#x2014;that what you think and feel about <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>, if it do yourself no harm to write it, is just what I should like best to read, and <hi rend="italic">sometimes</hi> it does one good to speak ones inmost feelings&#x2014;tho oftenest harm I believe&#x2014;</p>
<p>The German scheme is lying quiet only now and then such phrases as &#x201C;it <pb id="pg-27-106" n="27:106"/>will do till we go to Germany&#x201C; &#x201C;When we go to Germany we will &#x26;c&#x201C; strikes a sudden terror into my mind&#x2014; For a little while well and good&#x2014;but for a whole year to have nothing to fall back upon under his and my own <hi rend="italic">gloom!</hi> Mercy that <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be awful!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Geraldine desired me to tell you &#x201C;how very sorry she was to hear of your having been so ill again&#x201C;&#x2014; I hear from her but seldom at present, she has been in one of her perverse phases. which however is passing<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury wrote, 11 to <date when="1852-05-14">14 May</date>: &#x201C;Just one line to ask you how you are after that precious expedition to the dentist&#x2019;s. &#x2026; I could not have gone like you in an omnibus, with my mind made up to the prospect of losing a tooth. &#x2026; Has that sickness and headache at all slackened? &#x2026; As to your servant, what you say about her virtues makes me think it is quite time to get rid of her. &#x2026; What is that your cousin says about your going away to Germany for a year? I have heard nothing beyond the possibility of a month with Lady <supplied>[Harriet]</supplied>&#x201C; (Ireland 436&#x2013;37).</note>&#x2014; &#x201C;The fact is I believe&#x201C; (as Darwin said the other day when I complained of some man being grown disagreeable) &#x201C;The fact is I believe we are all getting rather old!&#x201C;&#x2014; And the wind has also been very long in the east&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I observe makes everybody quarrelsome&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have been in rather intimate relations with the Sketchleys lately&#x2014;Pen was very <hi rend="italic">officious</hi> in seeking superfluous charwomen <hi rend="italic">after</hi> I had suited myself in <hi rend="italic">Helps</hi>&#x2014;and now Ann being found equal to the Work I have made over my little girl<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Martha.</note> to them&#x2014;until they get a grown servant&#x2014;they had been without a servant or anything instead for ten days&#x2014;had parted with the large woman because &#x201C;she lied,&#x201C; and &#x201C;was curious,&#x201C; and &#x201C;read novels&#x201C;&#x2014; Pen is painting she says to order at a great rate&#x2014;but the fact is dear Helen, these people live on their&#x2014;&#x201C;difficulties&#x201C;&#x2014;their <hi rend="italic">difficulties</hi> are all their &#x201C;visible means&#x201C;&#x2014; Penny is <hi rend="italic">kissing</hi>-kind with me just now and has asked as a favour that I would <hi rend="italic">sit</hi> to her! she &#x201C;wishes to give me my own picture as a proof of her <hi rend="italic">gratitude</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; I shall sit because if the picture has a shadow of resemblance it will be a great Heavensending<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Germanism: from &#x201C;<foreign>Himmelsendung</foreign>.&#x201C;</note> to the Countess von Reichenbach</p>
<p>Ann is much more effective and obliging than for long before she went away and will do quite well &#x201C;until we go to Germany&#x201C; Especially as I know now of an adorable cook to assist whenever I want her&#x2014;the woman who was with me daily at dinner time and whom I got quite fond of&#x2014;as for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle he will lament her loss I think all the rest of his life</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>I was delighted at the sight of your hand again.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter, <date when="1852-04-14">14 April</date>.</note> My manifold sins against you, involuntary all of them I may well say, are often enough present to my sad thought; and a kind of remorse is mixed with the other sorrow,&#x2014;as if I could have <hi rend="italic">helped</hi> growing to be, by aid of time and destiny, the grim Ishmaelite I am,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An outcast.</note> and so shocking your serenity by my ferocities! I admit, you were like an angel to me, and absorbed in the beautifullest manner all thunderclouds into the depths of your immeasureable Aether;&#x2014;and it is indubitable I love you very well, and have long done, and mean to do. And on the whole you will have to rally yourself into some kind of Correspondence with me again; I believe you will find that also to be a commanded duty by and by! To me at any rate, I can say, it is a great want, and adds perceptibly to the sternness of these years: deep as is my dissent from your Gymnosophist<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471227-TC-CR-01"><sic>22:184</sic><corr>TC to CR, <date when="1847-12-27">27 Dec. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> view of Heaven and Earth, I find an agreement that swallows up all conceivable dissents; in the whole world I hardly get, to my spoken human word, any other word of response which is authentically <hi rend="italic">human.</hi> God help us, this is growing a very lonely place, this distracted dogkennel of a world! And it is no joy to me to see it about to have its throat cut for its immeasureable devilries; that is not a pleasant process to be concerned in either more or less,&#x2014;considering above all how many centuries, bare and dismal all of them, it is like to take! Nevertheless <foreign><hi rend="italic">marchons</hi></foreign> [let us go on],&#x2014;and swift too, if we have any speed, for the sun is sinking.</p>
<p>I flatter myself I have managed poor Miss Fuller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Mss.</hi> with good success. Miss Gillies, except almost by name, was not known to me, and my first inquiries after her were not quite prosperous; however in a couple of days I easily got a sure hand to convey to her Mrs Fuller&#x2019;s Note inclosed in a civil one of mine; to which there came the answer here sent you (to be shewn to Mrs Fuller, by way of explaining Miss Gillies&#x2019;s sentiments and procedure in this business,&#x2014;pray do not neglect that); and, in fine, by duly expediting matters I shall in few minutes have on the <pb id="pg-27-108" n="27:108"/>road a messenger to meet Miss Gillies at a given hour, and take delivery for me, with due &#x201C;receipts&#x201C; &#x26;c, of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">ipsissimum Corpus</hi></foreign> [very substance] of the packet in question: and I hope to be able to tell you before the Post close (this being American Post-day) that it is actually in my possession here,&#x2014;nay I am not quite certain but I might manage to get it delivered to Chapman, and have it safely put on the road to America by the same Steamer that goes today. This, however, owing to long distances and shortness of time, is by no means so certain: the rather as I am unable to stir in my own person, having the vilest dose of cold I can remember for many years back,&#x2014;sad fruit of this withering east-wind, which is afflicting all Europe as well as me. Nay, on looking at my watch, I rather fear it is not now possible to get Chapman brought into play for this night: against next friday I shall engage to have the Packet, with due sureties and precautions, in his hand; and will write to you another Note then to that effect.</p>
<p>Poor Margaret,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fuller, Countess Ossoli.</note> that is a strange tragedy that history of hers; and has many traits of the Heroic in it, tho&#x2019; it is wild as the prophecy of a sybil. Such a predetermination to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> this big universe as her oyster<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Merry Wives of Windsor</hi> 2.2.</note> or her egg, and to be absolute empress of all height and glory in it that her heart could conceive, I have not before seen in any human soul. Her &#x201C;mountain <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x201C; indeed:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his part of the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli</hi> (Boston, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>), Emerson said: &#x201C;Margaret occasionally let slip, with all the innocence imaginable, some phrase betraying the presence of a rather mountainous ME&#x201C; (1:236).</note>&#x2014;but her courage too is high and clear, her chivalrous nobleness indeed is great; her veracity, in its deepest sense, <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; toute &#xE9;preuve</hi></foreign> [unflinching].&#x2014; Your copy of the Book came to me at last (to my joy): I had already read it; there was considerable notice taken of it here; and <hi rend="italic">one</hi> half-volume of it (and I grieve to say only one, written by a man called Emerson) was completely approved by me and innumerable judges.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote or ed. about half vol. 1; other parts were ed. by W. H. Channing and J. F. Clarke. The English edn., in 3 vols., was widely reviewed. The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, for example, gave seven and a quarter columns, <date when="1852-02-07">7 Feb.</date>, and seven cols., <date when="1852-02-14">14 Feb.</date></note> The rest of the Book is not without considerable geniality and merits: but one wanted a clear concise Narrative beyond all other merits; and if you ask here (except in that half volume) about any fact, you are answered (so to speak) not in words, but by a symbolic tune on the bagpipe, symbolic burst of wind-music from the brass band;&#x2014;which is not the plan at all!&#x2014; &#x2014; What can have become of Mazzini&#x2019;s Letter which he certainly did write and despatch to you is not easily conceivable.

But we never heard from either of them. Lately I learned &#x2026; that Browning &#x2026; did write &#x26; send a memoir to this Country,&#x2014;to whom, I know not.

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>I beg a thousand pardons: I perceive, your former Letter, not judged to be very pressing, had fallen aside, and has never been answered at all! You may believe me it was not indifference to the honour done me, nor want of good will to the object you have in view. But this perverse east wind has quite lamed me, of late; and I have been too willing to shirk any writing, or other duty, that was not quite peremptory.</p>
<p>How the <hi rend="italic">wind</hi> may blow eleven days hence, we cannot say; but I have too clearly no prospect of being at once well enough and disengaged enough to do myself such a pleasure as you propose for the 18<hi rend="italic">th;</hi> and must therefore, with much regret, and with many cordial thanks, beg to be excused on that occasion.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A meeting promoted by the Soc. of Arts, at 18 John St., Adelphi. The soc. had agreed to develop &#x201C;special departments of Industrial Literature, particularly those including the Arts of Design, Manufactures, Commerce, and the Applied Sciences&#x201C; (advert. <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1852-05-22">22 May</date>). At the meeting, chaired by the Marquess of Lansdowne, more than 200 representatives from mechanics&#x2019; institutes and similar institutions voted to combine with the soc. to promote &#x201C;the cultivation of literature, science, and art, and &#x2026; the diffusion of useful knowledge,&#x201C; and passed three allied resolutions. Next day, the soc. received, discussed, and accepted the resolutions, with some modification. A delegation presented the facts of the union to Prince Albert, who expressed interest in its success (<hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1852-05-22">22 May</date>).</note></p>

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>I must write you a word; but with such a dirty sputtering <hi rend="italic">pen</hi>, and so many other impediments, I must be as brief as possible.</p>
<p>The Books, I conclude, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go off on Saturday or even Friday; but, owing to my <hi rend="italic">hygienic</hi> state, I was not able to look after the affair farther at all, being a <hi rend="italic">close</hi> prisoner during both those days, and still only a kind of prisoner at large, and on good behaviour. I sent up <hi rend="italic">Esquirol</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably <hi rend="italic">Des Maladies Mentales, consid&#xE9;r&#xE9;es sous les rapports m&#xE9;dical, hygi&#xE9;nique et m&#xE9;dico-l&#xE9;gal</hi>, 2 vols. (Paris, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), trans. E. K. Hunt, <hi rend="italic">Mental Maladies. A Treatise on Insanity</hi> (Philadelphia, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>); the original work was by Jean &#xc6;tienne Dominique Esquirol (<date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), a well-known French alienist who championed a humane approach to treating the mentally ill. This was a speciality of John Carlyle; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260307-JBW-JAC-01"><sic>4:55</sic><corr>JBW to JAC, <date when="1826-03-07">7 March 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note> by a messenger I was otherwise employing about the Margaret Fuller concern, and that was all I could manage to do.&#x2014; My cold, this time, has not been quite so slight as last; of which my own over-haste has been the main blame. The attack with blue-pill &#x26;c was intrinsically successful, and had I lain dormant two days instead of one, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> probably have ended the matter; but on the second day (Thursday) I rashly strolled up to the Library, talked with various people; lived on cups of brown soup instead of glasses of toast-and-water; and in short, made myself a bad feverish night, and needed no warning to be quiet <hi rend="italic">next</hi> day and for eight-and-forty hours to come! At that point, however, the evening again fled in disorder; a teaspoonful of paregoric,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An opiate painkiller.</note> the only drug I used besides a dreadful bath of <hi rend="italic">sweating</hi> in bed, procured me six hours of &#x201C;the sleep of an infant,&#x201C; and I awoke restored of morning with a first feeling of clear health, tho&#x2019; with great weakness as was fit. I had my bath again wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had been discontinued for 2 days, and a little walk in the bright sunshine, in my clean flannels, and sabbath thankfulnesses;&#x2014;and in brief am going on towards perfect recovery ever since, and shall take good care of myself this time. Today again I am rigorously <foreign><hi rend="italic">au s&#xE8;cret</hi></foreign> [in seclusion]; having, in spite of my wishes and precautions, fallen into some extent of talk, the <hi rend="italic">least</hi> quantity of which I find is ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me. My assiduous little &#x201C;medical adviser,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC.</note> she keeps watch and ward over me, and drives back all enemies whatsoever.&#x2014; These things you can report to my Mother, lest she is in any way fretting herself about me. I <hi rend="italic">now</hi> see this cold, with its seat in the liver and adjoining regions has been coming on for many weeks, nay for several months; and I expect to be perceptibly better than the former average when once I am clear. A little whiffling cough now <pb id="pg-27-111" n="27:111"/>alone remains to me; and the skin is doing its duty as if by double-tides. This is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.&#x2014; Enough of it here.</p>
<p>Of course I will pay at once any accounts of yours you may transmit to me for pay<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,&#x2014;Jones&#x2019;s or others. But none have come to me yet, the very Paper I think must have been paid by Darwin to save time;&#x2014;and indeed I think in general it will be best that they go to you <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, as postage is so cheap.</p>
<p>Poor Jones, I doubt has little chance of advantage from this Library revolution; and on the whole the affair is threatening to take a quite ominous and reprehensible course. Not being able to go myself to Committee, I sent Jane to communicate my notions to Forster: namely that Jones sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be made interim manager; that first of all a thorough examination and illumination of the Library&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">condition</hi>, from the very heart to the surface of it, sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be had,&#x2014;whereby we might know what <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of Librarian might now be the best for us;&#x2014;and that not till after that sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> any Election, or movement towards an Election, be made by any one of us. Forster as I knew he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, patronised all these salutary notions, ready to swear for them on the Koran if needful; but at the same time said, there was not the least hope of getting them carried; or anything but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> carried, viz. the Election of Gladstone&#x2019;s Neapolitan,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. P. Lacaita.</note>&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> G. and his Helpers &#x201C;were stirring Heaven and Earth to bring about; and which from the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> composition of the Committee (Milman, Lyttelton, Milnes, Hallam &#x26;c,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Lyttelton, Henry Hart Milman, and Henry Hallam (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12002"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), historian.</note> a clear majority of malleable material, some of it as soft as butter, under the hammer of a Minister <foreign><hi rend="italic">in posse</hi></foreign> [with that capacity])<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gladstone, not in office, was to be chancellor of the exchequer before the end of the year.</note> they were &#x201C;perfectly certain&#x201C; to do it. With this answer Jane returned; quite of Forster&#x2019;s way of thinking:&#x2014; I had bid her signify to Jones in some kind way that he must not pretend at all to be head Librarian, in case there were one, tho&#x2019; his deserts were known and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be attended to in time and place: this she had no opportunity of telling him, such a bustle was there. What they did at the Com<hi rend="italic">ee</hi> I have not all heard; Forster (who has cold too) has fled out of Town for a week. Gladstone, I think with Forster, will probably succeed: but he shall not do it without one man at least insisting on having Reason and common Honesty as well as Gladstone and Charity at other men&#x2019;s expense, satisfied in the matter; and protesting to a plainly audible extent against the <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> amiable couple walking over the belly of the former.&#x2014; Such protest I am clearly bound to; and that, I believe, will prove to be all that I can do. Of Gladstone&#x2019;s Neapolitan no man, Italian or other, has other<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> heard the name before: from G.&#x2019;s own acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me, I figured him as some ingenuous bookish <pb id="pg-27-112" n="27:112"/>young advocate, who probably had helped G. in his Pamphlets underhand,&#x2014;a useful service, but not done to the L<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Library particularly.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother, I have written far too much! Commend me to my dear Mother, and soon rejoice me again by some good news of her.&#x2014; We have strong west-wind at last; and today some blessed first-sprinklings of actual rain.

<salute>Dear Helps,</salute>
<p>The London Library is in Danger!&#x2014; Your man Ross,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> whom I once saw long ago, and of whom I have heard authentic testimony lately, seems at present decidedly the most promising; but there are already five or six other native candidates, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of them, I fancy, superior in real fitness to the young Neapolitan Advocate just arrived on our shores, whom Gladstone has decided to lead in over the belly of both Rhyme and Reason, and make king over us!&#x2014; I myself am struck down to the Earth with Influenza, incapable of stirring out for near a week past, and forbidden even to speak, above five words in the half hour, under penalties. I sent a message to Forster last Saturday, solemnly admonishing to delay and deliberation; Forster&#x2019;s answer was that he went with me to the letter; but that Gladstone, L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Lyttelton &#x26;c were &#x201C;stirring Heaven and Earth&#x201C; to bring in their man; and that, from the present composition of the Committee, there &#x201C;was not a possibility&#x201C; of hindering them. Forster himself is ill, and gone to the country: here in my prison I cannot even learn from anybody what the Comm<hi rend="italic">ee</hi> did last saturday; but only that this next meeting is to be on Saturday week, when &#x201C;testimonials are to be presented,&#x201C;&#x2014;i.e., I suppose, when G. and his majority are to bring their enterprise to the penultimate, if not even to the triumphant ultimate stage.</p>
<p>To myself all this is a thing evidently contrary to, not the London Library alone, and to its clear interests and rights, but to the Common Honesty of every one of us to whom said interests and rights have been tacitly but most validly delegated for management and supervision; and it is my decision, for one, that I must and will resist it, and try to find or make &#x201C;a possibility&#x201C;: I think, it will be worse for me, if I don&#x2019;t!&#x2014; At all events, I will go before the thing end, and in some softest but perfectly audible way <hi rend="italic">protest</hi> ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> such a proceeding, and refusing absolutely, I for one, to have any hand in it more or less, openly dismiss myself from the Com̅<hi rend="italic">ee</hi> before they proceed to so untenable an operation. This alone, you perceive, will be but a poor measure; but better than this, on various sides, are open to us;&#x2014;and in fact, I find, in my solitary contemplations here, that there are decided &#x201C;possibilities&#x201C; (<foreign><hi rend="italic">pace</hi></foreign> Forster), and that if there were not, such must be <hi rend="italic">made</hi>,&#x2014;and must be prosecuted with despatch and to the utmost!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-114" n="27:114"/>The first of all, dear Helps, is that <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, quite gently and with habitual reticence, come up to Town, and lodge yourself within reach of me, the earlier the better, but at least a week before next Com<hi rend="italic">ee</hi> meeting. Unless actually held, as I myself am, you are actually bound to this,&#x2014;somewhat as your Groom w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be if he saw one of your horses about to be stolen by a <foreign>cadger</foreign>, and c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> prevent it by a little running! My remaining capabilities of speech shall all be devoted to you; and before the day come, I hope to be myself on my feet again.</p>
<p>These things I have written, dear Helps, to &#x201C;liberate my soul.&#x201C; I have no Candidate of my own; on the whole, no wish in the matter except that what is honest be done by the Com<hi rend="italic">ee</hi>, and especially by one poor member of it;&#x2014;and, sure enough, Gladstone might saddle Kossuth or King Bomba<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ferdinand II (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>), king of the two Sicilies, so-called because he bombarded Sicilian cities, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>.</note> on the L.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am so very unwell (labouring under Influenza), and so very busy, I have never yet found time to acknowledge your Cromwell letter and other favours.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The whole letter is in JWC&#x2019;s hand, except for the final signature and the name of the addressee that follows it.</note></p>
<p>I am always thankful for any authentic contributions or corrections on the subject of Cromwell: since Carey<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC means Henry Carey, <hi rend="italic">Memorials of the Great Civil War in England &#x2026; Edited from Letters in the Bodleian Library</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>). He had made good use of John Forster&#x2019;s copy for the 1st edn.; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420100-TC-JF-01"><sic>14:3</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1842-01-01">1 Jan. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> is so inexact, I should be very glad to have him corrected so far as Cromwell goes; and if there were any perfectly trustworthy person attainable in the Bodleian (where I myself never was) should be happy to treat with him for that small service.</p>
<p>Your Cromwell Letter relates to the Expedition of Hispaniola; and is one of several which he sent to his Parliament on that subject. I see trace of <pb id="pg-27-115" n="27:115"/>another on the <date when="0000-10-09">9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> October</date>; of which, as of this and all the rest, there was equally no notice taken by the &#x201C;Pedant Parliament.&#x201C; Speaker Lenthall must have had almost a sinecure of it on this occasion; the House sitting almost daily in Committee, hatching the Constitution which never came to anything.</p>
<p>Your Ancestor appears to have been a man of firstrate legal abilities; distinguished for his prudence, adroitness, and general propriety of behaviour in a very difficult time. To give some brief, lucid and <hi rend="italic">authentic</hi> record of such a Life is a pious enterprise on your part; and will be a welcome service to every lover of English History.</p>

He, Gladstone, I hear, reappeared suddenly, after 10 years absence, in the Committee, on Saturday last; and has resolved to bring in some interesting young Neapolitan gentleman, much out of funds at present; and it is asserted farther, such is the present composition of the Com̅<hi rend="italic">ee</hi>, he is sure of a majority there for whatever <hi rend="italic">his</hi> fixed pleasure is; and that in short there is &#x201C;not the least possibility&#x201C; (such was the phrase) of hindering him from marching in this young Neapolitan over the belly of whatever opposes him.&#x2014; To the rescue! To the rescue! I myself am utterly on my beam-ends, masts cut by the board (under Influenza, fell Horror), this week past, and cannot stir from the spot; in fact, can do nothing, hardly even pray.</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>This day week, by our last Steamer, there went tidings of my successful negociation on the Margaret-Fuller Packet of Papers; and, had my messenger returned fifteen minutes earlier than he did from the Gillies quarter, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have despatched him express for John Chapman&#x2019;s in the Strand (the hour still permitting such an enterprise), and you had got the <foreign><hi rend="italic">ipsissimum corpus</hi></foreign> of the Packet, and so had needed, with me at least, no farther correspondence on the subject. That being accidentally or providentially impossible, I engaged at least (by some hurried scrape of the pen somewhere on your Note) to send the Packet off &#x201C;by next steamer,&#x201C;&#x2014;that is, by this which has now its anchor apeak; and which, alas, does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> bring you the Packet, but only another set of papers and talking about it. Heaven send, the work do prove to be at last <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> all the cry there has been upon it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have the Packet*<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote the words in parentheses at the top of the page.</note> (Loose Package in brown paper, tied with string, and sealed (by M. F.):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Fuller.</note> dimensions 10 inches by 3 and by 7&#xBD;; weight 3 lbs minus 1&#xBD; oz.) here safe, and will keep it so till we hear your decision on the subject: but the Misses Gillies, startled still farther by a Note in M<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Fullers hand, which, till they tore off the outer cover (loose cover with their own address on it, and supposed to contain nothing more), they had never seen,&#x2014;will in nowise consent to part altogether with this Packet so entrusted to them; and indeed appear to be pretty much convinced, in spite of all I can say and argue, that the Papers ought to be <hi rend="italic">burned</hi> straightway, and act taken to that effect, and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> the matter finished. By the Notes here sent, which are now <hi rend="italic">all</hi> I ever got from Miss Gillies, you will perceive how they have got into the field of pious punctilio and &#x201C;Pike&#x2019;s cases of Conscience&#x201C; (so to speak),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Pike and S. Hayward, <hi rend="italic">Some Important Cases of Conscience Answered</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1755-00-00">1755</date>&#x2013;<date when="1756-00-00">56</date>).</note> and are not likely ever to get quite out of it, except on pressure of gentle violence from the right quarter, if even then. I ought to add that they are most respectable, <pb id="pg-27-117" n="27:117"/>and even I understand, amiable and intelligent Ladies,&#x2014;perhaps the very wisest we have of that advanced Progress-of-the species sort, which prudent persons in this country are shy of having much to do with:&#x2014;Mary Gillies, who came here last Saturday to &#x201C;burn&#x201C; those Papers along with me, quite gained our hearts by her mild wise ways and manners; a tall, serene, really beautiful old-maid of five-and-forty; and I understand her sister the Paintress (whom owing to Progress of the Species I have hitherto not seen) is an equally brave gentle and superior lady. To Margaret Fuller&#x2019;s Packet of Papers their conduct has been that of Priestesses towards a sacred relic,&#x2014;truly such, I do believe;&#x2014;and it is very clear to me, if M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fuller<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard, Margaret&#x2019;s brother; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520625-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1852-06-25">25 June</date></ref>.</note> wrote them <hi rend="italic">objurgatorily</hi> on the subject, it was much undeserved, and ought to be loyally retracted, and replaced by <hi rend="italic">thanks</hi>, on the first opportunity. As indeed I have predicted that it would.</p>
<p>To these guardian Ladies I have urged, in writing, orally, and again in writing, with all my eloquence: That M. Fuller&#x2019;s &#x201C;order&#x201C; with regard to these Papers (if we will look beyond the mere letter of it, and into the real spirit of it) <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> now be fulfilled by any power human or divine; that there was attached to it a tacit but most vital condition, of <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> to be observed concerning it and them, so that complete annihilation might ensue; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> condition having now been irretrievably violated, the very gods cannot &#x201C;annihilate&#x201C; these Papers. &#x201C;Miss Mary and I,&#x201C; I have urged, &#x201C;can burn the Papers in 2 minutes or less; any body can so easily destroy the Papers: but who of gods or man can destroy the melancholy Ghost (or wailing, suspecting, imagining Memory) of them, which will walk the world as goblin in a distracted manner till all memory of Margaret herself die?&#x201C; Her real will can only be complied with now, and her Papers annihilated so far as <hi rend="italic">now</hi> possible, by their being competently <hi rend="italic">examined</hi> before burning, and pronounced to be of no importance, and to deserve and need the fire. On the whole, her Mother is the true heir of them; her Mother, and such a Council of Friends, Emerson, Channing, Mrs Channing,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably William Henry Channing (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), one of the editors, and Ellen Kilshaw Channing (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>), Margaret&#x2019;s sister, m. <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> William Ellery Channing (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1901-00-00">1901</date>).</note> these of all persons discoverable under this sun are the real tribunal to sit in judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> on them: to decide on burning them unseen, or with what <hi rend="italic">degree</hi> of sight and examination, it is fit to burn them. I urged also, &#x201C;Be <hi rend="italic">speedy!</hi> The Papers probably are of <hi rend="italic">no</hi> moment whatever: if a churchyard spectre is threatening to walk the parish, and developing itself into pale valleys of Jehosaphat and Battles of Armageddon,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The last great battle before the final judgment; see Rev. 16:16.</note>&#x2014;walk instantly up to it, tumble the pole and white sheet about their business, if you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> end it.&#x201C;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-118" n="27:118"/>These considerations I have urged with emphasis, I cannot say with much success; at length finding the matter unlike to end that way, and every Note at present costing <hi rend="italic">me</hi> a headache,&#x2014;I announced to Miss Gillies 3 days ago that her sister&#x2019;s final proposal of Saturday last sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be adopted; viz. That the whole matter sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be referred to Margaret Fuller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi> &#x26; her council at Concord; that whatever that venerable Lady, so advised, sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> decide upon, I w<hi rend="italic">d endeavour</hi> to get done for her (with which I <hi rend="italic">hoped</hi> Miss G<hi rend="italic">s</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> cooperate); and that <hi rend="italic">till</hi> such decision arrived, there sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be absolute silence on the subject. I gave Miss G. <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Address at Concord, and directed all her farther pleadings, if any to go thither: my judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> was quite made up, no Notes or headaches farther needed from me.&#x2014; &#x2014; Tell me, then, what to do. I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> Mrs Fuller&#x2019;s order will produce compliance from Miss G.; I will try my best to bring it so about; and only yield to some absolute <hi rend="italic">Pike&#x2019;s case</hi>, or Female Denunciation fronting me with arms a-kimbo. The Papers, I guess after all, are probably of little or no moment; but my tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> is as above that they sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be examined a little in order to annihilate the &#x201C;ghosts&#x201C; there too. Do as you find good;&#x2014;forget not to send back Margaret&#x2019;s scrap of paper to Miss Gillies, and some acknowledgment that she has behaved, been loyally eager to behave, with fidelity and piety in the matter.</p>
<p>I have a vile influenza for the last week; which lames me from all work, especially from all <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi>,&#x2014;or from writing a word beyond what is indispensable. About Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Great and other high matters shortly. <closer><salute>Advice dear Friend: good be with you always.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>If you are in want of a Political Secretary, let me advise you to investigate the claims of the present aspirant, Mr Espinasse,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Espinasse.</note> whom I have long known as a man of extensive accurate scholarship and information, of sharp insight, of great exactness and fidelity,&#x2014;in short, of many faculties and acquisitions superior to what are usually in the market in such cases. He has been twice in similar situations; I believe, with good approval from his chiefs: and it strikes me, the severe rigour of his intellect, placed under the sunny and wide-flowing humanities of yours, might perhaps be found to suit even better than hitherto.</p>

<salute>My dear John</salute>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, in going off to drive <hi rend="italic">in an open carriage</hi> with Lord Ashburton, told me to write you a few lines to say we were here&#x2014; It is not precisely thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">my</hi> choice that we are here&#x2014; I had settled that we were to go to Sandgate,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bathing resort in Kent, nr.

Fairish said his pulse was very weak and ordered him quinine and sea air if he could but agree to go&#x2014;and it was fortified by this prescription that I had persuaded him into consenting to go to Sandgate</p>
<p>The quinine seems to be agreeing with him extremely well&#x2014; His appetite is excellent now&#x2014;and, his sleep pretty good&#x2014;and if he would only go on letting himself be <hi rend="italic">nursed</hi> I think he would soon be better than for a long time before this Influenza came on&#x2014;but you know his ways!

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I am sorry to have fallen under the just suspicion of stealing your beautiful <hi rend="italic">caduceus</hi>, or twisted stick, yesterday at my departure: I did not notice it till we were in the cab, halfway to the station and no time to return. It shall be left at Bath House this ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> or tomorrow.</p>
<p>We got perfectly well home; and I had a silent afternoon, not interrupted by the Furies, if a stranger to the rosy Hours; and finally an excellent sleep, rocked by the loud tumult of the east-wind, which had grown to copious batterings of rain this morning. What a day for the Derby,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Derby Day is at the races at Epsom, 14 mi. SSW of London, this year the Wed. before Whitsun.</note>&#x2014;for her Ladyship&#x2019;s bright new carpets above all! You can report that I put the Letters in, before two o&#x2019;clock yesterday, in a Town Post-Office.</p>
<p>Except a weakness which seems fitter for a sparrow than for a man,&#x2014;or which might, in the language not of flattery be defined as a transcendent <pb id="pg-27-121" n="27:121"/>laziness,&#x2014;I have now no disease to complain of; and these sad residues will go gradually too, I hope.</p>
<p><closer><salute>I send many regards to My Lady and Sambo:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a dog.</note> bid you take good care of yourself in the middle of the tumults; and am always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We came home from Addiscombe yesterday, after nearly a week of country, under what may be considered the most favourable circumstances. I was twice on horseback, I had the most perfect groves and green places to saunter in; &#x201C;change of air,&#x201C; the sovereign remedy, may fairly be said to have been <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> in my case, and now I shall at least no longer be bothered with talk about that.&#x2014; The truth is, I am quite free of my disease; only unusually torpid in the bowels, and weak and lazy, of which ailments I do not expect to get rid by &#x201C;change of air,&#x201C; but only by careful regimen, precaution and attention continued for some space of time.&#x2014; Last night I confess I was very glad to see my old quiet curtained bed again; and indeed I had a first-rate sleep, better greatly than any I had realised since last there.&#x2014; Today has been a copious east-wind rain, which perhaps is yet hardly ended: a beautiful accompaniment to the Epsom solemnities of the Derby Day! I calculate on getting out for a bit of walk; which, under due limits, I believe to be the one real remedy for me. You can assure my dear Mother that I am perfectly well, except this torpor in the inside, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is gradually giving way; and that she need not disturb her imagination about me at all, at all.</p>
<p>There are now 250 Candidates for the London Library! Among them is Jones (as he writes to me yesterday, note <hi rend="italic">lost</hi>), who has not, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think, any chance whatever, there being several really superior persons in the field. A Subcommittee (fair enough names, all) is to sift down the 250, and report, I do not know when. The Gladstone Neapolitan, it is thought, is now far over the horizon,&#x2014;no fear of him at any rate. Enough, dear Brother; for I have still various Notes to write, and by no means like writing. <closer><salute>My blessings to my dear old Mother; my love and regards to you all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Redwood,</salute>
<p>There is no Wales for me at present. We have been a week in the Country, where y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter reached us, thanks to your ever-hospitable heart: we returned yesterday; and having now <hi rend="italic">exhausted</hi> the miracle of &#x201C;change of air&#x201C; which all the world bothers you with as sovereign and immediate in such cases, I decide that it will be clearly expedient to keep within my own shop thro&#x2019; the future stages of this business. The hours of sleepless nights &#x26;c &#x26;c, inevitable for me in all stranger houses, are a sufficient monition to be content with what &#x201C;air&#x201C; (among other things) is attainable at home!&#x2014; The fact is, I consider the disease to be as good as altogether gone; and the weakness &#x26;c that remain can only disappear gradually by the aid of time and care.</p>
<p>It was very sad not to see you that evening, on your annual or biennial visit! But in fact, if one is, in search of sadness, there is no want of that anywhere, and the only course in general is to hold one&#x2019;s tongue.&#x2014; A little fraction of work, precious fraction saved like gold from the general blazing fire of human follies, ought to be possible for everybody who is still alive: alas, the true misery is, to be deprived even of this, and to see one&#x2019;s own days too going up in idle conflagration like those of the general fools of this world! Patience, patience,&#x2014;silence at least.</p>
<p>As I have many Notes to write, and all writing has still a tendency to give me headache, I cease for the present; and dismiss you with my thanks and blessings. When I shall see Boverton<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Redwood had moved; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461229-TC-CR-01"><sic>21:86<!-- actually 21:121 --></sic><corr>TC to CR, <date when="1846-12-29">29 Dec. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> again, or whether ever, is greatly uncertain; but that I should forget it or you, while I am anywhere in the world, is not very possible. Nay it is a real and continual possession to me, tho&#x2019; I never see it more.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I received your two Notes, with the Osborne literature on cheap bread;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably by the Rev. Sidney Godolphin Osborne (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889-00-00">89</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20883"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), rector of Durweston, Dorset, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">75</date>, who as &#x201C;S.G.O.&#x201C; often wrote to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on various agricultural, social, educational, and other matters; he also wrote various works on social conditions.</note> and was very glad to hear of you again. Unluckily just in those days I had <pb id="pg-27-123" n="27:123"/>caught a despicable fit of Influenza, which quite put a negative on any writing, the shortest Note costing me a headache: we have since been in the country for a week, back only yesterday; and tho&#x2019; the special disease appears to be gone, there remains a degree of feebleness, laziness, and general torpor, which is still much in my way, and of which I can only hope to get rid by the aid of assiduous precautions and exertions continued for some length of time. Writing, especially, is still a thing that I avoid as much as may be. Indeed all labour whatsoever is unusually irksome to me.</p>
<p>I got Fitzgeral&#x2019;s two little Books;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward FitzGerald (TC omits the &#x201C;d&#x201C;), <hi rend="italic">Polonius</hi> (<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>) and probably <hi rend="italic">Euphranor</hi> (<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>). FitzGerald wrote to a friend, <date when="1852-06-08">8 June</date>, that he had been in London several times in the past three weeks, but &#x201C;Carlyle I did not go to see, for I really have nothing to tell him, and I have got tired of hearing him growl: though I do not cease to admire him as much as ever&#x201C; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 2:56).</note> which please me very well in their kind. Of our new Hebrew Chancellor of the Exchequer<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Disraeli.</note> I say nothing, and think as little as may be. This new triumph of the Art of wagging the Tongue is the highest yet achieved in this realm of Britain, and seems to me to mark an epoch in our destinies, little comfortable to the patriotic mind. This Jew is made of tough material; and may probably enough carry it far yet, if he live. But a Parliament that hitches up dead dogs to the top of it, if they can but <hi rend="italic">talk</hi>, what is to become of such Parliament, and of the Country that depends on it! Given a dead dog, is he not doubly damnable and malodorous <hi rend="italic">because</hi> he can withal talk! He ought at least to be silent, the scandalous carrion, having <hi rend="italic">no</hi> wisdom, nobleness, or life of any kind, but only the sad <hi rend="italic">reverse</hi> of all that, to impart to his bewildered fellow creatures, God help them and him! I for one propose to have no trade with him or his affairs, unless they mend miraculously.</p>
<p>Let us see you when you come to Town; and bid the Dr<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> call on us again, as he promised. <closer><salute>Yours always truly</salute></closer></p>

Chambers replied to TC, <date when="1852-05-31">31 May</date>: &#x201C;There is no ballad called Childe Etin, but there is one called Hynde Etin, which you will find in Chambers&#x2019;s Scottish Ballads [Edinburgh,] <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>. &#x2026; In my Popular Rhymes of Scotland [Edinburgh, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>] the tale of the Red Etin was first printed&#x2014;a totally different thing from the ballad, as you will see by a copy which I enclose.&#x201C; As a result, TC revised <hi rend="italic">Heroes and Hero-Worship</hi> (4th edn., [<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>]) from &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Childe Etin</hi> in the Scottish Ballads is a Norse Mythus&#x201C; to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Hynde Etin</hi>, and still more decisively <hi rend="italic">Red Etin of Ireland</hi>, in the Scottish Ballads, these are both derived from Norseland&#x201C;; see <hi rend="italic">Heroes;</hi> ed. M. K. Goldberg and others (Berkeley, Calif., <date when="1993-00-00">1993</date>) 32, 252&#x2013;53.

There is likely to be a great cheapening of books by and by, and an immense increase of reading in consequence,&#x2014;which if it were certain that we should get truth and sense to read, or if it were all one (as it is to a dreadful degree all <hi rend="italic">two</hi>) whether we read sense and truth or falsity and nonsense, would be an indisputable benefit for mankind!

<p>I myself have been very ill since you saw me: vile influenza, with two relapses, each bringing me much deeper into the slough; utter weakness, comparable to that of a water-wagtail;&#x2014;in fine we were obliged to fly into the country, and apply to <hi rend="italic">quinine</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Hippocratica</hi> [medical authorities]; <pb id="pg-27-126" n="27:126"/>came back three days ago, after a week; the disease gone, but the weakness, the transcendent laziness, only going, and that quite at its leisure.

With 250 native Candidates of such a character, it will not be possible to march a miniature Panizzi over the necks of mankind in that way! Whether Helps is in Town or not I do not know.</p>

<salute>Dearest Kate</salute>
<p>I am not at all well, and am like Martha in the Scriptures &#x201C;troubled about many things&#x201C;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luke 10:41.</note> but I must write you a few lines <hi rend="italic">anyhow;</hi> to put that busy little head to rest so far as <hi rend="italic">my displeasure</hi> is concerned. Dear child! I am not displeased with you the least in the world! I might have been sure without asking that the Cap<hi rend="italic">t</hi> was as usual making &#x201C;a tempest in a tea pot&#x201C; for the sole purpose of rendering himself disagreeable&#x2014;the only aim which he seems to steadily pursue at present. For the rest beyond the temporary vexation to myself from being assailed in that illtimed, and ill-natured manner, no harm was probably meant, and no harm has resulted&#x2014;That Capt Sterling from his Englishman point of view should refuse his consent to his niece and wards marriage with a german<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron Dalwig, see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520727-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1852-07-27">27 July</date>]</ref>.</note> was quite natural&#x2014;that he should refuse it <hi rend="italic">before it <pb id="pg-27-127" n="27:127"/>was asked</hi> was like his usual headlongness. Apparently, it <hi rend="italic">never</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">would</hi> have bee<supplied>[n]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> asked&#x2014;the young Lady&#x2019;s own consent being first needed as a preliminary measure, and even <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would never have been asked till the young Lady had given some encouragement to the hope of winning it&#x2014; Baron Dalwig tho&#x2019; no Englishman, has modesty, and delicacy, and also proper pride&#x2014;as I have had occasion to observe&#x2014; And by such a character love &#x201C;with the <hi rend="italic">reciprocity</hi> all on one side&#x201C; (as the Irish say) would soon have been discarded <hi rend="italic">voluntarily</hi> as an impertinent folly. A few words from Plattnauer have been enough to arouse him a sense of what was due to himself in this foolish business. and I daresay he will soon find a wife in his own country if a wife be necessary to his happiness&#x2014;as for Reichenbach <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is &#x201C;extremely thankful&#x201C; that the Capt should have ended the &#x201C;addresses&#x201C; before they were begun&#x2014;not that Reichenbach does not appreciate &#x201C;Miss Kate Sterling&#x201C; but that he augurs ill, like the Capt, of marriages between persons of different countries&#x2014;to which is added a strong feeling of retaliation for the Capt&#x2019;s contempt for foreigners&#x2014; And then Reichenbach, not wasting any of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> faculties in <hi rend="italic">talk</hi>, could better than others see that Miss Kate Sterling did not care a pinch of snuff for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Ward, and therefore his ward, he thought, was but wasting his time in getting up any enthusiasm for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>&#x2014; I must tell you too that we did great injustice to the little Countess that day thro the constructions we&#x2014;or at least I put on her <hi rend="italic">coldness.</hi> the poor little soul was, as she afterwards confessed to me put in &#x201C;a false position&#x201C; from her Husband having found great fault with her for praising you, as she was in the habit of doing to Dalwig, and <hi rend="italic">showing</hi> a liking for you, which he feared was <hi rend="italic">infectious</hi> for the young man&#x2014; Count Reichenbach too told me next day he quite pitied his wife, when he saw her so embarrassed betwixt her liking to <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, and her respect to <hi rend="small-caps">his</hi> wishes. In fact they are all good true-hearted, honourable people&#x2014;and I should not regret having been bothered by the Capt, since it has been the means of letting me see still better than I should have done in ordinary intercourse into their inner hearts.</p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Letter, which gives me much pleasure; thanks also for your new prophecy of Books, which will be very welcome to me when they get across. I wrote to Bunsen Junior, straightway about the conveyance; he answers me, this morning, from the country, that the Aachen convenience is &#x201C;always&#x201C; open to me; that a Courier leaves that place on the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and on the 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of every month:&#x2014;in fact, I had better slit you off the first leaf of his Note, which will completely instruct you on that matter. I will take <hi rend="italic">Nicolai</hi> especially, one of the most authentic of men; <hi rend="italic">Schmettau</hi> also, which I believe to be about soldiering and the Silesian wars, will probably be very useful:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich Wilhelm Carl von Schmettau, <hi rend="italic">&#xdc;ber den Feldzug der preussischen Armee in B&#xF6;hmen im Jahre <date when="1778-00-00">1778</date></hi> (Berlin, <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>), pbd. also as <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires raisonn&#xE9;s sur la Campagne de <date when="1778-00-00">1778</date> en Boh&#xEA;me</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>); see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:200n.</note> in short, we will reject nothing of your List; far from rejecting!&#x2014; If in any of your Bonn shops <pb id="pg-27-129" n="27:129"/>you can find a <hi rend="italic">Stieler&#x2019;s</hi> &#x201C;Hand-atlas&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Deutschland</hi> in 4 Maps, of date <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>),&#x2014;I already possess 2, the N.W. part, and the N.E.; they are exactly the same <hi rend="italic">size</hi> as the newer and much minuter <hi rend="italic">Stieler&#x2019;s</hi> you sent me; and I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like very well to possess the other 2, S.W. and S.E. (probably about 2 /, if they exist),&#x2014;W<hi rend="italic">ms</hi> &#x26; Norgate consider them quite <hi rend="italic">antediluvian</hi> (date <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>), and never heard of them before. By the marks here given you will easily know them (my &#x201C;N.W&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">ends</hi> with Heilbronn, Wurzburg &#x26;c on the right hand corner at the bottom; &#x201C;N.E.&#x201C; has Kissingen, Eger, Prag &#x26;c along the South border),&#x2014;and on the whole don&#x2019;t bother yourself about them, and only try a <hi rend="italic">very little:</hi> and wrap them round some bit of cane, pamphlet or the like, if they are to be had.</p>
<p>I have got full benefit out of all the Books you formerly sent: my old <hi rend="italic">B&#xfc;sching</hi> seems to be the cheapest purchase I ever made,&#x2014;serves me as a German <hi rend="italic">Villars</hi>, or, Topographical Dictionary, and in many other ways. Even <hi rend="italic">Erman</hi> (on F<hi rend="italic">k&#x2019;s</hi> Grandmother) has got himself well read; and the redoutable <hi rend="italic">Nicolai;</hi> champing into powder the nonsense of Ritter Zimmermann, got some kind of blessing from me. I am much in want of some small German, or especially Prussian Namenskatalog, Biog. Dict<hi rend="italic">y</hi> of Official persons, &#x26; other authentic easily consultable Prosopography to tell me <hi rend="italic">Who&#x2019;s who.</hi> So many different Schwerins, Anhalts, swarms of W&#xfc;rtemburg Princes, Margraves of Baireuth, and Anspach, without even a clear date stuck to any of them:&#x2014; Denina&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Prusse Litteraire</hi>, the only help of that kind I have yet got, is as good as no help, or worse, indeed one of the paltriest books ever written, and deserving properly to be <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> out of the way. Nothing even equal to an old English <hi rend="italic">Peerage-book</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, God knows, is no ideal kind of article, have I yet fallen in with. H&#xfc;bner&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Genealogische Tabellen</hi> is in the Museum;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >British Museum. Johann H&#xfc;bner, <hi rend="italic">Genealogische Tabellen, Nebst den dazu geh&#xF6;rigen Genealogischen Fragen, zur Erl&#xE4;uterung der politischen Historie</hi>, 3 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1725-00-00">1725</date>&#x2013;<date when="1728-00-00">28</date>), &#x201C;a Book of rare excellence in its kind&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:61n); TC&#x2019;s copy is in Houghton Lib., Harvard, with signature and date of <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date> in vol. 3.</note> but only to consult, if even that, for I never try to read in the Museum, or even look into it without something of a shudder. On the whole I greatly want something ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Frederic, which w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> tell me all that the barrenest file of contemporary Newspapers could,&#x2014;give me namely an <hi rend="italic">indubitable</hi> basis of <hi rend="italic">Chronology</hi>, as minute as I liked. If you hear of any such thing, be on the watch for it. Preuss&#x2019;s editings are infinitely careful, minutely copious in annotation; but he has withal a dreadful want of the real sense of <hi rend="italic">method</hi>,&#x2014;in fact of sense generally in comparison to the task he has taken up. In editing Frederic&#x2019;s works, for example, he seems to have missed altogether the very obvious truth that except as autobiographic documents about Frederic these are not &#x201C;works&#x201C; at all; and has irremediably jumbled his operation thereby from top to bottom, which is great sorrow to me for one!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-130" n="27:130"/>I cannot say that I make much progress with F<hi rend="italic">k</hi>, or see what relation I can well establish with him; but he does increase in beauty to me, the intrinsic bright sheet-lightning soul of Vater Fritz does,&#x2014;a most brilliant swift-darting, and yet most stable and practical creature, invincible as the very gods;&#x2014;and so I continue to read about him; not being able, in fact, to read at all except in a train and <hi rend="italic">about</hi> something; and the world offering to me, in my present deep silence, nothing else is so inviting. I have even tried what I could to go thro&#x2019; the 5000 Letters of Voltaire<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Marie Arouet, or Voltaire (<date when="1694-00-00">1694</date>&#x2013;<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>), visited the Prussian court at Frederick&#x2019;s invitation, <date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>, until he quarreled with Frederick and departed, <date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>. The London Lib. owned Voltaire&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres</hi> (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>), which included <hi rend="italic">Correspondance</hi>, vols. 31&#x2013;41.</note> for his sake,&#x2014;the Pirithous of that Theseus.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Greek legend Pirithous, king of the Lapithae in Thessaly, was the friend of the great Theseus, king of Athens.</note> Voltaire also has his <hi rend="italic">lightning</hi> element, and holds of the gods after all.&#x2014; &#x2014; On the whole, it is very clear, if this continue I shall have to go to Germany, especially to Berlin, Rheinsberg, Ruppin<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reinsberg was Frederick&#x2019;s mansion near the little town of Ruppin in Brandenburg; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:406, 14:159ff.</note> and the Riesengebirge: accordingly it seems to be silently settled that we <hi rend="italic">are</hi>, my wife and I, to come across, and stay as long as we can; but the practical particulars of the adventure do not seem to advance much towards maturity all the while. I suppose we shall probably go nevertheless: people preach to me ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the withering heat and sand and then the fierce winter cold of Berlin; but one might try to weather all that, or what was unavoidable of that. I have never yet written to Varnhagen on the subject, tho&#x2019; often thinking of doing so. Indeed I have been much lamed for the last four weeks I <supplied>[had]</supplied> a vile fit of influenza; had two relapses, owing to my impatience; an<supplied>[d]</supplied> made matters worse and worse. The disease was infinitely contemptible; but the <hi rend="italic">weakness</hi> it brought on was something quite transcendent, and it is not yet gone, tho&#x2019; now slowly but steadily going.</p>
<p>People are all busy with their <hi rend="italic">Elections</hi>,&#x2014;that is to say, all people who have any wish or hope to be elected;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the general election in <date when="1852-07-00">July</date>.</note> but the Nation generally, I think, is in a high degree torpid as to such questions; and seems to be gloomily conscious that no good will come to it from electors and eligibles. The late instance of brazen Political Mendacity is slowly producing some surprise and disgust in the English mind, and (I dare say) giving rise to reflexions on the constitutional horoscope which are not of a very flattering nature in this instance!&#x2014; Meanwhile trade is brisk, bread plentiful; and a great stir is rising towards the Australian Gold Fields, and grave anxieties in the Colonial world on that head. I saw yesterday yesterday<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; TC repeats word.</note> a heavy honest Scotchman, owner of twenty <pb id="pg-27-131" n="27:131"/>thousand sheep there, who had been interrupted in his visit home, and was obliged to hurry off again (sailed today), <hi rend="italic">all</hi> his labourers having left him at sheering time except the steward, who, &#x201C;with four blacks,&#x201C; had had to manage as he could. This new gold element is really likely to embroil the general chaos not a little; and may perhaps hurry on either catastrophes or remedies, in various quarters of our affairs.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gold in large nuggets had been discovered in Victoria and New South Wales, <date when="1851-08-00">Aug. 1851</date>, then at Bendigo and elsewhere. Isolated finds had been made since <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, but the govt. discouraged the search for fear of diverting labor from grazing. But, with the new discoveries, workers and adventurers came from all over the world so that the population of Victoria rose rapidly. Huge quantities of gold were reported in <date when="1852-05-00">May</date> as being brought into Melbourne from the largest diggings in Mount Alexander, which raised prices in England.</note> For the rest, we too have at last got summer; whole oceans of verdure; tho&#x2019; as yet mainly under veiled skies, and not with the emphasis that you record of Rhineland. An abundant harvest is said to be in promise; tho&#x2019; perhaps a little later than usual.</p>
<p>I am strongly inclined to be of opinion that you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not quite neglect to look about you over those Estates offered for sale; and see whether you could not tolerably fit yourself with a pleasant rural habitation, where you might learn to farm a little, and trim up once more a home for yourself on the face of this &#x201C;all-nourishing Earth.&#x201C; Depend upon it, as matters go, that is a considerable point for a man; to be anchored even by the possession of a House, a Library, a Dairy, Garden, and good conveniences for <hi rend="italic">living</hi> whatever life one may have,&#x2014;this is greatly preferable to no anchorage at all. As to England, you could still <hi rend="italic">visit</hi> England almost <foreign>ad libitum</foreign>, after a little while; and if you have quite done with trade (as I suppose to be certain), there really is very little in England that cannot be overtaken by visits. I have serious tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> myself, many a time, of fairly lifting anchor out of this empty noise, and steering towards some discoverable habitation that were at least silent, and furnished with not-dirty air to breathe. Age is and should be earnest, sad even, tho&#x2019; not ignobly but nobly sad; and the empty grinning apery of commonplace creatures and their loud inanities ought to be more and more shut out from us as the Eternities draw nigh. You, in your own thoughts, may find occupation for yourself wherever you are; and whether the world takes any notice of it or takes no notice, is really not the question with a man. Besides, cannot you sell your <foreign><hi rend="italic">chateau</hi></foreign> again, if you grow weary of it? At the same time,&#x2014;do nothing rashly! And on the whole never mind my counsels; which, like counsels generally, are given with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> knowledge of the really deciding elements. I can only wish you a <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> decision; and that means <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that can be wished.</p>
<p>Chapman has gained his cause,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On book discounts.</note> so far, with unexpected speed; but the matter is far yet from complete;&#x2014;and on the whole I can prophesy a very <pb id="pg-27-132" n="27:132"/>muddy troubled lake to fish in, for long years henceforth, to the vehement man,&#x2014;with perhaps large draughts of fish now and then, such fish as there is in that kind of water. Of Wilkinson I have heard or seen absolutely nothing since you went. He sent me his <hi rend="italic">Physiology</hi>,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably <hi rend="italic">The Human Body and Its Connexion with Man</hi> (<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>) by James J.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Since you last heard of me, I have been reading and inquiring not a little about Frederick the Great; and have often had it in view to write to you, but <pb id="pg-27-136" n="27:136"/>was always driven back by the vague state of my affairs in that quarter. For all is yet vague; I may say chaotic, pathless,&#x2014;and on the whole, my studies (if they deserve that name) have hitherto served less to afford me direct vision on the subject, than to shew what darkness still envelopes it for me. Books here are pretty abundant upon Frederick, for he has always been an object of interest to the English; but on the whole not the right Books,&#x2014;the right Books, materials and helps are not accessible here, and indeed do not exist here even if one could (which I cannot) sit in the British Museum to read them. On the other hand, importation of Books from Germany, I find, is intolerably tedious and uncertain:&#x2014;in short, I have to admit that my real progress, in proportion to my labour, is quite mournfully small; and after struggling with so many dull reporters, <hi rend="italic">Preuss</hi> (in all forms), <hi rend="italic">Ranke, Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric</hi> (<hi rend="italic">&#x152;uvres de</hi>, in two editions), <hi rend="italic">Voltaire, Lloyd</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Tempelhof</hi> still unattainable), <hi rend="italic">Jomini, Archenholz, Retzow</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >[Friedrich August von Retzow], <hi rend="italic">Characteristik der wichtigsten Ereignisse des siebenj&#xE4;hrigen Krieges, in R&#xfc;cksicht auf Ursachen und Wirkungen</hi>, 2 pts. (Berlin, <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>).</note> not to speak of <hi rend="italic">Zimmermann, Nicolai, Denina</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c, &#x201C;reporters&#x201C; enough,&#x2014;I find the thing reported of still hovering at an immeasurable distance, and only revealing itself to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in fitful enigmatic glimpses, not quite identical with any of the &#x201C;reports&#x201C; I have heard!&#x2014; Add to which, I have no definite <hi rend="italic">literary</hi> object of my own in view, to animate me in those inquiries; nothing but a natural human curiosity, and love of the Heroic, in the absence of other livelier interests from my sphere of work at present: you may figure I have not been a very victorious labourer for the last 7 or 8 months!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I decidedly grow in love for my Hero, as I go on; and can by no means decide to throw him up at this stage of the inquiry. That I should ever write anything on F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> seems more and more unlikely; but perhaps it would be good that my <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> upon him, which has been a kind of intermittent pursuit with me all my life, should now finish and complete itself at last. Accordingly friend Neuberg, I believe, has now another small cargo of Books on the road for me; nay other wider schemes of inquiry are opening: one way or other, I suppose, I ought to play the game out.</p>
<p>From Reymann&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Kreiskarten</hi>, and Stieler&#x2019;s maps, joined to an invaluable old <hi rend="italic">B&#xfc;sching</hi> which has come to me, I get, or can get, fair help towards all manner of <hi rend="italic">topography:</hi> on the other hand, I greatly want some other kind of Book or Books, which should give me with the due <hi rend="italic">minuteness</hi>, &#x26; due <hi rend="italic">indubitability</hi>, a correct basis of <hi rend="italic">Chronology;</hi> in all former inquiries, I had some Contemporary set of Newspapers, <hi rend="italic">Analyse du Moniteur</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An analytical index of the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur Universel</hi>, a newspaper founded <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>, used by TC for <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>.</note> <hi rend="italic">Commons Journals</hi>, private Diary or the like, to serve me in this respect; but here I have yet <pb id="pg-27-137" n="27:137"/>found nothing,&#x2014;and do much want something, the result being always an indispensable one with me, and preliminary to all other results. Had faithful Preuss done the <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres de F</hi>c according to what I think the right plan, all would have been safe in this particular, in the hands of so exact a man: but unfortunately he has looked on F<hi rend="italic">c</hi>&#x2019;s works as <hi rend="italic">Literature</hi> (which they hardly are, or not at all are) and not as <hi rend="italic">Autobiographic Documents</hi> of a World-Hero (which is their real character); and thus, tying up every little ounce-weight of different ware into a bundle of its own,&#x2014;we have a most perverse regularity of <hi rend="italic">method;</hi> the Book, in spite of its painful unrememberable annotations, very often unintelligible to the earnest reader; not to be read in any way except with all the volumes about you at once; and yielding at last a result which is quite bewildering,&#x2014;not a living hero and the shadow of his history, but the <foreign><hi rend="italic">disjecta membra</hi></foreign> [scattered pieces] of him and it. From these <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres</hi>, were they even completed, there will be no Chronology easily attainable.&#x2014; If you know of any such Book as would serve me in this particular, or can hear of any, I will beg you to let me know of it. Also (after all my B&#xfc;schings and Reymanns), I should be very thankful for a little Topographical Dictionary of Prussia, or even of Germany (if not too big): B&#xfc;sching&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Indexes</hi> being hitherto my only help in this respect. Character of place, sequence of time,&#x2014;Topography and Chronology,&#x2014;these are the warp and woof of all historical intelligibility to me.</p>
<p>Another Book which I want still more, if there be such a Book, is some <hi rend="italic">Biographical</hi> Dictionary, or were it even an authentic old &#x201C;Peerage Book&#x201C; such as we have in England,&#x2014;or even a distillation of old Army-Lists and Court Guides,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">some</hi> Prussian Book, I mean, or general German Book, which would tell me a little <hi rend="italic">who</hi> these crowds of empty names <hi rend="italic">are</hi>, at lowest which of them is meant when one hears them mentioned. This is a quite frightful want with me! There are such multitudes of different <hi rend="italic">Schwerins</hi> (&#x201C;of Schwerins,&#x201C; I somewhere heard),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The best-known of whom was Kurt C. von Schwerin (<date when="1684-00-00">1684</date>&#x2013;<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>), field marshal under Frederick II, and of whom Varnhagen wrote a biography (<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>); see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430205-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>16:48</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1843-02-05">5 Dec. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> all of them unknown to me; so many Brandenburg-Schwedl Brunswic-Beverns, half-dozens of Dukes of W&#xfc;rtemburg, &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;it becomes like a <hi rend="italic">Walpurgis-Nacht</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Witches&#x2019; Sabbath, on the eve of <date when="0000-05-01">1 May</date>.</note> unless you can fix some of these into the condition of visual shadows at least!

Of course there are guides better or worse, to an inquiring stranger; and the worst of them, if only authentic and intelligible, would be a kind of treasure to me in this enterprise.</p>
<p>Did you see the <hi rend="italic">Selection from Sir Andrew Mitchell&#x2019;s Correspondence</hi>, two thick volumes, which appeared here some years ago?

I have often pictured to myself the one interview of Vater Fritz and Gabriel Honor&#xE9; on the stage of this world!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But, on the whole, I must now tell you of a project that has risen here of a little Tour to Germany itself on our part; of which the chief justification to me,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">female</hi> mind withal has other views in it,&#x2014;would be to assist myself in these inquiries after Frederick. To look with my eyes upon Potsdam, Ruppin, Rheinsberg, K&#xfc;strin,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Or C&#xfc;strin, a little town in Brandenburg prov., Prussia, now W Poland, where Frederick was imprisoned in a castle, <date when="1730-09-00">Sept.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1730-11-00">Nov. 1730</date>.</note> and the haunts of Frederick; to see the Riesengebirge country and the actual fields of Frederick&#x2019;s 10 or 12 grand battles: this would be a real and great gain to me. Hohenfriedberg, Sohr, Leuthen,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hohenfriedburg, Silesian village, scene of Frederick&#x2019;s victory over Austrians and Saxons, <date when="1745-06-04">4 June 1745</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:119&#x2013;27. Sohr, Silesian village where Frederick defeated the Austrians, <date when="1745-09-30">30 Sept. 1745</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:145&#x2013;58. Leuthen, Silesian village where the Austrians were defeated, <date when="1757-12-05">5 Dec. 1757</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:309&#x2013;25.</note> I could walk these scenes as truly notable ones on this Earth&#x2019;s surface; footsteps of a most brilliant, valiant and invincible human soul which had gone before me thro&#x2019; the centuries, and left indelible trace of himself there. Then at Berlin, one could see at least immensities of <hi rend="italic">Portraits</hi>, Chodowiecki<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel Nikolaus Chodowiecki (<date when="1726-00-00">1726</date>&#x2013;<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>), German artist.</note> Engravings &#x26;c &#x26;c which are quite wanting in this Country; as well as all manner of Books, to be read or to be collected and carried home for reading;&#x2014;not to mention oral inquiries and communications, or the very <hi rend="italic">sight</hi> of friends who might otherwise remain always invisible to me! In short, I think it not unlikely that we may actually come, my Wife and I, this very summer; and try the business a little; for there are Homburg,<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bad Homburg, Prussia, 18 mi. ENE of Wiesbaden, known for its mineral baths.</note> or other watering places in the game too, and we really both of us need a little change of scene, after so many years of this Babel.&#x2014; The drawbacks are, sad incapacity, especially on my part, for sleeping, for digesting, for supporting the conditions of travel,&#x2014;which are sport to most people, and alas are death to poor us!<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400413-TC-HMS-01"><sic>12:107</sic><corr>TC to HMS, <date when="1840-04-13">13 April 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> However, if the motive energy <hi rend="italic">were</hi> sufficiently great? We can both of us speak, or could soon learn to speak, a kind of <foreign>Deutsch-Kauderw&#xE4;lsch</foreign> [German gibberish], which might be intelligible to the quick-eared; and for me, I have a certain readiness in bad French as well. Miss Wynne<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Williams Wynn.</note> eagerly urges the attempt, on hygienic grounds; others urge, and in fact, there is a kind of stir in the matter, which may perhaps come to something.</p>
<p>Will you, at any rate, be so kind as describe to me a little what you reckon the resources of Berlin in regard to my F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> speculations might be,&#x2014;Berlin, I conclude, must be the headquarters in regard to all that;&#x2014;and mention especially <pb id="pg-27-140" n="27:140"/>what the <hi rend="italic">proper time</hi>, both in regard to climate and to the presence of instructive persons, might be for visiting your city. People speak of Berlin heats, and sands, and blazing pavements, and again of Berlin sleets and frosts: a still more important point would be the possibility of lodging in some open-aired and above all, <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> place; doubtless all this is manageable,&#x2014;with a <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> of wisdom, and also with a <hi rend="italic">minimum.</hi> Till your answer come, I will stir no farther.</p>
<p>Miss Wynne, home from Paris this good while, seems as well as ever, and quite beautiful again. <closer><salute>We all salute Varnhagen. Yours always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>A few days ago I received, and have now gone thro&#x2019;, with much interest and pleasure, your Fourth volume;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Thomas Chalmers, D.D., L.L.D.</hi> vol. 4 (<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>).</note> for which, and for all your other kindnesses to me, accept many sincere thanks. This important work is now concluded; and I think we may safely say, is a piece of work well done on your part, and likely to be long useful to mankind. You have written throughout with an admirable candour, clearness, good-nature to all men and yet loyal fidelity to your subject and to truth, which are qualities not easy to combine in writing: on the whole it will be denied by nobody that you have given a conspicuous, minute and faithful likeness, speakingly recogniseable in all its parts, of a remarkable Man and his Life-journey; this does lie in your Book, this which was your grand aim in writing it; and to this, whatever else prove temporary, I can promise a perennial success. It is not often that the world sees men like Thomas Chalmers; nor can the world afford to forget them, or in its most careless mood be willing to do it, when they do appear, in whatever guise that be. Probably the time is coming when it will be more apparent than it now is to every one that <hi rend="italic">here</hi> intrinsically was the chief Scottish man of his Time: a man curiously and perhaps beneficently limited, by his training and position, into narrow <hi rend="italic">St. Andrews</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chalmers had been educated at Edinburgh and St. Andrews Univ. where he was prof. of moral philosophy, <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">28</date>.</note> and exclusively <hi rend="italic">Scottish</hi> fields of action and speculation; but possessed of such a massive geniality of intellect and temper as belonged to no other man. What a grand simplicity, broad humour blent so kindly with enthusiastic ardour and blazing insight; a man of such mild noble valour, strength and piety; above all things, of such a perfect <hi rend="italic">veracity</hi>, I have <pb id="pg-27-141" n="27:141"/>not met with in these times. Honour to him;&#x2014;honour belongs to him; and to the essential <hi rend="italic">work</hi> he did, an everlasting continuance among the possessions of this world! I can safely congratulate you on this duty you have now done; and predict that it is a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">good</hi> investment&#x201C; for all the hard labour you have put into it.</p>
<p>The Sketches of the Free-Kirk Disruption,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430120-TC-MAC-01"><sic>16:28&#x2013;29</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1843-01-20">20 Jan. 1843</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430517-TC-CKJB-01"><sic>169</sic><corr>TC to CKJB, <date when="1843-05-17">17 May 1843</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430714-JWC-TC-01"><sic>275&#x2013;76</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-07-14">14 July 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> in this Last Volume, awaken many sad thoughts in me, new and old: a more obstinately blind misapprehension, by all high heads, of the matter in hand; a baser desertion of poor old Scotland by all her Official sons, was not often witnessed. But we cannot help it: we must take that too, like so much else, in silence,&#x2014;or speak of it, as you do, in a manfully <hi rend="italic">historical</hi> tone.</p>
<p>I find (to descend infinitely) twice or thrice in this volume some mention of my poor self, which cannot be other than very pleasing to me. That last visit to us here, of which there is such a beautifully innocent, clear and <hi rend="italic">true</hi> little picture given, continues venerable and memorable, and cannot cease being so, to my Wife and me. The little glint that breaks out elsewhere, once at Morningside, brought out the best smile that was in me; and for the <hi rend="italic">stars</hi> also (which were perfectly intelligible) I thanked a kind hand!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470220-TC-TCH-01"><sic>21:166</sic><corr>TC to TCH, <date when="1847-02-20">20 Feb. 1847</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470521-TC-MAC-01"><sic>217</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1847-05-21">21 May 1847</date></corr></ref>, and Hanna 4:505 where he gives Chalmers&#x2019;s account of his visit to Cheyne Row (<date when="1847-05-14">14 May 1847</date>), in which he says &#x201C;We stopped more than an hour with him.***.&#x201C;</note> In the Letter, since you have been so good as print it, let me correct one error of the press, more especially since (what is nearly unexampled in these cases) there is but one recogniseable: p. 200, l. 4 &#x201C;naked parts&#x201C; = &#x201C;naked facts&#x201C;; that is all.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hanna 4:198&#x2013;201 had given Chalmers&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1841-09-29">29 Sept. 1841</date> and TC&#x2019;s reply of <date when="1841-10-11">11 Oct. 1841</date> (see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411011-TC-TCH-01"><sic>13:274&#x2013;76</sic><corr>TC to TCH, <date when="1841-10-11">11 Oct. 1841</date></corr></ref>), to which the correction of &#x201C;facts&#x201C; for &#x201C;parts&#x201C; can now be made (13:275 line 5).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Helps,</salute>
<p>Have I not heard you, oftener than once, speak of some House-builder or Carpenter, commonly employed by you in such work, who has the two rare <pb id="pg-27-142" n="27:142"/>properties, fidelity and good sense?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Joseph Morgan.</note>&#x2014; We have a vague speculation here about ex<supplied>[e]</supplied>cuting<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> some considerable repairs on this House, adding a top story to it (inaccessible to <hi rend="italic">sound</hi>, for one thing, and lighted from the sky) &#x26;c &#x26;c, a <hi rend="italic">Lease</hi> of the House being offered us on these conditions. Now if I am right in my remembrance of your man, could you send him to me for a little consultation on the subject. He may find me any evening about 6, while there is still daylight enough. He ought to be warned (and you) that the whole thing is very uncertain hitherto; and that our first immediate want is only of <hi rend="italic">advice</hi> that can be relied on.</p>
<p>I called yesterday at Ebury Street; but you were gone, it was not known for how long. You must by no means absent yourself on Saturday;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the London Lib. meeting; TC is writing on Tues.</note> attend well to that, for I believe the Neapolitan snake has still life in it! Be sure to come.</p>
<p>Officially, I perceive, you have no longer a call to be here,&#x2014;that is to say, typographically. Last night there came gliding in to me, a beautiful second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Conquerors of the New World:</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Conquerors of the New World and Their Bondsmen &#x2026; the Principal Events which led to Negro Slavery</hi>, vol. 2 (<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>); for vol. 1, see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18481206-TC-RWE-01"><sic>23:171</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1848-12-06">6 Dec. 1848</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x201C;Ah,&#x201C; said I to myself, &#x201C;there is the <foreign>corpus <hi rend="italic">delicti!</hi></foreign>&#x201C; I expect a right pleasant evening, going thro&#x2019; this new sin of yours.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>: forget not Saturday; and send the Builder to me if he will come.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I sent a poor little Book to my Mother, out of which you would at least see that we were well, and that your Note had come.</p>
<p>I am kept terribly busy, endeavouring to get a little reading and study accomplished amid such continual interruptions as occur here. Heigho! I <pb id="pg-27-143" n="27:143"/>have great difficulty even in gathering my materials, on this occasion (Books &#x26; Maps about F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> of Prussia), and for the <hi rend="italic">maps</hi> my decay of <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> is a considerable loss. However, let us hold on.</p>
<p>Here at last is a hearty rain; near 40 hours now (for it still continues) of a pretty steady and some times quite heavy rain; which has at <hi rend="italic">length</hi> wetted everything, lea-ground and the rest, to its heart&#x2019;s content. <hi rend="italic">We</hi> have been in want of this, I suppose, for near six months past.</p>
<p>Poor W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Glen, at Carstammon, we learn by a post Note, is dead,&#x2014;died on friday morning last; poor heavy-laden soul. The Note is addressed in his Brother Archy&#x2019;s hand.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Glen, Archy&#x2019;s brother and close friend of TC and John Carlyle, who had lived with Peter Austin of Carstammon since <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>.

TC and John were to show deep and practical concern for him; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331224-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:61&#x2013;62</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-12-24">24 Dec. 1833</date></corr></ref>.

He evidently recovered.</note> we hear no distinct particulars, but the fact is certain, and there appears to be no hope (or fear) of the poor little soul&#x2019;s ever talking in Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> more. Such are the tragedies of the world.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got your Letter; thanks for the good news you still send,&#x2014;thanks also to a Higher than you! Here is another Letter which came this morning from Alick <pb id="pg-27-144" n="27:144"/>and from Jenny&#x2019;s Lasses, which nothing but favourable tidings, and will be welcome to my Mother and the rest of you.</p>
<p>I have been reading all day, Seven-Years war matter, which is very heavy,&#x2014;reading with about 10 <hi rend="italic">maps</hi> moreover, which makes it such a job as you may fancy. Wanting to get thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">maps</hi> at least with daylight, I have altogether belated myself, and must write with far more haste than I anticipated; leaving all other jobs, except a small walk amid the rain, to wait for a <hi rend="italic">better</hi> opportunity. The rain still falls at frequent intervals; warm from the Southwest, the sky <hi rend="italic">always</hi> grey, and seldom the smallest draught in any wind that visits us. We are now thoroughly wetted; and some, I understand, are afraid of injury upon the blossoms of the young wheat.</p>
<p>On Saturday we had a tough business, electing our Librarian. Gladstone, with Bunsen and Lyttelton and Lansdown to back, made due appearance, and had all along been very diligent and eager for his Neapolitan Signor of merit; there were 22 of us in all,&#x2014;11 candidates still left on the List, above 200 had been thrown over as a preliminary:&#x2014;speeches were spoken, manoeuvring went on; finally I advised that we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go to vote, as we &#x201C;were not convincing one another,&#x201C; tho&#x2019; all manner of really politeness, candour and delicate manage<hi rend="italic">t</hi> was going on: Presid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Lord Devon, an accomplished old stager, took the written votes;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Courtenay (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), 10th earl of Devon.</note> counted them out amid considerable stillness: &#x201C;For Donne 18, for Lakaita (the Signor of merit) 4&#x201C;;&#x2014;after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> we departed, most of us, with mutual congratulations. A vote was adopted too of general esteem for Jones, and recognition of our obligation to do something for him in the way of permanent promotion, were Donne once on the ground. Donne a friend of Spedding, Milnes &#x26;c, a scholar of distinction, capital &#x201C;man of business&#x201C; (they say), and small Norfolk Squire who&#x2014;even the J.P.s love him,&#x2014;appears to be, if <hi rend="italic">testimony</hi> can be credited, little short of an &#x201C;Admirable Crichton,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Crichton (<date when="1560-00-00">1560</date>&#x2013;<date when="1585-00-00">85</date>), scholar, his title of &#x201C;Admirable&#x201C; came from Sir Thomas Urquhart&#x2019;s account of his career (<date when="1652-00-00">1652</date>).</note> fit to be the envy of surrounding Libraries; but we shall see better what stuff is really in him, when once he takes his work in hand!&#x2014; Thinking you might like to hear what the issue was, I snatched a bit of paper, and had actually scribbled you a couple of half-legible lines,&#x2014;for my hand was quite <hi rend="italic">shaking</hi>, and I was all thrown into flurry by the bother I had had (&#x201C;speaking&#x201C; too, tho&#x2019; with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the aid of parliamentary eloquence):&#x2014;I was still in time for the Post; but in the confusion of the place, before I could find a cover and wax, I had actually <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> my tiny scribble, and couldn&#x2019;t find it again at all! There it still lies, or rather has gone to the fire and final rest. Happily nobody could well read it, or even think of reading it, and it was signed only &#x201C;T. C.&#x201C;&#x2014; <pb id="pg-27-145" n="27:145"/>I meant to ask Jones today ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> your Book-parcel, but cannot now till tomorrow.&#x2014; Forster is lying terribly ill, of universal rheumatism, these 3 weeks and more; now a little recovering. John Chorley has had the <hi rend="italic">measles!</hi> Take care of my good old Mother,&#x2014;I see you do. <closer><salute>My love and regards to all. Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It is saturday, and I must not let the week close with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> writing half a word to assure my good Mother and the rest of you that we are well. Nothing else is ready for saying. I have, for the rest, a real <hi rend="italic">hatred</hi> of writing, at present, and studiously avoid it all I can.</p>
<p>You got Jones&#x2019;s Books, I hope?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Edward Jones.</note> There was a considerable parcel taken up from here, while it was still in time; and the whole were to go off &#x201C;that same night&#x201C; (Wednesday, I think). You can send the <hi rend="italic">Charles V.</hi> to Dumfries when there is opportunity, if nobody want to read it at Scotsbrig. I fear my Mother will not be able to stand it? I have not yet announced it at Dumfries; so of course they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in hurry for it. The last Vol. of <hi rend="italic">Chalmers</hi> will stand a good deal of reading! I had a very kind Note from Hanna in answer to some word of thanks I wrote for it. <hi rend="italic">Marg</hi>t <hi rend="italic">Fuller</hi> will perhaps amuse you here and there, tho&#x2019; it is dreadfully longwinded and indistinct,&#x2014;as if one were telling the story not in words, but in <hi rend="italic">symbolical</hi> tunes on the bagpipe!&#x2014;&#x2014; We got <hi rend="italic">Jeffrey&#x2019;s Life</hi> too,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Thomas, Lord Cockburn, <hi rend="italic">Life of Lord Jeffrey. With a Selection from his Correspondence</hi>, 2 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>). TC&#x2019;s copy, acquired later, with his marginal notes, is in the Houghton Lib., Harvard.</note> which is readable (and little more) but somebody has it out on loan this while, and we wait for another opportunity.</p>
<p>Our weather is still very showery, but to me not disagreeable; the temperature is gentle, and there are hours of the brightest blue. My influenza is quite gone; I even in some respects feel a little better, and <hi rend="italic">clearer</hi> for the disorder I had. Within these few days I have taken to a &#x201C;compress&#x201C; (girdle of <hi rend="italic">wet-towel!</hi>) which seems to produce more effect on me than any other of the water-cure regulations. We shall see whether it continues. The water-cure affair is fairly equal to <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> for me as yet.</p>
<p>I have seen Donne, our new Librarian, once; a grave-eyed, grey, gentlemanlike <pb id="pg-27-146" n="27:146"/>little man of 45, very civil, very intellig<hi rend="italic">t</hi> (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> in the transcend<hi rend="italic">t</hi> degree), and to all appearance a very honest, diligent and respectable kind of man.</p>
<p>Last night, at the Ashburtons&#x2019;, I saw the (expelled) Duke of Holstein-Augustenburg, a mournful tall lean princely man, <hi rend="italic">son</hi> of him who gave Schiller the pension: he has come over here to look after his shattered affairs (I suppose),&#x2014;some &#xa3;12,000 a year has been appointed him (by Downing Street) in lieu of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> claims and possessions, with banish<hi rend="italic">t</hi> from Holstein superadded; and they don&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> him the &#xa3;12,000, it appears, or make any main <supplied>[intention]</supplied> of doing it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Schleswig-Holstein question had been disputed between Denmark and Prussia and other German states since <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>. In spite of an armistice when Prussian and Danish troops were withdrawn from the duchies and a separate constitution granted to Schleswig, the war between the Germans and the Danes resumed and, after long-drawn negotiations, led to peace, <date when="1850-07-02">2 July 1850</date>, when both sides reserved their rights. This led to the London Protocol, <date when="1852-05-08">8 May 1852</date>, signed by Britain, Russia, France, Austria, Prussia, Sweden, and Denmark, guaranteeing the inseparability of the duchies, and their union with Denmark, and fixing the succession. The claims of Christian, duke of Augustenburg, were settled by a payment.</note> We had to speak French, or I should have got some real good of his talk, which is much more rational and serious than that of English persons of rank (or not of rank) in gen<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> We have a speculation here about taking a big lease of this House, and building a new <hi rend="italic">Story</hi> on the top of it,&#x2014;by way of getting a matchless study-room there, lighted from the roof, and perfectly <hi rend="italic">free</hi> of noise and some other nuisances! There is some considerable likelihood of getting this fairly set about;&#x2014;but I will tell you more upon it when there is more time.</p>
<p>John Chorley has come in, and waits; Miss Wynn <hi rend="italic">has</hi> come in, and called me down, and is now gone. Alas, Jane is out, not mounting guard over the second story; and this &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">wooden</hi> guardian of my privacy&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>Tell me again about my Mother; still more minute description of her ways and general state, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be welcome.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There has no message arrived here this long time which struck upon us with a more impressive, sad and altogether tragic and affectionate feeling, than the poor little black-edged Note we received from Carstammon when the <foreign><hi rend="italic">finis</hi></foreign> had taken place there! Poor William, the strong soul involved for so many years in black baleful clouds, has at length got his <hi rend="italic">release:</hi> in this earnest fact, what a multitude of strange reflexions for those who had known him well and loved him! This world, we often hear, is a mystery throughout; and surely the aspect of such a Sampson spirit, blinded, and yet to stumble darkly grinding in the mill,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Judges 16:21 and Milton, <hi rend="italic">Samson Agonistes</hi> 41.</note> is of a kind to give us pause in our pretensions to understand the ways of Omniscience and Omnipotence. I have seen in my time few more <hi rend="italic">un</hi>speakable sights, fitter for pious silence instead of speech, than the Life of him who is now gone from us.</p>
<p>We have the satisfaction of thinking that his sufferings were by no means excessive or unendurable in his dark state; indeed, so far as I remarked, his personal &#x201C;happiness&#x201C; (if such a term can be used) was fully superior, his burden on the whole <hi rend="italic">lighter</hi>, than when he used to be with me in London long ago. He enjoyed free air, quiet hillsides, and had his own strange phantasmagory of thoughts amid the solitary moors. The Austins, I do believe, were honestly kind and respectful to him always, and both out of conscience and attachment (not to speak of meaner motives, which to them were important also) strove to do a real duty to him;&#x2014;and surely, in all his wanderings and confused meditatings, there attended him one blessed feeling, that he had a Brother,&#x2014;warm as life-blood to him, true as steel; who had never failed <pb id="pg-27-148" n="27:148"/>him, and would never fail! I remember still, with a pleasant and kind emotion, how he used to speak of &#x201C;Archy,&#x201C; with what honest pride, and love, to which gratitude rather added wings than burden:&#x2014;the good soul, he had a generous heart; and his great intellect, tho&#x2019; all shattered to ruin, was still there, strangely illuminated by Hope and Love, hardly visited by Rage or Hatred of any kind even for moments. One thinks of him now as of a glorious <hi rend="italic">child</hi> that is dead; whom the fates forbade to fulfil our hopes, but who has left us no regrets except kind and blessed ones. To you, who have your natural sorrows, and peculiar reminiscences of good and evil, awakened into sad vitality by this event, let the consolations also which are peculiar be present&#x2014;among the chief of which, I think, there may well stand the way in which <hi rend="italic">your</hi> duty was continually done, and continually recognized to be done.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Sir. We shall ever wish you well in this house, for our poor William&#x2019;s sake, and for your own; and hope as heretofore, to hear good news of you, from time to time, in this world&#x2014;God bless you.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I believe I am shamefully in your debt, this good while; I decide to throw you off a word today <hi rend="italic">before</hi> beginning to anything else: that is the only sure plan. With bad paper, bad pens,&#x2014;and what is more, a perpetual every changing <hi rend="italic">variety</hi> of bad;&#x2014;with the continual whirl of botheration that goes on here from perfectly extraneous intrusive persons; with my own poor daily work, getting always the more obstructed, the weaker <hi rend="italic">I</hi> get for doing it: with all these things acting on me, my aversion to write letters, or to write at all, has become very considerable; and goes on increasing I think! Nevertheless, as old Francis Bell said to his wife<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both Bells unidentified.</note> in the <hi rend="italic">dear years</hi>, &#x201C;Tibbie, my woman, if I were going to keep <hi rend="italic">any body</hi>, with the meal at such a rate, I would keep <hi rend="italic">thee</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; And so it shall be till the &#x201C;meal&#x201C; rise even a good deal dearer!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I sent, the other day, thro&#x2019; Scotsbrig in the Doctor&#x2019;s Parcel, a small gift to James: <hi rend="italic">Robertson&#x2019;s History of Charles V.;</hi> which you too, if you are still short of reading material, may at once embark upon. It gives account of Luther&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reformation</hi> (in its own way), and of many other things; in a style that gave universal satisfaction 70 years ago, and makes it still one of the celebrated Books of the world. I can advise the reading of it still; tho&#x2019; as to the &#x201C;celebrating,&#x201C; if one were to go strictly to work, there were two words to that bargain. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> do not understand maps, you say? I hope James does; and will get himself some extremely cheap map of Germany, and keep looking occasionally into it as he reads. The worst of maps is better than none; if he can get hold of nothing (no School-Atlas map, or the like), tell me, and I will tear out some old rag for him, or try otherwise what is to be done.</p>
<p>I keep reading here innumerable Books about Frederick; making almost no way in the real study of him. I am fully as well in health as usual; rather <hi rend="italic">better</hi> indeed, ever since the influenza, but a little more afraid of <hi rend="italic">damp</hi> or draughts of air. We have had perpetually recurring showers, and nothing but veiled cool skies (tho&#x2019; with a fine genial warmth in the winds) for six weeks back; till now we are thoroughly soaked, after the iron drought; and desirous of sun and drought,&#x2014;which also appears to have <hi rend="italic">come</hi>, since the thunder of Saturday last. Nothing suits <hi rend="italic">me</hi> so well as a rainy summer here: an hour&#x2019;s rain per day, and London gives the nicest summer weather I have ever lived in. In the country at present, all is one ocean of luxuriant green; and our <hi rend="italic">western</hi> breezes here in Chelsea ought to be almost as fresh as yours at Dumfries, for <pb id="pg-27-150" n="27:150"/>there is only a thin straggling group of streets between us and the country in that quarter,&#x2014;after which is the Atlantic Ocean and America merely.</p>
<p>Our German speculation is not quite dead yet; but a letter I had from Berlin gives it a considerable blow: <foreign>viz.</foreign> that <hi rend="italic">Berlin</hi> (where I chiefly wanted to be) is visible to perfection only in winter and spring: till the &#x201C;end of <date when="1852-09-00">Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>,&#x201C; not even &#x201C;professors&#x201C; are there, nor any soul whom I should care to see,&#x2014;all fled to <hi rend="italic">Moffat-well</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To spas, as at Moffat, Dumfriesshire.</note> on account of the heats. On the other hand, there are invitations at this fine season, in regard to the country parts. How it will be I do not well discern hitherto.&#x2014; What concerns us more, is a much closer speculation about taking a long lease of this House, and executing, now without delay, some thorough repairs upon it. Alas, I begin to see that I shall <hi rend="italic">never</hi> &#x201C;get into the country again&#x201C; to live! I must resign myself to do the best I can here; and see, if I can, to get a little more work out of myself before I die. &#x201C;Free is the <hi rend="italic">heart</hi>,&#x201C; says Goethe, &#x201C;but the <hi rend="italic">foot</hi> is bound&#x201C;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270415-TC-G-01"><sic>4:210&#x2013;11</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1827-04-15">15 April 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> ah, me! Well, we have had builders consulting &#x26;c, and I think there really will something be done,&#x2014;be begun straightway. Jane will superintend; I (especially if heat come) will fly. That is all the definite news at present. <closer><salute>God bless you, dear Sister.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am glad to hear your Parcel has at last arrived; I suspect those delays must be inevitable by the cheap train, at least they always occur in this direction too. It appears you did not get the <hi rend="italic">Marg</hi>t <hi rend="italic">Fuller</hi>, after all, but only the <hi rend="italic">Leigh Hunt</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly <hi rend="italic">The Autobiography of Leigh Hunt</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), or <hi rend="italic">Table Talk</hi> (<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>).</note> which was bound in a similar fashion! I will take care of the other for you by some early opportunity. Some considerable bother has been here about certain <hi rend="italic">Mss.</hi> which Miss Fuller had left in charge with a Miss Gillies, and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Emerson and the Mother Fuller were anxious to regain. I have happily got thro&#x2019; that for them; and am this day to give the Packet itself into John Chapman&#x2019;s hands for despatch by the Steamer: so <hi rend="italic">that</hi> ends. I had a very kind Letter from Emerson<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1852-06-02">2 June</date>.</note> this week, chiefly about that; I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> send it today (instead of next time) except for the <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> of other enclosures. By the bye, as to that of <hi rend="italic">Books</hi> by post, it is still a dubious point with me whether such a <pb id="pg-27-151" n="27:151"/>&#x201C;Letter&#x201C; as the one inclosed last time, was within the law or without. You can stick in any &#x201C;papers&#x201C; unsealed; only no <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> (which that, properly, was <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, any longer?)&#x2014;in short, I suppose, you must not <hi rend="italic">defraud</hi> the Post-Office. It is a doubtful case!</p>
<p>Varnhagen&#x2019;s and Neuberg&#x2019;s Letters you may return when convenient: N.&#x2019;s Book-parcel, by Bunsen&#x2019;s Courier from Aachen, has not yet been heard of; but will probably come, after &#x201C;the 1st ins<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,&#x201C; when another Courier is due. I have great store of Books for present reading on that subject; and they cost little, if one could only get them carried.&#x2014; &#x2014; Today we have had the House Agent (a dirty little Cockney, just gone); and are to have a lease of 31 years; after which, forward with the <hi rend="italic">improvements!</hi> The top story (I think, the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> one) must <foreign><hi rend="italic">unterbleiben</hi></foreign> [be omitted] for this year; there is such abundance to do in the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> parts. And the sooner we <hi rend="italic">begin</hi>, of course the sooner we shall end. What our movements are to be, in the middle of such complicacies (for Jane ought to be <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, while the repairs go on), and whether we try for Germany or not, is still uncertain. Naturally I think of Annandale too, and my dear old Mother there, whom with the rest of you I naturally want to see! Hitherto the weather is delightful here, but by and by it will be too hot.&#x2014; Is poor Isabella grown better? And my brave old Mother,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">eheu</hi></foreign>, but I have neither time nor room left,&#x2014;<closer><salute>Ever yours</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name></p>
<ps><p>I have to leave out <hi rend="italic">Varnhagen</hi>, as over weight. <foreign>Nichts</foreign> [of no consequence]!&#x2014;</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your magnanimous Letters came;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1852-05-14">14 May</date> and <date when="1852-06-02">2 June</date>.</note> I forwarded Mrs Fuller&#x2019;s, and your smaller ostensible one, without delay; Miss Gillies&#x2019;s answer came before very long, <hi rend="italic">accepting</hi> her Hobson&#x2019;s choice; and now so soon as this Note is thrown off, I send off with it, and with the Parcel itself, to John Chapman&#x2019;s whom I have appointed to be in readiness; and so, enclosing his <hi rend="italic">receipt</hi> for you here by post, and delivering the <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi> to their place in his big general Hamper, I hope the same Steamer will prosperously convey both messages, and so this little business will be well finished. I have had <hi rend="italic">no</hi> farther trouble with it; and indeed never had any that was worth speaking a word upon,&#x2014;much less so many kind words as you are misled into speaking, and attaching meaning to! You are a born <hi rend="italic">enthusiast</hi>, as quiet as you are; and it will continue so, at intervals, to the end. I admire your sly low-voiced sarcasm too;&#x2014;in short, I love the sternly-gentle close-buttoned man very well, as I have always done, <pb id="pg-27-152" n="27:152"/>and intend to continue doing!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1852-06-02">2 June</date>: &#x201C;You are the best &#x26; most beneficent of the immortal mortals. It could not be credited. I must have all, &#x26; with a history of the pelican Carlyle that taps his veins to feed the poor. Blessings on the wise head! May it never ache again! Blessings on the great heart&#x2014;oft belied&#x2014;that can divert all its tide to the first beggar. But I never dreamed of inflicting such tasks on you, much-enduring pains-inviting man! I fancied it only needed you should give a pure direction to Mrs Fuller&#x2019;s billet, &, of course, I was willing such direction should be an autograph that would add wings to its flight anywhere on British ground,&#x2014;&#x2018;written with the vermilion pencil&#x2019;; but I did not mean to betray you into a negociation. I did not once think of the official Mr <supplied>[Richard]</supplied> Bentley [London publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>], to whom, of course, I ought to have written. And unluckily our publishers <hi rend="italic">did</hi>, and were putting up Richard Fuller [Margaret&#x2019;s brother], in an evil hour, to write, through Mr Bentley, a &#x2018;professional&#x2019; letter to the lady,&#x2014;sure to wound,&#x2014;and she so good &#x26; loyal, as you have rightly described her. I hate,&#x2014;that Margaret should, through her representatives or shadows, chide &#x26; agitate now that her bones lie tranquilly under the sea. But though I grieve to have it laid on you, yet I can hardly regret that this costly service, in her own very spirit, should be paid to her.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; Pray observe, therefore, and lay it to heart as a practical fact, that you are bound to persevere in writing to me from time to time; and will never get it given up, how sulky soever you grow, while we both remain in this world. Do not I very well understand all that you say about &#x201C;apathized moods&#x201C; &#x26;c?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1852-06-02">2 June</date>: &#x201C;You make me happy with your loving thoughts &#x26; meanings towards me. I have always thanked the good star which made us early neighbors, in some sort, in time &#x26; space. And the beam is twice warmed by your vigorous goodwill, which has steadily kept clear kind eyes on me. &#x2026; O yes, and I feel all the solemnity &#x26; vital cheer of the benefit. If only the mountains of water &#x26; of land, &#x26; the steeper mountains of blighted &#x26; apathised moods, would permit a word to pass, now &#x26; then!&#x201C;</note> The gloom of approaching old age (approaching, nay arriving with some of us) is very considerable upon a man; and on the whole, one contrives to take the very ugliest view, now and then, of all beautifullest things; and to shut one&#x2019;s lips with a kind of grim defiance, a kind of imperial sorrow which is almost like felicity,&#x2014;so completely and composedly wretched, one is equal to the very gods! Those too are necessary moods to a man. But the Earth withal is verdant, sun-beshone; and the Son of Adam has his place on it, and his tasks and recompenses in it, to the close;&#x2014;as one remembers by and by, too. On the whole, I am infinitely solitary; but not more heavy-laden than I have all along been, perhaps rather less so; I could fancy even old age to be beautiful, and to have a real divineness: for the rest, I say always, I cannot part with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, however it go; and so, in brief, you must get into the way of holding yourself obliged as formerly to a kind of <hi rend="italic">dialogue</hi> with me; and speak, on paper since not otherwise, the oftenest you can. Let that be a point settled.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1852-06-02">2 June</date>: &#x201C;It is not your fault that you do a hero&#x2019;s work in unheroic times, nor do we love you less, if we cannot help you in it. Pity me, O strong man! I am of a puny constitution, half made up, &, as I from childhood knew, not a poet, but a lover of poetry &#x26; poets, &#x26; merely serving as writer, &#x26;c, in this empty America, before &#x26; pending the arrival of the Poets. You must not misconstrue my silences, but thank me for them all, as a true homage to your diligence, which I love to guard. Yet I cannot resist your appeals, &, if you wish letters, you shall have them, though I have little to tell.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-153" n="27:153"/>I am not <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> on Frederic the Great; nor at all practically contemplating to do so. But, being in a reading mood after those furious <hi rend="italic">Pamphlets</hi> (which have procured me showers of abuse from all the extensive genus stupid in this country, and not done me any other mischief, but perhaps good), and not being capable of reading except in a train and <hi rend="italic">about</hi> some object of interest to me,&#x2014;I took to reading, near a year ago, about Frederick, as I had twice in my life done before; and have, in a loose way, tumbled up an immense quantity of shot rubbish on that field, and still continue. Not with much decisive approach to Frederick&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">self</hi>, I am still afraid! The man looks brilliant and noble to me; but how <hi rend="italic">love</hi> him, or the sad wreck he lived and worked in? I do not even yet <hi rend="italic">see</hi> him clearly; and to try making others see him&#x2014;?&#x2014; Yet Voltaire and he <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the celestial element of the poor 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi> century; poor souls. I confess also to a real love for F.&#x2019;s dumb followers: The Prussian <hi rend="italic">Soldiery</hi>&#x2014;I often say to myself, &#x201C;Were not <hi rend="italic">here</hi> the real priests and virtuous martyrs of that loud-babbling rotten generation!&#x201C; And so it goes on; where to end, or in what to end, God knows.</p>

<p>It is about a fortnight since your Letter came; but I delayed answering till the arrival of the Books could be announced, which latter event did not take place till last night.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote from Bonn, <date when="1852-06-17">17 June</date>, that he was sending a parcel of books &#x201C;to <hi rend="italic">Aachen</hi> with covering addressed to the Chevalier Bunsen, and inner covering addressed to Chelsea.&#x201C;</note> You were in good time for Aachen of the <date when="1852-06-17">17<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>, it appears, but the Courier was already heavy-laden, so von der Hosen<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The postal agent in Aachen.</note> put us off till the following 1st day of the month. No damage done, except the little disappointmen<supplied>[t,]</supplied> none at all. Everything was delivered here in perfect order, your seal signature and pack thread still in their places; a most welcome cheap cargo of Books, which will be very useful to me, and ought to teach me thankfulness to you for many a day to come. They are truly interesting Books, so far as the titles can indicate; <hi rend="italic">B&#xfc;sching</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Nikolai Anekdoten</hi> I am especially glad of; old H&#xfc;bner too will teach me a great many things: it is astonishing what one may learn from consorting with authentic well-instructed persons, whatever subject they may be handling; a pity indeed, that all <hi rend="italic">other</hi> kinds of persons could not be quite extinguished from the Writing Guild, when their presence is as that of vile hemlocks in a garden-bed, and no better, as numerous as it fatally is in these times! Thanks for the <hi rend="italic">Battle of Molwitz</hi> too, and the <hi rend="italic">Second Silesian War</hi> with its plans &#x26;c,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Fuchs, the local schoolmaster, <hi rend="italic">Jubelschrift zur feier der schlacht bei Mollwitz, den <date when="1841-04-10">10 April 1841</date></hi> (Brieg, [<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>]); see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 15:116, though the Houghton copy is dated <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date> by TC.

The <hi rend="italic">Kartoffelkrieg</hi> (Potato War) was the War of Bavarian Succession (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:189&#x2013;222) and is, as Neuberg noted in the list of books he was sending, the subject of F. W. K. Graf von Schmettau, <hi rend="italic">&#xdc;ber den Feldzug der Preussischen Armee in B&#xF6;hmen im Jahre <date when="1778-00-00">1778</date></hi> (Berlin, <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>).</note> I am well furnished on that side.

I have had one Gr&#xE4;gers Catalogue (Graeger of <hi rend="italic">Halle</hi>), and have marked various Books in it; some of which I may by and by consult you upon,&#x2014;if I do not come myself to look after that and other things!&#x2014; One of our last new Library importations (along with <hi rend="italic">Tempelhof</hi>&#x2018;) was the <hi rend="italic">Hildebrandt</hi> Anekdoten,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Anekdoten und Charakterz&#xfc;ge aus dem Leben Friedrich des Zweiten</hi>, 2nd edn.

Hildebrandt seems to be some <hi rend="italic">Writer</hi> on Frederic,&#x2014;possibly still alive;&#x2014;his own authority is good for nothing, of course, his very knowledge and natural judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> (I perceive) being good for very little.&#x2014; Does anybody about you know what became of the old Frederic <hi rend="italic">Hat</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Gleim begged and took to Halberstadt with him!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim (<date when="1719-00-00">1719</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>), poet and canon of Halberstadt; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:303.</note> It explains an allusion in Jean Paul which I never understood before.&#x2014; But we must draw bridle.</p>
<p>The edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> is out again;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning that the 3rd (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>) edn. was exhausted; to be replaced by a 4th in <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>. Neuberg wrote to Varnhagen from Bonn, <date when="1852-06-25">25 June</date>, that he had been translating TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi>, and that TC told him that important changes had been made in the lecture on Cromwell in the 3rd edn. which should be taken into account. &#x201C;My translation, however, is based on the first edition, the only one I possess and had available and I have no idea how to get hold of the third edition short of having it sent expressly from England, unless it so happens that you own it and were willing to lend me your copy for a short time &#x2026; . needless to say I shall handle it with great care&#x201C; (MS: Jagiellonian Lib., Krakow, trans.).</note> a &#x201C;copy&#x201C; not to be procured with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> difficulty; I have therefore copied the small totality of changes to be made; and have send<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> it to you,&#x2014;unluckily on most infirm thin paper; which will task your poor eyes and patience as you read it. If there is anything absolutely invincible, send me the phrase again (with the approximate page), and I will help you. I have introduced, for this fourth edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, the corrections you suggested, and all is ready on my part, but the Bookseller (in this downbreak of the old modes of <pb id="pg-27-156" n="27:156"/>trade) seems to pause in a kind of amaze<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, uncertain rather <hi rend="italic">how</hi> to shape himself,&#x2014;forecasting in the distance what he calls &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">general cheap</hi> edition.&#x201C; Besides we are all electing and getting elected,&#x2014;the most utterly stagnant elections-humour I have ever seen;&#x2014;and the Quality are all fairly gone, a month before their time; and Books are not the thing wanted at present.</p>
<p>Varnhagen&#x2019;s Letter about the conditions and capabilities of Berlin checked all speculations in that direction for the present and next month: indeed when I look practically into Berlin, it is not as a joy but as a necessity that I can much contemplate a visit thither, Aesthetic Teas in Germany<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As given by the Countess Z&#xE4;hdarm, see Harrold <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 124, 133 ff. Neuberg also wrote to Varnhagen &#x201C;You will know that Carlyle is up to his ears in reading and studying all about Frederick the Great. It is droll and admirable with what voraciousness he devours everything relating to the subject, and with what powers of digestion he assimilates the contents. He is also talking about a visit to Germany in the near future, an extended stay even, for the same purpose, and it is likely that presently you will have to give all sorts of information regarding Berlin&#x2019;s summer heat and winter cold.&#x201C;</note> are not likely to be much lovelier to me than the like phenomena in England&#x2014;<foreign>ach Gott</foreign>! Cultivated men of the &#x201C;silent&#x201C; (practical) sort whom I might hope to meet with there, would be far more instructive and far more welcome to me. At all events the <hi rend="italic">Localities</hi> are what I must see (if I persist in Frederic): the Berlin ones more essentially than any,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I think the Battlefields, added to the Riesengeberg and the country of Ziska<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ziska (or Zizka), Johann (<date when="1360-00-00">1360</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1424-00-00">1424</date>), Bohemian gen. and Hussite leader; see <hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 12:147&#x2013;48.</note> &#x26; R&#xfc;bezahl, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be still more interesting as a sight.&#x2014; Beyond question your offer is very seductive! And I can clearly answer that we are meditating hard on it, my wife and I, and have a real desire towards it, nay at times almost an enthusiasm,&#x2014;tho&#x2019;, alas, we dare answer nothing positive, for at least a month to come. We have masons and carpenters, namely, in the House here, a &#x201C;thorough repair&#x201C; going on, which cannot be trusted to itself,&#x2014;not till the painting come, will the critical eye (especially the female one) consent to withdraw itself. Let us wait in hope, and see how that and other conditions will take shape! <hi rend="italic">You</hi>, if you have other projects you<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> in the interim, we must not bind to wait on this chance; but if you were still waiting, certainly it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a real temptation.&#x2014; Meanwhile, here is, since the last 3 days, a blaze of insupportable hot weather; only one prayer and outlook for the sons of Adam, &#x201C;Rain, Thunder, Rain!&#x201C;&#x2014;this morning I awoke at 4, and have now had a long day of it (in my dressing closet upstairs) with the masons raging below!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

I never saw the lady in my life&#x2014; I never spoke to her in my life.&#x2014; I never heard of or from her in my life&#x2014; I never wrote to her in my life.&#x2014; Every thing that you state to the contrary is untrue&#x2014; I have now Madam to accuse you of a very serious charge, which is no less than that for some time past I believe you to have been fully aware of the <hi rend="italic">untruth</hi> of your statements, but have nevertheless persisted in repeating them, and I do accuse you accordingly.&#x2014; More than this I also believe in my heart that you <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> the individual who has assumed my name, and to screen that individual you have endeavoured to mystify our mutual friends by these tales.&#x2014; When my Sol<hi rend="italic">r</hi> waited upon you last Monday you could only give him the most evasive replies, and seeing that he was near &#x26; I a long way <hi rend="italic">of<supplied>[f]</supplied></hi> you said that you could only prove your statements to me personally, and you sullied your lips with language most unfit for a lady or indeed any woman&#x2014; I have nevertheless left my home and &#x2026; presented myself at your house yesterday&#x2014;I have asked you to go with me to M<hi rend="italic">rs.</hi> Carlyle and repeat your strange tale before me This you agreed to do, and your husband gave you permission to go&#x2014; You then would not go without him well knowing that he is forbidden M<hi rend="italic">rs.</hi> Carlyles house and that I could not take him there.&#x2014; You talked of letters you have received but cannot produce; of people of whose whereabouts you knew nothing, of conversations of which you have forgotten the material points, of having seen letters in my hand writing which you cannot obtain &#x2026; . Your husband assisted you by endeavouring in the most libellous manner (when I suggested that some one had assumed my name) to fix the charge on <hi rend="italic">some other</hi> of his <hi rend="italic">Manchester friends.</hi>&#x2014; Finally when you reluctantly started with me to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle, your husband also with us he got out of the Cab saying he would not go, you followed him saying you would not go without him, neither of you in reality daring to go, and in the Public Streets he seeks to quarrel, pushing you violently towards me saying &#x2018;Take her, take her,<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied> to give bystanders and passers by some erroneous impression and acted and spoke more like a drunken idiot than a rational man&#x2014; I must not omit that before he gave you permission to go, he threatened that if you did go you must not come back again to his house.&#x2014; My last feelings for you both were profound sorrow, and I no longer bear any anger against either of you&#x2014; In this matter I no longer recognise the M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Nodes Newton of old. / F.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We are in a furious uproar here, nothing but bricklayers, dust and tumult over all the house; a &#x201C;thorough repair&#x201C; going actually on! I am banished up to my little dressing-closet here, behind the bedroom; here stands my desk, with a few books; the <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> are all now mere <hi rend="italic">stacks</hi> of books, or pinned in their shelves with curtains, to keep off the unspeakable dust: it is truly a <hi rend="italic">hot</hi> case we are in. For, besides there has come a blazing heat (physically speaking too) within these four days, very horrible for human creatures among bricks; and if thunder and rain don&#x2019;t come soon, it will be bad times with us, I perceive. Meanwhile it is not quite so unendurable as I expected; I have off all the carpets here; I keep a wateringpot beside me, and fearlessly moisten both floors and walls; so that with windows down, and plenty of wind blowing, and almost no clothes at all, I contrive to get along. Want of sleep is the worst; but it raises us at a far thriftier hour, and makes a nice long day, for one thing,&#x2014;so is not without its advantages too.</p>
<p>The chief &#x201C;repairs&#x201C; contemplated are an enlargement of the library,&#x2014;conversion of the library into a kind of Drawingroom, according to the modern ideas. They are taking back the fireplace (<hi rend="italic">two feet</hi> of that great tower of brickwork are gone out of the way); new proper windows with a great increase of light; lastly three feet additional width to be taken off Jane&#x2019;s bedroom,&#x2014;Jane will shift to the top front room, which used to be yours, which, with this of mine, she has undertaken to make &#x201C;very handsome.&#x201C; We are also to get water into the house &#x26;c &#x26;c. There will remain always behind the drawingroom, a <hi rend="italic">guest&#x2019;s bedroom</hi>, tho&#x2019; contracted in size,&#x2014;where we hope to <pb id="pg-27-159" n="27:159"/>see you one day, our first guest in it if we are in luck!&#x2014; I sincerely hope this may be the last job of the kind I may ever be concerned in. But after mature survey of our affairs, there did not seem to be any practicable shift so good as that of settling ourselves where we are: ah, me! And so we are going at this enterprise with due energy, so far as <hi rend="italic">this</hi> will serve us. A man, I know, is independent of his lodging; but it grieves me much to think I have no prospect now, or at least less than ever, of getting back to live among quiet fields: I must take my lodging <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and see what fraction of work I can still wring out of my existence; there is nothing else in it that is, or indeed was, or is ever like to be, worth a stiver to me. We have got a &#x201C;Lease of 31 years,&#x201C; and fair basis for changing the house into our own image as nearly as it will come: so <foreign><hi rend="italic">En avant!</hi></foreign> The place too is very cheap;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to A. Carlyle, the rent was &#xa3;35 a year.</note> and on the present terms (whatever become of <hi rend="italic">us</hi>) an outlay of &#xa3;200 or &#xa3;250 is considered a perfectly safe investment. The man (a very good kind of man, Helps&#x2019;s and Chorley&#x2019;s) undertakes to have done in about six weeks&#x2014;(Hoohoo! my time is totally <hi rend="italic">up</hi>, dear Brother; here has Jane come in with the alarm; and I must put you off till night! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>)&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Same Ev</hi>g, <hi rend="italic">7 p.m.</hi>&#x2014; We went to Twistleton&#x2019;s by appoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, to see some Puritan Portraits; especially two portraits, one of Oliver by Walker (genuine, but of no great worth), another, or rather 3 others at diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> ages of Old Subtlety, Lord Say and Sele, ancestor of the said Twistleton.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fiennes (<date when="1582-00-00">1582</date>&#x2013;<date when="1662-00-00">1662</date>), 1st Viscount Saye and Sele, nicknamed Old Subtlety. Twisleton was a direct descendant. Robert Walker (d. <date when="1658-00-00">1658</date>?) painted portraits of Cromwell and other parliamentary leaders.</note> Just as we were going off (when Jane came with her &#x201C;alarm&#x201C;) a bearded child of Abraham, Neuberg&#x2019;s Brother, straight from Bonn, came in,&#x2014;very much at the wrong time;&#x2014;then farther there was a mistake in the Omnibuses &#x26;c: in short our expedition had its difficulties; but it went off very well; and here am I again writing to you, while the masons are still raging, and tea has not yet come.&#x2014; Twistleton, by the way, has just returned from a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> voyage to America, and this time, has brought a little Wife with him, whom he went for about the beginning of <date when="1852-05-00">May</date>! She is a black-eyed lively little creature, with abundant spirit, clever and rather eager to shew that she is; has money, I believe, as T<hi rend="italic">n</hi> has; was called <hi rend="italic">Dwight</hi>, and belonged to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">haute vol&#xE9;e</hi></foreign> [high rank] (bless the mark!) of that Boston Community.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellen, da. of Edward Dwight of Boston.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Judging by the Note you lately gave me of &#x201C;Copies on hand&#x201C; in reference to the other Books, I should say 750 w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the better number for <hi rend="italic">Heroes.</hi> You have hardly <hi rend="italic">above</hi> that number of any of the Books, and of some you have not 150,&#x2014;according to the above document.</p>
<p>I decidedly determine to have a <hi rend="italic">cheap edition</hi> of those Books, if not thro&#x2019; you (which I should be sorry at), then thro&#x2019; another; nay sometimes I have thought of having this particular Book done in a cheap form by itself, and the rest as they successively fall home to me.</p>
<p>This by post; in case I have not time to call today,&#x2014;or be baked into mutton before I get so far thro&#x2019; the heat.</p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>Unfortunately I have no time to give any but a cursory examination to your verses, much less than their ingenuity might promise to deserve; and I cannot therefore pretend to pronounce a vote upon your pursuits which is entitled to much consideration from you. But I am in the fixed habit, this long while back, of advising all young men of genius, whatever their qualifications, to eschew verse-writing, as at <hi rend="italic">best</hi> a very poor and idle pursuit, and very unsuitable to <supplied>[the?]</supplied> times, great as the <supplied>[&#x201C;reputation?&#x201C;]</supplied> &#x26;c of it may be. Nay, writing, in any shape, except where it is plainly unavoidable <supplied>[leads]</supplied> to questionable line of operation for a man of earnest purposes [3 or 4 words illegible] world. <pb id="pg-27-164" n="27:164"/>This will surprise you, especially from me who am by trade a writer and nothing else; but I can truly assure you it is my deliberate conviction, and whatever new insight new experience gives me, tends continually this long while to confirm it. Surely if a man have any real <hi rend="italic">harmony</hi> put into the soul of him by his Maker, it is much better that he <hi rend="italic">act</hi> it out of him than <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> it out of him! And if he absolutely must speak, all other courses being barred to him, let him at least honestly and plainly do so,&#x2014;not attempting to torture himself into <hi rend="italic">singing</hi> what he means, in these most <hi rend="italic">un</hi>singing times of ours!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Believe me</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Mr. Erskine,&#x2014;</salute>I foresee that, by stress of weather and of other evil circumstances, I shall, in spite of my reluctance and inertia, be driven out of this shelter of mine&#x2014;where I have already fled into the topmost corner with a few books; and, aided by a watering-pot, would so gladly defend myself as at first I hoped to do. The blaze of heat is almost intolerable to everybody; and alas! we, in addition, have the house full of workers, armed with planes, saws, pickaxes, dust-boxes, mortar-hods, the two upper storeys getting a &#x201C;complete repair&#x201C; which hitherto fills everything with noise, dust, confusion, and premonitions of despair. I foresee, especially if this hot weather holds, that I shall have to run. My wife, who is architect and factotum, will retire to some neighbour&#x2019;s house and sleep; but cannot leave the ground till she <hi rend="italic">sees</hi> these two upper storeys made into her image of them. I have fled into a dressing-room far aloft; sit there very busy with certain books, also with watering-pot, which, all carpets &#x26;c. being off, is a great help to me. Here I would so gladly hold out; but in spite of wholesome and unwholesome inertias, shall too probably be obliged to fly. Whitherward? is now the question, and I am looking round on various azimuths to answer the same. Tell me, if you are, or are likely to be, tolerably solitary for a ten days at Linlathen, and about what time. A draught attracts me thither, so as to few other places. But alas! in <hi rend="italic">every</hi> way there lie lions for me, weak in body and strong in imagination as I am. It seems sometimes as if, could you leave me daily six hours strictly private for my German reading, and send me down once a day to bathe in your glorious sea, I could try well not to be sulky company at other hours, and might do very well beside so friendly a soul as yours is to me always. Tell me, at any <pb id="pg-27-165" n="27:165"/>rate, how you are situated, and regard this pious thought, whether it becomes an action or not, as proof of my quiet trust in you. Hearty good wishes to all.</p>

If you lived in a country place, and did not fall in with the cants and the pietisms of the little sets there, they pointed the finger at you, and there was no living quietly for them. Now, here in London, you could walk abroad, and say to everybody far and wide&#x2014;&#x2018;Keep off me! I am nothing to you, nor you to me.&#x2019; And with a morsel of food, and decent raiment, and a book&#x2014;then you were independent of everybody. Yes, after all&#x2014;and if London was under certain aspects, a hateful place&#x2014;yet there was a kind of epic grandeur about it, too.&#x201C; Speaking of current fiction about women, TC told Hannay that &#x201C;it would be better for women themselves to be sternly governed by their husbands,&#x201C; as Chriemhild was in the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungen Lied.</hi> &#x201C;But indeed there was no notion of Government anywhere now. Somebody to govern him was what he had been wishing for all his life. In his youth he was naturally obedient. You could not even get a servant in London. A servant was not a man who obeyed his master, but a fellow he had to bribe. England had wandered away from all ideas of government, and many generations,&#x2014;long-suffering generations to come, would pay the penalty of it&#x201C; (MS: Univ. of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana; pbd: &#x201C;Three Carlyle Documents,&#x201C; ed.

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>I might be excused for forgetting my own birthday<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1852-07-14">14 July</date>.</note> this time, and even my own <hi rend="italic">name</hi>, and address, and everything about me, except the one terrific fact that I am in a house under what is called &#x201C;thorough repair&#x201C;!&#x2014; Having never had to do with London workmen, you cannot form any adequate idea of the thing&#x2014;workmen who spend three fourths of their time in <hi rend="italic">consulting how the work should be done</hi> and in going out and in after &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">beer</hi>&#x201C; were not, at least, in my day, known in Scotland and then &#x201C;a thorough repair,&#x201C; complicated by the altering of chimnies and partitions and by heat at eighty two degrees in the shade, were a wild piece of work with any sort of workmen!&#x2014; The Builder<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;This was the year (only first year, alas!) of repairing our house; &#x2018;architect&#x2019; (Helps&#x2019;s) was &#x2018;Mr. Morgan,&#x2019; a very honest man, and with workmen honest though inexpert; he himself had no talent for managing the chaos he created here, and indeed he at length fell sick, and left it to end by collapse. My own little heroine was manager, eye, inventress, commandress, guiding head and soul of everything; and made (witness this drawing-room, and compare it with the original, i.e. with every other in the street) a real triumph of what without her would have been a puddle of wasteful failure. She feared no toil howsoever unfit for her, had a marked &#x2018;talent in architecture,&#x2019; too&#x2014;in fact, the universal talent of applying intellect, veracity, and courage to things gone awry for want of those qualities. My noble darling! few women have had such an outfit of talent, far fewer such a loving nobleness and truth of heart to urge it into action and guide it there. Meanwhile, to escape those horrors of heat and dust, I fled (or indeed was dismissed) to Linlathen, to my excellent T. Erskine&#x2019;s, where I morbidly and painfully stayed three weeks, gentlest and best of hospitality able to do little for me. I remember trying to bathe in the summer mornings&#x2014;bad bathing coast. Most of my leisure went in translating what is now the Appendix to <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi>, vol. vii of 2nd edition.&#x2014;TC.&#x201C; (Headnote in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> <pb id="pg-27-166" n="27:166"/>promised to have all done in six weeks, painting included&#x2014;if he get done in six <hi rend="italic">months</hi> it is as much as I hope!&#x2014; Meanwhile I run about in the great heat,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A further visit at the hottest time of the year must have been paid by G. H. Lewes, recounted by Thomas Baynes, &#x201C;An Evening with Thomas Carlyle,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1887-04-02">2 April 1887</date>, 449&#x2013;50; Baynes&#x2019;s dates are not exactly correct, but it must have been about now, before TC left for Linlathen on <date when="1852-07-21">21 July</date>. They discussed the conduct of the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>, the weather, and TC&#x2019;s scorn for Auguste Comte (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), the Positivist philosopher, about whom Lewes had been writing: &#x201C;I looked into Comte some years ago, and soon found he was one of those creatures that bind the universe up into bundles, and sets them all in a row like <foreign>stooks</foreign> in a field &#x2026; . I was soon done with him.&#x201C; TC spoke of Dickens, and of Helps&#x2019;s latest work, then to Baynes of his memories of Sir William Hamilton. Baynes heard a &#x201C;peculiar gentleness in his tone, an accent of deep and sincere feeling,&#x201C; in speaking of Hamilton and the crippled state he had been left in by a recent attack of paralysis. JWC was &#x201C;chatty and pleasant, though rather incisive in speech and manner.&#x201C; Thomas Spencer Baynes (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1887-00-00">87</date>), writer and philosopher, taught philosophy at the Edinburgh Philosophical Institution, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>; assisted Sir William Hamilton with his teaching, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>; ed. <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Guardian</hi>, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">60</date>; assist.-ed. <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">66</date>.</note> carrying all my furniture in my arms from one room to another&#x2014;and sleep or rather <hi rend="italic">lie about</hi> like a dog&#x2014;just where I see a cleared space&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> am needed here to keep the workmen from falling into continual mistakes&#x2014;but why M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle who is anything rather than <hi rend="italic">needed</hi> stays on, I cant imagine&#x2014;nor do I know when I shall get away nor where I shall go&#x2014; We were to have gone both of us to Germany but that is all knocked on the head now&#x2014;at least for the present&#x2014; If you saw me sitting in the midst of falling bricks, and clouds of lime dust, and a noise as of battering rams you wouldnt wonder that I should make my letter brief&#x2014; The poor little sweet briar grew threw all the east winds and was flourishing beautifully when heavy rains came and killed it&#x2014; I am so vexed and cant help feeling the sweet briars unwillingness to grow with me a bad omen somehow&#x2014; I wonder if you will be goodnatured and unwearied enough to send me another <hi rend="italic">slip</hi>, to try when the right time comes?&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now to the business; will you lay out five shillings on Old Mary in some judicious way for me, and will you give my little packet to Margaret<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hiddlestone.</note> and tell <pb id="pg-27-167" n="27:167"/>them I still think of them both kindly. I had a great hope very vague but quite probable that I should have gone to Scotland this summer and seen you <hi rend="italic">somewhere</hi> now everything is unsettled with the talk about Germany and the fact of this house altering&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Frank</salute>
<p>I should have returned your letters sooner if I had not been driven from post to pillar all these days as I never was before in my life tho&#x2019; I have undergone <hi rend="italic">three <foreign>Flittings</foreign></hi> and plenty of <hi rend="italic">occasional</hi> house-earthquakes.</p>
<p>All the last week I have not even had my natural rest till six in the morning, when the men burst in and thunder all over the house&#x2014;for I had no bed to sleep in, but must just move about and lie down like a dog wherever I saw a little clear space.</p>
<p>The want of sleep and the thermometer at 80 in the shade, and the crash of doom around me, and in the midst of all M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C needing to be kept safe and clean and <hi rend="italic">cool</hi> at the top of the house makes a complication</p>
<p>I have taken back the little girl I had during my servants illness to specially go after M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C with a watering pan to keep his floors continually wet and dustless as he requires them!&#x2014; Then my natural Servant leaves on Tuesday next, and tho the new one looks <hi rend="italic">beautiful</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sweet</hi>, as the angels god knows how she can cook and scrub.</p>
<p>I have heard nothing more of the Newtons and I should think never shall, for to all M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newtons entreaties that I &#x201C;would forgive Nodes, and <hi rend="italic">try him once more</hi>&#x201C;!! I answered that the last three times M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> N had got into my house it had been purely by the mistake of my Servant who was ordered to exclude him&#x2014;and that <hi rend="italic">now</hi> nothing on earth could ever induce me to be in the &#x201C;same room with that man&#x201C;&#x2014; At first she was inclined to <hi rend="italic">resent</hi> what I said about him and then she wept bitterly and said she had only forgiven him herself when he <hi rend="italic">fell ill of it</hi>&#x2014;and took to bed and couldnt eat&#x2014;He had as usual told her beautiful excuses, throwing all the blame like a cowardly rascal as he is on the woman Jackson&#x2014;who really seems <hi rend="italic">worthy</hi> of him!</p>
<p>Why dont Geraldine write me a line in my difficulties&#x2014; God knows what is going to become of us&#x2014;the house I am sure wont be done these six months! <pb id="pg-27-168" n="27:168"/>and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C takes no step to get out of it&#x2014;still however talks of Germany for us both by and by</p>
<closer><salute>Yours very truly /</salute></closer> <name>Jane Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newtons note to you is marvellous&#x2014;who could have believed such a bitter insolent spirit in her!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Newton wrote to Frank Jewsbury from 6 and 7 New Park St. / Southwark, replying to his letter drafted <date when="1852-07-04">4 July</date>: &#x201C;I acknowledge your last note with thanks for the polite manner in which you address yourself to me. I am writing M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle by this post to say that you are not the person in question and to state who <hi rend="italic">is</hi> and <hi rend="italic">was.</hi> <foreign>viz.</foreign> one that you know, and knew at the time to have had letters addressed to him under the immortal name of Jews<hi rend="italic">berry.</hi> / I just once repeat that I never said to your messenger (a lawyer!) that &#x2018;you were a liar &#x26; a coward.&#x2019; I said that &#x2018;lying &#x26; cowardice generally go together.&#x2019; Nor did I say that if you would call upon me I would tell you all / I did say &#x2018;What I have to say I will tell M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Jewsbury when I see him.&#x2019; and I then told you all I then knew&#x201C; (MS: NLS 2883.213).</note></p>
<p>Oh dear I ha<supplied>[ve]</supplied> forgotten Carlyles thankful message about the picture which he burnt in the kitchen <hi rend="italic">himself</hi> five minutes after it came to hand. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sic transit gloria mundi</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial and from the service on the Pope&#x2019;s enthronement.

<p><salute>Oh dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Neuberg!</salute> Did I ever tell you of the Anan Baillie who when his health was drunk at a public dinner, and he had risen to speak, could find no words to express his feelings but &#x201C;Oh Gentlemen!

In a note, now with the letter, the cup is said to have had &#x201C;a representation of the &#x2018;Seven Mountains&#x2019; near Bonn on the Rhine.&#x201C;</note> it was only because you were not there to hear! Upon my honour I was never more surprised in my life or more <hi rend="italic">touched!</hi> tho&#x2019; I have a natural tendency to being <hi rend="italic">touched</hi>&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">moi!</hi></foreign> Your remembrance of my poor little Birthday for so long a time and at such a distance, made visible and palpable for me in the form of that most beautiful of cups, was indeed something to stand amazed before &#x201C;as in presence of the Infinite&#x201C;! and something for which to thank my husbands friends &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Gods</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;something to almost reconcile me for the moment to the questionable fact of having been verily <hi rend="small-caps">born</hi>!&#x2014;thanks then to Joseph and Rosetta&#x2014;the heartiest thanks! And they are to know that their poetical intention was punctually and safely &#x201C;carried out&#x201C;&#x2014;the cup and saucer were placed in my hands on the 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, and without crack or damage of any sort. And now while I write I have those lovely mountains before me and wish myself there&#x2014;but alas! the German project lies buried for the present under a chaos of pulled down chimnies and <hi rend="italic">partitions</hi>, clouds of lime dust and crash, as of Doom! the thermo<supplied>[me]</supplied>ter all the while at 80 in the shade, and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C still &#x201C;hanging on by the eyelids&#x201C; (as sailors say) to his usual life of <hi rend="italic">study with dignity!</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cicero, &#x201C;<foreign>cum dignitate otium</foreign>,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Pro Sestio</hi> 45.98.</note> For we have taken a lease of this house for thirty one years!

<p>Our house is full of masons, joiners, plumbers &#x26;c &#x26;c and like to be for a long while; the heat too is intense, tho&#x2019; the air is always brisk; and in the country, I can see, all w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be beautiful. I design accordingly to fly,&#x2014;off to Scotland, by the Dundee Steamer either of Wednesday first or Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> second; there I will try to hold out till towards the middle of <date when="1852-08-00">August</date> (my wife continuing here as <foreign><hi rend="italic">Baudirectorin</hi></foreign> [building manager], with short runs into the country),&#x2014;after which the German speculation will rise in all its majesty again! Oh that I had <hi rend="italic">wings</hi>,&#x2014;instead of only <hi rend="italic">feet</hi>, and distracted screaming railways, sleepless h&#xF4;tels, and the fatal &#x26;c! However, if I ever mean to do anything with Fr<hi rend="italic">k</hi>, it is absolutely necessary I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> try to go; and the sooner the better for the practical effects of it, of course. We by no means fling down the enterprise; only we are weak, we are weary, lazy too&#x2014;alas, alas!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came yesternight; and was very welcome, tho&#x2019; brief. We expect a longer soon!&#x2014; I scarcely know whether I myself have 10 minutes, or only 5, to finish this, and to <hi rend="italic">dress</hi> for the streets: at any rate I have evidently not a second to lose!</p>
<p>The hurlyburly goes on here as before; the uproar fully equal to our fears, the <hi rend="italic">progress</hi> alas very much behind our hopes! However, we have no resource but to be patient; he is reported and seems to be a very honest man in whose hands we are: and evidently they are making ready a considerable improvement in the upper portions of this house. The heat of the weather is a sad aggravation; with that and the early noise, it becomes nearly impossible to get enough of sleep for the agitated human tabernacle: more than once poor Jane and I have <hi rend="italic">met</hi>, out of lairs at 1 a.m., and smoked a silent pipe, with very little clothing indeed, down in the garden. Even Nero the Dog is rather unhappy. However, we had a thunderstorm last night; it surprised Jane &#x26; me in Cheyne Walk, and drove us into a ginshop for half an hour: a perfect Niagara of rain, tho&#x2019; the thunder was very gentle. Today there is damp lowering <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> still, and the rain is clearly not <hi rend="italic">done;</hi>&#x2014;it will help us all a little, our poor old Mother at Scotsbrig and us here too!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-173" n="27:173"/>Meanwhile I had decided that there could be no good <hi rend="italic">continuing</hi> here till the job were done; that in fact <hi rend="italic">I</hi> ought to get away: I once gone, Jane w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go to sleep in Darwin&#x2019;s empty house, go on little visits &#x26;c, and be much better, while <hi rend="italic">architecting</hi> here. In brief, I wrote to Thomas Erskine: &#x201C;charmed to see me, and they are quite alone&#x201C;;&#x2014;so <hi rend="italic">thither</hi> I am bound, if not by the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Dundee Steamer (of the 21st), then by the next of the 28<hi rend="italic">th</hi>: that is <hi rend="italic">settled.</hi> &#x201C;Ten days&#x201C; at Linlathen (&#x201C;a bathe, and 6 hours every day to myself);&#x2014;after which, I think you may tell my Mother, I will wend towards Annandale again. Germany still hovers in the distance, as possible, nay as necessary; but surely Annandale, and the precious things that lie there, will be first!&#x2014; I will write again, if I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> sail on Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> first; if <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">certainly.</hi></p>
<p>This N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Revue des 2 Mondes</hi>, which you must interpret to my Mother, will amuse you a little; it belongs to <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi>, and I am to bid you take all care of that hideous French Portrait!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#xc9;mile Mont&#xE9;gut, &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle et John Sterling,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi> 15 (<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>): 133&#x2013;64; the portrait is opp. 133, redrawn from the familiar Samuel Laurence portrait used by Froude, frontispiece for <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, vol. 3, re-engraved by G.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here I am, just arrived, after a very favourable voyage, which was not unpleasant during the transaction of it, and has done no ill, but rather, if anything, good.&#x2014; As they are about sending off to the post, I think it better to write this, for my good Mother&#x2019;s sake, without any delay, tho&#x2019; properly I have nothing else to write.</p>
<p>They are not &#x201C;solitary&#x201C; here, as I had half fancied; on the contrary there is a goodly assemblage of ladies and gentlemen (<foreign><hi rend="italic">unbedeutenden</hi></foreign> [insignificant]) young and old: but the weather is delightful, the Summer still in all its glory here; the Sea too is within reach (where I mean to go bathing this very day): and daily, by bargain, I am to have six hours for my own private reading:&#x2014;so, to all appearance, I shall do very well for my term of &#x201C;ten days.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Jane came with me down the River, to the Steamer itself, and did not quit till we were just going to sail: she and Nero returned in the boat again (from <pb id="pg-27-176" n="27:176"/>below the St Katharine Docks),&#x2014;and were soon lost to me amid the shipping of the Pool.</p>
<p>Tell my Mother all these things to keep her good heart easy. And write to me here,&#x2014;as minutely as your convenience will allow, about everything that is going on round you.&#x2014; Tell Jamie I see showers here, and a great appearance of crop: the fields were <hi rend="italic">white</hi> for the sickle<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 4:35.</note> about the mouth of the Thames, but I did not notice anything cut.</p>

<p>Well my Dear, here I am; as well as when you left me, if not a little better: this is the essential fact, and as the post seems just to be making off, I suppose I shall have to pretty much confine myself to this.</p>
<p>&#x2014;You and Nero vanishing amid the ships of the Pool<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Thames for some way below London Bridge.</note> were a <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> kind of sight to me in my then and subsequent condition of imagination: if I had a word to say that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> and he got home all right, and with<hi rend="italic">t more</hi> bother from that knave of a boatman, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very welcome! The Letter I wrote to Erskine on Wednesday had just arrived here an hour or so before I came: you can count that for future guidance.</p>
<p>I got on very well in the Steamer; was nearly <hi rend="italic">utterly</hi> silent; found everybody civil &#x26; every<hi rend="italic">thing</hi> tolerably what it should be; the weather was of the best (that first evening Twilight with the ships all hanging in it at the Thames Mouth, like black shadows on a ground of crimson, was a sight to make anybody give way to the picturesque, for a few minutes occasion): I passed almost all my time in reading; smoked, too; and looked, with infinite sorrow yet not unblessed or angry sorrow, into the Continents of <hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi>, as is my sad wont on such occasions. I even contrived to get a berth (by good management) where I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> a door to shut upon myself, and a torrent of wind running over me all night; where, accordingly, I managed to sleep tolerably well both nights,&#x2014;and am, as I said, really better rather than worse.</p>
<p>We had some flurry shifting here at Dundee, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> directly on to the Pier, but mediately into a &#x201C;little Steamer&#x201C; (there not being water enough); our expected time of landing (I was surprised to find) was 8 a.m.; however, we did <pb id="pg-27-177" n="27:177"/>not land till after 10. No carriage was waiting; which, however, only cost me an additional 5 /, and no kind of additional inconvenience whatever. I found the good Thomas walking under the cool of the trees, not far from the house; I jumped out of my cab and was warmly welcomed by the good man.&#x2014; They are not &#x201C;solitary&#x201C;: far from it! A goodly bevy of visitors male and female, young and old, are here (just eating <hi rend="italic">lunch</hi> in these minutes) a strange lady (name not <hi rend="italic">caught</hi>) was bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in since I came to write here,&#x2014;&#x201C;to be introduced to you Mr Carlyle,&#x201C;&#x2014;she is <hi rend="italic">leaving</hi>, I think the very rooms to which I am coming! Heigho; I am a good deal <hi rend="italic">flushed</hi> too; no quiet yet, nor to be looked for till night. I will join lunch for a glass of wine-and-water; I will bathe in the sea, and endeavour to be as <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> as I can. I have written a word to John (here, in Erskine&#x2019;s room, the stillest coolest of rooms); &#x26; so will end my writing for today. Give Nero a crumb of sugar in my name, poor wretch. <closer><salute>God bless you ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Geraldine</salute>
<p>Pray advise Frank not to send me any more letters while his present humour holds out&#x2014; The last has done more to set my heart against him than any number of Newton fictions could ever have done&#x2014;it is so&#x2014;&#x201C;what shall I say?&#x201C;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">spiteful!</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi>, above all people I have been used to consider free as the angels from every sort of unkindly thing! Another such letter would <hi rend="italic">end</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">all</hi> between us&#x2014;so I <hi rend="italic">absolutely will not read</hi> another&#x2014;till I know from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, that he is pacified towards me. I am very sorry indeed that I should have vexed him so much&#x2014;and very angry at <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> for having been so indiscreet&#x2014;tho it is not my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> impression that I &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">volunteered</hi> the statement&#x201C;&#x2014;to the best of my recollection when we were speaking of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newton Frank asked &#x201C;has she found out yet who wrote the letters to her Husband?&#x201C; and when I answered &#x201C;Oh <hi rend="italic">that</hi> she <hi rend="italic">has;</hi> knows all about it&#x2014;and the letters were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to Nodes after all!&#x201C; that Frank said several times over &#x201C;do tell me&#x2014;do tell me&#x2014;please do&#x201C;&#x2014;that is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> impression but if Frank is positive it is incorrect&#x2014;why then I have remembered wrong&#x2014;as I am apt enough to do&#x2014; Nor does it much signify which of us began the subject&#x2014;since in any case it behoved me as a well-bred woman (not to dream of saying a wise one) to have held my peace on what I had heard. As to &#x201C;the stranger&#x201C;&#x2014;on above account Frank seems to have been <hi rend="italic">most</hi> annoyed with me. will you make him understand that &#x201C;the Stranger&#x201C; knows absolutely nothing of <hi rend="italic">him</hi> (Frank) or the subject&#x2014; <pb id="pg-27-178" n="27:178"/>that the Stranger tho&#x2019; speaking English in a slow way, well enough to carry on conversation with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> himself, is quite lost in the rapid talk carried on betwixt other people, especially when of the <hi rend="italic">out of the way</hi> sort such as Frank and I were going on with&#x2014;moreover that if he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have <hi rend="italic">understood</hi> that I told Frank &#x201C;he was <hi rend="italic">lying</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;(as Frank says I did) in his presence&#x2014;he knows <hi rend="italic">me</hi> so well and has so good an opinion of me, that he would have felt sure without further explanation, I was using the expression in some other sense than a grave, accusing one, <hi rend="italic">since he saw me there going thro the forms of <hi rend="small-caps">friendship</hi> with the man I so addressed</hi>.</p>
<p>So do dear Geraldine pour oil on the waters of this absurd little tempest we have made from my taking up the thing in this <hi rend="italic">depracoting</hi> way instead of in my usual proud fiery way you may see the real liking I have for Frank and the sense I have of all his kindnesses to me&#x2014; But I cant promise to hold out against another spiteful word from him&#x2014; In fact wont <hi rend="italic">open</hi> another letter from him till he is pacified</p>

<p><salute>Oh <hi rend="italic">my!</hi></salute> I wonder if I shall hear tomorrow morning, and <hi rend="italic">what</hi> I shall hear! Perhaps that somebody drove you wild with <hi rend="italic">snoring</hi>, and that you killed him and threw him in sea! Had the Boatmen upset the boat on the way back and drowned little Nero and me on purpose, I could hardly have taken it ill of them, seeing they &#x201C;were but <hi rend="italic">men</hi>, of like passions with yourself&#x201C;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Acts 14:15; and see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520716-JWC-JN-01"><sic>27:169</sic><corr>JWC to JN, <date when="1852-07-16">16 July 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; But on the contrary they behaved most civilly to us, offered to land us at any pier we liked, and said not a word to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> about <hi rend="italic">the sixpence</hi>, so I gave it to them as a free gift&#x2014; We came straight home in the steamer, where Nero went immediately to sleep and I to work. Miss Wilson called in the afternoon, extremely agreeable, and after tea Ballantyne came, and soon after Kingsley.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Wilson, Thomas Ballantyne (see <ref target="volume-26/ed-26-biographical-notes"><sic>26:290</sic><corr>26:biographical note</corr></ref>), Charles Kingsley.</note> Ballantyne gave me the ten pounds,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Borrowed, doubtless&#x201C; (Note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> and Kingsley told me about his Wife&#x2014;that she was &#x201C;the adorablest wife man ever had&#x201C;! I was extremely happy to hear it and hoped she might continue so. neither of these men staid long. I went to bed at eleven, fell asleep at three, and rose at six. The two Plumbers were rushing about the Kitchen with boiling lead, an additional Carpenter was waiting for <pb id="pg-27-179" n="27:179"/>my directions about &#x201C;the cupboard&#x201C; at the bottom of the kitchen stairs&#x2014; The two usual Carpenters were hammering at the floor and windows of the drawingroom&#x2014; The Bricklayer rushed in <hi rend="italic">in plain clothes</hi> measured the windows for stone <hi rend="italic">sills</hi> (?) rushed out again and came no more that day&#x2014;after breakfast I fell to clearing out the front bedroom for the Bricklayers, removing every thing into <hi rend="italic">your</hi> room&#x2014;when I had just finished a wild looking stranger with a paper cap rushed up the stairs, three at a time, and told me he was &#x201C;sent by M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan to get on with the painting of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s bedroom during his absence&#x201C;!! I was so taken by surprise that I did not feel at first to have any choice in the matter&#x2014;and told him he must wait two hours till all the furniture was taken&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">somewhere!</hi> then I came in mind that the window and doors had to be repaired&#x2014;and a little later that&#x2014;the floor was to be taken up!&#x2014; Being desirous however not to refuse the good the Gods had provided me,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dryden, &#x201C;Alexander&#x2019;s Feast,&#x201C; 106.</note> I told the man he might begin to paint in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> bedroom&#x2014;but there also some woodwork was unfinished&#x2014;the carpenter thought they could get it ready by next morning&#x2014;so I next cleared myself a road into <hi rend="italic">your</hi> bed and fell to moving all the things of mine up there also, Certainly no Lady in London did such a hard days work not a soul came to interrupt me till night when Fairy<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Farie.</note> stalked in for half an hour uncommonly dull&#x2014;&#x201C;it must have taken a great deal to make a man so dull as <hi rend="italic">that!</hi>&#x201C; I never went out till ten at night when I took a turn or two on Battersea bridge, without having my throat cut&#x2014; My attempts at sleeping last night were even more futile than the preceeding one&#x2014;a dog howled <hi rend="italic">repeatedly</hi>, near hand, in that awful manner which is understood to prognosticate death, which together with being &#x201C;in a new position&#x201C; kept me awake till <hi rend="italic">five.</hi> and after six it was impossible to lie&#x2014;for the Plumbers were in the garret, and the bricklayers in the front bedroom! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan came after breakfast and settled to take up the floor in your bedroom at once&#x2014;so today all the things have had to be moved out again down to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> bedroom&#x2014;and the painter put off&#x2014;and tonight I am to &#x201C;pursue <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> under difficulties&#x201C;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Pursuit of Knowledge Under Difficulties</hi>, &#x26;c.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I arrived here from London; and, this morning, your Letter of the 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> ult<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, enclosing a Draft for Twenty Pounds, has followed me; of which I lose not a moment in giving you notice.</p>
<p>A long time ago the Booksellers Sampson &#x26; Philips<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Phillips &#x26; Sampson.</note> (if that is the name) sent me word that they had paid you, to account of the Book <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi>, such and such a number of Dollars, amounting to such and such a Sum Sterling: but this was all I ever heard of it till this morning; your Letter of <date when="1852-03-30">March</date> (or <date when="1852-05-30">May) 30</date> with its enclosure having by some accident gone altogether astray. The Samson Letter is in a drawer at Chelsea, and you shall have it, along with a Copy of the Book <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi>, when I return,&#x2014;which is not yet to be for a good many weeks, I hope.</p>
<p>I have fled from London to be out of the heat; came off by Steam, and am here suddenly amid excellent old friends, in the most charming shade and seclusion and native fresh air.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many thanks for all the trouble you take, and many regards and good wishes, I remain always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dearest Kate</salute>
<p>It were well worth your while to drive up from Hedley<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Headley Grove, Anthony Sterling&#x2019;s farm nr. Betchworth, Surrey.</note> just to take a look of this house, in which I live and move and have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> my being! You would then need no excuses for silence! That I write to you at all in such an earthquake is of itself a proof that I like you better than most people. Every thing getting torn down and nothing getting put up, and the furniture gathering itself (oh if it would but gather <hi rend="italic">itself!</hi>) into larger and more chaotic heaps, as more flooring is lifted and more chimnies pulled down;&#x2014;more and wilder men turned loose on the premises&#x2014;a new servant, who cannot recover from the bewilderment of the scene in which she finds herself; and no composure nor help nor hope but in my own head and hands, to keep me from being swallowed up in the general mess! My dear, if your future Husband, that <hi rend="italic">Englishman</hi> you are to marry one day, should ever propose getting a house &#x201C;made habitable&#x201C; for you, go down on your knees to persuade him rather to remove into a house already &#x201C;habitable,&#x201C; for to have no regular bed to sleep in, and to dress with two carpenters in your room and to be constantly powdered with lime and choked with dust, all that is no joke! And I cant get out of it, at least England expects of me to remain, for it is my &#x201C;duty&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;England expects every man will do his duty,&#x201C; Nelson&#x2019;s signal at Trafalgar.</note>&#x2014; There is no one else to superintend all these men&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">eight</hi> of them we have now, and without my universal genius to fall back on they would be falling into mistakes and Impossibilities world without end&#x2014; It was but yesterday I prevented Painters falling to work in a room of which the floor was to be new laid! I had great hopes that in the tearing up of so many old boards a treasure would be found&#x2014;and told the men to keep a sharp look out but as yet only <hi rend="italic">one halfpenny</hi> has come to light. the head Carpenter came to me very gravely yesterday and showing an old black halfpenny, bearing the date <date when="1708-00-00">1708</date> said &#x201C;they had not been able to find anything but <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; I gave him a shilling for it&#x2014;</p>
<p>I never see your Uncle by any chance&#x2014; He wrote to me that he had not tried for his membership and that is all the news I have had of him these six weeks&#x2014; Baron Dalwig came yesterday to bid me farewell, kissed my hand very affectionately, and received a copy of The <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi> from me&#x2014;in memory not of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, but of us&#x2014; He has conducted himself here in a way to <pb id="pg-27-182" n="27:182"/>win my sincere <hi rend="italic">esteem</hi> as well as affection, and I wish him a good German wife with all my heart. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle fled into Scotland last Wednesday, an inexpressible relief!&#x2014;for the bother of keeping up the forms of civilization in the present circumstances was perfectly maddening&#x2014;Besides I care comparatively nothing about material discomforts, when I see nobody else put out of sorts by them&#x2014; I have the dearest little girl of fifteen&#x2014;the one who was with me in Ann&#x2019;s sickness wanting <hi rend="italic">a place</hi>&#x2014; She <hi rend="italic">reads</hi> beautifully and writes beautifully and <hi rend="italic">sews</hi> beautifully has the most <hi rend="italic">soothing</hi> manners, and the most upright dispositions&#x2014;should you want any such creature tell me I should like you to have her&#x2014; <closer><salute>Affectionately yours</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Thanks, many thanks, dear little soul, for the Note I got this morning.</salute> You know not what a crowd of ugly confusions it delivered me from, or what black webs I was weaving in my chaotic thoughts, while I heard nothing from you here! For I am terribly bilious, tho&#x2019; it might be hard to say why, everything is so delightfully kind and appropriate here,&#x2014;weather, place, people, bedroom, treatment all so much &#x201C;better than I deserve.&#x201C; But one&#x2019;s imagination is a black smithy of the cyclops where strange things are incessantly forged.&#x2014; &#x2014; Let me tell you here what the law of the post seems to be, for avoiding future disappointments. My letter will go to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (if no mistake be made, and I get in at Broughty Ferry<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >4 mi. ENE of Dundee. The postmark shows that the letter was posted there.</note> about 3 p.m.) in 24 hours;&#x2014;that is to say, you will get this Note (of Monday) tomorrow Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> about 3: wherefore I infer you did hear from me on Saturday, tho&#x2019; at a later hour? On the other hand, <hi rend="italic">your</hi> letter to me will, at soonest, except by favourable accidents, take 36 hours to arrive,&#x2014;and mark <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, you may post the letter (in the Sloane-Square or some other London post-office) <hi rend="italic">as late</hi> at night as you like; if it be in a London post-office <hi rend="italic">before</hi> 8 in the morning, it will be here about the same hour <hi rend="italic">next</hi> morning: so you see it has to lie some dozen hours or more before it ever <hi rend="italic">start</hi>, that is the law of it. Do I make you &#x201C;sinsible&#x201C; (as the Irish say)? Attend to the law, for it is inflexible, whether you understand it or not.</p>
<p>Terrible <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi>, my poor little creature; I fear it will tatter you all to pieces: I wish I heard you were fairly away to Darwin&#x2019;s to sleep. <hi rend="italic">After</hi> Sherburne at least, I strictly recommend you to adopt that course: the ride or walk <pb id="pg-27-183" n="27:183"/>down every morning will itself do you good. And take care of yourself; don&#x2019;t go all to fiddlestrings upon my hands, it will never do!</p>
<p>The Yankee letter you forwarded was from the &#x201C;E. P. Clark,&#x201C; my Manager at Boston; a most scraggy herring bone of a Composition; and enclosed, for <hi rend="italic">The Life of Sterling</hi>, not &#xa3;25 as the other Yankee had announced, but with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> any explanation &#xa3;20 only; which I sent off instantly to Adamson to negociate; instantly answering the E. P. Clark, and politely <hi rend="italic">reserving</hi> all criticism of the odd <hi rend="italic">five pounds:</hi> I will send him silently the other Yankee letter (which is about my drawers, I think the upper or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> drawer; take care of it); that will be criticism enough: and in the meanwhile let us accept the &#xa3;20 as a kindly windfal tho&#x2019; a smallish one.&#x2014; I next day got a newspaper from you; which was instantaneously forwarded to my Mother. And this (with a ghost of a Note, one page, from John this morning along with yours) is all the correspondence I have rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> or written, since I came here. So much the better; the less the bother, with most <hi rend="italic">select</hi> exceptions! In fact, I have had a good deal of writing otherwise: a <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> thing I had begun to translate at Chelsea; I fancied there were still 4 days works in it, but here (at 2 p.m.) after <hi rend="italic">three</hi> good diligent days (laborious under difficulties), I find myself at the end of it;&#x2014;and now shall have mainly <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> to do henceforth, which as I can transact it in the open air, under the beech-tree shades, will be a far wholesomer operation. My <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> go half-blind, all these three days, after about an hours writing: the sign of extreme liver-derange<hi rend="italic">t;</hi> the fruit also in part of this low flat table, so inferior to my own noble one at Chelsea. I shall not now need to write; may abstain with a good conscience, till these black biliary tumults compose themselves again.</p>
<p>Our gay younger company went all off in the course of Saturday, much to my satisfaction&#x2014;tho&#x2019; there was a certain <hi rend="italic">younger</hi> &#x201C;Mrs Stirling&#x201C; (I shall clearly never learn the genealogies!) &#x201C;who is for Italy this winter,&#x201C; who sang some Scotch songs very well. Among the youths was a whiskered Cavalry officer (I hope of the <hi rend="italic">lowest</hi> grade), an exact <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> Lord Bath,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like John Alexander Thynne, marquess of Bath. Mrs. Stirling and the cavalry officer are unidentified.</note>&#x2014;nicknamed &#x201C;the Hatter&#x201C; by his comrades. He has a young Irish wife; a <hi rend="italic">wasp</hi> came buzzing to her at dinner; the Hatter got out with hot water, a sieve, and his Irish groom; and nobly, tho&#x2019; with some stings, destroyed the whole <foreign><hi rend="italic">byke</hi></foreign>. For the rest, a very foolish young man: surely, as you say of Farie&#x2019;s dulness: it must take a great deal of work to make such a fool!&#x2014; Our party was now suddenly contracted to three; and there it still stays (thank<hi rend="italic">s</hi> God), only in the course of the same Saturday there came two <hi rend="italic">reserved</hi> women&#x2014;who only breakfast with us, and sit silent in the ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> drawing room;&#x2014;a pale, pulmonary-looking otherwise <pb id="pg-27-184" n="27:184"/>pretty Swiss Governess (of extreme orthodoxy, who has one of Mrs Stirling&#x2019;s girls at her knee), and a queer ancient entirely <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi>-looking, prim, clean, purse-mouthed gentlewoman; whom I never rightly looked at till this morning: but I saw then she had something in the good old eyes of her; and I mean to inquire and investigate a little farther. She is rich in genealogies; and I dare say in old Scotch habitudes, which are growing quite original now. Today, I find, Miss Graham-Stirling (or <hi rend="italic">vice-versa?</hi>) has been invited to dine here;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clementine Stirling Graham (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>), da. of Patrick Stirling of Pittendreich in Forfar, a Dundee merchant, who had married the heiress of Duntrune, which Miss Graham inherited. Her mother was descended from John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee. She was a close neighbor and good friend of Thomas Erskine, loved by her dependents and all who knew her, especially in the early <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> circle. She was famed in Edinburgh society for her amusing private impersonations of old Scottish gentlewomen, such as the fictitious &#x201C;Lady Pitlyal,&#x201C; which took in Jeffrey, Walter Scott, Lord Rutherford, and others, which she described in her privately printed <hi rend="italic">Mystifications</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>); see Dr. John Brown, &#x201C;Mystifications,&#x201C; and &#x201C;Miss Stirling Graham of Duntrune,&#x201C; both in <hi rend="italic">Horae Subsecivae, Third Series</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>) 115&#x2013;75.</note> whom I could have well dispensed with; for, alas, I am obliged to be very <hi rend="italic">dietetic</hi>, and of all blessings that of being well let alone w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the usefullest for me just now! However, we will manage our very best.</p>
<p>The good Thomas, and all the rest, religiously respect my &#x201C;six hours&#x201C;; and really hitherto I have always got a fair dayswork done. I sit in my big high bedroom (not where <hi rend="italic">we</hi> were, but I think on the opposite, certainly on the west or Dundee side of the house); hear nothing but the <foreign><hi rend="italic">sough</hi></foreign> of woods; have a window flung clean up; go out to smoke at due intervals as at home &#x26;c &#x26;c In fact I am almost too well cared for and attended to. The only evil is that they <hi rend="italic">will</hi> keep me in talk; alas, how much happier c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I be, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> talking or talked to! I require an effort to get my victuals <hi rend="italic">eaten</hi> for talk. And, alas, I am so bilious still;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; that surely <hi rend="italic">must</hi> get away one of these days, if I take proper care.</p>
<p>When Thomas and I got to the shore on Friday afternoon, there clearly was <hi rend="italic">no</hi> bathing possible, nothing but a continent of sand and boulders, little better than Whinny Rigg<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 mi. SE of Annan.</note> long since,&#x2014;so very far out was the tide. Yesterday morning, instead of tumbling about awake, I sallied out, and <hi rend="italic">got</hi> a bathe,&#x2014;a delightful walk thro&#x2019; the early woods to boot;&#x2014;and I shall get some more at other hours on other days.</p>
<p>Dear, there came a maid in about 15 minutes ago; the luncheon-bell (to which I never go) having rung; and the bed and room having been <hi rend="italic">omitted</hi> this morning at breakfast-time. I voluntarily promised to be off &#x201C;for the whole afternoon, in five minutes&#x201C;: so I have had to write as at express-train speed. Anything written will be better than <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to poor Goody. <closer><salute>But now I do go; <pb id="pg-27-185" n="27:185"/>and, with renewed charges to get out of that noise, and take care of thyself,&#x2014;am ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Helps,</salute>
<p>If there were any hope that you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> continue to send me such messages as that printed one to your Imaginary Yankee<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helps wrote &#x201C;A Letter on Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin,&#x201C; <date when="1852-07-09">9 July</date>, in answer to one from Charles Eliot Norton, who had sent him a copy of the novel; see <hi rend="italic">Correspondence of Sir Arthur Helps, K.G.B.</hi>, ed. E. A. Helps (<date when="1917-00-00">1917</date>), which reprints the letter from a pamphlet &#x201C;printed and privately circulated at home and in England and America&#x201C; (112&#x2013;33). In fact, it also appeared in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, 40 (<date when="1852-08-00">August 1852</date>): 237&#x2013;44. Helps&#x2019;s comment is well-argued, basically in agreement with the work saying that it &#x201C;horrifies and haunts me,&#x201C; and that the evil of slavery differed from the way in which the working classes often suffered in Britain. A letter about Helps&#x2019;s article, of <date when="1852-07-28">28 July</date>, JWC to Norton, <date when="1852-07-28">28 July</date>, written from the office of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi>, MS: Houghton Lib., Harvard Univ., is a self-evident forgery.</note> (and a Note to myself in <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi> under the cover) <hi rend="italic">without</hi> response on my part, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be greatly tempted to take your own hint, and answer absolutely nothing: but&#x2014;!&#x2014; The truth is, I got the article in question a week ago at Chelsea; read it more than once,&#x2014;honestly amused by the quiet irony and grave Socratic sense contained in the same;&#x2014;and did intend to say so, that very day; when, behold, a flight to Scotland, per steamer to Dundee, at which I had been shuddering and procrastinating, was suddenly resolved upon (so intense was the heat, so intolerable along with the noise and dust); and accordingly here I am, announcing, at this date instead of that, two small facts instead of one. My voyage was as prosperous as sea-travelling could be: nevertheless I have been in a paroxysm of biliary confusions ever since I set foot on shore, and this is the first day I have been good for anything. How long I am to stay in this county I know not; all I know is, Chelsea, with Morgan&#x2019;s people in it, is a place I had better avoid for some time! For the rest, my wife continues there, or in the neighbourhood, being intent to superintend; and we are both of us entirely contented with the good Morgan.</p>
<p>If I were to get into talking here about big smoky Dundee, and the still beautiful Firth of Tay (where I have bathed twice); about St Andrews Town, the steeples of which are visible here, and seem to invite a visit from me; <pb id="pg-27-186" n="27:186"/>about Scotch humours, fun and piety, and Scotch gentlefolk and simplefolk:&#x2014;all this w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> require several sheets, and alas today in my haste I can scarcely afford one little patch. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Helps: any slightest remembrance from you is always pleasant to my soul; and I rank you, with a kind of royal satisfaction, among the few earnest labourers still known to me on this Planet; and wish you from the heart at all times well.&#x2014; I am to be still a week or 10 days more (&#x201C;Tho<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Erskine Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201C;), after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> two weeks at &#x201C;Scotsbrig, Ecclefechan&#x201C; (my old Mother&#x2019;s); and Chelsea always is an address if you have any further sheets for me</p>

<p><salute>Here is a letter from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Neuberg Dear&#x2014;</salute> No other came for you except the American one I sent&#x2014;from Alick I hoped it was&#x2014; We go on here slowly but surely. <hi rend="italic">Two days</hi> have the two headcarpenters been busy&#x2014;really busy&#x2014;levelling the cross beams in your bedroom&#x2014;&#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan had told them to be most particular in getting the floor <hi rend="italic">level</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; Today they are putting the boards down&#x2014; The Brick-layers are still in the front bedroom envelopping me every half hour down here in clouds of soot! But it will &#x201C;come all to the same ultimately.&#x201C; Now <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are not here to paint out the horrors of every thing so eloquently, I dont care the least in the world about the noise, or the dust, or the tumble heels over head of the whole house&#x2014;all I am concerned about is to get it rapidly on&#x2014;which as Builders and Builders men are at present constituted seems pretty much of an impossibility&#x2014; Yesterday I wrote to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan to take back the third Carpenter and bestow him on somebody with more patience and a less correct eye than myself&#x2014; But it&#x2019;s worse than useless plaguing you in your cool clean retirement there with the worries from which you have just fled away&#x2014; Best you should forget the sound of our hammering altogether&#x2014;so I will henceforth fight my own battle with the house, without saying a word about it&#x2014;</p>
<p>Better news for you is that Lord Ashburton is &#x201C;greatly better&#x2014;quite well since the last attack&#x2014;and gone on to the place in Swizerland&#x201C;&#x2014; Such was the answer to a message of enquiry which I sent to Bath house on Sunday&#x2014;&#x201C;His Lordship had written himself&#x201C; to the large Housemaid&#x2014; So all is right in that direction.</p>

<p>Poor Dalwig is gone away he came on Saturday with Reichenbach to bid me farewell<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Dalwig,&#x2019; grandson of the famed cavalry general of Friedrich the Great, was himself a Prussian officer of horse; from Silesia, where his rank and possessions were ample; as fine, handsome, intelligent, brilliant, and modest a young fellow of his kind as I ever saw. &#x2018;Reichenbach&#x2019; (once Graf von Reichenbach and his neighbour and friend) brought him to us here; where he met Kate Sterling, our late John&#x2019;s second daughter, and one of the brightest of young women. Dalwig, much struck with her, was evidently deliberating great things; and did, before long, apply formally to Captain Anthony Sterling, uncle and guardian, for the &#x2018;great honour and pleasure of making some acquaintance&#x2019; with Kate. To both of us, who knew him, it seemed precisely the offer that might suit beyond all, both for the noble Kate and for her friends, especially her sisters; who were in no society here for making fit matches, but who there, in Silesia, having portions of solid amount, and being all pretty and amiable, need not fail of marrying well if they cared to marry, &#x26;c., &#x26;c.: to all of which we wished cordially well, but kept, and had kept, strictly silent except to one another. Abrupt Captain Anthony, now growing elderly, and very abrupt and perverse, was not slow in answering, as if to &#x2018;a beggarly foreigner,&#x2019; his emphatic No! To which Dalwig, like a man of honour, at once bowed. Bright Kate testified all along a maidenly indifference, maidenly nescience, but was not thought to have an averse feeling. &#x2026; T.C.&#x201C; (Note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>). Georg Ludwig Dalwig (<date when="1725-00-00">1725</date>&#x2013;<date when="1796-00-00">96</date>), Prussian cavalry gen.; his grandson not further identified.</note>&#x2014; I gave him the Copy of the <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi> I <hi rend="small-caps">extorted</hi> from you for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newton, who never got it&#x2014;not in memory of Kate I told him but of myself; and he blushed and kissed my hand and went away rather sad, but with as manly and dashing a bearing as if Kate had been ever so kind&#x2014;I dont believe the girl will ever have such another chance in her whole Life!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Poor, ardent, enthusiastic, high-minded Kate! she used to ride with me sometimes in those years; she was to the last passionately the friend and adorer of my Jane; perhaps there hardly was in England a brighter young creature; and her fate was cruel&#x2014;this of Dalwig, the turning-point, I rather think! Being forbidden our house (abrupt Captain Anthony being in some tiff of his own here), she frequented &#x2018;uncle <supplied>[F. D.]</supplied> Maurice&#x2019;s,&#x2019; where no foreigners frequented, but only young &#x2018;unsound&#x2019; divines much did.

<salute>My dear John</salute>
<p>You will like to hear &#x201C;what I am thinking of Life&#x201C; in the present confusion. Well then; I am not <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi> of it at all but <hi rend="italic">living it</hi> very contentedly. The tumult has been even greater since M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C went than it was before; for new floors are being put down in the top story and the noise of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is something terrific. But now that I feel the noise and dirt and discord with my own senses only and not thro <hi rend="italic">his</hi> as well, it is amazing how little I care about it. Nay in superintending all these men I begin to find myself in the career open to my particular talents,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

The first night; I came upon her listening at the door, and the next morning, I came upon her reading one of my letters! and in every little box drawer and corner I found <hi rend="italic">traces</hi> of her prying&#x2014; It was going to be like living under an Austrian Spy, then because she had no regular work possible to do, she did nothing of her own accord that was required&#x2014; Little Martha who was here in Anne&#x2019;s illness, and whom I had taken back for a week or two, was worth a dozen of her in serviceableness, the little cooking <hi rend="italic">I</hi> needed, was always &#x201C;what she hadnt been used to where she lived before&#x201C; and for that or some other reason detestable&#x2014; I saw before the first week was <pb id="pg-27-190" n="27:190"/>out that I had got, a helpless, illtrained, low minded goose, and this morning the last day of the week I was wishing to Heaven I had brought no regular Servant into the house at all just now, but gone on with little Martha.&#x2014; As there was not work enough for <hi rend="italic">half a one</hi> never to speak of two, I had told little Martha she must go home tonight&#x2014;I would rather have sent away the other, but she had waited three weeks for the place and couldn&#x2019;t be despatched without a months warning, and besides I felt hardly justified in giving her no longer trial.

By the strangest chance Irish Fanny who has always kept on coming to see me from time to time and is now in better health, arrived at teatime to tell me she had left her place&#x2014; I offered her mine which she had already made trial of and she accepted with an enthusiasm that did ones heart good after all those cold ungrateful English wretches&#x2014; I stipulated however that she should not come for a month.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Along with the Newspapers, I will send you a word of writing, to keep your good heart in peace, and prevent sinister imaginations about me. I got John&#x2019;s second Note this morning;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated Scotsbrig, <date when="1852-07-27">27 July</date>.</note> and bid you give him many thanks from me for both of them: he sends me good accounts of you and of Scotsbrig generally;&#x2014;and I hope it will not be long till I hear the like from him again.</p>
<p>I am beautifully lodged here: a great large house with few people in it; they have given me a big bedroom (directly over Mr Erskine&#x2019;s sitting-room, which John of course recollects); it looks towards the northwest, out upon the grass and trees, here I sit all forenoon in great privacy over my Books; here I sleep all night with open window: it is one of the most silent, fresh and eligible places I have ever lodged in. The weather also is really quite excellent: the heat of it is never in the least oppressive here, one can run out under the shade of thick trees with any book one is reading, and there is always some breath of air astir. No better weather could be wished; and indeed it seems to have all along been good, and to be doing the <hi rend="italic">work</hi> of good weather: for there is such a crop as I have seldom seen (such <hi rend="italic">wheat</hi> far surpasses what they shew in the South, as far as I have noticed), and it is rapidly coming towards ripeness, in another fortnight all will be <hi rend="italic">white.</hi> The only drawback, in this matter of crop, is that the <hi rend="italic">Potatoe-disease</hi> has again decidedly made its appearance, they say, in a very vigorous form; so what is to become of that unfortunate root must be considered quite uncertain again.&#x2014; &#x2014; If to all this we add the unaffected kindness of my good hosts, you will understand that in point of being &#x201C;lodged&#x201C; there are few of her Majesty&#x2019;s subjects so well off as I! I have nevertheless had a great tumult of biliary confusions ever since I landed,&#x2014;the voyage, quiet as it was, having tumbled me quite topsy-turvy;&#x2014;but I am slowly, every day, getting a little cleared into composure out of all that, and doubtless so soon as I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> out of it, I shall feel improved by these biliary revolutions. I have bathed twice in the Sea water, which was very excellent both times, but does not quite suit my hours,&#x2014;for one <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a little dependent on the state of the tide here, and when that is very low, there is but a stony confused receptacle offered to the adventurous bather, which I did not think of venturing into. Thomas E. takes me down, however, almost daily to the cool seabeach, and then walks me on the hard damp sand (for which I have <hi rend="italic">gutta-percha</hi>), amid incessant talking, almost farther than my present <pb id="pg-27-192" n="27:192"/>biliary condition will comport.&#x2014; We are happily very quiet, hardly more than 3 in number since the day after I came; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is greatly to my mind: but there are others coming tomorrow, again others; one cannot hope to have the <foreign><hi rend="italic">gang</hi></foreign> always to oneself! I shall do my ten days, there is good likelihood, with comfortable success.&#x2014;Yesterday I had a letter from Jane; who professes to be well, but is getting little sleep, poor thing. She is going into the country in the end of this week (to see poor Mrs Macready who is hopelessly ill): that will be slight interval to the noise.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Blessings on you Dear Mother. Love to all. Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name></p>
<ps><p>Writing, especially at this low table, always give me a headache; so I cease, and carry my Bout<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, for &#x201C;Book.&#x201C;</note> <hi rend="italic">out</hi> under the shadow of a big tree,&#x2014;where I have tobacco too!</p></ps>

<p><salute>Dear little <foreign>Bairn</foreign>,</salute> you are on the road to Sherburne today; sweeping prosperously, I hope, thro&#x2019; green and yellow fields under the pure summer sky: and I will send you a word of remembrance to reach you there before you leave again. Your Letter came duly yesterday morning,&#x2014;the Newspapers the <hi rend="italic">evening</hi> before (there being an incidental messenger at the Post-Office that evening);&#x2014;I meant to write yesterday, but about noon there came other arrangements from without in upon me, and I reflected that today would answer equally well.</p>
<p>You say nothing about your <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> this time; which does not, unluckily, permit me to infer a quite favourable state of matters on that side; all the less, as you suddenly take up a resolution to tell me <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> of all the subsequent tumults which the carpenters &#x26;c may occasion in your domestic establish<hi rend="italic">t!</hi> This is a very rash and unsound resolution, I do perceive; and my express instruction is, that you do faithfully send me account of all things: you need not fear their being too oppressive here; the contrary, with one&#x2019;s imagination busy, is what would be truly oppressive.&#x2014; Above all things, if you could get any light from Morgan and from your own experience combined with him, as to the grand question, About what time he actually <hi rend="italic">will</hi> (if he prosper) be about preparing to evacuate our poor premises? The &#x201C;six weeks&#x201C; he talked of are nearly gone already, and belong <supplied>[to]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> the realm of youthful fables. A <pb id="pg-27-193" n="27:193"/>practical answer in prosaic approximate fact is very needful for us, however. We cannot know how to arrange our motions at all till that is in some measure known. For example, my &#x201C;ten days,&#x201C;&#x2014;which I must not extend very much, for fear of trespass on the invisible sacred fences,&#x2014;are fast running to an end; will be fairly over when you return: in Annandale, with John there, I evidently cannot long hold out, or even try to hold out: for the Ferguses &#x26;c I feel not the slightest capability in my present humour: What then will the bare hand do? It seems to me Morgan&#x2019;s answer will much determine what motives there are for the German journey. Travelling, of all kinds, grows more and more horrible to me; nor do I yet quite see that there lies in <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>k alone sufficient motive to lead me into such a set of sufferings and expenses; but if the thing c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be so settled that, since we <hi rend="italic">must</hi> travel somewhere, a travel to Germany might immediately follow this Scotch one (say three weeks hence, not later), that might evidently be a grand consideration in determining the business. Or on the other hand, shall we cower into some hole, the nearest best, and give up Germany to the winds. I am very weary of all locomotion, of all jargon-talk with my indifferent brethren of mankind: &#x201C;she said, I am aweary! I&#x2019;m very very weary,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tennyson, &#x201C;Mariana.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;truly so could I say;&#x2014;and Neuberg&#x2019;s curtainless beds, with the Rankes, Varnhagens and other gabbling creatures one will meet there, are not very inviting!&#x2014; Question Morgan, however, and still more your own <hi rend="italic">prophetic</hi> gift of human intelligence; at <supplied>[least]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> let us see a little what our capabilities are.</p>
<p>It is now a week since I came hither; and the <hi rend="italic">b<supplied>[i]</supplied>lious</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> turmoils are only now beginning to subside, and a kind of new regularity to supervene; tho&#x2019; the circumstances surely have been altogether favourable. Better weather never came from the sky; kinder landlords (tho&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">wearisome</hi> is in permanence here, I think), nor better lodging, no man need wish. Yet so it is. Only by dint of spending my day almost all <foreign><hi rend="italic">sub dio</hi></foreign> [under the heavens], most part of it in solitude, and with other good precautions, have I managed so far. These last 2 nights are the first in which I have got into tolerable sleeping &#x26;c: and in general if I am quiet, we cannot yet boast much of our &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">joyous</hi> existence&#x201C; in these parts!&#x2014; The fact is, there have come certain Oliphants (Indian Major with wife and boy); a sister of Sir D. Dundas, and other incidentals;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Major James Oliphant (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>), retired from Indian army as major, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>, director of E India Co., <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>, chairman, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>.

But we ought to be thankful too;&#x2014;and are, in fact, a grumbling bad man, after a sort.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-194" n="27:194"/>Let me not forget to say that your little Deptford mission, so soon as I shewed it to Thomas, was cheerfully undertaken by him; and a letter was straightway sent off to Admiral Stuart (?), not by Erskine himself, but by one of these people (the Dundas, I think, a Widow &#x201C;Robertson,&#x201C; or the big Oliphant, an Indian Director) who knows the Admiral better than E. does. As I could give them no account of Dodd (?), and yet had charged them to send his letter back to you,&#x2014;they <hi rend="italic">inclosed</hi> the said Dodd letter in an open cover with your Address, then the Admiral may study <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, along with all the testimony I could give; and after that, he will doubtless seal it, send it to the Post-Office, and so restore it with at least symbolical response.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520727-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1852-07-27">27 July</date>]</ref>.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here is a small word for Scotsbrig and you, merely to wind up the week, for there has nothing new happened since I wrote to my Mother.</p>
<p>Your Note, refusing E.&#x2019;s kind invitation, came duly the day after I had written: it was received with due regret by the good Thomas; nevertheless I thought you had made a wise arrangement of the matter, and that it was all <hi rend="italic">best</hi> as you had left it. We shall meet soon, we two, if all go well; and at Scotsbrig there will be much freer field for us than any effort of hospitality could here provide.</p>
<p>I had a Letter from Jane the day before yesterday: all was in the old progressive revolutionary state in Cheyne Row,&#x2014;a fearfully <hi rend="italic">distant</hi> date becoming surmiseable for the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of all that:&#x2014;Jane had not yet fled to Park Street; but as the <hi rend="italic">floor</hi> of my room was up, I fancy she will now soon have to do so. Meanwhile, yesterday (Friday) she was to go to Sherburne in Dorsetshire, till the Monday following; for the purpose of visiting poor Mrs Macready; a sad visit as the good Mrs M. is in a very bad way of health, and indeed understood, by herself and friends, to be swiftly sinking towards death. Poor thing, she was one of the most affectionate innocent-hearted clear beings we knew in all our circle. Jane wished to go; and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> likewise much wished it. Poor M&#x2019;C. will be very lonely when this faithful partner leaves him in his old days.</p>
<p>We have had a considerable party here for the last 3 days; Indian Major Oliphants, Mrs Robertson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Robertson, see preceding letter.</note> &#x26;c: who happily are all gone, and have left us quiet again, about half an hour ago. Nothing but queer old antediluvian Scotch German, &#x201C;a Miss Porteous from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Miss Porteous, possibly of 13 Leopold Place.</note> with a hollow low voice (not heard above once or twice in the day), anxious would-be earnest gray eyes, and lips thrown out like a coach-horn when she does speak a sound: an interesting anti-diluvian specimen, who gives no trouble at all.</p>
<p>On Thursday Erskine and I had settled on a trip to St. Andrews; and two male Oliphants, harmless healthy animals, accompanied us in the adventure. St. Andrews is all changed; new-paved, veneered over with white ashlar; full of a bathing and gallivanting population,&#x2014;of Bell&#x2019;s Madras Schools (1000 scholars, the &#x201C;examination&#x201C; just going on that day), and of quite modern <hi rend="italic">un</hi>academic Berlin-wool shops, omnibuses and distractions. We saw the Ruins, the Colleges, the Library; saw a Professor Alexander (very deaf and dull but very good otherwise), called on Brewster whom happily we did not <pb id="pg-27-197" n="27:197"/>find;&#x2014;tell my Mother, I saw Haliburton&#x2019;s grave and Samuel Rutherfords,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Halyburton (<date when="1674-00-00">1674</date>&#x2013;<date when="1712-00-00">1712</date>), theologian, professor of divinity, New College, St. Andrews, <date when="1710-00-00">1710</date>&#x2013;<date when="1712-00-00">12</date>; and Samuel Rutherford (<date when="1600-00-00">1600</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1661-00-00">1661</date>), covenanter; prof. of divinity, <date when="1639-00-00">1639</date>, then principal, <date when="1649-00-00">1649</date>, of St. Mary&#x2019;s College, St. Andrews; rector of St. Andrews univ., <date when="1651-00-00">1651</date>; commissioner of Church of Scotland to Westminster Assembly, <date when="1643-00-00">1643</date>&#x2013;<date when="1647-00-00">47</date>.</note> two ancient headstones with long inscriptions, which are kept clear and in a safe <hi rend="italic">painted</hi> state beside the old Cathedral:&#x2014;finally at 5 o&#x2019;clock we reimbarked in our railway; and got safe home, well enough content, and in tolerable time for dinner. I have no more expeditions that I know; nothing but a walk daily to the seashore for bathing (especially while the tides continue good), and all the morning to myself and my books.</p>
<p>Nothing yet is hinted about departure; but of course my ten days are nearly done, and we must not forget dates. Do you remember Gordon&#x2019;s address?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Gordon.</note> I do not mean to stay above a few hours in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, but would see <hi rend="italic">him</hi> if he is there.&#x2014; Tell me specifically what is going on at Scotsbrig; and above all how my Mother is.</p>
<p>Shearing, they say, has begun in the Carse of Gowrie;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Perthshire, a stretch of fertile land along the river Tay.</note> and all hereabouts it will start next week: one of the best crops ever seen.&#x2014;<closer><salute>Give my love to my Mother and them all. Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Penelope</salute>
<p>I went to the Library today to seek your book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The London Lib. had 5 vol., 2nd edn., Johann Lorenz von Mosheim, <hi rend="italic">An Ecclesiastical History, Ancient and Modern, from the Birth of Christ, to the Beginning of the Present Century</hi>, trans. by Archibald Maclaine (<date when="1768-00-00">1768</date>).</note> and it is there&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">five</hi> great volumes of it which having no carriage I dreaded to bring away with me&#x2014; I thought, as you said it was to look up some particular thing you could perhaps tell me which volume you wanted&#x2014;or could perhaps go to the Library yourself and use my name&#x2014;to get a sight of all the volumes&#x2014;If nothing will satisfy but to have the whole five at your house you shall have them.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1852-07-31">31 July</date> from Moffat.</note> this morning, no sooner (for we seldom send at <hi rend="italic">night</hi> to Broughty), such is the time a Letter takes. On returning from Moffat, you will find a Note from me; and so can answer this and it at once.&#x2014; I have not the least news; only that I continue well, and indeed am daily getting clearer of all the <hi rend="italic">biliary</hi> confusions my journey had bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> upon me.&#x2014;Jane will be returning this day from Sherburne, a rather melancholy journey; I shall probably not hear from her till Wednesday at soonest.</p>
<p>My &#x201C;studies&#x201C; here amount, alas, to a nearly imaginary quantity: but I am religiously let alone till about 3 p.m. every day; and that is a real blessing to me. I do read German Books, but also frequently <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi>, and my thoughts go wandering far enough from study.&#x2014; Tomorrow we have to go and dine with Miss Stirling Graham (a collateral of &#x201C;Cursed Clavers,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Graham of Claverhouse (<date when="1649-00-00">1649</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1689-00-00">89</date>), 1st Viscount Dundee, Scottish royalist and Jacobite, known as Bloody Clavers or Bonny Dundee.</note> and a very clever little stout dame, if you know her); I hope this will be my only feat in that line on the present occasion.</p>
<p>Does my poor Mother often lie in bed in these warm days? Alas, alas, the thought of it makes me sad,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; probably it is all as it should be, and not a matter for sorrow chiefly.&#x2014; &#x2014; Tell me a little what are the <hi rend="italic">Lodging</hi> capabilities of Scotsbrig at this time? I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> stay 10 days with you: but of course 3 w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> suffice for any errand I have. My time is nearly out here; and tho&#x2019; they want me to continue, I fear it is only to the good Thomas that I am a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> convenience: not to say that one should endeavour to <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> one&#x2019;s term when a term was set: some day or other, this week, I believe I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be off. This afternoon, moreover, &#x201C;the Patersons&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine&#x2019;s sister David Paterson and her husband.</note> are returning from London, Mrs Paterson in very weak health; which of course is another monition that &#x201C;important strangers&#x201C; (for they do bother themselves too much about me) ought to be mindful of their duty. Add to all which, the two man-servants are off this morning,&#x2014;gone to California, the fools; a new set is coming not yet come!</p>
<p>There are a Lord and Lady Airly that wanted me to come and see their place,&#x2014;Cortachy, Kirriemuir;&#x2014;but they are young not very wise people; their place is 25 miles off; and I cannot think of turning in that direction. I calculate rather on getting home all at a stretch on the day I leave this,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I should like a glance (and only one) of the Ferguses and Gordon as I pass. To both of whom I have written accordingly today. Gordon I have addressed <pb id="pg-27-199" n="27:199"/>&#x201C;University Chambers&#x201C; (which I suppose will at last find him): it strikes me as likeliest he is not in town at all; and this probably is &#x201C;just as well.&#x201C; In fact I am really still in doubt whether to send on the two notes, or to suppress them, and ride silently past these old friends! But that is mere cowardice too, and the fruit of lively humours, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> ought not to be too far followed.</p>
<p>Poor Helen Welsh does not seem to be in a good way,&#x2014;poor good soul, I am truly sorry for her! That Philp, if I recollect him rightly, is a sensible kind of fellow.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote: &#x201C;I enclose a note from the Kirkcaldy doctor about Miss Welsh, she is not getting on very promisingly.&#x201C;</note></p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Brookfield</salute>
<p>Your note being without date (Ah! and you a <hi rend="italic">man!</hi>) I can&#x2019;t know precisely how long it has lain here; but I have only just found it on my return from Sherborne&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has been in Scotland for nearly a fortnight, fled from the Bricklayers and Carpenters whom himself so rashly evoked <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am doing what England expects of me!&#x2014;presiding over the earthquake here; except for a short visit to poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Macready.</p>
<p>I do not <hi rend="italic">usually</hi> accept invitations on <hi rend="italic">my own basis</hi>, for example I have just declined an invitation to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle from the Directors of the Chrystal Palace (!) to a breakfast on the new founding!!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Since the Great Exhibition closed, <date when="1851-10-00">Oct. 1851</date>, there had been discussion in press and Parliament about whether to keep the building in Hyde Park. It was decided to dismantle it as first planned. The Crystal Palace Co. was formed, which purchased the building for &#xa3;70,000 and began moving it to Sydenham, 6 mi. S of London Bridge. The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> reported, <date when="1852-08-07">7 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;On Thursday morning last [<date when="1852-08-05">5 Aug.</date>] the first column &#x2026; was erected &#x2026; accompanied by more than the usual amount of enthusiasm. The upper part of the ground was covered with tents,&#x2014;and the space to be &#x2026; crowned by the transept was railed off by cords very appropriately and picturesquely connected with a series of flag-staffs bearing the banners of all nations. The crowds of well-dressed persons, the interest evidently felt, and the fine weather, all tended to recall the days connected with the Crystal House in Hyde Park.&#x201C; It opened <date when="1854-06-10">10 June 1854</date> and was a popular resort until destroyed by fire, <date when="1936-11-30">30 Nov. 1936</date>.</note> (very much <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would <pb id="pg-27-200" n="27:200"/><supplied>[have]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> liked <hi rend="italic">that</hi> surely!)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> (<date when="1852-08-06">6 Aug.</date>) listed Carlyle among many who wrote &#x201C;excusing&#x201C; their absence.</note> but as I have <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> faith in your liking me a little as a humanbeing&#x2014;and not merely as the wife of &#x201C;a clever but fantastical Writer&#x201C; I will if you like go to you by myself on Friday&#x2014;</p>
<p>Meanwhile it would give you a new idea of Chaos&#x2014;just to come and cast your eyes over this house&#x2014;</p>

<p>And now you must consider and decide&#x2014; For two months I am pretty sure there will be no living for you here&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> can do quite well&#x2014;and seem to be <hi rend="italic">extremely</hi> necessary for shifting about the things and looking after the men&#x2014; The only servant in the House is little Martha&#x2014; Our Beauty was as perfect a fool as the sun ever shone on, and at the end of a week <hi rend="italic">left</hi>, finding it &#x201C;quite impossible to live in any such muddle&#x201C;&#x2014; I have been doing very well with Martha for the last week&#x2014;and Irish Fanny is engaged to come on the 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x2014;but I did not want a regular servant at present&#x2014;</p>
<p>My idea is that you ought to go to Germany <hi rend="italic">by yourself</hi>&#x2014;leaving me here, where I am more useful at present than I could be anywhere else&#x2014;but if you dont like <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, there will be the <hi rend="italic">Grange</hi> open for <date when="1852-09-00">September</date>, and you could go by yourself <hi rend="italic">there</hi> As to &#x201C;cowering into some hole&#x201C;! you are &#x201C;the last man in all England&#x201C; that can do that sort of thing with advantage so there&#x2019;s no use speculating about it&#x2014;</p>
<p>If you could make up your mind to Germany any easier for my going to see to the beds &#x26;c, of course there is no such <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> need of my staying here, that I could not delegate my superintendence to Chalmers<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chalmers at no. 4.</note> or somebody, and put Fanny into the kitchen and go away&#x2014;but I shant take it the least unkind your leaving me behind, and with Neuberg to attend on you I really think you would be better without me&#x2014; You are always wishing to get away from me, and when you have a fair pretext you dont embrace it&#x2014; I wish I hadnt been required to say all this business sort of thing&#x2014;I could have written you a letter really pleasant to read out of the materials collected in my Sherborne visit&#x2014; <pb id="pg-27-202" n="27:202"/>Nay If I am left quiet this evening perhaps, now that this disagreeable prose is off my hands I may still write my travels</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Airlie,</salute>
<p>I am at present within some 20 or 30 miles, as I understand, of Cortachy Castle; and I cannot turn my face south again without waving you a gentle farewell. I have entertained pious wishes; and inquired as to distances and capabilities; but it seems to be intimated you are at some place named &#x201C;Garscube,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >5 mi. NW of Glasgow.</note> in the unknown distance, in these days; and, at any rate, unless I had the wings of an eagle or dove (which I clearly have not) there could be no likelihood of so sluggish a terrestrial body&#x2019;s moving itself by rail or gig across the mountains in weather such as this! I have remained perfectly stationary ever since I came hither; never once even in Dundee; bathing daily in the German Ocean; and speaking no word (in general) till towards evening,&#x2014;favoured as I am. Rest, and silence under these blessed skies,&#x2014;no paradise (after the Baker&#x2019;s-oven of London) could so suit a poor man!</p>
<p>My Wife still remains there, superintending much architecture, and internal improvement (of her own contriving) at Chelsea: I go now to Annandale for ten days (probably on Friday first);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1852-08-06">6 Aug.</date></note> after which there is still talk of some possibility of a German voyage for us;&#x2014;but that, I confess has grown very vague, and looks now almost as like an <hi rend="italic">im</hi>possibility.</p>
<p>Inquiry was made of me, whether Mrs Milnes had yet achieved anything noteworthy in British History;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had given birth to a da., Amicia, <date when="1852-08-03">3 Aug.</date></note> but I could give no answer. I have heard of nobody since the beginning of this month.</p>
<p>The other day, at Broughty-Ferry, Mr Erskine spoke with a gentleman who, he told me, was &#x201C;Lord Airlie&#x2019;s Uncle&#x201C;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Donald Ogilvy (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>) of Clova, Forfarshire, or William Ogilvy of Logal, Perthshire.</note> the sight of whom brought various figures vividly into my mind. <closer><salute>I send many kind regards to his Lordship, and with all manner of wishes and remembrances, bid the fair Countess Blanche paternally <foreign>adieu</foreign> for this time.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>I ought, in spite of my indolence and and<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> other obstructions, to send you a single word by way of news; the rather as you know that I am here, and do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> know how I get on, and what I am next bound for.&#x2014; I had the beautifullest steam-voyage in the finest weather: nevertheless it seems to tumble me all to topsy-turvy, and I was in a truly bilious and altogether revolutionary condition for the first week. However, I have now got out of that; and feel really very kindly toward my rural solitude here, and doubt not I am really improved by it. Nothing can be more hospitable good and pious than the excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> people here; they leave me every day in strict <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> till towards 3 p.m. (under the name of &#x201C;studying,&#x201C; tho&#x2019; I don&#x2019;t study much); then I bathe almost daily in the clear sea water;&#x2014;and have in short a more than usually fair chance to be content and make improvement.</p>
<p>Jane continues at or about Chelsea, superintending her workers; on Monday last (day before yesterday) she was to return from a little excursion into Dorsetshire (a good way south-west of London): I did not hear of her this morning, but hope I shall tomorrow.&#x2014;Jack&#x2019;s letter of this morning I inclose; which will shew you a little whereabouts we are.</p>
<p>I could be well content to stay many months or all the year round in such quiet quarters: however, my time is now fairly run; and conscience admonishes my indolence that we ought to keep time! &#x201C;Friday or so&#x201C; is the day I have vaguely stated for turning Southward,&#x2014;not long after <hi rend="italic">which</hi>, it may be hoped, you will hear of me or see me. <closer><salute>With kind remembrances to James,&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Note finds its way to me here; the <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> remains unluckily, confined to the limits of Chelsea. I have been from home these two weeks; and have not any prospect of being fixed in any place again for at least a couple of months to come.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances I believe your only plan will be, to call at Cheyne <pb id="pg-27-204" n="27:204"/>Row, and get your <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> back, which I have instructed them to deliver you on demand. You will at least avoid damage in this way; and unluckily there is no prospect of advantage, anywhere in this operation, worth running a risk for.</p>
<p>I should have much regretted being from home, when you applied, had there been any considerable chance of helping you by examination of this <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> But indeed I must confess to myself such is not the case. I never could deliberately judge of <hi rend="italic">Mss.</hi>, not being able even to read them with any composure. And what is my judgement worth? You want a Publisher&#x2019;s judgement; and with such I have no influence or concern at all.&#x2014; The rule is, if your own mind feel strongly urged to speak this thing, then speak it the best you can;&#x2014;and observe always, there is one canon of composition which includes all others, use as few words (and as few thoughts too) <hi rend="italic">as possible. Brevity</hi> (in conception and expression, especially in the <hi rend="italic">former</hi>) is verily the soul of wit.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 2.2.</note>&#x2014; Which seems to point rather towards the shaping of your ideas into a Magazine Article than a special volume?</p>
<p>If you adopt that former method, here is a card that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> introduce you to Parker (<hi rend="italic">West</hi> Strand; observe, for there are two)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. W. Parker, 445 West Strand, and John Henry Parker, 377 The Strand.</note> who publishes <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine;</hi> but I confess I do not hope much from it otherwise. However, he is one of the best Booksellers, and really a candid intelligent man.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your new Note; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I received yesterday, and read with satisfaction. I have written to warn the Ferguses of my Advent, have had due response from Miss Jessy; and here it is settled that I am fairly <hi rend="italic">to be off tomorrow</hi> (Friday, 6<hi rend="italic">th</hi>,&#x2014;I think by a train that leaves Broughty about 1 p.m.). I will stay with the Ferguses (according to bargain) all night: on Saturday morning I am ready for the Caledonian,&#x2014;if I only understood what train w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the <hi rend="italic">best</hi>, or indeed the possible one! I have no <hi rend="italic">Bradshaw</hi> here, nothing but the <hi rend="italic">Fife</hi> railway Book; and from this I gather merely that the <hi rend="italic">mail</hi> train leaves Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> towards Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> at 10:40 a.m. This will be too early for a comfortable start: but then what help is there? There <hi rend="italic">used</hi> to be a train at 4 p.m. by which I once came comfortably enough: perhaps it will be better to depend on that?</p>
<p>On the whole, I will try to write to you tomorrow ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> from Kirkcaldy, <pb id="pg-27-205" n="27:205"/>where there will be clearer tidings procurable: you may still get my Note in time, I think;&#x2014;no, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in time for the <hi rend="italic">mail</hi> train! Alas, and I find the railway table at the end of this Fife Book is perhaps not the <hi rend="italic">Caledonian</hi> at all, but the Newcastle and London! What is to be done?</p>
<p>Let me settle to come by the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> train that starts <hi rend="italic">after noon:</hi> that will direct you with the gig. First train that leaves Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> after 12, if you hear <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> more. <closer><salute>And so <foreign>adieu</foreign></salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer> 	<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Farie is here these two days; and we are all in a hurlyburly, going to Arbroath<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >17 mi. NE of Dundee.</note> &#x26;c. Mrs Paterson &#x26; suite has come; very weakly she, but seemingly free of sickness. I heard from Jane this morning; she is well, but the <hi rend="italic">house</hi> is a mere hurlyburly, and like to continue so</p></ps>

<p><salute>Thanks poor little soul.</salute> I looked confidently for a Letter today, and you have sent one full of news, and with promise of more perhaps for tomorrow,&#x2014;which <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> may it become a certainty!</p>
<p>Meanwhile here we have got such a picture of absolute chaos in Cheyne Row as ought to satisfy the most craving appetite; and I perceive your prediction of 2 months (frightful to the soul!) is perfectly likely to be conformable to fact. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu!</hi></foreign> What shall be decided on?

However, there is not a word possible on that subject at present, not sooner than tomorrow if even that. Sufficient for this day to say, That my term is now come here; that I am to go off southward <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi> (Friday at 1 p.m.); that I <hi rend="italic">night</hi> in Fergusdom; and then <hi rend="italic">next</hi> day home to Annandale!</p>
<p>For the rest, I am quite well, indeed getting better daily for the last week;&#x2014;but here at present is such a <hi rend="italic">hurry</hi> for want of absolute time that not one word more can be written even to the best Goody I have ever seen in the world.</p>

<p>You recollect Dear that Macready told me<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1852-07-20">20 July</date>.</note> of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> routes; recommending that by Frome as the quickest and least fatiguing: so I rendered myself at the Paddington Station on Friday morning, with my night things in a bag on one arm, and my &#x201C;Blessed&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Dog Nero&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> in a basket on the other. <hi rend="small-caps">he</hi> gave me no trouble&#x2014;kept himself hidden and motionless till the train started, and then looked out cautiously, as much as to say &#x201C;are we safe?&#x201C; The journey to Frome was quite a <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> after that mornings work&#x2014;(carrying down all the books from the top landing place into the back parlour)! And I descended from the train quite fresh for the thirty miles by coach&#x2014; But when I inquired about the coach to Sherborne I was told there was none!! a coach passing thro&#x2019; Sherborne, passed thro Frome, without coming to the Station, at eleven in the morning&#x2014;three hours <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the time we were at! no other since many months back! My first thought was; what a mercy <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were not with me! my next, that the Macreadys could not blame <hi rend="italic">me</hi> for keeping them waiting&#x2014;and then I &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">considered</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;like the piper&#x2019;s cow<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the verses &#x201C;The Tune the Old Cow Died Of&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340815-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:269</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-08-15">15 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">resolved</hi>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> to stay all day and night at Frome, but to take a Yeovil coach which started at five, which could take me, I was told, to a way-side Inn within eight miles of Sherborne, and there I hoped to find a fly&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">or something</hi>&#x201C;! Meanwhile I would proceed to the town of Frome, a mile from the station, and get something to eat and even to drink; &#x201C;feeling it my duty&#x201C; to keep my heart up by all needful appliances. I left my little bag at the Station where the coach came, and set my dog quite free, and we pursued our way as calmly and naturally as if we had known where we were going.

Probably Sir David Milne (<date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18783"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), retired admiral; knighted, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>; after active service, M.P. for Berwick, <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>, vice-adm., <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>, adm., <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, and commander-in-chief at Plymouth, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>.

But for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> reflection I could almost have laughed at my forlorn position there. The Inn and Town were &#x201C;so disagreeable&#x201C; that I went presently back to the station prefering to wait <hi rend="italic">there.</hi> One of the men who had informed me about the coach came to me as I was sitting on a bench and remarked on the beauty of the scene, especially of some scarlet beans that were growing in <hi rend="italic">his own</hi> piece of garden&#x2014;&#x2018;Ah&#x2019;! he said &#x201C;I have lived in London and I have lived abroad&#x2014;I have been here and there, backwards and forwards, while I was in service, <hi rend="italic">with them as never could rest;</hi> but Im satisfied now, that the only contentment for Man is in growing his own <hi rend="small-caps">vegetable</hi>&#x201C;! &#x201C;Look at them beans&#x201C; he said again&#x2014;&#x201C;Well! tomorrow they&#x2019;ll be ready and I&#x2019;ll be pulling them, and boiling them, and&#x2014;eating them! and <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a taste! No agriculture like <hi rend="italic">that</hi> in Piccadilly!&#x201C; Then he looked sympathisyingly at <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and said&#x2014;&#x201C;Im going to get you something you&#x2019;ll like&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s a glass of cool, fresh, clear water!&#x2014;and he went away with a jug to his garden and fetched some water from a little spring well&#x2014;and a great handful of mignionette&#x2014;&#x201C;There! there&#x2019;s something sweet for you, and here&#x2019;s splendid water!&#x2014;that you wont find the like of in Piccadilly.&#x201C; I asked him how it was going with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Bennet? &#x201C;Huh! I hear no complaints! but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> goes to neither one nor other of them and follows my own notions! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> finds agriculture the thing!&#x201C; He would have been worth a hundred pounds to Dickens that man! I had <hi rend="italic">the coach</hi> all to myself for a while, then a young gentleman got in who did exactly the right thing by me, neither spoke to me nor looked at me&#x2014;till we stopt at Castle Carry (<hi rend="italic">Yeovil</hi> pronounced Youghel?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Castle Carry?</hi> I grew quite frightened that I had been somehow transported into Ireland!)<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Castle Cary is 14&#xBD; mi. from Frome. JWC alludes to Castle Cahir (pronounced &#x201C;Care&#x201C;) in Tipperary, captured by Cromwell in <date when="1649-00-00">1649</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:140.</note> There the Young Gentleman went into the Inn and said to me first, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Excuse the liberty I take in asking;</hi> but&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">would</hi> you take anything&#x2014;a little wine and water&#x201C;? I thought <hi rend="italic">that</hi> very <hi rend="italic">polite;</hi> but I was to meet with &#x201C;something more exquisite still&#x201C; before I got to Sherborne. At the Sparkford Inn&#x2014;eight miles from Sherborne&#x2014;I got out and 
<pb id="pg-27-208" n="27:208"/>asked had they a <hi rend="italic">fly</hi>&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Yes!</hi> but one of its wheels was broken and it was gone to be mended&#x201C;! Had they any other conveyance that was <hi rend="italic">whole</hi>&#x2014;a gig, or cart? &#x201C;Yes they had a nice little gig and I should have the loan of a cloak to keep me warm&#x201C;&#x2014;(the evening was rather chill)&#x2014; So I went in&#x2014;and sat down in a parlour where an old gentleman was finishing off with cheese and bread. He soon made himself master of my case, and regretted he was not going back to Sherborne that night, as then he would have taken me in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> carriage&#x2014;and presently he offered something else more practical, viz: to try to recover my parasol (my Mother&#x2019;s, the one she bought with the Soverign you gave her,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A sovereign to each of them, on returning home with a pocketful from my &#x2018;first lecture.&#x2019; Ah, me!&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> and which I had got new covered) left stupidly in the roof of the coach, and never recollected till the coach with its four horses had thundered past the window! If the Landlord would tell the coachman about it next day, and get it there, he, the old Gentleman, would bring it to Sherborne House. I went into the Lobby to tell the Landlady, some five or eight minutes after the coach had started, and told her in presence of a gentleman who was preparing to start in a <hi rend="italic">ba<supplied>[r]</supplied>ouchette</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> with two horses&#x2014;He looked at me, but said nothing&#x2014;and a minute or two after I saw <hi rend="italic">him</hi> also drive past the window. Some twenty minutes after; I started myself, in a little gig, with a brisk little horse, and silent driver&#x2014; Nothing could be more pleasant&#x2014;than so <foreign><hi rend="italic">pirring</hi></foreign> thro&#x2019; quiet roads in the dusk&#x2014;with the moon coming out&#x2014;I felt as if I were <hi rend="italic">reading about myself in a Miss Austin</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Austen (<date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>).</note> <hi rend="italic">novel!</hi> But it got beyond <hi rend="italic">Miss Austin</hi> when at the end of some three miles before a sort of Carrier&#x2019;s Inn, the gentleman of the barouchette stept into the middle of the road, making a sort of military signal to my driver, which he repeated with impatience when the man did not at once draw up!&#x2014; I sat confounded&#x2014;expecting what he <hi rend="italic">would</hi> do next. We had halted; the gentleman came to my side, and said exactly as in a book &#x201C;Madam! I have the happiness of informing you that I have reclaimed your parasol and it is here in my carriage ready to be restored!&#x201C; &#x201C;But how on earth&#x201C;? I asked&#x2014;&#x201C;Madam I judged that it would be more with yourself, than to trust to its being brought by the other gentleman&#x2014; So I just galloped my horses, overtook the coach as it was leaving this court, reclaimed the parasol, and have waited here&#x2014;knowing you could take no other road to Sherborne&#x2014;for the happiness of presenting it to you!&#x2014;(to an ostler) bring the parasol!&#x201C; It was brought and handed to me&#x2014;and then I found myself making a speech in the same style, caught by the infection of the thing. I said; &#x201C;Sir! this day has been full of mischances for me, but I regard this recovery of my parasol so unexpectedly as a good omen, and <pb id="pg-27-209" n="27:209"/>have a confidence that I shall now reach my destination in safety&#x2014;accept my thanks tho&#x2019; it is impossible to give any adequate expression to my sense of your courtesy&#x201C;! I never certainly made so long and formal a speech in my life! And how I came to make any thing like it I cant imagine unless it were under mesmerism! We bowed to each other like first cousins of Sir Charles Grandison<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The gentlemanly paragon in Samuel Richardson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The History of Sir Charles Grandison</hi> (<date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>).</note>&#x2014;and I <hi rend="italic">pirred</hi> on&#x2014; Do you know that gentleman? I asked my driver &#x201C;Never saw him before&#x201C;&#x2014; I found Sherborne House without difficulty&#x2014;and a stately beautiful house it was and a kind welcome it had for me&#x2014; The mistake had been discovered in the morning and great anxiety felt all day as to my fate&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was wonderfully little tired and able to make them all (<hi rend="italic">her</hi> too) laugh with my adventures&#x2014; But I must positively interrupt this penny a lining<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hack journalism.</note> and go to bed&#x2014; It is true <hi rend="small-caps">to the letter</hi> all I have told. My two days at Sherborne House were as happy as could possibly be with that fearfully emaciated dying woman before my eyes. They were all doing their best to be cheerful. herself as cheerful as the others. She never spoke of her death except in taking leave of me; when she took my head in her hands and kissed it and gave me her solemn blessing and asked me to come again, with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, to see William and the children when <hi rend="italic">she</hi> should be gone&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">That</hi> was a dreadful trial of my composure I am so glad I went it pleased her and all of them so much! The journey back by Dorchester went all right&#x2014;and was less expensive, for I came by the second class, so saved the nine shillings my <hi rend="italic">gig</hi> had cost me. It was a weary long way however&#x2014;from a quarter before nine till half after seven flying along in one shape or other&#x2014;with only ten minutes delay&#x2014;(at Southampton) My only <hi rend="italic">adventure</hi> on the road back was falling in with a young <hi rend="italic">Unfortunate Female</hi> in the Chelsea boat, the strangest compound of Angel and Devil that I ever set eyes on, and whom, had I been a great, rich Lady, I should decidedly have&#x2014;brought home to tea with me, and tried &#x201C;to <hi rend="italic">save</hi>&#x201C;! The helpless thought that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had nothing to offer her <hi rend="small-caps">instead</hi> alone prevented me&#x2014; I could not leave her however without&#x2014;speaking to her!&#x2014;and my words were so moving,&#x2014;thro my own emotion,&#x2014;that she rushed from me <hi rend="italic">in tears</hi> to the other side of the vessel. You may feel <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> curiosity to know what I said. I hardly recollect&#x2014;something about &#x201C;her Mother, alive or dead&#x2014;and her evident superiority to the life she was leading.&#x201C; She said &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">do you think so Mam</hi>, with a look of bitter wretchedness and forced gaiety that I shall never forget&#x2014;she was trying to <hi rend="italic">smile</hi> defiantly, when she burst into tears and ran away.</p>
<p>I dont know very well where to direct to you now&#x2014;it is long since I got your <pb id="pg-27-210" n="27:210"/>last letter&#x2014;on Sunday at Sherborne&#x2014;but one is not always in the humour for writing letters, and then it is best <hi rend="italic">not to write</hi> them.</p>

<p>No Letter of Travel and Romance from you today, in spite of your half-promise; &#x201C;nothin<hi rend="italic">k</hi> for Craigenputtoch today Ma&#x2019;am&#x201C; at all! And here is my luggage lying all round me in heaps; portmanteau still to pack!&#x2014;or rather to <hi rend="italic">un</hi>pack, first of all; the unfortunate valet having packed it <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>, leaving out a tithe of the due contents. Ah me! the sorrows and chaotic shiftings of man do not end while he continues here below.&#x2014; However, let me write you a &#x201C;soothing word&#x201C; before I set off; let me finish my yesterday&#x2019;s note, hastily <hi rend="italic">addressed</hi> by Mrs Stirling, which, it strikes me since, must have surprised you a little. Oh my poor little Goody, what a <foreign><hi rend="italic">crowdy</hi></foreign> is this we have got into with those frightful Morganites. My head is full of your sad dusty chaos, and my heart is sore for it &#x26; for poor you, with nothing but Martha for a servant too, the Beauty having proved such a fool! What to resolve upon in consequence of all that, I cannot yet see; only that something must be resolved upon:&#x2014;in the meanwhile let me complete my narrative of the Past of Linlathen; and get my packing done without such a bustle as short time may gradually come to occasion again!&#x2014; My malison too upon improved paper and inks! I declare all writing has grown disgusting to me with such an everfluctuating never-suiting apparatus as one now gets!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We successfully completed our trip to Arbroath yesterday;&#x2014;were 25 minutes <hi rend="italic">too early</hi> at the Broughty Station here, after all the fierce hurry we made! Arbroath is the big smoky dusty flax-spinning old Scotch town I anticipated: but the old ruined Abbey (poor old wretch), and the fat enthusiast <foreign><hi rend="italic">cicerone</hi></foreign> of it, were really worth looking at, and shall be remembered: we saw the very grave of William the Lion, and his <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> or &#x201C;part of his entrails&#x201C; kneaded into a hard mass like furnace-cinder (only lighter); item the scull and cross-bone of his poor Queen, who had been buried (750 years ago) all sewed in leather:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William the Lyon (<date when="1143-00-00">1143</date>&#x2013;<date when="1214-00-00">1214</date>), king of Scotland, who had founded the abbey, <date when="1178-00-00">1178</date>, and his queen, Ermengarde (d. <date when="1233-00-00">1233</date>), who was buried in the abbey at Balmerino in Fife.</note> I could have <foreign><hi rend="italic">grat</hi></foreign> over these and other relics. Farie was very dull and dreadfully tired; the good Thomas was good all the way, as he ever is. We got home in time for dinner; and a weary day was winded up by a ditto evening.&#x2014; No Letters at all this morning, as I tell you; indeed except three Notes from John, I have had nothing since I came here except what you sent me,&#x2014;thank Heaven. I have done some (highly inconsiderable) reading; much chaotic &#x201C;thought and feeling&#x201C;: the masons, it appears, are where I left them. N.b. I wrote a <foreign>mittimus</foreign> [legal discharge] yesterday to the poor &#x201C;Mr John Taylor&#x201C;: he <pb id="pg-27-212" n="27:212"/>will call for his ill-smelling <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi>, give it him, and so there will be an end.&#x2014;&#x2014; I wrote also to Gordon in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, politeness ordering; <hi rend="italic">item</hi> to Countess Blanche of Airlie: response <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have come from both this morning, but has not: again, thank Heaven; there will be <hi rend="italic">no</hi> farther bother in it then. I had promised to see Gordon &#x201C;till my train started,&#x201C; in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, but he evidently is not there. To Blanche I mildly waved farewell, indicating how gladly I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have come, had I possessed the wings of a dove, which I hadn&#x2019;t.&#x2014; Two days ago, there came a strange stupid-looking old face up to me among the trees, Farie escorting it. On strict survey, it proved to be one Henderson, once an Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> friend of your Uncle Robert&#x2019;s, now some kind of Sheriff here at Dundee, whom I once had slightly known.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Irvine Henderson (d. <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), advocate, formerly sheriff-substitute of Dundee and evidently a friend of Robert Welsh of Edinburgh.</note> It seems the Dundee Editor<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were three Dundee newspapers.</note> and others (being fearfully &#x201C;scant of <hi rend="italic">clash</hi>&#x201C;) had announced that I was here &#x201C;partaking hospitality&#x201C;: whereupon Henderson decided, he &#x201C;w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come and see whether I knew him.&#x201C; Such are the unspeakable advantages of celebrity! Poor Henderson is grown, of course, white and hoary; but there is little other change in him: a big fat field of cheek and small pig eyes; a slow, dull, yet a kind of healthy and not stupid or ill-conditioned man. We all went to the shore together, I to bathe; and there we got rid of him.&#x2014; Alas, here again is uproar; Mrs Stirling leave-taking &#x26;c: I must finish, I must finish. At 12&#xBD; (an hour hence) I go; towards 3 I am in Fergusdom: next day (Saturday) I get to Scotsbrig if all go well; I am probably on the road thither at the very time you are reading this. Direct to Scotsbrig; and Oh have a letter there <hi rend="italic">soon.</hi> Nay I think you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> have one now till Tuesday (writing, Monday <hi rend="italic">before</hi> 4&#xBD; p.m.) along with the Newspapers. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest, <foreign>Adieu</foreign>&#x2014;oh dear, why was travelling ever invented!&#x2014;Take care of yourself.&#x2014;&#x2014; Your affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Thanks, dear little Goody, for your copious entertaining Narrative of your adventures;</salute> which, if it failed at Linlathen, was duly lying here to welcome me when I arrived on Saturday evening. Your expedition to the west had its romantic ups and downs for the Doggie and you; all ending handsomely, however: certainly in the annals of modern courtesy it would not be easy to <pb id="pg-27-213" n="27:213"/>parallel that of the galloping barouchette; we may say, in a superficial sense, the age of chivalry is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> gone!&#x2014; Poor Mrs Macready, that image of your parting with her is very sad. But it was a pious debt you had to pay, this journey you have made; and we hope it will have done you nothing but good either outwardly or inwardly. You had a dreadful quarry of noise and dust and mad confusion to return to; which is quite appalling to myself whenever I think of it; which, in the present windbound state of our affairs, is a thing I very often or indeed almost continually do. Catch me consenting to a &#x201C;thorough reparation&#x201C; ever in my life again! What to do in the business I cannot yet in the least decide; and yet decided it must be before we are many days older.</p>
<p>At one o&#x2019;clock on Friday last, an hour after the last letter I wrote you, Erskine and Farie (faithful escorts, who however cost me a hottish <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> instead of riding) put me on board the railway steamer at Broughty; and in less than two hours more, after no adventure, or experience except that of sadness, solitude (beside two innocent stupid human beings, male and female) and on the whole oppression and <foreign>ennui</foreign>, Fergus and Royd<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Fergus and his sister Jane&#x2019;s husband.</note> were to be seen waiting for me on the Kirkcaldy Platform; and there I alighted, to pause for exactly 24 hours, for my only good train (it turned out) was this one I was now quitting. All was very high and grand in the Fergus house, and I may say extremely kind,&#x2014;had it not been so &#x201C;undeniably dull,&#x201C; aggravated now by the suspicion that I think it dull,&#x2014;heigho! However, the afternoon was dry and airy; F. and I walked westward along the beach, and I had one other nice bathe, in a delightful cove among rocks: seven o&#x2019;clock came at last; the Royds were very quiet, no other company,&#x2014;nothing wrong with the <hi rend="italic">butter</hi> either;&#x2014;and on the whole the time rolled tolerably along. Mrs Royd, who has much more female talent than most of the Ferguses, sang Scotch songs: an exquisite voice, better than any Lind&#x2019;s, I thought, but spoiled by ornamental flourishings, super-refinements and want of true intellect: she sang <hi rend="italic">Coolun</hi> with such melody as was never heard, and yet poor Goody&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">play</hi> of it on the Piano with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> any singing is a better thing.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Originally a celebrated Irish air, it was included in George Thomson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice</hi>, sets 1&#x2013;4 (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1799-00-00">99</date>), beginning &#x201C;Oh, the hours I have passed&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480620-TC-WS-01"><sic>23:56</sic><corr>TC to WS, <date when="1848-06-20">20 June 1848</date></corr></ref> where unidentified.</note> Huhu!

Of course I &#x201C;remembered&#x201C; Auchtertool; but in the present lie of circumstances, and mood of my own stomach and heart, there seemed no possibility,&#x2014;and will explain when Jack goes.</p>
<p>In Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I loitered 55 minutes by the clock,&#x2014;day fine, but defective in wind,&#x2014;no soul visible, or clearly conceivable, whose acquaintance I desired or had ever had: of mortal man only old Dr Monroe<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Dr. Alexander Monro (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18966"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), anatomist, joint prof. of anatomy and surgery, Edinburgh univ., <date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>; sole prof., <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>.</note> and (as I <hi rend="italic">now</hi> bethink me, for at the time I did not rightly heed it and had only an unpleasant feeling of surprise and riddlemaree) Lord John Russel, those were the only creatures I had ever seen before. However, I had a cigar; and I decided to walk with it in the Grassmarket (unvisited for 30 or 40 years), and to see, if you can believe it, the West Bow again where poor Goody (not the Goody I now have to me) bought a <hi rend="italic">snuff mull</hi> long ago. Alas, the West Bow itself has taken wings, there is now no West Bow, but a broad fashionable kind of Circus, with worsted-shops, print-shops, and I almost think a kind of Terrace: much has taken wings! On the shady side of the Grassmarket, however, I had seen groups of lazy dirty women and children squatted on the flagstones, cheerfully gossiping, who seemed to be possibly rather &#x201C;happy,&#x201C;&#x2014;poor little Jeffrey, gone too, all gone!&#x2014; It was on the N. Bridge that I saw Lord Johnny; in the train itself Monroe (very ugly and baggy) who got out at Slateford, intending apparently, like several others, some Sunday amid the Pentlands<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hills S of Edinburgh.</note> in some neat box handy by. Of the rest of my journey I say nothing; except that a vile waiting-place, &#x201C;Carstairs&#x201C; I think, where we hung on for 25 minutes, waiting for other trains, and without leave even to smoke, I saw from my window a bluenosed enigmatic figure, amid the simmering crowd making toward some refresh<hi rend="italic">t</hi>-room, who, in the act of passing me, plainly disclosed himself as <hi rend="italic">John Gordon;</hi> to whom, in my horrible state of torpor, I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> make sign, alarmed at the starting of speech in such a moment; and we were gone before he reappeared. Alas, has not life tragedies in it? At this station, when the Glasgow trains did arrive, I got two <hi rend="italic">inmates</hi> into my carriage: a foolish <hi rend="italic">loll</hi> of an old Cumberland gigwoman and her foolish old fishing and touring gigman of a husband; who were in open quarrel, at least the wife was, and quite in the wrong too (mark that); by whom the rest of the journey was made still duller and more mephitic, and especially the prospect I had had of a cigar was totally cut off! I declined any conversation (to speak of); but sat silently looking out upon the moors and the setting sun, and infinite space and the worlds of memory and eternity; and so, after some dashing showers, which all <pb id="pg-27-215" n="27:215"/>ended about Lockerby, I found Jamie on the station-platform with a gig hard by; welcome tea under this roof about 9 p.m.,&#x2014;and so here I am, at another point of my program. Since I began writing there has come a Note, thro&#x2019; Linlathen, from Countess Blanche; I could not have gone (tell her if you write) in the mood I was in; and am happy to be off, which you needn&#x2019;t tell her.</p>
<p>My poor old Mother is wonderfully brisk these two days, her eyes quite bright and lively, tho&#x2019; evidently she is feebleness&#x2019;s self. Isabella is weakly too; and I believe goes soon off to Whinnyrigg for &#x201C;sea-air.&#x201C; Marg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Austin takes charge now upstairs; and to her I, by invisible but strict laws of the place, am mainly assigned; a change by no means in my favour. Jack has not yet showed face; is about Moffat, after gratis &#x201C;patients&#x201C;: both Jamie and my Mother seem a little tired of these gratis patients, of this incessant <foreign>jingling</foreign> after nothing at all. Jack however, poor good soul, finds it infinitely important and a quite interesting rural existence. He has trimmed all the outskirts of Scotsbrig into a really neat, railed planted condition, and beautified this his own room very much, where I have lodged these two past nights,&#x2014;where however there is a sad smell of paint, defect of the old ventilation, and no good sleep procurable hitherto. He comes this evening; I shift into the other room. He is for Fife and a &#x201C;consultation at Auchtertool,&#x201C; as he wrote, in a day or two hence. My <hi rend="italic">inner man</hi> (so-called) is very ill off here hitherto; and I mean to resume my <hi rend="italic">compress</hi>, which I had been obliged to lay aside ever since leaving home.&#x2014; This is all, dear Jeannie mine; surely this is enough!</p>
<p>Of Germany &#x26;c I will say nothing, indeed can say nothing, till I get time to reflect. My heart shudders at any kind of travelling, with such nerves and such digestion as I have. But somewhither, it appears, we must go; and kind of faint call of duty seems to point towards Germany rather. But it will never do to leave you behind me: you surely deserve this one little pleasure, since it is going; there are so few that you can get from me in this world! If we go, therefore, it is <hi rend="italic">we</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">I;</hi> so far I see. But how to go? Curtainless beds, noisy sleepless nights&#x2014;Neuberg himself is rather formidable to me! For indeed I am very weak at present, much disheartened, dyspeptical, and in fine contemptible (as I often urge) in some degree! &#x201C;Ye must just excuse us the&#x2014;day.&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; To Gully&#x2019;s I cannot think of returning; especially for so long a time, nor indeed to Malvern much at all. But a <hi rend="italic">rustic</hi> village &#x201C;somewhere&#x201C; might be truly agreeable! More next time.</p>
<p>My poor old Mother comes in with her anxious sincere old face: &#x201C;Send my love to Jane, and tell her&#x201C; (this with a <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign>ish tone) &#x201C;I wad like richt weel to have a <foreign>crack</foreign> wi&#x2019; her,&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;once mair,&#x201C; she phrased it last night, the good old woman.</p>

<p><salute>Oh my Dear!</salute> What a comfortless letter! In your last from Linlathen you said you were &#x201C;decidedly better,&#x201C; and now you seem to be again &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all nohow</hi>&#x201C;! I hope it has only been the fag of the journey. Dont fret about the house; it is getting on pretty fast now, and <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be satisfactory when finished. For my part I am got quite used to the disturbance, and begin to like the what shall I say?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">excitement</hi> of it&#x2014;to see something <hi rend="italic">going on</hi> and to help its going on fulfils a great want of my nature! I have prevented so many mistakes being made, and afforded so many capital suggestions, that I begin to feel rather proud of myself, and to suspect I must have been a <hi rend="italic">Builder</hi> in some previous state of existence. The Painter is my chief delight, he does his work so <hi rend="italic">thoroughly;</hi> he is only in your bedroom as yet, but he has rubbed it all down with pumice stone till it looks as smooth as paper. And I have never been at all inconvenienced by any smell!&#x2014; Perhaps the house may be <hi rend="italic">habitable</hi> a week or two sooner than I guessed, tho&#x2019; I hardly think the workmen will be fairly out of it sooner&#x2014; I shall &#x201C;see my way&#x201C; better next week&#x2014; The weather is capital for drying both paint and plaster&#x2014;that is <hi rend="italic">one</hi> blessing! My <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of the low room is kept always tidy&#x2014;the bedding, and tables with their legs in the air, as if in convulsions which show themselves <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the screen often make me laugh&#x2014; When the noise is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> great I <hi rend="italic">practice</hi> on the piano! I do quite well in short, and dont see how I can be spared till things are done to my mind, and the chaotic heaps of furniture restored to their proper places, Decidedly nobody but myself can do <hi rend="italic">that.</hi></p>
<p>I found your letter today on my return from Tavistock House<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Dickenses&#x2019; home in Tavistock Sq., since <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>.

He is staying there <hi rend="italic">for a change</hi> in the absence of the Dickenses&#x2014; I had promised the Macreadys to go and tell him about <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, and found no time till today. I went by the boat to Paul&#x2019;s warf,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >S of St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral, considerably E of her destination.</note> like a goose, and found myself so far off my destination! Besides, a violent thunder shower fell just as I set my foot on land, and having on a pair of those <hi rend="italic">cheap</hi> boots I bought <hi rend="italic">a stock of</hi>&#x2014;(chiefly <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle!) My feet were wet thro in two minutes&#x2014;I went into a shop and bought a pair of stockings, then on till I <pb id="pg-27-217" n="27:217"/>found a good looking shoeshop and bought a pair of <hi rend="italic">real</hi> boots. left my dripping stockings and paper boots with the Shoemaker, requesting that when they were dry&#x2014;and not till then&#x2014;he would pack them up and send them to the care of Forster&#x2014;and so proceeded on my long walk dry-shod&#x2014;cleverly managed dont you think &#x201C;regardless of expense&#x201C;? Forster was very glad to see me, he is <hi rend="italic">a little</hi> less helpless&#x2014;but still on fish diet&#x2014;I got into a Holborn omnibus after, which left me at the top of Regent Street, and then I went to Verey&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Verrey&#x2019;s, restaurant, Hanover St.</note> and had&#x2014;a beautiful little mutton chop! and a glass of bitter ale! <hi rend="italic">That</hi> is the sort of things I do!&#x2014; It was my second dinner at Vereys, <hi rend="italic">meat dinners</hi> at home are as nearly impossible as can be&#x2014;and one sleeps ill on tea dinners the <hi rend="italic">chaarge</hi> at Vereys is very moderate and the cooking <hi rend="italic">perfect.</hi> for my dinner and ale today I paid one and five pence. The day I went to the Foundry I dined at a clean looking shop in the Strand, where I had half a roast chicken (warm very small indeed) a large slice of warm ham and three new potatoes for one shilling! It amuses me all that; besides keeping me in health and for the outrage to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">delicate female</hi>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">ism</hi> I am beyond all such considerations at present.

<salute>Dear Lady Airlie,</salute>
<p>Your kind little Note finds me here, on my next shift southward. I did leave Linlathen that Friday; and, by gentle stages, am now in my good old Mother&#x2019;s house, amid scenes very strange (once so familiar), very sad, very beautiful, and full of interest to me,&#x2014;but far away from Co<supplied>[r]</supplied>tachy<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> Castle, of which there is clearly no hope on my side this year! Instead of the Grampians, I have now the so-called &#x201C;English Hills&#x201C; (Skiddaw, Helvellyn and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>) full in sight of me; and my course is towards Chelsea and the south, in a few, I know not how few, days hence. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, therefore, once more. If I have time, and things prove suitable, I shall be strongly tempted to make a call at Alderley in passing, where perhaps I shall hear of you: but that, like so much that is to follow, is very uncertain at present. My Wife is full of building operations, and surrounded with dust and noise and architectural and upholstery improvements, in Cheyne Row; there is considerable talk of our escaping to Germany, for six weeks, out of all that; but the speculation has not yet quite advanced to certainty, tho&#x2019; it must now, either one way or the other, very soon.</p>
<p>My Wife, writing yesterday, reports indirectly (thro&#x2019; Milnes, I think) that L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and Lady Ashburton have gone to Switzerland instead of Bad Gastein as once intended; and that his Lordship has quite recovered health, and is now &#x201C;running up hills&#x201C; &#x26;c. They are to return early in <date when="1852-09-00">September</date>. Mrs Milnes, as you doubtless know, has given Mr. and the world a little Daughter; who, we hope, will one day be the joy and sorrow of some worthy person&#x2019;s son that was <pb id="pg-27-219" n="27:219"/>born lately into these latitudes: poor little souls, they also have to take their destiny here below when their time comes! Jane added a rumour of two robberies: robbery first, the pocket of Thackeray picked of a &#xa3;100 Note in foreign parts (may it burn the thief&#x2019;s fingers!)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Ray 3:58&#x2013;59.</note>&#x2014;robbery second, Mrs Ruskin&#x2019;s jewels (pretty Mrs Ruskin, one of the daintiest Scotchwomen married to <hi rend="italic">a Prince</hi> &#x201C;of Criticism,&#x201C; and I doubt not valuable jewels, for they are rich and she is bright and gay) all stolen, in Italy, by some English-Austrian spy and swindler; and, what makes it worse, the Newspaper narrative of the affair, is headed &#x201C;Stones of Venice,&#x201C; which is the title of her husband&#x2019;s last Book.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ruskins had returned home on <date when="1852-07-13">13 July</date> after ten months in Italy. On <date when="1852-06-12">12 June</date>, Euphemia Ruskin had been robbed of jewels in their hotel in Venice while she was out. The chief suspect seems to have been an Englishman named Foster on the Austrian general staff, and his fellow officers made every effort to thwart police investigation. Ruskin himself was even challenged to a duel because of his alleged insinuations about Foster. See Mary Lutyens ed., <hi rend="italic">Effie in Venice Unpublished Letters of Mrs John Ruskin</hi> (<date when="1965-00-00">1965</date>) 320&#x2013;43. The <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> had the story, <date when="1852-07-21">21 July</date>, and other papers copied it, some implying that Ruskin had accused the officer out of jealousy. To set the matter straight Ruskin wrote to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of <date when="1852-08-02">2 Aug.</date></note> How mischievous are mankind one to another, with object and without! On the other hand, your little sculptor of genius, who was to have done L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Airlie and didn&#x2019;t, is off to the Diggings in Australia;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Woolner had sailed for Melbourne, <date when="1852-07-24">24 July</date>.

<p>Here is another nice little Letter from you; full of lively details, which bring the scene quite before one! I read the Doctor&#x2019;s letter yesterday too; and am now pretty well off for news.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-220" n="27:220"/>Don&#x2019;t bother yourself about my &#x201C;health and spirits&#x201C;: that is not worse at all than usual; nay rather it is better,&#x2014;especially today after a capital sleep (my best for six weeks): nor is the gloom of my mind a whit increased; it is the nature of the beast, and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> lives in a continual element of black broken by lightnings, and cannot help it, poor devil!</p>
<p>All is <hi rend="italic">disorder</hi> here, a foot below the surface; distressing enough to me to look upon for my poor old weak Mother&#x2019;s sake;&#x2014;and Jack seems noway joyful in his filial function, and much fonder of gratis medicine than of that. I will tell you about it all when we meet; meanwhile not a word of it, not a whisper of it to any ear!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wish I could give you a final resolution about Germany: but today <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> there are &#x201C;doubts&#x201C; (and will ever be till the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> itself, negative or positive, shew face!)&#x2014;nay you confirm what I supposed likely that your presence at Chelsea, for some weeks to come, may be really useful and even needful. Suppose I went to Germany first, and did Silesia with Neuberg, and then <hi rend="italic">waited</hi> for you in any convenient place, to do Berlin and what remained? That notion has struck me today. But in fact my general feeling towards the whole enterprise is too apt to be one of <foreign><hi rend="italic">scunner</hi></foreign> and horror. The sleepless nights, the misery of dyspeptic days, and the general prevailing <foreign><hi rend="italic">ennui</hi></foreign> towards all one is likely to see and hear: this presses on the human imagination from such an element as my present one. Oh Goody, Goody!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I truly rejoice to see what <foreign>spunk</foreign> is in you; and how you can dine at V&#xE9;ry&#x2019;s, and do such spirited and gallant things. A <hi rend="italic">meat dinner</hi> I recommend to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, with confidence, every day; go up daily to some such locality, since there is no hope of it at home. Poor Fuz, I fear he is still in a lingering coil of weakness and illness. Perhaps I ought to write him a word; but at present I have not heart even for that.</p>
<p>Thackeray&#x2019;s &#xa3;100, and the &#x201C;Stones of Venice,&#x201C; what a pair of adventures! On the whole your Brookfield dinner was good, and the description of it is altogether (for me) considerably better.</p>
<p>Here too there is no faith in weather! I talked yesterday of getting into the fields with my Book: yesterday forenoon was bright, warm, hopeful, &#x26; sunny; but towards evening black eastwinds with rain came loaded out of Cumberland (where they had been busy since morning); and today all is damp, with a cold moaning Northwind and occasional showers.</p>
<p>I purpose to write again tomorrow or next day,&#x2014;very soon at least;&#x2014;but have no farther paper or capacity at present. Jack will write the instant he gets the <hi rend="italic">Macready</hi> Letter.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Take care of thyself, poor Goody, and Heaven bless thee!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute> I was never in my life so ill off for news from you: it is now above 4 weeks since the smallest direct word reached me; and had it not been for fortunate side-winds, twice, with their vague assurance that you were gone to Switzerland, and were both well, Lord A. too, I should have been, and not in my imagination alone, seriously uneasy. Bad luck is alone to blame, I know. It is not you that I blame&#x2014;how far from that, now or ever! Nor will I curiously inquire who or what is to blame; there is no end of &#x201C;blaming,&#x201C; if one once begin it, in this world. Only it is certain, I did, in spite of obstructions, write to your Highness <hi rend="italic">twice:</hi> the first time, under endless jeopardy and hurry, just on the eve of getting into a Steamer for Scotland, date Chelsea, <date when="1852-07-21">21 july</date>; announcing in semi-articulate language that I was bound for Linlathen and a certain Scottish Saint and Sage called Thomas Erskine&#x2019;s; this Note was addressed &#x201C;Homburg,&#x201C; and left with my Wife, who no doubt posted it that day. The second writing was perhaps about six days after (<date when="1852-07-27">27 july</date>, so far as I can recollect); this, thinking you might have quitted Homburg, I addressed, H&#xF4;tel de l&#x2019;Europe, Frankf<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a.m.,&#x2014;and hoped well they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> send it after you, and find you with it in the vague! Alas, I now imagine neither of these missives ever came to hand; whence all those gloomy imaginations of mine in late times! If the Letters now never reach you, do not regret them, rejoice rather, for they were otherwise worth nothing; and may wander on the winds to all eternity with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> harm to anybody or to themselves. Only do now write a word, if this reach you, as I hope it will: I decide on trying Bath House, seeing no other chance, after waiting in daily hope to no purpose so long. And be good to me, if you still can, to a creature so bad, and with a luck so bad!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane went to Bath House, of her own accord, shortly after my departure; for Weber had left us really anxious about your Homburg affairs: it was there she learned, and I, that you were off towards Switzerland, and that Lord A. was already quite on foot again and the prospect much mended: this had to serve me till yesterday when, from a dinner at Brookfield&#x2019;s, there came, by the same channel, a second message: Jane had seen Milnes there who reported, from yourself, that you had had a <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>-adventure (ugly enough to think of) on the route; but were now in Switz<hi rend="italic">d</hi> &#x201C;somewhere,&#x201C; and that Lord A. was &#x201C;running up hills&#x201C; (that was the comfortable phrase): with these two hints, and what inferences I could draw from them, I have had to content myself hitherto. Do I not deserve a little Note, in these circumstances, think <pb id="pg-27-222" n="27:222"/>you? Address Chelsea: that is the only sure place for a minimum of delay now, and your news will probably come at once into my own hand there.</p>
<p>At Chelsea, as I hear, all is still noise and and<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> confusion, just as when I fled from it, and is like to be. &#x201C;Nearly two months yet&#x201C; is Jane&#x2019;s prediction; that, instead of the &#x201C;six weeks&#x201C; originally talked of which are now just expiring! Jane, who is architect, and general manager, rectificator, and commander-in-chief (and really quite expert at the art, &#x201C;with an eye equal to a carpenter&#x2019;s square,&#x201C; and other appropriate virtues and gifts), continues there, constantly all this while except one little journey into Dorsetshire; hardly defending now two little rooms from the general influx of Chaos; and appears almost to like it, there is such action and reaction and victorious excitement going on! As for me, I do not in the least like it,&#x2014;and could much wish my poor bedroom were clean and quiet again: I should in all likelihood decide for running home thither, and in a cowardly manner going to sleep! Which, as matters stand, I cannot do: and so the sad question has arisen, what then to do? Which is very severe upon me in these current days! The Germans have a word <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kopfbrechen</hi></foreign> (Head-breaking) appropriate to such cases, which I find a singularly applicable one. The human soul, after so much futile tossing and struggling on the monstrous Gulf-stream with its icebergs and dead-dogs (for neither are wanting), w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> prefer to lie floating, with nothing but its <hi rend="italic">nose</hi> above, and wait whither the <hi rend="italic">mere</hi> currents would drive it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I did very well at Linlathen; bathed diligently in the German Ocean (<hi rend="italic">un</hi>able to swim across to you); and the good people, contrary to wont, but according to bargain, left me perfectly solitary for &#x201C;six hours every day,&#x201C; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was time enough for Prussian Books, and for solitary thoughts still <hi rend="italic">more</hi> vague and stupid. I lay oftenest under the shade of big trees; and had, at intervals, command of tobacco. We had Scotch songs of an evening now and then (not happy in the singing); prayers and much serious talk (lifted into a kind of <hi rend="italic">universal</hi> dialect, for my sake) by day: in fine, my time having fairly expired, the voice of conscience ordered me to lift anchor and depart; which I did, with the emotions due to such friends and such a <hi rend="italic">self</hi> and such a situation,&#x2014;with an immense base feeling of biliary <hi rend="italic">laziness</hi> for one thing. I lingered one day in Fife; walked, silent and full of rather ghastly thoughts, over the City of Edinburgh for the best part of an hour; then got into the train for Annandale, passed thro&#x2019; some shadows of you about Beattock and elsewhere (as is perhaps too much my wont in all roads and localities), and so arrived here, safe, tho&#x2019; cold, dispirited and weary, on Saturday night last, where I still am for some few indefinite days,&#x2014;such a scene, and such reminiscences and confused emotions sad and beautiful as I have on other occasions <pb id="pg-27-223" n="27:223"/>described to you. Oh my noble Lady, I am very sad of heart, and very solitary; and often think, while I look at facts and shadows such as float and seethe in the troublous sight and fancy, it might easily be better in Heaven than they have it hereabouts where we pass what is called life in this time! But there should be no complaining anyhow, and there shall not be much.</p>
<p>Whether to go to Germany straightway; or to give up <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and <hi rend="italic">it</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> really w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be difficult) forever and a day? That is the question. Jane urges me to go &#x201C;myself,&#x201C; but that is only generosity and female human heroism; I know well she ought to go with me, and she cannot in these weeks be well spared at Chelsea, were all else right and ready. Today I have a Letter from her full of spirits; but arguing that she really cannot be spared till the work is farther on. Suppose I went myself with Neuberg in a 10 days hence, saw Silesia,&#x2014;Breslau and the Riesengebirge to Prag,&#x2014;then <hi rend="italic">waited</hi> about Karlsbad, or some Schwalbach,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quiet spa in the mountains.</note> or <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> Homburg (if there were one) to see whether she or any one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> join me thereabouts, for Berlin and what might follow? <hi rend="italic">You</hi> are to be home by the middle of <date when="1852-09-00">September</date>; you are fixed as fate,&#x2014;honour to you;&#x2014;but I do not know your route as yet; nor, alas, why sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I ask to know it!&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>Blessings on you beautiful Lady, and Friend sent me by the Heavens!&#x2014; Write to Chelsea like a good child; and continue well wherever you are. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>.&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>

<p><salute>Dear Little Goody,&#x2014;</salute>On reflexion, I find that this is the last post of the week; so I may as well write you a word, by way of complement to yesterday&#x2019;s confused story; tho&#x2019;, as is natural, there is not the smallest particle of new occurrence, nor anything in the least strange to be said. I pride myself on the <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> you are to have, on Saturday night, after reading this; and feel what a pleasant anticipation that will be, while you sit at tea with my prophecy of it in your hand! Poor Nero himself, I suppose, must be disturbed out of his natural rest by these commotions; how much more his mistress: truly I am sorry for you; and thank the Old Jews for providing at least one fair chance in the week for the wearied believer. The quantity of (mostly avoidable) <hi rend="italic">physical</hi> noise and disturbance, and sad mutual misery therefrom, which human beings have provided for one another, is truly surprising.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-224" n="27:224"/>Today there reigns the admirablest quiet in this establishment; and out of it the loveliest autumn day that could have dawned. All creatures have gone off to the Lockerby Lamb Fair: more power to their elbow! Even John is gone; intending next for Moffat, or indeed he scarcely knows whither: a most locomotive man, and perhaps the idlest that now fancies himself full of business in this part of her Majesty&#x2019;s dominions. Perhaps he will come back by tomorrow evening&#x2019;s train; perhaps he will go on to Edinburgh; perhaps&#x2014;?&#x2014;On the whole, tho&#x2019; he struggles to be goodnatured to me, and I can now and then get some words of really rational conversation with him (for he, at least, <hi rend="italic">understands</hi> everything that is said), I find his continual close-rubbing on me in this narrow household a thing that requires management, and yields but a mixed return. Futile affections, sad memories, much that is <hi rend="italic">futile</hi>, and has proved other than one had hoped. Poor soul, I know no such wasted set of faculties in all this world; and wonder withal at the provision Nature has made for keeping him happy and, at little expense, quasi-victorious under that perversity of destiny. &#x201C;He gets five or six letters aday,&#x201C; says Jamie, &#x201C;and I dare say little in them.&#x201C; Business, forever business: a rattling as of vast floors of nuts continually getting stirred and shovelled,&#x2014;all <hi rend="italic">deaf.</hi> Not a kernel to be met with:&#x2014;if there be not one perhaps in this of Mrs Watts;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Phoebe Elizabeth H. Watt, a widow with four sons, whom John Carlyle had known for about fifteen years and m., <date when="1852-11-02">2 Nov.</date> See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480121-JWC-TC-01"><sic>22:225</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1848-01-21">21 Jan. 1848</date></corr></ref>.</note> in whom Isabella pretended to read symptoms? I believe it might well be an improvement: but, as usual, there will in all probability nothing come of it at last. &#x201C;Poor fellow, after all!&#x201C; He has a contended,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> cheery thoroughly unmalicious heart; and these are enviable virtues as the world goes.&#x2014;&#x2014; Isabella is down to Whinnyrigg, with her oldest and youngest children, since the day before yesterday, &#x201C;for a week of sea air.&#x201C; My Mother is reading Luther&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Table Talk</hi>, and I have got Jack&#x2019;s firm fir-desk in the other end of the house. Marg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Austin, a really handy lass, is preparing me two eggs and a <foreign>mutchkin</foreign> of curdled milk for dinner at 3; and is so silent one cannot hear her in the absolute noiselessness which otherwise prevails. I sat for a morning&#x2019;s lesson (actually sat <hi rend="italic">today</hi>) in the bottom of Scotsbrig linn, on a fine flat crag (where one could lean too, and had a checquer of leaves for shade) in the middle of the gushing burn; the air pure as Heaven: really one of the nicest places, and a kind of <hi rend="italic">bath</hi> for one&#x2019;s sick polluted and smoky soul,&#x2014;a symbolical bath, so clear and pure were all things, a stripe of the immeasureable azure overhead, and tones of Eternity audible amid the solo-singing of the <hi rend="italic">burn. <foreign>Ach Gott in Himmel, wie reich, und doch wie arm, wie bettel-arm</foreign></hi> [Ah God in Heaven, how rich, and yet how poor, how destitute]!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-225" n="27:225"/>Of Germany I will say nothing more till perhaps monday next. On the whole there is nothing to drive me thither but a kind of shame, and the desire <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be a poor coward. Of pleasure I could expect absolutely none; of pain and disgraceful wretchedness very much. Nor do I care much for quitting even <hi rend="italic">Frederic;</hi> really at heart I do not much love him: yet perhaps I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> write a goodish kind of Book upon him; and it is disgraceful to be driven away by beds with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> curtains, and the freaks of a diseased fancy and exasperated nerves. Early next week I must write to Neuberg, Yes or No. On the whole <hi rend="italic">you could</hi> join me just as well, after Silesia, could not you; and that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give the workers four weeks more of you? Tell me next time, When you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> get away with least damage to the workers, or whether not with none by and by?&#x2014; The grand argument with me, I believe will be <hi rend="italic">necessity;</hi> as is usually the case with mortals so circumstanced! No more of it, for one day.</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear of your one good worker being still busy in my room; that surely must be the smallest of his &#x201C;paintings,&#x201C;&#x2014;paintings not the thing most necessary there! However, I leave it all to Goody, I do loyally; and foresee that, one way or other, she will actually make a nice thing of it: she never failed yet, the shifty little creature. But are you putting some clothes-shelves, some Press, or an apparatus for convenient stowage of clothes? Think of that, my ingenious Goody; do not desert me there! I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> once of <hi rend="italic">shelves</hi> with a door at the left-hand corner of the fireplace: w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> that do anything? The &#x201C;tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi>&#x201C; was cursory, and I pretend only to state the want; by no means to provide for it;&#x2014;is not that ingenuous? One other thing tell me, and no more: <hi rend="italic">Has</hi> Morgan put in that <hi rend="italic">Hole</hi> in the cornice; that ventilating cavity, I mean, which is to shut and open from the upper window? If he have forgotten&#x2014;! But he cannot have forgotten; nor will Goody permit him. Fergus told me, Cubitt&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The building firm of Thomas Cubitt (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6859"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) and his brother William (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>).</note> plan now is, simply to put a hole <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019;</hi> the wall above each window; hole free into the air, with a <hi rend="italic">lid</hi> at the inner end of it wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you can open or shut with a string. Nothing better; not even my own plan, tho&#x2019; perhaps as good.&#x2014; &#x2014; Oh Goody, Goody, take thy morsel of tea; and may it be drink indeed to thy poor little soul,&#x2014;and give Nero a drop (very weak and sweetish),&#x2014;and fling away this rag in peace of mind; and sleep till <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> on Sunday morning, like a good <foreign>bairn</foreign>. <closer><salute>And God bless thee forever.</salute></closer></p>

<p>&#x201C;With the best intentions always unfortunate&#x201C;&#x2014; I was just putting together my packet yesterday when D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Weber<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Late travelling doctor to the Ashburtons, who are at Salzburg, &#x26;c.&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> came, and staid long enough to belate the whole affair!&#x2014; He seemed bent on <hi rend="italic">coming up to the immense expectations I must have formed of him</hi>&#x2014;and that excessive desire to <hi rend="italic">please</hi> was just what I dislike him for! but he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> clever and gentlemanly and <hi rend="italic">thro going</hi>&#x2014;to appearance&#x2014;at least when looked at <hi rend="italic">in front</hi>&#x2014;for the <hi rend="italic">back</hi> of his head and neck, and all down has a different character&#x2014;much less <hi rend="italic">bred</hi> and less intellectual&#x2014;&#x201C;the human curve&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Mazzini&#x2019;s phrase.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I am here at Scotsbrig for a week past,&#x2014;rather in a poorish condition as to sleep &#x26;c;&#x2014;but I propose being up with you tomorrow (Monday) by way of Gill, and one of the afternoon trains, if my projects prosper. My Mother is to go with me to Gill; there I will leave her and the gig; and come on, most probably by the 5 o&#x2019;clock train (arrives <hi rend="italic">about</hi> 6, I find); and must return, as far as I can at present calculate, on the morrow after.</p>
<p>Jack was at Moffat since the Lamb Fair day; returned yesternight; and had a little letter, seemingly from you. He is for Fife, it appears, in the course of this week. Our poor old Mother is up and down as usual; not worse than you have commonly seen her, but very weak and worn: ah me!&#x2014; At Chelsea all is puddle and uproar; no quiet lodging there for perhaps a couple of months to <pb id="pg-27-228" n="27:228"/>come. Jane is far from <hi rend="italic">wanting</hi> me there; very gleg, happy rather, and very useful surely, but is the farthest in the world from wanting <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and my growlings!&#x2014; I think seriously I must go to Germany, and that forthwith.</p>
<p>Young John, bound for Whinnyrig and his Mother &#x26; Father, is waiting till I end.</p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>If you are still quiet at Bonn, you must now be a little curious to hear of me. I received your Letter at Linlathen in the Dundee region, whither I had fled from Chelsea and the heat;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg had written to Varnhagen from Bonn, <date when="1852-08-04">4 Aug.</date>, mentioning that &#x201C;Our friend Carlyle&#x2019;s trip here is still very uncertain. He is at present in Scotland, from which I expect his decision forthwith. He continues busily occupied with Frederick.&#x201C; He asked Varnhagen if he had seen the copy of TC&#x2019;s portrait in the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi>, which he thought a good likeness, and he approved Mont&#xE9;gut&#x2019;s essay as much as he disliked one &#x201C;in the latest number of the <hi rend="italic">Grenzbote</hi>,&#x201C; also on TC, &#x201C;negative from start to finish,&#x201C; marked by &#x201C;superficial pedantry.&#x201C; He sent some autographs, including one from Louis Blanc, two from Gen. Sir Charles Napier (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19748"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), with Neuberg&#x2019;s comments, and added that &#x201C;The longer English letter is from Mr. George Dawson, a very talented successor and popular apostle of Carlyle, who has attracted much attention as preacher and lecturer. He is an exponent of the &#x2018;young England,&#x2019; in which Carlyle and other ideas are fermenting and bubbling&#x201C; (MS: Jagiellonian Univ., trans.).</note> and ever since, the German problem has been more or less present to me, and pressing for a solution, which, alas, such is the complexity of my position, and such the state of my unfortunate <hi rend="italic">unsleeping</hi> much-enduring <hi rend="italic">nervous-system</hi> above all, I have never yet been able to give it! You shall hear, as exactly as I can describe them, what my <foreign><hi rend="italic">velleities</hi></foreign> [fancies], dubieties and miserable half-resolutions are at this stage of the affair.</p>
<p>First then it has become evident that my Wife cannot, just at present, accompany me to Germany if I go: the carpenters and plasterers require, it seems, continual supervision; are far behind their time; liable to every sort of error and human short-coming: in short she is busy (and even rather happy and successful, she professes) in administering that great affair;&#x2014;and her only anxiety is to keep <hi rend="italic">me</hi> well away from it for two months to come, till which date she does not expect that the house will be perfect again. That is her side of the matter, by the last advices.</p>
<p>As for me I have been kept in continual misery of dyspepsia, loss of sleep &#x26;c &#x26;c ever since I left home; and find too well once more what my instant lot <pb id="pg-27-229" n="27:229"/>is when I quit the little cell that is used to contain me and my set of habitudes: so that all &#x201C;travel,&#x201C; especially all search for amusement in that process, is with reason as terrible to my imagination as it ever used to be! This is my paltry situation,&#x2014;inseparable from the allotment of nerves I have, and too sadly confirmed by every new experiment I make in the matter. Curtainless (perhaps even blanketless) beds; strange diet; incessant noise and hurry: all this is sufficiently horrible to me, in my actual mood above all.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I confess to myself and to you, it is quite shameful to give such way to <hi rend="italic">cowardice;</hi> I perceive that, if I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> now go to Germany (now when I have 2 months or six weeks actually demanding to be spent from home), I shall never again have a chance to go! A small voice of duty furthermore seems to summon me at least to Berlin;&#x2014;as to Silesia and Bohemia, especially in the wild wet weather we now have, the thought seems too audacious; being withal less indispensable, so far as Frederic goes. Nay with regard to F<hi rend="italic">c</hi> himself I must admit, tho&#x2019; my acquaintance with him somewhat ripens, I do not at all feel such a love as will go thro&#x2019; fire and water; in fact I do not in the least yet see what profitable thing I can ever well write of him; and there are other things, to be had with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> travelling, on which one&#x2019;s itch for writing (if it ever arose again, as sometimes seems possible) might exercise itself.&#x2014; In a word, no man can well be in a more <hi rend="italic">ir</hi>resolute state than you perceive I now am!&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the rest, I have ascertained that there goes a Steamer from <hi rend="italic">Leith</hi> (which is within 4 hours of this my native region where I now am) weekly to Rotterdam; every saturday it sails; so that I might spare the 300 miles to London at any rate by such a journey in your direction;&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be in the Rhineland in a week hence, and fairly in the thick of the fight, where perhaps I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> prosper better than my sickly fancy paints; who knows? At any rate, I should be obliged to struggle thro&#x2019;, when once in!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The things <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> for me to see in Germany are, besides Berlin which does not answer till the end of next month, Dresden and the Elbe as high as Schandau (near which is Lowositz, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> battle-place),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lobositz or Lovosice, town in NW Bohemia, where Frederick defeated the Austrians, <date when="1756-10-01">1 Oct. 1756</date>; Schandau, a small town in Saxony, is also on the Elbe.</note> Leipzig, Torgau, Weimar; the Harz also and some glimpses of Hanover would not be unwelcome: but what I <hi rend="italic">need</hi> to do is Berlin and its environs and its libraries, picture-galleries and well-informed persons; this I really should endeavour to compass, or else give up my F<hi rend="italic">c</hi> once for all. As to Schlesien and the Riesengebirge&#x2014;yes that also I <hi rend="italic">should</hi> grudge to renounce; but the difficulties of it seem too heavy for human nature at this juncture!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On the whole, what can I ask you to do for me? If you are still at Bonn, and write in two days after the arrival of this, your Letter will still find me in these <pb id="pg-27-230" n="27:230"/>parts. Your address is, &#x201C;Scotsbrig, Ecclefechan,&#x201C; my Mother&#x2019;s house, whither I return tomorrow: I am here at my sister&#x2019;s only for a day; Scotsbrig will be my abode thenceforth, and is a sure address always. Tell me at least what my route from Rotterdam towards Dresden w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be. Not by the Rhineland at all, I think? But I have not any kind of German map at hand at this moment. And where, supposing I actually landed at Rotterdam about Monday or Tuesday come a week, you and I could meet, if a meeting were at all possible?&#x2014; In short, write to me at any rate; I will not finally decide on anything or stir from my present moorings till I have heard from you again: and my next announcement, I hope, will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be to give up the project altogether, but to announce my intended sail from Leith on Saturday-week, and rendezvous with you somewhere beyond the German Sea. Let us hope so!&#x2014; My Brother is off to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> two days ago; but is to return in the end of this week, and promises to bring at least a Continental Bradshaw<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A railway guide.</note> with him. Tell me anything you may know about Passports at Rotterdam. And excuse this confused Message, written withal amid en<supplied>[d]</supplied>less<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> confusion. <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<p>Hardly time for a word; yet there must be one word lest you get uneasy before <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>,&#x2014;which w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be your first post-day if I did not write till the day after tomorrow,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Tues.</note> the date of my getting back to my Scotsbrig writing case.</p>
<p>We came away hitherward, my Mother and I yesterday; bad weather overtook us, and continues; I left my Mother at Gill, and am here for 24 hours now. Nothing wrong, nothing wrong, my dear little Goody; only the old story, dispiritment, isolation, dyspepsia and want of sleep. Everybody is very kind to me too; I am an unhappy creature!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have written to Neuberg, in the middle of this confusion, a very confused missive, That I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> come away from Leith to Rotterdam on Saturday come a week; that I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to see Berlin, Dresden and some other things but that I <foreign><hi rend="italic">scunner</hi></foreign> and shudder at that and every journey. However, he is to tell me what the particulars from Rotterdam are&#x2014;so far as he can make out from my aims; not an easy problem, I fear.&#x2014; Tell me, thou, a <hi rend="italic">candid</hi> word now about Germany: When <hi rend="italic">could</hi> you go with propriety, leaving nothing like a duty undone <pb id="pg-27-231" n="27:231"/>(not capable of being done by Chalmers &#x26;c) behind you? Say in what length of time. And speak for yourself with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> reference to me and my irresolutions.</p>
<p>It seems to me quite <hi rend="italic">cowardly</hi> that I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give up even the shadow of an Enterprise on Frederic for indigestions, insomnolences and the terror of railway chaos. Absolutely that, like a kind of bayonet in the back, is <hi rend="italic">pushing</hi> me on; to <hi rend="italic">attract</hi> me there is more zero or even a minus quantity.</p>
<p>Jack went off toward Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and Auchtertool on Monday, some hours before my Mother and I left. Poor Helen<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh.</note> is not in a good way, poor little creature, tho&#x2019; not worse than when you heard, perhaps a little better rather: nor do I see the slightest hope of help for her thro&#x2019; what these Doctors say; Jack&#x2019;s notion, however, seemed to me the safe one: to <hi rend="italic">keep off</hi> the need of <hi rend="italic">operation</hi> till the last moment; to depend on regimen &#x26;c as the only real help. Philp the Kirkcaldy Dr, whom I have seen, is a clever kind of man.&#x2014; &#x2014; Aird is very lame here; rather dreary, tho&#x2019; human and friendly. The day is damp, with grey windy scuds of Eastwind rain: I walked far and wide; landed unexpectedly at Woodlands<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >3 mi. NW of Dumfries.</note> at last on the <hi rend="italic">Craigenputtoch</hi> road of all roads in this world! I started in soul as if I had come on something preternatural. O my Jeannie, my poor and ever-dear Jeannie, do not quite cease to love me,&#x2014;do not! <closer><salute>Evermore</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><dateline>Wednesday afternoon / Scotsbrig (as before!)</dateline>
<p>I have now studied Neuberg sufficiently; and send him off that you may understand, more clearly than I could explain in such hurry (3 hours ago), what is to be done about the Passport. Take up the old Passport to Lord Ashburton: my own notion is that it requires only to be <foreign><hi rend="italic">vis&#xE9;</hi></foreign>&#x2019;d by Bunsen and the Austrian Ambassador (one of Bunsen&#x2019;s clerks w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> help you if all else fail): one way or other, I trust to the genius of Goody for having it off to me all ready before half past 5 on Friday Ev<hi rend="italic">g:</hi> &#x201C;Post Office Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>,&#x201C; it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be more consolatory to find it <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, and have no care on that head during the voyage. But I perceive by Neuberg, it will still do even if despatched on Saturday, addressed &#x201C;H&#xF4;tel Pays-Bas, Rotterdam&#x201C; (and <hi rend="italic">paid</hi>, that it may find the better welcome!).&#x2014; From Goody&#x2019;s self I expect a Letter at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> any way.</p>
<p>Lord Ashburton will help you thro&#x2019; the Passport, for love of me, if he can. I have been thinking since of that fine addition to the scheme, of his coming with it himself: really that would be very brave. And he is not <hi rend="italic">due</hi> strictly (at least was not understood to be) till the <date when="1852-09-15">15 Sept<hi rend="italic">r;</hi></date> before which time we c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have a look of Berlin, not to speak of Weimar, Dresden, Torgau and the Saxon Switzerland, together; and send him home a still healthier man! But I fear her <pb id="pg-27-232" n="27:232"/>Ladyship will not consent, nor his Lordship either: more is the pity. (Help that on if you can: for really it will give me pleasure).</p>
<p>I will write again tomorrow; poor wearied soul, there is no rest to thee till I go. Tonight I have to write to Erskine (a farewell), to Jean, to Jamie Austin (ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> money): writing enough.&#x2014;But Jack is off till tomorrow ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, &#x26; there is a heavenly calm: no sound audible but the singing of the Burn; the very poultry and turkeys have retired&#x2014;to the stubbles &#x26; <foreign><hi rend="italic">stooks</hi></foreign>, I doubt  <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest: take care of thyself.&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T.

I was with him for an hour and half before the balloon went off, and not one slightest indication of <hi rend="italic">nervousness</hi> did I see in him&#x2014;nor of excitement from all the notice he had suddenly become the object of. He went about minding his own business talking goodhumouredly with the people who <hi rend="italic">would</hi> talk to him, and when finally he mounted into the air he took off his hat and waved it three times over his head, with a cool courtesy that changed my momentary terror into admiration. My dear woman you may be proud of your son!&#x2014;he will go far yet in science and in distinction or I am no judge of men!&#x2014;</p>
<p>One thing surprised me today and that was, the number of friends he seems to have already made for himself. So many people there both male and female seemed to be personally interested in him. With me he is still so <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> that I hardly hoped others could have so soon found the worth that lies under that reserved manner of his.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-233" n="27:233"/>He meant, if the balloon came down near any railway to return to London tonight, and was to come here, however late the hour to satisfy me of his safety. I am anxiously expecting him, but without fear <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, I was horribly nervous <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the balloon went up but when I saw him in the air overhead, waving his hat with such perfect composure; and saw old Green standing on the <hi rend="italic">edge</hi> of the car, also waving <hi rend="italic">his</hi> hat; as if it were the simplest thing in Nature, my fears grew to look ridiculous to myself.</p>

<p>Last night at home-coming, lay your nice thick Letter (and a very thin one from John) to comfort me along with tea. Tea was welcome, and so I can well say was Goody&#x2019;s letter. If you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been wholly fortunate on Saturday evening at the Post-Office I should have got your news on Monday before going,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> on Sunday, the Agnew Influences,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Followers of Sir Andrew Agnew bart. (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), promoter of Sabbatarian legislation.</note> unknown whence, have interfered here, the Sunday Postman (to let him hear the Gospel ordinances I presume) passes at <hi rend="italic">six a.m.</hi> and neither brings letters nor takes on Sunday! Is not this an exemplary people in the matter of Gospel ordinances if in nothing else?</p>
<p>Jean came down with me yesterday; and is here, lodged in Jack&#x2019;s room till his return which will be tomorrow or next-day: we had a bright beautiful <date when="1852-08-00">August</date> day after the showers of the morning; Cumberland lay clear as in a map, and poor old Annandale looked like a valley of mere Elysium from the top of Repentance Height,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2&#xBD; mi. SW of Ecclefechan.</note>&#x2014;a valley such as it is far enough from proving to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> when one enters it: ah me! However, let us be thankful for the mercies sent; free air, clear water, and a bright sky now and then: these, with poor friends that are true to the last, are surely to be recognised as blessings by the human soul. My poor old Mother, who also had missed sleep &#x26;c, was very cheerful as we drove along: Jean sat on the <hi rend="italic">floor</hi> of the gig (on my carpetbag, laid out at any rate for my Mother&#x2019;s feet); and in the sunny afternoon we did very well. I had bought a tartan dressing-gown (very <hi rend="italic">small red</hi>-hued tartan, in hope of Goody&#x2019;s approval); at which Garthwaite is already working: item six pairs, and also 3 more of a <hi rend="italic">knit</hi> sort, of <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> &#x201C;Shetland-grey&#x201C; socks; 9 pairs in all (was not that gallant?) on which Jean is now employed, <pb id="pg-27-234" n="27:234"/>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">running</hi> heels,<supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied> having done the first job she took. This first job was &#x201C;a Bag for the Shaving things,&#x201C; made of <hi rend="italic">new</hi> moreen; being shocked at the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> aspect of my present one, due to the genius of Goody many years ago. She has made two, one for her husband, perfect counterparts to that model;&#x2014;as for mine, tho&#x2019; I must say nothing, I privately resolve that the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> one (for reasons) shall continue to do duty for some time, and not any new one! She is tolerably happy this poor Jean, and full of spiritual life: Jamie too is really a serious, prosperous and noteworthy burgher;&#x2014;and has for one thing a &#x201C;bath-room&#x201C; of his own furnishing (about the size of our upstairs closet, what the cistern leaves of that), which might go into the Museum! I had shower-baths there (and as much tub-work after as you liked), a perfect niagara of water, and flowing till you <hi rend="italic">stopped</hi> it, such as never fell to my lot before Aird I saw twice; very lame, but not so unhappy as before, indeed not unhappy at all, an entirely solid-hearted pious-minded good rustic man. He said at parting, &#x201C;Tell Mrs Carlyle, I am getting old, am lame too, and have no chance to see her unless she comes here; but if she <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come, say I will <hi rend="italic">steal her a dog</hi> if she bid me!&#x201C;&#x2014; The night before, I had, on constraint, gone to Macdiarmiddom for an hour: very drunk, poor Mac, and very wearisome, tho&#x2019; good; young writer bodies flirting with his two girls, a bright enough room, and the element of whisky there.</p>
<p>You don&#x2019;t tell me enough about the House and your own cares and adventures; and as to Nero there is not a scrape of a pen from him, the villain.</p>
<p>Of course I neither make head nor tail of Chorley&#x2019;s adventure; but perceive only that an evil (Irish) spirit haunts him; and has been walking in your rounds too?&#x2014; Your picture of Weber is correct; to my little experience of him, perfect. Let him stand there with his back to the wall! <closer><salute>God bless thee Goody dear;&#x2014;write.</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name></p>

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>We are all well here this morning; I write you a word, as requested, to the Moffat Post-Office, to say so much, if nothing more.</p>
<p>Thanks for the German details; I believe I shall be <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to go, there seems no honourable getting off from it;&#x2014;Saturday come a week, I must sail, and see the matter to some kind of end! But the outlook of sleepless nights, of wearisome fatiguing dreary days, and toil at once and <foreign>ennui</foreign>, to little visible purpose: all this fills me with a kind of horror. For one thing, however, I may <pb id="pg-27-235" n="27:235"/>take all my luggage with me, provided you <hi rend="italic">bring</hi> a big enough portmanteau. I warmly approved of that project; and would have written sanctioning and encouraging it, had there still been convenience after reading your Letter last night. I will also study to make use of Dr Hunter&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John&#x2019;s friend, Dr. Jacob Hunter of Moffat.</note> services, and be thankful to him for whatever he can do for me. I spoke to Adamson yesterday about money: on that side there is no difficulty, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seem.</p>
<p>We got home yesternight between five and six o&#x2019;clock, in time for a &#x201C;warm cup of tea&#x201C;: Jane and I had left Dumfries in the skirt of a heavy shower, which however promised to be the last, and proved so, the rest of the day growing ever brighter, with fine big spots of cloud-shadow; never did Annandale look better from the top of Repentance Hill. Poor Mary made no complaint about herself; bustled about in hospitable assiduity,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I suppose she is still very far from strong. My Mother had missed sleep the first night, but got better on the next (and even during the day); and was very brisk and lively when we arrived, and thro&#x2019; the journey, as she still is. Jean is lodged in your room,&#x2014;busy at present <hi rend="italic">running</hi> stockings for me. She <hi rend="italic">should</hi> go home, I imagine, for saturday night; but if you come early enough, she can with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the least inconvenience get off to Annan, and home tomorrow (Friday) evening. Probably you will stay a day in Moffat at any rate? You need not do so on her account; but if nothing hurry her I suppose she will not voluntarily lift anchor tomorrow.</p>
<p>Jamie proposes beginning to reap tomorrow. The day is a reaping day; but cold and overclouded, without drought.</p>
<p>A Letter from Jane was here waiting, with various enclosures: all is in <foreign><hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi></foreign> [its existing state] at Chelsea; nothing worse than it was, &#x201C;the sun out again,&#x201C; and the carpenters and plasterers in motion tho&#x2019; at a slow pace. I think I told you I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> written to Neuberg, in a dubitating, not-consenting, yet not-denying tone?&#x2014; <foreign>Ay de mi</foreign>!</p>
<p>I need not write more here at present. <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>By the bye! Is there any such thing to be had in Moffat as about half a square yard (not above <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> inches broad, 5 w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be better) of <hi rend="italic">oiled silk</hi>, supple <hi rend="italic">Mackintosh</hi> cloth, or other texture impervious to water? Jean says oiled silk is on sale in most Apothecaries&#x2019; shops.&#x2014; The case is, <hi rend="italic">both</hi> Isabella and my Mother have taken to &#x201C;compresses,&#x201C;&#x2014;my Mother has borrowed mine this day, and likes it;&#x2014;with the material above-specified, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be quite easy to construct a pair here. Nothing else but perhaps <hi rend="italic">three</hi> yards of very broad tape (&#xBC; inch, not less) are needed; with linen or cotton cloth which the house itself will furnish. Jean suggests this message. See what can be done.</p></ps>

<p><salute>My own dear Goody,&#x2014;</salute>Tho&#x2019; there is no Letter from you today (as indeed was not likely), yet I will not let you front the repose of Sunday without a word from me,&#x2014;a word, tho&#x2019; there be nothing in it. This is again one of the beautifullest still autumn days; I have slept too a little better; and am, for the rest, totally idle, not permitted even to read;&#x2014;so that, had I a right pen and paper (which I have n&#x2019;t), there could be no fitter use to turn me to than seasoning poor Goody&#x2019;s tea on a Saturday evening.</p>
<p>Jack is not come, nor do we hear anything of him; but may confidently expect the appearance of him in person, and the exchange of Jean for him, in the course of tomorrow. He appears to me to have some confused <foreign><hi rend="italic">pluister</hi></foreign> of a marriage or settlement project on foot at Moffat, in which his Mrs Watt is to play a principal part; but I much fear it will come to nothing, as the others have done, poor Jack. In the meanwhile I say or signify absolutely nothing on the matter; and will, with a silent sincere prayer, leave things to ripen towards what issue <hi rend="italic">they</hi> can. But really it is a sad kind of thing to see a man of so many faculties and capabilities leading such a life as his here is: and as to my poor Mother and the other parties interested, I perceive well that some change in the Scotsbrig position of affairs is becoming very desirable.</p>
<p>For these 2 or 3 days Jean has been my principal companion; and certainly she is far preferable to Jack; indeed by much the most ingenious, productive and intelligent human soul I have fallen in with in these parts. A stout heart too she has; and, I doubt not, work for it too, as we all have; but on the whole I account her existence eminently human, and a happy one among mortals as mortals go. For the present she attends me in my longest walks; gives me Dumfries Biographies, and rugged life-like images of practical facts, in the intervals of her extensive miscellaneous questioning about things in general, concerning which too she has unlimited curiosity, and a fine fresh rustic sense. One of her latest anecdotes relates to Macalpine-Leny-dom, and is really very miserable: namely, the eldest daughter of Macalpine,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James McAlpine Leny of Dalswinton House, 6&#xBD; mi. NNW of Dumfries.</note> a fine frank beautiful lass, perhaps about 2 years ago, fell into bad health, health unintelligible to any Doctor about Dalswinton; whereupon the Mother removed with her to Musselburgh,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fishing town 6 mi. E of Edinburgh.</note> to a Sister&#x2019;s, for better advice in that neighbourhood. The Sister, at first sight of her sick Niece, intimated the firm belief that a Doctor could do nothing, that quite other than a Doctor&#x2019;s was the cure <pb id="pg-27-237" n="27:237"/>wanted here! Alas, alas, the poor young woman had to own all; was straightway, not without eagerness and need for it, got married to her father&#x2019;s coachman (hitherto a blackguard as well as coach<hi rend="italic">n</hi>), and bundled off with him, under what emotions may be conceived, to New York and everlasting exile. Poor Leny, of whom I have heard you speak as of a conceited <foreign>gawk</foreign>, but who is now grown a hoary care-worn old man, &#x201C;was like to go out of his wits.&#x201C; Let me add the postscript, however, which is consolatory. The young ruined wife does not give way at New York, but makes valiant fight, it would appear; has &#x201C;set up a school&#x201C;; has taught her coachman various accomplishments, which have got him some kind of clerkship or better trade than mere grooming; and writes lately to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Mother, You may think John has got an idle thriftless wife, but he says sometimes there is not a thriftier or better in New York. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Esperons</hi></foreign> [Let&#x2019;s hope]! This is my bit of human Dramaturgy; for the big Comi-tragedy, with bits of the broadest farce, goes on everywhere and at all times.</p>
<p>My own private perception as to Germany at present is, that I shall <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to go; that I shall actually be shovelled out, tomorrow week, into a Leith Steamer for Rotterdam; a result which I shudder at, but see not how to avoid, with the least remnant of honour! Pity me, pity me&#x2014;I wait, however, for your next Letter, and the candid description of your own capabilities to join me, especially the probable <hi rend="italic">when</hi> of that;&#x2014;and, on the whole, am &#x201C;one coal of burning sulphur,&#x201C; one heap, that is to say, of chaotic miseries, <hi rend="italic">horrors</hi>, sorrows and imbecillities, actually a rather contemptible man. But the ass does swim, I sometimes say, if you fling him fairly into the river; tho&#x2019; he brays lamentably at being flung. Oh my Goody, my own (or <hi rend="italic">not</hi> my own!) dear Goody, is there no help at all then?&#x2014;</p>
<p>My Mother comes in, finds me writing; says send my kind <hi rend="italic">regairds;</hi> tell her I hope she&#x2019;ll get brawly out of her masonries before long.&#x2014;Jean often speaks about you; has evidently still a deep attachment to you, and gratitude (with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> other feeling) in regard to old times.</p>
<p>You now <hi rend="italic">know</hi> (if you will read that Note) what A. Sterling&#x2019;s Address is; and may <hi rend="italic">consider</hi> whether he is worth a Letter. I think he ought to be tamed out of the despairing-shepherd vein, and induced to quit that altogether if he could! A man to whom I really from my heart wish well; and who has rendered it unhandy to me to have the least thing to do with him. At the years of discretion we are now all quite close upon, it were surely good this ended.&#x2014; &#x2014; W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Stirling may stand a chance for John: me he might readily have had from Linlathen, but he did not apply then; and at present such superfluous railwaying and prospects of dreary &#x201C;ornament and grand<hi rend="italic">ther</hi>&#x201C; are not in the game.&#x2014; Did you go to Brookfield and see the ever-teeming Mrs Sartoris?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adelaide Sartoris, b. Kemble (<sic><date when="1814-00-00">1814</date></sic><corr><date when="1815-00-00">1815</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15315"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), singer and author.</note> What of Chorley&#x2019;s Evil Spirit? Still more what of Nero &#x26; the new lean cat? <pb id="pg-27-238" n="27:238"/>Tell me about everything. And about your wicked little self beyond everything: how you sleep, what you do, see, think, and how the campaign proceeds with you. <closer><salute>Oh my poor Jeannie, my best and now one of my oldest Loved Ones, God forever bless thee: That is my constant prayer, spoken &#x26; silent.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Thanks Dear!&#x2014;</salute> I suppose you will have had a packet from me since that note written at Dumfries&#x2014; This will find you returned. I have been waiting all the week for <hi rend="italic">light!</hi>&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan I knew too well &#x201C;had none to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> me.&#x201C; so I have not stormed too much under his non-appearance (for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan has been &#x2018;indulging in a fit of gout&#x2019;&#x2014;so far as I can make it out;&#x2014;and has been moreover for the last ten days &#x201C;down at M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Helps&#x2019;s&#x201C;&#x2014;what doing one would like to know? Perhaps Helps is going to write &#x201C;a wee bookie&#x201C; on <hi rend="italic">Architecture</hi> next, and is using up Morgan as milk cow&#x2014;anyhow, Morgan has not been here for more than a fortnight and if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had not been here to tell the men what was needed, the &#x201C;thorough repair&#x201C; must have been at a stillstand!&#x2014; However&#x2014;as I was saying&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan, in the body would not have thrown much light for me on anything&#x2014;No&#x2014;what I have been crying to <foreign><hi rend="italic">de profundis</hi></foreign> was the Plasterers! If the Plasterers were only out of the house one could <hi rend="italic">calculate</hi> the rest &#x201C;by one&#x2019;s own sharpness.&#x201C; But the Plasterers, promised from day to day, have not returned; and now on sending a special message to &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Townsend&#x201C;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Thomas Townsend, plumber, painter, and glazier, 11 Anderson St., Colville Ter., Chelsea.</note> he tells me what I might as well have been told a week ago&#x2014;that the first coat of plaster will not be dry enough for a week yet to permit of their finishing So much of the fine, drying weather was lost&#x2014; It will take him <hi rend="italic">a week</hi> he says to finish when he once gets begun&#x2014;so that it will certainly be <hi rend="italic">three weeks</hi> from this date before the rubbish is cleared away so that one can <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> to bring back a little order&#x2014; It will hardly be a surprise to you then when I give it as my <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> opinion&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Night</p>
<p>Interrupted by the terrific necessity to upturn that chaotic pile of <hi rend="italic">goods</hi> in the back kitchen, which swept me away into confusion worse confounded<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 2:995.</note> till after posttime&#x2014;&#x2014; As my certain opinion, corroborated by that of Chorley <pb id="pg-27-239" n="27:239"/>and the Painter that our two new rooms cannot be safely <hi rend="italic">papered</hi> this season&#x2014;must wait till spring to bloom up in all their finished loveliness! Well, You must not fret at this delay. <hi rend="italic">Your</hi> room will not look so bad with <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> walls without paper&#x2014;and will be dry enough for <hi rend="italic">inhabiting</hi> thro the winter&#x2014; Only if there be the <hi rend="italic">slightest</hi> particle of damp in the walls it comes out on the paper in yellow stains&#x2014;and should that <hi rend="italic">transpire</hi> &#x201C;one would be vaixed&#x201C;! As for my new bed room, the lying over <hi rend="italic">that</hi> till spring wont be of the slightest consequence&#x2014;as I can continue to sleep in my old room, which has a prospect of getting painted and papered next week. And then the papering when it does come off, with such a good hand as Morgan employs (he has been here one day and entirely contented me) won&#x2019;t take up above a few days, nor make any <hi rend="italic">mess</hi> &#x201C;to speak of&#x201C;&#x2014; If it were all done to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I should be thankful&#x2014;but these Plasterers are as bad as any of the plagues of Egypt, and until <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are fairly out of the house, the painting can&#x2019;t get fallen to with any emphasis&#x2014;and the furniture has to remain in horrid heaps &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">semina rerum non bene junctata</hi></foreign> [atoms of matter not well arranged]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

[<hi rend="italic">Nero is myself!</hi> I am Nero!] I might have told something of <hi rend="italic">him</hi> however rather curious, going down into the kitchen the morning after my return from Sherborne I spoke to the white Cat, in common politeness, and even stroked her; whereon the jealousy of Nero rose to a pitch! he snapped and barked at me, then flew at the cat quite savage. and I &#x201C;felt it my duty&#x201C; to box his ears. He stood a moment as if taking his resolution, then rushed up the kitchenstair and, as it afterwards appeared, out of the House!! for in ten minutes or so a woman came to the door with Master Nero in her arms! and said she had met him running up Cook&#x2019;s Grounds<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510605-JWC-HW-01"><sic>26:84</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1851-06-05">5 June 1851</date></corr></ref>.</note> and was afraid he &#x201C;would go and lose himself&#x201C;!! He would take no notice of <hi rend="italic">me</hi> after for several hours! And yet he had never read &#x201C;George Sand novels,&#x201C; that Dog, or any sort of <hi rend="italic">novels!</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>But of Germany&#x2014;I really would advise you to go&#x2014;not so much for the good of <hi rend="italic">doing it</hi>, but for the good of <hi rend="italic">having done it.</hi> Neuberg is as suitable a guide and companion as poor humanity, imperfect at best, could well afford you. And I also vote for leaving <hi rend="italic">me</hi> out of the question&#x2014; It would be anything but a <hi rend="italic">pleasure</hi> for me to be there, with the notion of a house all at sixes and sevens to come home to&#x2014;and it will evidently take so many weeks yet to <pb id="pg-27-240" n="27:240"/>bring it back to habitable order, that you would probably have done all you had to do and be wishing to come back; by the time I could comfortably go away&#x2014;at all events it would be a most foolish fatigue and expense to go all that way for the week or two I might snatch out of &#x201C;the belly of Chaos&#x201C;&#x2014; You will take me there another time, if you think it worth my seeing&#x2014;or I could go sometime <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> and visit Bolte&#x2014;or I can have money to make any little journey I may fancy&#x2014;some-time&#x2014;when I am out of sorts&#x2014;which thank<hi rend="italic">s</hi> God I am not just now the least in the world&#x2014; If it were not for the thought of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> bother in being kept out of your own house I should not even fret over the slowness of the house-process&#x2014; I can see that there is an immense deal of that sort of invisible work expended on it which you expended on Cromwell&#x2014; The two Carpenters are not <hi rend="italic">quick</hi> certainly, but they are very conscientious and assiduous&#x2014;give themselves a great deal of work that makes no show,&#x2014;but which <hi rend="italic">you</hi> should be the last man to count unnecessary&#x2014;for example when a door is found to have been made all crooked they <hi rend="italic">will not</hi> make <hi rend="italic">their</hi> architrave (is that the way to spell it?) crooked too&#x2014;but insist on bringing the door to straightness by piecing here and plaining off there&#x2014; I said to the oldest man yesterday about some rotten boards in the kitchen, which the painter had pointed out to me, &#x201C;cant you clap up a bit of the old wainscott on <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x2014;just at once <hi rend="italic">in any way?</hi>&#x2014;and he looked at me very humourously and said &#x201C;in any way?&#x2014;Yes!&#x2014;you <hi rend="italic">say</hi> that Mam&#x2014;and you know very well that if we <hi rend="italic">did</hi> it <hi rend="italic">in any way</hi>, you would be saying after; Well! what fellows those Carpenters are! what a job they have had the face to make of <hi rend="italic">this!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;and I couldnt but own he spoke truly&#x2014; When it comes to putting everything in order again it will be a much greater pleasure than going to Germany I can tell you&#x2014; So dont let the notion of my not going be any sort of objection to your own going&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had plenty of other things to tell you but when one gets on that <hi rend="italic">House</hi> there is no end to it&#x2014; John&#x2019;s ascent in the Balloon, which I assisted at, deserved a letter to itself&#x2014; That Boy has things in him that I never dreamt of giving him credit for! I was downright <hi rend="italic">proud</hi> of him that day. Amidst some thirty or forty gentlemen of <hi rend="italic">science</hi> &#x26;c and &#x201C;honourable women not a few,&#x201C; he stood out before me for the first time in his real character, clear, selfpossessed, goodhumoured, inventive; and with nerves of steel, and a power of <hi rend="italic">abstraction</hi> that seemed to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> little short of miraculous&#x2014; With old Green standing on the edge of his balloon shouting to him to make haste, and gentlemen of science pressing round with last questions and suggestions&#x2014;he coolly sat down on his knees before his thermometers, some dozen of them, and examined and wrote down the results in a book, with as steady an eye and hand as if he had been in the Kew Observatory&#x2014; I heard many persons asking one another where he came from, and expressing admiration of his coolness, and prophecying he would &#x201C;come to something&#x201C; &#x201C;his soul was so <pb id="pg-27-241" n="27:241"/>much in his science&#x201C; But he surprised <hi rend="italic">me</hi> most of all when the Balloon had fairly shot up into the air, by taking of his hat, and waving it three times over his head in answer to the cheers below, with a <hi rend="italic">grace</hi> that I stood amazed before as in presence of the Infinite! John&#x2014;so rustic and shy!</p>

<salute>Dear Stirling,</salute>
<p>I should really have been delighted to see you and your beautiful country, which I only glanced at once many years ago: and had your hospitable admonition reached me at Linlathen, or indeed anywhere while time still was, my consent must have been prompt and full of hope! But alas, I go for Germany in five days hence; and have not now either time or spirits for any other <pb id="pg-27-242" n="27:242"/>expedition whatever. In fact it is dire Fate, in a manner, that is <hi rend="italic">driving</hi> me thither; Fate, shame, Necessity, and what is figured as the &#x201C;Call of Duty&#x201C;;&#x2014;and I believe many a gentleman has set out for Botany Bay<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nr. Sydney, New South Wales, a general place name for the destination of convicts deported from Britain; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490507-TC-MAC-01"><sic>24:44</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1849-05-07">7 May 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note> (on Queen&#x2019;s rations) with less reluctance than I now for this briefer adventure beyond the narrow seas. Certainly of all travellers hitherto discovered I am the worst; and therefore not unnaturally the unwillingest.</p>
<p>My Brother has been about Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last week, but is to be here the day after tomorrow; I will not fail to deliver your message, which I think may well prove enticing to him either now or soon.</p>
<p>Give my kind regards to the Captain and Mrs S.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Anthony Sterling (who was touring in Scotland; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521005-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1852-10-05">5</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-10-06">6 Oct.</date></ref>) and his wife.</note> of whose pilgrimings I had already heard something.</p>
<p>You never sent me the Book on Charles V and his cloisters:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521109-TC-WS-01">TC to WS, <date when="1852-11-09">9 Nov.</date></ref></note> I shall be back (let us hope) before your Parliament meet, or you hear the Hebrew stump-orator<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Disraeli.

<salute>My dear Lady Airlie</salute>
<p>I write to you out of &#x201C;the belly of chaos&#x201C;&#x2014; Hence my delay in acknowledging the great boxful of grouse. Had Jonah, in the whale&#x2019;s belly, excellent man as he was, received a boxful of grouse from Lord Airlie, I question if he would have returned his thanks any sooner; and the whale&#x2019;s belly, I am sure, must have been a place of &#x201C;ease with dignity&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><foreign>&#x201C;Cum dignitate otium,&#x201C;</foreign> Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Pro Sestio</hi> xlv, 98.</note> in comparison with this place of mine. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">My</hi> Heavens!&#x201C; (as Lord Ashburton says)&#x2014; Whatever put it in M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s head to get his house what he calls &#x201C;made habitable&#x201C;? And whatever put it in <hi rend="small-caps">my</hi> head to constitute myself presiding genius over such process? For two unblessed months now have Bricklayers, Carpenters, plasterers, painters been tramping in and tramping out here, like &#x201C;soldiers going to, and coming from the thirty years war&#x201C;! I am driven into <hi rend="italic">one end</hi> of the low room, my <hi rend="italic">screen</hi> separating me from piles of beds, and tables and chairs, as if in <pb id="pg-27-243" n="27:243"/>convulsions, with their legs in the air! And then everything gets on <hi rend="italic">so</hi> slowly that it feels like a nightmare dream!&#x2014; But as one of the workmen said to me the other day, &#x201C;You <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have patience <hi rend="italic">dear</hi> Madam indeed you must; it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> all be done&#x2014;sometime!&#x201C; Besides, after all, a little, or even a good deal of <hi rend="italic">material</hi> botheration is not bad for ones soul&#x2014;I would rather have six months of this sort of thing than six hours of <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> botheration. In fact I am not disinclined to believe that I must have been a <hi rend="italic">Builder</hi> in some previous state of existence, or perhaps a <hi rend="italic">beaver;</hi> I find it come so natural to me to live and move in this work&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the rest, there is little to tell you. Hardly any one in London whom you would care to hear about&#x2014; I had a letter from Lady Ashburton the other day announcing her arrival at Bath House next Wednesday, and inviting me to tea&#x2014;also to Addiscombe for a week&#x2014;but I doubt if I can be spared so long from home&#x2014; Lord A is quite well now. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Weber who was abroad with them came here and gave me the most flourishing accounts of them both. Milnes is charming! I saw him in the first blush of his paternity, and he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not have looked more pleased if he had written an Epic taking the shine out of Homer and Milton. Thackeray had his pocket picked of a hundred pounds on a foreign railway!</p>
<p>The most exciting thing that has occurred for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> individually, was seeing the other day a young, remarkably clever cousin of mine go up in Greens Balloon!&#x2014;not for the fun of the thing, but to make observations on the Atmosphere. He went up from Vauxhall in the forenoon in the presence of some thirty or forty men of science &#x26;c and &#x201C;honourable women not a few&#x201C; and I confess I was extremely proud of the impression he made on every one present by his coolness and cleverness. Having never so much as <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> a balloon go up in his life, and having never in his life been the centre of what might be called <hi rend="italic">public</hi> attention he sat down on his knees before his dozen or two of little thermometers, and with Green standing on the edge of the car calling to &#x201C;make haste&#x201C; and scientific Gentlemen pressing him with last questions and suggestions, he examined his thermometers and wrote the results in a book, with as <hi rend="italic">steady</hi> an eye and hand as if he had been in his own Observatory&#x2014; Then; when the balloon had fairly shot up with him into the air, he took off his hat and saluted us all with a <hi rend="italic">calm courtesy</hi> that was beautiful to see! I went home and wrote to his Mother, a widow; whose only son he is, that she might rest assured he would become a great man if he were spared alive. I am going off to dine with one of the best housewives,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. William Fraser, b. Vivian, separated from William Fraser, former barrister and ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review and Continental Miscellany</hi>, who had brought a case in <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> against William Bagley, accusing his own wife of adultery; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440221-TC-JC-01"><sic>17:280</sic><corr>TC to JC, <date when="1844-02-21">21 Feb. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> and most <hi rend="italic">virtuous</hi> <pb id="pg-27-244" n="27:244"/>women in the world who nevertheless once underwent a trial by jury for criminal conduct with an equally virtuous man&#x2014;to see the two people would make you die of laughing with such an idea of romantic impropriety attached to them&#x2014;they were <hi rend="italic">acquitted</hi> of course&#x2014; It was a devilish scheme of the Lady&#x2019;s husband to raise the wind</p>

<p><salute>Dear little Jeannie,&#x2014;</salute>The rain of the afternoon has cleared, or promises to clear; and I will walk to Ecclefechan with a Note to you; better than <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> in the huge idleness that is now around me and in me!</p>
<p>I did not get your Note yesterday; and did not expect it today, having understood that a <hi rend="italic">call</hi> was made at the Post Office, and it was only made at Middlebie, in vain: so about noon today poor Jean came cheerily stepping thro&#x2019; the stubble with your fine thick packet, and a very thin one from John who was still due from Moffat: right g<supplied>[l]</supplied>ad<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> was I to hear of Goody, a day sooner than my disappointment prophesied. Jean is gone since; went away at 4 o&#x2019;clock on a little <foreign>shelty</foreign> to join the train at Annan, and has had rain ever since, poor thing; will be home, however, and at her own fireside, in half an hour now, we hope. John too has come, reporting good news (Helen &#x201C;clearly a little better not very much,&#x201C; your Uncle brisk and well &#x201C;for him&#x201C;): a big portmanteau likewise is here for me, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> ordered yet not unacceptable; for the rest, endless babble and bother; and a companionship decidedly inferior, both intellectually and morally, to Jean&#x2019;s. Heigho! I am very weak myself; overclouded with biliary and all manner of dispiritment; and in fact considerably to be pitied and despised just now. We will surely shake away these unworthy tangles nevertheless; and shall get to stand firmly on our soles, if it please Heaven, by and by, for all that!&#x2014; I awake pretty regularly at six; have not a moment absolutely to myself (for most part) except what I steal; and pass the day in an empty mood of irregular vacancy sorrow and inanity, which is by no means to be commended in a man.</p>
<p>For my German journey I have yet made no preparations; and the day (Saturday first, properly thursday or friday from <hi rend="italic">here</hi>) presses on with an <pb id="pg-27-245" n="27:245"/>odious velocity: all the idle, feeble, and perhaps some of the prudent elements in me cry out, &#x201C;Why go? Seek shelter in some <hi rend="italic">tub</hi> rather, in any solitude where thou couldst <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, where the whole human species would perhaps be pleased to forget the existence of thee!&#x201C;&#x2014; However, I see no way of honourable retreat; I suppose I shall have to go; especially if Neuberg&#x2019;s Letter come with any encouragement in it. My own room at Chelsea, I conclude, is full of paint; no possibility of sleep there; alas, there my cowardice need not look for shelter.&#x2014; Never mind all this dear Goody mine; it is merely the grumbling incidental to dyspepsia and the load of life; it is on the whole the nature of the beast, and must be put up with as the wind and the rain.</p>
<p>My good old Mother is somewhat better than she was at my first coming; she is still cheerful, even quizzical and has glimmerings of the old fun and genial Scotch laughter when her pressures are lightened; but it take<supplied>[s]</supplied> so little to overload her quite, and then the aged soul is bent down to the ground.

<p>all <hi rend="italic">well</hi>&#x2014;a tea-party &#x201C;quite promiscuously&#x201C; in <hi rend="italic">my end of the parlour</hi> on Saturday evening! Kate Sterling come up from Hedley to spend the day with me&#x2014; Edward came for &#x201C;a rough tea&#x201C; and to take Kate home&#x2014; The Reichenbachs sent for to see Kate&#x2014;Saffi <hi rend="italic">ditto</hi>&#x2014;and&#x2014;John Fergus!&#x2014;who walked in on the entirely &#x201C;voluntary principle&#x201C;&#x2014; He had come up the day before and was to go back today&#x2014; We had a quite merry tea in twelve feet square&#x2014;</p>

<p>Another big packet from you; and the description of a jolly tea-party: thanks! The largest package among the enclosures (why not open them?) is an invitation to go out to Wandsworth, and speak on the &#x201C;early-closing movement&#x201C;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To limit the hours worked by shop assistants. Wandsworth is S of the Thames.</note> a very likely speculation for me. Mrs G. Welsh&#x2019;s joy over John is very good and pious; one heartily concedes it to the poor Widow. Chorley I find still more mysterious; but heartily agree with him as to the plan of &#x201C;not writing a word&#x201C; being the proper one: his riddle, I suppose, you will rede [expound] to me in full some day.</p>
<p>A grand Portmanteau has been provided for me, with <foreign>&#xE9;clat</foreign> enough: and a lively correspondence has been set on foot with Dr Hunter (experienced in these things) about passports, foreign monies, Leith Steamers and such promising objects. No word from Neuberg yet; but, turn whither I will, there seems no remedy but going&#x2014;Heaven help me! You are right in your distinction: the pleasure not of doing it, but of having done it may amount to something. &#x201C;Pleasure,&#x201C; God help us!&#x2014; &#x2014; I enclose your two Notes from Lady A<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and will write farther tomorrow,&#x2014;and hear from you I hope? &#x201C;Tea at Bath House on Thursday night&#x201C; is very far from my hand just now: but I must write her Ladyship a little Note explaining how.</p>
<p>Garthwaite the Tailor is making me a pair of Trowsers (for Germany if need be), two ditto of nankeen for a future summer at Chelsea if all go well.</p>
<p>Jean, we incidentally learn, had a kind of accident with her pony yesterday; a girth giving way; and the saddle slipping: as she had gone on to Dumfries, when Jamie junior got to Annan after her, we infer it was not of importance. Poor Jean, I am sorry for the loss of her here; a rational word is not so handy to be had as formerly: and she is very affectionate to me, which is always medicinal to the sick soul of man.</p>
<p>Great harvest-work going on; and one of the furthersomest <date when="1852-08-00">August</date> days,&#x2014;not setting up for quite a beauty of a day, but for utility rather, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is itself very beautiful when men make speed to profit by it. These rugged Annandale shearers ought to put a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kopfh&#xE4;nger</hi></foreign> [low-spirited person] like me to shame! In Germany, whether I <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> or not, the odious captivity to indolence, incompetence and donothingism, which encircles me at present, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be cast off at least. Life anywhere will <hi rend="italic">swallow</hi> a man unless he rise and vigorously try to swallow <hi rend="italic">it.</hi></p>
<p>Nero seems to shine in the amicable passions: his jealousy is fit to equip an <pb id="pg-27-248" n="27:248"/>Othello, if he had dirks, smothering-bolsters, &#x26; the command of Venetian Armies. Is it not beautiful? The little canine heart; the little hairy fourfooted wretch, he had said to himself, &#x201C;It is enough!&#x201C; and taken the world and Cook&#x2019;s Grounds upon him!&#x2014; One raisin to him nevertheless the scoundrel.</p>
<p>Jack bids me say he only got the Macready Note this morning (which is true); and that he judges better to write <hi rend="italic">after</hi> a night&#x2019;s thought, to you and Mr M<hi rend="italic">y.</hi> <closer><salute>Good be with you my little Jeannie.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Sister Jean,&#x2014;</salute>There has a <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> come today with two strokes on it; which is something; but we had hoped to have a small articulate word to assure us of your safe arrival,&#x2014;the rather as you had not a good afternoon at all, and as, moreover, we incidentally heard you had a bit of an accident at Warmanby Gate, the slipping of a girth, if nothing worse. My Mother (who knows nothing of that accident), even she is murmuring that she did not bargain with you for a little word so soon as you arrived. Pray write to us, as briefly as you like, but without delay: one word will do.</p>
<p>I am to go to Germany; there is no help! From Jane I have yet heard nothing farther than you know: but today there has come a highly encouraging Note,&#x2014;in answer to the one I wrote to him<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520817-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1852-08-17">17 Aug.</date></ref></note> from your House;&#x2014;and by this post I must positively intimate that I set out on Saturday morning. Jane, I have no doubt, will approve; for she does not want me there, with things all in such a tumult Neuberg will meet me perhaps about Wednesday or Tuesday next (I hope) somewhere in the Rhine Country; and we will take it very easy, you may be sure enough: and, in three or four weeks, if all go well, I shall expect to be in my own cell at Chelsea again after all these hubblings.</p>
<p>Dear Jean, I am greatly obliged to you for your four days here; more sensible talk &#x26; more honest human affection was manifest in these than in any 4 days I have had this long while. Thanks to you, dear Sister; and long may you prosper as a solid natural <hi rend="italic">Wife</hi> in a time when such are so rare. And think muckle of your man too (for he is a good one), and respect his dainty Bathroom,&#x2014;and give my affectionate regards to him.&#x2014; With Tait,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William Tait (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">67</date>), minister of the Burgher church, Ecclefechan, since <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>.</note> with Garthwaite &#x26; 2 Letters still to write, I never was in such a hurry! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign></salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Jeannie mine!</salute> This morning on awakening, I recollect with a shudder that if I do go off (as all things seem to indicate) on Saturday morning, there will be no time to hear from you in <hi rend="italic">answer</hi> to anything unless I write this day, and by the <hi rend="italic">day</hi> mail not by the night one,&#x2014;so that you may get my word tomorrow <hi rend="italic">morning</hi>, and have time for a reply! Heigho, what tumblings up of the repose of lazy souls: why did I ever venture on the road again at all, even tho&#x2019; Morgan himself were driving me!&#x2014; But to business.</p>
<p>Here there is your House-money, Dearest; I will not have poor Nero and you put to <hi rend="italic">the horn</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proclaimed an outlaw.</note> in my absence,&#x2014;not that at any rate. You write your name on the <hi rend="italic">back</hi> of the Draught, when the time comes; send it to (Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi>) Adamson,&#x2014;bid him make it payable <hi rend="italic">at once</hi> (otherwise he will wait near 3 weeks!) either to yourself, which will cost but little trouble, and is probably the best plan; or to Darwin, or anybody, who can then straightway <hi rend="italic">give</hi> you the cash for it; and so that will end. <hi rend="italic">Only</hi>, mention &#x201C;by return&#x201C; tomorrow that you have got the thing.&#x2014; &#x2014; Secondly, I want 12 pills, your kind from Alsop, in a cut-down flat box; I have at present only 1&#xBD;, and indeed have used just &#xBD; since I came: however, it is best to have them.&#x2014; &#x2014; Thirdly (and lastly) can you look in some of the drawers (small small internal drawers, I think) of the old <hi rend="italic">Desk</hi>-Chest (which used to stand in the Dressing Closet), and find there my <hi rend="italic">French Passport</hi> of last year? Find it if you can (which surely you can without <hi rend="italic">if</hi>), and send it too tomorrow; it may be useful in the uncertainty that reigns in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> as to &#x201C;Lord Provosts&#x201C; giving Passports.&#x2014; <foreign>Ay de mi</foreign>! And this is all; this, I think, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> all. If Neuberg&#x2019;s Letter come today, as it may, I will warn you again today, and you may hear again of me at tea. Time is not very valuable as we spend it here in these days.</p>
<p>Last night, I slept much better; and indeed, except utter dispiritment and indolent confusion there is nothing essential that ails <hi rend="italic">me:</hi> &#x201C;just plain mental awgony in my <foreign>ain</foreign> inside,&#x201C;&#x2014;that is all; which I can in a great measure <hi rend="italic">cure</hi> whenever I like to rise and &#x201C;put my finger in the pipie o&#x2019;t.&#x201C; We have had rain overnight; but the day is again fine, one of the finest, and all hands busy. I find my Fairy-Brae <hi rend="italic">well</hi> has been rained into, and the white of the china cup I stationed there is dimmed with sediment; but the water itself is quite a <hi rend="italic">piece of morality</hi>, and indeed agrees excellently with me, better than most <hi rend="italic">spas</hi> would. Besides I am getting accustomed to the milk-and-meal diet, I suppose; <pb id="pg-27-250" n="27:250"/>and in a couple of months sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be quite &#x201C;water-cured&#x201C; perhaps,&#x2014;had I not to lift my anchor again, and go into <hi rend="italic">new</hi> circumstances once again. Ah me! But courage: in 4 weeks or so I shall have done that German business, I hope; and then, for God&#x2019;s sake, let all vermin, and plastering painting carpentering creatures, be out of my poor bedroom, and let me <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> there indefinitely Jack is going off <hi rend="italic">again</hi> on a Watt-expedition with his gig (or Jamie&#x2019;s) today, and carries this Note: surely something will come of Wattdom? Not much, not very much, I fear! Jack has written to the Macready Doctor and to M<hi rend="italic">y</hi> himself, very particularly I think; recommends Nice or Naples, really not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> likelihood <hi rend="italic">if</hi> poor Mrs. M<hi rend="italic">y</hi> &#x201C;have the requisite strength.&#x201C; I have written a Note to Lady A<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, announcing <hi rend="italic">you</hi> as likely for Thursday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, myself as in all human probability bound for Saxony &#x26; Prussia straightway.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Take care of thy own little self, dear Goody, and God bless thee ever.</salute></closer></p>

<p>In the uttermost haste (for Jack&#x2019;s sacred hour is come), I break up your Note to add one important indispensable thing,&#x2014;about the Passport!</p>
<p>Find that Passport I spoke of; but do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> send it to me: take it to some trusty helpful man (L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Ashburton, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think); ask him in the name of Charity to get <hi rend="italic">it</hi> or a new one constructed for <hi rend="italic">Bohemia</hi> (i.e. Austria) and Prussia (Bunsen by the b&#x2019;ye, if he is in town?

<p>In short, dear Goody, not to throw you all into a flurry, depend on the good Lord Ashburton on Thursday night&#x2014;that really will be best and shortest (if you see no reason of your own which is fairly better); ask his Lordship to <hi rend="italic">act</hi> for you (and Neuberg&#x2019;s Letter will be there then): he will have till <hi rend="italic">Friday&#x2019;s</hi> evening post; I shall still catch it up if addressed &#x201C;Post-Office Edin<hi rend="italic">r.</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;And <hi rend="italic">if</hi> L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> A. w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> cross the seas again, and do a little real German Touring with Neuberg and me, how merry sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I be.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I have got, exactly in the nick of time, your friendly and comfortable letter this day; a great reinforcement and encouragement, for which I owe you many thanks,&#x2014;and an immediate reply, first of all.</p>
<p>Reflexion had taught me gradually after writing that dolorous irresolute <hi rend="italic">Jeremiad</hi>, that on the whole I should have to go; that it was shameful not to go,&#x2014;and in short that I must.</p>
<p>Accordingly things are all in progress, the Passport among others since your Letter came;&#x2014;and if nothing misgo I am to be on board the Leith Steamer on the evening of Saturday first (28<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of the month), &#x201C;some time between 4 &#x26; 8 p.m.&#x201C; (till I hear more exactly), and thereafter in Rotterdam &#x201C;H&#xF4;tel Pays-Bas,&#x201C; as soon as we can. This was already fixed (all but the H&#xF4;tel); and is now, of course, doubly so. How long we take to Rotterdam I do not yet learn,&#x2014;our Steamer <hi rend="italic">calls</hi> nowhere, as some do;&#x2014;I guess perhaps 40 and odd hours; and reckon upon Monday 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, if nothing sinister befal.&#x2014; For the rest, I decide on Bonn, Frankfurt and the Th&#xfc;ringen route; on Bonn, and a little space of rest and consultation before all. If you have a Letter lying for me at the above said H&#xF4;tel (Rotterdam), it will be a comfort on my arrival. I shall likely incline towards the swiftest conveyance up to Coblentz &#x26; your country; yet could rather wish to take the Haag<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Hague, 10 mi. NW of Rotterdam.</note> along with me too. Besides probably all the steamers, for that monday, will be gone before my arrival. Tuesday is my likeliest day of farther advance. I will write to you from Rotterdam if it be possible, whether I find a Letter from you or not. But I do not advise you to come down to Coblentz in search of me, or to stir at all from Bonn till I drop anchor there. Once in the Steamer in the Rhine stream, I shall have nothing to do, but sit silent and smoke,&#x2014;looking out for the Drachenfels,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the Siebengebirge on the Rhine S of Bonn.</note> for Wesel (Castle of Moers will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be visible I know, where Voltaire and F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> first met),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wesel is a city on the Rhine at the mouth of the river Lippe. M&#xF6;rs is a city WNW of Duisburg; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:313&#x2013;14.</note> and best of all for Bonn, and a friend&#x2019;s chair to sit down upon, and do nothing!&#x2014;</p>
<p>As to the Passport, I tore open a Letter to my Wife, and set her to work according to <hi rend="italic">your</hi> better plan: Lord Ashburton, just home from Germany, Darwin &#x26;c are in London, as an <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Foreign-Office Passport of mine is; and I trust to her own <foreign><hi rend="italic">savoir-faire</hi></foreign> for succeeding with such help. At Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or else <pb id="pg-27-252" n="27:252"/>at Rotterdam I hope to find the Passport required: <hi rend="italic">two hours</hi> later, and it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hardly have been possible,&#x2014;the nick of time indeed!</p>
<p>As to money, I will bring a few guineas in my pocket,&#x2014;some kind of negociation with an Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Bank for a &#x201C;circular letter&#x201C; is in danger of <hi rend="italic">failing</hi> for want of time on Saturday:&#x2014;if it do, I will borrow from you, with whom already I have an account,&#x2014;and pay honestly on reaching England!&#x2014; <closer><salute>And so <foreign>Adieu</foreign> for this night. I think there is nothing needful more; and I am in sad haste.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Signor Saffi, by whom this Note will be delivered to you, was Mazzini&#x2019;s Colleague as Triumvir of the Roman Republic; during his exile I have had good opportunities of knowing him; and can, with great readiness and pleasure, bear testimony at all times that he is, what his whole appearance indicates, a man of highly superior character, intelligence and worth. He is distinguished, so far as I can judge, by a <hi rend="italic">singular</hi> clearness of mind; a most modest, courteous ingenuous and veracious man; has a high faculty of intellect too, and tho&#x2019; young, is full of lucid information, scholarship, and good judgement. I have talked with no man from whom I could get such an idea of Italy and things Italian; nay had we a ready <hi rend="italic">language</hi> in common, I believe I might add, have <hi rend="italic">read</hi> no man who could so inform me on those subjects. He is so modest and quiet withal, <hi rend="italic">so</hi> practical and true;&#x2014;and for the rest, tho&#x2019; of course a Republican to the bone, he carries all his opinions with a singular moderation, and utters nothing on any subject at which a man of true liberality, whatever otherwise his creed, could take offence. In short he is a young man for whom I have a great regard and esteem; and to whom all I have known of him has attracted me more and more.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-254" n="27:254"/>It gives me pleasure to hear now that he has thoughts of offering you his assistance in the Westminster;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His &#x201C;Religion in Italy&#x201C; was to appear in the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi>, 60 (<date when="1853-10-00">Oct. 1853</date>):311&#x2013;41.</note> a project which I am pretty certain might, under proper management, turn to account both for you and him. Pray try at any rate; and do not let such an offer go with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> examining it. If you can speak a little French, he is easy to converse with,&#x2014;knows a little English even. All that I have stated above is strictly exact regarding him: on all manner of Italian subjects, literary or political, he might at once or gradually become available.&#x2014; I would recommend, if you can fix on any likely subject, that you should let him write in Italian, or in what language <hi rend="italic">he</hi> feels freest in; after that, a <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> translator (not quite a common phenomenon) aided by a wise editor might surely, one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think, make a handsome business for your readers out of such a man.</p>
<p>On the whole, however, do what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> find advisable: I am anxious to testify nothing that I do not <hi rend="italic">know;</hi> and so will leave you with what is already written. The day after tomorrow I go for Germany, to be back probably in a month; and it will give me great pleasure at my return to find you and Mr Saffi doing some good together.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Mrs Sketchley, a Lady who has already some experience in Literature, and is a person of superior sense, conduct and manners, has now in a state of forwardness a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Religious</hi> Novel,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently never pbd.</note> which she thinks might be suitable to your line of Publishing. I have not myself seen the <hi rend="italic">Ms.;</hi> but my Wife, whose judgement in such things is really good, seems to augur well of it;&#x2014;and on the whole I may safely request and advise you to take a survey of the piece, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to reject except after actual examination.&#x2014; There is no danger of highflown religionism, or bother ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> articles and systems; but there will be, if I mistake not, a true piety of disposition visible, and great acquaintance (grounded on many years&#x2019; experience now) of the world and its ways.</p>
<p>In four or five weeks hence (after a run to Germany, now imminent) I hope <pb id="pg-27-255" n="27:255"/>to be in London again, and to hear good news of you there,&#x2014;and even, if the Powers be propitious, to see you soon.</p>

That one might have had &#x201C;reasonably good time&#x201C; to come and go on!&#x2014; In the old chest of drawers there is not a trace of any passport!&#x2014; You know that I am a good looker, I have looked every drawer thro&#x2019;, great and small, and am ready to be hanged and quartered if any passport be <hi rend="italic">there</hi>&#x2014; I have also looked all the pedestal drawers and the drawers of the writing table&#x2014;and <hi rend="small-caps">getting at</hi> these articles of furniture, and searching them has taken me an hour and half all for nothing!

<p>There has not come the scrape of a pen today, my last day; a thing which greatly surprised and disconcerted me at the first blush of it! Few sadder days have I had in my life; in such a whirlpool of confusions outer and inner: a word of sympathy from Goody w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been very precious,&#x2014;a word on <hi rend="italic">business</hi> even, to let me know you <hi rend="italic">got</hi> the two Letters and were trying! One word to say, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Call</hi>, then, at the Post-Office, Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201C;: I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have travelled all the lighter tomorrow morning. <hi rend="italic">Dreadful</hi> surmises (in my present humour) were not wanting&#x2014;that John Welsh yesterday had met with some accident in his balloon &#x26;c &#x26;c:&#x2014;but these I have waved aside; and will endeavour to help myself along, the best way I can.&#x2014; If there be <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> for me at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, after all? Well, that will be a business! On the whole, never do the like again, if you can help it,&#x2014;when one line of writing is all that is needed. Oh Goody, Goody!</p>
<p>My Packing is done or nearly so: would the day were done, and I away, for it is like to break my heart.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friends who saw TC leave from Ecclefechan station noticed he was surprised at a packet in his pockets. His mother had put some bannocks in it, as she did when he left for Edinburgh as a student, and he was visibly moved. He was not to see her again till she was dying at the end of <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>; see W. H. Wylie, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Carlyle</hi> (<date when="1909-00-00">1909</date>) 21&#x2013;22. TC wrote about their parting in his Journal that it was &#x201C;the crowning point of those unbearable days &#x2026; painful beyond endurance almost, and yet my heart in the inside of it seemed made of stone, as if it could not <hi rend="italic">weep</hi> any more, except perhaps blood. One pays dear for any &#x2018;intellect&#x2019; one may have: it means primary sensibility, which again means injury, pain, misery, from unconscious Nature and conscious and unconscious men &#x2026; painful to bear, however piously you take it.&#x201C;</note> Such a mixture of the Highest and the Lowest, all <pb id="pg-27-257" n="27:257"/>set whirling round one and in one,&#x2014;I never had in quite the same degree before.</p>
<p>Yesternight before sunset I walked solitary to Stockbridge Hill Top,&#x2014;the Burnsward<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Burnswark.</note> <hi rend="italic">made</hi> road; one of the loneliest in all Britain, where you go and come, 3 miles, 10 times with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> meeting a human soul. Strange earnest light lay upon the mountain tops all round, strange clearness, solitude (as if personified) upon the near bare hills,&#x2014;a silence everywhere, as if premonitory of the grand eternal one! I took out y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> letters, and read them over again; but did not get much exhilaration there either. On the whole, I was very sore of heart; and pitied my poor Jeannie heartily for all she suffers, some of it that I can mend and will, some that I cannot so well, and can only try! God bless thee ever, dear Jeannie; that is my hearts prayer, go where I may, do or suffer what I may.</p>

<p><salute>Oh my Dear I should be thankful to know you fairly in the steam boat, &#x201C;all right&#x201C;&#x2014;</salute> I am sitting in momentary expectation of your passport&#x2014; Feeling no certainty that I should find the Ashburtons at tea time yesterday; there having been as yet only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> change on their programme, I made Darwin drive me there before going to the Balloon<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The second ascent, <date when="1852-08-26">26 Aug.</date></note> and learnt from George<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons&#x2019; coachman.</note> that my presentiment was correct&#x2014;a letter had come that morning saying they &#x201C;had not crossed&#x201C; and were not to be looked for till late, if at all last night&#x201C;&#x2014; I went on to see that poor boy off, meaning to drive afterwards to Bunsen&#x2019;s&#x2014;without much hope however of finding <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x2014;but at the Balloon I was addressed by <pb id="pg-27-258" n="27:258"/>Captain Strachey, who thro&#x2019; his brother George<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Strachey (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1912-00-00">1912</date>), second son of TC&#x2019;s old friends Edward and Julia Strachey (see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220112-TC-JCE-01"><sic>2:4&#x2013;5</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1822-01-12">12 Jan. 1822</date></corr></ref>), army engineer in the East India Co., explorer of the Himalayas, home since <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>. George Strachey (<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1912-00-00">1912</date>), sixth and youngest son of the Stracheys, officer in the foreign service.</note> in the Foreign Office undertook to manage the thing for me in a correct manner and before post time today&#x2014; It might be necessary, he said, to forge your signature so I gave them a piece of your letter to copy from&#x2014; It is now half after three and Capt Strachey is not come yet&#x2014;surely he will come! But if, in spite of his solemn assurance given in full knowledge of the haste required, this passport should not come in time for todays post to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> it shall still meet you at Rotterdam or <hi rend="italic">a</hi> passport shall meet you there&#x2014; I rushed up to Bath house this morning at ten&#x2014;and found they <hi rend="italic">had</hi> arrived last night at eleven&#x2014; if Strachey failed today, which Lord A considered &#x201C;impossible&#x201C; he would do the needful for me tomorrow&#x2014; But I wish to Heaven Strachey may come&#x2014;I am as nervous and flurriable as yourself today&#x2014;Had little sleep last night&#x2014;thro expecting that boy down from the skies&#x2014; At one in the morning a telegraph Despatch came from him (<hi rend="italic">at the public expense</hi>) But the awful double-knock at one in the morning, and the hollow-voiced man in green who presented the letter, and the evasion of Nero who full of sleep thought it was M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Piper come for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> and went off with the Telegraph Man without my noticing&#x2014;and only returned after I had come down stairs and unbarred the door for the second time and whistled some ten minutes in the streets! All that was not a good preparation for a nights rest&#x2014;</p>
<p>Both Lord and Lady A looked quite well&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">showed</hi> him your great desire to have him with you&#x2014;and he answered politely he would like it &#x26;c but without an idea of going&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was to go back in the evening, but shall not, unless it is necessary to go about the passport for they are tumbling all the things out of my bedroom&#x2014;and I must go to Hemus Terrace to sleep&#x2014;and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Thorburn has not been warned yet!</p>
<p>And Fanny<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Irish maid.</note> too comes tonight and I am busy and fussed to death and not at all <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> visiting!&#x2014;</p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>Oh if Strachey <hi rend="italic">would</hi> come!</p>
<p>It is ten minutes past four and no Capt Strachey it is just possible he may for want of time be sending the thing off himself I told him to do <hi rend="italic">that</hi> if run to the last moment by delays&#x2014;but he should have sent to warn me&#x2014; I must send this off not to miss the post myself&#x2014; I shall then go in search of Capt Strachey&#x2014;(happily I took his address)&#x2014;the Foreign Office will be closed I <pb id="pg-27-259" n="27:259"/>fear&#x2014;and having ascertained what he has done or not done I will then go after Lord Ashburton&#x2014; So that if no passport is at the Post Office Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> you may certainly expect it at Rotterdam</p>

<salute>My dear John</salute>
<p>The Devil has been busy in the postoffice department last week&#x2014;letters arriving here at unprecedented hours, and arriving <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, not at all it would seem&#x2014; I have a letter from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C complaining bitterly that I had not written to him before starting&#x2014;in reply to a letter received on Thursday morning, about his passport, pills, &#x26;c&#x2014;that letter I answered <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi> and saw with my own eyes Darwins John<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A servant.</note> put the answer into the Sloan Street Post office at 2 oclock. and I strictly enjoined Alsop, who is punctuality&#x2019;s self to have his pills in the post office befor four. How M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C should have missed getting my letter I can&#x2019;t imagine&#x2014;enclosed in it was a hurried note to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> about little Oscar Reichenbach who is ill of hooping cough, and getting so weak that his Parents are dreadfully alarmed about him&#x2014; It is much to be wished that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C <hi rend="italic">could</hi> learn not to leave everything to the last moment&#x2014;throwing everybody about him as well as himself into the most needless flurry. I am made quite ill with that passport&#x2014;had to gallop about in street cabs (<hi rend="italic">by the hour</hi>) like a mad woman&#x2014;and lost two <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> nights sleep in consequence, the first from anxiety the second from over fatigue</p>
<p>Here is your letter come, to cut short more &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">details</hi>&#x201C; which else I might have got &#x201C;intangled&#x201C; in&#x2014;a note from D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Hunter by the first post had already put me at rest as to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C having got the passport and the letter I sent to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014; Oh no! not <hi rend="italic">too late here</hi>&#x2014; As I have told you I saw the letter put in the post office at <hi rend="italic">2</hi> in the fore noon&#x2014;the pills I cannot answer for&#x2014;there is only the <hi rend="italic">probability</hi> founded on my experience of Alsop&#x2019;s correctness&#x2014;that that also was posted soon enough&#x2014; I wrote to Rotterdam on Saturday&#x2014;in case he should inquire for letters there&#x2014;</p>
<p>My bed was pulled down (it had long been standing &#x201C;a complete wreck&#x201C; in the middle of a room <hi rend="italic">laid waste</hi> last Saturday&#x2014; And in consequence of the <pb id="pg-27-260" n="27:260"/>passport I could not get to seek myself a place to lay my head till nightfall&#x2014; So I tried then the nearest place I knew of, and tumbled into a small room at 2 Cheyne Walk<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Address of Frederick Battcock; Battcock &#x26; Drouet, coal merchants was at 1 Cheyne Walk.</note> where a Baron Dalwig a friend of the Reichenbachs had lodged&#x2014;not having been able to ascertain whether the passport had really been sent off in time for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I could not of course sleep a wink in the new position&#x2014;and felt such <hi rend="italic">terror</hi> of that bed again that next night I sent Fanny to sleep in it and myself slept all alone in this house on the sofa where Fanny had slept&#x2014; the kitchen being quite reeking with paint&#x2014; And last night I tried the same wretched position But today I must go and see if M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Thorburns<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Hemus Ter.; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510329-TC-JAC-01"><sic>26:52</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1851-03-29">29 March 1851</date></corr></ref>.</note> white washing is over&#x2014;at all events I must sleep this night <hi rend="italic">in a bed</hi>&#x2014;somewhere</p>
<p>Mrs Macready is at Plymouth Forster told me yesterday&#x2014;stood the journey better than was anticipated but the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> there gives no hopes of her&#x2014; Oh no! one has only to look at her to feel that there is no hope!</p>
<p>I wonder now if you will break down in that enterprize?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">please</hi> dont, I want very much to see you comfortably settled in life&#x2014;and with a woman of that age&#x2014;whom you have known for 15 years I should not feel any apprehensions about your doing well together But you put so little <hi rend="italic">emphasis</hi> into your love making&#x2014;that it wont surprise me if this one too get out of patience and slip away from you</p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I did not arrive here till today (Tuesday) at noon; my time I had kept, but the Leith Steamer did not start for 10 hours or more, and then made a dreary tossing, tumbling and indeed quite sad voyage of it. So that your letter here, like the voice of friendly welcome, was peculiarly acceptable to me. I have had little sleep for 3 days, little food that could be eaten,&#x2014;am in fact in a state not of victorious feeling at all just now!</p>
<p>Amsterdam &#x26; Arnheim I had already thought of; but after inquiring here in the insoluble imbroglio of Bradshaws and other way bills, and computing my own strength of spirits for such enterprizes, I decide for the <hi rend="italic">briefest method.</hi> Tomorrow (Wednesday) morning at 6, I mean to start by the D&#xfc;sseldorf Steamer: I will take my passage all the way to D&#xfc;sseldorf, but with liberty to <hi rend="italic">stop</hi> for the night when I have had enough: next day by such steamer as suits for the <hi rend="italic">trains</hi> towards Bonn, I will <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> the D&#xfc;sseldorf part of the business; and I think take <hi rend="italic">the rail</hi> for the rest of the way to Bonn, being completely sick of steamers for the present. If all go right, therefore, I ought to get to you sometime on Thursday,&#x2014;but by what train I cannot in the least say; being indeed quite dark as to trains or times and tired of asking in this Babylonish dialect: but I think I may say safely it will be <hi rend="italic">latish</hi> in the day; and for the rest, you are not to heed me till I do arrive: now that I know your N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> and street, I can at once find you whenever it may be.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, therefore; and prepare to see a man like poor old Pope Pius VII, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Re&#x26;ccedil;u un Pape en assez mauvais &#xE9;tat.</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Received: one Pope in bad enough condition&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440625-JWC-TC-01"><sic>18:82</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1844-06-25">25 June 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Hoping to meet soon, Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<p>Dr Hunter, I hope, wrote to you; and ended your tremors to some degree on monday morning: Passport &#x26;c were perfectly exact to time (thanks for my poor little creature&#x2019;s ingenuity and diligence on that occasion): at (not 4 p.m. of Saturday but 1 a.m. of Sunday I did get on board the greasy little wretch of a Leith Steamer (laden to the waters-edge with pig iron and herrings), and till this day at noon she has had me at what Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s dog-doctor calls &#x201C;tub practice&#x201C;: <foreign>ach Gott in Himmel</foreign>!&#x2014; But we did get out at noon (tho&#x2019; not till now 7 p.m. could I get my things out of the Customhouse, to write to thee); I found a Letter from Neuberg, I have lain on chairs, I have strolled about (in weakness &#x26;c &#x26;c): finally I have dined, and my things are come; and I sit upstairs, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> story, in a clean little bedroom with beautiful rearward aspects&#x2014;and hope I shall sleep till tomorrow morning at 6.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Take this shortest of Letters, to save my poor Mother from her anxieties! I have not time to write except a word to Neuberg, Jane &#x26; you;&#x2014;the minutes are nearly all gone now.</p>
<p>Dr Hunter wrote, I doubt not: he was the kindest of men to me, and did me real service and help,&#x2014;that was his <hi rend="italic">revenge</hi> for my impatience with him the night before!</p>
<p>Our voyage lasted instead of 36 hours as you guessed upwards of 80,&#x2014;namely till this morning at noon (Tuesday 7 p.m. is the date now); one of the most uncomfortable pitching, tumbling tedious &#x26; dreary voyages I ever made. However, it is all well over now, and I hope to get asleep in this fine clean inn tonight, and have already had some Christian dinner:&#x2014;and tomorrow morning at 6, I take the Dusseldorf Steamer; sleep somewhere (<hi rend="italic">anywhere</hi> I have the choice) on the road; and next day on arriving at Dusseldorf, take the rail to Bonn, and so arrive there <hi rend="italic">thursday.</hi> I have written so to Neuberg, whose Street &#x26; N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> I now have. That is hitherto my history.&#x2014; Write you thither; if you have not already written. Oh be good to my dear old Mother, oh be kind to her among you! Tell her now to be at rest about <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> for I have got the ugly part of my adventure over. <closer><salute>And tell them all, Jamie Isabella &#x26; yourself, to forgive me my glooms and perversities, and to believe in my affection. Send Jean word too. And so God bless you all.&#x2014; Ever</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>A letter from you at last, Dear;</salute> whereby it would seem you are &#x201C;as well as could be expected.&#x201C; By this time you will be in the arms of Neuberg, God grant! and one need feel less anxious about you&#x2014; You would <hi rend="italic">find</hi> no letter from <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at Bonn&#x2014;one was aimed at Rotterdam which you do not seem to have got&#x2014;in fact &#x201C;the Destinies&#x201C; have not been auspicious to my writing latterly&#x2014;your last letter to me from Scotsbrig was a protest against my negligence. not merited I assure you&#x2014; I do wrong things by the dozen, but to <hi rend="italic">not</hi> write when expressly desired <hi rend="small-caps">to</hi>, and when there was <hi rend="italic">business</hi> in question, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is a sort of wrong thing not the least in my line! Your letter containing the bill and asking for pills and your passport was answered within a few hours. I put it myself, that is to say, I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> Darwin&#x2019;s John put it in the Sloan Street post office a few minutes after two o&#x2019;clock. My first intention was to leave it at Alsops to have the pills tied up with it&#x2014;and then I decided for greater certainty to put <hi rend="italic">it</hi> in the post office and leave <hi rend="italic">them</hi> only the pills to post&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi> the address for the pills and they undertook solemnly to post them in time and swear that they <hi rend="italic">did</hi>&#x2014;and I have never in my life experienced any want of punctuality in that shop&#x2014;so the delay must have lain in some post office&#x2014; If you have not got my Rotterdam letter (directed Hotel Pays Bas posted on Saturday) you will not have the rest of the passport brain fever&#x2014;but no matter, since you <hi rend="italic">got</hi> it all right&#x2014; I told Lady Ashburton &#x201C;care of Joseph Neuberg Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Bonn&#x201C; would find you so if you have not got her packet enquire&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;but alas! I have no more particular address for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> to make <hi rend="italic">it</hi> any surer to reach you&#x2014; I have a new invitation to go to Addiscombe tomorrow (Friday) and stay till Monday (Lord A being gone to Scotland <hi rend="italic">quite promiscuously</hi> and her Ladyship in consequence going a second time to Addiscombe) I accepted; being very anxious to have a christian bed for a night or two having alternated for a week betwixt the sofa in this room, and the bed at 2 Cheyne Walk&#x2014;on the same principle that Darwin frequents <hi rend="italic">two</hi> clubs&#x2014; In my <hi rend="italic">lodging</hi> I am devoured by <hi rend="small-caps">bugs</hi>!&#x2014;(and I suppose all <hi rend="italic">lodgings</hi> would be the same in that respect) and here it is <hi rend="italic">too</hi> wretched!&#x2014; But last night Lady A sent me word by Fanny who had taken her up the cranberry jam promised long ago that it was possible she might not go till Saturday&#x2014;in fact till I am on the road I needn&#x2019;t make myself sure of going at all!

<p><salute>Thank thee very much, dear Jeannie, for the Letter of yesterday;</salute> which lay waiting to refresh me, in the afternoon, when I returned from my dusty labours in the Library here! It seemed to me the kindest I had got from you in this long while, almost like the old ones I used to get; and any Letter at all, so anxious and impatient had I grown, would have been right welcome. Be comforted, my poor little Goody; there has nothing gone wrong here; neither at Chelsea will these confusions last forever: I shall get my journeyings done, better or worse; the weary Morgan also will end; and by Heaven&#x2019;s blessing we shall get into our own little crypt again (where the human body can at least <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>), and if we are wise, we will stay there, I think!&#x2014; But in truth, I ought rather to thank the Fates, I believe, than complain of them; for except the botherations and failures of sleep &#x26;c my journey has had nothing that was not pleasant and lucky hitherto. &#x201C;Forward, forward!&#x201C; that is the word; and Oh cease not to <hi rend="italic">spur</hi> that lazy ass we have for Builder in Cheyne Row;&#x2014;and get by some method or other the upper bedroom ready; where at least one&#x2019;s imagination beyond seas may solace itself with thinking of possible quiet, where, in practical fact, poor Goody herself may get a little Christian sleep, free from &#x201C;foul creatures&#x201C; and foreign Numbers 2.&#x2014; &#x2014; Alas, alas, I am losing my eyesight (sad symptom of bile) by stooping over this flat table; and must without circumbendibus write briefly what is indispensable.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-267" n="27:267"/>I hoped Jack had fully explained how I <hi rend="italic">found</hi> your missing letter next morning at Ecclefechan, and what a load of care it at once took from me: I perceived clearly <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had done whatever was punctual and right in the affair. Alsop&#x2019;s pills unfortunately did not even then present themselves; only came next day, and now will never reach me at all: a circumstance wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> John, writing to Neuberg, treats as perfectly indiff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> (there being &#x201C;plenty of medicines in Germany&#x201C;), tho&#x2019; to me it would have been handier otherwise!&#x2014; However, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> could do no more; and all that was essential is successfully <hi rend="italic">done.</hi> I wrote yesternight to Rotterdam for your other letter; and expect it the day after tomorrow. At Bonn here on my arrival there lay nothing for me except this Note from Lady Ashburton, enclosing the introduct<hi rend="italic">n</hi> from L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> A. to the Ambassador at Berlin,&#x2014;not a first-rate comfort to me! I must &#x26; should acknowledge it today, if I can; but writing of all kinds in these sad biliary circumstances, with half-blind eyes, and stooping over low ricketty tables, is perfectly unpleasant to me. Not to mention that I hardly know what it is I am writing; and in short, cannot be expected to like such a job. Heigho!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Well, but let me say I got beautifully up the Rhine; stuck by the river all day, all night; and, the next afternoon (the second after I had written to you), found Neuberg waiting here on the beach from<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> me, and so got fairly out. Alas, at Rotterdam I had slept simply none at all, such was the force of noisy nocturnal travellers, neighbours <hi rend="italic">snoring</hi>, and the most industrious <hi rend="italic">cocks</hi> I ever heard! The Customhouse Officers too had spoiled the look of my portmanteau (which is now mended, better than ever), and on the whole I was in such a whirl of stormtost fluries<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> and confusions:&#x2014;God help me, wretched thinskinned mortal that I am, at 5 a.m. next morning I was in a precious humour to rise, and settle with unintelligible waiters, and German steamboat clerks, and get myself on any terms on board. On board I got, however; and the place proved infinitely better than I hoped; some approach to Christian food to be had in it, some real sleep even,&#x2014;indeed the principal sleep I have <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> had since friday gone a-week was 4 hours and again 4 hours, deep, deep, lying on the cabin sofas, amid the general noises, in that respectable vessel. I spoke German too, being the one English<hi rend="italic">n</hi> on board; made agreeable acquaintances; one really nice Gr&#xF6;ningen gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, acquainted with England, who solemnly took leave of me, with a &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Stet in memori&#xe2;</hi></foreign>&#x201C; [keep in memory] after our six hours of good companionship.&#x2014; The Rhine, of a vile reddish drab colour, and all cut into a reticulary work of branches, flowing thro&#x2019; an absolutely flat country <hi rend="italic">lower</hi> than itself, was far from &#x201C;beautiful&#x201C;: about Rotterdam, and for a 50 miles higher; but it was highly curious and worth seeing once and away. A country covered with willows, bulrushes and wet woods; kept from <pb id="pg-27-268" n="27:268"/>drowning by windmill pumps: one looked with astonish<hi rend="italic">t</hi> upon it, and with admiration at the invincible industry of man. Higher up (towards 4 p. m. of the first day) the river gets decidedly agreeable; and about Cologne 20 miles below this, a beautiful mountain-group (<hi rend="italic">Sieben-gebirge</hi>, &#x201C;the 7 hills,&#x201C; see Neuberg&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">cross</hi>),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., on a map.</note> which is still some 5 or 7 miles beyond us <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, announces that the &#x201C;Picturesque&#x201C; is just going to enter on the scene,&#x2014;much good may it do us! We had beautiful weather all the way, and yet have; but surely the most picturesque of all objects was that of Neuberg standing on the beach here, to take me out of all that puddle of foreign things, and put me down (as I hoped) in some place where I might sleep and do nothing else for several days to come.&#x2014; Neuberg&#x2019;s kindness nothing can exceed; but as to the rest of it&#x2014;as to sleep in particular, I find the hope to have been some what premature. Oh Heavens, I wonder if the Devil anywhere else ever contrived such beds and bedrooms as these same are! And 2 Cocks are industrious day and night under the back window; and I have had to shift into the front room wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> looks out upon the highway&#x2014; But upon the whole, I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> slept everynight here, more or less, and am decidedly learning to do it; and Neuberg asserts that I shall become expert by and by. The grand thing is, to get my journey <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, now that I am on it; a second journey, I trust, is not likely to follow soon.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as my first day&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, I went to the University Library here; found very many good books, unknown to me hitherto, on Vater Fritz; took down the titles of what, on inspection, promised to be useful; brought some 20 away with me,&#x2014;and the plan at present is, that N. and I shall go with these to a rural place in these Siebengebirge, called Roland&#x2019;s Eck for one week, where sleep is much more possible, and then examine my 20 Books before going farther, and consider what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the best to be done farther. We go to look at it this day sunday at 2 o&#x2019;clock,&#x2014;an hour hence, <foreign><hi rend="italic">ay de mi!</hi></foreign> The good Neuberg is meantime out towards Bonn,&#x2014;to try for some <hi rend="italic">pills</hi> to me (at a venture)! This &#x201C;Coblenzer-Strasse&#x201C; of his is not a street <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the town at all but a row of scattered houses, built along half a mile of straight flat road leading to <hi rend="italic">Coblenz</hi>, eastward and upward along the river,&#x2014;the Coblenz <hi rend="italic">road</hi>, in fact. Not nearly so nice as Comely Bank or Morningside;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Edinburgh; the Carlyles had first lived at Comely Bank, and JWC&#x2019;s paternal aunts moved to Morningside about <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>.</note> more like the <hi rend="italic">level</hi> coach-road at Malvern: may <hi rend="italic">I</hi> soon take leave of it, for a quieter region! Poor N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> with his Sister has only a furnished floor in the house, and that none of the best. But it is impossible for man to be kinder and that covers all kinds of things.</p>
<p>Dearest, Dearest, did you ever read such a Letter in your life! Our place of <pb id="pg-27-269" n="27:269"/>address is still Herrn Joseph Neuberg zu Bonn;&#x2014;and n.b. the C.

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>Your Letter lay waiting me here, a thousand thanks for such a kindness: it was the only English word I had heard since quitting England, and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been welcome, had it come from a far inferior hand. The Berlin <foreign><hi rend="italic">Empfehlungschreiben</hi></foreign> [letter of introduction] shall do me good service in its season, I hope;&#x2014;of which you shall duly hear.</p>
<p>I meant to write to you deliberately yesterday; but literally couldn&#x2019;t: so sickly hurried and indeed half-distracted was I,&#x2014;on the road to Rolandseck, on the road to I know not where: ah me, at Rolandseck I got little except the view of the Drachenfels and much disgust superadded: but to write to my Lady there was no time. Nor today have I above <hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> counted minutes: but these I use rather than wait longer.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have been, and still am, as you predicted, dreadfully off for <hi rend="italic">sleep;</hi> otherwise well, and the country and River pleasant to me, and the people all good. But for the rest&#x2014;&#x2014;!</p>
<p>Our next place of repose I judge is likeliest to be Homburg where you were. &#x201C;Frankfurt a. Mayn Poste restante&#x201C;; that is the address for an 8 days hence, if you will be good to me.

<dateline>Tuesday night [<date when="1852-09-07">7 September 1852</date>]</dateline>
<p>When I returned from Addiscombe yesterday forenoon I saw a letter on the table and cut short poor Nero&#x2019;s vehement leaping, to take it; and lo! it was my own letter from Rotterdam! addressed to the &#x201C;London Library St James&#x2019;s Square&#x201C;! a fact which puzzled me extremely, &#x201C;An old man&#x201C; had brought it from there, and said &#x201C;a shilling had been paid for it&#x201C;&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> shilling the unlucky deed had cost! By and by I noticed that the envelope had the London Library mark on it, and then the small mystery was solved. I had written the letter at the L<hi rend="italic">n</hi> L<hi rend="italic">y</hi> after some hours of wild galloping in a street cab to ascertain about the passport&#x2014;indeed that passport affair was as pretty a version of <hi rend="italic">Simon Brodie&#x2019;s Cow</hi> as any I have lately had on hand!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >When Simon Brodie had done all he could to find a lost cow, &#x201C;The cow cam hame and her tail behind her&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510914-JWC-TC-01"><sic>26:174</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1851-09-14">14 Sept. 1851</date></corr></ref>.</note> Today I have to thank you for a letter more agreeable to receive than that one&#x2014;as you have not got &#x2018;stolen or strayed&#x2019; hitherto one may <hi rend="italic">now</hi> feel a moderate assurance that you will be safely landed at the far end of this journey to&#x2014;what shall I say?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Flaetz!</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Fl&#xE4;tz (Jean Paul&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Schmeltz</hi>)&#x201C; (note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>); see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 22:131&#x2013;92.</note> Neuberg being not likely either to lose sight of you or to lose patience with you.</p>

I was engaged to tea at the Farrer&#x2019;s tonight, but a note came from Annie to say that her Mother was lying ill with a blister on her back, and her sister brought home from a visit she had been making, with her <hi rend="italic">nose broken</hi> and otherwise all <hi rend="italic">smashed</hi> by a dreadful fall!&#x2014;poor girl! I saw her the day before I went to Addiscombe looking so pretty! (Thursday morning)</p>
<p>At this point I stopt on Tuesday night the thunder and rain becoming too loud &#x201C;for anything&#x201C; it was still raining violently when I went to bed, (&#x2014;in your room&#x2014;the bed up&#x2014;for the rest, carpetless and full of lumber&#x2014;) so I left only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the windows open; and what with the paint smell, and the fatigue of having nailed up all the hangings myself, and the want of sleep at No 2 and at Addiscombe I took quite ill in the middle of the night, colic and <hi rend="italic">such</hi> headach! in the morning I crawled down to the sofa in the parlour, and lay there all day, till eleven at night, in desperate agony, with a noise going on around me like the crash of doom.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Oh, heavens! How can I endure all that?&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> If it had not been for Fanny&#x2019;s kindness,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Fanny is &#x2018;Irish Fanny,&#x2019; whom I recollect well; she was by nature a very good girl (and got full generously treated here, even to the saving of her life, I might say), and she did well for a year or more; but after that sank to the common level or below it, and had to disappear like the others&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> who when all else that she could try failed, fairly took to crying and sobbing over me, I think I must have died of the very <hi rend="italic">horror</hi> and <hi rend="italic">desolation</hi> of the thing, for the Plasterers came back yesterday to finish the cornice in the new room, and the bricklayers were tramping out and in repairing the backyard and the Painter was making a rare smell of <hi rend="italic">new</hi> paint in my old bedroom&#x2014; Besides the two carpenters into whose heads the Devil put it to <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> the whole day at god knows what, without a moments intermission, except to <hi rend="italic">hammer!</hi> I have passed a good many bad days in this world but certainly never one so utterly <pb id="pg-27-272" n="27:272"/>wretched from mere physical and material causes as yesterday!&#x2014; It is over now however, that bout! and I should be thankful to have held out so long. In the evening came a note which I was not up to looking at till some hours after&#x2014;when lo! it was a few hurry-scurry lines from John, to say that he and &#x201C;the Baing&#x201C; were actually engaged! they were all well, I was to tell you, and had got your letter. no newspaper reached me except the Athenaeum which I supposed had been overlooked at Scotsbrig I hope poor John is &#x201C;making a good thing of it&#x201C; the &#x201C;parties&#x201C; having known each other for fifteen years it is possible they maynt be marrying on a basis of fiction&#x2014; Reflecting with a half-tragical, half comical feeling that John was just my own age, I turned to another letter still lying unopened, and found what might have been a proposal of marriage to&#x2014;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">myself!</hi> had you not been alive at Bonn! A man who having wished to marry me at fifteen, and &#x201C;with the best intentions proved unfortunate,&#x201C; and whom I had seen but <hi rend="italic">once</hi> these twenty years, now &#x201C;thought himself sufficiently master of his emotions, to dare to tell me that for nearly <hi rend="italic">40</hi> years (!) he had loved me with the same worship-ful love&#x2014;me the only human soul who ever possessed the key to his locked heart&#x201C;!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was John Riddle Stodart.</note> And they say <hi rend="italic">Man</hi> is an inconstant animal! Poor Fellow! I am afraid he must be going to die&#x2014;or to go mad, or he would have continued to pursue the silent system which use must have rendered easy to him. The practical inference from all this, and a good deal more I could instance, is that the laws of nature in the matter of Love seem decidedly to be getting themselves newmade; &#x201C;the bloom&#x201C; not to be so &#x201C;speedily swept from the cheek of that beautiful enthusiasm&#x201C;!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Beautiful enthusiasm.&#x2019;&#x2014;Foolish, inflated English lady, of the elderly governess kind, who once came to us at Craigenputtock (where we had little need of her), spoke much to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> of a &#x2018;Ba-ing I could love,&#x2019; &#x2018;Brush the down from the cheek of,&#x2019; &#x26;c. T.C.&#x201C; (Note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>You may calculate on having your bed room quite ready&#x2014;and the new room in a cleaned out state&#x2014;not papered&#x2014;but really <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is easily to be born after what has been to bear&#x2014; The door in the parlour has been left as it was&#x2014;partly because I dreaded to let the wretches begin any new <hi rend="italic">mess</hi> and partly because I find the room can be made so warm for winter, by having the door opened into the passage and the folding door space completely filled by the screen. Now that I see a probable end to the carpenters and bricklayers&#x2014;I may tell you without putting you quite wild that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan has been here just <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> since you left home.&#x2014; And neither time have I seen him!! The first time I was out at the balloon and the second time was yesterday when I was on my back in an agony, and could not have stood up for Jesus Christ</p>
<p>The botheration of hunting on the men of such a careless master and the responsibility of directing them you may partly figure&#x2014;Fanny is the best <pb id="pg-27-273" n="27:273"/>comfort I have had&#x2014;so willing to fly over the moon for me&#x2014;and always making light of her discomforts&#x2014;and now I must write a word of congratulation to John</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>Tho&#x2019; my hand is, as you see, in a very straggling condition, my table ricketty, and my eyes biliously uncertain, I will again write you a word,&#x2014;especially as we are just about to move, and tomorrow evening my date must be a good way up the river from this. I wrote on Sunday last; which letter, together with a Newspaper sent before, I hope you have received. No letter from you, except the first, has arrived here, nor indeed has yet well time; but if anything do come, it will be duly forwarded by &#x201C;Rosa&#x2019;s,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rosetta Neuberg&#x2019;s.</note> assiduous hand. Your Rotterdam letter, tho&#x2019; written for as I announced, has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come; nor will it now, I suppose: so we must just let them keep it, and do ourselves <hi rend="italic">without</hi> that complaisance of theirs,&#x2014;sorrow on them!&#x2014; If at the date of reading this, you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> sent anything forward to Bonn, I say (as above) it will be forwarded; but if you have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> written anything, then at once pray address me, &#x201C;Poste Restante, Frankfurt a. Mayn&#x201C;: if you write <hi rend="italic">at once</hi> on getting this, I shall still be there to get it (till this day week or so), and a letter from my Jeannie will surely be one of the joyfullest occurrences that can befal me in these strange sleepless nervous and otherwise indescribable foreign parts! Oh my own dear little soul, would to God I were in our own little cabin again; even in sooty London, since not under the free sky anywhere, that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be such a blessing;&#x2014;and it seems to me I shall be rather unwilling to get upon the road <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, were I once fairly home!&#x2014; If you have written to Bonn, and are not quite ready to write to Frankfurt at once, then &#x201C;Poste Restante, Dresden&#x201C; will be the next safe address,&#x2014;for perhaps a week longer. Do let me hear from thee; do, do! And that will suffice in regard to Post-Office matters at present.</p>
<p>Last Sunday when I ended we were just going to Rolandseck; a terrestrial paradise, and water-cure, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Neuberg and the world recommended as every way eligible. Well, the little journey took effect (tho&#x2019; under difficulties and mismanagements); but the &#x201C;place&#x201C;&#x2014;it was beautiful exceedingly, but it was as little like sleeping in as Cremorne Gardens<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Popular entertainment grounds in Chelsea.</note> might be; and I turned back from it with horror. Home again therefore in the cool dusk; and next day, <pb id="pg-27-274" n="27:274"/>trial of a small sequestered village called &#x201C;Honef&#x201C; (I believe, <hi rend="italic">Hundhof</hi> or the Hall of <hi rend="italic">Hounds</hi>) at the foot of the Siebengebirge, on the other side of the River. Geo: Dawson (hastily sent home by the Dresden police) had in the meanwhile turned up here, and was a great accession to our liveliness at Honef,&#x2014;where the good Neuberg left us smoking in the inn, and went to seek a lodging for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>,&#x2014;lodging in which human sleep might be possible; and, for a week, a man might have liberty to read a few simple books with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> disturbance that were insupportable. Not entirely to distress the good N., I consented, tho&#x2019; with shuddering reluctance, to try one of his eligiblest plans; and accordingly I packed on the morrow, Dawson and he still with me, and proceeded thither to take possession. What a nice long letter I purposed to write my poor Goody out of that strange place, the heart of a real German <foreign><hi rend="italic">D&#xF6;rflein</hi></foreign> [hamlet] in the lap of the Hills,&#x2014;when once I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have had a night&#x2019;s sleep!&#x2014; Dawson returned to Bonn by the steamer of the Ev<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> Neuberg waited in the inn till next morning to see how I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott</hi></foreign>, of all the places ever discovered even in Germany that Hound-hof surely was the intolerablest for noise! A bed, as everywhere, in Germany, more like a butcher&#x2019;s-tray or a big washing-tub than a bed; with pillows shaped like a <hi rend="italic">wedge</hi> 3 feet broad, and a deep <hi rend="italic">pit</hi> for the middle of the body; with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> vestige of curtains; the very windows curtainless, and needing to be kept wide open (for there is no fireplace or other hole at all) if you will have any air: there you have to sleep or die, go where you will in this country. Then for noises, loud gossip on the street, till towards midnight; tremendous peals of bells from the village Church (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seems once to have been some Cathedral, such force of bells is in it) close by one&#x2019;s head; watchman&#x2019;s horn, of the loudness and tone of a jackass; and a general sanhedrim (apparently) of all the cats and dogs of nature. That was my <foreign><hi rend="italic">nachtlager</hi></foreign> [night&#x2019;s resting place] on the night of tuesday,&#x2014;where nevertheless I did get ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 3 hours sleep; did greatly admire and esteem the goodnatured faithful ways of the poor villagers; smoked 2 or 3 times out of my windows; and on the whole was not so unhappy at all,&#x2014;and had tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> of my loved ones far away, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> were pious rather than otherwise. Neuberg at meeting on the morrow agreed that we must instantly get off towards <hi rend="italic">Homburg</hi> (which is near Frankfurt), perhaps towards Nassau, Ems &#x26;c but always <hi rend="italic">ultimately</hi> thro&#x2019; Frankfurt: at Homburg, if at no other of these places, a week&#x2019;s quiet reading m<hi rend="italic">t</hi> be possible, and he c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> send the Books back to Bonn. Accordingly we set out for home again,&#x2014;over the crown of the Drachenfels, concerning which you shall hear enough one day;&#x2014;and this day we were to have gone, up the River by the Steamer I left a week ago; only N<hi rend="italic">g.</hi> requests today at breakfast it may be put off till tomorrow; and I who have <foreign><hi rend="italic">w&#xE4;sche</hi></foreign> (linens at the wash) not yet come in, and wish to write letters withal, willingly consent. So stands it, then: tomorrow morning at 8 we sail; pass Coblenz, towards Frankfurt; one can get out and stay where one likes, and <pb id="pg-27-275" n="27:275"/>take <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of the following boats till one&#x2019;s ticket is exhausted. In motion I shall be a little better than here in so-called rest. God grant we had done with it all, and were home at Cheyne Row to rest again!&#x2014; But it will be got done; all is; and that is one&#x2019;s comfort here.</p>
<p>Dawson is off homeward like an arrow this morn<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> at wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am not sorry tho&#x2019; the man is a hearty kind of creature, and really worth something. Some &#x201C;Professors&#x201C; here come athwart me, more than I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> avoid,&#x2014;&#x201C;miserable creatures, lost in statistics&#x201C;;&#x2014;old Arndt, a sturdy old fellow of 83, with open face, loud voice, and the liveliest hazel eyes, is the only one I get even a momentary good of: &#x201C;<foreign>io non cerco nessuno</foreign> [I am not looking for anyone]&#x201C;; and find <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gelehrten</hi></foreign> [the scholarly world] in particular less and less charming to me. The River is grand and broad; the country <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> picturesque, and very fertile and pleasant, tho&#x2019; the worst cultivated in creation (a Lothian farmer w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say); the people <hi rend="italic">sonsy</hi>, industrious (in their stupid way), and agreeable to look on, tho&#x2019; tending towards ugliness. Tobacco perpetually burning everywhere. Many Jews abroad; Travellers, if not English, are aptish to be rich Jews with their Jewesses, I think.&#x2014; Neuberg is sensible, not bright; but full of kindness and solid sense. Let not my poor Goody fret herself about me: I am really wonderfully well, in spite of all these outer tribulations and dog-concerts; and doubtless I shall do my journey with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> damage if I take care.&#x2014; &#x2014; Today I ought to write to Varnhagen, to Marshall (of Weimar), to&#x2014;especially to John at Scotsbrig, who had nothing but a word, of the hastiest, from Rotterdam hitherto from me. Pity my eyes were so biliously given, my table so ricketty; I have <hi rend="italic">time</hi> enough and might write at discretion.&#x2014;</p>
<p>By all means <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> that wretched shoemaker Grundy his 4/6 (which is fundamentally an extortion too), and have done with him forevermore!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This is all the paper I dare take for being over-weight (half an English ounce is the weight for you too: mind that). Oh how I long to hear that all is right still; that Goody is well, and has a bed in her own house again. Spur that unhappy Morgan; spur him, spur him! The one good I can expect here is to get my journey <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, and get rapidly home again. <closer><salute>Regards to Nero, the wretch, and a bit of sugar.&#x2014; God bless my dear Jeannie ever.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am surely bound to try if I can write you an intelligible word before quitting Bonn; you have yet got nothing from me but a symbolical Newspaper <pb id="pg-27-276" n="27:276"/>from this place, and from Rotterdam, the miserablest dud of a letter ever written,&#x2014;for which <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had to pay too, my own resources at the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Postkantoor</hi></foreign> (Post-office there) proving insufficient for any but Neuberg&#x2019;s frankage. I hope the Newspaper and it, such as it was, satisfied my poor Mother&#x2019;s anxieties nevertheless. Your letter to Neuberg had arrived before me, and was welcome when I came ashore. I have since had a letter there from Jane: no other news; a letter she had sent to Rotterdam proved too late; and they do not now send it me when written to me. <foreign><hi rend="italic">N&#x2019;importe</hi></foreign> [No matter] since I have heard by a later date.</p>
<p>My night at Rotterdam, owing to <hi rend="italic">cocks</hi>, snoring neighbours, and my own sad agitation, proved altogether sleepless, and I got on board the Dusseldorf steamer in no jocund humour: but there it was far stiller living and really pleasant accommodation; nothing but Dutch and Germans on board: I spoke all the languages I had (to a very <hi rend="italic">small</hi> extent, however; preferring silence, tobacco, and the sight of the Dutch victory over the swamps); I had <hi rend="italic">eight hours</hi> (twice 4 with an interval) of real sleep upon the benches of the vessel); walked 2 hours before and after sunrise ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> D&#xfc;sseldorf, a pleasant interesting town and scene; resumed my boat, and landed here safe, the good Neuberg waiting for me on the shore, about 4 p.m. Since which I have, as it were &#x201C;dee&#x2019;d and done nocht ava&#x2019;.&#x201C; There has indeed been climbing of the Drachenfels, looking over the Bonn Library (for things on Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi>); and much contention with the genius of <hi rend="italic">insomnium</hi> &#x26; <hi rend="italic">Dyspepsia</hi>, of which you shall hear in season: but in fine it is decided we go off up the river again tomorrow morning at 8,&#x2014;towards Frankfurt, perhaps with some lingering ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Nassau,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A region of Prussia, its chief city Wiesbaden.</note> or failing that with a week at Homburg; but thro&#x2019; Frankf<hi rend="italic">t at last:</hi> so that, &#x201C;Poste Restante, Frankf<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a. M.&#x201C; is the address, if you write at once, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> pray do. After Frankfurt I can only give <hi rend="italic">Dresden</hi>, P<hi rend="italic">te</hi> rest<hi rend="italic">te;</hi> and I must recommend you to see how long <hi rend="italic">this</hi> takes to reach you; and to calculate for me accordingly; of course I am very anxious to hear! It is uncertain how long <hi rend="italic">Dresden</hi> will last; N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> talks of getting <hi rend="italic">to Prag</hi> out by W&#xfc;rzburg, Baireuth, Eger &#x26;c on Diligences, as a recommendable thing,&#x2014;about a week&#x2019;s journey from Frankf<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and round to Dresden by Schandau and the S&#xE4;chsische Schweitz;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Saxon Switzerland, mountainous region SE of Dresden.</note>&#x2014;but failing that, there is a railway thro&#x2019; Weimar &#x26;c direct to Dresden; and at Weimar one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> stay a day for auld lang syne. Dresden one or two; after which Leipzig, Torgau &#x26;c, and Berlin (Poste Restante, <hi rend="italic">there</hi> too!) after which we decidedly turn home again, and with <hi rend="italic">wings</hi> if we had them!</p>
<p>This country is really beautiful of its kind, tho&#x2019; not worth <hi rend="italic">going</hi> to see: the Siebengebirge reminds me of Cumberland, and surely is not prettier to the <pb id="pg-27-277" n="27:277"/>&#x201C;eye of taste&#x201C; so-called. I was there yesterday; and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not give 3 groats for any &#x201C;pleasure&#x201C; I had. The people too seem good, <foreign><hi rend="italic">snod, sonsy</hi></foreign> people, tho&#x2019; very poor and seemingly very ignorant. Their ground is all cut into little <hi rend="italic">bedquilts</hi> of gardens; and several hundreds of women (500 or more) come trotting every morning into Bonn to sell their poor twopence worths of potherbs, straw, potatoes fire-wood; such a <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> of human labour, and such wretched scratching under the name of cultivation I have never anywhere seen before. The potatoes are very small; <hi rend="italic">affected</hi> too, but otherwise not much hurt by the disease; a fortunate fact for these poor people, whose resources are otherwise of extreme tenuity. Happily their <hi rend="italic">Garden quilts</hi> are their own, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> rent; &#x26; their thrift is great. Three lads were wheeling dressed paving-stones yesterday down the Drachenfels as N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> and I ascended: a steep height, not so high as Criffel; they c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do 7 journeys in a day, and got a groschen each per journey: 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi> a day; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was by no means equal to coining in the way of wages! They had heard of England; and longed much to be there; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I earnestly dissuaded; recommending America instead, of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the poor souls had also heard with hope. They looked healthy, but leanish, hungryish; had fustain<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> clothes, rather ragged and coarse shirt&#x2014;&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">diese spinnt die mutter</hi></foreign> [spun by the mother].&#x201C; N.b. I talk bad German quite freely from time to time, when absolute need is; but shall never, or not at this time, get to be even modestly correct in it.</p>
<p>Bonn, beyond some Books ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> F<hi rend="italic">k</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am to take with me to Homburg or Nassau and there examine, has little or nothing to interest the human soul: I have seen some Professor people: old Arndt is alone <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> seeing, 83 years old, and fresh as ever yet, a brave, loud-talking, hoping cheery-hearted old man;&#x2014;of the others <foreign>ach Gott,&#x2014;lehrt immer in G&#xF6;ttingen</foreign> [oh God,&#x2014;still teaching in G&#xF6;ttingen]!</p>
<p>Brumagen Dawson has been here these 3 days; only went this morning: the police had sent him off <hi rend="italic">in a hurry</hi> from Dresden (owing to Baroness Beck, as we conjecture, and Austrian influence there): he is a free-flowing, ingenious creature, going all to wind (by stump-oratory) as himself seems to be painfully aware. I found him amusing while he lasted here; amid the deep dulness of the place.&#x2014; In tobacco I have only been moderately successful; item in pills; item in sleep&#x2014; Did <hi rend="italic">Bed</hi>lam ever contrive such &#x201C;beds&#x201C; as these German one&#x2019;s are? As if you tried to sleep in a big potatoe-basket; in a corn-chest half a foot too short for you! However, I try to get used to it, and have made some improvements.</p>
<p>Oh Mother, oh my good old Mother, how are you, or what are you doing? Many times my tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> go after you!&#x2014; And Jamie and the busy harvest (now all <pb id="pg-27-278" n="27:278"/>getting <hi rend="italic">carried</hi>): many a glance of that has come flashing on me thro&#x2019; the strange scenes here present to me! I can only apply to you for news, and send my affection to all.</p>
<p>Again thank Dr Hunter very much if you write to him; and say I have discovered that I owe him still 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi> (of money he laid out for me), and will clear that account by stamps, were I once home.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother,&#x2014;blessings on you dear Mother and the rest;&#x2014;may I hear soon and you all be well! Ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Goodness gracious!</salute> I wonder what &#x201C;England expects&#x201C; of me at the present crisis? Ought I to cry, or laugh, or <hi rend="italic">scream</hi>, or what on earth&#x2014;? screaming comes always readiest to me; with the contingent peculiarity, as Lord Ashburton once remarked, that I always &#x201C;run <hi rend="italic">towards</hi> what I scream at, and never <hi rend="italic">away from</hi> it&#x201C;! So let it be understood then; that I <hi rend="italic">scream</hi> at your constancy, as in presence of the <hi rend="italic">supernatural!</hi> and at the same time feel myself as much attracted as <hi rend="italic">scared</hi> by the supernaturalness&#x2014; In fact your letter, so full of old affection and trust, dropt to me as it were out of the skies, and what M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle would call &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Eternities</hi>,&#x201C; has produced considerable bewilderment of my matronly wits&#x2014;so that I could almost fall to doubting for the moment, Whether I be the present flesh-and-blood M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle or the Ghost of little Miss Welsh! a perpetually recurring form of doubt with me, to say the truth, independently of wakings up of old Lovers. When I went to Haddington, <hi rend="italic">incognito</hi>, three years ago,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1849-08-00">Aug. 1849</date>, see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490802-JWC-MAAN-01"><sic>24:159&#x2013;71</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s MAAN, <date when="1849-08-02">2 Aug. 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note> I bought some little <foreign><hi rend="italic">quaighs</hi></foreign> in a Coopers shop I used to have <hi rend="italic">the run of</hi>, and in my character of travelling Englishwoman, seized with a sudden passion for wooden dishes, I got the Cooper into talk about his townsfolk present and past&#x2014;and he told me <hi rend="italic">this</hi> amongst other interesting things, that &#x201C;D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Welsh&#x2019;s death was the sorest loss ever came to the place, that he left a Daughter, a very <hi rend="italic">tasty</hi> young Leddy in his (the cooper&#x2019;s) opinion; but she went away into England poor thing and <hi rend="italic">died there!!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;Perhaps that old Cooper had better information on my subject than the rest of the world had. I certainly left his shop that summers evening with a horrible apprehension of being &#x201C;thin air&#x201C;&#x2014;the &#x201C;pretty white heels&#x201C; and all!&#x2014; <pb id="pg-27-279" n="27:279"/>Well! if one went largely into the question who among us is <hi rend="italic">really alive</hi>, and who only <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> the upper earth by sufferance, there would be no continuing in such a spectral world as one would find this to be&#x2014; So leaving all that, let me assure you that your loving remembrance is very precious to me&#x2014;not that people dont love me any longer, in a general way&#x2014;quite the contrary&#x2014;from my dog upwards, creatures still attach themselves to me with <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> enthusiasm&#x2014;but Oh dear! a little old love, bringing with it airs from <hi rend="italic">long ago</hi> (God bless it!) is worth a vast deal of new love&#x2014;at least to my retrospective turn of thought</p>
<p>I suppose it is in the highest degree unconventional to tell another man than one&#x2019;s lawful husband, that one cares about his love and is grateful to him for it&#x2014; But what matter?

I have altered all the others, and cut them very much shorter, which I hope will be an improvement. You sent me three leaves of the third chapter, and as I suppose you sent them to be mended I tried to do so, and have compressed them considerably. So I hope you will be better satisfied with them on the whole. As I am somewhat after time, will you forward them as soon as you can, and put the three leaves in the right place? In the condition of your household I had some qualms of bothering you with this batch of MS., but as you have the other portion, it will be as little trouble to send all as half, and very much more satisfactory to me if you have time to look them over and say how you find them. But don&#x2019;t feel obliged to read them unless &#x2018;time and the hour&#x2019; are propitious, and in conjunction with your own inclination. I feel very much obliged to you for making me re-write those chapters&#x201C; (Ireland 440&#x2013;41).</note>&#x2014;not my own&#x2014;if it were I would give more for its chances of getting published&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>As there was already a letter gone to you, Dear, and as next day was Sunday, when there would be some human quiet, I did not answer yesterday by return of post, but went instead to the City where I had business.</salute> Indeed it was well to get out into Space yesterday, for the Plasterers were rushing about like demons finishing off, and clearing away their scaffoldings &#x26;c; and the Plumbers were once more boiling lead in the kitchen to repair some spout on the roof, and a note I had written to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan, that your Brother Alick &#x201C;never did the like o&#x2019;,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;John Clerk (Lord Eldin ultimately) [<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5619"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>], of the Scotch &#x2018;Court of Session,&#x2019; a man of great faculty and singular, rather cynical, ways, and much famed in Edinburgh, was a <hi rend="italic">dilettante</hi> in art withal, and an expensive collector of pictures.

<salute>My dear Lady Stanley</salute>
<p>In my Husbands last letter from Bonn there is a <hi rend="italic">touching</hi> notice of your little boy which ought I think to be sent you bodily&#x2014; I hope the little boy was equally &#x201C;affected&#x201C; at sight of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C. Did they fall on each others necks, do you suppose, and weep? I am delighted that this german tour seems to be exercising such softening influences on M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, and shouldnt wonder now if on his return he were &#x201C;affected&#x201C; at the sight of <hi rend="italic">me!</hi></p>
<p>Nothing can exceed the destestability<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> of my present life&#x2014;superintending workmen of every denomination who wont <hi rend="italic">get on</hi>, for weeks I havnt even had a christian bed to sleep in; but sleep &#x201C;all about&#x201C; sometimes on sofas in my own house sometimes, in hired beds abroad&#x2014;when I am invariably bitten by what Mazzini calls &#x201C;small beings&#x201C; (in plain English) <hi rend="italic">bugs!</hi> &#x201C;My Heavens&#x201C; (as Lord Ashburton says) wont I know all my life long what &#x201C;a thorough repair&#x201C; means! I was at Addiscombe with Lady A three days last week. She is now at the Grange and Lord A returned from Scotland. I thought her much thinner but she was well she said.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-284" n="27:284"/>Have you heard of the eldest Miss Farrer&#x2019;s schoking accident! her nose broken in two places by a fall! Poor girl! she has to wear a black mask. The D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> say she &#x201C;will not ultimately be disfigured,&#x201C; but that must be merely to keep up her spirits.</p>

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest, for your long and kind Bonn Letter,</salute> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> reached me safely yesterday morning at Frankfurt (10 miles from this): the assiduous Rosa had inclosed it to Neuberg; and how welcome it was to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at the &#x201C;Braunfels&#x201C; (Jew Bankinghouse) where N. had gone to get money,&#x2014;all right now! Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Rotterdam letter, it seems, is safe; <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> another shilling too to have it safe: a second letter, which I hope you have under way, to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Frankfurt</hi>, poste restante,&#x201C; has not yet time, for a day or two; but proper instructions can be left, it seems, and shall, with the Post-officials at Frankf<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, and if not <hi rend="italic">there</hi> before we go, then at Weimar (where a day&#x2019;s rest is to be), I shall get that too, and rejoice in my little kind despatching Goody and the news she sends. Thank God, no bad news; not fundamentally bad, tho&#x2019; so supremely bothersome on the surface. What a day was that on the sofa after a night of foul paint-smells and misery! Oh if we had but these wretched mortals once fairly <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of our poor little habitation, shouldn&#x2019;t we be shy to let them in again: don&#x2019;t they wish they may get in again! Patience, patience, my little Dame; I see you are getting them <hi rend="italic">cast out</hi>, these devils, worse than Mary Magdalen&#x2019;s;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Mark 16:9.</note> daylight begins to shine thro&#x2019; that sad adventure, and we will laugh at it, from the safe <hi rend="italic">other</hi> side, some day.

<p>We did get out of Bonn fairly on Friday morning; a &#x201C;washerwoman&#x201C; of mine (dreadfully <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> and damp she proves) and various little interests of N.&#x2019;s rendered Thursday unadvisable; but Friday, at 8 a.m., then we did start, up the lordly Rhine again, under auspices at first wettish, but wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> dried and <pb id="pg-27-285" n="27:285"/>brightened by degrees. The ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> before, I had found out C. Barton&#x2019;s return, and made N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> lead me to his house: A considerably altered man, and all for the worse: puffy face, much crowfooted, scratch-wig <hi rend="italic">discoverable</hi> with some difficulty; manners as of some empty fop in a play; a &#x201C;Ha! ha!&#x201C; as destitute of joy as ever sounded from the <foreign>soi-disant</foreign> human throat: in fact, a <foreign><hi rend="italic">verfehltes Leben</hi></foreign> [failed life], poor devil, and a wretched egoist <foreign><hi rend="italic">Hofnarr</hi></foreign> [court jester] from whom I was willing to escape after some minutes. Anthony S.&#x2019;s adventure at Dessau, it appears, was <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than we heard: the police took him not for a &#x201C;political exile&#x201C; at all, but for a fugitive Jew Banker&#x2019;s Clerk (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Jude ist Jude</hi></foreign> [A Jew is a Jew]), which Jew B<hi rend="italic">r</hi> had run off with immense monies not long before!&#x2014; Don&#x2019;t speak of that,&#x2014;not till my return.</p>
<p>Of the Rhine you shall hear enough by and by: it is verily a &#x201C;noble river&#x201C;; much broader than the Thames at full tide, and rolling along many feet in depth, with banks quite trim, at a rate of 4 or 5 miles on hour, <hi rend="italic">with</hi>t voice, but full of boiling eddies; the most magnificent image of silent power I have ever seen; and in fact one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">first</hi> idea of a World-<hi rend="italic">river.</hi> This broad swift sheet, rolling strong and calm (in <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> rage) for 3 or 4 hundred miles is itself far the grandest thing I have seen here, or shall likely see.&#x2014;But enough of it, N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> and I got out at Coblenz that Friday ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 2 p.m. and by N.&#x2019;s suggestion put ourselves into the <foreign>coup&#xE9;</foreign> of an Ems Omnibus,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Bad</hi> Ems, 10 miles off, up a <hi rend="italic">side</hi> valley (<hi rend="italic">east</hi> side) there to try for a quiet sleeping-place, and day for excerpting German Books. Which really answered well. Ems is the strangest place you ever saw: Matlock, but a far steeper set of rocks close to rear, in front a river equal to Nith; and half a mile of the brightest part of Rue de Rivoli (say, Regent&#x2019;s Quadrant) set into it:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rue de Rivoli is a street of smart shops in Paris running alongside the Louvre and Tuileries gardens. The Regent&#x2019;s Quadrant, nr. Regent St. in London, had expensive shops. The Carlyles had visited Matlock, in the Peak District of Derbyshire, in <date when="1847-08-00">Aug. 1847</date>. The river Nith rises in Ayrshire and flows SE into the Solway Firth 10 mi. S of Dumfries.</note> a place as from the Opera direct, and inhabited by Devil&#x2019;s servants chiefly. Of it enough in winter evenings that are coming! We got the quietest lodging perhaps in Germany (not very quiet either) at the further end of the place, <hi rend="italic">last</hi> house and abutting on fields: there in spite of cocks I got one night&#x2019;s sleep and 2 half ones, and did all my bits of Books (except 2 wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have now finished here); and shall not undertake any similar job while here. Better <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> the Books in gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and bring them home to read. At Ems we inquired diligently for Miss Wynne (as here also), to no effect. We saw Russians gambling every evening, heard music by the river side, among fantastic promenades and Regents-Quadrant edifices, and Devil&#x2019;s-servant people every evening every morning; saw a dance too, unforgetable by man;&#x2014;in fine drove, in cheap <foreign><hi rend="italic">cuddy</hi></foreign>-vehicle, very respec<supplied>[t]</supplied>able, on Sunday ev<supplied>[en]</supplied>ing,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted here and letter omitted previously.</note> up to Nassau (Burg Nassau, the birthplace of &#x201C;W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> the Silent&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William I, known as William the Silent (<date when="1533-00-00">1533</date>&#x2013;<date when="1584-00-00">84</date>), count of Nassau and duke of Orange, Protestant leader and founder of the Dutch republic.</note> <pb id="pg-27-286" n="27:286"/>and other heroes); a kind of pious pilgrimage, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am glad to have done. At the top of the high tower, on a high woody hill, one has of course a &#x201C;view&#x201C;&#x2014;not worth much to me. But I entered my name in their Album; and plucked that one particle of flower, on the tip top of all, which I now send to thee,&#x2014;keep it carefully, &#x26; mark on it &#x201C;Burg Nassau, <date when="1852-09-12">12 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1852</date>&#x201C;: do, and be a good Lassie! Next morning we left Ems; joined our steamboat at Coblenz, and away again to the <hi rend="italic">sublime</hi> portions of the Rhine country: very sublime indeed,&#x2014;really worth a sight; say 100 miles of a Lochlomond (or <hi rend="italic">half</hi> Loch Lomond) all rushing on at 5 miles an hour, and with queer old towns and ruined castles on the banks: a grand silence too; and <hi rend="italic">gray</hi> day, adding to one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">sadness</hi> of mood; for a &#x201C;fine sorrow&#x201C; (not coarse) is the utmost I can bring it too in this world usually! Beyond Coblentz our boat was too crowded; nasty people, several of them, French mainly; stupid, and polite, English mainly,&#x2014;there was a sprinkling of Irish too, &#x201C;looking at the vine-clad hills&#x201C; (as I heard them <foreign><hi rend="italic">lilting</hi></foreign> and saying). Neuberg guided and guides, &#x26; does for me, as only a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> power of <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, reinforced by loyalty and friendship, could,&#x2014;bless him, the good and sensible, but wearisome &#x26; rather heavy man! At Mainz, at dusk, it was decidedly pleasant to get out, and have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with the Rhine (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had now grown quite flat on each side, and full of islands with willows, not to speak of <hi rend="italic">chained</hi> (anchored) corn-mills &#x26;c &#x26;c: Maintz and Faust of Maintz we had to survey by <hi rend="italic">cat&#x2019;s</hi> light,&#x2014;good enough for us and it, I fancy;&#x2014;in fine ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 10 at night the railway (20 miles or so) brought us to Frankfurt; and the wearied human tabernacle, in well-<hi rend="italic">waxed</hi> wainscotted upper apart<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>, in the &#x201C;Dutch <hi rend="italic">Hof</hi>,&#x201C; prepared itself to court repose,&#x2014;not with the best prospects, for the street or Square (Rossmarkt, joining with Theater Platz) was still rattling with vehicles, and indeed continued to do so, and we left it rattling. Of the night&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> we had as well say nothing: I remembered Goody over the Malvern Inn-Gate, and endeavoured to possess my soul in patience.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luke 21:19.</note>&#x2014; In shaving next morning, with my face to the Square, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was very lively and had trees in the middle, I caught with the corner of my eye sight of a <hi rend="italic">face</hi> which was evidently Goethe&#x2019;s: <foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott</hi></foreign>, merely in <hi rend="italic">stone</hi>, in the middle of the Platz amid the trees;&#x2014;I had so longed to see that face alive, and here it was given to me at last, as if with huge world-irony, in stone! An emblem of so much that happens: this also gave me a moment&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">genial</hi> sorrow, or something of the sort.</p>
<p>From Bonn I had written to Mephisto Marshall at Weimar: behold, one of the first faces the morning offered me at Frankfurt was that of Marshall himself, who had come in person to meet us the night before, and had been at <pb id="pg-27-287" n="27:287"/>the Post-Office and at all inns,&#x2014;the friendly, ugly little man. He expressed great regret that you were not there, as he had rashly fancied from the &#x201C;we&#x201C; of my Note; was quite desolate to hear I could not stop at Weimar, or any place, beyond one day, for want of sleep: he went about with us everywhere, and at first threatened to be rather a burden, but by degrees grew manageable and rather useful, till we dined together and parted on our several routes.

At 5 p.m. N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> put me into an Omnibus (vile crowded airless place), and in 2 hours bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me here, in quest of an old lodging he had had, &#x201C;the quietest in the world,&#x201C; where we <hi rend="italic">were</hi> lucky enough to find a floor unoccupied, and still are for at least one other day. As I said, my Book-excerpting (<foreign><hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi></foreign> [for what it&#x2019;s worth]) is as good as done; and the place is really quite rustic; out at the very end of Homburg, and that by narrow lanes; I see nothing but <hi rend="italic">fields</hi> and hear nothing but our own internal noises: last night accordingly I expected <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>,&#x2014;alas, our upper-floor lodgers took <hi rend="italic">gripes</hi>, took ill,&#x2014;Devil mend them,&#x2014;and my <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> was nothing to <foreign>crack</foreign> of.

Of Homburg proper (which is quite out of sight and hearing, yet within 5 minutes walk) N. and I took survey last night: a Public set of Rooms (<hi rend="italic">Kur-saal</hi> they call such things) finer than some palaces (all supported by gambling, all built by one big French gambling <hi rend="italic">entrepreneur</hi>); and such a set of damnable faces (French, Italian and Russian, with <hi rend="italic">dull</hi> English in quantities) as were never seen out of Hell before!

<salute>My dear John</salute>
<p>I always think the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> days the busiest that have yet been or ever <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be! No maid of all-work in a lodging house was ever put to more base uses than my elegant self at this time! To write during the day is almost impossible, and at night I am so wearied that I have no heart to do anything but sit on a chair, &#x201C;looking from me,&#x201C; and scheming what I shall do on the morrow. As the place gets cleared, I have to move those awful piles of goods and chattels and distribute them over the house, and every thing is got so dirty and spoiled that <pb id="pg-27-289" n="27:289"/>I am &#x201C;entangled in the details and make no way.&#x201C; Thank<hi rend="small-caps">s</hi> God, however, the workmen are gradually &#x201C;returning from the thirty years war.&#x201C; My Plasterers and Plumbers are gone, and my Bricklayers and Carpenters going, and I have now only painting and paperhanging to endure for a week or two longer. The worst is that the whole thing cant be finished at this earthquake. The drawing room and front bedroom cant be papered till next spring on account of the new plaster. And the parlours I dare not begin painting, in case of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C coming home in the midst. Oh Heaven defend me from ever having to make another house &#x201C;habitable&#x201C;! the discomfort is nothing to the <hi rend="italic">fret.</hi></p>
<p>Meanwhile the Duke of Wellington is dead.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexpectedly on <date when="1852-09-14">14 Sept.</date></note> I shall not meet him at Balls any more nor <hi rend="italic">kiss his shoulder</hi> poor old man. All the news I have had from the outer world this week is sad. You remember Miss Farrer, the prettiest of the two. She was on a visit at Sir W Clayton&#x2019;s,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Sir William Robert Clayton (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), 5th bart., of Marden Park, Surrey.</note> and they took her to church in their carriage with her back to the horses, which always makes her sick. Not liking to confess this <hi rend="italic">weakness</hi>, she insisted on returning from church in the rumble, and one of the party said &#x201C;Oh, Miss Farrer prefers getting up into the rumble to show her handsome ancles.&#x201C; So <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to show her ancles in getting down; she <hi rend="italic">leapt</hi>, and her dress hindering, fell smash with her face on the pavement a small vessel was ruptured in her head and the blood gushed from her mouth and nose, and when the surgeon came and was plugging her nose to stop the blood he found it was <hi rend="italic">broken</hi> in two places! The poor girl is returned home with a black mask, and her nose continues dreadfully swelled, and tho&#x2019; the London surgeon <hi rend="italic">says</hi> it will not disfigure her, I dont believe but she is a fright for life! She bears it beautifully as yet.</p>
<p>Do you know anything of Herzen? a Russian who sent M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C a book&#x2014;Saffi brought him to me the other night. And Count &#x26; Countess Reichenbach were here&#x2014;there were <hi rend="italic">five</hi> of us and we spoke <hi rend="italic">four</hi> languages&#x2014;and all four in the same sentence sometimes. It was like talking in a Madhouse! He is a brave energetic looking man Herzen but with a basis of <hi rend="italic">barbarian</hi> His tawny eyes have a hungry animal look that made me feel as if he might easily spring at me and eat me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Herzen wrote to friends that TC had read his booklet, <hi rend="italic">Von anderen Ufer</hi> (Hamburg, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), and that he had been invited to Cheyne Row. He had already communicated with and heard from TC, and they met in <date when="1852-12-00">Dec.</date> Herzen was to stay a few years in England and then settle chiefly in France. In spite of still noting his dissent from TC, he continued to admire him as one of the few serious spirits in Europe who were gravely reconsidering public affairs.</note> Little Oscar is getting better, which is a great mercy, very little would drive the little Countess as mad as her brother.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Plattnauer. Little Oskar was her son.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-290" n="27:290"/>&#x201C;Like M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newton&#x201C;&#x2014;that is charming!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently in response to a remark of John&#x2019;s. John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1852-09-12">12 Sept.</date> to TC, that he had been to Moffat and &#x201C;succeeded with the <hi rend="italic">Banning</hi> there. We are now seriously &#x26; solemnly engaged to each other. I have not spoken of this to any one here except my mother, &#x26; only to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Hunter, John Gordon &#x26; Jane elsewhere; for there seems little use in talking. You can tell Neuberg too if you choose. Our mother was resigned &#x26; rather sad at first, but now she is really gratified in her own sober way at the turn things have taken.&#x201C;</note> When shall I see her? it is really very pleasant to me the idea of a new sister in law! What on earth puts it in peoples heads to call <hi rend="italic">me</hi> formidable? There is not a creature alive that is more unwilling to hurt the feelings of others, and I grow more <hi rend="italic">compatible</hi> every year that I live. I cant count the people who have said to me first and last, &#x201C;I was <hi rend="italic">so</hi> afraid of you! I had been told you were so sarcastic&#x201C;! And really I am perfectly unconscious of dealing in that sort of thing at all&#x2014; I think one sarcastic person in a family quite enough. and limit my own ambition to being <hi rend="italic">liked</hi> not <hi rend="italic">feared.</hi> So depend on it <hi rend="italic">the Baiying</hi> will be agreeably disappointed when we meet&#x2014;</p>
<p>But now I should be in bed&#x2014;Nero is already loudly snoring on a chair.</p>

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>Will you again accept a hurried word from me, such as the whirl of railways and noisy inns permits to the unfortunate: we have just arrived here an hour ago, and, after tea, and wandering over a cigar thro&#x2019; the dim streets, I report progress before going to bed;&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">bed</hi> (if such we are to call it), but as to sleep&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott</hi></foreign>, patience is one&#x2019;s only remedy on that head too for the present!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I got your Letter at Frankfurt on Tuesday morning; there it lay waiting for me, and doubtless the Heavens will reward your punctuality some day. Another Letter, from my Wife, forwarded from Bonn by another channel, reached me in the course of the same morning; and the news from home, if nothing else, were of a consolatory nature.&#x2014; Our journey had begun, as advertised, on this day week; but at Coblentz the same afternoon we turned aside to Bad-Ems; a beautiful drive up the Lahn,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >River flowing S and SW into the Rhine 4 mi. SE of Koblenz.</note> and a strange if not a beautiful place,&#x2014;like a bit of the <hi rend="italic">rue de Rivoli</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Palais Royal</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both in Paris.</note> put into the throat <pb id="pg-27-291" n="27:291"/>of the Trosachs,&#x2014;amusing to look at for three days. I tasted the water,&#x2014;like <hi rend="italic">boiled</hi> Selzer;&#x2014;listened to the music; looked at the Nondescripts of mankind there wrestling ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> <foreign>ennui</foreign>, dancing, gambling in <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kursaals</hi></foreign> [casinos], and feeding sadly at <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tables-d&#x2019;h&#xF4;te:</hi></foreign> I had some Books from Bonn Library to read withal, and finished most of them; on Sunday afternoon we drove to Nassau, and visited, not without interest, the Stammburg [ancestral castle] of the Orange Heroes, the birthplace of William the Silent;&#x2014;Mme. Guizot<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sophie-Elisabeth, F. P. G. Guizot&#x2019;s mother.</note> and Falloux had been there before us, and had severally expressed their reverence; as such man might well do in such a scene? On the whole I was very glad to see it, and the House of Prussian Stein, and even his Daughter, an old black <foreign>Gr&#xE4;fin</foreign> [countess], with a big nose like his.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron Heinrich Friedrich Karl von Stein (<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), Prussian statesman who planned far-reaching reforms in the Prussian administrative system during the Napoleonic occupation. He had three das.</note> But I must hasten. Surveying Maintz by the light of fish-oil (very dim indeed in the few lamps) we got to Frankfurt by rail on Monday Night; summing up the visions of the Lurlei, Bingerloch, and other Rhine miracles,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Lorelei is a rocky promontory and the Bingerloch a whirlpool nr. Bingen.</note> by a prose jumble in the belly of the steam-demon, transacted in total darkness,&#x2014;which at last threw us out near the foot of Goethe&#x2019;s statue, in a City I had often wished to see,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frankfurt.</note> and now did at last see when I could as well have dispensed with it. Alas, looking out next morning, a <hi rend="italic">known</hi> face startled me among the trees of the Square: Goethe&#x2019;s face, I saw well, but it was <hi rend="italic">in stone</hi>,&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">such</hi> manner had my old wishes been fulfilled for me! As is not quite unusual in this world. That same evening, after infinite running about, we got out to Homburg, the noise of Frankf<hi rend="italic">t</hi> (in Fair time too) being utterly unbearable; and at Homburg I did stay 3 nights and 2 days; left it this morning, and surely shall not soon forget it among the places I have seen in the world. Is there the like of it, I wonder, that the Sun now looks upon from the Zodiac anywhere? A similar set of mortals, or of human occupations, I had hardly imagined to myself before. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott in Himmel!</hi></foreign> It was not possible for me even to find out the House, on the &#x201C;Parade,&#x201C; where you had lived; my only real pleasure (tho&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">sight</hi> of the place and its ways surpassed all Foote&#x2019;s Farces)<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Samuel Foote (<date when="1720-00-00">1720</date>&#x2013;<date when="1777-00-00">77</date>), dramatist.</note> was the hour last night with the Augustenburgs, whom I could not catch till then, but who took me then to their House, and were extremely kind and human to me,&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">your</hi> sake again, as I reflected, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> did not make the favour less agreeable to me. With the Duchess, in spite of defect of language, I could do very well; and there were the two young men, fine ingenuous young fellows, and the young women,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luise Sophie (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>), m. <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>. There were two sons&#x2014;Friedrich Christian August (<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80)</date> and Friedrich Christian Karl August (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1917-00-00">1917</date>)&#x2014;and three das.&#x2014;Friederike Marie Luise Auguste Caroline Henriette (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">72</date>), Caroline Amalie (<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1901-00-00">1901</date>), and Caroline Christiane Auguste Emilie Henriette Elisabeth (<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1917-00-00">1917</date>).</note> beautiful <pb id="pg-27-292" n="27:292"/>young creatures, who spoke English with me, and pressed me to tea, while the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Alte Herr</hi></foreign> sat curling his moustachios in a very leonine and genial tho&#x2019; taciturn manner. Many, many friendly questions were asked about you and Lord A., wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I answered as well as might be in the mixed Babylonian dialects we were reduced to. In short I am very glad I went; and in an hour I had done myself a real kindness, I perceived. Poor old Wellington, I had heard that ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> he was dead! Lord Clanrickarde, visible for a moment amid some explosion of music, had hastily imparted the news to me, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> History will not forget for some time. In all the world there is not left now, that we know of, such a man. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu, eheu!</hi></foreign> And yet what c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> one wish but that he sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> die, having <hi rend="italic">done</hi> all his work? Farewell to him, the farewell due to Heroes.&#x2014; In the old Homburg <hi rend="italic">Schloss</hi> (thanks to you for mentioning it) I had found, the day before, a great many things to interest me: excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Portraits, Marlbro&#x2019;, Gustavus, &#x201C;Great Elector&#x201C; (F<hi rend="italic">k</hi>&#x2019;s great grandfather), Queen Christina, Czar Peter &#x26;c. &#x26;c;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Churchill (<date when="1650-00-00">1650</date>&#x2013;<date when="1722-00-00">1722</date>), 1st duke of Marlborough, English military commander in several continental wars.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have got safe here, a few hours ago; and will send a hasty word to you at Scotsbrig before going to bed: I have heard nothing from you yet, except a little word thro&#x2019; Jane at second hand; I can only hope all is going tolerably with you, and trust I may hear expressly so before long. It seems you did not get the newspaper I sent from Bonn; the letter from Rotterdam which you did get was only better than mere nothing: alas, I can very seldom command the smallest convenience for writing;&#x2014;and tonight too all that I can say will be confused enough, and probably the Doctor will even have his own ados with reading.</p>
<p>From want of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> I have suffered fully as much as I expected; such <hi rend="italic">beds</hi>, and such contrivances for the <hi rend="italic">admission</hi> of noise, light and other disturbances into bedrooms I have never seen before! But in all other respects my journey has been fortunate, and I have had nothing but thankfulness to feel on all hands. I am hastening on, too, to get my German travels <hi rend="italic">ended;</hi> and hope, in a couple of weeks hence, or <hi rend="italic">soon</hi> at any rate, to be home again in Chelsea, there to sleep and rest! Neuberg is worth ten <hi rend="italic">couriers</hi> (Jack can explain that to you); and is the kindest of friends over and above. In about 5 days more I expect to be lodged in <hi rend="italic">Berlin</hi>, and that is the ultimatum of my journey, from which point, were my business there once done, I shall hasten home again, and no dirt sticking to my heels! But let me tell you a little about my course since you last heard of me thro&#x2019; Jane; especially about what I saw today and yesterday, which is more particularly my good Mother&#x2019;s property than most other things I have seen or shall see.</p>
<p>After about a week in Bonn, which was not interesting at all, nor capable of yielding any good repose, we set forth up the Rhine, on the morning of Friday gone a week: beautiful sailing up the beautifullest River in the world; at Coblenz we turned aside for 3 days to Bad-Ems (some 10 miles off), and in that strange scene of Bathers, Dancers, Gamblers and other <hi rend="italic">jingly</hi> characters, strangely enough, we were very quiet, and I successfully read out most part of a stock of Books I had got in Bonn Library. On Monday last, we were back to Coblentz again, and from that to Frankfurt (Goethe&#x2019;s Birthplace) the <pb id="pg-27-294" n="27:294"/>same evening. On the morrow, shaving myself at the front side of my noisy room, I noticed by the corner of my eye a known face among the trees of the square down below,&#x2014;Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">face</hi>, and alas it was <hi rend="italic">of stone;</hi> now when I saw it as I had often longed to do, it could not see <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at all, and was not of flesh but of stone!&#x2014; Frankfurt being intolerably noisy (especially as it was fair time) we made off for Bad-Homburg that same afternoon (10 or 12 miles away); staid at Homburg 2 days till I fairly finished off my Bonn Books,&#x2014;one of the strangest scenes the Sons of Adam ever contrived for themselves in this world; the rallying place I do believe of such a set of empty blackguards as are not found elsewhere in the world! Several English and others, however <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of the blackguard species, were there, whom I knew.&#x2014; On the morning of the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> day, we got upon the rail again; came as far as Cassel, having stopped at <hi rend="italic">Marburg</hi> for some hours; a strange, most ancient Town, famed for some of <hi rend="italic">Luther&#x2019;s</hi> operations, and for being the Landgraf <hi rend="italic">Philip of Hesse&#x2019;s</hi> place of residence:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philip (<date when="1504-00-00">1504</date>&#x2013;<date when="1567-00-00">67</date>), landgrave of Hesse, also known as Philip the Magnanimous; a leader of the Reformation; arranged at Marburg, <date when="1529-00-00">1529</date>, the disputation between Martin Luther (<date when="1483-00-00">1483</date>&#x2013;<date when="1546-00-00">1546</date>) and Ulrich Zwingli (<date when="1484-00-00">1484</date>&#x2013;<date when="1531-00-00">1531</date>), Swiss Protestant reformer.</note> his high old Castle, where we loitered a couple of hours, is now a Correction House, filled with criminals and soldiers (which later were all <hi rend="italic">paring potatoes</hi> for themselves when we first arrived); the chamber of conference between Luther, Zwingli &#x26;c is used for keeping hay. The next morning brought us from Cassel to <hi rend="italic">Eisenach</hi> with its <hi rend="italic">Wartburg</hi>, where Luther lay concealed translating the Bible; and then I spent one of the most interesting forenoons I ever got by travelling;&#x2014;of which, if I had any convenience at all, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> so gladly give you some account.</p>
<p>Eisenach is about as big as Dumfries, a very old town but well whitewashed; all built of brick and oak with red-tile roofs of amazing steepness, and several grim old swag-bellied steeples and churches and palatial residences rising conspiculous<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> over them. It stands on a perfect plain by the side of a little river; plain <hi rend="italic">smaller</hi> than Langholm,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >11 mi. ENE of Ecclefechan.</note> and surrounded by hills which are not so high, yet of a somewhat similar character, and are all grassy and many of them thickly wooded. Directly on the south side of it there rises one Hill, somewhat as Lockerby Hill in point of height and position, but clothed with trim rich woods all the way, thro&#x2019; which wind paths with prospect-houses &#x26;c: on the top of this Hill stands the old <hi rend="italic">Wartburg</hi>, which it takes your<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> &#xbe; of an hour to reach by <foreign><hi rend="italic">speeling</hi></foreign> pretty briskly: an old Castle (&#x201C;watch-Castle&#x201C; is the name of it), near 800 years old; where there is still a kind of &#x201C;Garrison&#x201C; kept (perhaps 20 men),&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it does not much look like a <hi rend="italic">Fortress;</hi> what one sees from below being mainly two monstrous old <hi rend="italic">houses</hi> (so to speak) with <pb id="pg-27-295" n="27:295"/>enormous roofs to them,&#x2014;comparable to two gigantic <hi rend="italic">peat-stacks</hi>, set somewhat apart;&#x2014;there are other lower buildings that connect these, when one gets up; there is also of course a wall all round, a donjon tower standing (like <hi rend="italic">Repentance</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Repentance Tower on Hoddam Hill.</note> in size and shape); and the Duke of Weimar, to whom the place belongs, is engaged in restorations &#x26;c and has many masons employed on it just now. I heeded little of all else they had to shew except <hi rend="italic">Junker Georg&#x2019;s</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An alias used by Luther when concealed there. Neuberg wrote to his sister, <date when="1852-09-20">20 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;It was touching to see Carlyle&#x2019;s reverence (<foreign><hi rend="italic">piet&#xE4;t</hi></foreign>) for all the relics of Luther, in whose room he said, &#x2018;There is no more sacred spot in the whole earth for me to stand upon than this.&#x2019; He reverently laid his hand on everything that had come from Luther, and kissed his table. &#x2026; C. had promised his mother to trace out all footsteps of Luther.&#x201C; (Sadler 287).</note> (Martin Luther&#x2019;s) Chamber, which is in the <hi rend="italic">nearest</hi> of the &#x201C;Peat-stacks,&#x201C; the one nearest Eisenach, and close by the Gate where you enter, on your right hand. A short stair of old-worn stone conducts you up; they open the door; you enter a little apartment, <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than your best room at Scotsbrig, I almost think less than your smallest; a very poor low room, with one old <hi rend="italic">leaded</hi> lattice-window: to me the most venerable of all rooms I ever entered. Luther&#x2019;s old oak-table is there (about 3 feet square), and a huge fossil-bone (<hi rend="italic">vertebra</hi> of a mammoth) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> served him for footstool: nothing <hi rend="italic">else</hi> now in the room did certainly belong to him, but these did. I kissed his old oak-table; looked out of his window (making them open it for me) down the sheer Castle-wall into deep chasms, over the great ranges of silent woody mountains, and tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to myself, Here once lived for a time one of God&#x2019;s soldiers, be honour given here! Luther&#x2019;s Father and Mother, painted by Cranach,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hans and Margarete Luther. Lucas Cranach (<date when="1472-00-00">1472</date>&#x2013;<date when="1553-00-00">1553</date>), painted many portraits of Luther and his associates.</note> are here; excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> old Portraits, the Father with a dash of thrift, contention and worldly wisdom in his old judicious peasant countenance, the mother particularly pious, kind, true and mother<supplied>[ly]</supplied>, a noble old peasant woman: there is also Luther&#x2019;s self, by the same Cranach, a picture infinitely superior to what y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lithograph w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give a notion of: a bold, effectual-looking rustic man, with brown eyes and skin, with a dash of peaceable self-consciousness and healthy defiance in the look of him;&#x2014;in fact one is called to <hi rend="italic">forget</hi> the Engraving in looking at this; and indeed I have since found the Engraving is not from this but from another Cranach, to <hi rend="italic">which</hi> also it bears no tolerable resemblance. But I must say no more of the Wartburg,&#x2014;we saw the <hi rend="italic">place</hi> on the plaster where he threw his inkstand (the plaster itself is all cut out there, and carried off by visitors); saw the outer staircase (which runs close by his door) where he speaks of often hearing the Devil make noises: poor and noble Luther; I shall never forget this Wartburg, and am right glad that I saw it and Marburg.&#x2014; That afternoon, there being no <hi rend="italic">train</hi> convenient, we drove to Gotha <pb id="pg-27-296" n="27:296"/>in a kind of <hi rend="italic">Clatch</hi> (two-horsed), very cheap in these parts; a bright beautiful country, and a bonny little Town (belongs to Prince Albert&#x2019;s Brother,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ernest II (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">93</date>), duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.</note>&#x2014;more power to his elbow): there we lodged in sumptuous rooms in an old quiet inn,&#x2014;the very rooms where <hi rend="italic">Napoleon</hi> lodged after being beaten at Leipzig:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the three-day &#x201C;Battle of the Nations,&#x201C; <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>.</note> it seems, I slept last night where he breakfasted, if that c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do much for me. At noon we came off to Erfurt; a place of 30,000 inhabitants, and now a Prussian fortified town, all intersected with ditches of water (for <hi rend="italic">defence</hi> sake); streets very crooked, very narrow, houses with old overhanging walls,&#x2014;and still the very room in it, where M. Luther hid while a monk; and our Guide-Book said, the very <hi rend="italic">Bible</hi> he found in the Convent Library &#x26; read in this cell! This of the Bible proved <hi rend="italic">wrong; Luther&#x2019;s</hi> particular Bible is not here, but is said to be at Berlin; nothing really of Luther&#x2019;s is there, except the poor old Latticed-window, glazed in lead, the main panes <hi rend="italic">round</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the size of a biggish <foreign><hi rend="italic">snap</hi></foreign> (all bound together by whirligig <hi rend="italic">intervals</hi>); it looks out to the west, over more old cloistered courts and roof-tops, ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a church steeple, and is itself in the second story:&#x2014;except this, and L.&#x2019;s old <hi rend="italic">ink-stand</hi> a poor old oak <hi rend="italic">boxie</hi> with inkbottle and <hi rend="italic">sand</hi>-case in it, now hardly sticking together, there is nothing here that belonged actually to Luther: the walls are all covered over with Texts &#x26;c in painted letters, by a later hand, the ceiling also is ornamentally painted;&#x2014;and indeed the place is all altered now and turned long ago into an Orphan Asylum, much of the old building gone, and replaced by new of a diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> figure. On one wall of the room, however, is again a Portrait of Luther by Cranach; and <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, I found on inspection, was the one your Engraver had been vainly aiming at,&#x2014;vainly, for this too is a noble face, the <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> not turned up in hypocritical devotion, but looking out in profound sorrow and determination, the lips too gathered in stern but affectionate firmness:&#x2014;he is in russet yellow boots, and the collar of his shirt is small and edged with <hi rend="italic">black.</hi> This was the last we saw of Luther; we had to hasten back to our railway-station, and take the next train for Weimar;&#x2014;where a certain Mr Marshall (who had run to Frankfurt to meet me) was waiting for us, and had done all he could in providing Lodgings at the quietest H&#xF4;tel,&#x2014;and here I now write, dear Mother, and all the house except myself seems now to bed. I too ought to go. I will add a word tomorrow before this go, if I have any time at all,&#x2014;but Marshall threatens me with a terrible day of sight-seeing, <hi rend="italic">Goethe</hi>-ing &#x26;c &#x26;c!

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> I get no word from you since the Bonn Letter, rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> at Frankfurt; if anything have arrived at Frankf<hi rend="italic">t</hi> since, it will be waiting for me at Dresden, forwarded thither, where we hope to be in two days hence: at Weimar I can find nothing yesternight nor today; so before going to bed, I will write to you, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will be my best remaining resource in the Letter way. Last night, I sat long, till everything was quiet in this <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gasthof zum Erbprinz</hi></foreign>, writing to my Mother, all about Luther&#x2019;s localities: those of today belong more especially to you,&#x2014;or at all events a word about myself out of them belongs to you. I write within half a gunshot of the <hi rend="italic">Goethe&#x2019;sche Haus</hi> and of the <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x2019;sche:</hi> our own early days are intertwined in a kind of pathetic manner with these two. John has yet written nothing to me. Forster&#x2019;s &#x201C;Paget&#x201C; (or whatever he was) at Dresden refuses also to write in answer hither; he is perhaps absent from Dresden,&#x2014;let him take his time in returning; at Dresden I shall feel it interesting not to see him, if that is his course instead of the other. <foreign>Ach Gott</foreign>, there are plenty of empty headed mortals to <hi rend="italic">see</hi>, at Dresden and elsewhere! But to my Work.</p>
<p>At Homburg we had a quieter time than could have been expected; we staid out our 2 days and 3 nights, under tolerable circumstances; I finished my Books; saw the <hi rend="italic">Schloss;</hi> where are many interesting Portraits, and a whole lot of Books about Friedrich, to the whole of which I might have had access with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> difficulty had it been my cue to stay, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it was not. I also saw the Augustenburgs, and spent an interesting hour with the good Duchess and her two sons and two daughters in a very Babylonish condition as to <hi rend="italic">languages</hi>, but otherwise quite pleasant and luminous: the old gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> sat mostly silent, but <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> genial; the Duchess (whose French seemed bad, and whose German was not clear to me) is a fine broad motherly woman, not quite unlike Mrs Donaldson of Tavistock Square,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note>&#x2014;a Merchantess, Mrs Carlyle!&#x2014;the girls, with their stiff English, were beautiful clear-eyed fair-skinned creatures, and happy in spite of their exile; the sons d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>. It was here that I first <pb id="pg-27-298" n="27:298"/>heard of Wellington&#x2019;s death,&#x2014;the night before we came away:&#x2014;I also fell in with the poor little <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> Wilson, Miss W.&#x2019;s brother,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Thomas Wilson of Upper Eccleston St.</note> and talked sympathetically to the victim of <foreign>ennui</foreign>. In fine, enough of Homburg; and may none of us soon see it again.</p>
<p>Of Marburg the ancient mediaeval and Luther&#x2019;sche Town and Castle, where we stept out of the Railway for 2 hours or 3, be nothing said here; nor of the rail itself, tho&#x2019; it was curious enough, filled with Alsatian miscellanies pilgriming to the Leipzig Fair (which now is): Cassel is a large dull Town; and there, in the best inn, was such an arrang<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> as&#x2014;<foreign>Ach Himmel</foreign>! I shall not forget those cowhorns, and &#x201C;<foreign>H&#xF6;ret ihr Herren</foreign>&#x201C; [Hear ye, Gentlemen]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The night watchman&#x2019;s call.</note> in a hurry. It was a night productive of &#x201C;pangs which were rather exquisite,&#x201C;&#x2014;and nevertheless of some 3 hours of sleep, upon wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> one could proceed, and say, It will not come back. I had also the pleasure to see that Hassenpflug&#x2019;s (the tyrannous, traitorous Court-minion&#x2019;s) wi<supplied>[n]</supplied>dows<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted. Hans Daniel Hassenpflug (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>), chief minister to the electors Wilhelm II and Friedrich Wilhelm I of Hesse-Cassel; his name was a byword for repression. Neuberg wrote to his sister, <date when="1852-09-20">20 Sept.</date>, that in reply to his Cassel landlord&#x2019;s invitation to stay another day and see &#x201C;the artificial waterworks play,&#x201C; TC said, &#x201C;I would not stay even to see Hassenpflug hung, which would be a much greater sight&#x201C; (Sadler 287).</note> were <hi rend="italic">broken</hi>, as we drove past in the morning,&#x2014;towards Eisenach, where again was halt for Luther&#x2019;s and the Wartburg&#x2019;s sake. Of all that, you shall hear enough by and by: enough at present, it was a real gain to me, and I could not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> some worship look out of Luther&#x2019;s indubitable window, down into the sheer abysses over the Castle wall, and far and wide out upon the woody multitude of Hills; and reflect that here was <hi rend="italic">authentically</hi> a kind of great man, and a kind of <hi rend="italic">holy</hi> place if there were any such. In my torn-up sick exasperated humour I could have cried; but didn&#x2019;t. A nice drive of 15 miles bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> us to Gotha, that afternoon: interesting things at Gotha; and best of all 5 hours of a kind of sleep or half-sleep, in a room, which was Napoleon&#x2019;s once upon a time! What think you of that?&#x2014; Next day to Erfurt, and there Luther&#x2019;s Monk-<hi rend="italic">cell</hi>, and a picture of him, and his old <hi rend="italic">ink-stand</hi> and his queer old leaden window and outlook: after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> in 2 hours more of rail in the bright sunday afternoon or ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, day before yesterday,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Weimar;</hi> a little bright enough place, smaller than Dumfries, with three steeples, and totally with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> smoke; standing amid dull undulating country, flat mostly, and tending towards ugliness except for trees. We were glad to get to the inn (by the worst and slowest of <hi rend="italic">clatches</hi>), and there procure some <hi rend="italic">chack</hi> of dinner.&#x2014; Poor Marshall had engaged me the &#x201C;quietest rooms in Germany,&#x201C; ricketty bare crazy rooms (and with a noisy man snoring on the other side of the deal partition) yet really quiet in comparison; where I did sleep last night, and <pb id="pg-27-299" n="27:299"/>hope to do so this. Poor Marshall truly has been unwearied; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take me into Heaven, if it depended on him: good soul, I really am a little grateful, hard as my heart is; and ought to be ashamed that I am not more. Neuberg too, veritably he is better than six <hi rend="italic">couriers</hi>, and is a friend over and above.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here I actually am in Germany, and have been these 3 or 4 weeks; in very great haste and confusion I despatch a line to announce that small fact to you,&#x2014;and farther that I hope to be in Berlin itself (and to see you, if I am lucky) about Tuesday or at farthest Wednesday next. I have come up the Rhine from Rotterdam; have been at Ems, Homburg, Frankfurt, Weimar &#x26;c: this afternoon we go towards Schandau, Lobositz; and after Lobositz, direct to Berlin,&#x2014;I suppose by Zittau &#x26; Frankfurt a. O.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Zittau, Saxon town on the left bank of the Neisse, 46 mi. ESE of Dresden. Frankfurt on Oder, 50 mi. ESE of Berlin.</note></p>
<p>My Wife is not here; she is safe at home, where I wish I too were! Neuberg alone accompanies me; one of the friendliest and helpfullest road-companions man ever had. I have of course seen many interesting things; in fact I have prospered well in all respects, <hi rend="italic">except</hi> that I <hi rend="italic">can hardly get any sleep</hi>, in these noisy bedrooms, in these strange beds: in fact it is now four weeks since I had a night of sound sleep; I am obliged to help myself along with broken sleep, in about half the natural quantity,&#x2014;which circumstance necessarily modifies very much the objects I can hope to attempt with success in this journey of mine. To gather some old Books (on the subject of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi>), to see Portraits and Places, this is nearly all I can aim at, as matters go.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was disappointed in the pictures he saw at Dresden because he was looking for authentic portraits of Frederick. Though taken to see Raphael&#x2019;s idealized Sistine Madonna, he stumped past dismissing it as &#x201C;stinking fish&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi>, trans. 92).</note></p>
<p>Berlin is to be my last station; from Berlin I go home by the shortest route, and at the quickest rate of steam conveyance. I calculate on staying there perhaps a week; longer if I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get a lodging where sleep were possible; but of that I fancy there is no hope? I am habitually a bad sleeper cannot do with noises &#x26;c at all: and the arrangements for sleep, in all German places where I have tried, are eminently unsuitable hitherto.&#x2014; If you or any of your people could advise where <hi rend="italic">a quiet bedroom</hi> was to be had in Berlin, that would be one of the valuablest of favours! At all events, leave a line for me &#x201C;Berlin, Poste Restante&#x201C;; that I may know at once whether you are in Town; and where to find you.&#x2014; And now for the S&#xE4;chsische Schweitz and other confused journeyings!</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> I got your nice little Letter the night before last, waiting for me at Dresden; and right glad was I of it: there came with it one, from John, which had been forwarded from Frankfurt; &#x2014;nothing but favourable news <hi rend="italic">from home;</hi> this, in my painful pilgrimings in foreign parts, is surely a great comfort and blessing! I wrote to you from Weimar, some five days ago; and therefore there is nothing pressing me at present to write; but having a quiet hour here, by the side of the Elbe River, at the foot of wild rock mountains in the queerest region you ever saw, I throw you another word, not knowing when I may have another chance as good,&#x2014;certainly none till we reach Berlin, and find lodgings there. I am on the second floor in a little German Country inn, literally <hi rend="italic">washed</hi> by the Elbe, which is lying in the moonshine as clear as a mirror and as silent: right above us is a high Peak called the <hi rend="italic">Bastei</hi> (Bastion) a kind of thing you are obliged to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> (by Tourist Law); this we have <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, &#x26; are to go tomorrow towards F&#x2019;s first battlefield in the 7-years war; after which the second day (if all go well) will bring us into Berlin. We came by an Elbe Steamer; go on tomorrow at nine by another Steamer, then by railway,&#x2014;and hope to see, tho&#x2019; alas in quite confused circumstances and to little advantage, some of the actual footsteps of Father Fritz, for here too amid these rocks, as well as farther on at Lobositz, he did feats.&#x2014; But let me tell in order; and take up my story where I left it.</p>
<p>The day after I wrote, we were to leave Weimar; but lo, in the morning while we sat at breakfast, little Marshall came in, looking highly animated, with Letters from the Schloss, from &#x201C;the Grand Duchess,&#x201C; from the &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;in short, the said G<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Duchess (<hi rend="italic">Sister</hi> of Tzar Nicholas, and Mother of the Duke who was at Chelsea)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria Paulowna (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), da. of Tsar Paul I (<date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>) and sister of Tsar Nicholas I (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), wife (m. <date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>) of the Grand Duke Karl Friedrich (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>) and mother of Karl Alexander (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1901-00-00">1901</date>), heir apparent, who had visited Chelsea <date when="1847-06-27">27 June 1847</date> (see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470630-TC-JCA-01"><sic>21:246&#x2013;47</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1847-06-30">30 June 1847</date></corr></ref>). Neuberg wrote to his sister, <date when="1852-09-21">21 Sept.</date>, of the invitation to dinner at the ducal castle, &#x201C;(I probably in the character of Sancho Panza, or &#x2018;awful example&#x2019;),&#x201C; and on <date when="1852-09-25">25 Sept.</date> he wrote further: &#x201C;The Grand Duchess is a fine and stately old lady &#x2026; but we noticed that, though she was full of politeness and attention, she never smiled. Carlyle said, &#x2018;Poor soul, the heart is frozen out of her.&#x2019; In driving back he laughed a great deal at the thought of having been at the Grand Duke&#x2019;s in a wideawake &#x2026; . He had no other hat with him&#x201C; (Sadler 288).</note> had seen in the Newspaper that one &#x201C;Carlyle&#x201C; <pb id="pg-27-302" n="27:302"/>was among the arrivals; &#x201C;could this be the <foreign><hi rend="italic">ber&#xfc;hmte</hi></foreign> [famous]&#x201C; &#x26;c&#x2014;in which case naturally he and his companion must <hi rend="italic">come to dinner;</hi> and of course there could be no travelling that day. Well, we did go to dinner; saw how they <hi rend="italic">ackit;</hi>&#x2014;a rather troublesome dramatic affair, of which you shall have full description when I return: enough, it was very sublime and altogether heartless and even dull and dreary, but well worth doing for once. The G<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> Duchess is towards sixty; slightly deaf, and has once been extremely pretty, tho&#x2019; hard always as nails or diamonds: her Husband, a kind of imbecil man (they say), <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> extremely like a gentleman, and has an air of solemn serene vacuity wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is itself almost royal. I had to sit by the Duchess at dinner (3 p.m to 5), and maintain with energy a singularly <hi rend="italic">empty</hi> intellectual colloquy, in French (chiefly), in English and in German; the Lady being half deaf withal, you may think how charming it was. She has a thin croaky voice; brow and chin recede; eyes are blue, small, and of the brightness and hardness of precious stones. <foreign>Ach Gott</foreign>, at last we got away; soon after 5; and I for one was right charmed to think here is one thing over. But it must be owned the honour done me was to be recognised; and I was very glad to oblige poor Neuberg too by a touch of Court-life, which he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not otherwise have seen.</p>
<p>At Leipzig all was raging business, the Fair being in hand; noisy and busy almost as Cheapside London,&#x2014;lots of dim haberdashery, <hi rend="italic">Leather</hi> without end, and all things rolling about in noisy waggons with miniature wheels: to get any sleep at all was a kind of miracle! However, we did tolerably well; got even a Book or two of the list I had formed;&#x2014;drank a glass of wine (one only) in <hi rend="italic">Auerbach&#x2019;s Keller:</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A famous tavern in Leipzig dating from <date when="1530-00-00">1530</date>, the setting for a scene in <hi rend="italic">Faust I</hi>.</note> and at last got safe to Dresden (80 miles off), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was a mighty deliverance, as from the tumult of Cheapside into the solitude of Bath or the New Town of Edin<hi rend="italic">r.</hi> A very interesting old Capital; where, if sleep had been attainable, I could have staid a week with advantage: but alas it was <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, and so I had to plunge along, and save as from a conflagration what little I could of my possibilities;&#x2014;and at length, with gratitude to Heaven, to get away into the Steamer this afternoon; and bid <foreign>adieu</foreign> to Dr<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and its Japan and other Palaces for ever and a day.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Japanese Palace, in the New Town of Dresden, built, <date when="1715-00-00">1715</date>&#x2013;<date when="1717-00-00">17</date>, as a summer residence for King Augustus II, and so called because of the oriental figures decorating it.</note> Paget did write to me in time; I saw Paget and found him full of eagerness to help; saw one Noel also (Lady Byron&#x2019;s Nephew, who boasted to have known me in Chelsea);<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Ralph Noel, author of books on phrenology, lived with his wife, Louisa, the Austrian Baroness Haitzinger, in Dresden.

Poor B&#xF6;lte, who is still in the Auerbach&#x2019;s house, sole mistress there, made a small ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> party (chiefly of &#x201C;learned historical men&#x201C;) for my behoof; very good people, but of no use to me or next to none:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amalie B&#xF6;lte wrote to Varnhagen, <date when="1852-09-22">22 Sept.</date>, that she still did not know whether TC was coming to Dresden; and on <date when="1852-11-05">5 Nov.</date> she wrote again to say that TC arrived the day after her last letter and to give an account of his visit, for which she had arranged a group of people who might interest him, including Karl Eduard Vehse (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>), historian, who for political reasons had been banished from Prussia; John Lothrop Motley (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">77</date>), American historian, living in Dresden and other European cities while preparing his <hi rend="italic">The Rise of the Dutch Republic</hi>, 3 vols.

After sleepless nights TC was extremely impatient. See <hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 92&#x2013;93. Varnhagen made notes about TC&#x2019;s visit to Germany, and wrote: &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle came to Dresden in the autumn <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>. Sick, weary, and irritable, he went to bed early. B&#xF6;lte however had asked a few people in to meet him, among them the English Captain Noel, who engaged the tired traveller in a lengthy conversation, trying to bring him round to his own democratic opinions, which was very vexing to Carlyle, who responded briefly and in a restrained manner but in such a way as to cut the matter short. But after his reply Noel began again and commenced a long exposition, on which Carlyle took out his watch, looked at it with patience and, paying no attention to arguments, waited out his prescribed time, which when it came and his watch showed nine o&#x2019;clock he stood up, put his watch away and, with the words &#x2018;Good Night Mr. Noel,&#x2019; went to his bedroom&#x201C; (MS: Jagiellonian Univ., trans.).</note> she looks calmer, better-coloured, much more like a lady than she used to do in London; this day I called again to take leave of her; and was really affected to see over her Desk a Portrait in water-colours of &#x2014;&#x2014; have you any notion whom?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably of JWC; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490703-JWC-TC-01"><sic>24:91</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1849-07-03">3 July 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note> Poor soul, after all.

It is very tragic indeed.&#x2014; &#x2014; I am sorry to <hi rend="italic">blot</hi> this poor scrawl, but<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS returns to f. 380 from 381.</note> really it seems as if I could n&#x2019;t help it, so untowardly is my ink, and other apparatus. No <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> was ever heard of in these rooms; hardly even in the kitchen can one see the colour of fire; and their writing they dry with <hi rend="italic">sand.</hi></p>
<p>A taproom with some 20 rustic <hi rend="italic">gents</hi>,* enjoying cards, beer and bad cigars for the last hour or two, seems now to have winded itself up; and things are growing stone-quiet in this establish<hi rend="italic">t:</hi> Neuberg has long since retired to his room;&#x2014;and I now must address myself to the task of falling asleep.&#x2014; We go tomorrow at 9,&#x2014;Lobositz (in Bohemia), Zittau (Lusatia), Frankfurt <hi rend="italic">am Oder</hi>, Berlin,&#x2014;that is the projected route, but liable to revisal.</p>

<p>The sprig of heather was plucked for you at the foot of the Bastie in &#x201C;Saxon Switzerland,&#x201C; so-called; let it also go, and accept it from me.

<p><salute>By this time, Dear, you will have got my letter to Dresden.</salute> I wrote there according to your <hi rend="italic">first</hi> instructions. Since then, I have been rather pleased that uncertainty about your whereabout afforded me a fair excuse for observing <pb id="pg-27-305" n="27:305"/>silence. In all my life I was never in a state more unfavourable to letter-writing! so &#x201C;entangled in the details&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;John&#x2019;s phrase&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> and so continually out of temper. I have often said that I couldn&#x2019;t be at the trouble to <hi rend="small-caps">hate</hi> anyone, but now decidedly I hate one man&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan! His conduct has been perfectly shameful, not a promise kept, and not even an apology made for breaking them. I have ceased to write to him, or send any messages to him&#x2014;I merely pray God to &#x201C;very particularly damn him&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Old McTurk, on paying his reapers at evening (who had taken to &#x2018;kemp&#x2019; and spoiled him much stuff), said to each, with the 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>, &#x2018;God damn you!&#x2019; and to one old woman (originator of the thing), &#x2018;And God particularly&#x2014;&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, ye b&#x2014;&#x2014;!&#x2019;&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>). &#x201C;Taken to kemp&#x201C; competing with each other at reaping.</note>&#x2014; The Carpenters Bricklayers and Plasterers are all gone out of the house; there are still some odds and ends for the Carpenter to do, and the Bricklayers will be needed <hi rend="italic">outside</hi>&#x2014;but the only work doing for the last week has been <hi rend="italic">painting.</hi> and tho&#x2019; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan promised that two more painters should be sent to help the one already here, that promise has gone <foreign><hi rend="italic">ad plures</hi></foreign> [to the majority; i.e., dead]&#x2014;neither will he send back the paperhanger to finish in the staircase&#x2014;With this <hi rend="italic">one</hi> painter it was impossible to do all that was needed, before your return&#x2014; So I have had to give up the painting of the lower rooms&#x2014;too thankful to get them thoroughly cleaned once more, and refurnished. Fanny and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Heywood<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified.</note> were two days washing the old paint, while I cleaned the paper&#x2014;and two days more it took us to bring the furniture to its old condition&#x2014; The new room is cleaned out and has the old furniture in it&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; sufficiently <hi rend="italic">bare</hi> looking, will not be uninhabitable during the winter, and when it is papered and furnished prettily it will be a very <hi rend="italic">fine</hi> room indeed&#x2014;Chalmers<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Rich man of next door; an endless builder, renovator, and decorator of No. 4&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> said with a look of envy that we couldn&#x2019;t have got a house with such a room in it under 150&#xa3; a year&#x2014; The new bedroom up stairs is still representing &#x201C;the belly of Chaos&#x201C; all things thrown out of their old places finding refuge there&#x2014;but my old bedroom will be &#x201C;better than I deserve&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Coleridge&#x201C; (note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> till the other is ready&#x2014;the bed is up there&#x2014;without curtains but the work of rehabilitation is going on in it&#x2014;so that it will be ready for sleeping in when one <hi rend="italic">can</hi> safely sleep in the house at all&#x2014;which is not the case at present the new paint in the stair cases poisoning the whole house And <hi rend="italic">your</hi> bedroom!&#x2014;Ah! that has been the cruellest cut of all!&#x2014; I had <hi rend="italic">it</hi> painted the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> thing that it might be well aired for you and the presses you wished for, which they would not make on the spot but <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have made at the work shop were ordered and promised to be all painted <hi rend="italic">there</hi> to save us the smell&#x2014;and behold after keeping me up with this delusion for <hi rend="italic">six weeks</hi> they <pb id="pg-27-306" n="27:306"/>bring them home in raw wood!&#x2014;declaring they <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not be painted till they were fixed up&#x2014;and so that room where I had been sleeping for a week had to be again abandoned &#x26; I could not bring the sofa in the parlour again for the passage was all in wet paint&#x2014;and I felt myself growing quite ill&#x2014;got up every morning with a sick headach and had got back my old <hi rend="italic">sickness</hi> thro the day&#x2014;which I had hoped was gone for <hi rend="italic">good.</hi> So there was no sense in staying on till I took a nervous fever or some such thing&#x2014; I went off, then, on a new hunt for lodgings and found a decent little appartment next door to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Thorburn&#x2014;whose house was fully let I have the ground floor and my bed is quite free of &#x201C;small beings&#x201C;&#x2014;an unspeakable mercy!&#x2014;indeed it is a very comfortable little bedroom tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">feebly</hi> furnished&#x2014;and the people very decent quiet people.

Three <foreign>flittings</foreign> they say is equal to a fire&#x2014;but a &#x201C;thorough repair&#x201C; is equal to three fires!&#x2014; Oh dear (in case I forget) Masson&#x2014;Masson is quite frantic at having received no testimonial<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;London professorship; I sent him one from Berlin&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>); see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521001-TC-CUCL-01">TC to CUCL, <date when="1852-10-01">1 Oct.</date></ref></note> from you&#x2014;the election takes place on the 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> so pray try to write to him in time I promised to tell you his ardent wish so soon as I knew where to hit you with a letter&#x2014;I see hardly any body&#x2014;going no where&#x2014; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Weber has called <hi rend="italic">4</hi> times (!) without finding me&#x2014;two of the times I was in the house&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">au secret</hi></foreign> [hidden]&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear John</salute>
<p><foreign><hi rend="italic">Quelle vie</hi></foreign> [What a life]! Not yours but mine! You, I hear from some who saw you &#x201C;never looked so well nor were in such good spirits&#x201C;&#x2014;Naturally!&#x2014;if a man don&#x2019;t look well and be in good spirits <hi rend="italic">before</hi> his marriage what is to be expected <hi rend="italic">after?</hi> But I who am not going to be married, I don&#x2019;t &#x201C;look well&#x201C; at all, and my spirits, and <hi rend="italic">Neros</hi> too are at the lowest. In fact &#x201C;I am degenerating from a man into a dog, and feel an inclination to bark&#x2014;bow, wow, wow&#x201C;! Oh Heavens! if there be one corner in the bad place hotter than another dont I wish M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan may get it! He is now keeping the house poisonous week after week, because it dont suit his interest to send me more than <hi rend="italic">one</hi> painter&#x2014; It might all have been painted that was to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> painted this year two weeks ago, and the smell pretty well gone&#x2014;instead of having that detestable process drawn out to the time of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s return&#x2014;besides keeping me back in my efforts to restore order. Certainly if Job had taken the notion of having &#x201C;his house <hi rend="italic">made habitable</hi>&#x201C; and had Morgan given him for Architect, he <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have done as his Wife advised him to do<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Curse God, and die&#x201C; (Job 2:9).</note>&#x2014; It is maddening&#x2014;quite&#x2014;this unending <hi rend="italic">muddle</hi>, complicated by the probability of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C returning to find the house reeking with new paint! and so much still at sixes and sevens! I fled here a week ago to save&#x2014;if not my <hi rend="italic">soul</hi>&#x2014;at least my <hi rend="italic">body</hi> alive! I awoke every morning with a headach at home, and had my old <hi rend="italic">sickness</hi> all day long&#x2014;so in spite of my sad nights among the &#x201C;small beings&#x201C; (as Mazzini calls them) in Cheyne Walk I went in quest of a new <hi rend="italic">lodging.</hi> M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Thorburn was full, but there was a ticket in the window of the next house, and I looked in there and was content with the appearance of things&#x2014;I have the lower floor both sitting room and bed room&#x2014;so that I might come here even in the day time when I could not stand the smell at home. I have always gone home to breakfast however, which Fanny has very tidy for me <hi rend="italic">in the kitchen</hi> by eight o&#x2019;clock and I dine there early, returning here to early tea, when I am tired out with working. The amount of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> which this upset has cut out for one is quite <pb id="pg-27-309" n="27:309"/>incredible! Fanny has been my greatest temporal comfort! she is not without a dash of Irish confusion in her but her good humour is unexampled in my experience of Servants. And she is a very fair cook and fair servant of <hi rend="italic">all work.</hi> I am infinitely obliged to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Thompson<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the Dr. Thompson John Carlyle knew in Rome, now settled in London (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380412-TC-JAC-01"><sic>10:65</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1838-04-12">12 April 1838</date></corr></ref>), or Dr. Theophilus Thompson (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">60</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27277"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), physician to the Marlborough St. Consumption Hospital, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>, who introduced cod liver oil and other useful medicines.</note> for having kept her alive. Do you know William Fraser is lying ill&#x2014;dying it is thought&#x2014;in the Middlesex Hospital?

She seems excessively vexed that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had not awaited his death to marry <hi rend="italic">her.</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C seems to be getting very successfully thro his travels, thanks to the patience and helpfulness of Neuberg&#x2014; He makes in every letter (they are not many) frightful <foreign><hi rend="italic">misereres</hi></foreign> over his sleeping accommodations, but he cannot <hi rend="italic">conceal</hi> that he is really pretty well, and gets sleep enough to go on with, more or less pleasantly. I wonder what he would have made of my sleeping accomodations during the last three months? Do you know anything of a D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Weber. He went with the Ashburtons to Swizerland to take care of Lord A when he was ill, and Lady A talks of him with enthusiasm&#x2014;nay with <hi rend="italic">tears</hi> in her eyes!! And he is &#x201C;the finest tenor singer in private life&#x201C;!&#x2014; He came to see me at Lady A&#x2019;s desire and&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">saw me!</hi>&#x2014;and he looked down into the bottom of my eyes as if he meant to take my whole soul captive but my soul had something else to do than be so taken&#x2014;and he has since called <hi rend="italic">five times</hi>!! without seeing me. three times I was really <hi rend="italic">out</hi> and twice too dirty to be <hi rend="italic">at home</hi>&#x2014;and he is &#x201C;Physician to the Austrian Embassy and in extensive practice&#x201C;!

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>Here, after various adventures, not of a romantic nor of a very pleasant or victorious nature, I have arrived at last, about a week <hi rend="italic">after</hi> expectation; very glad indeed that the job is so far on;&#x2014;not otherwise very glad, for the day is pouring wet, and these streets are as loud almost as Piccadilly, and greatly muddier &#x26; worse paved; and in the stupid houses (which look like granaries <pb id="pg-27-310" n="27:310"/>many of them, or low-walled warehouses) there is no soul whom I have much curiosity to see,&#x2014;only one old, memory of a soul perhaps; and in the search after that it is not easy to make much progress, I fear. I find a grand statue of the Old Fritz (really excellent) riding in the chief street, surrounded with Marshals and Generals of note; I have seen two of his Battlefields, Lobositz in Bohemia, scene of his first victory, and Cunersdorf<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kunersdorf (now Kunowice in W Poland), 4 mi. E of Frankfurt on the Oder, where Frederick was defeated, <date when="1759-08-12">12 Aug. 1759</date>, by the Russians and Austrians in the Seven Years&#x2019; War.</note> of his worst defeat: but to get any real <hi rend="italic">sight</hi> of the man and his existence, especially while men are helping me by talk &#x26;c to do it, is beyond measure difficult. I must restrict myself to that Problem however; and done or not done, get home out of these tumults: Berlin shall have a week from me, perhaps a week good measure; and after that, presto, by Hanover, by K&#xF6;ln and Antwerp, home, home, and try to get a little sleep once more!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Exactly this day fortnight, at Cassel, under bad circumstances tho&#x2019; with loyal mind, I wrote your Ladyship a semi-legible despatch, announcing among other things that I was to be in Berlin &#x201C;probably in six days&#x201C; from that time: the Letter was posted next day at Eisenach, and so has now had 13 days to air itself in the world:&#x2014;and yet, and yet alas, there is no Letter from you here at the Post-Office for me this morning; none, and either some mischance has happened, or you have forgotten to be gracious, as of old! Pray write at once, if you have not written. I shall in all likelihood be here till a letter can arrive, and at all events it will be taken care of, and sent after me, if I am gone. About Radowitz<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Maria von Radowitz, Conservative Prussian gen., friend and adviser of Crown Prince Friedrich William, former foreign minister and prime minister, known for his early advocacy of German unification; he had visited Britain in <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>.</note> &#x26;c I am not anxious: but, ah me, a word of friendliness, tho&#x2019; of that too I cannot be doubtful from you, would be welcome, in these foreign semi-articulate regions I am now inhabiting!&#x2014; Also if Lord A do want any <foreign><hi rend="italic">Bestellungen</hi></foreign> [commissions] (Engravings, books of Art &#x26;c)&#x2014;which I rather think is not the case,&#x2014;let him speak at once, and I will follow his directions to the utmost of my ability. I am, for my own behoof, collecting old Books, a work of great difficulty to select any grains of corn from such a mass of chaff as there is; and am at any rate upon the market where such things have currency and are to be heard of. Only speed is necessary!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have been in the Wartburg, where Luther lived as <hi rend="italic">Junker Georg</hi>, and worked at translating the Bible: his old room is still there, unchanged, his old oak-table, the very floor he walked upon; the window he looked out of (into sheer abysses, over lonely mountains, into uncertainties, immensities and eternities),&#x2014;poor old fellow: I felt that there was not probably in the Earth a <pb id="pg-27-311" n="27:311"/>more truly <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi> spot than that same; and I did my worship (being in a <hi rend="italic">sleepless</hi> excited condition) with great fervour there. We were next in Gotha, and then&#x2014;three days in Weimar itself, Schiller&#x2019;s old writing-table (the correct image of your model at The Grange, or rather <foreign><hi rend="italic">vice-vers&#xe2;</hi></foreign>) is still there; his little poor harpsichord and beside it poor bed where he died, picture of his face when dead: that room also is rather memorable to me. Goethe&#x2019;s House was opened by favour; nay the reigning powers (seeing us in the Newspapers) invited poor Neuberg and me to dinner; and we went in spite of my &#x201C;shocking bad hat&#x201C; (a dusty wide-awake, which I hid dexterously below stairs): the &#x201C;reigning Duchess,&#x201C; a sister of the Czar<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Written above &#x201C;Emperor,&#x201C; which is not crossed out.</note> Nicolaus, is a woman worth seeing,&#x2014;highly polite and gracious tho&#x2019; unluckily a little deaf, and cold as polished steel!&#x2014;poor female-soul, her Husband is a big gentlemanly-<hi rend="italic">looking</hi> man, who <hi rend="italic">does</hi> his parade-drawing room duty with consciencious perfection; but is otherwise considered imbecile, with him in this limited histrionic scene, has the Sister of the Czar Nicholas had to lead her tragic fact of an existence, and make no complaint about it: she has small blue eyes, the <hi rend="italic">hardest</hi> I ever looked into, a weak unmusical voice, a <hi rend="italic">circular</hi> profile (receding chin and brow), a thin tall figure; and is, on the whole, she and her polite colloquy (in bad French, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> English, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> German) more like a respectable <hi rend="italic">ghost</hi> to me than anything I have ever met with. The young people, whom you have seen, were &#x201C;away in Italy&#x201C;: with them, except looking at their pictures &#x26;c was no trade. At length we got away: but on the whole, Weimar, with its silent stagnation from all real business, with its solemn inanities and dilettantisms, with its very Goethe threatening to become a bigger Lytton Bulwer,&#x2014;O Heaven what a tragedy was that of Goethe to me, of such a man driven <hi rend="italic">thither</hi> for such a life!&#x2014; Weimar, I say, is still a puzzle, and a kind of nightmare, in my imagination!&#x2014; After Weimar, and next to it, came, of all things, Leipzig Fair; a noise as of Cheapside or Thames Street, and masses of Jews, dealing mainly, I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in dim muslins and leather: a deafening, distressing scene: next Dresden, where a nest of English, &#x26; Foreign Dilettanti turned up, with B&#xF6;lte in the middle of them; of whom silence: Dresden is a decayed <foreign>beau</foreign>; has <hi rend="italic">once</hi> had sow-lace about its hat and coat, and has still the &#x201C;manners of a gentl<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x201C; but evidently next to no money in its purse, and looks quite faded and battered in spite of all its graciosities; in fact one sees that Prussia ought to take possession of that country (as the sensible people in it are said to wish), and that the &#x201C;Saxon Dynasty&#x201C; has <hi rend="italic">played</hi> its card, and has now only to retire in some graceful way. I was heartily miserable in Dresden, with such a set of objects buzzing round me,&#x2014;in such dreadful hurry too, and no sleep to be had. However I did manage to ascertain the locality of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi>&#x2019;s Siege in some approximate degree; and the good Dilettanti people (friendly <pb id="pg-27-312" n="27:312"/>and helpful, wretch that I am!) took me, on the request, to the top of the highest steeple, and there with my eyes I saw far and wide, and can remember, if it avail.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;One of the rapidest and most furious sieges anywhere on record,&#x201C; <date when="1760-07-00">July 1760</date>, <hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 18:235.</note></p>
<p>Of the &#x201C;Saxon Switzerland&#x201C;; of Lobositz which is in Bohemia, the <hi rend="italic">Ireland</hi> of Germany; of T&#xF6;plitz (beautifully <hi rend="italic">vacant</hi> when we saw it, and capable of being slept in); of Zittau and Stell-wagons [coaches]; of Frankfurt on the Oder, nay of <hi rend="italic">Herrnhuth</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Herrnhut, village in NE Saxony, seat of a persecuted colony of Moravians who settled there in <date when="1722-00-00">1722</date>; recalled in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:166&#x2013;67.</note> I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> speak, having your ladyship under my thumb,&#x2014;but will not, being of a merciful nature.&#x2014; In fine, I have seen many things that are not quite with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> value; everybody has been kind to me; and except want of sleep I have suffered nothing physical that is worth speaking of; but&#x2014;but, on the whole, I do wish it were done; and I think, were I once home again, it will be a while before I &#x201C;travel&#x201C; more, under what conditions soever it be. Oh my dear Friend, what a <hi rend="italic">life</hi> this is; what a life, take it where one may!&#x2014; From Jane I found a Letter today: she seems well; but has had again to fly the house &#x201C;for paint, smells and painters; and is overwhelmed poor soul, with the confusions of that &#x201C;thorough repair&#x201C;&#x2014;may we never see <hi rend="italic">its</hi> match again! But surely it will pass too; surely things <hi rend="italic">will</hi> mend a little,&#x2014;a very little were worth recognising as a favour of the Destinies just. O Lady, oh my Lady, I am sunk and buried under rubbish in these days and weeks, and feel as if the heart were quite crushed dead in me; and can only say in the sorrow of my soul, <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Friend, and <hi rend="italic">may</hi> we meet soon when times are better!</salute></closer></p>

<p>I have had the honour of some considerable acquaintance with Mr. &#x201C;Masson for a good many years, and am well pleased to have this opportunity of testifying my high sense of his merits under all points of view. It is my clear opinion nobody can know him without feeling that he is a man of truly <pb id="pg-27-313" n="27:313"/>superior qualities, calculated at once to secure good success in his undertakings, and the love of his fellow-creatures by the way. A man of many attainments in scholarship and literature; and with a natural fund of intelligence, delicate, strong and deep, such as belongs to very few, even among scholars and men of letters. A man of beautiful and manly character withal; ardent, vivid, veracious, and yet altogether quiet, discreet, and harmonious; likely to be distinguished, I should expect, at once by love of peace, and by felicity and steadiness in doing work. For he is full of what one might call central <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>, which is singularly well <hi rend="italic">covered in</hi>, and tempered into genial <hi rend="italic">warmth</hi>, of many useful and beautiful kinds.</p>
<p>Mr. Masson&#x2019;s Writings, chiefly criticisms and essays in reviews hitherto, are beginning to be well known in the world. Some of them I could point to,&#x2014;especially to one on Milton,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Works of John Milton</hi>,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">North British Review</hi> <date when="1852-02-16">16 (Feb. 1852)</date>: 295&#x2013;335. Masson, who was appointed, later wrote a well-known life of Milton.</note> written several years ago,&#x2014;as among the best, if not even as the very best, that British Literature exhibits at present. If there is not promise of excellence in Mr. Masson, I know not where, among our young men of letters, to look for it in these coming years.</p>
<p>In fine, if the Electors are not quite unusually fortunate in candidates, I think they surely may do well in nominating such a man to the Chair of English Literature in the London University; a post for which, I should expect, only few could be as fit.</p>

<p><salute>Well, my poor little Goody, here you see we are;</salute> at the <hi rend="italic">summit</hi> of these wanderings; from which, I hope, there is for me a swift <hi rend="italic">perpendicular</hi> return before long, not a slow parabolic one as the ascent has been. We came four-and-twenty hours ago, latish last night, from Frankfurt on the Oder, from the field of Cunersdorf (a dreadful scraggy village, where Fritz rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> his worst defeat) and various toils and <foreign><hi rend="italic">strapazen</hi></foreign> [hardships]; very weary in a damp kind of night; and took shelter in the readiest Inn, from which we have just (half an hour ago) removed to this better, at least far grander one,&#x2014;where <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> there are beds one can sleep in, and the butter is not bitter;&#x2014;alas, <pb id="pg-27-314" n="27:314"/>such sorrows attend the wayfarer; and his first refuge is to sit down and write, if haply he have any one to whom his writing will give a feeling of pity for him! This morning I got your letter at the <hi rend="italic">Poste Restante</hi>, with one from Varnhagen (mere wind-music), and one from Miss Wynne, who appeared to be <hi rend="italic">here</hi> in this very Inn where I now write, and who warmly recommended us to come to the same. Alas, we called at this Inn so indicated, on our way home; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Miss Wynne <foreign>ist heuter abgereist, morgens fr&#xfc;h um 7 Uhr, nach Dresden</foreign></hi> [Miss Wynne departed today, the first thing at 7 o&#x2019;clock, for Dresden]!&#x201C; So ended our chace of Miss Wynne: last night we might have seen her, and would, could the letters have been got at so late an hour; but today she is gone, and our paths do not cross again at all. There was truly in Berlin nobody whom it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have given me so much satisfaction to see. Oh Goody, Goody dear! I do wish these sleepless joyless sad and weary wanderings were at an end! As by Heaven&#x2019;s help they now soon shall be.</p>
<p>And you too, poor little weary soul, you are quite worn out with that accursed &#x201C;thorough repair&#x201C;: would to Heaven we had never thought of it, but lived in the old black house we had, where at least was no noise of carpenters to drive one mad, no stink of paint to poison one. Driven out of the house again, and sleeping solitary in a little lodging: I declare it quite makes me sad to think of it;&#x2014;and Morgan, if Morgan is the fundamental cause of it, deserves to be, as you pray, &#x201C;particularly damned.&#x201C; Confound him,&#x2014;and confound the whole confused business, this abominable sorrowful and shockingly expensive tour to Germany included! But no, rather let us have patience, my Dear; we shall find that the rooms will come right by and by, and all fair toil on them be repaid; nay that the shockingly expensive tour to Germany, too, may pay its expenses one day. Nevertheless I do grieve for my poor little Jeannie and her horrible dusty botherations; and if she get thro&#x2019; them well,&#x2014;as I know she will, after all,&#x2014;it will be a double praise to her, and to me a double and a treble pleasure, when all this chaff is gone down the wind again. Ah me, ah me!&#x2014; But let me narrate, as usual,&#x2014;only with greater brevity.</p>
<p>From Lobositz to Toplitz the last Letter bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> you,&#x2014;letter written in the so-called &#x201C;Saxon Switzl<hi rend="italic">d</hi>,&#x201C; and posted at that empty watering place amid the Bohemian Mountains, a place truly of adventures to us; which shall be forthcoming one day. No English, scarcely any civilized traveller seems to have accomplished the 30 or 40 English miles which lie between Lobositz and Zittau (the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of the next railway): we had a strange and strangest day of it in slow German <hi rend="italic">stell-wagens</hi>; and in fact were horribly tired, before the thing in general ended by a seat in the soft-going swift and certain railway carriage, and the Inn at <hi rend="italic">Herrnhut</hi> where we had to wait 4 hours of the stillest life you ever saw or dreamt of! <hi rend="italic">Herrnhut</hi> (Lord&#x2019;s Keeping) is the primitive and still central city of the Moravian brethren: a place not bigger than Annan, but <pb id="pg-27-315" n="27:315"/>beautiful, pure and quiet beyond any Town on the Earth, I dare say, and indeed more like a Saintly dream of Ideal Calvinism made real than a Town of stone and lime where London Porter (not needed by <hi rend="italic">me</hi>) is to be had for money. I will tell you ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Herrnhuth too some day, for it is among the notable spots of the world, and I retain a lively memory of it. But not of it, nor of dreary moory Frankfurt and its Cunersdorf villages, and polite lieutenants (for a Prussian Lieut<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Adjutant knew <hi rend="italic">me</hi> there, by &#x201C;fame,&#x201C; and was very polite with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> knowing me) not of this, nor of any other phenomenon will I now speak&#x2014;in fact, I am dead stupid; my heart nearly choked out of me, and my head churned to pieces; and I can, and should, write of nothing till once I got a little sleep again.</p>
<p>This morning, finding <hi rend="italic">lodgings</hi> the first thing to be tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of, after Letters from the <hi rend="italic">Poste Restante</hi>, I sent Neuberg out on that quest, I myself staying at home to write Masson&#x2019;s Testimonial (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I did, sorrow on it, and hope it will still be in time): I had not yet finished, when poor N. returned, not with news of lodgings, but (in spite of my express prohibition) with Varnhagen to pay his compliments! Varnhagen is a hale, whitehaired, sexagenarian, of sturdy figure, and official-gentlemanly aspect; fully a cleverer man than I expected, with a dash of something hard and cunning in his eyes, at least something <hi rend="italic">worldly</hi> which reminded me of the late L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Ashburton, whom otherwise with his slightly turned-up nose, melodious official voice and solid-looking but unsteady figure he a little resembled or seemed to resemble. We talked very merrily, I in bad German, understanding every word of his good, for about an hour; when he went his way, with many flourishes, and a solemn invitation to Fr&#xE4;ulein Solmar&#x2019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note>&#x2014;which I have neglected preferring to write to you, and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> only Neuberg has accepted. The rest of the day passed sorrily in fiddling to and fro ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Lodgings,&#x2014;poor N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> is not good at coming to an issue in such cases, tho&#x2019; full of zeal and good-will; and in short after upping and downing a good deal, we decided to give up the notion of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">private</hi> lodgings,&#x201C; and come to this H&#xF4;tel where Miss Wynne had been, there to stay out our week, in proper state, at least with fair prospects, if the Fates are kind and the streets not too noisy. I will not close till tomorrow; and can then report what kind of night there has been.&#x2014; I ordered a <hi rend="italic">hat</hi> today,&#x2014;was not that a feat?&#x2014; and got measured for it by an ingenious man, a citizen of the French Nation; very shifty men these are. I also made a violent attempt to buy a pair of gloves; thrice I repeated the attempt, but thrice the gloves wouldn&#x2019;t fit, and I was foiled. This and dining in a <foreign><hi rend="italic">r&#xE9;stauration</hi></foreign> (on bad mutton chop with bread and Bordeaux wine, amid thick volumes of tobacco smoke) is really all the work I have done today, sinner that I am.&#x2014; Berlin is <hi rend="italic">loud</hi> almost as London, but in no other way great among the greatest. I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> guess it ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the size of Liverpool, <pb id="pg-27-316" n="27:316"/>and more like Glasgow in the straight openness of its streets. Many grand public edifices about this eastern end of the Town; but on the whole it looks in many quarters almost shabby, in spite of its noise and paint, so <hi rend="italic">low</hi> are the houses for a Capital city, more like warehouses, or malt kilns with the very chimnies wanting (for within is nothing but stores). This <foreign><hi rend="italic">unter den Linden</hi></foreign> (under the lime trees) is the one good street of the place; as if another Princes-street at 300 hundred yards distance and with tree-rows between them ran parallel to the Princes street we know: it is on the north side of this we live; grand rooms indeed, and not dearer than an Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> lodging or nearly so dear as a London one, 2 guineas a week (1 guinea each): here in Heaven&#x2019;s name let me consider <hi rend="italic">what</hi> I can do in Berlin, and with my whole strength if any strength is left me strive to do it. Heigho! what a blotting on this unfortunate paper, the last leaf but one that I have of this good kind of paper,&#x2014;blotting that will not be available for writing to you farther. Neuberg too has come in, and crept modestly away to his room; never was there a more modest patient self-denying man,&#x2014;to whom I must go and speak a word before bed-going. Good night, dear Jeannie mine, God bless thee ever; and may thy bit of sleep be good in Hemus Terrace, and may it soon change to Cheyne Row again, mine too. <hi rend="italic">Amen.</hi></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The Letter you wrote me did not come to hand at Frankfurt whither it was addressed; but I got it safely at Dresden, the people having sent it on, according to order: one of Jane&#x2019;s addressed &#x201C;Dresden&#x201C; found me there the same evening, about a week ago; and right glad I was of both, as you can believe. This is now the fourth evening since we got to Berlin,&#x2014;by a circuitous and painful route, due to the great Fritz and his Battlefields;&#x2014;and now at length I propose to give a more deliberate little word than I could write in Weimar, in Bonn or Rotterdam, about my travelling experiences. A short word; but one that will be welcome to my good old Mother and the rest of you.</p>
<p>Weimar, from which, if I recollect rightly, my last letter was dated,&#x2014;proved to be a laborious agitating place, and detained us 3 days in all, which were, if not pleasant by any means, yet very strange, and will long be memorable to me. The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> day was added partly or wholly by accident: the reigning Powers having heard of our existence somehow, proposed a Dinner, and we couldn&#x2019;t decline; but <hi rend="italic">went</hi>&#x2014;to Belvedere of the Weimarese,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The summer palace.</note>&#x2014;and witnessed one of the loftiest pieces of Histrionism off the Stage; not to be repeated in a hurry! The old G<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Duchess (<hi rend="italic">Young</hi> Duke &#x26; Wife were in Italy) is the Sister of the Russian Czar; quick witted, courteous, rather deaf, and for the rest all made of hard French-polish into the very heart:&#x2014;positively I have not yet got my mind made up about that phenomenon in general, and feel only as yet that it was in the highest degree <hi rend="italic">tragic.</hi> Schiller&#x2019;s house and Goethe&#x2019;s; and the tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that their lives had lain in such a Scene made the matter worse and worse. Weimar is quite a little spiritual puzzle to me.&#x2014; &#x2014; At Dresden we found B&#xF6;lte<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were letters to B&#xF6;lte after this meeting since she mentioned receiving one from JWC, who reported to B&#xF6;lte&#x2019;s annoyance that TC and Neuberg said she was looking &#x201C;feminine&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi>, 93).</note> and other Sages and Dilettanti English and Foreign; and ran about, &#x201C;like mad,&#x201C; seeking information and getting next to none; at length we climbed to the top of the highest Church steeple, and at least <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> with our eyes what kind of scene it was we had got into. A beautiful old City; but quite faded and reduced; evidently going back in the world, and wearing, like Bath, the air of a decayed <foreign>beau</foreign>,&#x2014;stately, poor, with lace tarnished and purse grown light. I saw where F<hi rend="italic">k had been</hi> however,&#x2014;if that can do any good to me, I have acquired that. Of Lobositz, T&#xF6;plitz and the Bohemian Border Regions, still more of the &#x201C;Saxon Switzerland,&#x201C; I will say nothing at all,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; this Lobositz adventure cost us 2 days beyond calculations, and some of the queerest <pb id="pg-27-318" n="27:318"/>experiences we had yet had in Germany. Zittau at length again connected us with <hi rend="italic">Railways;</hi> we went thro&#x2019; Herrnhuth (4 hours there), thro&#x2019; Frankfurt on the Oder (1 day there, and on the field of Cunersdorf,&#x2014;compared with which <hi rend="italic">Creca Moss</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Creca Moss is 4 mi. NE of Annan.</note> is as the Carse of Gowrie): finally to <hi rend="italic">Berlin</hi> itself, as I said;&#x2014;and properly to within sight of the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of these sad wanderings. For after a few days spent here, the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> I can, which will not be very <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, I have all along intended and do still intend to <hi rend="italic">rush</hi> directly home, and try for a little rest at Chelsea after all these sublime sights I have had! Heigho, <hi rend="italic">Oh whow!</hi> I declare I am terribly wearied, for one thing: and repose, under the humblest circumstances, will be of all things the desirablest to me. I have seen Pottsdam, Sans souci &#x26;c<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The palace built by Frederick II, nr. Potsdam, 17 mi. SW of Berlin.</note> &#x26;c, am seeing and doing what I can; and profess only to hope that, in a week or so, I may be under way again, with my nose homeward. Doubtless there are many things here that I might <hi rend="italic">learn</hi>, if not ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> yet about Prussian life, if I chose to stay and resolutely <hi rend="italic">try:</hi> but in fact it is not worth while; &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Was thut&#x2019;s</hi></foreign> [What is the need]? What&#x2019;s ta use on&#x2019;t?&#x201C; And I so weary too, and living continually as in a kind of nightmare in these strange foreign days.</p>
<p>The fatigues of this German journey,&#x2014;especially the <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> departments of the business,&#x2014;have by no means been less than I anticipated; and to think that my health either of body or of mind w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> ever &#x201C;improve&#x201C; by such a course of action and suffering, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very vain. Nevertheless I suppose I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> gained something, were the handful of wheat once separated from the mountain of chaff: at all events I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> the thing; and it will not start up with promise, in my own eyes or those of others, inviting me to do it again. The German <hi rend="italic">beds</hi> especially are quite a new experience in life to a thin skinned sleeper! Were I to live a thousand years, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hardly forget these miraculous machines, I think; and all Christian beds shall henceforth be dearer to me, and honourable however humble, on their account!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Dear Brother, I read what you wrote on that <hi rend="italic">private</hi> subject of your own, you may be sure, with profound interest; and I may add, since your mind has come to that deliberate decision, with <hi rend="italic">good augury</hi> for my own part,&#x2014;with what depth of good wishes you do not require to be told. God bless you and the good Partner you have chosen; and may it be for good to you and her (as I truly think it will) and not for evil! I feel as if I could <hi rend="italic">cry</hi> at present; but I will not.&#x2014; Jane had written me about the matter, and writes often, keeping me on a level with events; she anticipates, as I do, great possibilities of advantage to you. No more of it at present, but the best wish of my heart to you and the other party interested;&#x2014;and as Mr Croaker said, &#x201C;This time twelvemonth may we all like it as well&#x2014;&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goldsmith, <hi rend="italic">The Good Natur&#x2019;d Man</hi>, Acts 1 and 5, cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340627-TC-AC-01"><sic>7:226</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1834-06-27">27 June 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> and better!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-319" n="27:319"/>Berlin, a big noisy city (kind of cross between Paris and an immense Congeries of Maltkilns set in rows, for the streets are mean, low &#x26; the houses have no chimnies), has yet yielded me almost nothing; sight of a few Portraits at best; but I have now (by the Ambassador Bloomfield&#x2019;s aid) admittance to use the library Books <hi rend="italic">at home</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c; and hope, with effort, to get a little better on. Varnhagen has been to me, and I have returned his call; but in him is no help at all: a lively-talking, pleasant, <hi rend="italic">official</hi> kind of man; I understand every word of his German, and feel with regret how little <hi rend="italic">it</hi> can do for me. Poor fellow, he is ten years older than myself; and has had many <foreign><hi rend="italic">Strapazen</hi></foreign> [hardships] too; for the rest, a <foreign><hi rend="italic">r&#xfc;stiger alter Kerl</hi></foreign> [hearty old fellow], with cunning grey eyes, turn-up nose, plenty of white hair, and a dash of dandy, soldier-citizen and sage (or, if you had ever seen the men <hi rend="italic">both</hi>, a mixture of Stewart Lewis<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stewart Lewis (<date when="1756-00-00">1756</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>), Scottish poet; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18150201-TC-TM-01"><sic>1:37&#x2013;38</sic><corr>TC to TM, <date when="1815-02-01">1 Feb. 1815</date></corr></ref>, and later.</note> and Leigh Hunt): that is Varnhagen; and he goes to some Miss Something&#x2019;s <foreign>soir&#xE9;e</foreign> every night,&#x2014;whither I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> never follow him, and &#x201C;don&#x2019;t intend to.&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; Tell my dear Mother, I hope to write to her from Chelsea before long; if I continue long here I will write <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> but don&#x2019;t you till you hear. <closer><salute>Blessings on one and all</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>I write, Dear, since you bid me write again;</salute> but upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour it were better to leave me silent, all the thoughts of my heart just now are <hi rend="italic">curses</hi> on M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan. I have not a word of comfort to give; I am wearied and sad and cross; feel as if Death had been dissolved into a liquid and I had drunk of it till I was full! Good Gracious! that wet paint should have the power of poisoning one&#x2019;s soul as well as one&#x2019;s body! But it is not the wet paint simply; it is the provocation of having an abominable process spun out so interminably and the prospect of your finding your house hardly habitable after such long absence and weary travel. Never in all my life has my temper been so tried! so anxious I have been to get on, and the workmen only sent <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, seemingly, when they have no where else to go&#x2014;and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan dwindled away into a Myth!&#x2014;Not once have I seen his face! I will have your bedroom at least in <pb id="pg-27-320" n="27:320"/>order for you, and if the smell of the staircase is too bad you must just stay the shorter time here. Lady A wrote to invite us to the Grange on the 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x2014;for &#x201C;a long visit&#x201C;&#x2014;and I have engaged to go&#x2014;myself for <hi rend="italic">a week</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ten days</hi> but if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I said could stay longer it would be all the better for <hi rend="italic">you!</hi> We shall see how it <hi rend="italic">smells</hi> when you come, and need not make long programmes. For myself I have been sleeping <hi rend="small-caps">about</hi> at home again&#x2014;have done so since Monday gone a week&#x2014; I had to give up my snug little lodging suddenly and remain here for &#x201C;reasons&#x2014;which it may be interesting not to state.&#x201C; as <hi rend="italic">the</hi> painter (only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> can I get) paints me out of one floor I move to another&#x2014;but I have slept <hi rend="italic">oftenest</hi> in the back parlour, on the sofa, which stands there in permanency, and which with four chairs and a quantity of pillows I have made into an excellent bed&#x2014; But surely it were more agreeable to write of something else&#x2014; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Weber then!&#x2014; What D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Weber means I am at a loss to conjecture; but that he comes here oftener than <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> is a positive fact&#x2014;after the <hi rend="italic">five</hi> ineffectual visits he made a sixth which was successful. I was at home, and he stayed an hour and half!! looking so lovingly into my eyes that I felt more puzzled than ever. Is it to hear of Lady A he comes? I thought, and started on that topic; but he let it drop without any appearance of particular interest. &#x201C;He is an Austrian&#x201C; I thought again, and all Austrians are born spies, Reichenbach said; he may know I am the friend of Mazzini, and he wanting to find out things of <hi rend="italic">him.</hi> So then I brought in the name of Mazzini but that also was <hi rend="italic">no go</hi>&#x2014; When he was going away he said &#x201C;in a few days I will do myself the honour of calling again&#x201C;!! I did not want him to be taking up my time in the mornings so I said &#x201C;it was the merest chance finding me at present in the mornings&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;At what time then may I hope to find you?&#x201C; In the evenings, I said, but it is too far for you to come then&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh not at all&#x201C;!&#x2014; Better <hi rend="italic">fix</hi> an evening I thought and have somebody to meet him&#x2014;so I asked him for wednesday&#x2014;and had Saffi and Reichenbach here&#x2014;and both were charmed with him, as well they might for he took &#x201C;such pains to please&#x201C; us&#x2014;actually at my <hi rend="italic">first</hi> request, <hi rend="italic">sang</hi> to us <hi rend="italic">without any accompaniment</hi> Today he has been here again with his wife, a pretty ladylike rather silly young woman&#x2014;whom Lady A has taken into favour. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Brookfield called yesterday&#x2014;of the same genus&#x2014; The Captain<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A. Sterling&#x201C; (Note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> is come to town, and is on his good behaviour for the moment&#x2014; He says he was keeping a journal of his travels in Scotland but when he found no letter from <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at Oban where he had begged me to write, he &#x201C;dropt his journal&#x2014;never wrote another word&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have had no accounts from John very lately&#x2014;entangled in the details no doubt&#x2014;indeed I get almost no letters&#x2014;not having composure or time to write any&#x2014;Geraldine has been some weeks in the Isle of Man, making love to some cousin (a D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>) she has there, and even she has fallen mute</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-321" n="27:321"/>Last Sunday I thought I had got a letter! Oh worth all the letters that this earth could have given me&#x2014; I was tumbling two boxfuls of my papers into one large box, when the desire took me to look into my Fathers daybook which I had never opened since it came to me wrapt in newspaper, and sealed, from Templand<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The daybook was Dr. Welsh&#x2019;s daily account book, now in the Jane Carlyle House Museum at Haddington.</note>&#x2014; I removed the cover and opened it, and fancy my feelings on seeing a large letter lying inside addressed M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle in my Mothers handwriting&#x2014;with three unbroken black seals of her ring!&#x2014; I sat with it in my hands staring at it, with my heart beating, and my head quite dizzy&#x2014; Here was at last <hi rend="italic">the letter</hi> I had hoped would be found at Templand after her death! Now&#x2014;after so many years&#x2014;after so much sorrow!&#x2014; I am sure I sat ten minutes before I could open it&#x2014; And when I did open it, I could not <hi rend="italic">see</hi> to read anything&#x2014; Alas! it was not that wished for letter of farewell&#x2014;still it was <hi rend="italic">something.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Deed</hi> was there, making over my property to her,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250719-JBW-GW-01"><sic>3:352&#x2013;53</sic><corr>JBW to GW, <date when="1825-07-19">19 July 1825</date></corr></ref> for <sic>JWC</sic><corr>JBW</corr> to GW [<date when="1825-07-19">19 July 1825</date>], when JWC sent her the &#x201C;deed&#x201C; or disposition and assignation (<date when="1825-07-19">19 July 1825</date>) of Craigenputtoch and the Haddington house, confirming the disposition and settlement of <date when="1824-01-30">30 Jan. 1824</date>. See also Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 1:82-83, who is misleading, in a chapter headed &#x201C;<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>.&#x201C; When JWC&#x2019;s father died intestate in <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>, his land (including Craigenputtoch and the Haddington house) went to his da. as heir, with the requirement that her mother should have one-third of the rent for life, after which it would revert to JWC. A. Carlyle explains (<hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 1:2; <hi rend="italic">CL</hi> 3:352&#x2013;55) that on being told that if she herself should die intestate, her mother&#x2019;s rights to her portion would probably be contested, JWC first made the provisional settlement of <date when="1824-01-30">30 Jan. 1824</date> giving her mother the life rents of Craigenputtoch and the Haddington house, with a &#x201C;deed&#x201C; to much the same effect on <date when="1825-07-19">19 July 1825</date>. TC was also to have the prospect of Craigenputtoch on her mother&#x2019;s death. The term &#x201C;will&#x201C; is loosely used, and evidently means these legal documents. JWC generously did not want TC to feel that he was marrying even a minor &#x201C;heiress.&#x201C;</note> and written inside the envelope were a few words&#x2014;&#x201C;When this comes into your possession my dearest Child do not forget my Sister&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie Welsh (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>).</note> / G W May / Templand <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x201C; beside the <hi rend="italic">deed</hi> lay my letter which accompanied it and a long long letter also mine&#x2014;most sad to read&#x2014;about my marriage some Copies of letters also in my Fathers writing and a black profile of him&#x2014;on the whole I felt to have found a treasure tho&#x2019; I was dreadfully disappointed too&#x2014;and could do nothing all the day after but cry.</p>

<p>Last night I took to crying <hi rend="italic">again</hi> at this point, besides it was more than time to go <hi rend="italic">to</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">bed</hi> (figuratively speaking) And now I have my <hi rend="italic">all work</hi> to attend to. Fanny continues the best tempered of creatures, and her health keeps pretty good thro all the mess&#x2014;so that decidedly one may hope she will be equal to our needs in the <hi rend="italic">normal</hi> state of things.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>It is now the seventh day that I am in Berlin: this day week, namely, we were at Frankfurt on the Oder, and the &#x201C;blasted heath&#x201C; of Cunersdorf where Frederic received his worst defeat from the Russians,&#x2014;not even a blasted <hi rend="italic">heath</hi> that Cunersdorf, for it is <hi rend="italic">sand</hi> and will not carry heath, and several of the &#x201C;hills&#x201C; have been <hi rend="italic">blown away</hi> since Fritz was there; certainly the wretchedest of all terrestrial Hamlets,&#x2014;there we were last Thursday about this hour; and came to Berlin the same night. Of course you are often in my thoughts here, oftener than usual; for I was to have seen all these things along with you, and to have done much else; had the Powers that preside over Travel been propitious; but they were not; and all the revenge I can have is to write you a word or two (under highly difficult circumstances as usual!) before I go hence.</p>
<p>Some Note from My Lady I had counted on finding here; but there has none come; which fact has of course given rise to various considerations on my part: however, I will not let myself believe that it proceeds from new <hi rend="italic">illness</hi>, either on her part or yours; and so it shall be of no consequence to me, and only a very temporary business, as my return home is now to be speedy. Radowitz, I believe, is just come or about coming to Berlin: it appears there are easy methods of getting to him if I much wanted it; but I by no means much do; it is, rather, as My Lady prophesied, a task to keep the people off me,&#x2014;airy people (possessed of much more enthusiasm than I!) full of officious zeal, and who can do me no good at all.</p>
<p>I carried your letter to Lord Bloomfield on Saturday last,&#x2014;wanting some service from him in regard to the Royal Library;&#x2014;and was at once admitted to an interview, and very kindly received indeed both by himself and by his Wife, to whom also, it appears, her good Sister M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Villiers had recommended me. I have since seen them again; they asked me to dinner, and I went to tea;&#x2014;found there a little English Party, and had a pleasant hour or two, and some talk with the Diplomatist himself; whom I find to be a solid honourable <pb id="pg-27-324" n="27:324"/>English character; very fit (I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> suppose) for his post, and with far more sense in him than he cares to express in talk. With him I am very glad to have made this little bit of acquaintance; his service in regard to the Library too was at once granted me, and has been essentially useful in the affair of books,&#x2014;enabling me to carry books <hi rend="italic">home</hi> with me, and read them (had I any time!) not under headache and foul air, but in quiet and with my windows open. In short I am much obliged to you for what you did in this matter. His Lord<hi rend="italic">p</hi> asked me, when last there, if I wanted to know anybody? <foreign>Ach Gott</foreign>, no! Why sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I know anybody, except those that could help to expedite the wretched task I am here upon, and let me end it sooner and get home again!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Berlin has beautiful Royal and other Public Buildings; two or three really handsome squares, with trees and statues in them; and this street, &#x201C;under the Lime-trees,&#x201C; which resembles, tho&#x2019; afar off, <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Edinburgh Princes Streets set to front one another, is a handsome lively street: but as a whole, the City has a rawboned awkward bare appearance (so many <hi rend="italic">low</hi> houses, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> chimnies, and deep <hi rend="italic">ditches</hi> by way of gutters on each side with unsteady wooden lids to them),&#x2014;occasionally it reminds you of Paris, then again of some nondescript Congeries of warehouses and maltkilns, some Manchester <hi rend="italic">without</hi> the industry, or any <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi> save that of bad tobacco, which penetrates all corners and sanctuaries, and seems to be here what Liberty of the Press was defined to be in England, &#x201C;the air we breathe, if we have it not we die!&#x201C;&#x2014; Soldiers greatly abound everywhere; the very <hi rend="italic">cabmen</hi> have a kind of brass helmet: the <hi rend="italic">noise</hi> of this and some other streets is very great; but seems chiefly to proceed from <foreign><hi rend="italic">droschkas</hi></foreign> [four-wheeled cabs], and the carting of wood, peat &#x26;c for fuel, add to which that the pavements are very bad.</p>
<p>In my inquiries after Fritz I have not been very victorious; but I have done my best, and everybody has been willing, if not many able, to be of real help to me. A lot of old Books the good Neuberg has managed to fish up for me out of the dark shops here: that has been one&#x2019;s chief acquisition in most cities hitherto. Localities I have seen, tho&#x2019; indistinctly and under fearfully stupid guidance for most part (having no time to search for guides): Pottsdam for most part seemed dreadfully ugly, a place for bull frogs rather than men; but Sanssouci itself and the <hi rend="italic">Neue Pallast</hi> [New Palace] (of Fritz&#x2019;s building there) are both decidedly pleasant places; have wood, dry ground (Sanssouci even a <hi rend="italic">hill</hi>) and wear an <hi rend="italic">expensive</hi> and fantastic if not a beautiful or completely royal appearance. Charlottenburg and Spandau,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlottenburg, nr. Berlin, the palace of Queen Sophia Charlotte (<date when="1668-00-00">1668</date>&#x2013;<date when="1705-00-00">1705</date>). Spandau, a suburb, residence of the Electors of Brandenburg.</note> a certain learned Artist here (one Magnus,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eduard Magnus.</note> Professor of something, and &#x201C;the best Portrait Painter <hi rend="italic">in the world</hi>,&#x201C; say the Berliners), who has been very kind to me, and has actual <pb id="pg-27-325" n="27:325"/>sense in him,&#x2014;he is to shew me over these places this very day; and that nearly <hi rend="italic">ends</hi> my visiting of &#x201C;places,&#x201C; thank God!&#x2014; In finding likenesses of Fr<hi rend="italic">k</hi> and his Generals and Intimates, tho&#x2019; running after that as the one thing doable here (besides gathering of books), I have not been successful at all: indeed nobody <hi rend="italic">can</hi> succeed, for the Portraits do not exist anywhere as a collection, but are scattered over the whole country, and of many personages nobody can give you notice of a Portrait existing anywhere. In the Royal Palaces and Collections of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunst-Sachen</hi></foreign> [art objects], there is little but a beggarly account of empty boxes on that head: <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Portrait of Fr<hi rend="italic">k</hi> as a young man, five or six times repeated with insignificant variations, by a contemporary called <hi rend="italic">Pesne:</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Antoine Pesne (<date when="1683-00-00">1683</date>&#x2013;<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>), premier portrait painter under Frederick II. See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 15:frontispiece.</note> that is literally all that I can recollect of truly superior quality that refers to him in these long galleries: of his <hi rend="italic">people</hi> there is no trace whatever to be found there,&#x2014;holy families, Rape of the Sabines, flaying of Bartholomew &#x26;c &#x26;c stand there instead. Here too one is obliged to be content with what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> attainable; and so leave that of the possible, the <hi rend="italic">might-be</hi> sphere, with a sad but transient sigh.</p>
<p>Nay in a private house here, one Schickler&#x2019;s the Chief Bankers of the place,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gebr. Schickler, Berlin banking firm, founded <date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>. Varnhagen noted: &#x201C;In Berlin Carlyle also dined with the banker Magnus who had invited a very brilliant company. &#x2026; The conversation came around to Goethe and after much had been said in his praise and his greatness universally acknowledged <supplied>[one of the guests]</supplied> could no longer contain himself but broke out reproachfully with devout expression and gestures regretting that such a great man and gifted spirit should have been without the blessing of belief and not devoted his talent to honoring God the Almighty. Several others agreed vehemently with what had been said and Carlyle had already become restless and made angry faces. At last he laid both arms emphatically on the table and leaning forward began in his slow heavy way and with his halting German in a loud voice: &#x2018;Gentlemen!&#x2014;Do you now know&#x2014;any of you&#x2014;the old story&#x2014;about the man who abused the Sun&#x2014;because he could not&#x2014;light his cigar&#x2014;at it?&#x2019; Those present were startled into silence&#x201C; (MS: Jagiellonian Univ., trans.). The host was probably one of Eduard Magnus&#x2019;s brothers; they came of a banking family.</note> I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> found a Portrait of Fred<hi rend="italic">c</hi>,&#x2014;guided by my Professor Magnus,&#x2014;which seems to me completely <hi rend="italic">final</hi> on that subject, and worth all that I had ever seen before of him or shall see. Really an admirable Portrait; kitcat shape, half the size of life, painted by one Graaf of Dresden,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Anton Graff (<date when="1736-00-00">1736</date>&#x2013;<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>), renowned painter of some 1,500 portraits, mainly active in Dresden.</note>&#x2014;to whom F<hi rend="italic">c</hi> did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sit, but who had watched him everywhere for many years, and who was the best painter in Germany of that day. This Portrait pleased and surprised me not a little; for even Rauch (the Sculptor who did the grand <hi rend="italic"><foreign>Denkmal</foreign></hi> [monument] here, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is full of Portraits)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Daniel Rauch. His monument of Frederick, opposite the palace on the Unter den Linden, was said to be the grandest in Europe.</note> assured me he knew of <pb id="pg-27-326" n="27:326"/>no good Portrait of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi>,&#x2014;and appeared never to have heard of this, till my guide Magnus mentioned it to him. A noble old silverheaded man, this Rauch, nevertheless,&#x2014;tall, clear, clean as aether; 76 years old and with a smile in him like 16! He and Cornelius, another Painter,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter von Cornelius (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>), resident in Berlin since <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, credited with establishing a German school of painting and reviving interest in murals. Neuberg wrote his sister, <date when="1852-10-05">5 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Everywhere, for earnestness and power, Carlyle forms a striking contrast to most of the people whom we meet. He remarked, &#x2018;We lead a pretty fast life here.&#x2019; We are just come back from a dinner-party, consisting of <supplied>[among others]</supplied> &#x2026; the painter Magnus, and our old friend Cornelius. Carlyle made all kinds of side-thrusts at the painters, with their pictures of Christ and their Madonnas; and Cornelius several times called him &#x2018;a godless man.&#x2019; Nevertheless the two have learnt to appreciate one another&#x201C; (Sadler 288&#x2013;89).</note> are the men of most mark I have seen here; indeed the only 2 that seem worthy of much memory from me. And this Portrait of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> is by far my best conquest in that depart<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of my business&#x2014; Magnus incidentally mentioned that he was getting or was about to get it <hi rend="italic">copied</hi> for the Russian Demidoff;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prince Anatoli Nikolaevich Demidov (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>), Russian traveler, philanthropist, and art patron; m. to Matilde (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>), da. of Jerome Bonaparte.</note> I inquired the price of that operation,&#x2014;&#xa3;40; which is too dear a sum for me, tho&#x2019; Demidoff will have a bargain of it if well done.&#x2014; &#x2014; In the line of Art, all else I have done has been to examine some thousands of Chodowiecki Prints (they pronounce him <hi rend="italic">Cod-ov-yetski</hi>); he seems to me the cleverest man since Hogarth&#x2019;s time;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hogarth (<date when="1697-00-00">1697</date>&#x2013;<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>), English painter and engraver.</note> really a man of <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> with his burin: but I do not, for practical objects, find that any of his, still less of other people&#x2019;s prints will much avail me; or that I can reasonably buy, or desire the buying of any &#x201C;Berlin <hi rend="italic">Art</hi>&#x201C; at all for my own poor interests: such is really the fact; and let My Lady and you, in spite of your munificence, understand it to be actually such. Alas! the whole subject of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> is trampled into mire in my mind, in these sad disastrous days and operations; and I do not really believe I shall ever find anything to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> about him,&#x2014;why should I? <foreign>Ach Gott</foreign>, let him lie there trampled down under the dreary Pedants of his own and his country&#x2019;s producing,&#x2014;and let me get home again, and try for a little <hi rend="italic">sleep!</hi>&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; The day after tomorrow, I hope to set out: Hanover, K&#xF6;ln, Ostend,&#x2014;Chelsea itself by the middle of next week! Tell My Lady if she <hi rend="italic">have</hi> written anything hither, it will follow me; and that I hope to see you both soon at Bath House some evening!</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> there has no Letter come from you this morning, as I fondly calculated there might have done; neither, I fear, will any now come: &#x2014;in fact perhaps you had not anything to say to me, but what was already said: what could a letter have done for me? There are Painters and tumult still within hearing of your poor little citadel; perhaps you are still an <hi rend="italic">out</hi>-lodger, much-suffering, much-endeavouring little soul;&#x2014;Heaven grant there have not any illness come upon you: that I will not believe, haggard as my imagination is in these days! No, I shall find you well, and good to me; and with a harbour out of all our Morgan tribulations either attained or close in view. At all events, thank God these wretched travellings of mine are now on the point of ending: by the mercy of Heaven, <hi rend="italic">these</hi> are nearly over, whatever is to follow them: this is, according to all calculation, the <hi rend="italic">Last</hi> Letter I shall send you out of foreign parts for some time. We set out tomorrow; leave this restless Babel of a place tomorrow; <hi rend="italic">straight</hi> towards Ostend and England; and by the best estimate I can form, I may hope to arrive sometime in the day (<hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> forenoon) of <hi rend="italic">Wednesday first;</hi> and then fling down my walking-gear, none <hi rend="italic">willinger</hi> to do it, and try to get a little rest again at last!&#x2014; The proper <hi rend="italic">hour</hi> (or even day?) I cannot quite predict to you, as I should have liked to do: I have urged and tried; but Neuberg is unusually unsuccessful, or unusually remiss in spite of all urging; and <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> find a Foreign Bradshaw here, at least does not: so all that is certain is, We do leave Berlin tomorrow (Saturday the 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi>); go by Brunswick, by Hanover, Cologne; and so far as can be <hi rend="italic">guessed</hi>, Neuberg will leave me at Cologne (Bonn is only 20 or 30 miles off) on Sunday night; and from thence on <hi rend="italic">Tuesday ev</hi>g at Ostend I find a Steamer direct for London; and this, in 17 or 20 hours more, is (if all go well) to land me at the Thames Custom house, and speedily thereafter Cadogan Pier, and poor old Cheyne Row (little antre where I hide in this world) will see me again. Nay it is <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> I may even come the day before (on Tuesday namely): but that is not likely; and will happen only if my impatience and insomnolence rise to such a pitch that I travel on from Cologne with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> rest at all, and by a route that is <hi rend="italic">longer</hi> (round by Dover namely) tho&#x2019; done in less time. Sorrow on the man that will not enable to settle and <hi rend="italic">fix</hi>, that I might <hi rend="italic">say</hi> decisively and save you the fuss of waiting!&#x2014; I will keep this open; and question him again more strictly before this go to post. In my own person I can do no more for certainty in the affair. Don&#x2019;t fret yourself at any rate; be quiet till you do see me, poor Nero and you!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have had a terrible tumbling week at Berlin,&#x2014;O what a month in general <pb id="pg-27-328" n="27:328"/>I have had; month of the profoundest, ghastliest <hi rend="italic">solitude</hi>, in the middle of incessant talk and locomotion!&#x2014;but here, after all, I have got my things not so intolerably <hi rend="italic">done;</hi> and have accomplished what was reasonably possible. Perhaps it will not look so <hi rend="italic">ugly</hi>, when once I am far away from it! In help from other people there has been <hi rend="italic">redundancy</hi> rather than defect: one or two (especially a certain &#x201C;Herr Professor Magnus,&#x201C; the Chief Portrait-Painter here) have been quite marvellous with their civility. And on the whole it was usually rather a relief to get an hour (as now) to one&#x2019;s own self, and be left to private exertions and reflexions merely,&#x2014;<foreign>Ach Gott</foreign>!&#x2014;Yesterday I saw old Tieck:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ludwig Tieck (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), German poet, novelist, playwright, and critic. Varnhagen noted in <date when="1853-06-00">June 1853</date>: &#x201C;Tieck told me that he was absolutely bowled over, almost astonished at Carlyle, who visited him here. He looked miserable, despite his ruddy complexion, his clothes were unkempt in the extreme, and his behavior boorish. And it was obvious that he was not unconscious of his state, but that he was heedless of it. At the start of the conversation Tieck mentioned the name of Coleridge, at which Carlyle broke out into unnatural laughter which was offensive. But when Tieck asked him in cold earnest, &#x2018;What is the reason for your laughter?&#x2019; Carlyle at once stopped short and said with a grave tone and expression, &#x2018;Oh no, I know full well there are many serious things one could say about Coleridge,&#x2019; etc. It was a fair enough question but it received no answer at all. Foolish affectation! On the question of his complaints about travelling and inns, no quiet bedrooms to be had, no four-posters, that we hadn&#x2019;t the very books on Frederick the Great that he would like to have seen, that he could get to see or hear nothing here for the purpose of his journey, on the distorted view he had of the importance of the great king&#x2014;Tieck shrugged his shoulders sympathetically and said it was better that Carlyle should not write upon him&#x201C; (MS: Jagiellonian Univ., trans.).</note> beautiful old man; so serene, so calm, so sad: I have also seen Cornelius, Rauch &#x26;c including Preuss the Historian of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi>,&#x2014;all men, in short, for whom I had any use;&#x2014;nay they had me in their Newspapers it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> appear; and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> gladly make a lion of me, if I liked. A lion that can get only half <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> is not the lion that can shine in that trade; so we <hi rend="italic">decline.</hi> The Ambassador house has also been very good to me; got me into the Library with liberty to take Books home; invited me to dinner,&#x2014;but Magnus had engaged me before, and I could only make it <hi rend="italic">tea;</hi> no matter that, for they were all <hi rend="italic">English</hi> commonplaces when I went. Lady Ashburton wrote (at Frankf<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I think) that when she <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> I was fairly on the road to Berlin, she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> write to Radowitz &#x26;c: I did let her Ladyship hear (unless the Note miscarried), and in consequence I expected some movement from Radowitz or her in these parts; but there has nothing whatever of the kind taken place: which, on the whole, has been a <hi rend="italic">convenience</hi> to me rather than otherwise; Radowitz except as a <hi rend="italic">sight</hi> (and not much as that) being completely nothing to me, or even less in this pressure of persons; which again if L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Ashburton had written ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> his <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunstsachen</hi></foreign> [affairs in fine arts], I must have done something; and truly <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> on that hand has answered better.&#x2014; Heigho, here has Magnus been, with a <hi rend="italic">Print</hi> of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> (small, <pb id="pg-27-329" n="27:329"/>scrubby but rare) by way of <foreign>Andenken</foreign> [souvenir]; and I must run to take <hi rend="italic">farewell</hi> of the Ambassador (which will cost me 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of cab-hire in the wet day);&#x2014;and, on the whole, I must <hi rend="italic">end</hi> for the present and say Good b&#x2019;ye, Good b&#x2019;ye&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">5 p.m.</hi>&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eccovi</hi></foreign> [Lo]!

<salute>My dear John</salute>
<p>The last letter you got from me lay here two days before it got posted&#x2014; I was put in what Anthony Sterling calls &#x201C;a state of mind&#x201C; and forgot it in my pocket&#x2014; It was written at Hemus Terrace, that letter, late at night&#x2014;and after writing it I went to bed, and I awoke with a bad headach, and when I got up at my usual hour (six oclock) I reeled about like &#x201C;a drunk&#x201C; (as Mazzini would say) But as no coffee or attentions were to be expected <hi rend="italic">there</hi> I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> go home to breakfast as usual, and after splashing my head with cold water succeeded in getting my clothes on. When I opened the front door it was a deluge of rain, and I had only thin silk shoes with holes in them, and no umbrella&#x2014; A beautiful outlook with a sick headach! I rang the bell and implored the Landladys daughter to lend me a pair of clogs and an umbrella, and these being vouchsafed me I dragged home, thinking resolutely on the hot coffee that Fanny would have all ready for me, to be taken at the kitchen fire, and the kind sympathy <pb id="pg-27-330" n="27:330"/>that she would accompany it with&#x2014;on reaching my own door I could hardly stand, and leant on the rails till it was opened. Fanny did not open it but a M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Heywood who had been assisting in the cleaning for some days&#x2014;a decent, disagreeable young woman&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh!&#x201C; she said, the first thing, &#x201C;we are so glad you are come! Fanny is in such a way! the house has been broken into during the night, The Police are now in the kitchen&#x201C;! Here was a cure for a sick headach! and it <hi rend="italic">did</hi> cure it! &#x201C;Have they taken much&#x201C; I asked &#x201C;Oh all Fannys best things and a silver table spoon and a table cloth besides&#x201C;!&#x2014; A mercy it was no worse! in the kitchen stood two police sergeants, writing down in a book the stolen items from Fanny&#x2019;s dictation, she poor thing looking deathly&#x2014;There was no coffee of course&#x2014;no fire even&#x2014;every thing had gone to distraction. The thieves had come in at the Larder window which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan had kept <hi rend="italic">without a frame</hi> (!) for three weeks&#x2014;the bolts on the outside of the back kitchen door had saved the whole house from being robbed&#x2014;for Fanny slept sound and never heard them&#x2014; They had taken her nice new large trunk out of the back kitchen into the larder broken off the lock and tumbled all the contents on the floor carrying away two shawls two new dresses and a variety of articles&#x2014;along with the spoon which had unluckily been left after creaming the milk for my tea, and a tablecloth (good) which had been drying Nero&#x2014;they had also drank the milk for my breakfast, and eaten a sweet cake baked for me by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Piper!&#x2014;but they had not taken one half of Fanny&#x2019;s clothes which are all excellent&#x2014;nor three sovereigns which she had lying wrapt in a bit of brown paper at the bottom of her box&#x2014;nor a good many things of mine that were lying open in a basket for the Laundress, and which they had also tumbled on the floor, nor many little things lying about in the back kitchen which would have been useful to them. Whence I infer that they had been frightened away&#x2014;Fanny tho&#x2019; not <hi rend="italic">conscious</hi> of having heard them said that about midnight &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">something</hi> awoke her,&#x201C; and she stretched out her hand for her handkerchief which lay on a table at her bedside, and in so doing knocked over the brass candlestick which &#x201C;made a devil of a row&#x201C;&#x2014;doubtless <hi rend="italic">that</hi> had disturbed them, or we should have lost more&#x2014; As it was Fannys loss amounted to four sovereigns, I computed, which of course I gave her, tho she was not expecting poor thing to be compensated&#x2014;and kept declaring she was thankful it was her and not the Mistress that had lost most&#x2014; My dear there were dirty prints of naked feet all over the larder shelf on which they stept from the window a piece of the new shelf <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> with a candle that had been stuck to it&#x2014;a mercy the fine new house was not set on fire&#x2014;Policemen, four of them, kept coming in plain clothes and in Uniform for the next three days talking the most confounded nonsense&#x2014;and then died away <foreign><hi rend="italic">re infecta</hi></foreign> [nothing done] not a trace of any of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">corpus delicti</hi></foreign> found&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Chambers<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Chalmers, 4 Cheyne Row.</note> had a <pb id="pg-27-331" n="27:331"/>pair of heavy <hi rend="italic">steps</hi> carried over his wall and applied to a window of No 1 the same night&#x2014;and a pair of bad worsted stockings left in his Conservatory&#x2014;the carrying away of the steps proved there had been more than one thief, as they were too heavy for one to take over a high wall&#x2014;the window at No 1 was got up a little way but stuck there. Almost every night since, some house in the immediate neighbourhood has been entered or attempted and still the Police go about &#x201C;with their fingers in their mouths&#x201C;! Of course I no longer went out to sleep&#x2014;but occupied the sofa below where the paint was least noxious&#x2014; Fanny was thrown into such a nervous state that I was sure she would take a nervous fever if she were not relieved from all sense of responsibility&#x2014;which could only be thro my own presence in the house So I declined M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Pipers offer to come and sleep here&#x2014;instead of me&#x2014; Besides, as they had <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> our open condition&#x2014;ladders of all lengths lying in the garden and all the windows to the back except the parlour ones absolutely without fastening (!) I had considerable apprehensions that they would return in greater force&#x2014;and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Piper his Wife confessed to me&#x2014;&#x201C;would be useless against thieves as he slept like a stone.&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> sleep lightly enough for such emergencies and if I had to wait several days before the carpenter would return to put on the fastenings, I could at least furnish myself with a pair of loaded pistols&#x2014; Capital good ones lie at my bedside every night&#x2014;the identical pistols with which old Walter of <hi rend="italic">the Times</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently John Walter (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), chief proprietor and ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, who had employed Edward Sterling (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), from whom the pistols came; the duel is not identified.</note> was to have fought his duel which did not come off&#x2014;bars of iron I got put in the larder window next day independently of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Morgan&#x2014; In a day or two more these bothering <hi rend="italic">ladders</hi> will be taken away&#x2014;and then when I go to the Grange on Friday M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Piper can come for the consolation of Fannys imagination and sleep as sound as he likes&#x2014; I took care to let all the workmen and extraneous people about know of my loaded pistols&#x2014; The Painter came and examined them one day when I was out and said to Fanny &#x201C;I shouldnt like to be a thief within twenty feet of your Mistress with one of these pistols in her hand&#x2014;I shouldnt give much for my life; she has such a devil of a straight eye&#x201C;!! These workmen have all had to suffer a good deal from my &#x2018;<hi rend="small-caps">eye</hi>&#x2019; which has often proved their foot rules and leads in error&#x2014; In writing to Isabella tonight I said nothing of all this in case of frightening your Mother nor have I told M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle in case she<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, for &#x201C;he.&#x201C;</note> should take it in his head to be uneasy&#x2014;which is not likely but just possible</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have been roving about, on the Continent etc, for the last 3 months; only returned last night; and did not see your obliging little Note, which appears to have been so shockingly neglected till this moment! Pray excuse my unpoliteness; which, you perceive, is rather a misfortune than a crime on my part.</p>
<p>Of course I should be very happy indeed to have those or any Letters of Cromwell corrected to the uttermost on such terms. It is even my duty to neglect no opportunity of having all his Letters made more and more correct.</p>
<p>If you persist, therefore, in your charitable purposes towards me, and the opportunity be still <supplied>[fav]</supplied>ourable, I shall be very glad to hear from you a<supplied>[gain]</supplied> on that subject, and very prompt to take wh<supplied>[at]</supplied>ever measure I can for putting the affair in <supplied>[prac]</supplied>tical motion.</p>
<p>There is still, awaiting from tomorrow, a festival of Country visiting before me; but after the last days of this month I expect to be constantly here and in the meantime Letters sent to this A<supplied>[d]</supplied>dress will generally reach me in a day.</p>
<closer><salute>Believe me / Yours much obliged</salute></closer>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I do not think there will be the slightest chance of finding your Cardplate in the present distracted conditions of these premises, and of all that inhabit them; therefore indeed, not to wreck the peace farther, I say nothing about it at all! All kinds of painters, gasfitters, glaziers, just in the agony of departure (for it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> all to be clear in 3 days or 4), are storming about this house, four or five ladders on the staircase, which is covered with dusty litter, and requires you to mind your skirts well, and have a supply of <hi rend="italic">turpentine</hi> over and above. Add to which we ourselves are just packing up, off for the Grange for a week or ten days, till the thing do end. A journey, which, like all farther journeys, I have struggled to omit; but it is in fact the reasonablest course, and so we go at twelve today.&#x2014; Poor Jane is worn to a thread, thinner in fact than I ever saw her, poor soul; and I myself am nearly brokenhearted, nearly <hi rend="italic">dead;</hi> asking of the Fates one blessing, a place to lie down in, and be let alone there, which hitherto cannot anywhere be granted me, but will soon here, if it now please the Powers.&#x2014;I brought you a Book from Berlin, a <hi rend="italic">Vocabulario Dantesco</hi> by some learned man of Halle; a Gift from poor Abeken,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bernard Rudolf Abeken (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), educationist, classical and literary scholar, who trans. Dante&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi>, wrote on Goethe, and was tutor to Schiller&#x2019;s sons. He was at the dinner with Magnus and Cornelius, <date when="1852-10-05">5 Oct.</date>; Neuberg speaks of him as a &#x201C;Privy Councillor &#x2026; of the Foreign Ministry&#x201C; (Sadler 289). TC later often asked him for details about Frederick.</note> whom you remember at Rome as <foreign><hi rend="italic">Blitzableiter</hi></foreign> [lightning rod, i.e., troubleshooter], who is now an Official man at Berlin, and was unweariedly kind to me while there. I meant to have sent the Book, first yesterday, and still more indisputably this morning: but I perceive you cannot do the least good with it in your present interesting posture, and so it shall lie here, till you order ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it at my return.</p>
<p>We send you deepest good wishes, and innumerable unspoken thoughts, solemn, serious, hopeful and ever affectionate, on your great affair,&#x2014;which may God prosper, in every sense! Certainly in your new life are many elements of good, which all parts of the old one have wanted; so, as beseems serious mortals, we will pray and augur well.&#x2014; Kindest regards to the Lady who is to be my Sister you must not forget to offer from me. I have nothing more today; but hope soon to hear again, and write again. <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear good Mother,</salute>
<p>I hoped to have written you more deliberately, if not yesterday&#x2014;which proved impossible, at least today: but it appears we must still have a little patience; for never was there less time or deliberation than even now! The work-people, painters &#x26;c &#x26;c, are just in the struggles of finishing; they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to go bodily, and we hope for ever, on Wednesday next: but as yet all is <hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi> here, and except my own bedroom (where I now write) there is not a <hi rend="italic">rid</hi> [clear] corner from top to bottom of the house. Besides which, we ourselves are just packing up to go to The Grange for a week, and wait there till this end; till at least there is a staircase free where one can travel with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> painting one&#x2019;s skirts. Alas, The Grange is not the place where I wanted to rest; and I have struggled hard enough not to go there or <hi rend="italic">anywhere</hi> at present: but it is evidently the reasonable thing to do; a thing Jane has engaged for, and will not (for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> share) draw back from; so I submit, what can I do!&#x2014; This house will evidently be very nice, and much improved, when once it is set in order again (this day week, it will at least be <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> and <hi rend="italic">clean</hi>): but the doing of it has cost an immensity of <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash!</hi></foreign> Poor Jane is quite worn out with fretting and struggling, and breathing paint so long: I do not think I ever saw her thinner these seven years: but if Heaven please, it shall all be over now before long; and poor souls will get settled to their <hi rend="italic">work</hi> again, if they can manage to do any.&#x2014; &#x2014; I hear from John today a most short word, and write him the like, on his great enterprise: poor good soul, I hope and believe, and at least pray with my whole heart, it may be a most important improvement for him. My brave old Mother, he says, takes it bravely, calmly, as she has done all things; which is what I expected, but yet is comfortable to hear.&#x2014;I will write again from The Grange: <closer><salute>Kindest regards to Jamie &#x26; Isabella. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother, and blessings with you all.&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Here certainly I am; and here your kind letter has reached me;&#x2014;at least the first letter has, which was the important one, for the promised <hi rend="italic">second</hi> containing Jenny&#x2019;s as Enclosure has never yet come to hand. As I know Jenny&#x2019;s news by you and by some Scotsbrig channels, it is no matter about this latter omission.</p>
<p>I had a dreadful time of it in Germany, with incessant locomotion and want of sleep; I saw a great many interesting things, of course; but in this utterly broken humour, I could give myself right account of none, and was forced, as it were, to stuff all into my bag for future study.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not long after, TC noted in his Journal, &#x201C;all this, which is <hi rend="italic">etched</hi> into me painfully as with burning acids, I once thought of writing down in detail, but have not done, probably shall not do,&#x2014;certainly not here. It was a journey done as in some Shirt of Nessus, misery and dyspeptic degradation, inflammation and insomnia tracking every step of me: not till all these vile fire-showers, fallen into viler ashes now, have once been winnowed quite away, shall I see what &#x2018;additions to my spiritual picture-gallery,&#x2019; or other conquests from the business, I have actually brought back with me.&#x201C;</note> Neither, alas, when I got home, on Wednesday (8 days ago),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1852-10-13">13 Oct.</date></note> was there any rest; the house still full of painters, at least <hi rend="italic">varnishers</hi>, of returning Carpenters, of litter, ruin and confusion;&#x2014;and as for poor Jane she had nearly worked herself to death with all the hubbub of these operations, and could absolutely do no more towards getting all done in time. It had ultimately beaten her; and not till 4 days more was there an absolute certainty that the last painter would actually take his leave Alas, alas! However, there was a pressing invitation for us both to come <pb id="pg-27-336" n="27:336"/>hither; and hither, after some struggling, we have actually come since friday last, and are engaged to stay till &#x201C;the House at Chelsea is thoroughly <hi rend="italic">washed</hi>, and the smell of the varnish somewhat abated,&#x201C;&#x2014;which means, I conjecture, some day early next week, or rather perhaps not &#x201C;early&#x201C; at all, for indeed it is not settled yet, and we must wait what is appointed and indicated by the proprieties of the thing. Alas, I am not &#x201C;happy&#x201C; here, tho&#x2019; lodged, waited on, nourished, and curried, with the perfection of human art: one thing I want and cannot get: profound <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> and rest;&#x2014;no real rest is appointed for me here; I need not look for the like of that here! I gallop daily thro&#x2019; the country on swift horses; take what care I can of the fatally <hi rend="italic">late</hi> dinner;&#x2014;smoke tobacco, sauntering amid these woods &#x26; bushes; and endeavour to keep a &#x201C;calm <foreign>sough</foreign><supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied> and wait patiently till my own shop open for me again.</p>
<p>Jack is actually to be married; and has a fair prospect, I think, of being comfortable as a wealthy father-of-a family.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>It is now high time I should write you some brief word to announce my arrival at least, and fulfil the trust<supplied>[?]</supplied> and the express engagement I lay under in that respect. I have been home in safety a week and a day; and have more than once remonstrated with myself in the matter. Let me seize the moment, therefore; and save at least so much from a day which (like its fellows here) is too apt to be wasted otherwise.</p>
<p>I got along beautifully thro&#x2019; Verviers and the Walloon Country<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Verviers is a small city in E Belgium; Wallonia is the French-speaking part.</note> under the escort of your two friends; and met with nothing, all the way to Malines,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Also known as Mechelen, a city in N Belgium, nr. Antwerp.</note> to put me in the least into difficulty or inconvenience: at Malines I found an indifferent inn, &#x201C;bad butter,&#x201C; and ditto bedroom, in which latter, however, I <pb id="pg-27-337" n="27:337"/>managed to sleep, in successive pieces, a great many hours; a fact worth all other qualities in a room to me. Brussels and Antwerp seemed unadvisable after my late hour of breakfast; I sauntered the morning away in dull Malines, walking into the country &#x26;c, till 2 o&#x2019;clock, and then, or rather an hour after, got into my Bruges<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NW Belgium.</note> train; dined at Bruges (rather miserably); tried to walk about the streets a little by lamplight, but couldn&#x2019;t for &#x201C;commissionaires&#x201C; at every corner offering their services to me;&#x2014;finally got to Ostend;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Belgian seaport.</note> got fairly on board the English Steamer; and on this, after a sufficiently dreary night, was safely floated to the Customhouse Stairs, and turned out for my two hours ordeal there. In all my journey I had met with nothing so detestable as said ordeal in such circumstances was: however, it too ended; boats and a Chelsea Steamer were at hand; and in fine, between one and two o&#x2019;clock, I got across my own threshold again; and thanked God that at least those travellings were over.&#x2014; Jane seemed well; better than I have since found her to be: but unhappily the poor House, was still unclean with painters, upholsterers and their litter; so that the &#x201C;repose&#x201C; I had longed for was not to be found there either; nor till &#x201C;Wednesday next&#x201C; (that is <hi rend="italic">yesterday</hi> now) was the perfect final clearance to be looked for. After some kicking against the pricks<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Acts 9:5.</note> I agreed in the course of thursday that our invitation to The Grange was really in these circumstances a thing to thank the Heavens for;&#x2014;a thing to be accepted, and put into practical action without delay. Here accordingly we have been ever since Friday last; in one of the loveliest green scenes and stateliest spacious Houses in England; with right pleasant people too in part;&#x2014;alas, with all things, only with less possibility still of any solid <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> than could be wished! I must take what is arranged. The unclean creatures, I strive to assure myself, are now fairly gone from Cheyne Row; and the house, in these very hours, must (I flatter myself) be getting washed from top to bottom. Early next week, we may hope to be there; and, under good auspices, to cast anchor and refuse all farther excitation or locomotion for a very great while indeed! This is the authentic history of me since I left you. My poor Wife has had a really miserable time of it with these house-operations, in my absence; I have not for seven years seen her look so worn and thin: however, in spite of a whiff of cold she has had since we came hither, I already see the good effects of free air, and the absence of housepainters, upon her; and expect she will rapidly recover herself, were we once home and at rest: and surely never again in this world shall any considerable &#x201C;house-repair&#x201C; be undertaken by her or me again, unless we lose our wits in the interim!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-338" n="27:338"/>Of London I send nothing but one glimpse in a walk up Piccadilly; whither I went, about despatching the Spanish Book to Magnus, as one of my very first jobs. The street was, as usual, in many places, getting new-paved; the day was dark, a still canopy of <date when="0000-10-00">October</date> haze and smoke overshadowing all things: what a contrast to Berlin, to Dresden, to Lobositz! I have yet taken no new hold of London; and only find it sooty as ever.</p>
<p>Here in the country we lead the usual strenuously-idle life, and hear of things only at a pleasant distance, and feel bound to treat them (in the English fashion) with contempt. Alas, I grudge the bright days of <hi rend="italic">time</hi> one loses; for there is absolutely no saving of them here! We have agreeable enough people; notabilities, of a friendly nature, Thackeray &#x26;c, among them: the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> American Minister, one Ingersol a Philadelphian,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Reed Ingersoll (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>), lawyer and former congressman from Pennsylvania; served briefly as minister to Gt. Britain. His niece is unidentified.</note> with his pretty Niece have just left us;&#x2014;a strange exotic phenomenon, tho&#x2019; intrinsically not to be objected to: a certain lady defined him as dreadfully incapable of silence or rest, &#x201C;whirling about as if his pockets were full of hot cinders.&#x201C; The truth is, he is yet all in a flurry with the amazing novelty of the thing (his own missive is said to be a sudden American <hi rend="italic">job</hi>); he will certainly recover himself, being a man of good logical sense, by the aid of a little time. Parliament is to meet in a fortnight from this day; a fact important to people who have Townhouse and Countryhouse, and may be in straits as to the time of shifting; to the world at large it is not nearly so momentous. But all the world here is really in great excitement with a rumour which has just got out, that Lord Derby means to <hi rend="italic">grant</hi> Convocation its desire, and actually let it sit for the arranging of matters connected with the Church!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Convocation dating from medieval times was an assembly of clergy in two houses, constituted by statute to act or advise on church affairs. Since the early eighteenth century its power had greatly diminished; but, in <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>, chiefly roused by the bishops of Oxford and Exeter, Convocation petitioned Parliament for permission to meet. For the moment the matter was unsettled, but by the time it met again, it was to resume action as a consultative body.</note> This is a far more stirring outlook than the assembling of a mere Commonplace Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and a ministry without plan or footing; and I rather conjecture to myself the news may be really true. All men of judgement regard it as the first stroke of the axe, first stroke of 10,000 axes, crowbars and disruptive implements, upon our poor old rotten fabric of a Church: but that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be no reason with Lord Derby, who tho&#x2019; said to be a friend of the Church, is probably without eye for such perils, and has a headlong blindfold way very much in the style of this strange step. It quite resembles his emancipation of the Blacks,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As colonial sec., Lord Stanley (as he was then) had carried the act for abolition of slavery, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>.</note> and some other measures we owe <pb id="pg-27-339" n="27:339"/>to him. Not to say that he already sees himself in a minority, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> strength either in the country or the Parl<hi rend="italic">t;</hi>&#x2014;and, in fact, has no other <hi rend="italic">dashing</hi> measure that he could accomplish, either for good or evil, except even this. We shall see! It is asserted (in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> first, three days ago); denied, then reasserted: except from a very great distance, and as a <hi rend="italic">spectacle</hi> that will make the winter exciting, it does not affect my wishes or regrets at all but, as above said, I rather do guess it to be a true rumour,&#x2014;and expect the incipient destruction of Babel in consequence. Heaven&#x2019;s will be done!</p>
<p>Lord Ashburton had already decided on getting a copy of that Portrait of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> by Graff, of which you heard so much from me in Berlin. I have accordingly written to Magnus formally that he is to set his man upon it; this little work I shall regard as a small conquest for England if we once had it. Lady Ash<hi rend="italic">bn</hi> also wishes for a stock of German Historical or rather Biographical <hi rend="italic">Prints</hi>,&#x2014;Portraits namely of distinguished men (<hi rend="italic">truly</hi> distinguished) of the 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi> and earlier centuries. Thiers employed to collect for her Ladyship in France: but as to Germany? I know no course, except perhaps trying Magnus again;&#x2014;and that, as he is about going away into foreign parts, seems uncertain.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Neuberg; my paper and time are both done; and in fact I have no composure here, were all else in my favour, for writing. I look back on our journey as a strange dream, which nevertheless was a fact. When I contemplate your unwearied <hi rend="italic">patience</hi>, helpfulness, adroitness and friendly imperturbability, I declare I am lost in reflexions and emotions, <hi rend="italic">remorse</hi> by no means wanting among them!&#x2014; Yours ever truly</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>Jane sends her kind regards to Miss Neuberg and you; and in the former quarter I beg also for continued forgivenness<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> and remembrances. Honnef, Rolandseck, and the two Cocks&#x2014;ah me!</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>The day we came off hither I wrote you a hurried little Note, promising that I would write again. There is &#x201C;time&#x201C; enough here, one would think, for doing any amount of work in the writing way! In fact there is no place I ever saw that could surpass this in <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi>, utter absence of attempted or accomplished <hi rend="italic">labour.</hi> Yet somehow it happens one can here least of all find <hi rend="italic">time</hi> for anything; and it requires both exertion and invention to catch any hour at which you can be free and certain to get so much as a letter written. At one time you are to ride, to walk, to go and see this thing or that; at another there is no fire in your room, and the weather too cold to dispense with that, &#x26;c &#x26;c: in short one&#x2019;s day is wasted away in doing laboriously altogether <hi rend="italic">nothing;</hi> which is a result by no means comfortable, to one individual of us, to reflect upon, at present!</p>
<p>In other respects, all goes tolerably well here. Jane had a threatening whiff of cold, for two days; but it went away again, and she is now fully as well as common with her,&#x2014;gone out to walk at this moment (Saturday, 11 o&#x2019;clock, just after breakfast), the morning being fine, and two wet days before having prevented any exercise of that sort, at least to people with long tails and thin shoes. I myself missed <hi rend="italic">riding</hi>; but took precautions against showers, and by no means missed a long stiff walk. Our weather in general is sunny and very pleasant, quite <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> this morning, tho&#x2019; the trees are all red, and many leaves are falling when the wind blows. There is an immense assemblage of rooks (honest <hi rend="italic">crows</hi>) around the mansion here; their hoarse melody is often the first thing I hear in the morning; and at all times it invites me to pensive reflexions, and remembrances of poor old Ecclefechan and Hoddam woods where I first heard such sounds in days that are now a very great way behind me. The flight of the &#x201C;craws,&#x201C; far up in the sky, over Ecclefechan village, on <pb id="pg-27-341" n="27:341"/>summer evenings, towards their home in Woodcockair,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A wooded hill, ca. 2 mi. WSW of Ecclefechan.</note> is one of the pleasant things I recollect out of early childhood, and along with it so many persons whom I shall not see again in this world! Time, Eternity&#x2014;God make us <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> to these great facts, which lie in the life of every man!&#x2014;</p>
<p>There is nothing to be sent you <hi rend="italic">hence</hi>, dear Mother, in the shape of news; little happens here that is of moment, and nothing that could be interesting so far away as Annandale. We are a shifting, not very numerous party in the house; &#x201C;agreeable,&#x201C; that is the first law; but not otherwise doing or saying important things. The new American Ambassador (a Lawyer from Philadelphia) was here the other day; he staid two nights; had his pretty Niece and another pair of Americans with him: he looked <hi rend="italic">like Ker the Clockmaker</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> <hi rend="italic">grown oldish;</hi> really a most <hi rend="italic">mechanic</hi>-looking, tho&#x2019; rather clever man, and he bustled about, as Jane said, &#x201C;like a man with his pockets full of hot cinders&#x201C;:&#x2014;we took kind leave of him; but did not shed many tears when he went. Thackeray is coming, for whom I care nothing tho&#x2019; he is a clever and friendly man; he comes today with a nobleman and a Portrait-Painter;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Laurence; see next letter.</note> comes, but is soon to go:&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">di&#x2019; tha naither ill na&#x2019; guid!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>From Chelsea we hear only that the Painter is still <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, tho&#x2019; now (thank Heaven) just about departing. The last news is that he is to have done this very evening (Saturday): Jane&#x2019;s prediction to me was that he would have ended on <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi> last; but there he still is, and one knows not with certainty whether he will quite keep this second term either. One way or other he <hi rend="italic">must</hi> now, in not many hours, take himself away! It appears, however, we are to stay here a full week longer than was expected: so they have settled it with Jane in these circumstances. She proposes going home by herself next Thursday or so; wanting a day or two of sorting at the house before I come: I am to follow on the Monday after (if I recollect?), and hope <hi rend="italic">then</hi> at last to get myself fairly flung down to some kind of rest, if not <hi rend="italic">set</hi> down to some kind of work, once more! Ah me, Ah me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had a Note from John, and wrote him an answer the very morning I wrote last to Scotsbrig: he was then to be in the neighbourhood of Liverpool, and I have heard nothing from him since. Poor Jack, I sincerely wish him from the bottom of my heart all prosperity in this adventure&#x2014;which of us does not?&#x2014; Nor is there any reason to think it other than very fortunate for him: nevertheless, in one&#x2019;s serious mood, all changes are sad, and this change too is sad rather than joyful to one! I seriously think, however, he will be greatly better off for being fixed in the world, especially on those advantageous and highly opulent terms. He is likely also to be more in my neighbourhood than he <pb id="pg-27-342" n="27:342"/>would otherwise have been; which of course is another gain to me.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jean wrote since I came hither; all well with her: she also enclosed Jenny&#x2019;s Letter from Canada;&#x2014;poor little Jenny, I think it possible her <hi rend="italic">lodging</hi> by the side of that water may not be very wholesome; else why so many <hi rend="italic">agues?</hi> She seems to make light of them; and indeed I conjecture they may partly be the price a weak newcomer has to pay on entrance, till once <hi rend="italic">seasoned</hi> to the place: however, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> rather like to hear they had <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to a new place to live in, and that the poor little soul were done with these fits of liver.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I cannot know how you are, tho&#x2019; I ask the question daily many times,&#x2014;unless Isabella will be helpful enough to write! Ask her to do so for me; I enclose a cover, within which she can soon put a little word for me, explaining what you all are about, what Jamie is doing; how <hi rend="italic">you</hi> and they all are. <closer><salute>Farewell, dear Mother, for this day; I send my heart&#x2019;s blessing to you all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Hunt,</salute>
<p>I can make nothing, or almost nothing, of Lord Hervey&#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">duchtich</hi></foreign>. In the first place, it is certain, there is no such word in German; nor can his commentator ever have &#x201C;consulted&#x201C; any &#x201C;German friend&#x201C; on the subject, but <pb id="pg-27-344" n="27:344"/>must have simply inserted his own guess upon pure chance.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hervey (<date when="1696-00-00">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1743-00-00">1743</date>), Baron Hervey of Ickworth, &#x201C;Sporus&#x201C; in Pope&#x2019;s &#x201C;Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot.&#x201C; Hunt had written to TC, <date when="1852-10-23">23 Oct.</date>, asking the meaning of &#x201C;<foreign>duchtich</foreign>,&#x201C; used in Hervey&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of George II</hi>, ed. J. W. Carter (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), 2:148 and 161. Croker&#x2019;s note, 2:148, referred to &#x201C;My German friends&#x201C; not agreeing on meaning, but suggested &#x201C;sly.&#x201C; Hunt wrote again, <date when="1852-10-26">26 Oct.</date>, quoting the contexts. The word does not exist in that spelling in High German, but in Middle Low German and Dutch means &#x201C;capable, able.&#x201C;</note> So much is clear enough to me: but what word his Lordship did intend, is a question difficult to answer; and without good study of the context the answer cannot well be so much as conjectured.</p>
<p>Drawing a bow at a venture, I have a considerable notion he may have meant the adjective <foreign><hi rend="italic">t&#xfc;chtig</hi></foreign> (which is very similar in pronunciation, especially between a Hanoverian and an Englishman, the <hi rend="italic">g</hi> too being guttural, and the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> easily confounded with <hi rend="italic">d</hi>): <foreign><hi rend="italic">T&#xfc;chtig</hi></foreign> signifies &#x201C;effective,&#x201C; &#x201C;solidly expert&#x201C;; it is in fact fundamentally the same word as our <hi rend="italic">doughty</hi> (from the Scotch verb <hi rend="italic">dow</hi>, &#x201C;to be able&#x201C;; German <foreign><hi rend="italic">taugen</hi></foreign>); but it is not so high a word as <hi rend="italic">doughty</hi>, nor at all exclusively applied to martial work, but it is used as a term of familiar but deliberate praise to a man of worth, who is thoroughly master of what he pretends to, in regard to work or action of any kind. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ein t&#xfc;chtiger mann</hi></foreign>=a genuine, a sufficient man. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tugend</hi></foreign> (the substantive of the word) signifies <hi rend="small-caps">Virtue</hi> in German; but perhaps the meaning of <foreign><hi rend="italic">t&#xfc;chtig</hi></foreign> to Lord Hervey might be pretty much equivalent to &#x201C;clever,&#x201C;&#x2014;if he used <foreign><hi rend="italic">t&#xfc;chtig</hi></foreign>, if he intended <hi rend="italic">it</hi> when he wrote <foreign><hi rend="italic">duchtich</hi></foreign>.</p>
<p>If this make sense of the passage for you, I think you may stand by this; such is the likelihood of the mistake in his case.</p>
<p>But I am coming home in about a week; and if the point is still obscure, and you will then send me a copy of the passage at large, or instruct me how to find it in the London Library, I will deliberately study it, and do my best to rede the riddle for myself and you. Tuesday next, and after that <foreign><hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi></foreign> [freely].</p>
<p><closer><salute>Nobody was ever more in haste than I for the present; so <foreign>adieu</foreign>, dear Hunt; and believe me ever (without doubt or misgiving)</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Yours with sincere regard</salute></closer>

<salute>Dear Hunt,</salute>
<p>There is no good sense, I fear, to be made out of &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">duchtich</hi></foreign>&#x201C; on any hypothesis: <foreign><hi rend="italic">t&#xfc;chtig</hi></foreign> does not answer well in the passages you give; and I can <pb id="pg-27-345" n="27:345"/>think of only one other German word which plausibly resembles <foreign><hi rend="italic">duchtich;</hi></foreign>&#x2014;this perhaps answers a little better, but this also is by no means conclusively convincing. The word &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">z&#xfc;chtig</hi></foreign>&#x201C; (pronounce <hi rend="italic">tz</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dz</hi>) signifies <hi rend="italic">well-bred, polite, discreet</hi>, also <hi rend="italic">chaotic, modest</hi>, and on the whole <foreign><hi rend="italic">comme il faut</hi></foreign> [as it should be]; this, perhaps once <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>pronounced &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">duchtich</hi></foreign>&#x201C; by Hervey, <hi rend="italic">may</hi> in &#x201C;Coterie speech&#x201C; have become a common word in that circle:&#x2014;at all events, <foreign><hi rend="italic">duchtich is</hi></foreign> clearly a <hi rend="italic">coterie</hi>-word; and need not be sought after in dictionaries; nay who knows but the English Editor<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Croker.</note> himself may have misread it (<foreign><hi rend="italic">deutlich</hi></foreign>, &#x201C;evident,&#x201C; &#x201C;clear,&#x201C; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very like it in writing); not to say that Hervey&#x2019;s own Ms. does not usually spell German with propriety,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">teufflish</hi></foreign>, for example, should be <foreign><hi rend="italic">teuflisch</hi></foreign> [fiendish] &#x26;c. In short, I consider it impossible to guess what the word was, from such data as we have; and advise you not to chase it farther than into the hiding-places already indicated. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Sly</hi>&#x201C; I do not believe it to have meant; nor on the whole will &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">t&#xfc;chtig</hi></foreign>&#x201C; do; &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">z&#xfc;chtig</hi></foreign>&#x201C; I give you as my likeliest guess: but with certainty (unless by Pharoah&#x2019;s Soothsayers, or by the victor over them) there can nothing be given.</p>
<p>N.b. &#x201C;Coterie-speech&#x201C; is a German phrase; but I have no doubt you understand it well, and can give good account of it in an English Note. And that, I believe, will fairly help you thro&#x2019; the difficulty.</p>
<p>Thanks for the Note on Alresford;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Which Hunt quotes from &#x201C;an old Gazetteer&#x201C;: &#x201C;&#x2018;On May day, <date when="1710-05-00">1710</date>, this town was burnt down by a fire which spared neither the Market House nor Church. &#x2026; It has been since burnt down, but is handsomely rebuilt. Part of a Roman highway, that goes from this place to Alton, serves for the head to a great pond, or rather a little lake near this town, on which are abundance of swans.&#x2019;&#x201C; Hunt thanked TC for his note, <date when="1852-10-30">30 Oct.</date></note> which is yet true enough to Nature in its geographical part, tho&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">historical</hi> (of the two burnings) has vanished from all memories that I consult. The big pond, with Swans, and the bit of Roman Road &#x201C;to Alton&#x201C; (properly from Winchester to London) are all still there; and a clean merry-looking market village as if no fire or disaster had ever been.</p>

<salute>Dear Isabella,</salute>
<p>I got your Letter, with much thankfulness; and was very glad indeed to hear that my Mother and the rest of you were so well.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-27-346" n="27:346"/>Jane went away from this place yesterday, in clearly better case than she had come, tho&#x2019; still very weakly; she had got authentic news that the Painters &#x26;c were now fairly all gone about their business (on Thursday last, I think); whereupon she set off on Friday (which at any rate was her preappointed day); but refused to take me with her for <hi rend="italic">two days to come</hi> till she had got the house sorted a little. I accordingly am here till monday; a most solitary, silent and rather dull and melancholy man. For the people are absolutely all away, Jane was the <hi rend="italic">last;</hi> and except the Lord and Lady of the place, who are busy with many things of their own, and only appear at meal-time, there is absolutely no soul here but myself, and this big house in the public parts of it, is silent as a Convent. However I have Books, I have tobacco, also a good ride daily; and am at no loss to pass my time till Monday.</p>
<p>The Doctor will have returned before this arrive. Tell him the earliest Note he can write will find me at Chelsea now. I have still the German Book which I send or keep as he requires when I get home. I long also to know when the grand day for him is to be.</p>
<p>One thing I must not forget: the oatmeal&#x2014;Jane, when I inquired about it, could give no precise answer; but I think about 3 or 4 stone,&#x2014;say 4 stone,&#x2014;will be enough, with our present ways of supping. The butter and it will, of course, be welcome, whenever they come.</p>
<p>I am glad for Jamie&#x2019;s sake to hear of such prices for cattle: the whole country is prospering exceedingly in trade (owing to the Californian <hi rend="italic">gold</hi>, say some); but it requires no <hi rend="italic">warlock</hi> to prophesy that that will not be lasting.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Isabella. The rooks are becoming audible from the distant woods; and my daylight and paper are both at an end.

It appears you had not, at the date of writing, received the long and confused account that had been sent you:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the same day, <date when="1852-11-05">5 Nov.</date>, Neuberg was writing TC from Bonn: &#x201C;I just began to feel somewhat anxious about your silence, when your letter from <hi rend="italic">the Grange</hi> [<date when="1852-10-21">21 Oct.</date>] arrived and put all right.&#x201C;</note> but I hope it did at last arrive nevertheless; and satisfy you about one point, that I was not entirely ungrateful for all the friendly pains you had taken with me, and the more than friendly patience you had many times shewn in the course of that unforgettable journey of ours! On other points I was, and still alas am, little able to give you satisfaction. At my return, broken down to utter wreck with long road-woes and the like, I found this poor establishment still full of painters and miscellaneous uncleannesses; quite incapable of being lived in; my poor wife in despair at not having shelter to offer me: in brief, we went, as you know, to The Grange;&#x2014;and there also, among gay persons of quality, with &#x201C;dinner at 8, Sir,&#x201C; I made but little progress in the great problem of finding &#x201C;rest.&#x201C; Alas, alas!&#x2014; We got home again only a few days ago: the house is now habitable; but miscellaneous remnants of upholstering, gardening, gas-fitting, and other furnishing out of the details still painfully goes on, and must go on; all my possessions and arrangements are thrown heels over head, and from the position of my bath and towels to that of my books and papers all is still change and readjustment,&#x2014;to me a state of matters eminently unpropitious always! In fact, we must have patience yet a while; keep in view the marked improvement as to house-accommodation there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> finally sure to be; and, for the rest, hope we shall never have another change of house to make till we get done with earthly houses! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu, Eheu!</hi></foreign>&#x2014; On the whole, I never in my life felt so utterly <hi rend="italic">demoralised</hi> (in the Napoleon sense) as in these two days since I actually got home again, and sat down face to face with the chaotic heap of <hi rend="italic">facts</hi> which are around me and within me, and which must be conquered or they will abolish me. The changed house is but a topstone to innumerable other far subtler and more terrible mountains of disorder. Pray for me; I really require the goodwishes of friendly souls,&#x2014;and it is difficult, in these abstruse courses, to get much help in that way, too. But, in fine, I at least ought to <hi rend="italic">hold my peace;</hi> that is the beginning of all progress for a human worker; and so for the present at least, I will say no more on that hand.</p>
<p>Last night there arrived, safe and sound, &#x201C;by the Elbe&#x201C; (Steamer?) from <pb id="pg-27-348" n="27:348"/>Hamburg a considerable square Box, firmly nailed and to appearance full of Books: these I understand well to be the fruit of our or rather your stern labours in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Antiquar-Buchhandlungen</hi></foreign> [antiquarian bookshops] of the German cities: there they stand, the Carrier demanding nothing for them except a gratuity of two-pence to drink, and the Paper he left us bearing also expressly &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Nil</hi></foreign>&#x201C; for the present: there they as yet stand; for till I get shelves (which will not be even in a temporary form till this afternoon, and in a permanent form who knows when?), I have not the heart to open the poor Box, or pour its contents into the general inundation which marks these premises in respect of books. I have no doubt it is all right; surely it has been speedy and punctual, to say nothing of probable cheapness, in comparison with Williams &#x26; Norgate&#x2019;s method: and so, once more, I have to say to you <foreign><hi rend="italic">Euge</hi></foreign> [Well done]! and to feel, if I do not express, the most emphatic thanks. What can be the meaning of one man&#x2019;s &#x201C;helping&#x201C; another, if you do not loyally try to help me, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be difficult to say!&#x2014; &#x2014; For the rest, I have not at present the least notion of ever writing upon <hi rend="italic">Friedrich;</hi> so far as the eye of imagination can reach I do not even see the possibility of such a thing. But here are the materials; a long wish, at any rate, is gratified; and if at any time such a purpose do take me, I can set about it with what strength is left. Something I must do! But some thing far more out of the inmost heart w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the desirable thing to do. Here also I have need of your prayers;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote TC, <date when="1852-11-08">8 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I can understand very well, too, the repugnance and uneasiness, the attractive-repulsive interest that is connected in your mind with the subject of <hi rend="italic">Frederic.</hi> It is like being in love with a woman whom one cannot <hi rend="italic">esteem</hi> to the degree desirable under such circumstances.&#x2014; He is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a man after your own heart; and you have hitherto dealt mainly with such only, drawing ever new inspiration from communing with them and looking at them.&#x201C;</note> nay here chiefly, or here alone. Let us hope, let us hope; above all things, let us be <hi rend="italic">silent.</hi></p>
<p>Returning from The Grange, I found, among other masses of rubbish, four N<hi rend="italic">os</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">Methodist Magazine</hi>, containing at distant intervals thro&#x2019; six months, a criticism of me;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >[Thomas McNicoll], &#x201C;The Writings of Thomas Carlyle,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Wesleyan Methodist Magazine</hi> 75 (<date when="1852-05-00">May</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-10-00">Oct. 1852</date>): 489&#x2013;93, 696&#x2013;702, 802&#x2013;5, 999&#x2013;1008. These reviews of his works impressed TC by their earnestness and consistency. He mentions them in TC to JCA, <date when="1852-11-08">8 Nov.</date>, as raising &#x201C;a really serious tho<hi rend="italic">t.</hi>&#x201C; McNicoll saw TC as a misleading though &#x201C;subtle and consummate genius&#x201C; (491). He argued against TC&#x2019;s deism, his unintelligibility, and the falsity of his worship of force seen in &#x201C;the ravings of <hi rend="italic">Hero-Worship</hi>&#x201C; (805), denying the conclusion of the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi> that he was &#x201C;a great thinker&#x201C; (<date when="1006-00-00">1006</date>).</note> which I glanced over, and found very strange. I stand before that poor Methodist, it clearly appears, as one of the most portentous black immeasureable monsters, threatening (unless I be a humbug and fool, of which he has a wavering timid hope) to eat up the solar system and submerge mankind! The &#x201C;misunderstandings&#x201C; of men by one another sometimes <pb id="pg-27-349" n="27:349"/>rise to the enormous. All this has given me many tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> for these two days.</p>
<p>Thackeray is gone to America to lecture: a Novel of his came out just on his departure,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Liverpool, <date when="1852-10-30">30 Oct.</date> <hi rend="italic">The History of Henry Esmond Esq., A Colonel in the Service of Her Majesty Q. Anne, Written by Himself</hi>, 3 vols., was pbd. in the week of <date when="1852-10-24">24 Oct.</date> In <date when="1852-11-00">Nov.</date> (though see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521229-JWC-KS-01">JWC to KS, [<date when="1852-12-29">29 Dec.</date>?]</ref>) JWC wrote a short story in a notebook that TC entitled &#x201C;Child Love&#x201C; and that JWC herself entitled &#x201C;The Simple Story of my own First-Love.&#x201C; It opens with: &#x201C;What the &#x2018;greatest Philosopher of our day&#x2019; execrates loudest in Thackeray&#x2019;s new Novel&#x2014;finds indeed &#x2018;altogether false and damnable in it&#x2019;&#x2014;is that love is represented as spreading itself over our whole existence, and constituting one of the grand interests of it; whereas love&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">thing people call love</hi>&#x2014;is confined to a very few years of man&#x2019;s life; to, in fact, a quite insignificant fraction of it, and even then is but one thing to be attended to among many infinitely more important things. Indeed, so far as he (Mr. C.) has seen into it, the whole concern of love is such a beggarly futility, that in an heroic age of the world nobody would be at the pains to think of it, much less to open his mouth upon it&#x201C; (A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:47, which also prints the story [2:48&#x2013;57]; Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 1:285 also gives the opening remarks).</note> and threatens to prove very tiresome and therefore justly &#x201C;unsuccessful&#x201C;: he was in person at The Grange for two or three days, but did not captivate us very much; a spectacle rather that made me infinitely <hi rend="italic">sad. <foreign>Aus dem wird&#x2014;was</foreign></hi> [What will become of him]?</p>
<p>My Brother John was married on Tuesday last at Moffat in Scotland<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1852-11-02">2 Nov.</date> to Phoebe Elizabeth Hough Watt, only child of the late John Fowler of Hutton Hall, Staffordshire; <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1852-11-10">10 Nov.</date></note> and is now upon his marriage-jaunt I know not precisely where! The Lady is a Widow of 40, &#x201C;handsome if not beautiful,&#x201C; with 4 children and &#xa3;4,000 a-year (at her own disposal), whom he has known since old Roman times, and always more and more esteemed for her many good qualities and kindliness of nature. And so it is winded up; and Jack is suddenly a <foreign>Paterfamilias</foreign> and rich man in his generation: poor Brother, may it prosper well with him! He is a good soul, after all; and has borne much indifferent fortune in the cheerfullest spirit.&#x2014; Alas, men are waiting for me this half hour! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Neuberg</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sister Jean,</salute>
<p>In very great haste, and amid manifold disturbance outward and inward, as is too much usual of late, I write you a line, to say at least that I am <hi rend="italic">here</hi> again; that there is nothing very <hi rend="italic">special</hi> the matter with me or with any here; and <pb id="pg-27-350" n="27:350"/>that I am still mindful of you, and whether in low spirits or in high (if <hi rend="italic">that</hi> were ever the description of my style of &#x201C;spirits&#x201C;) I do not forget old friends and affectionate kindred. Ah no; if &#x201C;remembrance&#x201C; could do any good to them or myself, certainly I &#x201C;remember&#x201C; well enough!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s Journal confirms that his travels, arrival home, visit to and return from the Grange, despair at facing <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, and possibly other matters profoundly depressed him: &#x201C;In the wet damp evening of a pouring day I once more got home again for a continuance. Since then, here are we, <hi rend="italic">fronting</hi> our destiny, at least; which I own is sufficiently Medusa-like to these sick solitary eyes. &#x2026; Meantime say no more for this day.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>It was not till Tuesday evening last that I got fairly up hither, and back, for good, to my old establishment again. Jane had set off on the friday before, to get things a little ready; but insisted on my staying two days longer.&#x2014; The workmen, painters included, are all out of the house, for this season,&#x2014;paperhanging &#x26;c and a final coat of paint, for this chief room, stands over till summer; and the rest of the house is all complete, varnished and shining:&#x2014;a greatly improved house; but to me hitherto almost irksome by its total <hi rend="italic">newness.</hi> My old closets, nooks and arrangements are all abolished from existence; my whole possessions in this world are turned topsyturvy; I have to find new places (<hi rend="italic">improved</hi> if you like, but <hi rend="italic">new</hi>) for hanging up my coat, for setting down my shoes, for doing so many things! To a still character, of my years and temper, the sorrow of all this is really considerable;&#x2014;the one remedy, however, is silent exertion at the business; daily to bring it a little nearer to the mark, and <hi rend="italic">have</hi> it all settled again in course of time. In this way I have gloomily been labouring ever since my return, and am yet far enough from thro&#x2019;.&#x2014; In fact, and that is the great secret, I am dreadfully <hi rend="italic">brashed</hi> in soul and body by all these tumults and travels for so many months; and things have, as it were, come to a head with me,&#x2014;the German Voyage, transacted on half-rations of sleep, and this enormous dusty house-repairing, being only like a dish of turpentine flung into what was already a fire. It is sore; but it will be useful, if I can stand faithfully to it! Perhaps a little <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, by and by, will even come out of it; and that, which is my one consolation properly in this life, will be an abundant one. Wish me well; and do not mind me farther.</p>
<p>Jack gave me a 10 minutes visit on friday last; then drove with me for half an hour to the Southwestern Railway station, where we found his new wife waiting. They had come from Tamworth (in the Birmingham region) whither they had gone the first day; and were now proceeding towards Winchester, and Ryde in the Isle of Wight. Jack <hi rend="italic">laughed</hi> much, in happy embarrassment, while with me; both looked &#x201C;happy&#x201C; enough, as natural in such a case. I liked our new Sister too: a fine healthy-looking being; stately in figure; with a rustic comeliness of face, and enough of<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NLS 514.91 ends here.</note> the air of a lady withal. Altogether a promising woman. I think it may prove a very considerable amelioration for <pb id="pg-27-351" n="27:351"/>the poor Doctor; and in the midst of my own confusions, could not but give him my sympathies poor soul. They rolled off towards Winchester, the region where I lately was; they were to stay there a day or two days; then to Ryde, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is also a place known to me, 30 or 40 miles farther in the same region: the time of their return northward was not fixed then. I send a Newspaper today, addressed &#x201C;Post-Office, Ryde, Isle of Wight,&#x201C; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was the appointed Address; but have yet heard nothing. You, if you write, now know it.</p>
<p>This morning I had the inclosed from Isabella, bringing good news of Alick and our poor Mother. You may forward Alick&#x2019;s letter with two stamps to Ryde if you like; Jack will be glad of it and of whatever news you can afford to send him.&#x2014; Poor Jenny&#x2019;s letter did come to The Grange; and made me rather thoughtful about her agues and confused troubles. Alick&#x2019;s news are a little reassuring on both those heads: but I have a feeling that they ought to try for some <hi rend="italic">healthier</hi> situation at any rate.</p>
<p>You got the <hi rend="italic">Critic</hi> &#x26;c the day after I returned home. Ten or twelve newspapers, all accumulated in my absence, went off from me that day. I now send <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>, and some <hi rend="italic">Methodist Magazines</hi>, which latter were also waiting me here,&#x2014;forwarded by an ill-natured critic as you will see. Ill-natured to me, but well-meaning to the world and himself, poor devil; I did not spend above 10 minutes in glancing at his stuff here and there, but it has given me various grave reflexions since. A tremendous Nightmare descending on this poor man, and the universe, to squelch the Methodism wholly out of him and it,&#x2014;unless I <hi rend="italic">be</hi> (as he has a trembling hope) a more tremendous humbug and fool:&#x2014;such is the figure I present to him and to the general well-disposed Blockheadism of England, after all my talking! A really serious tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me.&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>Enough, dear Jean. Yours ever /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I intended well to write to you on Saturday; but people came in, at exactly the wrong moment, and there was no time more. You would gather by the Newspapers sent last week that I had got home again; and that really was the most of what I had to say. I had bundled up a Book for you (the <hi rend="italic">Westm</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>), which goes off at last today; the <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> I have sent to Jean at the same time: but she is instructed to send it over to you if you care in the least to see it. Jack, I think somehow, told me when in Annandale that you never looked into <hi rend="italic">Fraser:</hi> is that so? If it be (which I can well enough understand), the shortest way is evidently what I have now followed, to send it on to <pb id="pg-27-352" n="27:352"/>Dumfries direct. There is but little benefit to be had in any of these trashy Books, or indeed in most Books going at present!</p>
<p>I came home on Tuesday evening last, the wet weather, and futile arrangements otherwise, delayed me a day. Jane had this place all clean of workers at last; clean, as her wont is, and shining with gas at the door, and other lights, to welcome me to tea. I have had a weary struggle every day since, and am not thro&#x2019; it yet, arranging my things in their <hi rend="italic">new</hi> places; an operation rather sad than hopeful to me in my present dull humour: but I must persist till it is done, and then by and by there will be a real improvement. The house is clearly <hi rend="italic">very much</hi> bettered; this room of mine, in particular, and my bedroom upstairs, are or will clearly be perfect <hi rend="italic">beauties</hi> of rooms in their way: let us be patient, &#x201C;<foreign>canny</foreign> as eggs&#x201C;; and the better day <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come at last!&#x2014; I am terribly <hi rend="italic">brashed</hi> with all these tumblings about, in fact; and have not yet fairly recovered my feet: but, with quiet, with pious endeavour, I shall surely do so; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, it will be joyful to see the black tempest lying all behind one, and the &#x201C;bright side&#x201C; of the &#x201C;cloud&#x201C; attained, for one! All clouds have their bright side too: that also is a thing we should remember. On the whole, I hope to get to a little <hi rend="italic">work</hi> again; and that is the consolation which surpasses all for me.</p>
<p>Isabella&#x2019;s Note with Sandy&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle.</note> Letter came this morning: I have already forwarded it to Jean, with direction to send it on to the Doctor where he now is. The Butter Packages came, all safe, on Friday night. Report that all is right there, accordingly. We tried the Butter on Saturday; found even the top surface very fair; and now, this morning, the criticism is, &#x201C;excellent butter indeed!&#x201C; The <hi rend="italic">straw</hi> had got <hi rend="italic">wet</hi>, Jane told me; but neither had the Pitcher got hurt, nor was anything in the least out of joint in the one package or the other. Carriage for both 6 /,&#x2014;which is cheap surely for such a distance! All right, therefore on that hand.</p>
<p>On friday about 2 p.m. Jack plunged in here upon me, as he will probably have told you; drove me off to the Station where his Wife was: in all, we were near an hour together. He was full of <hi rend="italic">flaffing</hi> laughter at his new unexpected position and &#x201C;altogether happy according to circumstances&#x201C; was the definition of both so far as I could see. I liked Mrs John too; a very comely sonsy honest-looking lady of her sort: in a word, one could augur well of the poor D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in this adventurous enterprise, and hope with some confidence that it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> turn out to be a great improvement in his way of life, poor soul! They are gone towards Ryde in the Isle of Wight, as I suppose is known to you by this time; and are to be here again, going northward, we expect, within a fortnight hence.</p>
<p>Thank Isabella many times for all her goodness,&#x2014;not forgetting the good news she sends of our dear old Mother; for which too Another and Higher <pb id="pg-27-353" n="27:353"/>must be thanked Oh take care of yourself, dear Mother; and let us all take care of you, and help to bear your burden now that you are weak: surely God himself commands us that,&#x2014;and it brings &#x26; will bring its own reward. <closer><salute>My blessings are with you, dear Mother, and with them all. Ever your affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Stirling,</salute>
<p>I have read your beautiful little Book,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Cloister Life of Charles V</hi> (<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>).</note> the Copy of it you sent me; and wish to say to you, in some authentic manner, and apart from private gratitudes which ought not to bribe my judgement, that I like your work extremely well indeed. You have read faithfully, in all senses of the word <hi rend="italic">read</hi>,&#x2014;books, mined houses, far-off stony vallies, what of instructive, or promising to instruct, have you not &#x201C;read,&#x201C; and perused with eyes and mind:&#x2014;and, far better and never,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> you have honourably <hi rend="italic">sifted</hi> your reading, and well chosen the corn, blowing away into limbo such cargoes of chaff also which you had! If I add now that the style is to be praised,&#x2014;correct, concise, lucid and sunny (a handsome cross between Scott and Gibbon,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Walter Scott (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>) and Edward Gibbon (<date when="1737-00-00">1737</date>&#x2013;<date when="1794-00-00">94</date>), historians.</note> with a nice dash of satiric goodhumour all the way), what more is to be said? I prophesy an honourable success to your little Book; and feel that, in the best circles (for we have &#x201C;circles&#x201C; from Olympus down to Tartarus again at present), it will be praised by those that themselves deserve praise.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1852-10-23">23 Oct.</date>, for example, called it &#x201C;as pleasant and authentic a book as could well have been produced on this interesting subject.&#x201C; Olympus, the abode of Greek gods; Tartarus is described in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> as being as far below Hades as Heaven is above the earth.</note></p>
<p>For my own part I have read it pleasantly and even profitably, tho&#x2019; I care little or nothing for your big Flemish Kaiser, with his long head and weary hanging jaw, with his remarkably active stomach and remarkably (not to say damnably) torpid soul and conscience, wherever the Catechism and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Reichskanzlei</hi></foreign> [state chancellery] left him;&#x2014;a man <hi rend="italic">without</hi> real originality, and, in that high place and century, very liable to be damned, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think!

Nevertheless, this is what you have done for me in regard to them; this that I described above.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles (<date when="1500-00-00">1500</date>&#x2013;<date when="1558-00-00">1558</date>), Holy Roman Emperor, <date when="1519-00-00">1519</date>&#x2013;<date when="1556-00-00">56</date>, and king of Spain and the Netherlands, <date when="1516-00-00">1516</date>&#x2013;<date when="1556-00-00">56</date>, gave up two of his kingdoms to his son, resigned the imperial crown to his brother, <date when="1556-00-00">1556</date>, and retired to a monastery. Though tolerant of Protestants in Germany, which he regretted after abdication, he failed to reconcile them with the Catholics; he was opposed to Luther and summoned him to the Diet of Worms.

Quot: Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 5:31; Hansons, <hi rend="italic">NE</hi> 420. The day before this (<date when="1852-11-09">9 Nov.</date>), TC had noted in his Journal about the renovations at 5 Cheyne Row: &#x201C;My poor Wife has worn herself to a shadow, fretting and struggling about it; I, sent on my travels since the middle of <date when="1852-07-00">July</date> and only just got finally home, am totally overset, in soul, in body and (I may fear) in breeches-pocket too; and feel that I am drifting towards strange issues in these years and days. Never in my life nearer <hi rend="italic">sunk</hi> in the mud oceans that rage from without and within. My survey of the last 8 or 9 years of my life yields little &#x2018;comfort&#x2019; in the present state of my feelings! Silent weak rage, remorse even (which is not common with me); and on the whole solitude of soul, coupled with a helplessness which are frightful to look upon, difficult to deal with in my present situation. For my <hi rend="italic">health</hi> is miserable too; diseased <hi rend="italic">liver</hi>, I privately perceive, has much to do with the phenomenon;&#x2014;and I cannot yet learn to <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> again,&#x2014;during all my travel I have wanted from a third to a half of my usual sleep. &#x2026; I am growing to perceive that I have become an old man; that the flowery umbrages of summer (such as they were for me!), and also the crops and fruits of autumn, are nearly over for me, and stern <hi rend="italic">winter</hi> only is to be looked for. A grim message;&#x2014;such however as is sent to every man. Oh ye Supreme Powers, thou great Soul of the world that <hi rend="italic">art</hi> just, may I manage this but <hi rend="italic">well;</hi> all sorrow then, and smothered rage, and despair itself, shall have been cheap and welcome!

Sometimes, generally in late years, I think it is. Unusual weights have been thrown on me, <foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott</hi></foreign>, whole mountains of horror and choking impediment!&#x2014;but certainly I have not been strong <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> on my side; often, often, not <hi rend="italic">bold</hi> enough but have fled and shrunk, when I should have stood and defiantly fought. The votes of men, the respectabilities, the &#x26;c, &#x26;c, have been too sacred to me? It must be owned, too, the man has had <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a set of conditions as were not easy to govern, and could not always, by the old law-books, be treated well.&#x201C;</sourceNote><head>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute> A word from me, in these black days, can only be a voice <foreign><hi rend="italic">de Profundis</hi></foreign>; and to you, the noblest of all the human souls I have still on my list in this world, it is perhaps better, for many reasons, that I <hi rend="italic">say</hi> nothing whatever. The proper <hi rend="italic">collapse</hi> out of all these journeyings, tribulations and excitations did not come about till now, till the wet Tuesday evening when I disappeared (as a ghost should) from your bright environments;&#x2014;and ever since, I <pb id="pg-27-355" n="27:355"/>have been at it! &#x201C;Annihilating rubbish,&#x201C; endeavouring to annihilate rubbish: such monstrous Continents of it, spiritual and material, as I cannot recollect to have ever seen before,&#x2014;and with a new assistant, a gentleman named Old Age, looking in upon me; courteously informing me that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will help, for the future, more and more! However, it is something, as I said, to get down fairly to the <hi rend="italic">bottom</hi> of the unutterable gulf, and look fairly into the eyes of your gorgons there,&#x2014;and piously signify to them that they shall not make <hi rend="italic">you</hi> into stone, that they shall themselves be slain, and reduced to ashes, by and by, if it please God!&#x2014; Do not yet altogether quit hope in me. Pray for me in your noble heart: know always that if I ever can reward your heavenly goodness in the least particular, I will do it in the name of Heaven; and that if I never can (as is too evident to me often) I will carry the remembrance of it as a sacred possession whithersoever I may go or be driven. That is the historical truth;&#x2014;nor is it a very strange one after what Fleming has taught me of you! Indeed I altogether agree (on reflexion) with that remarkable man, and even go beyond him (having eyes of my own withal) in what he said on the subject alluded to! And so <foreign><hi rend="italic">pauca verba</hi></foreign>, as Corporal Nym says.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Merry Wives</hi> 1.1.</note> And understand me to be black as <hi rend="italic">Orcus</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hades.</note> extremely ugly indeed in these days; but busy as an indefatigable <hi rend="italic">stoker</hi>, endeavouring to <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> immensities of smoke and coal-culm<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coal mine waste.</note> (as one&#x2019;s hope and duty is) and very recognisant of what heavenly lights there still are. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi, ay de mi!</hi></foreign>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope your visitors have now left you again to peace; I like better to fancy you walking near the silent woods; sitting reflective at midday in your moss-house (<hi rend="italic">if</hi> the weather is dry, and the stove lighted), remembering and readjusting many things. Alas, care and sorrow lie coiled round the horizon of every soul. But I love you for your noble cheerfulness of heart, for your frank courage and ready gracious sense,&#x2014;in fact I love you for several things, and have a confidence that the gods will not desert you, not altogether, at any time!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have seen nobody whatever; it is my hest at present to avoid everybody, <pb id="pg-27-356" n="27:356"/>and live, so far as I may, with closed lips and far from mad noises. The very swearing the Parliament does not affect me;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The new session opened, <date when="1852-11-04">4 Nov.</date></note> I see daily the carpenters working at covered ways for the poor Duke&#x2019;s last journey,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The funeral procession, <date when="1852-11-18">18 Nov.</date>, went from St. James&#x2019;s Park to St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral.</note> and crowds gazing, but I take care to make no inquiry.

I am &#x201C;annihilating rubbish,&#x201C; as you hear, or praying to the gods that they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> help me to annihilate it.&#x2014; We have gone thro&#x2019; Thackeray&#x2019;s Novel; my Wife first, with great admiration &#x201C;for the fine delineations of women&#x201C;; I next, with aversion and contempt mainly for his feline phantasms of &#x201C;women,&#x201C; with many reflexions on his singular fineness of sense and singular want of d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>,&#x2014;and on the whole with fairly more esteem for this Book<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Henry Esmond</hi>.</note> than seemed likely at The Grange. I find the &#x201C;style,&#x201C; both of painting and writing, worthy of peculiar recognition, in general quite excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for clearness, simplicity and grace,&#x2014;and here and there with a fine <foreign><hi rend="italic">adagio</hi></foreign> of affectionate sentimentality, which is almost beautiful, almost pious.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It is with great reluctance that I venture to trouble you in any way; but a kind of necessity compels me; and I trust your good nature will excuse it in a distressed neighbour.</p>
<p>We have the misfortune to be people of weak health in this house; bad sleepers in particular; and exceedingly sensible, in the night hours, to disturbances from sound. On your premises, for some time past, there is a Cock,&#x2014;by no means particularly loud or discordant,&#x2014;whose crowing, would of course be indifferent or insignificant to persons of sound health and nerves; but alas, it often enough keeps us unwillingly awake here, and on the whole <pb id="pg-27-357" n="27:357"/>gives a degree of annoyance which, except to the unhealthy, is not easily conceivable!</p>
<p>If you could have the goodness to remove that small animal; or in any way to render him <hi rend="italic">inaudible from midnight till breakfast-time</hi>, such charity would work a notable relief to certain persons here, and be thankfully acknowledged by them as an act of good neighbourship!&#x2014;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s request &#x201C;was immediately and politely complied with&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">NL</hi> 2:139).</note></p>

<salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
<p>I am gratified to hear that you, and other gentle high-aspiring souls, get some good of the things I have written. Of course you will find contradiction, many things to tolerate; and yet perhaps if I could shew you quite to the bottom of what I mean, there would be less discrepancy than you often painfully feel! But that is not the law of human speech; we must be content to do without that.</p>
<p>I had no recollection, and but for your letter have still not the least impression, of having classed E. Swedenborg<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emanuel Swedenborg (<date when="1688-00-00">1688</date>&#x2013;<date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>), Swedish philosopher, and mystic religious writer, formerly a scientist.</note> among such a set of persons. I spoke at that time from mere common hearsay,&#x2014;rashly, yet without intentional disloyalty. I have since made some personal acquaintance with the man; read several of his Books, what Biographies of him could be heard of;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380802-TC-JJGW-01"><sic>10:141&#x2013;42</sic><corr>TC to JJGW, <date when="1838-08-02">2 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>. TC had listed Swedenborgians with various quacks and imposters, in <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>, in &#x201C;Count Cagliostro,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Critical and Misc. Essays, Works</hi> 28:271.</note> and have reflected for myself on the singular appearance he makes in this world, and the notable message he was sent to deliver to his fellow creatures in that epoch. A man of great and indisputable cultivation, strong mathematical intellect, and the most pious seraphic turn of mind; a man beautiful, loveable and tragical to me, with many thoughts in him, which when I interpret them for myself I find to belong to the high and perennial in human thought:&#x2014;whatever I may conjecture, in my own defence, about the strange impediments, and <hi rend="italic">un</hi>conquerable imprisoning conditions, under which he had to <pb id="pg-27-358" n="27:358"/>live and to meditate, surely I am very far indeed from ranking him, or those that honestly follow him, under any <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>honourable category!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here is a hasty line, to keep your affectionate heart in peace about us. I meant to write on Saturday; but something intervened,&#x2014;besides my reflexion that probably you would not get the Note till Monday.</p>
<p>We have most excessively wet weather; days and nights of it, heavy rain that will not go away,&#x2014;and one day, owing to flooded river, age of moon, and strong east-wind, we had the highest tide I have ever seen here,&#x2014;no water flowing <hi rend="italic">into</hi> any of our houses, but the house-drains all stopt, and water flowing <hi rend="italic">back</hi> thro&#x2019; them, wetting our kitchen-floor among others! We have not seen the like before. At the same time our temperature is extremely <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> for the season; which is not good for poor weak people.&#x2014; Jane complains still of not sleeping, and is <hi rend="italic">feckless</hi> enough, poor thing; but is evidently recovering herself too. All the wretched dirt or nearly all, and the whole of the workmen who made dirt, are now happily out of the house. I have a capital room to sit in; and my nice clean quiet bedroom (with your Picture over the mantelpiece) is a real blessing to me. I am coming into the old <hi rend="italic">bat;</hi> I try to do what I can daily, and keep very still, but am heavy-handed as yet, and cannot get along with any alacrity at all! I must strive along; and many times, <pb id="pg-27-361" n="27:361"/>as you once directed and as I often remember, &#x201C;call upon Patience.&#x201C; &#x201C;Patience, come, lass, and help <hi rend="italic">me</hi>!&#x201C;</p>
<p>Jack and his Wife are to be here tomorrow from the Isle of Wight; Jane heard from him today. She has secured them a nice lodging in this part of the Town, perhaps half a mile from us; and there they can stay at their convenience, till the time for northward comes.</p>
<p>All people are busy with the &#x201C;Duke&#x2019;s Funeral&#x201C; in these parts,&#x2014;which is simply being busy with a big bag of wind and nothingness, as times go! It is indeed a sad and solemn fact for England, that such a man has been called away; the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> perfectly honest and perfectly brave Public man they had; and they ought, in reverence, to reflect on that, and sincerely testify that (if they could), while they commit him to his resting place. But alas for the &#x201C;Sincerity&#x201C;! It is even professedly all hypocrisy, noise, and expensive upholstery; from which a serious mind turns away with sorrow and abhorrence. To cost 40 or 50,000 pounds, they say; and that is but a small portion of the damage!&#x2014; He is &#x201C;lying in state&#x201C; here, in Chelsea College, 10 minutes walk from us,&#x2014;his poor clay surrounded with upholstery pomp;&#x2014;and there is such a crowd to go and see it as never was known before; all the empty fools of creation running! On Saturday which was the first <hi rend="italic">free</hi> day, free to all the public, about six people were killed,&#x2014;fell, and were trampled to death in the enormous crowd, pressing on to such a sight! We heard of a little child that fell; a man picked it up, held it aloft; but having now no elbows to defend himself with, he was soon squeezed powerless, let the child fall, fell himself, and both were trodden flat.&#x2014; Happily we lie on the <hi rend="italic">lee</hi> side of all this, <hi rend="italic">farther</hi> from the Town than it;&#x2014;happily still more, it will all be over on <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi>, and then even rumour will cease talking of it.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Jamie&#x2019;s Newspaper was forgotten last week; not quite by my blame: I now send him two, along with your <hi rend="italic">Leader.</hi> I begin to long for some news of you again, dear Mother, and of Scotsbrig in general. Tell Isabella;&#x2014;an <hi rend="italic">old Herald</hi> with strokes w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be better than nothing! But I will write soon again at any rate.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>
<p>You will oblige me very much by sending me an exact copy of that Letter of Cromwell&#x2019;s you speak of. The utmost degree of <hi rend="italic">exactness</hi> is, of course, the <pb id="pg-27-362" n="27:362"/>chief point in such a matter. In the passages where you may have any doubt as to the writing or sense, perhaps you could take a bit of tracing-paper, and give me a <hi rend="italic">facsimile</hi> of the characters in question, that so I might have myself an opportunity of guessing.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>I have been very ungrateful about those Gifts you sent me! In every Letter, written since, I have forgotten in my hurry to mention them, and no sooner was the Letter gone than I have remembered with regret. I therefore write a word <hi rend="italic">specially</hi> today. Yes, beyond doubt, the excellent bar of Soap arrived; and I instantly took a bit of it, and fitted the same into my shaving-box, my stock being quite out for some time; and ever since, I have shaved and washed with it, remembering my dear Mother daily as I went on. The <hi rend="italic">figs</hi> too were found of excellent quality; and Jane still occasionally roasts or stews a pair of them; but for us also they are not very wholesome,&#x2014;and I think Mazzini &#x26;c will probably get the chief benefit of them,&#x2014;and thank us and you at the same time,&#x2014;being used to that kind of fruit. So all is right on that side; and now I have acknowledged my obligation (the least a man can do), and may return to my confused work again; for that was all my news today.</p>
<p>Here is a Note, received this morning from John, who I think will probably be with you almost as soon as it.&#x2014; Tell him his two Boxes of Books went duly away <hi rend="italic">yesterday</hi> (Thursday) by Pickford&#x2019;s Waggoner, who called for them in consequence of my note.

<p>Yesterday I took a long walk (three hours fast walking, and rather more) into the country, Clapham and Streatham region,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >S of the Thames.</note>&#x2014;solitary in <hi rend="italic">gutta percha</hi> <pb id="pg-27-364" n="27:364"/>shoes; and hope it has done me good.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In sharp contrast TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1852-12-03">3 Dec.</date>, &#x201C;as usual, many things, or almost all things, are conspiring to hinder me from any clear work, or to choke up my power of working altogether. If I do not stand to myself, and to my own cause, it will be the worse for me! Heaven help me, O heaven!&#x2014;But it is so always; the elements of our work lie scattered disorganised, as if in a thick viscous chaotic ocean, ocean illimitable in all its three dimensions; and we must swim and sprawl towards them; must snatch them, and victoriously piece them together as we can. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu!</hi></foreign> Shall I try <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi>, or not try him?&#x201C;</note> The Country is wet as a sponge, but the sky is now tight, and the weather fine. <closer><salute>No more, dear Mother.&#x2014; Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I sent you yesterday a poor couple of Pamphlets, <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> and another; not because I could hope you would get any good of them, or perhaps read at all in either of them; but simply as a remembrance, and because I had nothing better to send. The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Pamphlet, which was about farming, went purely because it <hi rend="italic">came within weight</hi>, and the Post would take it for nothing! The <pb id="pg-27-365" n="27:365"/>poor American &#x201C;Coleman&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Colman (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), Unitarian and agricultural writer; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430529-TC-JAC-01"><sic>16:186</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1843-05-29">29 May 1843</date></corr></ref>.

<p>We are again very damp here, rain breaking out anew, and our street all sloppy and muddy: I understand all the low grounds over this south of England are actually under water; such a rainy time never seen before in these parts. Some say, it will have a chance to <hi rend="italic">cure sick vegetation;</hi> to take the <hi rend="italic">poison</hi> (which has killed potatoes, turnips &#x26;c in late years) out of the Earth, by thoroughly washing it in this manner. Well, if it do so, it will be useful; but in the mean time we cannot praise it as very comfortable;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; on the whole, we have to take it as it comes; and may say truly, &#x201C;Better than we deserve!&#x201C;</p>
<p>Such weather, I am sure, is not wholesome: nevertheless none of us here has suffered materially by it, tho&#x2019; grumbling &#x26; complaining, as is the habit of us both. Poor Jane often cannot get out, and sleeps ill at night, which is the parent of other ill effects. As for me, I go on as heretofore; and struggle away. Five or six days ago, one morning after bathing, I was struck thro&#x2019; the back with a vile, troublesome, tho&#x2019; highly contemptible stroke of <hi rend="italic">rheumatism;</hi> which is not yet quite gone, tho&#x2019; it is now much abated: I respected it so far as to stay one whole day (which was rainy, and the first of the affair) within doors; every day since, I have gone out walking as usual,&#x2014;and have now (in Tom Garthwaite&#x2019;s language) pretty well &#x201C;worked out the <hi rend="italic">streen.</hi>&#x201C; I live, for most part, utterly alone; am busy over my Books and reflexions here; and <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to be not idle, but to get a little work done while time is running on: that is, as heretofore, the grand rule if one could but follow it.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I expected somehow you would write to me again at greater length before I was to answer: but that does not seem to be your view of it; so I will send a word,&#x2014;at this late hour, in the extremest haste (for Lewes &#x26;c have been here, and have cut up my time),&#x2014;it is better so than delaying longer.</p>
<p>We have nothing here but dull mud, black skies, rain, and alas too frequently dispiritment of heart in the solitude one flies to: bad materials for an interesting Letter! On Sunday gone a week a vile <hi rend="italic">lumbago</hi> laid hold of me, moreover; and it sticks by me, tho&#x2019; in a diminished degree, ever since: in fact my nervous-system is in the worst order; and I do not remember being so <hi rend="italic">low</hi>, this long while, as this <hi rend="italic">collapse</hi> of all my German Touring and other diseased toil and excitement have brought me. By way of remedy,&#x2014;which indeed is the only remedy, and if one could get at it, an extremely effectual one,&#x2014;I have tried to fling myself into the chance of a little work again, such as even in this mood I am adequate to do: for the last four days, accordingly, I am steadily&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">translating</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This is &#x201C;A Day with Friedrich&#x201C; by one Fromme, J. W. L. Gleim&#x2019;s nephew; see <hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 19:303&#x2013;21. Gleim had pbd. his nephew&#x2019;s account, but TC marginally noted on the MS, &#x201C;Gleim&#x2019;s edition, brought out in <date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>, the year of Friedrich&#x2019;s death, is now quite gone,&#x2014;the Book undiscoverable. But the Paper was reprinted in an <hi rend="italic">Anekdoten-Sammlung</hi> (Collection of Anecdotes, Berlin, <date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>, 8tes <hi rend="italic">St&#xfc;ck</hi>), where I discover it yesterday (<date when="1852-07-17">17th July 1852</date>) in a copy of mine, much to my surprise&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:304n). The MS is in FC. See also <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:302.</note> since I cannot write. My job, a <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> one, which <pb id="pg-27-367" n="27:367"/>was incumbent on me at any rate, may last still for ten days; and after that perhaps I may be equal to something better. I am learning, too, as you may perceive, to write <hi rend="italic">with an iron pen</hi>,&#x2014;a melancholy task for one so old, but which the revolutionary humour of Papermakers &#x26;c (striving to be &#x201C;cheap and nasty,&#x201C; such is their noble goal) drives me into: and yet I don&#x2019;t think it will do!&#x2014; Enough now of all this.</p>
<p>We are delighted tonight with one thing: the fall of the Derby Ministry;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Its budget had been rejected, <date when="1852-12-16">16 Dec.</date> (in fact early morning, <date when="1852-12-17">17 Dec.</date>), by nineteen votes. It resigned after the adjourned debate, Mon. <date when="1852-12-20">20 Dec.</date></note> never to rise again, it is hoped! <hi rend="italic">Such</hi> a set of vilenesses, take them for all in all, had not appeared in British history before; and it is comfortable that the general British so-called &#x201C;mind&#x201C; has, amid all its fearful obstructions, found means to cast <hi rend="italic">them</hi> off again. Old Lansdowne, they say, is trying to make a &#x201C;Coalition Ministry&#x201C; of some kind,&#x2014;more power to his elbow!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> said, <date when="1852-12-18">18 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;The course of events, the state of parties, and the predominant conviction and desires of the country, point to the <supplied>[Conservative]</supplied> colleagues of the late Sir Robert Peel as the men from whom the Liberal party must now look for the most effectual assistance, in conjunction with whatever remains available of the last Whig Administration.&#x201C; It thought that Lord Landsdowne might be asked to head the new ministry, but would decline.</note> A worse ministry than we have had even he (one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think) cannot well contrive to make.</p>
<p>Farie passed near you the other day, when you knew not of it; he is gone to the North, poor fellow, to pass some of the dark months: in London he was very idle and resourceless.&#x2014; Jones, at the Library, shewed me your <hi rend="italic">B&#xE9;ranger</hi> beautifully bound;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Work by Pierre-Jean B&#xE9;ranger (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), French poet.</note> I told him you would probably write, for it and some other Books, before long. If there is anything I can do in regard to that or any other concern here, you can let me know.</p>
<p>I have been paying my <hi rend="italic">Builder</hi> and other House-Artists: Accounts dreadfully <hi rend="italic">uncomfortable</hi> most ways (some 40 per cent <hi rend="italic">dearer</hi> than I expected, for one thing!): but it is good to get them put by, and dismissed forever from one&#x2019;s memory; that is the one good one can do in them.</p>
<p>Neuberg is here; has taken influenza, got out of it again, and is not a beauty at all! He seems to propose living about Hampstead; not liking your old Lodging (or rather this dark quarter of the Town) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Jane took him to.&#x2014; I have heard nothing of my poor old Mother since a day or so after your Note, when Isabella wrote. You I hope are getting all things brought more and more into straight condition in your new habitation and way of life. <closer><salute>I send, from the <pb id="pg-27-368" n="27:368"/>bottom of my heart, a thousand good-wishes to my Sister and you; and say abruptly, Good night!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear good Mother,</salute>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">intended</hi> to write you a much longer Letter; but, alas, my time is completely up; and you must, as in so many other case, take the will for the deed. This poor word will be better than none at all.</p>
<p>I have got now upon a little bit of work, suitable to my confused condition and mood,&#x2014;a kind of <hi rend="italic">Translation</hi> relating to Frederic, which I can work at steadily in any humour; and for the last week I am busy indeed! It will last me about another 8 days or more, and by that time, I shall perhaps see better ahead a little. Who knows? At any rate this thing needed to be done; and the doing of it is a noticeable contentment to me.</p>
<p>We have now <hi rend="italic">again</hi> a prospect of getting done with this endless wet weather! Such weather was never seen in these parts before; nothing but mud, dark skies and soaking rain or drizzle. I shall be right glad when it ends; for it seems my <hi rend="italic">back</hi>, withal, won&#x2019;t get properly well till the skies clear: it is now nothing to speak of, nor indeed ever was, and, the worst form of it only lasted 3 days; but the dirty feeling that lodges in the part (and indeed comes out of <hi rend="italic">the liver</hi>, as I perceive) shall be very welcome to go, and will do it, I calculate, so soon as the weather mends. Jane is pretty well for her; and goes out almost daily (in some fair blink) in spite of the weather.</p>
<p>Our scandalous Protection Ministry, we rejoice to know, is gone again! It was turned out on Friday (or rather Thursday night); and the Whigs are now trying to form a &#x201C;Coalition&#x201C; &#x26;c: tho&#x2019; nothing is settled yet.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The debate on Thurs., <date when="1852-12-16">16 Dec.</date>, finished at 4 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi>, Fri., <date when="1852-12-17">17 Dec.</date> The Peelites (or Grahamites) voted against the govt., which after heated personal exchanges had been largely brought down by the Conservative Gladstone, in favor of a new coalition of Whigs and Peelites under Lord Aberdeen.</note> Whatever they form, it will hardly be so ugly as that vile Jew swindler was;&#x2014;&#x201C;lineal descendant of the Impenitent Thief,&#x201C; as O&#x2019;Connel<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel O&#x2019;Connell (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), the Irish politician, in his Dublin speech of <date when="1835-05-02">2 May 1835</date>, called Disraeli a liar, with &#x201C;just the qualities of the impenitent thief on the Cross,&#x201C; and the &#x201C;lineal descendent of the blasphemous robber, who ended his career beside the Founder of the Christian Faith&#x201C;; see <hi rend="italic">Benjamin Disraeli Letters, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date></hi>, ed.

<p>From the Doctor we have heard nothing since Jamie saw him, when he wrote us a Note about you. Isabella&#x2019;s Note came also; for which our kind thanks. We long much to hear of you dear Mother; and are continually sensible of our mercy in your respect. Oh take care of yourself; I intreat them all to take care of you! I shall get another Note before long? I will myself write one before long.&#x2014; <closer><salute>The very daylight is now leaving me, and I must s<supplied>[ay]</supplied> <foreign>Adieu</foreign>. Perhaps you won&#x2019;t get this tomorrow after all? Never mind, never mind! my <hi rend="italic">thoughts</hi> will be with you whether or not!&#x2014;Blessings on you all.</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute> Along with this comes, in brown-paper cover, the Catalogue of Prints I spoke about. On Sunday, which is my day of rest, I look it over for the second time; marked (see first page) all the Pieces I thought you had any <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> to care about: you can look them over for yourself, when you have time, and are in the humour for such an enterprise; please then to send me your orders about them, and the ready Neuberg (gone <hi rend="italic">to Hampstead</hi>, happily) shall at once set about fulfilling them. I dare say there are far more Prints marked than you want actually to have; but that was the safe side to err on; being all by Vandyke,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Anthony Van Dyke (<date when="1599-00-00">1599</date>&#x2013;<date when="1641-00-00">1641</date>), Flemish-born painter and etcher.</note> and carefully engraved (as appears), it is to be expected they are true likenesses, for one thing. Neuberg says, this Weber of Bonn is now one of the chief Print-dealers, or altogether the chief, in Germany; a very honest man, and has Prints <hi rend="italic">cheap.</hi> He is gathering, for Neuberg, what he calls a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">set</hi> of Chodowieckis&#x201C; (not a <hi rend="italic">tithe</hi> of the whole, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think) for &#x201C;30 thalers,&#x201C; about &#xa3;5! I can make nothing of that speculation,&#x2014;and consider it not advisable for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in the meantime, did your vagrant tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> ever point in that direction! And so enough of Prints.</p>
<p>I fancy you very busy, with guests, with preparations for childrens&#x2019; Christmas,&#x2014;with, at one time, the danger of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> conjurors coming upon you together. That danger is over; may all others go like <hi rend="italic">it!</hi> Be merry, be happy in your work of rural bounty; and may many an old poor soul, and many a hopeful simple young one, be filled with thanks and pleasure by your means. It is one of the opportunities these evil times do offer the like of you; and it is <pb id="pg-27-370" n="27:370"/>well and beautiful that you make the most of it. Ah me!&#x2014; But surely this thing ought not to make me sad; as, it was said once to me, <hi rend="italic">everything</hi> does: quite the same what &#x201C;things&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">are</hi>&#x2014;to me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have a kind of joy here, as good citizens, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> affects even me, in the destruction of that scandalous Jew-Swindler and the Derby Ministry he was doing stump-oratory sleight-of-hand for! A. Helps and I met a clerical old gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, a friend of his, on the street yesterday, who broke out &#x201C;Glory to the 19&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">majority</hi> on thursday night),&#x2014;which I did not at first understand. All people that I see are very glad; and have once more (poor souls) a kind of hope that &#x201C;something will be done.&#x201C; Thus too Micawber<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Dickens&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">David Copperfield</hi> (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">50</date>).</note> always hoped &#x201C;something would turn up!&#x201C; Better to say, No, there will nothing turn up; since I do nothing myself, there will nothing be done,&#x2014;of the least use to me, at any rate!</p>
<p>Our weather is mended for the last 3 days; today is as bright as summer; quite a blessing to behold after these deluges. My villainous lameness (known only to myself, of late, indeed) fades likewise slowly away, leaves not a wreck behind;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Tempest</hi> 4.1.</note> and in fact I feel always as if, behind these black temporary miseries, I were not worse than usual, perhaps even fundamentally better,&#x2014;were I once thoroughly <hi rend="italic">rested</hi>, i.e. steeped in the mud of my own reflexions for a couple of months, and then washed clean:&#x2014;but alas, my whole soul seems fallen <hi rend="italic">rheumatic</hi>, and my whole existence needs such vigour if I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not lose it quite! In fine, O beautiful Lady, it is too true the humble individual now addressing you has been dreadfully put upon, by men or devils or both,&#x2014;and is ugly and sore, and not Caliban but a cramp!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Tempest</hi> 5.1.</note> Let him hold his peace, for one thing&#x2014;the wretch!</p>
<p>I have been translating something, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Lord A. and you shall see one day; unluckily it is now quite near an ending. I also read little Lord Johnny&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">T. Moore</hi>:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Memoirs, Journal, and Correspondence of Thomas Moore</hi>, ed. Lord John Russell, 2 vols. (<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>); four more vols. later.</note> very chaotic, rather weak throughout; but there is autobiography, there are Diaries in it,&#x2014;on the whole, perhaps it is worth y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> getting.

<salute>Dear Redwood,</salute>
<p>Last night, according to your Christian custom, the well-replenished Christmas Box arrived:&#x2014;clear that there is in the Western wildernesses, a human soul remaining who thinks humanly of us, &#x26; in this mute way sends greeting and remembrance to us! A thousand thanks to you, for this steady feeling, so modestly expressed, and so faithfully maintained in spite of years and accidents: in a world like ours, such things are precious, and are not very common, if my experience may be trusted!&#x2014; The edible commodities were all in perfect order, I am told; and will do their <hi rend="italic">other</hi> and secondary duties by and by, also in (I doubt not) a pleasant and creditable manner.&#x2014; Alas, there is not to be a very &#x201C;merry christmas&#x201C; here this year; and with me in particular it is appointed to be fully as <hi rend="italic">lonely</hi>, for one thing, as it can be at Boverton with you. By many causes I am in a very low condition (of bodily humour) just at this time; and it has been settled, that I eat my Christmas dinner <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, on the present occasion; my Wife going out that day, and leaving me to my Books and reflexions, as the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> method in so complex a case. I will eat a chop of that excellent Welsh mutton; and reflect, profitably I hope, on many things,&#x2014;undisturbed by any &#x201C;confused nonsense,&#x201C; except my own only, and therefore &#x201C;happier&#x201C; than usual, and with some possibility of advantage, not with the impossibility of it as elsewhere!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The truth is, we have got far awry here; tho&#x2019; I ought to add, we are coming straight again! Our case is mainly this. Last summer it was decided that (a <hi rend="italic">Lease</hi> being now procurable) this House should be &#x201C;thoroughly repaired.&#x201C; Builders &#x26;c were accordingly consulted; &#x201C;six weeks&#x201C; was the limit of time assigned; money &#x201C;not much&#x201C;; and hope of all kinds was the presiding genius of the enterprise. Let no man henceforth give his house a thorough repair! The artificers, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the <date when="1852-07-01">1st of July</date> last, arrived one morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> with their picks and barrows; raged and tore and thumped, thro&#x2019; three weeks of the hottest weather, bringing out mere mountains of old planks, old bricks and dust and desperation,&#x2014;six <hi rend="italic">months</hi> evidently not like to end them. My poor Wife, at this point, packed me away into Scotland; undertook to pilot the work herself into port: I exhausted Scotland,&#x2014;two months, continual sleeplessness, and other misery;&#x2014;and still on the farthest horizon no hope of the hurlyburly ending. &#x201C;Come not hither!&#x201C; she said now: &#x201C;Go to Germany,&#x2014;without me; I am indispensable here, and will not go; you, off!&#x201C; I went, by Holland, Rhineland, Frankfurt, Cassel, Weimar Dresden,&#x2014;up the Elbe, down the Oder, to <pb id="pg-27-372" n="27:372"/>Berlin &#x26; home; grew <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> daily, ten times worse in the end (for I had not one night&#x2019;s sleep all the time, if you know what that means!): in short, it is not yet many weeks since we got the last of the unclean creatures (Painters and varnishers) out of the house,&#x2014;and they have to come back, next summer, and &#x201C;finish <hi rend="italic">everything</hi>&#x201C;: what think you of a &#x201C;thorough repair&#x201C; on those terms? Of the money, tho&#x2019; it is some 40 per cent more than I expected, there shall nothing be said:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thackeray, on a reading tour, wrote to Lady Ashburton from New York, <date when="1852-12-14">14 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;Does Carlyle want a couple of thousand pounds?&#x2014;let him come here. O its a great country for dollars. I send my best remembrances to all who care for them&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note> but the &#x201C;general <hi rend="italic">collapse</hi>,&#x201C; out of all this long-continued misery and excitment, has been such a state of body, soul and spirits, as requires all my philosophy to guide it wisely! Hence comes my solitary Christmas; hence come several things. My poor Wife, too, has suffered a good deal; but is not nearly so low as I; and, I flatter myself, appears to be mending faster.&#x2014; Let me not forget to add, indeed, that I too am mending; that the House is actually not a little improved for the rest of one&#x2019;s life;&#x2014;that, in fact, I have a feeling as if, <hi rend="italic">at bottom</hi>, my poor overwearied nerves are perhaps clearer and sounder than before;&#x2014;and thus on the whole that all shall be well that ends well!&#x2014; Enough enough.</p>
<p>I am not quite idle, tho&#x2019; I cannot, even in the language of flattery, be described as <hi rend="italic">working</hi> in a visible manner. Frederick the Great has cost me huge reading, and it was after him alone or mainly that I kept inquiring in Germany lately: nevertheless it seems to me I never can embark in writing a Book about him, so little lovely is the man to me; so dim, vague, faint and contemptible is the acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I get of his life-element, is (too often) his life-element itself to me! He will walk the plank, I think or has walked it; and I must try something else. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Redwood I send you many grateful tho<hi rend="italic">ts;</hi> and am silent!&#x2014; Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I indeed did not know that I was in your debt; but on the contrary was longing to hear from you! I have at any rate been very <hi rend="italic">low</hi> in the humour lately, a little busy too, and very much averse to write. However, here goes some line or two, such as there is. Beggarly paper and pen withal! I am quite driven out of my latitude with that everlasting botheration of ever-changing <pb id="pg-27-373" n="27:373"/>paper, which has never been at rest for the last twenty years; and at this late period of my life, am seriously thinking (and trying, as you see) to learn to write with iron pens. The troubles that afflict the just!</p>
<p>Our weather here has been worse, I venture to say, than yours; incessant drizzle, rain, mud and darkness: such a tract of abominable weather as I literally never saw before in my life. Add to which, my poor liver (and alas, I think, my poor <hi rend="italic">life</hi> <supplied>[ &#x2026; ]</supplied>: I have had such a <hi rend="italic">tumble-down</hi> out of my summer&#x2019;s excitations and fatigues as has not often befallen me; and, in the <supplied>[sol]</supplied>itude of these wet days, have got into <hi rend="italic">burbles</hi> with myself without end;&#x2014;in fact, all things are one huge <hi rend="italic">burble</hi> with me (I often think), and I have to squat close in the corner, and &#x201C;work maistly in a place by mysel&#x2019;&#x201C; till once we rally a little, if we can! About three weeks ago, to crown all, there came into my unfortunate back, on the sudden one morning, a thing they call <hi rend="italic">lumbago (back-rheumatism)</hi>, and I walked about for some time stiff as a poker,&#x2014;ready to rush down, such a keen twinge was there, every time I came off the strict perpendicular in my walking! That is now pretty much gone again:&#x2014;and in brief, to speak seriously, and end all this rigmarole, I believe I am really getting better at last; and, by persisting in this solitary course of quietude, patience and silence, I sometimes hope I shall really have made a perceptible <hi rend="italic">general</hi> improvement when the account is all settled.&#x2014;We have not had a day of frost yet; and the wind is piping tonight against my windows, fresh out of the west as if it were just beginning.</p>
<p>Poor Jane is not well either; sleeps very ill &#x26;c; but struggles along in hope of better times: it is she that sees all the company down-stairs, as she rather likes to do than otherwise; I sit aloft here, and am absent strictly to all but a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> selec<supplied>[t &#x2026; ]</supplied> got no steady work begun yet; and shall not, I fear, for a long time! That is the root of all my miseries; or rather the one misery which alone I care a snuff for: but I cannot help it just yet; I must <foreign><hi rend="italic">plouter</hi></foreign> away, mud up to the chin, till I do find the rocks under my feet again, and get upon a road that will carry me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Frederick the Great&#x201C; continues very questionable: nobody yet could say, I should ever fairly <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to write a Book about him! The sight of actual Germany, with its flatsoled puddlings in the slough of nonsense (quite a different kind of nonsense from ours, but not a whit less genuine) has hurt poor <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi> (Freddy) very much in my mind: poor fellow, he too lies deep-buried in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">midden-stank</hi></foreign> even as Cromwell did; and then he is not half or tenth-part such a man as Cromwell, that one should swim and dive for him in that manner! In fact tho&#x2019; I have not yet quitted the neighbourhood of Fritz and his old cocked-hat, his fate is very uncertain with me; and every new German <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> I read about him, my feeling is, All up with Fritz. In Germany I could not even get a good Portrait of him,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; they spend the year round in singing dull insincere praises to him in every key; and have built a huge <pb id="pg-27-374" n="27:374"/>bronze and granite monument to him, in Berlin as big as your mid-steeple,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Dumfries, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340304-TC-JWE-01"><sic>7:112</sic><corr>TC to JWE, <date when="1834-03-04">4 March 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> at the cost of perhaps half a million, which is <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> next to nothing, or nothing <supplied>[ &#x2026; ]</supplied> and fools, after their sort, as we are after <supplied>[ &#x2026; ]</supplied> oh me! They have the mask of his dead face, however; a fiercely shrivelled plaster-cast;&#x2014;lips and chin and bottom of the nose I recollect as perfectly the image of our old <hi rend="italic">Aunt Fann</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aunt Fann or Fanny, his father&#x2019;s sister, survived till <date when="1834-02-26">26 Feb. 1834</date>; she had m. William Brown, to whom TC&#x2019;s father was apprenticed as a mason; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 25&#x2013;26 and <hi rend="italic">CL</hi> <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340327-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:120</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-03-27">27 March 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> if you remember her, in those features! The face of a <hi rend="italic">lean lion</hi>, or else partly, alas! of a ditto <hi rend="italic">cat!</hi> The lips are thin, and closed like pincers; a face that never yielded;&#x2014;not the beautifullest kind of face. In fine why sh<hi rend="italic">d I</hi> torment my domestic soul writing his foreign history? He may go to&#x2014;France for me!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>All people are getting ready their Christmas eatables here; determined upon doing a stroke of work that way. Such walls of fat beef, such wildernesses of plucked turkeys, eyes never saw: &#x201C;all from the country, ma&#x2019;am!&#x201C; The poor people, who cannot buy, stand in crowds in speechless approval and generous admiration of those who can. I, for my part, am to dine alone on Christmas day; Jane is going with a Cousin of hers<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh.</note> (son of George Welsh once of Boreland), and I think partly for the sake of him, to some gay party; and I will abide here by my papers and my &#x2019;bacco, and escape indigestions at any rate.&#x2014; Likewise all the world is busy baking a new ministry; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is to be laid upon the peel, and go into the oven, they say, this very night. A &#x201C;coalition&#x201C; of Whigs and Grahamites,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Followers of Sir James Graham (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11204"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), who had refused office under Lord John Russell, but, as a Peelite, had supported him against the protectionists. Graham was to be first lord of the admiralty in the new govt.</note> or I know not what: not good, but compared with the late Derby swindle, and <hi rend="italic">its</hi> abominable Jew Stump Orator and Impenitent Thief, it will be lovely for a season, and a relief to all eyes! Poor Protectionist Pigheads, there never were men so &#x201C;sold,&#x201C; since <hi rend="italic">Judas</hi> concluded his trade. <hi rend="italic">This</hi> Jew however will not hang himself; no, I calculate he has a great deal more of vile work to do in the world yet, if he live. Whatever brutish Infatuation has money in its purse, votes in its pocket, and no tongue in its head, here is the man to be a tongue for it (rather than be <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h is</hi> his function, could he believe it) and to use all his &#x201C;fine intellect&#x201C; to put words in its mouth. In fact, he is not a beautiful man to me at all, that one;&#x2014;and so we will leave him, in a plight, for the present, that is rather suitable to him.</p>
<p>Jack writes with as much <hi rend="italic">brevity</hi> as ever; a Note of two or three vague lines <pb id="pg-27-375" n="27:375"/>come tonight: our poor old Mother was &#x201C;in her usual way on Tuesday last&#x201C;; poor Mrs John has had a bad sore-throat (which she is subject to in winter, it is now past the worst but not yet well by any means. I have had nothing direct from Scotsbrig for about ten days; and then it was merely a <hi rend="italic">bulletin</hi>, but a favourable one, for which I was very thankful.</p>
<p>Poor old M&#x2019;Diarmid, we shall see him no more, then!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M&#x2019;Diarmid died at Dumfries, <date when="1852-11-18">18 Nov.</date>, of erysipelas.

He never writes;&#x2014;nor indeed do I! <closer><salute>Give my kind regards to him; silent, but as sincere as if they were louder.</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>I could go on scribbling a long while in this way (in spite of my <hi rend="italic">grating</hi> iron pen, or by help of it); but the candles are burning down, and I have other writing to do before bedtime come. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Sister; rejoice that you live in quiet rather than in noise; continue, like a brave woman, to recognise loyally the mercies and genuine opulences of your lot,&#x2014;to make the most of what is good, and to bear with silent courage, humanity and nobleness, what of evil is not to be cured: you will reduce it to a <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> in this way; and mortal can do no more.</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>Commend me to James; and wish him well thro&#x2019; his accounts. Kind wishes to all the <foreign>Bairns</foreign>. Good be with you and yours, dear Jean; that is my heart&#x2019;s prayer.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
<p>I had the honour to receive, the other day, your obliging Gift,&#x2014;six Engravings of the <hi rend="italic">Frederick Monument</hi> with accompanying Letterpress, and one on <pb id="pg-27-376" n="27:376"/>large paper splendidly bound;&#x2014;for which welcome and unexpected mark of your attention I beg now to return many thanks.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Monument of Frederick the Great King of Prussia Inaugurated <date when="1851-05-31">May 31, 1851</date></hi> (Berlin, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>). TC&#x2019;s copy, with many annotations, is at Yale.</note> It would also give me great pleasure to treat with you about a Translation of any work of mine on F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Great;&#x2014;but, alas, that part of the business lies as yet far over the horizon, and is only to be counted among the good things which may never come at all!</p>
<p>I have indeed, for the last year or more, been reading many Books about Frederick, and making many inquiries about his existence in this world,&#x2014;as I have repeatedly done at various times of my life, your Great King, and his Warfarings, and manful struggles and endeavours here below, having from of old been an object of great curiosity with me:&#x2014;but as to writing any Book upon him, I confess I dare not set that before <supplied>[me]</supplied> as an object, or confidently hope at all to get the matter so illuminated for myself as to vindicate such a procedure! Alas, no; probably never. The character of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> himself is, long since, abundantly <hi rend="italic">luminous</hi> to me (his own Writings being there to tell <supplied>[me]</supplied> of that); but in regard to his Environment (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Umgebung</hi></foreign>) in all features of it, the case is still lamentably different with me; and multitudes of Books that I read thr<supplied>[ow]</supplied> no new light on it whatever. I want greatly some B<supplied>[ook]</supplied> with intelligible Biographies of Friedrich&#x2019;s Generals;&#x2014;some intelligible Book of <hi rend="italic">Prussian Topography</hi> would even be welcome to me;&#x2014;and the Princely Houses and distinguished Persons he stood connected with, are inexpressibly obscure to a foreign reader. It strikes me often I must have chosen my Books ill; or else learned Deutschland must, with all its writing, be lamentably deficient in these helps to Historical study? Not even an available Prussian <hi rend="italic">Peerage-Book</hi> could I hear tell of; I bought one (<hi rend="italic">Neukirsch&#x2019;s Adels-Lexicon</hi>) which is no better than waste paper for any such purpose!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron Leopold von Zedlitz-Neukirch, <hi rend="italic">Neues Preussisches Adels-Lexicon</hi>, 6 vols. and 2 supplements (Leipzig, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">43</date>).</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>In short you perceive, Gentlemen, I am still in the fatal impossibility of getting due instruction about F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Great; and shall, too probably, always continue so: in which circumstances the writing of a Book upon him would be an offence clearly <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be committed. I can only try and repeat, if I ever did write such a Book, it would give me pleasure to treat with you about it in the way you propose;&#x2014;and so, in the meanwhile, with many thanks for your kindness to me,</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am delighted to hear of you again; and in answering the Herrn Decker, cannot forbear to send you my compliments and acknowledgements. The kindness and frankness with which you treated me at Berlin; the ready charity with which you listened to my confused questions; and the great quantity of information and direction which I got, or perceived I could have got, from you: all this remains in vivid and grateful remembrance with me;&#x2014;and I beg you to understand that it does and will do so.</p>
<p>I continue my studies on Frederick; but without any adequate success hitherto. So much remains obstinately dark on all sides of the luminously Great Man! The Anhalt-Dessaus, the W&#xfc;rtembergs, Sachsen-Gothas &#x26;c &#x26;c;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >All princely families. The Anhalt-Dessaus produced distinguished generals during the eighteenth cent. The W&#xfc;rtembergs of the duchy of that name were mostly Protestants. Sachsen <supplied>[Saxe]</supplied>-Gotha was the name of the ducal house of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha before it acquired Coburg in <date when="1672-00-00">1672</date>; it also fought on the Protestant side in the Thirty Years&#x2019; War.</note> nay the very Generals and Officers of Frederick&#x2019;s Armies; much more his daily companions (if one goes into practical details) and the general mode of Prussian Existence in his day,&#x2014;remains fearfully <hi rend="italic">chaotic</hi> after all one&#x2019;s inquiring; and is likely to be at last (in the words of our Milton) mere &#x201C;darkness visible,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 1:62.</note> to a stranger! As I am reading the big noisy and empty <hi rend="italic">Pauli</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Ber&#xfc;hmter Helden</hi> &#x26;c)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl Friedrich Pauli, <hi rend="italic">Leben Grosser Helden des Gegenw&#xE4;rtigen Krieges</hi>, 3 vols.

<p>I have sometimes thought of putting together a series of questions, to be addressed to you for what reply there is; and of course your Letter gives me new encouragement towards such a procedure,&#x2014;which is likely enough actually <pb id="pg-27-378" n="27:378"/>to take place one day, in full confidence of finding indulgence from you at least.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your two Letters have come; for which I owe many thanks: I have got, as usual, no other news of my poor Mother; concerning whom it is always a charity to write to me.</p>
<p>The bad weather had abated for three days; Christmas, and the day before and those that followed, were extremely fine, and yesterday we had hopes of a little dry interval and frost: but within the last hour all is overcast again, and our old friend the Rain at his sorry work. My rheumatisms &#x26;c are pretty much in abeyance, however; and I hope to get into my old routine, with not <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the load I am used to bear, before it be very long, in spite of weather, which in that case shall be very indiff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me. Work, in the steady way one likes it, is hitherto not possible,&#x2014;at least not in the <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> direction: I cannot decide to fling it all aside, neither is there yet any visible goal or route for me in the matter; difficulties of which, it is evident, there <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be no remedy except in myself and what exertions I can make towards clearness. A stout hearty fellow, for making &#x201C;exertions,&#x201C; just now! However, we must not get pettish, or quite disheartened; we must toil on, the best we can, in all circumstances, even in these, while life is still left. There is an inexorable character in our History here below; and the most beneficent Deities insist ultimately, with a frightful strictness, upon what has turned out to be <hi rend="italic">fact!</hi></p>
<p>We had Brookfield here on Christmas Night; him by lucky accident, and poor John Welsh by design, to help away with Redwood&#x2019;s annual Welsh mutton: a more pleasant evening, thanks to B., than it might otherwise have been.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. H. Brookfield spent Christmas Day with the Carlyles while his wife was away. He stopped at Cheyne Row for a short visit, but JWC persuaded him to dine with them. Brookfield noted in his diary: &#x201C;The repast &#x2026; was soup, followed by a haunch of wonderfully Lilliputian but good mutton with potatoes. Carlyle either felt or affected humorous despair at having to carve this joint, and consulted me, finally turning it over to me. &#x2026; Carlyle now and then put a bit of what he thought one ought to like &#x2026; on one&#x2019;s plate with a sort of genial, homely hospitality which was touching. &#x2026; Meanwhile, the talk was incessant but remarkable for nothing but cheeriness. Then came woodcocks, and finally a Christmas plum pudding with brandy sauce. &#x2026; After dinner and wine C. and I adjourned upstairs for a pipe of York River Tobacco&#x2014;over which he talked characteristically, chiefly about Education. Then downstairs to cheerful tea&#x2014;and so made end at ten o&#x2019;clock, and I went home in an omnibus with the silent cousin [John Welsh] &#x2026; bearing with me half a dozen old pipes of C.&#x2019;s, and the one he had used that evening for a memorial of a day that I felt very grateful for and not a little elated by. / Next day I met the industrious Flea [Henry Fleming] on Vauxhall Platform. &#x2026; He asked me &#x2018;And what did you do with yourself, yesterday, Brookfield?&#x2019; &#x2018;Oh!&#x2019; I replied, &#x2018;I dined with a great man which I am always proud to tell of.&#x2019; &#x2018;What, Lord Lonsdale?&#x2019; &#x2018;Goodness, no! I dined with Carlyle.&#x2019; &#x2018;Ah! you are right&#x2014;he is truly a great man&#x2014;quite a pigmy amidst the giants that surround him&#x2019; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:380&#x2013;81).</note> That is the extent of our Christmas gaieties;&#x2014;one indigestion, or <pb id="pg-27-379" n="27:379"/>partial indigestion, is enough, in honour of the &#x201C;sacred season&#x201C;; and we have remained steadily at home and quiet otherwise. The &#x201C;sacred season,&#x201C; by the way, is surely rather curious here: the people feel it a <hi rend="italic">command of Heaven</hi> (very superfluous, one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think), really something like a command, to eat roast turkey and be jolly all round; and &#x201C;Christ,&#x201C; who gives his name to the thing, serves merely, in this time, as a kind of painted cobweb to shut Eternity and its too stern facts <hi rend="italic">out of sight:</hi> &#x201C;Drink away, my jolly ones; no fear of being damned after all; the thrice excellent entity called Christ is there!&#x201C;&#x2014; This is a curious posture of affairs; and by no means the most blameable result realised out of it, for the English posterity of Adam just now!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote to his sister, <date when="1852-12-27">27 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;Yesterday evening Carlyle said, &#x2018;English people at Christmas eat themselves as full as they can hold from a feeling of religious duty, and lay it all to Christ.&#x2019; I was there at tea; the maid was out holidaying; so we made the toast at the parlour fire, and I helped Mrs. C. to carry the tea-things up and down stairs. Quite Arcadian! C. made me a present of the new edition (fourth) of <hi rend="italic">Hero Worship.</hi> He said that nothing astonished him so much as that the people continued to buy his books. It was as marvellous as the feeding of Elisha by the ravens. I left at half-past ten, and they both escorted me the greater part of the way&#x201C; (Sadler 289).</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have, as you may guess, been very busy getting our new Ministry on foot in these last ten days. It is all finished now, and gone to its partridge-shooting, for some weeks: I cannot say that I disapprove of it in any marked particular, nor approve of it either; all as well as could be hoped, <hi rend="italic">and no better:</hi> a fatal conviction haunts me, not to my joy, that the whole machine is daily crumbling down and will <hi rend="italic">plunge</hi> down, one day before long, into nameless ruin: may I <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be there to see! The Duke of Argyll, poor little redheaded highhearted man, is in the Cabinet; of which I am glad: L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> John is going <hi rend="italic">out</hi>, or as good as out, &#x201C;in six weeks,&#x201C; which also is not the worst of news. He is to make room for Lord Clarendon;&#x2014;thenceforth merely to &#x201C;emancipate the Jews,&#x201C; and &#x201C;lead in the House of Commons.&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The earl of Aberdeen was to form a coalition govt. of Whigs and Peelites, <date when="1852-12-28">28 Dec.</date>, in which the duke of Argyll was lord privy seal.

<salute>Dear Clough,</salute>
<p>Your pleasant, luminous and wholesome little Note reached me duly a few days ago; with friendly welcome, interest, and thankfulness, on my part. I am very glad indeed to hear of your safe arrival, and outlooks of modest progress, in those Transatlantic regions: the Note gives me light not only on that principal matter; but communicates, in outline, some real traits of the physiognomy of Yankeeland, more pertinently characteristic, and visible to the mind, than I have got out of certain deliberate volumes read by me before now.</p>
<p>There seems no doubt but your extremely moderate expectations will be realized to the full in your new arena: plenty of pupils, I can well fancy, and in general &#x201C;more elbow-room&#x201C; than a poor unprotected male, with no public stamp of orthodoxy clapt upon him, but rather with the reverse, can expect to fall in with in this country. Be diligent in business,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">volto sciolto, bocca stretta</hi></foreign> [open visage, closed mouth],<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> as a general rule;&#x2014;do your very best; and fear nothing. If I might venture to add another precept, tho&#x2019; I know not that it is or ever was necessary in your case, I would say: Be careful of all the cash you gain;&#x2014;and come home to us, next summer, with the largest stock of ammunition you can!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clough had said, <date when="1852-12-03">3 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;I rather look forward to coming over for a few weeks next summer and returning here; but it is too soon to think of it; people say that I shall have pupils enough as I go on, and certainly there seems to be much more elbow room here than within the circle of the Twopenny post.&#x201C;</note> But, at any rate, do not neglect to <hi rend="italic">come;</hi> unless your outlooks where you are be brighter there than one expects, or than they hitherto are. We have a <hi rend="italic">Change of Ministry</hi> now, grand &#x201C;Coalition,&#x201C; with Whig elements, <pb id="pg-27-381" n="27:381"/>Peel d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> in still greater abundance, and a severe old Lansdown presiding (tho&#x2019; without power) in her Majesty&#x2019;s Cabinet Council!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Lansdowne was in the cabinet without office.</note> Seriously, after joy at the downfall of Houndsditch Stump-oratory and dishonest merchandise of <hi rend="italic">ou&#x2019; clo&#x2019;</hi> [old clothes] (of a particular kind), such gleam of joy as beseemed every British Man, it was my first thought, Here is a Reform Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> again, pledged to &#x201C;Liberalism,&#x201C; to &#x201C;Progress&#x201C; and what not; here is a hope for us of recovering Clough from his exile! I do not know what basis there may be in such speculation; but there is no doubt your old friends do remain attached to you,&#x2014;and the road, such as it was, may be considered open again. Keep this in your eye. You have already some connexions in the Privy-Council Education line, I think;&#x2014;and there is no doubt at all but they (and we) <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to wish very much for service such as you could render if once set under way! I delivered your compliment to Lady Ashburton, as directed;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clough had sent &#x201C;kindest remembrances&#x201C; to Bath House and to Milnes.</note> and had such a response as would have well satisfied you, had you heard it. There is no falsity in that quarter at all, and much more of solidity, insight, and faithful perseverance, than a first aspect w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> indicate to every one.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clough&#x2019;s hopes of an educational Examinership in the Privy Council Office had been dashed when Lord Derby&#x2019;s Conservative govt. replaced the Liberals in <date when="1852-02-00">February</date>; but, as TC says, his same friends, Lansdowne (influenced by Matthew Arnold) and the Ashburtons, will be willing to help again. For Clough&#x2019;s letter to Lady Ashburton, <date when="1852-11-16">16 Nov.</date>, reporting his arrival in Boston and sending regards to the Carlyles, see Richard Moore, &#x201C;Arthur Hugh Clough,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">N&Q</hi> (<date when="1999-03-00">March, 1999</date>):55.</note></p>
<p>Milnes has got no place in the new Distribution;&#x2014;thousands have got none, especially Whigs; and the discontents up to this date are innumerable. They must compose themselves; for it is a law of Nature. As there is but one solar-system, and as each man (if we will consider) could eat it all, if the Fates allowed, and cram it all into his own single stomach, what chance is there of &#x201C;satisfying everybody&#x201C;? Don&#x2019;t they wish they may get it?&#x2014; A certain grim triumph, greatly preferable in comparison, rises in the heart of a man who, honestly at last, can claim of the God <hi rend="small-caps">wish</hi>, and of his ravenous fellow-bipeds of mankind&#x2014;Nothing. Which indeed is approximately possible, in certain circumstances. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Ich hab&#x2019; mein&#x2019; sach&#x2019; auf</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">nichts</hi> <hi rend="italic">gestellt</hi> / <hi rend="italic">Drum gehts mir leidlich in der welt</hi>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Juchhe, juchheisa!</hi></foreign>&#x201C;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I have renounced everything / Therefore things go well with me&#x2014;Hurrah, hurrah&#x201C; (Goethe, &#x201C;Vanitas Vanitatum Vanitas&#x201C; from the <hi rend="italic">Gesellige Lieder</hi>).</note> So sings the very blackguard (in Goethe), once he has been sufficiently beaten by the stripes of Experience. The Duke of Argyll is in the Cabinet; of which I, unlike several others that I see, am rather glad: the smallest of all the Maccallum mores,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The title &#x201C;MacCail&#xE9;in Mhor,&#x201C; or son of the great Colin, was taken for centuries by the chiefs of the Clan Campbell (of which Argyll was head), the earliest reference dating from <date when="1513-00-00">1513</date>. Scott uses the expression in <hi rend="italic">The Fair Maid of Perth</hi> (<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>).</note> in bodily stature if not otherwise, <pb id="pg-27-382" n="27:382"/>is this one; but he has a pair of stern strong blue eyes, an ingenious, ingenuous kind of face, under his red flamy head of hair; and shews a seriousness of aim, which greatly distinguishes him among those of his class. What is perhaps still more stupendous, L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> John (it is whispered) does design now to &#x201C;liberate the Jews,&#x201C;&#x2014;good Heavens, <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> we believe that the Millennium is so near! His Lordship (it appears farther) will &#x201C;go out in six weeks,&#x201C; making room for L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Clarendon,&#x2014;being in only for honour&#x2019;s sake at present (to be on a par with Palmerston, and shew himself and the world that he is so);<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As home sec., Palmerston, like Russell, was one of the three secs. of state.</note> after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he will merely &#x201C;lead the Commons,&#x201C; and visit Houndsditch with healing under his wings.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Malachi 4:2.</note>&#x2014; We have got <hi rend="italic">black</hi> dolls now, thanks to <hi rend="italic">Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin;</hi>&#x2014;however, the mania, which had become too absurd, is visibly subsiding.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After serialization in the antislavery <hi rend="italic">National Era</hi>, the novel had been pbd., 2 vols., <date when="1852-03-00">March 1852</date>; it was much reprinted in Britain where the circulation was to reach 1.5 million copies, and it was reviewed in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> as &#x201C;at every railway book-stall in England,&#x201C; in spite of including some &#x201C;absolute and audacious trash.&#x201C;</note> What next, O two-legged Herd of Gadarenes-swine,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Mark 5:1&#x2013;14.</note> with elevated tails, loud throats, and teeth dangerous to any beneficent herdsman that might interfere!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have been very low and poorly, in the black wet weather we have had, almost ever since you went away.

<p>Well, here is a bright morning to welcome you to The Grange again; and if you are a good child (as I hope), surely there is no brighter creature enjoying the heavenly sun today,&#x2014;at least none known to me, by sight, memory, or <pb id="pg-27-385" n="27:385"/>image procurable in my travels in this world hitherto!&#x2014; That is decidedly my private opinion; and I may as well state it in passing, let you make of it what you will.</p>
<p>And so my little gleam of sunshine,&#x2014;for it really was like a burst of sun, suddenly in black <date when="1852-12-00">December</date>, that piece of news A<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Russell (<sic>b. <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date></sic><corr><date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892-00-00">92</date></corr>), son of Lord George William Russell and grandson of the 6th duke of Bedford.</note> gave me that ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>,&#x2014;is suddenly gone out again, in the way we saw; and the general dark element has swallowed <hi rend="italic">it</hi> again, as so much else!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton had been ill and had spent Christmas in her room. She wrote to Jane Brookfield, <date when="1853-01-01">1 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;On the whole, I constantly say to myself, you cannot help it, you are made to have acquaintances, not friends, your lot is cast in an age where no one wants friends, where all that people want from associating with each other is given by acquaintanceship. &#x2026; Having said that and turned very uncomfortably over to the other side of one&#x2019;s mind to see if anything not so dreary could come, I there always find my dear old Prophet Carlyle, and has one any right to more than one such friend in a life time?&#x201C; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:382).</note> It was very miserable; and I could be abundantly elegiac, but will not. Let us take all things with <hi rend="italic">piety;</hi> be impatient, be disloyal about nothing that <hi rend="italic">can</hi> happen! Besides, it was in good part my own blame;&#x2014;want of talent (if you knew it), not want of goodwill: had it not been for that, I might have seen you on Monday at any rate, and my defeat had not been so total. But perhaps it will be amended yet, before the end of all things. Perhaps&#x2014;I always think there must be good lying in wait at the end of all actions and endeavours that are <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, on the part of mortal creatures; and it is my fixed orthodox creed even, that we simply get out of all things the <hi rend="italic">good</hi> (accurately measured, weighed in the <hi rend="italic">eternal</hi> balance, diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> very from our poor <hi rend="italic">temporary</hi> one!) which we ourselves have put into it: this in looking back upon my own old years, and general past life, is often solemnly made manifest to me. We will <hi rend="italic">despair</hi> of nothing.</p>
<p>Jane, I think, is writing to you today, about some affairs of a certain Maccall:&#x2014;it appears she had never yet thanked you for the illustrious Christmas Turkey, ungrateful that she was! As to Maccall, I know nothing but what you have repeatedly heard from me; and wish nothing, except that you follow the bidding of your own clear judgement and just heart, as if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> were not there at all (which indeed I properly <hi rend="italic">am not</hi>,&#x2014;remember that, I pray). The man is of ardent, high-flown, but lean and angry nature, <hi rend="italic">true</hi> as steel, and very <hi rend="italic">sharp</hi> too, but not otherwise of distinguished faculty, has also a tendency to theosophies (of a kind) and to <hi rend="italic">fanaticism</hi> in new forms; and for the rest has suffered such poverties, obstructions and contradictions as I hardly know an instance of in these modern days;&#x2014;till at last, it appears, he has gone as good as <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>, for the present; and I fear it will be difficult to achieve an effectual deliverance for him! Alas, alas&#x2014; But enough of poor Maccall.</p>

<salute>Thanks my dearest Helen&#x2014;</salute>
<p>Your packet came in on Monday morning and was just as welcome then as it would have been on Xmas day&#x2014; The little scarf does honour to Kircaldy taste&#x2014;and will suit my <hi rend="italic">scarlet waistcoat</hi> (!) charmingly&#x2014; Yes indeed my dear&#x2014;I have a waistcoat of scarlet cloth&#x2014;the same as soldiers coats are made of&#x2014;and what is stranger still I look quite&#x2014;I was going to say <hi rend="italic">beautiful</hi> but that were too <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> even for familiar correspondence&#x2014;look quite <hi rend="italic">stunning</hi> in it! and several of my friends have in consequence named me Robin-red-breast! The only Xmas remembrance I received this year besides yours&#x2014;for I dont count the Ashburton Turkey and the Redwood Welsh mutton which would come just the same if I were dead and buried, was from dear old Betty<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Braid.</note> who sent me in an old band box a large &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cak</hi>&#x201C; &#x201C;like what we made at Haddington, half a dozen mill flour <hi rend="italic">scones</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">two</hi> red cheeked apples!&#x2014;that dear soul, god bless her, will never get to think of me as anything but &#x201C;little Miss Welsh&#x201C; her &#x201C;ain <foreign>bairn</foreign>&#x201C;&#x2014;first I laughed over these things and I cried over them and ultimately I fell to eating the seedcake; the scones and apples being inapplicable to what my neighbour the Laundress next door calls &#x201C;a morbid state of the stomach&#x201C; which occasions me to protest against <hi rend="italic">her</hi> &#x201C;innocent cock&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">damn</hi> its innocence! My dear if you see in the Police reports that your cousin has been had up and is sent to Bridewell<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prison, in the City.</note> for poisoning or otherwise ridding the world of a vermin of poultry set up next door; you must just console yourself by thinking that I can &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">live down</hi> calumny&#x201C;&#x2014;Meanwhile <pb id="pg-27-387" n="27:387"/>I am going to do a little Sister-of-Charity work, to call on poor Annie Farrer who is doomed to a sofa for three or four months having broken her tendon Achilles&#x2014; Geraldine has been nearly dead of inflammation of the bowels is still very poorly&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>This is the last day of the Year; and it is <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> too, the last day of the <hi rend="italic">week</hi> on which Letters can reach you: Let me write a short word tho&#x2019; as usual &#x201C;in extreme haste&#x201C; (too usual with me here!) before going out for my daily walk.</p>
<p>Our bad weather is away now, and instead of it there is, for near a week past, weather almost miraculously beautiful for the season! Today is certainly the nicest mild sunny day one can well remember as the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> of any year. Rain tries to come on again, once or twice; but cannot: I do hope it is now gone, and will stay for some time. My <hi rend="italic">back</hi>-disorder is quite gone with it; and, sure enough, <hi rend="italic">its</hi> absence is good company. Let me hope, too, my poor Mother will get a little profit from the clearer sky; Jack rather reported less favourably than usual, last time he was down, almost a week ago. Alas, you are very weak at all times, and can stand little new weakness! But let us not complain; let us rather be thankful, and <hi rend="italic">hope.</hi> This world where we live is defined as the &#x201C;Place of Hope,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 158&#x2013;59.</note>&#x2014;and the Great all-embracing Father is around and above everyone of us,&#x2014;here and forever. Amen, amen!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are well enough in health; I getting perceptibly <hi rend="italic">clearer</hi> as I continue quiet. Hardly in my life, certainly never in London, can I recollect a more silent six weeks than these last have been: it is absolutely indispensable, for most people, especially for the like of me, so thinskinned and so confused a <pb id="pg-27-388" n="27:388"/>being, to get into perfect seclusion of mind from time to time, and to be <hi rend="italic">well let alone.</hi> The most stirring of our friends are in the country at this season; we reject all &#x201C;gaieties,&#x201C; give or take no invitations in these still weeks,&#x2014;and thus under the <hi rend="italic">veiled</hi> skies our whole existence is pretty well wrapt likewise under <hi rend="italic">veils.</hi> Better so than to catch indigestions, eating Christmas Dinners and listening to the follies of thoughtless creatures. Better always to be <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> of heart than <hi rend="italic">foolishly</hi> merry!&#x2014; I cannot get into my work yet, at least not with any completeness of energy, or openness of outlook: but one must hew away; perhaps the rocky obstructions will yield, one day, and I shall get along again, to better or worse purpose!&#x2014;</p>
<p>What is this thing that has started up at Ecclefechan, called a &#x201C;Reading-Room,&#x201C; with Lectures &#x26;c? I have seen notice of it twice in the Dumfries Newspapers;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not only did the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> of <date when="1852-12-21">21 Dec.</date> give a long report of lectures at the Annan Mechanics&#x2019; Institute, but it gave one of a new series at the Ecclefechan Reading Room on progress over the last fifty years.</note> and rubbed my eyes, saying, &#x201C;Is Saul also among the Prophets?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Sam. 10:11.</note> Is your Ecclefechan going to have itself lectured to, like the rest?&#x201C;&#x2014; Well, I will wish it may hear much <hi rend="italic">wisdom</hi> spoken to it, and that it may well attend to the same.</p>
<p>Jack told me of <hi rend="italic">young</hi> Jamie, that he had <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> him lately, and that he was doing well at Glasgow: which was very satisfactory to me. I always intend sending some word to him myself;&#x2014;but am so tossed about with occupations, it is only by <hi rend="italic">force</hi> that I can get a minute for any &#x201C;odd business&#x201C;!&#x2014; &#x2014; Our new Government is all settled now; and everybody is in hopes about it: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">new</hi> besom sweeps clean!&#x201C; Everybody may at least be <hi rend="italic">glad</hi> of the downfall of that vile imposture called &#x201C;the Derby Government,&#x201C; which has given <hi rend="italic">place</hi> to this.&#x2014; &#x2014; Alas, dear good Mother, and is this mean scraping of a letter all I can do for you? <closer><salute>God bless you evermore!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>Here is another year, God help us all! I hope it finds you better than when I last heard of you from my friends at Auchtertool I have often been meaning to write to you without waiting for a new years day but in all my life I never <pb id="pg-27-389" n="27:389"/>have been so driven off all letter writing as since the repair began in this house&#x2014;there was <hi rend="italic">four</hi> months of that confusion, which ended quite romantically in my having to sleep with loaded pistols at my bedside! the smell of paint making it as much as my life was worth to sleep with closed windows, and the thieves having become aware of the state of the premises. Once they got in and stole some six pounds worth of things before they were frightened away by a candlestick falling and making what my Irish maid called &#x201C;a devil of a row&#x201C;&#x2014;it was rather to be called <hi rend="italic">an angel of a row</hi> as it saved further deprivation. Another time they climbed up to the drawing room windows and found them fastened&#x2014;for a wonder! Another night I was alarmed by a sound as of a pane of glass cut and leapt out of bed and struck a light and listened&#x2014;and heard the same sound repeated and then a great bang like breaking in some pannel&#x2014;I took one <supplied>[of]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> my loaded pistols and went down stairs, and then another bang which I perceived was at the front door&#x2014;&#x201C;What do you want?&#x201C; I asked &#x201C;who are you?&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;it&#x2019;s the Policeman if you please&#x2014;do you know that your parlour windows are both open&#x201C;?&#x2014;it was true!&#x2014; I had forgotten to close them and the Policeman had first tried the bell which made the shudering sound the wire being detached from the bell&#x2014;and when he found he could not ring it he had beaten on the door with his stick&#x2014;the knocker also being off while it was getting painted&#x2014; I could not help laughing at what the man&#x2019;s feelings would have been had he known of the cocked pistol within a few inches of him All that sort of thing and much else more disagreeable and less amusing quite took away all my spirit for writing then when M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C returned from Germany we went to the Grange for some weeks&#x2014;then when I came home and the workmen were actually out of the house there was <pb id="pg-27-390" n="27:390"/>every thing to <hi rend="italic">look for</hi> and be put in its place and really things are hardly in their places up to this hour&#x2014; Heaven defend me from ever again having any house I live in &#x201C;made habitable&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>What beautiful weather! I was walking in the garden by moonlight last night without bonnet or shawl!&#x2014; A difference from being shut up for four months as I used to be in the winter&#x2014;</p>
<p>All is quiet in London now that we have got that weary Dukes funeral over&#x2014;for a while it made our neighbourhood perfectly intolerable I never saw streets so jammed with human beings in all my life&#x2014; I saw the <hi rend="italic">lying in state</hi>, at the cost of being crushed for <hi rend="italic">four hours</hi>&#x2014;and it was much like scenes I have seen in the Lyceum Theatre only not so well <hi rend="italic">got up</hi> as Vestris<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lucia Elizabeth (Elizabetta) Matthews, &#x201C;Madam Vestris&#x201C; (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>; <ref target="volume-27/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18331"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), actress and co-manager of the Lyceum with her husband from <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>.</note> would have had it. I also saw the procession from Bath House&#x2014;and that too displeased me&#x2014;however when the funeral car happened to stop exactly opposite to the window I was sitting at for some eight minutes&#x2014;and I saw Lord Ashburton and several others of the Dukes personal friends standing on the terrace underneath with their hats off looking on the ground very sorrowful&#x2014;and remembered that the last time I had seen the old Duke alive was in that very room, I could not help feeling as if he were pausing there to take eternal leave of us all and fell to crying and couldn&#x2019;t stop till it was all over&#x2014;</p>
<p>I send you some pictures of the thing which are quite acurate&#x2014;it may amuse you to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> what you must have read so much of in the newspapers&#x2014;And now will you give Mary and Margaret some tea or something with my blessing&#x2014;and dispose of the rest of the sovereign as you see fit&#x2014;</p>
