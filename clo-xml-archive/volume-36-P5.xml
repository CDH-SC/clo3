<p>The Duke-Edinburgh edition of <hi rend="italic">The Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi> has now reached its thirty-sixth volume, and is moving into the <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>s, the decade in which Jane Welsh Carlyle died. We began publishing the letters in <date when="1970-00-00">1970</date> with a set of four volumes covering <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">28</date>, Charles Richard Sanders having begun the project at Duke University in <date when="1952-00-00">1952</date> (see <hi rend="italic">CL</hi> 1:xxiv). In <date when="1996-00-00">1996</date>, with volume 25 reaching <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>, we changed from intermittent publication in sets of two or three volumes to an annual production of a single volume. Since then, we have continued our slow and detailed progress through the nineteenth century and the letters and lives of Thomas Carlyle (TC) and Jane Welsh Carlyle (JWC). With the launch of the Carlyle Letters Online by Duke University Press now giving online access to the edition, the volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Collected Letters</hi> truly join the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>Before considering the contents of this particular volume, it seems appropriate to look back at the aims and intentions of the edition and consider how practices may have changed over the more than fifty years the project has been in existence. It continues to be an example of international scholarly cooperation, now enabled by modern communications by email and easy transfer of electronic files. The texts of the letters of the Carlyles were mainly transcribed at Duke by Hilary Smith, our outstanding textual editor for many years, and the vast archive of typescript pages provides the basis of the textual edition, checked against originals, with only newly found letters transcribed directly into an electronic file. We are as dependent as we were in volume 1 on the skills of the production department of Duke University Press for their transformation of these typescripts into printed text. Where previously all editorial matter was also in typescript, the Press now incorporates into the print version the electronic files that make up the footnotes and front and back matter of each volume. Carlyle Letters Online has been taken from these volumes and will add each new one as it appears, as well as any material found too late to appear in the print edition. It represents a great move forward into the flexibility of electronic search engines, allowing the reader to roam by subject through the volumes and search many volumes electronically in pursuit of particular interests: individuals the Carlyles knew, themes thrown up in their day-to-day living in nineteenth-century Scotland or England, or all the details of the production of TC&#x2019;s writings.</p>
<p>C. R. Sanders&#x2019;s introduction to the first volume is a wide-ranging assessment of the purpose of the edition and of the supreme nature of the Carlyles&#x2019; <pb id="pg-36-xiv" n="36:xiv"/>letter-writing talents. He gives a summary of previous editors (including Carlyle himself), editions of the letters, and the whereabouts of the manuscripts of the letters. He lays out the details of editorial practice in relation to textual reproduction (1:xxviii&#x2014;xxix); to a large extent the current editors still follow this practice. From volume 19, a &#x201C;Note on the Text&#x201D; has been included at the beginning of the letters to explain editorial practice, with the intention of making editorial practices transparent to the reader. Have the principles of editing changed over the thirty-eight years since the publication of the first four volumes in <date when="1970-00-00">1970</date>? In many ways they have remained surprisingly constant. A decision was taken by Sanders about reproducing the texts as accurately as possible. But only an edition reproducing the manuscript form of the letters would be entirely accurate, and even that, without the feel of the paper, could not be authentic. In his <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date> review of John Wilson Croker&#x2019;s edition of Boswell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson,</hi> TC wrote about Croker&#x2019;s editing practices:</p>
<q>Nay, let us say that the spirit of Diligence, exhibited in this department, seems to attend the Editor honestly throughout: he keeps everywhere a watchful outlook on his Text; reconciling the distant with the present, or at least indicating and regretting their irreconcilability; elucidating, smoothing down; in all ways exercising, according to ability, a strict editorial superintendence. Any little Latin or even Greek phrase rendered into English, in general with perfect accuracy; citations are verified, or else corrected.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Boswell&#x2019;s Life of Johnson,&#x201D; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine,</hi> no. 28.&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.; including a Tour to the Hebrides.</hi> By James Boswell, Esq.&#x2014;A new Edition, with numerous Additions and Notes, by John Wilson Croker, LL.D., F.R.S. 5 vols. London, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 28:62).</note> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 28:64)</q>
<p>These editing principles (about a book, rather than an edition of letters) expressed at an early stage in TC&#x2019;s career have also, to an extent, illuminated the editing of the <hi rend="italic">Collected Letters</hi>. Unlike the late Victorian editions, we do not &#x201C;smooth down&#x201D; the texts of the Carlyles&#x2019; letters, preferring to print them in their complexity, mistakes and all, evoking a kind of authenticity of experience, however illusory this may seem, given the intense editorial substructure that accompanies the letters.</p>
<p>Conventions of reproduction, of addresses, salutations and farewells, the underlining of words, were established in volume 1. Punctuation is regularized up to a point while retaining as much as possible a record of what the Carlyles actually wrote. American spellings and grammatical conventions were used in the editorial matter from the beginning, and use of Modern Language Association rules of citation was formalized from volume 12. Notes have become longer and more frequent, partly because assumptions of general <pb id="pg-36-xv" n="36:xv"/>knowledge in the <date when="1960-00-00">1960</date>s can no longer be made so confidently. But also knowledge can be more accessible now; genealogical information in particular is now more easily found, meaning that many previously unidentified women, men, or children can be traced and noted. Where Shakespeare and Milton titles were always published without the author&#x2019;s name attached, now only Shakespeare has this accolade, as we reluctantly concede that Milton no longer has such a high recognition factor. An appendix of biographical notes to each volume was introduced in volume 25, at the instigation of Clyde de L. Ryals, senior editor, with K. J. Fielding, from volume 12 until his death in <date when="1998-00-00">1998</date>. These biographical notes mutate with each volume, often containing genealogical additions. Fluidity of name spelling persists in some cases, stemming from inconsistencies in nineteenth-century practice, whether by the Carlyles themselves or in listings in genealogical and other records. If JWC is our source, then a choice has to be made (as in the several servants called Ann or Anne), attempting consistency in our editorial references while accurately following changing spellings in JWC&#x2019;s letters; we do explain and gloss. TC provides a warning for all editors in his tart reaction to Croker: &#x201C;[F]or example, the Editor will punctually explain what is already sun-clear; and then anon, not without frankness, declare frequently enough that &#x2018;the Editor does not understand,&#x2019; that &#x2018;the Editor cannot guess,&#x2019; while, for the most part, the Reader cannot help both guessing and seeing&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 28:65). We try always to tread this delicate line between over- and underexplaining that TC found Croker to be transgressing.</p>
<p>The letters of this particular volume cover <date when="1859-11-00">November 1859</date> to <date when="1860-09-00">September 1860</date>; it also includes an appendix of letters to TC&#x2019;s family from summer <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>, letters that were found too late to include in volume 35; they will be included at their correct dates in Carlyle Letters Online. They refer both to the events surrounding the death of Isabella Carlyle, <date when="1859-06-00">June 1859</date>, and to the Carlyles&#x2019; summer stay in Fife. That holiday of <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date> was unusual, as it found them both in the same place for several weeks. The narrative of volume 36 is the more customary one. It begins with a winter spent together in Cheyne Row with TC working on and complaining about <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and JWC socializing, being ill (although to a lesser extent than other winters), and complaining about <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>. This is then followed by a summer apart, with the Carlyles going to different destinations and providing commentary in their letters to each other and to others on what they find at those destinations. This summer, because of JWC&#x2019;s misinterpretation of TC&#x2019;s projected plans and her precipitate return to London instead of taking a planned trip to Scotland, there is a rich seam of commentary from each on their inadequacies as correspondents. Nero the dog, JWC&#x2019;s old friend George Rennie, and Jess and Jean Donaldson, her old correspondents in Haddington, all die in <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>. The details <pb id="pg-36-xvi" n="36:xvi"/>of this eleven-month period, as always, are in the letters, and a summary can be found in the <ref target="volume-36/ed-36-chronology">chronology</ref>. From <date when="1859-11-00">November 1859</date> to <date when="1860-09-00">September 1860</date>, TC writes 125 letters to JWC&#x2019;s <date when="1887-00-00">87</date>, but many of TC&#x2019;s are short notes and JWC often writes letters of several pages, so the length of text written by JWC in this volume is nearly as much as that written by TC. Their views of the world are thus well balanced in this volume, with JWC&#x2019;s longer letters allowing for expansion of her customarily ironic take on her life, as well as expressions of grief about the loss of her dog and her old friends and of irritation with TC during their summer travels apart.</p>
<p>TC&#x2019;s first letter in this volume is appropriately about <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> to Joseph Neuberg, still faithfully pursuing books and facts for TC with booksellers and in libraries: &#x201C;I write up to the chin in detestable Imbroglios: <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it will perhaps please Heaven, in <hi rend="italic">its</hi> infinite mercy, to deliver me to all Eternity before very long!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18591101-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, [<date when="1859-11-01">1 Nov. 1859</date>]</ref>). For the next three months, TC attempts to write volume 3 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> at the same time as the printer was working on it, Neuberg correcting and researching for him as they went. In <date when="1860-01-00">January 1860</date>, TC describes the method:</p>
<q>[H]ere has the Printer made his appearance; and he is eager to be at work! &#x2F; I can see nothing for it but that after <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> carefully some 10 or 12 of the first leaves (and making your jottings about them) you give them up to Robson; taking the rest more at leisure,&#x2014;for he will not be in a very great hurry of speed; and is certain to waste a few days at the very first, in making adjustments, and settling preliminaries. &#x2F; I shall not <hi rend="italic">correct</hi> anything till I see the whole Book in slips;&#x2014;if you could get y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> leaves <hi rend="italic">back</hi> from Robson for me, in a printed state; and let me have the whole (with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> remarks) on Sunday night next, that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the utmost I could expect, and indeed w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do well enough. (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600116-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1860-01-16">16 Jan. 1860</date></ref>)</q>
<p>By <date when="1860-02-00">February</date>, TC has called a halt to this frantic method, describing this to Lord Ashburton in imagery of the Crimean War:</p>
<q>I myself am rather below par,&#x2014;and very greatly bothered and hunted by this sad Book of mine; which, like the Siege of Sebastopol to Sir J<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Burgoyne, seems always the more impossible the longer one gazes on it! I attempted lately to do it by <hi rend="italic">coup de main</hi> (or continuous storm, to last for 12 months!)&#x2014;that is to say, I set the Printers to work to <hi rend="italic">chace</hi> me thro&#x2019; it at a slow rate;&#x2014;but have been obliged to call Halt in that, and go back to my trenches with heavy loss! (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600204-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1860-02-04">4 Feb. 1860</date></ref>)</q>
<p>In the headnotes that TC wrote later to JWC&#x2019;s letters of this time, he remembers that he stopped at JWC&#x2019;s insistence: &#x201C;This first attempt of <date when="1859-10-00">October</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-02-00">February, 1859</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date> (after dreadful tugging at the straps), was given up by her serious advices, which I could not but admit to be true as well as painful <pb id="pg-36-xvii" n="36:xvii"/>and humiliating!&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:18). No hint of this appears in the letters, although JWC comments to TC&#x2019;s sister Mary Austin that her better health this winter had helped &#x201C;to keep up my heart in this weary passage thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">The Valley of the Shadow of Frederick the Great!</hi>&#x2014; Whom I am as sick of as I ever was of any thing in this world. And his unlucky Biographer, would, I dare say, tell the same story&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600216-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to MCA, [ca. <date when="1860-02-16">16 Feb. 1860</date>]</ref>). She had clearly also complained to Thomas Erskine, as he defends TC in his reply: &#x201C;So the valley of the shadow of Frederick gets sometimes a little dark &#x26; rough! &#x2026; I have no doubt it will pay the world for the trouble which it costs its author&#x201D; (Thomas Erskine to JWC, <date when="1860-02-06">6 Feb. [1860]</date>). It is clear that JWC is more concerned with its toll on herself than with the rewards the world was going to get from another work by Thomas Carlyle.</p>
<p>TC continues to struggle with volume 3 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, using both Henry Larkin and Neuberg as researchers. On <date when="1860-05-16">16 May 1860</date> he writes to Larkin asking for Friedrich books, while also acknowledging the importance to him of Larkin&#x2019;s &#x201C;right trade, that of the Maps&#x201D; (for Larkin&#x2019;s previous work on maps for <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570815-TC-JAC-01"><sic>33:28</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1857-08-15">15 Aug. 1857</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580719-JWC-TC-01"><sic>34:57</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1858-07-19">19 July 1858</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590208-TC-HL-01"><sic>35:26</sic><corr>TC to HL, <date when="1859-02-08">8 Feb. 1859</date></corr></ref>). On the same day, he also writes to Neuberg: &#x201C;I have a bit of partly simple, partly very abstruse <hi rend="italic">Copying</hi> for you here &#x2026; in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> if you can succeed, as you have sometimes done, there will be a bit of real service rendered.&#x201D; On <date when="1859-06-07">7 June</date>, he again writes notes to both of them with requests for help, illustrating the complementary use that he makes of their willingness to help. His own feelings about <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> continue to be negative; he describes the book as &#x201C;a most undoable problem &#x2026; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have got chained to, for my sins. Never in my life did there turn up for me so intolerable a burden as this wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I look upon as the finale. Certainly either it must finish, or else I!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600524-TC-SGS-01">TC to <sic>[Sir GS or UC]</sic><corr>[SGS]</corr>, <date when="1860-05-24">24 May 1860</date></ref>). In <date when="1860-08-00">August</date>, while in Thurso and struggling with positioning material he had already written, he returns to his military imagery about the writing of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and comments: &#x201C;This week has gone well with me, in all points except the Friedrich-Book one (sorrow on it!) Work w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not go on at all in the new section: however, I took it in the flank today, and did get some small way made again. A considerable comfort,&#x2014;in this wettest of days&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600824-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-08-24">24 Aug. 1860</date></ref>). By the end of this volume of the <hi rend="italic">Collected Letters</hi> there is little real sense of progress. Volumes 3 and 4 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> were not published until <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date> and <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>, with JWC&#x2019;s attitude remaining unchanged. Only after her death does TC articulate recognition of her forbearance in his exaggerated later commentary on <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600128-JWC-MR-01">JWC&#x2019;s letter to <sic>Mary Russell</sic><corr>[MR]</corr>, <date when="1860-01-28">28 January 1860</date></ref>:</p>
<q>My darling must have suffered much in all this; how much! I sometimes thought how cruel it was on her, to whom &#x2018;Frederick&#x2019; was literally nothing except through me, so cruel, alas, alas, and yet inevitable! Never once in her deepest misery did she hint, by word or sign, what she too <pb id="pg-36-xviii" n="36:xviii"/>was suffering under that score; me only did she ever seem to pity in it, the heroic, the thrice noble, and wholly loving soul!&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s headnote in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:18)</q>
<p>It seems surprising if JWC did not even &#x201C;hint&#x201D; that &#x201C;she too was suffering&#x201D; to TC, given the extent to which she writes about her feelings in her letters to others.</p>
<p>Many of the letters of the second half of this volume are the usual summer exchange between TC and JWC while on their respective travels. JWC describes herself to TC&#x2019;s sister Mary as now having &#x201C;time to <hi rend="italic">listen</hi> to my own sufferings, which had been drowned in the eloquence of <hi rend="italic">his!</hi>&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600823-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to MCA, [<date when="1860-08-23">23 Aug. 1860</date>]</ref>). Since TC spends six weeks in Thurso in the north of Scotland while JWC stays in Chelsea, visits Alderley, and then returns to London, the extended length of time that the postal services take in their exchange of letters allows for much misunderstanding and irritation between the two. TC feels himself entirely innocent when JWC misinterprets a letter about his plans and rushes back to London instead of traveling on to Dumfriesshire. JWC is furious with TC and punishes him by making her feelings clear (as well as describing them to her other correspondents): &#x201C;As for your indignations at my not writing&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t quarrel with <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x2014;only beg to remind you that the reciprocity is not all on one side!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600903-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1860-09-03">3 Sept. 1860</date></ref>]). He had already written to his brother John that her movements are &#x201C;a provoking enigma to me&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600829-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1860-08-29">29 Aug. 1860</date></ref>), and he defends himself vigorously to JWC:</p>
<q><hi rend="italic">[A] postal burble;</hi> the obstinate refusal, on the part of the female mind, to recognise as facts the unalterable laws of time and distance, and loyally conform to them in epistolary procedure. Your interpretations and hypotheses about <hi rend="italic">my</hi> neglect of writing to you &#x26;c are as distracted as ever;&#x2014;but I forget all that, nor will recognise any sin in you, you perverse creature, now that I hear at last that you are not in worse health than usual! &#x2026; Adieu dear <hi rend="italic">Anti-Geometress</hi> of Goodies. (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600905-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-09-05">5 Sept. 1860</date></ref>)</q>
<p>He writes to John the next day that she has &#x201C;at last written: Nothing the matter, after all my alarms; considers herself the aggrieved party, good soul, obstinately ignoring the inexorable regulations of mail-time in this country!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600906-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1860-09-06">6 Sept. 1860</date></ref>). JWC provides a forthright analysis of TC&#x2019;s failure of tone and of understanding:</p>
<q>Not one letter you have written to me since you went away has hit the right state of things! Do the best that ever you could!&#x2014;your &#x201C;sheeps head&#x201D; and your &#x201C;coffin&#x201D; have been equally out of time! Such being, I suppose, the natural result of going where an answer to ones letters <pb id="pg-36-xix" n="36:xix"/>cannot be received in less than six days&#x2014;in a world where nothing keeps still. &#x2026; For the rest; all that has been said and written about my turning back and about my not starting again is kindly meant; but being said or written in total ignorance of the subject, quite over-shoots or under-shoots the mark! (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600909-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1860-09-09">9 Sept. 1860</date>]</ref>)</q>
<p>After this critique of TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;total ignorance,&#x201D; both Carlyles draw back, and the tone of their letters until TC returns to Chelsea at the end of the month is noticeably kinder. What is unusual in this exchange of letters is the extent to which they each comment (quite critically) on the other to relatives and friends and each feel aggrieved and justified in their position, providing an open and equal expression of feelings between them.</p>
<p>The survival of many letters to the Carlyles means that we have a fund of material at our disposal that can both explain a particular letter and expand on our understanding of a particular area. <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600128-JWC-MR-01">JWC&#x2019;s letter to <sic>Mary Russell</sic><corr>[MR]</corr>, <date when="1860-01-28">28 January 1860</date></ref>, contains references to Isabelle Duncan&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Pre-Adamite Man; Or, The Story of Our Old Planet and Its Inhabitants, told by Scripture &#x26; Science,</hi> published anonymously in <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date> with five further editions to <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>, when she finally puts her name to it. JWC couples Duncan&#x2019;s less well-known work with Darwin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">On the Origin of Species,</hi> published in <date when="1859-11-00">November 1859</date>:</p>
<p>But even when Darwin, in a Book that all the scientific world is in ecstasy over, <hi rend="italic">proved</hi> the other day, that we are all come from shell-fish! it didn&#x2019;t move me to the slightest curiosity whether we are or not! I did not feel that the slightest light would be thrown on my practical life for me by having it ever so logically made out, that my first ancestor millions of millions of ages back had been or even had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been an oyster!&#x2014; It remained a plain fact that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was no oyster! nor had no grandfather oyster within my knowledge and for the rest, there was nothing to be gained for this world or the next by going into the oyster-question till all more pressing questions were exhausted! So&#x2014;if I can&#x2019;t read Darwin&#x2014;! it may be feared I shall break down in M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Duncan! (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600128-JWC-MR-01">JWC to <sic>Mary Russell</sic><corr>[MR]</corr>, [<date when="1860-01-28">28 Jan. 1860</date>]</ref>)</p>
<p>Any reference to oysters is untraceable in <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species,</hi> although Darwin did write that since early forms of marine creatures &#x201C;have transmitted modified descendants to the present day &#x2026; . [t]hey may metaphorically be called cousins to the &#x2026; millionth degree&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> [<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>] 420&#x2013;21). A possible source for JWC&#x2019;s extension of the descent from shellfish to oysters can be traced to Edward Twisleton&#x2019;s letter to TC from Malvern, <date when="1860-01-01">1 January 1860</date>; here Twisleton calls <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species</hi> &#x201C;the most remarkable and original work in its line&#x201D; and then reports that his wife has been ordered &#x201C;to lead the life of her <pb id="pg-36-xx" n="36:xx"/>hundredth million million, million, million Cousin, the Oyster&#x201D; so as not to injure her health &#x201C;by an intemperate use of [her] brains.&#x201D; Ellen Twisleton was being treated by Dr. James Gully (who had also treated Darwin and the Carlyles), and the entertaining possibility exists that the identification of our &#x201C;cousins to the &#x2026; millionth degree&#x201D; with oysters might have been suggested by Darwin himself in conversation with Gully. What is certain is that the use of oysters as ancestors in reviews was used by reviewers in <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>, but not in any <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date> review that we have found. TC&#x2019;s copy of <hi rend="italic">On the Origin of Species</hi> in the National Library of Scotland contains no marginalia. Since TC was a frequent commentator in the margins of his books (for his comments in the margins of Ruskin&#x2019;s copy of Barrett Browning&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh,</hi> see <ref target="volume-32/ed-32-comments-on-aurora-leigh"><sic>33:224&#x2013;42</sic></ref>; for his marginalia on <hi rend="italic">Historical Memoirs of His Late Royal Highness William-Augustus, Duke of Cumberland</hi> [<date when="1767-00-00">1767</date>], see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590505-TC-SLA-01"><sic>35:87</sic><corr>TC to SLA, <date when="1859-05-05">5 May, 1859</date></corr></ref>), the inference has to be that he did not read Darwin&#x2019;s book.</p>
<p>The letters provide some sharp details about the specifics of the Carlyles&#x2019; lives. Much has been written of TC&#x2019;s concentration on the troubles of his digestion; in this volume his instructions to Sir George Sinclair before his trip to Thurso provide an illustration of his dietary habits that is based on an assertion of peasant simplicity:</p>
<q>[M]y domestic habits are all for simplicity and composure (<hi rend="italic">simplex munditiis</hi> the motto in all things), that I live, with clear preference where possible, on rustic farm-produce,&#x2014; &#x201C;milk and meal,&#x201D; eggs, chickens, moor-mutton; white fish (salmon, veal, lamb, three things tabooed to me); reckon an innocent bread-pudding the very acme of culinary art &#x2026; &#x201C;the Cow is the friend of man, and the French cook his enemy,&#x201D; and not one day in ten drink beyond a single glass of wine. (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600724-TC-SGS-01">TC to <sic>Sir GS</sic><corr>[SGS]</corr>, <date when="1860-07-24">24 July 1860</date></ref>)</q>
<p>But he also provides a dramatic image (appropriately to Thackeray, a fellow writer aware of the effectiveness of exaggeration) to underline the relationship between his state of mind and his capacity for particular foods: &#x201C;Alas, dear Thackeray, I durst as soon undertake to dance a hornpipe on the top of Bond Steeple, as to eat white-bait dinner in my present low and lost state!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600524-TC-WMT-01">TC to WMT, <date when="1860-05-24">24 May 1860</date></ref>). We are given the most specific detail on JWC&#x2019;s clothing when she makes a jacket for herself in <date when="1860-01-00">January 1860</date> and then describes and illustrates its trimming in detail to Mary Russell: &#x201C;The one I made of black silk is corded all round with scarlet-silk and then, about half an inch from the edge, a tartan velvet ribbon is run on plain&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600224-JWC-MR-01">JWC to <sic>Mary Russell</sic><corr>[MR]</corr>, <date when="1860-02-24">24 Feb. 1860</date></ref><sic>; for the drawings, see 76</sic>). In this volume the Carlyles each develop a new relationship with Lady Louisa Ashburton, Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s second wife, and JWC expresses extraordinary enthusiasm for the Ashburton baby (<ref target="volume-36/lt-18600711-JWC-LLA-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1860-07-11">11 July 1860</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600816-JWC-LST-01">JWC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LST</corr>, [ca. <date when="1860-08-16">16 Aug. 1860</date>]</ref>). <pb id="pg-36-xxi" n="36:xxi"/>TC extends his own aristocratic contacts with his long stay in Thurso with Sir George Sinclair, son of the great statistician Sir John Sinclair. And, as always, there is evidence in this volume of TC&#x2019;s affectionate generosity to his family.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, further evidence appears of letters that JWC wrote but which have been lost. We know that JWC tried to write weekly (on a Wednesday) to the Donaldson sisters in Haddington (see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571008-JWC-MR-01"><sic>33:99</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1857-10-08">8 Oct. 1857</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600331-JWC-GDI-01">JWC to <sic>Grace Dinning</sic><corr>GDI</corr>, [<date when="1860-03-31">31 March 1860</date>]</ref>) but very few of the letters survive. In this volume we have JWC&#x2019;s last letter to Jess Donaldson, <date when="1860-06-02">2 June 1860</date>, in fact written after Jess died, <date when="1860-06-01">1 June</date>. This death and the death of her sister Jean, <date when="1860-03-30">30 March</date>, severed another link with Haddington for JWC. JWC also apparently wrote, late <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>, to Samuel Smiles (inextricably linked for us with notions of Victorian thrift and duty), as Smiles writes two letters to JWC in <date when="1859-12-00">December 1859</date>. These came out of links of friendship rooted in Haddington, Smiles writing in his second letter: &#x201C;My Dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle &#x2F; I am glad to find that my note has brought up in your mind so many associations of delightful girlhood.&#x201D; Smiles continues that it was &#x201C;positively the first time in which I was ever regarded in the light of a small lion. But a Haddington animal of this sort, even of the very smallest, is such a rarity, that I feel it is possible to be a curiosity, &#x26; at the same time a very ordinary creature after all&#x201D; (S. Smiles to JWC, <date when="1859-12-13">13 Dec. 1859</date>). JWC does not mention Smiles in her letters, but, as is our customary practice, we provide quotations from them by attaching them to the nearest dated letter, thus allowing us to illustrate the widespread connections of JWC as well as TC.</p>
   <p>Liz Stanley writes in <date when="2004-00-00">2004</date> that &#x201C;until relatively recently letters have been used mainly as a resource and treated as referential of a person&#x2019;s life and its historical and relational context, with the focus on content and its recording of factual information.&#x201D; She then suggests that there has been a move &#x201C;over the last two decades or so&#x201D; to an &#x201C;emphasis &#x2026; on the performative, textual and rhetorical aspects of letters.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Liz Stanley, &#x201C;The Epistolarium: On Theorizing Letters and Correspondences,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Auto&#x2F; Biography</hi> 12 (<date when="2004-00-00">2004</date>): 201&#x2013;35 (quotations on 211).</note> But awareness of the value of the Carlyles&#x2019; letters in these terms existed from much earlier than the last two decades of the twentieth century. JWC&#x2019;s letters were always appreciated as performative and rhetorical; however much JWC&#x2019;s and TC&#x2019;s biographers were to use them as source material for the lives, their literary qualities were recognized, ensuring that from the first publication of her letters in <date when="1883-00-00">1883</date> there was recognition that there were &#x201C;two writers in the house&#x201D; (as Townsend Scudder put it in <date when="1931-00-00">1931</date>).<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Townsend Scudder, <hi rend="italic">Letters of Jane Welsh Carlyle to Joseph Neuberg, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date></hi> (<date when="1931-00-00">1931</date>) xiii.</note> C. R. Sanders&#x2019;s final section of the <ref target="volume-01/ed-01-introduction">introduction to volume 1</ref> considers the &#x201C;Characteristics, Value, and Significance of the Letters&#x201D; (1:xxx&#x2013;xliv).<pb id="pg-36-xxii" n="36:xxii"/> This remains a model of analysis as to why the Carlyles&#x2019; letters should be published and the ways in which they can be approached as literature, discussing the skill of both Carlyles in narrative, description, and portraiture. Inevitably, as a senior male academic of that time, Sanders concentrates on TC&#x2019;s responses to the world around him. But, having taken the decision that both sets of letters had to be published together, because JWC&#x2019;s &#x201C;letters were essentially and vitally complementary to his&#x201D; (1:xxvi), Sanders provides a brief description of JWC&#x2019;s high literary skills: &#x201C;Her resources of language were remarkable, involving abundant use of metaphor and great variety and cleverness in making use of the principle of association&#x201D; (1:xxxi). Sanders also highlights TC&#x2019;s own view of the editor&#x2019;s craft, summarizing TC&#x2019;s response to Oliver Cromwell, John Sterling, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Sir Walter Scott, Horace Walpole, and Voltaire (1:xi&#x2014;xv), implicitly underlining the possibility of letters as literature, rather than as just biographical or historical source material. Sanders&#x2019;s conclusion underlines this view: &#x201C;Taken as a whole, the letters have a vital unity and unfold a story resembling that of an enormous multi-volumed, crowded-canvas, cross-section-of-life, realistic novel, swarming with major and minor characters, containing much dialogue, and having a moving and complex plot with subplots and auxiliary anecdotes, and with many bright comic colors providing relief for some deeply tragic shadows&#x201D; (1:xliii&#x2014;iv). K. J. Fielding, the senior editor with the project from the mid-<date when="1960-00-00">1960</date>s until <date when="2001-00-00">2001</date>, never wavered in his long commitment to the Carlyles&#x2019; letters. Yet in <date when="1987-00-00">1987</date> he felt obliged to show a more defensive attitude to the genre of &#x201C;Letters &#x201C;: &#x201C;Letters in general have been losing their status as literature or even part of the biographical record, perhaps because though highly expressive their context makes them resistant to reinterpretation&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-01/ed-13-introduction"><sic>13:xiii</sic><corr>13:introduction</corr></ref>). This response was perhaps inevitable at a time more devoted to theory in the study of literature than to scholarly editions of &#x201C;great&#x201D; writers&#x2019; letters. But with the return of the appreciation of letters as a literary form and a new understanding of the importance of life writing and testimony, the success, interest, and usefulness of a great scholarly edition of letters can be asserted without apology.</p>

TC sends James Liddell a gift of books (<date when="1859-11-10">10</date>), thanking him for allowing him and JWC the free use of Auchtertool House in <date when="1859-00-00">August</date>. TC consults with Edward Chapman about prints of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> (<date when="1859-11-11">11</date>) and asks Jean Aitken to knit him &#x201C;sock boots&#x201D; for riding (<date when="1859-11-13">13</date>). He writes James Marshall to acknowledge the grand duke of Weimar&#x2019;s intention of conferring on him the title of Knight of the White Falcon (<date when="1859-11-14">14</date>). He recommends his neighbor Gilchrist&#x2019;s biography of Blake to Edward Chapman (<date when="1859-11-28">28</date>). JWC congratulates Lady Airlie on the birth of her daughter, and confesses her apprehension about visiting The Grange under the new Lady Ashburton, who is also expecting a child ([<date when="1859-11-28">28 Nov.</date> or <date when="1859-12-05">5 Dec.</date>]). JWC&#x2019;s dog, Nero, is now confined to the house after being run over by a butcher&#x2019;s cart in <date when="1859-10-00">October</date>. TC welcomes the resumption of correspondence with Edward FitzGerald (<date when="1859-11-30">30</date>). JWC writes to William Dods about Haddington news and tells him of a visit from her old admirer George Rennie ([<date when="1859-11-30">>30</date>]).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1859-12-00">December</date>.</hi> TC&#x2019;s title Knight of the White Falcon is announced in the newspapers (<date when="1859-12-06">6</date>); he gives the insignia to JWC. Nero&#x2019;s asthma is worse. John Carlyle is looking for a house to buy (<date when="1859-12-10">10</date> [<date when="1859-12-11">11</date>]). TC has a cold, toothache, and &#x201C;an ugly fixed pain in the brow&#x201D; ([<date when="1859-12-15">15</date>]). The Carlyles spend Christmas in Chelsea. TC continues to struggle with his work (<date when="1859-12-29">29</date>). JWC sends a rubber hot water bottle to Janet Davidson, who has evidently been ill; JWC&#x2019;s letters to Scotland for <date when="1860-01-01">New Year&#x2019;s Day</date> are delayed by visitors, but are written ([<date when="1859-12-31">31</date>]).</p>
<p><date when="1860-01-00"><bold>1860</bold> <hi rend="italic">January</hi></date><hi rend="italic">.</hi> TC sends New Year&#x2019;s gifts to his relatives (<date when="1860-01-02">2</date>). JWC goes shopping for new clothes (<date when="1860-01-02">2</date>) for the Carlyles&#x2019; visit to The Grange (<date when="1860-01-05">5</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-01-13">13</date>). TC calls on Lady Sandwich (<date when="1860-01-03">3</date>) and gives Neuberg work to do in his absence (<date when="1860-01-04">4</date>) and (<date when="1860-01-007">7</date>). JWC&#x2019;s health improves at The Grange, but she worries about Nero ([<date when="1860-01-10">10</date>]), while TC tells sister Jean that he was &#x201C;decidedly wretched&#x201D; at first but felt better by the end of the visit (<date when="1860-01-14">14</date>). John A. Carlyle exercises TC&#x2019;s horse, Fritz, while TC is away (<date when="1860-01-14">14</date>); JWC sends a pheasant to Isabella Barnes, an unwanted gift from The Grange ([<date when="1860-01-14">14</date>]). TC&#x2019;s printers begin work on vol. 3 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1860-01-16">16</date>) but TC stops sending them work by the beginning of <date when="1860-02-00">February</date>; the printers do not resume until <date when="1860-11-00">November</date>. Eggs, fowls, and cakes arrive from Scotland. JWC describes the second Lady Ashburton as &#x201C;kindness&#x2019;s self&#x201D; ([<date when="1860-01-16">16</date>]). Larkin and Neuberg are still helping TC with small commissions, while TC is &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">busy</hi> almost to <hi rend="italic">delirium</hi>&#x201D; (<date when="1860-01-24">24</date>).</p>
<p><pb id="pg-36-xxxii" n="36:xxxii"/><hi rend="italic"><date when="1860-02-00">February</date>.</hi> JWC is devastated by the death of Nero, &#x201C;my inseparable Companion during eleven years&#x201D; (<date when="1860-02-01">1</date>); she asks Robert Tait for copies of some of his photographs of Nero ([<date when="1860-02-06">6</date>]). Prompted by Lord Ashburton ([<date when="1860-02-02">2</date>]), TC returns W. V. Vernon&#x2019;s Francke portrait of Frederick (<date when="1860-02-11">11</date>). JWC writes the Dods about Charlotte&#x2019;s valentine card, and of her own delight in receiving a photograph of them (<date when="1860-02-15">15</date>); TC also had a valentine gift from a female admirer ([<date when="1860-02-16">16</date>]). <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> is proceeding slowly; TC complains that he is &#x201C;in the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">Slough</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Despond</hi>&#x201D; (<date when="1860-02-20">20</date>). JWC advises Mary Russell on dressmaking (<date when="1860-02-24">24</date>). TC declines an invitation to Vernon Lushington&#x2019;s birthday party (<date when="1860-02-26">26</date>) and thanks Charles Butler for his help with American investments (<date when="1860-02-28">28</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1860-03-00">March</date>.</hi> Ruskin had already lent TC a copy of one D&#xfc;rer print and now lends him another (<date when="1860-03-15">15</date>); TC remains very busy with his &#x201C;unprofitable, hideously undoable task&#x201D; (<date when="1860-03-27">27</date>). JWC sits with George Rennie as he dies (<date when="1860-03-22">22</date>) and writes to tell his Aunt Grace about the death (<date when="1860-03-23">23</date>). Jean Donaldson dies (<date when="1860-03-30">30</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1860-04-00">April</date>.</hi> TC and JWC are given a private viewing of Holman Hunt&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple,</hi> which TC calls &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">really grand</hi> Picture&#x201D; (<date when="1860-04-13">13</date>). TC, having bought the stereotype plates of his works, derives a steady income from their use for reprint editions; he sends &#xa3;50 to his brother Alick in Canada (<date when="1860-04-13">13</date>) and offers to help Alick&#x2019;s son Tom if necessary. He visits Lord Sandwich and, his mother, Lady Sandwich, at Hinchinbrook (<date when="1860-04-26">26</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-04-28">28</date>), though he finds the company too stimulating (<date when="1860-04-27">27</date>). He sends &#xa3;10 to his sister Jenny in Canada (<date when="1860-04-30">30</date>). He corresponds with Emerson about American and German editions of his works (<date when="1860-04-30">30</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1860-05-00">May</date>.</hi> JWC has a fall and breaks a rib, but asks Jane Dods whether she should visit the gravely ill Jess Donaldson in Haddington ([<date when="1860-05-09">9</date>]); she is convinced by Jane Dods&#x2019;s reply that she should not go ([<date when="1860-05-17">17</date>]). TC refuses to write on the proposed Reform Bill for Thomas Ballantyne&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Manchester Review</hi> (<date when="1860-05-09">9</date>). Neuberg and Larkin continue working steadily for TC. He loses patience with the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> and changes to the <hi rend="italic">Observer</hi> (<date when="1860-05-16">16</date>); his impatience with <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> means &#x201C;certainly either it must finish, or else I!&#x201D; (<date when="1860-05-24">24</date>). He sends his brother James the final payment for the refurbishment of the family plot in Ecclefechan graveyard (<date when="1860-05-23">23</date>). He accepts an invitation from Sir William Payne-Gallwey to visit Chequers (<date when="1860-05-26">26</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-05-28">28</date>). Thackeray asks TC for an article for the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill,</hi> but TC refuses (<date when="1860-05-26">26</date>). JWC is recovering from her accident (<date when="1860-05-30">30</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1860-06-00">June</date>.</hi> JWC writes affectionately to Jess Donaldson, not having heard of her death on <date when="1860-06-01">1 June</date>; she hears of the death of her childhood friend Robert McTurk in Dumfriesshire ([<date when="1860-06-02">2</date>]). TC thanks Lady Payne-Gallwey for photographs of the Cromwells from Chequers (<date when="1860-06-05">5</date>). He complains of sleeplessness and of heavy summer rain (<date when="1860-06-07">7</date>). JWC thanks Lady Ashburton for a kind letter, <pb id="pg-36-xxxiii" n="36:xxxiii"/>asks her for copies of some photographs, and comments on the strain TC is under with <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1860-06-16">16</date>). She plans an expedition to Southend with Neuberg (<date when="1860-06-22">22</date>). She congratulates Lady Ashburton on the birth (<date when="1860-06-26">26</date>) of her daughter, Mary Florence ([<date when="1860-06-29">29</date>]).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1860-07-00">July</date>.</hi> JWC visits the Ashburton baby (<date when="1860-07-13">13</date>). The Carlyles and Neuberg go to Brighton for a week (<date when="1860-07-02">2</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-07-09">9</date>), but TC still has trouble sleeping. They visit Kate Ross, who is ill. JWC continues in good health and visits Lady Ashburton (<date when="1860-07-13">13</date>). TC accepts an invitation to visit Sir George Sinclair in Thurso (<date when="1860-07-24">24</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1860-08-00">August</date>.</hi> Charlotte Southam is dismissed and &#x201C;Old Jane&#x201D; employed (<date when="1860-08-00">early Aug.</date>). TC, feeling generally run down, embarks with his brother John for Aberdeen (<date when="1860-08-01">1</date>) and then to Sir George Sinclair in Thurso Castle (<date when="1860-08-04">4</date>), leaving behind JWC, who prefers to remain in Chelsea. She visits Kate Ross, who is in lodgings in London (<date when="1860-08-04">4</date>), and embarks on general cleaning and repairs at Cheyne Row. She thanks Lady Stanley for the gift of her portrait; William and Jane Dods visit (8) as do Andrew and Mary Symington (11). JWC&#x2019;s nerves are still bad, and she sleeps little. In Thurso TC writes, walks, bathes, and relaxes; he sends Lady Sandwich a groatie buckie and a twig of heather (<date when="1860-08-12">12</date>). TC, hearing of JWC&#x2019;s ill health, advises her to leave London for the country (<date when="1860-08-13">13</date>), specifically to Mary Austin at The Gill. JWC accepts Lady Stanley&#x2019;s invitation to Alderley and makes plans to travel on to Scotland from there. Before leaving London she visits Lady Sandwich ([<date when="1860-08-17">17</date>]) and is visited by Lady Ashburton (<date when="1860-08-00">21</date>). TC and Sir George visit John o&#x2019; Groats (<date when="1860-08-22">22</date>); TC&#x2019;s sleep has greatly improved, but he finds family visitors to Thurso Castle (especially grandchildren) trying. Having finished book 3 of vol. 3 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1860-08-22">22</date> [<date when="1860-08-21">21</date>]), he plans to leave Thurso and travel to Annandale via Linlathen (<date when="1860-08-24">24</date> [<date when="1860-08-23">23</date>]). JWC goes to Alderley (<date when="1860-08-22">22</date>) and writes to Mary Austin and Mary Russell, arranging to visit them; she misinterprets TC&#x2019;s confusing letter (<date when="1860-08-22">22</date> [<date when="1860-08-21">21</date>]) as meaning he is leaving for Chelsea at once; JWC decides she should give up her own travel plans and return to prepare the house for his return. TC writes to say she has misunderstood him (<date when="1860-08-28">28</date>), too late to prevent her return (<date when="1860-08-28">28</date>). She asks William Dods to tell her who has bought Sunny Bank (Tenterfield) in Haddington. Charlotte Southam is taken back for occasional days, &#x201C;Old Jane&#x201D; proving incompetent.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1860-09-00">September</date>.</hi> TC, still in Thurso, writes to Lady Sandwich telling her the legend of John o&#x2019; Groat, and to Lady Ashburton regretting that he cannot come and visit them at Kinlochluichart (<date when="1860-09-02">2</date>). He plans to recommence the printing of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1860-09-07">7</date>). Neuberg invites JWC to Margate for an excursion, but she declines ([<date when="1860-09-03">3</date>]). She goes to Norwood with Geraldine Jewsbury for the day (<date when="1860-09-07">7</date>), after which she becomes ill; she is visited in her sickroom by Countess von Usedom (<date when="1860-09-08">8</date>). The servant &#x201C;Old Jane&#x201D; is dismissed, and &#x201C;Tall Charlotte&#x201D; <pb id="pg-36-xxxiv" n="36:xxxiv"/>employed. TC leaves Thurso (<date when="1860-09-07">7</date>) and stays with Erskine at Linlathen (<date when="1860-09-08">8</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-09-11">11</date>), then takes the train to Scotsbrig (<date when="1860-09-11">11</date>). JWC recovers sufficiently to go out for a drive to Bath House ([<date when="1860-09-12">12</date>]). TC finds Scotsbrig lonely and is irritable. He moves to The Gill, where a family reunion takes place (<date when="1860-09-16">16</date>). He visits Dumfries, climbs the Mid-Steeple, and sees the old townhouse originally belonging to JWC&#x2019;s family. JWC is bedridden with influenza for several days. A second servant, Sarah, arrives (<date when="1860-09-18">18</date>). Mrs. Wedgwood visits bringing grapes (<date when="1860-09-18">18</date>), and JWC recovers enough to invite John Barlow to tea (<date when="1860-09-20">20</date>). TC returns to Chelsea, declining a visit to Alderley en route (<date when="1860-09-22">22</date>). He thanks Charles Ward for his poem &#x201C;A Sutherland Clearance&#x201D; (<date when="1860-09-24">24</date>) and summons Neuberg (who is away) to start work again on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1860-09-28">28</date>).</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The other day I did myself the pleasure of despatching (to the care of Menzies Bookseller, Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Menzies (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>;<ref target="volume-36/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39017"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), wholesale bookseller and publisher of Scottish guidebooks; he opened his first railway bookstall in <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>. His warehouse premises were at 2 S. Hanover St., Edinburgh.</note> a Packet of Books for Auchtertool,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Liddell lent the Carlyles Auchtertool House (next to Auchtertool Manse) rent-free from <date when="1859-08-06">6 Aug.</date> until <date when="1859-09-10">10 Sept.</date></note> which have probably arrived, or ought to be arriving, about this date. I cannot hope they will be of much use to you, nor are you bound to look <hi rend="italic">into</hi> them at all; but I must beg you to accept them, and give them houseroom, as a small memorial of my sentiment upon your very great civilities to us in Fife last summer; a kindness and politeness on your part, which it will be long before we be tempted to forget!</p>
<p>I was unluckily so driven, at the time of my departure, that I had to go on the sudden, and leave to my Wife the charge of bidding you individually farewell at the time.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For JWC&#x2019;s relief at TC&#x2019;s departure, see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590918-JWC-LST-01"><sic>35:207</sic><corr>JWC to LST, <date when="1859-09-18">18 Sept.</date></corr></ref></note> But there will be other seasons, I hope, for repairing that omission. And repaired or not, you will know to interpret it, not too deeply to my discredit. Auchtertool, it is very certain, will continue pleasantly memorable to me all my days, for your sake, were there no other&#x2019;s.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>In regard to the Two Berlin Proof Prints, which I have had in hand these five days, and have been considering with best attention, my report is this:</p>
<p>1<hi rend="italic">&#xB0;</hi>. As to the First Print, the <hi rend="italic">Younger</hi> Friedrich, I pronounce it at once to be of first-rate excellence, almost as good as Wille&#x2019;s original; and think we have nothing to do but accept that, as in all respects the thing wanted. If the Berlin friends could add (from indubitable authority, Herr Dr Preuss, for example) in what <hi rend="italic">year</hi> Wille engraved (<hi rend="italic">at</hi> Paris, I suppose) and Pesne painted,&#x2014;so that we might put &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">aetatis</hi> 30,&#x201D; &#x201C;<date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>&#x201D; or whatever the year is,&#x2014;it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a useful adjunct.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Portrait of Frederick by Antoine Pesne (<date when="1683-00-00">1683</date>&#x2013;<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>), originally engraved by Johann Georg Wille (<date when="1715-00-00">1715</date>&#x2013;<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>). TC&#x2019;s engraving was by Stanislaus Lukomsky (<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1667-00-00">67</date>), overseen by Johann August Eduard Mandel (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>); see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590211-TC-JN-01"><sic>35:31</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1859-02-11">11 Feb.</date></corr></ref> It was used as the frontispiece to vol. 3 of the 1st edn. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>), where &#x201C;Berlin, <date when="1742-01-00">Jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi>. 1742</date>&#x201D; was added under Pesne&#x2019;s name and &#x201C;Berlin <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>, after Wille&#x201D; under Lukomsky&#x2019;s; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 15:frontispiece.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-36-6" n="36:6"/>2<hi rend="italic">&#xB0;</hi> With regard to the Second Print (after Francke&#x2019;s Picture),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Portrait of Frederick by Heinrich Francke (<date when="1738-00-00">1738</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792-00-00">92</date>).</note>&#x2014;tho&#x2019; this too is beautifully worked, and the figure, attitude, &#x26;c are perfect,&#x2014;I am sorry to say that the <hi rend="italic">face</hi> is entirely a failure, an inconceivable <hi rend="italic">mistake,</hi> from beginning to end; and will not do at all! What it is that Herr Mandel has been copying, or where he got that face, I cannot understand. Francke&#x2019;s Picture in the Schickler Banking House is still vividly present to me,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had seen the painting, thought at the time to be by Anton Graff, on his visit to the Schickler Bros. bank in Berlin, <date when="1852-10-00">Oct. 1852</date>; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521007-TC-LOA-01"><sic>27:325</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1852-10-07">7 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551223-TC-JN-01"><sic>30:145</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1855-12-23">23 Dec. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> and I have a Photograph of it, sent me by Herr Magnus<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eduard Magnus (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>), German portrait painter; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590114-TC-JN-01"><sic>35:8</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1859-01-14">14 Jan.</date></corr></ref></note> long ago; there is also, beside me here for two years past, an <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Francke (done for an English Lord,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir John Borlase-Warren (<date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>), whose grandson W.

How it has come I know not; but here is the Schickler Photograph (the face <hi rend="italic">wanted</hi> and bargained for); there is the face <hi rend="italic">sent:</hi>&#x2014;irreparably unlike; another face, another character; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will not do at all! The expression in the Photograph is of <hi rend="italic">aggressive</hi> inspection, polite yet Kinglike vigilance &#x26; command; that of the Engraving is of peaceable <hi rend="italic">passive</hi> amenity; polite, but almost weak; nothing of the <hi rend="italic">King</hi> in it, more like a polite Professor of Belles-Lettres: it is <hi rend="italic">passive,</hi> timid; not <hi rend="italic">aggressive,</hi> royal, lion-like. What is to be done! I have shown the thing to some Artist friends:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Robert Tait and the Pre-Raphaelite painter and designer Ford Madox Brown (<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">93</date>; <ref target="volume-36/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3604"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590505-TC-FMB-01"><sic>35:88&#x2013;89</sic><corr>TC to FMB, <date when="1859-05-05">5 May</date></corr></ref>); otherwise unidentified.</note> they find almost every feature altered: the scalp (which looks more like a wig, as it sh<hi rend="italic">d not</hi> do) is set on the brow at a wrong angle (<hi rend="italic">droops</hi> to right); brow itself is visibly of different slope; eyebrows, eye, &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;and what strikes myself much or most, is the nature of the <hi rend="italic">mouth;</hi> shaped here like a mild Apollo&#x2019;s-bow, and carefully shut (lest it bite something), instead of carelessly half-open (as in the original), and protruding rather, with a fine unconscious defiance in it.&#x2014; In brief, the expression given to the face in the Engraving is fatally <hi rend="italic">different</hi> from that in the original at Schickler&#x2019;s wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I want;&#x2014;and as it is, more especially, pretty much the <hi rend="italic">reverse</hi> of what readers are likely to gather from the Book I am writing, it will never do for Frontispiece <hi rend="italic">there.</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC used a portrait of Frederick&#x2019;s sister, Friederike Sophie Wilhelmine (<date when="1709-00-00">1709</date>&#x2013;<date when="1758-00-00">58</date>; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550828-TC-JAC-01"><sic>30:47</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1855-08-28">28 Aug. 1855</date></corr></ref>), margravine of Baireuth, from a picture in Count von Usedom&#x2019;s collection, for the frontispiece of vol. 4 (<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>); see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:frontispiece.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-36-7" n="36:7"/>My opinion, and that of all my Artist Advisers is, This face must be <hi rend="italic">abolished</hi> (erased from the metal altogether), and the Francke one then put in. <hi rend="italic">Put in</hi> the Francke one (of Schickler&#x2019;s-Bank) must be; or else I can get no good of it. Here is the Photograph; forward <hi rend="italic">it</hi> to Berlin; the Proof Print they, of course, have there: bid them look on this picture then on that! And finally contrive to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> the real face for me;&#x2014;which must be little of a problem (if tried on clear terms) to such Artists as I see these are.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;look at this picture,&#x201D; cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 3.4.

Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> knit me (as you will right well) a pair, or even two pairs, of right sock boots (proper length of <hi rend="italic">foot</hi> not erring on the <hi rend="italic">short</hi> side, and with some <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> in them as well as <hi rend="italic">spring</hi>): these will perfectly equip me ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the dry cold for this current winter.

<salute>Dear Marshall,</salute>
<p>You can, with my profound respects, assure H. R. H. The Grand Duke that I am fully sensible to the honour he does me;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl Alexander, grand duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, had offered TC the Order of the White Falcon (see <sic>23</sic><corr><ref target="volume-36/lt-18591209-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1859-12-09">9 Dec.</date></ref></corr>). He wrote, <date when="1859-11-09">9 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I have long admired your genius, long taken a lively interest in those of your writings especially, which, while they clearly reflect the intellectual life of Germany to the minds of your countrymen, prove at the same time a profound source of instruction to our own. It is natural therefore that the approaching festivities in honor of the most national and popular of our Poets should remind me of your peculiar merit as one of the earliest of Schiller&#x2019;s biographers,&#x2014;and no less natural that, on such an occasion, I should request your acceptance of the accompanying token of my sincere acknowledgement of that merit, as well as of other important literary performances, by which you have deserved the lasting gratitude of two Nations.&#x201D; The letter was written in Marshall&#x2019;s hand. For TC&#x2019;s biography of Schiller (<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>), see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 25. The centenary of Schiller&#x2019;s birth was <date when="1859-11-10">10 Nov.</date>, and the certificate that accompanied the Order was also dated <date when="1859-11-10">10 Nov.</date>; see <sic>14</sic><corr>above</corr>.</note> and that there is no law or custom in England to prevent a man from deciding as he himself pleases in regard to such matters.</p>
<p>As to my own particular case, there are only two facts which I now submit to you: then well considered, and taken as candidly true, the decision shall be yours, not mine. The two facts are:</p>
<p>1<hi rend="italic">&#xB0;</hi>. That the fixed intention of such a favour, from such a Quarter, is itself a <pb id="pg-36-10" n="36:10"/>real possession to me, and will always privately be a proud little item in my memory henceforth. This you will have no difficulty in believing.</p>
<p>2<hi rend="italic">&#xB0;</hi>. That the wearing, or publicly using, of any Title, foreign or domestic, great or small, would not now appear suitable or be a satisfaction to me, as things go and have gone. This also you may take to be very certain.</p>
<p>So that, strictly speaking, it is the Princely Intention alone that can be really precious to me;&#x2014;and this being already indisputable, and even officially on record, the question of completing it or not completing I will leave to your own tact, insight, and polite management, on those data.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18591128-TC-JMA-01">TC to <sic>JM</sic><corr>JMA</corr>, <date when="1859-11-28">28 Nov.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>With many homages to His Royal Highness and to the High Lady<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had apparently not heard of the death, <date when="1859-06-23">23 June</date>, of Maria Paulowna, Marshall&#x2019;s employer and Karl Alexander&#x2019;s mother. TC had met her in Weimar in <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520925-TC-JWC-01"><sic>27:301&#x2013;2</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1852-09-25">25 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>. Marshall replied, <date when="1859-11-21">21 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;Perhaps you may think of writing H. R. H. soon &#x2026; ; it may be as well to remind you that the Grand-Duchess-Mother, your old Belvedere friend, died in <date when="1859-00-00">June</date> last, and that Their Royal Highnesses lost their second daughter, a sweet little girl of about nine years old, only a month before.&#x201D;</note> whom you have the honour to serve, I remain

<p>I have had-on the <hi rend="italic">greys,</hi> which you consider the weaker pair, three or four times, while the frost lasted; they kept me about completely warm, altogether so when I chose to ride fast: so that, with the stouter brown pair, I consider myself safe against any kind of weather.

<p>I am driven as I never was by that unutterable horror of a Prussian Book; which has quite broken my heart, and indeed has often seemed as if it would kill me outright before I had done with it. We are to <hi rend="italic">begin printing</hi> (taliter qualiter [for what it&#x2019;s worth] for all is still chaos!) in about a month; and if I can hold out, <hi rend="italic">un</hi>choked by the tumble of this Brandenburg shot-rubbish and immeasurable <hi rend="italic">Sand-Walz</hi> [wallowing in sand] over sky and earth, for about one year at the top of my speed, <hi rend="italic">then,</hi> O Heavens, then&#x2014;! &#x2014;! In quiet truth, there never came athwart me any job comparable to this, since life began (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has had a good many ugly ones); and I doubt if any writing creature, not himself of quite chaotic nature, in this age or the last, ever got such a dainty dish (with so <hi rend="italic">many</hi> pecks of dirt in it) to regale himself upon before.</p>
<p>I ride daily at a vigorous rate; speak to no creature; am as a ghost among my fellows,&#x2014;only that I sometimes <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi> a little on horseback, in the raw smoky dusk and fragrant fogs of these parts: ghosts, I believe, do not take tobacco at all.</p>
<p>Horse<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s horse, Fritz.</note> is at the door even now; and I must go. We were in Scotland, a four whole months almost, last Summer &#x26; Autumn;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC and JWC had spent from late <date when="1859-00-00">June</date> to late <date when="1859-09-00">Sept.</date> in Fife, first at Humbie Farm, nr. Aberdour, and then at Auchtertool House, Auchtertool; see vol. 35.</note> my Wife extremely in need of some strengthening did improve on the beautiful shores of Fife,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the London frosts are again sore upon her.</p>
<p>Adieu; all good be with you, dear Marshall.</p>

She wrote to JWC from Florence, <date when="1860-03-09">9 March 1860</date>: &#x0201C;I was overjoyed yesterday to get a letter from my sister M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ashurst, telling me that she had seen you, and that all the mischief was in the accursed post &#x02026; . [A]ll the letters I have directed either to Chelsea or Fulham have been lost. &#x02026; I had grown afraid to write&#x02014;your silence had in it something to me quite mysterious and sinister. I feared you were ill, wretched, or at least forgetful of poor me&#x02014; For all this folly my excuse is that I have written three times since yours which I received &#x26; answered immediately from Vallombrosa, having no answers and being continually ill&#x02014;exceptionally so even and very worried and low spirited, I got into an obstinate fit of determining to see none but the gloomiest possible explanation. &#x02026; [S]o I wrote Bessie a request that she would find out the truth for me. She never noticed my request in her next letter &#x02026; I chose for a short time to consider you had either received her coldly or not at all&#x02014;then softening again to the memory of all your kindness and sympathy I repeated it&#x02014;and found that the first letter to her had miscarried, and that you were all I wished, and ought to have trusted and known you to be for me still. Dear you must forgive me, now I have confessed all my wickedness, for you know only too much how physical gloom brings with it mental distress &#x26; discomfort. I made an entire mistake in coming to Florence, and then had not funds enough to go away: the climate is abominable, I see no difference between this and one of the worst London winters, except in as much as that in London we have carpets, fires, curtains, etc., in abundance, and here everything is cheap except <hi rend="italic">comfort,</hi> which is quite beyond the reach of any but the really rich&#x02014; So I have been in constant trouble and sickness&#x02014;first and foremost the old trouble, and then and now with neuralgia&#x02014; I have however a clever D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> now, who has driven me by force away from the city, and though I cannot yet&#x02014;owing to the bitter winds&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">live</hi> in the open air as he wished&#x02014;I feel&#x02014;even from my constant seat by the troublesome unsatisfactory wood fire some of the benefit of the purer air, and am better again at last. My worst trouble by far though, because a small, constant, everyday worry, has been my young frivolous companion in perpetual need of an excitement and variety I could not give her, and fretting herself into semi-illness and whole hippishness.&#x0201D; Bessie Ashurst was her sister-in-law, wife of William Henry Ashurst (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x02013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>), solicitor.</note> I am asked to go to the Grange &#x0201C;to be made strong&#x0201D;!!

<p>I have not for many a day had a welcomer bit of writing handed in to me than your friendly honest Note the other morning. My Letters here,&#x2014;&#x201C;impacts from the owls of the Parish on the poor old Horn-lantern with a <pb id="pg-36-19" n="36:19"/>candle-end lighted in it,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC appears to mean dull people drawn to anything with a spark of light in it; cf. <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590130-TC-LOA-01"><sic>35:17</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1859-01-30">30 Jan.</date></corr></ref></note>&#x2014;are not oftenest of an exhilarating character!--I am shocked to discover tonight that I have not yet answered: I imagined I had, the same day; and so omitted you on &#x201C;Letter-Answering Day&#x201C;: but my Wife by her question brings me accurately to book; so before going to bed, I do it,&#x2014;and close the day in a pleasant way.</p>
<p>We staid a long time in Scotland, chiefly in Fife, almost 3 months there, sea-bathing &#x26;c, then 3 or 4 weeks in Annandale; did not get home till deep in October:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC arrived home <date when="1859-10-01">1 Oct. 1859</date>; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18591003-TC-JAC-01"><sic>35:223</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1859-10-03">3 Oct.</date></corr></ref> JWC returned home <date when="1859-09-23">23 Sept.</date>; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590924-JWC-TC-01"><sic>35:215</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1859-09-24">24 Sept.</date></corr></ref></note> it is long since I had such a spell of idleness and rustication; and both Wife and I had had need of enough of &#x201C;trying something&#x201D; for a little improvement if possible. My belief is, we both got considerable good of the adventure: she was evidently a good deal stronger on setting out homeward, and has never yet quite given in, tho&#x2019; not now on the improving hand at all, as winter with his fogs and frosts advances. I on the other hand traced my chief improvement <hi rend="italic">after</hi> getting home, and resuming my unutterable &#x201C;literary enterprise&#x201D; after a long cessation. In fine here we are, in the old equipment, fronting the winter rather on better omens than last year, nor on worse.</p>
<p>I ride diligently and with vigour every day (Horse immensely improved by Scotch <hi rend="italic">rye-grass</hi> and other solacements of country life): I sit all day to the chin in Brandenburg rubbish; groom comes at half past 3, &#x201C;Oss, Sir!&#x201C;&#x2014;and I go scouring about till deep in the dusk, a most spectral object on four legs. Very spectral, alas, both inwardly and [out]wardly! I live in nearly perfect loneliness here. [S]peak<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters obscured.</note> to no person (Wife does all the society there is); and stand with my whole remaining strength to the task of getting this intolerable millstone cut away from my poor neck! That is pretty much all the hope I have left now in the world. In perhaps another Twelvemonth, if I can hold out so long, there may be deliverance,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The next vol.

(6) in <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>.</note> or clearer hope of such;&#x2014;God send it! I really never in my Life was so held to the grindstone by anything laid on me; were I once out of this, on any tolerable terms whatever, it is my fixed purpose to rest for the remainder of my life,&#x2014;and after that, we may look with some confidence to <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> of a good <hi rend="italic">eternal</hi> sort; welcome to the wearied who can go no farther!&#x2014;</p>

For, between you and me, the two numbers of the said Courier which I have seen, by favour of Hamilton Vetch,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Col.

My own dear Haddingtonshire! which I had loved for its sincere stupidity, and contented dullness,&#x2014;for its dignity of <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> when it had nothing to say,&#x2014;for its practical industry when it had nothing to think! <hi rend="italic">It</hi> too burst out into gabble-gabbling, as of infinite geese!&#x2014; Puffing, Lecturing, Speechifying rising up in every corner of it! even <hi rend="italic">Garvald</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Village 6 mi.

<p>But it wasn&#x2019;t to say all this either,&#x2014;not a single sentence of it,&#x2014;that I began to write!</p>
<p>To come to the point then, In one of those Haddingtonshire Couriers I read a notice of the death of <hi rend="italic">John Rennie</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Rennie (ca. <date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), farmer of Oxwell Mains.</note> rather long and complimentary. When George Rennie (his nephew)<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s old friend and admirer; John Rennie was the brother of Marion (b. <date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>), George&#x2019;s mother.</note> was here the other day, I told him of it, and found him, to my astonishment, in profound ignorance of his uncle&#x2019;s death! He remembered that he had once <hi rend="italic">had</hi> such an uncle; but didn&#x2019;t seem to have heard of him, or turned him in his head for the last thirty years!! Whereupon I could no longer suppress many things I had had in my mind to say to George this long while&#x2014;about his estrangement from his relations and early friends&#x2014;all except myself&#x2014;and not thanks to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> exception, I told him; &#x201C;for he held to <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> only as <hi rend="italic">Sinbad the Sailor</hi> held to the <hi rend="italic">old-man-of-the-mountain</hi> whom he couldn&#x2019;t for the life of him get shaken of!&#x201C;&#x2014; Now, if he made <hi rend="italic">new</hi> friends, I shouldn&#x2019;t have thought him worth railing at so much; but the poor fellow has only <hi rend="italic">acquaintances!</hi> And besides I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> he has a good heart&#x2014;but &#x201C;Lucifer Son of the morning!&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isa. 14:12.</note> got into it in the beginning, and barred all ingress to it, and put a dreary &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">to Let</hi>&#x2019; in its windows! So he is more to be pitied than blamed.&#x2014; Stop!&#x2014; I am quite away from the business in hand again!</p>
<p>I have had next to no sleep for many nights, and in that case I get always dreadfully discursive and metaphorical!&#x2014; Pardon!</p>
<p>The result of our dispute, was, that he owned to being &#x201C;proud and shy, and not hardhearted&#x201D; and owned even to a sudden affectionate interest (better later than never!) in the old Uncle John, and a real desire to read what had been said about him in the Haddington paper.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The obituary noted that John Rennie &#x201C;belong[ed] to a family long well known and highly respected in East Lothian. &#x2026; Rennie during a lengthened life maintained the reputation of an excellent man and an intelligent agriculturalist. &#x2026; [He] delighted, as a young man, in athletic exercises, and many anecdotes are told of his strength and courage&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Haddingtonshire Courier,</hi> <date when="1859-11-18">18 Nov.</date>).</note></p>
<p>You see now what I want? Colonel Vetch took back those papers to send them to some one else. And unless <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can get a copy of that far back number <pb id="pg-36-22" n="36:22"/>for me, I shan&#x2019;t be able to gratify poor George&#x2019;s little impulse of family feeling. which I am naturally interested in; feeling as if I had if not planted it, at least developed it myself!</p>
<p>Are you cross? Is it a trouble?&#x2014; I don&#x2019;t know why I am so unscrupulous in troubling <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> remembrance I suppose of your goodnature to me about the&#x2014;Problems<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably referring to Dods helping JWC with her algebra at school; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 43&#x2013;44.</note>&#x2014;and&#x2014;the white cotton stockings.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had once lent JWC his white cotton stockings; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570919-JWC-WDO-01"><sic>33:88</sic><corr>JWC to WDO, <date when="1857-09-19">19 Sept. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I ask nothing about the Old Church<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Visiting Haddington at the end of <date when="1859-06-00">June 1859</date>, JWC had been horrified at the state of the parish church where her father was buried; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590903-JWC-WDO-01"><sic>35:189&#x2013;90</sic><corr>JWC to WDO, <date when="1859-09-03">3 Sept.</date></corr></ref> The <hi rend="italic">Haddingtonshire Courier</hi> reported, <date when="1859-10-28">28 Oct.</date>, the &#x201C;Dangerous State of the Parish Church. &#x2026; [T]he south wall was bulging out nearly eight or nine inches beyond the perpendicular.

My love to your Wife. I have been very ill again, and my dog has been run over by a Butcher&#x2019;s cart. Ever affectionately Yours Jane Welsh Carlyle</p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>This is one of the blackest Fogs ever seen,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported, <date when="1859-12-13">13 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;The metropolis on Sunday afternoon was enveloped in the most dense fog we have been visited with since <date when="1851-10-00">October 1851</date>; from half-past 12 at noon until 2 o&#x2019;clock the darkness was so intense that it was dangerous to attempt crossing the carriage-road.&#x201D;</note> which we have today; scarcely with light to read; and as silent up here as if I were in Craigenputtoch in my old backshop among the everlasting moors again. At any rate I have no right to try much labour today; and am now for sallying out (streets to be all <hi rend="italic">mapped</hi> in one&#x2019;s head, and attention kept) for a little vigorous walking;&#x2014;but will first send you a couple of words, as one small act of propriety in one&#x2019;s day of rest.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2. Sunday.</note></p>
<p>I quite forgot to mention the Hareskin Breastplate last time! But I have by no means forgotten to put it about me nightly before going to bed (by day it was superfluous, and took some trouble); and an excellent thing I find it, all tight, cosy, and fur next the skin: fairly the best medicine I have yet found for that new ailment of mine.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bronchitis; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18591023-TC-JAC-01"><sic>35:240</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1859-10-23">23 Oct.</date></corr></ref></note> I am much obliged to you for all your assiduous continual kindness; and ought to say, nothing has been more successful than this particular item.</p>
<p>We are a little better here; i.e. Jane is and <hi rend="italic">stealthily</hi> gets out again on a mild day; as to myself I have never been making complaint, but am always able to go plodding on at the sad prescribed step: one of the gloomiest quiet lives, if I did not hope it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> mend in the course of certain months. My progress is sorrowfully slow, but it seldom or never entirely stops. Please Heaven we shall get this intolerable slave-chain <hi rend="italic">filed thro&#x2019;</hi> at last; and then there will be improved times, let us hope!&#x2014;</p>

Curiously enough, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Falconer spoke of those early days in very much the same tone; expressing an anxious desire to see you. I must tell you that she married Capt Keith&#x2014;afterwards Keith-Falconer,&#x2014;one of the sons of the Earl of Kintore. Capt Keith built the new house at Monkrigg,&#x2014;but long after you left Haddington; and after his death several years ago, she sold the place. She has been living at the Earl of Kintore&#x2019;s seat in Aberdeenshire since then, for the most part, in charge of the young earl as guardian; and her home is now at 3 Eaton Square. As she signs herself &#x2018;L,&#x2019; I have no doubt she is the &#x2018;Louisa&#x2019; of your memory, though her brown hair is grey now. But she is as youthful &#x26; cheerful in mind as ever. I found she had, as her ladys maid, a niece of Mrs. Brook, who stole into the room (while I was alone in it) to see a Haddington face! She gave me a most glowing account of her mistress&#x2019;s character. It was the first time I had been in the house; and positively the first time in which I was ever regarded in the light of a small lion. But a Haddington animal of this sort, even of the very smallest, is such a rarity, that I feel it is possible to be a curiosity, &#x26; at the same time a very ordinary creature after all.&#x201D; Smiles&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Self-Help: With Illustrations of Character and Conduct</hi> was published late <date when="1859-11-00">Nov.</date>; 20,000 copies were sold in its first year.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I have caught cold; I have got toothache, and an ugly fixed pain in the brow (both of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> latter phenomena are new to me); in fact I am quite on my beam-ends, and no prospect of righting, but the contrary, before Saturday! We must give it up, my friend, or do <hi rend="italic">worse,&#x2014;</hi>till these bad elements (not to speak of the glassy frost unfriendly to human nature and to equine) pass away, as they will do.</p>
<p>I am sorry to disappoint myself,&#x2014;far sorrier than you will believe;&#x2014;but there is no alternative. <hi rend="italic">Esperons</hi> [let us hope].</p>
<closer><salute>Yours ever &#x2F;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Dods</salute>
<p>I don&#x2019;t often get out of all patience with the contradictions of one&#x2019;s daily life; having convinced myself long ago, that it is more profit to follow Paddy&#x2019;s rule; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">keep never minding</hi>&#x201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471118-TC-JF-01"><sic>22:161</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1847-11-18">18 Nov. 1847</date></corr></ref>; see also A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:110.</note> But today I am&#x2014;furious!!&#x2014;there is no other word for it!</p>
<p>Last night I had just sat down to write some letters for newyears day: a good long one to you, and another good long one to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Davidson<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Davidson&#x2019;s aunt Janet Davidson.</note> among others; when two Gentlemen<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> &#x201C;dropt in&#x201D; to tea and staid till twelve o&#x2019;clock. Well! I should have time before the General post hour today,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters could be posted at pillar boxes until 5 p.m.,<hi rend="italic"> at the General Post Office, St. Martin&#x2019;s le Grand, until 6 p.m., or until 7 p.m.</hi> upon payment (in stamps) of an extra 1d.</note> I thought; and went to bed without wishing any serious mischief to these Gentlemen. But today!, Oh my Gracious!&#x2014; I had hardly got my book-parcels &#x26;c made up, and one little hasty letter scribbled to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Skirving;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Lindsay Skirving (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>), an old Haddington acquaintance; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571123-JWC-AHO-01"><sic>33:126</sic><corr>JWC to AHO, <date when="1857-11-23">23 Nov. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> when I was broken in upon by such a rush of improvised botherations, continuing till long after post-time; that I find myself now, at night, as tired, and dissatisfied, and enraged as if I had been kept all day thrashing&#x2014;chaff!</p>
<p>In case tomorrow should prove as unfavourable to expansions of the heart&#x2014;on paper; I write this notekin before going to bed, just that you may know it is from no want of good will that no &#x201C;nice long new year letter&#x201D; accompanies the Book-parcel&#x2014; Tho&#x2019;&#x2014;! to be sure!&#x2014;there is perhaps no <pb id="pg-36-34" n="36:34"/>great amount of good-will due from me, to people, who, when I see them after a year can never bestow on me more time than &#x201C;twenty minutes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But I believe you good and kind <hi rend="italic">in a general way</hi>&#x2014; So I make a request to you: to go <hi rend="italic">this minute</hi> to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> David Davidson&#x2019;s<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Davidson; her husband had also been named David.</note> and see if she have received, the only gift I could think of for her; dear suffering soul! likely to be any good&#x2014;an indian rubber bottle for holding warm water&#x2014; It is the most pliant comfortable thing in a bed! and fits in to any part of the body where there is an ache that heat can relieve or mitigate. Show her how to unscrew the top, and if she have not a small funnel for filling it; will you buy her one&#x2014;you will get a tin one for two or three pence. And explain to her that her new-years day letter is not forgotten nor omitted&#x2014;only delayed by stress of circumstances&#x2014;</p>
<p>God bless you and all your belongings&#x2014;my love to your eldest Sister.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marion Wilkie (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>) lived with their other sister, Mary Ann Wilkie (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>), at Tyne House, Haddington.</note> <hi rend="italic">She</hi> seemed to me more pleased to see me last autumn than <hi rend="italic">you</hi> ever are&#x2014; I can&#x2019;t get over the &#x201C;twenty minutes&#x201D;</p>

<p>If my &#x201C;wishes&#x201D; could make your New Year good, dear Lady, it should be the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> in London or England!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The daylight is just going, the Candles not lighted; and I have one word to write you before creeping into my own Corner to go in for a little <hi rend="italic">prae-prandial</hi> sleep.</p>
<p>We are not coming home tomorrow; we have been persuaded to &#x201C;another day,&#x201D; and are (for certain, if no accident befal) to come <hi rend="italic">on Friday.</hi> This is really all I had to say; you will find us on Friday; and I expect to get upon my own horse on friday again. This day and the foregoing days I have had enormous gallopings on turf; which indeed are the salutary element of life to me here: but quietude and a slower pace will again be welcome to me</p>
<p>Jane takes well with her new atmosphere, and is decidedly better within these two or three days: I for my part am well enough too,&#x2014;i.e. pretty near the common average again; tho for the first few days I was decidedly hurt by my changes.</p>
<p>Your Saturday Review arrived duly: thanks.</p>
<p>The light is quite done<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The bottom of the page has been cut away.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>We got home yesternight, and are in our old posture again: so much I may tell you, tho there is hardly opportunity for more.</p>
<p>Jane seemed to suit the business better than I; and indeed she has returned, to appearance, with a small decided improvement for the time being: she slept better; enjoyed the much talk that was going; profited by the heated air (House all warmed by pipes)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the first Lord Ashburton (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>) had introduced the central heating system into The Grange; TC&#x2019;s first visit there was in <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>, when he commented that the house had &#x201C;modern improvements&#x201D; on Inigo Jones&#x2019;s original interior and &#x201C;every convenience&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440914-TC-JWC-01"><sic>18:208</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1844-09-14">14 Sept. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c. As for myself I was decidedly wretched, for the first three days (a dirty feverish <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> spread all over me); a heart very sad, and a body very sore, in my sudden new element: but afterwards, chiefly by galloping over the fine grassy downs, I got quieter, and did tolerably well. Nothing could be kinder than our Hosts were old and new; nice people too, of a shining enough quality, went &#x26; came: but alas&#x2014;! In short I am glad to be at home again; and to get at last into the one consolation that does not fail one in this world, that of getting grappled with the <hi rend="italic">task</hi> laid out for us, and trying at least to do something upon that.</p>

<salute>My dear Miss Barnes</salute>
<p>I send you a Pheasant, which is a <hi rend="italic">Trophy</hi> as well as a dead Bird! For I brought it home with me last night, from one of the most stupendous massacres <pb id="pg-36-43" n="36:43"/>of feathered Innocents that ever took place &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">here down</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> (as Mazzini expresses himself) From seven hundred to a thousand pheasants shot in one day! The firing made me perfectly sick! Think of the bodily and mental state of the surviving Birds when the days <hi rend="italic">sport</hi> was ended! Decidedly men can be very great Brutes when they like!</p>
<p>We have been away for ten days at the Grange&#x2014;(Lord Ashburtons place in Hampshire) where I always thrive better than anywhere else&#x2014;and where as you see there are many Pheasants!</p>
<p>I went to take leave of you before we went, but saw all the blinds down and grew sick with fright!&#x2014; I went into M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Gigner&#x2019;s shop<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Gigner, chemist, 131 King&#x2019;s Rd., Chelsea.</note> and inquired was anything the matter&#x2014;and he told me of your new loss.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the death of a close relative; not further identified.</note>&#x2014; At least, it was an immense relief to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to hear that your Father<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Alfred Brooke Barnes.</note> and yourself were not ill or worse&#x2014;</p>
<p>After that I thought a note about <hi rend="italic">my</hi> insignificant movements would only bother your Father&#x2014;so I left him to learn my whereabouts from the&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Morning Post!</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably from a list of guests at The Grange pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi></note> certain he would be too much preoccupied for looking after me at all&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton</salute>
<p>The worst of that Arabian-Nights-Entertainment sort of thing is that, coming back to one&#x2019;s ordinary Life, one finds it has gained immeasurably in dinginess and dulness!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Our</hi> ordinary Life recommenced at Waterloo Station; where I had to leave off thinking about The Grange, and its <hi rend="italic">goings on,</hi> and about <hi rend="italic">you</hi> and your adorable kindness; that I might seek and identify our various luggage; which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C insisted was &#x201C;hopelessly engulphed in the Belly of Chaos&#x201D;!&#x2014;where it might have remained, for any step that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would stir in the matter!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-36-44" n="36:44"/>Then followed the drive in a rickety bad-smelling street-cab, thro&#x2019; fog and mud; justifying M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s exclamation: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Ough!</hi> my Dear! This is a <hi rend="italic">terribly clarty</hi> City we are come back to!&#x201D;</p>
<p>When we stopt at our own door; my heart was going &#x201C;like-like-like-<hi rend="italic">anything!</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; source untraced; cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340225-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:109</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-02-25">25 Feb. 1834</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440712-JWC-JW-01"><sic>18:130</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1844-07-12">12 July 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> about the wee sick Dog.

<p>The door was opened;&#x2014;no bark! My eyes plunged into the lobby; no Dog!&#x2014; &#x201C;Is he dead&#x201D;? I asked at the Servant; and, simultaneously with the question, came the answer: &#x201C;Oh Mam! <hi rend="italic">He</hi> is a little better!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Was it a sin and a shame to say&#x2014;&#x201C;Thank God?&#x201C;&#x2014;whether or not; I said it!</p>
<p>Poor little Creature! he had hurried to the bottom of the stairs, to receive us &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">avec explosion</hi>&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; a phrase from French drama, according to JWC; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480928-JWC-JW-01"><sic>23:124</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1848-09-28">28 Sept. 1848</date></corr></ref>.

<p>I tell you about my Dog, knowing that you also had a dog, and believing that one&#x2019;s dog makes all dogs <hi rend="italic">touching</hi> for one!</p>
<p>For the rest; having come back to a &#x201C;clarty City&#x201D; is nothing like so bad as having come back to <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great!</hi> You can&#x2019;t imagine what it is to have to pass one&#x2019;s days in the Valley of the Shadow<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf.

I sometimes thought how cruel it was on her, to whom &#x2018;Frederick&#x2019; was literally nothing except through me, so cruel, alas, alas, and yet inevitable! Never once in her deepest misery did she hint, by word or sign, what she too was suffering under that score; me only did she ever seem to pity in it, the heroic, the thrice noble, and wholly loving soul!&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s headnote in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:18).</note></p>

<p>I have brought back with me the picture of it and of the life carried on in it, retouched and brightened up in my head; and have brought back with me loving and trusting feelings towards <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> my Lady, which are a pleasant wonder to myself! so set had I been on never caring for you the least bit!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to Anne Gilchrist, <date when="1860-02-17">17 Feb.</date>, JWC had said, &#x201C;[I had] resolved not to like her, but had been obliged to; &#x2018;stood out five days&#x2019; &#x2026; but when on &#x2018;the fifth day she came up into my room, and spoke like an unaffected Highland girl, that Lady Ashburton won my heart; she spoke so freely and unguardedly about persons and things; most people in that station so guarded and careful&#x2019;&#x201D; (Gilchrist 82&#x2013;83).</note> having got it in my head that it would be a sort of infidelity, a sort of disloyalty to ever care for another Lady Ashburton than Her<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Harriet Ashburton.</note> who had shown me so much kindness and exercised so much influence over me, during some fourteen years!</p>
<p>It was a narrow ungenerous idea; as if one&#x2019;s human heart were like the stone house one lived in, laid out in a certain number of rooms of certain dimensions! I have overcome it or rather <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have overcome it&#x2014;to my great relief!</p>
<p>This is a delicate topic to engage in with <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> but you encouraged me by saying the first word; with a noble frankness which touched me more than I can express!&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x2014; And so&#x2014;at parting&#x2014; I made you that proposal,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> meaning every syllable of it; and hoping that, by its <hi rend="italic">audacity</hi> if nothing else, you might be surprised into bearing it practically in mind.</p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I am sorry to interrupt the deliberate composure of your survey of &#x201C;Book I&#x201C;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600104-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1860-01-04">4 Jan.</date></ref></note> but here has the Printer made his appearance; and he is eager to be at work!</p>
<p>I can see nothing for it but that after <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> carefully some 10 or 12 of the first leaves (and making your jottings about them) you give them up to Robson; taking the rest more at leisure,&#x2014;for he will not be in a very great hurry of speed; and is certain to waste a few days at the very first, in making adjustments, and settling preliminaries.</p>
<p>I shall not <hi rend="italic">correct</hi> anything till I see the whole Book in slips;&#x2014;if you could get y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> leaves <hi rend="italic">back</hi> from Robson for me, in a printed state; and let me have the whole (with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> remarks) on Sunday night next, that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the utmost I could expect, and indeed w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do well enough.</p>
<p>I have promised that you will call on Robson (1. New Street, Fetter Lane,&#x2014;any time <hi rend="italic">before</hi> 4 p.m.) either tomorrow (Tuesday) or next day (&#x201C;next day,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No closing quotation marks in MS.</note> most likely); and give him a few leaves <hi rend="italic">if you can.</hi> Make the best bargain for me you can, on the above conditions. If you find that it will decidedly be better that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have the whole Book once more in <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> before me, settle it <hi rend="italic">so;</hi> and let the enterprise of <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> be put off for a week more.&#x2014;&#x2014; You may fancy what a flurry all this is for the dejected weary mind! I shudder to contemplate what lies ahead for the next 12 months. But there is <hi rend="italic">deliverance</hi> too, if we can hold out so long!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> next; and you need not <hi rend="italic">write</hi> to me ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Robson &#x26;c unless necessary.</p>

<salute>My dear Mary</salute>
<p>The Box is come. I have just unpacked it &#x201C;with my own hands.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; Edward Irving&#x2019;s phrase; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210102-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:301</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-10-02">2 Oct. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> and much admire the contents! Especially the big beautiful eggs, which look little short of a miracle (the number of them) to people who have all the winter been ferretting out an egg here and there, at twopence halpenny a-piece, with as much difficulty of search as if they had been, every one, a gold nugget!</p>
<p>The breakage this time has been trifling compared with the last<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably early <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590115-JWC-MCA-01"><sic>35:9&#x2013;10</sic><corr>JWC to MCA, <date when="1859-01-15">15 Jan. 1859</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590207-JWC-MCA-01"><sic>21&#x2013;22</sic><corr>JWC to MCA, <date when="1859-02-07">7 Feb. 1859</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;only the three or four loose eggs on the top of the fowls were <hi rend="italic">absolutely</hi> squelched. A good many in the basket were craked, or bruised, but the damage went no further. The Gill fowls are always welcomed &#x201C;in our choicest mood.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; another of Edward Irving&#x2019;s phrases; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281200-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>4:424</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1828-12-00">Dec. 1828</date>></corr></ref>.</note> and the great currant loaf has already received the compliment of having a good half slice of it swallowed down M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s throat; to my immense surprise! for not only does he avoid all such &#x201C;dainties&#x201D; as a general rule; but today in particular his &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Interior</hi>&#x201D; had been entirely &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">ruined</hi>&#x201D; by a piece of Pheasant he ate yesterday! and more than usual discretion was to have been expected of him! The fact is; he ate it, I am sure, entirely out of <hi rend="italic">affection</hi> for <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> and as an expression of grateful feeling; not out of any real liking for currant loaf, nor yet &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">as a melancholy distraction,</hi>&#x201D; (the motive he usually assigns for committing any extravagance in eating, breaking into green-pears and such like!)&#x2014;</p>
<p>Thank you much! you are the same dear kind Mary always!</p>
<p>We are only <hi rend="italic">subsiding</hi> still, from the glories of the Grange! and from the indegestions!&#x2014;not that <hi rend="italic">my</hi> individual degestion has been disturbed by the visit. I frankly confess that &#x201C;french cookery&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s household had a French cook, Louis Gabriel Sedille (ca. <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">72</date>), from at least <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570518-JWC-MR-01"><sic>32:147</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1857-05-18">18 May 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> agrees with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> remarkably well! and that I can drink champagne to dinner every day, not only without hurt, but with benefit to my health and spirits.</p>
<p>Then; it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> cheering to get out of &#x2018;the valley of the shadow&#x2019; of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> for even eight days!&#x2014; And it is wonderfully pleasant to live in a house, where by means of hot-water pipes, there is the temperature of summer in the dead of winter!&#x2014; Not to speak of the brilliant talk, and brilliant diamonds, and brilliant ever-so-many things! which tho&#x2019; &#x201C;the flames o&#x2019; Hell&#x201D; <pb id="pg-36-48" n="36:48"/><hi rend="italic">may</hi> certainly &#x201C;come and burn it aa up&#x201D;!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410411-TC-MAC-01"><sic>13:92&#x2013;93</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1841-04-11">11 April 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> is very pretty and pleasant &#x201C;in the <hi rend="italic">mean</hi>-<hi rend="small-caps">while</hi>&#x201D;!</p>
<p>All the prettier and pleasanter for <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> that I have lived more like &#x201C;Owl in Desert&#x201D; of late years, than like an unfeathered articulate speaking <hi rend="italic">woman!</hi> Haunted &#x2018;every day and all&#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Refrain of &#x201C;A Lyke-Wake Dirge.&#x201D;</note> by the Ghost of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great!</hi></p>
<p>And so; I was unusually well at the Grange; and came home in better case than I left it! And much pleased with the new Lady who was kindness&#x2019;s self! a really amiable loveable woman she seems to be; much more intent on making her visitors at their ease and happy, than on showing off <hi rend="italic">her self,</hi> and attracting admiration.</p>
<p>It was in sickening apprehension that I arrived at my own door however. I had left my poor wee Dog so ill&#x2014;of Old Age, complicated with asthma; that I doubted if I should find him alive! It was the first time for eleven years that his welcoming bark had failed me!&#x2014; Was he really dead then? No! strange to say he was actually a little better&#x2014;and had run up the kitchen stairs to welcome me as usual; but <hi rend="italic">there</hi> he had been arrested by a paroxyism of coughing! and the more he tried to show his joy, the more he couldn&#x2019;t do it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C keeps insisting on the propriety of &#x201C;a little prussic acid&#x201D; for him! At the same time, he was overheard saying to him in the Garden one day. &#x201C;Poor little Fellow! I declare I am heartily sorry for you! If I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> make you young again upon my soul I <hi rend="italic">would!</hi>&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also <ref target="volume-36/lt-18591209-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1859-12-09">[9 Dec.] 1859</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now goodby dear Mary. It is time I were in bed. This letter cant go tonight&#x2014;but it will be ready, safe against all contingencies, tomorrow</p>
<p>My kind regards to your Husband<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Austin.</note>&#x2014;and best wishes for you all</p>

<p>A letter from me would have crossed yours (with the Book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Russell had sent JWC <hi rend="italic">Pre-Adamite Man; Or, The Story of Our Old Planet and Its In-habitants, told by Scripture &#x26; Science</hi> (<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), published anon. by Isabelle (Belle) Wight Duncan, b.

The connection in this case is simple enough! I needed a little jacket for home-wear, and possessing a superfluous black-silk scarf, I resolved, in a moment of economical enthusiasm, to make, with my own hands a jacket out of it! For in spite of the &#x201C;thirty thousand distressed needlewomen&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For JWC&#x2019;s views on &#x201C;distressed needlewomen,&#x201D; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560502-TC-JRU-01"><sic>31:80</sic><corr>TC to JRU, <date when="1856-05-02">2 May 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> one hears so much of; the fact remains that nobody can get a <hi rend="italic">decent</hi> article of dress made here unless at enormous cost. And besides, the dressmakers who <hi rend="italic">can</hi> fit one, wont condescend to make anything but with their own materials! So I fell to cutting out that jacket last Monday, and only finished it today (Friday)!! and was so much excited over the unusual nature of the enterprise&#x2014;(For I detest sewing, and dont sew any for weeks together) that I could not leave off for anything that <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be postponed till the jacket was out of hands. But Lord preserve me, what a bother! Better to have bought one ready made at the dearest rate! I wont take a needle in my hands except to sew on M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s buttons for the next six months! By the way would you like the <hi rend="italic">shape</hi> of my jacket which is of the newest. I have it in paper and could send it to you quite handy!</p>
<p>Oh my Dear! I am very much afraid, the reading of that Book will be an even more uncongenial job of work for me than the jacket! and won&#x2019;t have as much to show for itself when done!</p>
<p>If there be one thing I dislike more than <hi rend="italic">Theology</hi> it is <hi rend="italic">Geology!</hi> And here we have <hi rend="italic">both!</hi> beaten up in the same mortar, and incapable, by any amount of <pb id="pg-36-53" n="36:53"/>beating to coalesce!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duncan followed the theory that interpreted the Creation days of Gen. 1 as geological epochs. She then argued that the first humans appeared long before Adam and Eve, during the first era of Creation, which came to an end with the Ice Age. The second era began with Gen. 2:19 and Adam. She explained the absence of fossil evidence by suggesting that the &#x201C;pre-Adamites&#x201D; were transformed into either angels or demons.</note> What <hi rend="italic">could</hi> induce any live woman to fall a-writing that sort of Book? And a decidedly clever woman!&#x2014; I can see that much from the bits I have already read of it, here and there. She expresses her meaning very clearly and elegantly, too.</p>
<p>If it were only on any subject I could get up an interest in, I should read her writing with pleasure. But even when Darwin, in a Book<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Darwin (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>; <ref target="volume-36/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7176"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), naturalist and geologist; his <hi rend="italic">On the Origin of Species</hi> was pbd. <date when="1859-11-24">24 Nov. 1859</date>.

I did not feel that the slightest light would be thrown on my practical life for me by having it ever so logically made out, that my first ancestor millions of millions of ages back had been or even had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been an oyster!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Twisleton wrote to TC, <date when="1860-01-01">1 Jan.</date>, that he thought <hi rend="italic">On the Origin of Species</hi> &#x201C;the most remarkable and original work in its line&#x201D;; his wife had been ordered by her doctor &#x201C;to lead the life of her hundredth million million, million, million Cousin, the Oyster&#x201D; so as not to injure her health &#x201C;by an intemperate use of [her] brains.&#x201D; Although the phrase &#x201C;hundredth million million, million, million Cousin&#x201D; comes from <hi rend="italic">On the Origin of Species</hi> (cf. 420&#x2013;21), Darwin does not refer to oysters specifically; no mention of oysters has been traced in the small number of reviews pbd. before Twisleton&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1860-01-01">1 Jan.</date> The idea of people being descended from oysters is used by reviewers later in <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>. The oyster, as a primitive organism that fossil evidence showed had existed since the earliest times, was used on both sides of the evolutionary argument. It was seen both as something virtually unchanged for millennia, &#x201C;knowing its place&#x201D; in the animal hierarchy, and as a creature constantly able to adapt to differing environments, evolve, and survive. It was also &#x201C;that most familiar of nineteenth century urban street objects&#x201D; (Stott, <hi rend="italic">Oysters</hi> 117), cheap, and eaten in huge quantities by all classes of society, especially the poor (cf. <hi rend="italic">CL</hi> 34:181).

<p>I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> my visit to the Grange, and got no hurt by it, and it was quite pleasant while it lasted.

<salute>Dear James,</salute>
<p>I have been to Mr Bates<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Joshua Bates (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>; <ref target="volume-36/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1678"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), an American banker living in London, partner in the merchant bank Baring Brothers &#x26; Co. since <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>.</note> this afternoon, by appointment, and have talked your matter over;&#x2014;and am very sorry to say there is not the least outlook in that direction.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-36-55" n="36:55"/>The Baring House in Liverpool, it seems, deals mainly or only <hi rend="italic">in Cotton;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baring Brothers had opened an office in Liverpool in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, under the aegis of Joshua Bates, specifically to deal with the cotton trade with the U.S.</note> the Clerks are young men who want to learn that, or other kindred sorts of trade; and <hi rend="italic">they serve without salary at all;</hi> and then go forth on their own score, when sufficiently up to it.</p>
<p>In London, the Junior Clerks have &#x201C;small salaries,&#x201D; Mr Bates says; but they learn nothing whatever: there are Twelve Upper Managers (I know not whether Clerks altogether, or at the same time Partners in some degree, but suppose the latter): these &#x201C;have large salaries, and manage all the business&#x201D;; the juniors sitting under them in a mainly mechanical capacity, copying Letters and the like, and &#x201C;are <hi rend="italic">forbidden to speak</hi>&#x201D; in the Office. Vacancies which occur in the Twelve are filled up, I guess, mainly by <hi rend="italic">relatives</hi> of the House; who, if they ever work in the jun<hi rend="italic">r</hi> department, do it with that view. In short, it is extremely difficult to get in; and, unless you have farther interest, not worth being in when you are. &#x201C;All trade is altered, in London,&#x201D; according to Bates, &#x201C;cut into departments, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> know nothing of each other;&#x2014;a bad system, growing ever worse; and London a bad place for learning it&#x201D;; &#x26;c &#x26;c I need not trouble you with more of this. Mr Bates, I considered it likely, had some real desire to oblige me (perhaps not very much either); and he seemed to like well the Portraiture I made of my Nephew: but the <hi rend="italic">Negative</hi> to my inquiry was visible in every part of his answer. He considered, &#x201C;Such a youth might do a great deal better in Australian life, than in any kind of Mercantile, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was open here; such competition, such&#x201C;&#x2014; I took my hat; thanked politely, and came away.</p>
<p>You may believe how sorry I am, dear James; how gladly I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have helped you, for your own and your brave Father&#x2019;s sake; but I cannot in this way;&#x2014;I would, and will, with very great readiness, in any other that is feasible to you and me. Courage; I guess you will find something to do in the world,&#x2014;or I am much mistaken in the figure of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> and of the world. My best brotherly regards to your Father, my love to every one. <closer><salute>Yours affectionately</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear good M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I cannot put into words how much I feel your kindness. It was such a kind thing to do! and so kindly done!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-36-56" n="36:56"/>My gratitude to you will be as long as my Life; for shall I not, as long as I live, remember that poor little Dog?</p>
<p>Oh dont think me absurd&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">you&#x2014;</hi>for caring so much about a Dog! Nobody but myself can have any idea what that little creature has been in my Life! My inseparable Companion during eleven years, ever doing <hi rend="italic">his</hi> little best to keep me from feeling sad and lonely! Docile, affectionate, loyal up to his last hour&#x2014;when weak and full of pain he <hi rend="italic">offered himself to go out with me,</hi> seeing my bonnet on; and came panting to welcome me on my return! and the reward I gave him&#x2014;the only reward I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to give him&#x2014;to such a pass had things come&#x2014;was, ten minutes after, to give him up to be poisoned!</p>
<p>I thought it not unlikely you would call today&#x2014;because your coming today would be of a piece with the rest of your goodness to me&#x2014; Nevertheless I went out for a long drive&#x2014; I couldn&#x2019;t bear myself in the house, where every thing I looked at reminded me of yesterday. And I wouldn&#x2019;t be at home for visitors, to criticise my swollen eyes and smile at grief &#x201C;about a dog&#x201D;! and besides, suppose <hi rend="italic">you</hi> came, I wished to <hi rend="italic">not</hi> treat you to more tears&#x2014;of which you had had too much&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">today</hi> I couldn&#x2019;t for my life have seen you without crying dreadfully.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I have written to Vernon; shall be extremely glad to despatch his <hi rend="italic">Francke Picture</hi> again, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has done me all the good that was in it, a long while ago. I have again and again had the firm purpose to ask you what the Address was; but always forgot, when we met, and had so many other things to speak of. The Picture has not got, nor shall get if precautions will hinder, any injury; and this unknown young Gent<hi rend="italic">n&#x2019;s</hi> civility to me will always be a pleasant recollection.</p>
<p>I am delighted to hear of you in the woods; or even following the hounds, tho&#x2019; that latter is in a less degree. The hot rooms, the dinings, the assemblages, they are right well away, and no harm done! We expect you &#x201C;the end of this month&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Bath House, Piccadilly, the Ashburtons&#x2019; London home.</note>&#x2014;and one of us expects there may be a ride or two in store, in the bright spring weather.</p>
<p>We cannot brag much here, we for our part; but must not complain. The Wife keeps on foot, stronger than in usual winters lately; I myself am rather below par,&#x2014;and very greatly bothered and hunted by this sad Book of mine; which, like the Siege of Sebastopol to Sir J<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Burgoyne, seems always the more impossible the longer one gazes on it!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir John Fox Burgoyne (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>; <ref target="volume-36/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4014"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), military engineer; in <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date> he proposed an alternative course of action to the direct assault on the Russian fortress of Sebastopol being planned by Lord Raglan.

<p>Mr. Miller, who is now about removing to a better post, has served, these last Eight years, in the London Library, as one of the Clerks there; and, I have reason to believe, has proved himself uniformly an amiable, punctual, polite, diligent and intelligent young man; giving great satisfaction to his Employers. Whatever I, for my part, have happened to know of him is to his advantage.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for the trouble you take. The <hi rend="italic">Francke</hi> has got its new Address put upon it; and shall be (safely, we may hope) in Evans&#x2019;s hands tomorrow. If you hear nothing farther from me, please to consider that such is the case.&#x2014; I understand our man took the crown-royal off altogether (glue not being strong enough, in his opinion); and packed the fragments (all he had of them) in paper,&#x2014;nailing the same to the Box itself, lest they sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get loose in the railway jinglings, and perhaps scratch the Picture. Some more solid finish to that part of the Frame (or indeed mere removal of the crown altogether) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> evidently be advantageous.</p>
<p>There is no doubt but the Picture is <hi rend="italic">an original:&#x2014;</hi>and to enhance and secure whatever worth it may have, I think you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> introduce (fixed, say, on <pb id="pg-36-64" n="36:64"/>the back of the Canvas) that <hi rend="italic">Note</hi> by the Original Proprietor, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is in your Catalogue, and gives the date &#x26;c in an authentic form,&#x2014;needing only <hi rend="italic">your</hi> signature (and the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> date) to make it valid to the present and to future time.&#x2014; That Note was to me an essential part of the interest this Picture excited; and it ought not to be lost.</p>
<p>Francke was not a Painter of eminence, and I think is now pretty much forgotten; but from this Note in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Catalogue, added to what had turned up for me at Berlin, I considered it pretty evident that Francke was, then and there (viz: at Potsdam, <date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s &#x201D;?&#x201D; above the date; the picture was painted about <date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>, when Frederick was 58; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:frontispiece.</note> considered by persons on the spot to have hit off Friedrich well, and to be the man whom an English Nobleman wanting a Portrait of King Fr<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> ought to apply to. That is valuable testimony. And it completely coincides with the fact, so far as I could guess it from this distance of place and time. No likeness in Berlin, except that of Francke&#x2019;s, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> they are now engraving, had the least credibility for me; and I saw the chance of leaving Berlin more <hi rend="italic">un</hi>certain ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> what the Physiognomy of Fr<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had been than I ever was.&#x2014; Friedrich never sat to any Painter after his accession (<date when="1740-00-00">1740</date>, in his 29th year); each had to watch for himself, and pick him up by memory or how he could. The Berlin Artists have now an <hi rend="italic">Orthodox</hi> likeness of F, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> they have tacitly agreed upon, and will produce at once for any comer;&#x2014;and many comers do believe in it; but to me the feat was impossible, and even contemptibly so</p>
<p>My own notion is, Francke comes nearer the real Likeness than anybody yet heard of: and accordingly I am having him <hi rend="italic">engraved</hi> for my own use. This is all I know.&#x2014; Believe me, dear Sir,</p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>If I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> you not to write to, what a remorse it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be that I am so remiss in writing to one that loves me so truly! I have you always to think of, as of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> still left me, faithful while life lasts; and many times that is a consolat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to me when I sadly count to myself how many are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> now here, and how solitary the Scene of Life is fast growing.&#x2014; I have been very slack in writing of late; but truly it is not my <hi rend="italic">blame,</hi> it is my sorrow &#x26; misfortune rather; and I know too you never blame me, but pity me, and hope for a day when I shall be clearer of the burdens that are at present so heavy on me. The truth, however, is, you have not heard from me since before we went to The Grange:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles left for The Grange on <date when="1860-01-05">5 Jan.</date></note> John<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

<p>The truth is, I am pretty much at the bottom of the deep well, these 5 or 6 weeks back; and have seldom, or hardly ever in my life, been in such a pucker,&#x2014;so very near the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of all resources that were visible to me. We <pb id="pg-36-66" n="36:66"/><hi rend="italic">began printing,</hi> you probably heard; and we were <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to stop it again. This includes a whole world of miseries and confusions, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> have tumbled me about at such a rate ever since,&#x2014;rendering the very <hi rend="italic">daylight</hi> a burden to me sometimes! Nor can I yet be said to be <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of the well; very far from it: but I hope I am now down <hi rend="italic">at</hi> the &#x201C;bottom&#x201D;;&#x2014;and there is something generous and encouraging in the tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that one is scrambling upwards. If it please Heaven&#x2019;s Goodness, I shall yet work my way out of this ruin of ruins; and reappear on the green Earth, to a calmer Evening than my Day has been. If it be Heaven&#x2019;s will!&#x2014;</p>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Lady,</hi></salute>
<p>Have you ever noticed how long&#x2014;preternaturally long&#x2014;the time looks, when one had been thinking and feeling more than usual in it, even without changing of place or interrupting of one&#x2019;s outward routine?</p>
<p>I have just been making an experience of this. &#x2026; It wasn&#x2019;t much &#x201C;to speak of.&#x201D; A small tragedy&#x2014;very small&#x2014;and yet, more heart-rending than some grander ones.</p>
<p>My little dog had become rapidly worse, till &#x201C;common humanity required that he should be made away with,&#x201D; I was told. &#x201C;My Dear&#x201D; (urged Mr. C.) &#x201C;it is an Act of Roman Virtue that is demanded of you; <hi rend="italic">and so</hi> (!) you surely will not shrink from it!&#x201C;&#x2014;as if Acts of Roman Virtue were among the simplest ordinary obligations on a nineteenth Century Scotchwoman!&#x2014;and I who have no taste at all for Roman Virtue&#x2014;oh, <hi rend="italic">any</hi> other sort of virtue rather than that! Indeed I have never been able to understand what these old Romans <pb id="pg-36-67" n="36:67"/>could be made of, or to altogether believe in them.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For JWC&#x2019;s story about her childhood admiration for Roman stoicism, see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-simple-story-of-my-own-first-love"><sic>30:191&#x2013;92</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Simple Story</hi></corr></ref>.</note> The appeal to any latent Roman Virtue in <hi rend="italic">me</hi> found nothing to act upon. But the intervention of my Doctor,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Alfred Brooke Barnes.</note> who happened to call, was more effective. He told me the little creature was suffering dreadfully, and would suffer still worse if he lived;&#x2014;that keeping him going on so was &#x201C;a bit of selfishness&#x201D; he wouldn&#x2019;t have given me credit for. And then he asked, suppose he himself should come some day when I was out&#x2014;in a week or so&#x2014;and give the poor dog something to put him out of pain <hi rend="italic">in one moment,</hi> &#x201C;without hurting him the least;&#x201D; would I be very angry? Of course I burst out crying which meant consent. He had said &#x201C;in a week or so,&#x201D; but <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> I knew, was merely to put off apprehension, and accordingly, the very next day, the Dr. in driving past our house, seeing the Drawing room windows open, supposed me gone out; and was half way up stairs, when we met each other face to face. He was for retreating, good kind man; but I felt, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the sooner the better,</hi>&#x201D; the sight of my little dog following one about, trying to discharge his bits of duties the same as ever, in spite of his agony of breathlessness; with my knowledge that he was about to <hi rend="italic">die</hi>&#x2014;to be <hi rend="italic">poisoned;</hi> that the <hi rend="italic">reward</hi> about to be given him, for his lifelong devotion&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> reward that <hi rend="italic">could</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be given him, was&#x2014;prussic acid! Oh it was too horrible, could not be ended too soon. So I called him (the Dr.) back, and said <hi rend="italic">now</hi> was no worse than any other time would be, and bade Charlotte take my little dog away. I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not lift him to put him into her arms, but I kissed his poor little head. And <hi rend="italic">He licked my cheek.</hi></p>
<p>Then I ran and shut myself into my bedroom, and flung myself down and cried&#x2014;as I hadn&#x2019;t cried since I was a girl.</p>
<p>My Dr. kept his promise, the little creature died in <hi rend="italic">one moment</hi> (Charlotte said) without a struggle. Fortunately Mr. Carlyle was himself entirely upset by little Nero&#x2019;s death; so that he could not <hi rend="italic">lecture me</hi> on my &#x201C;excessive grief,&#x201D; his &#x201C;own heart being&#x201D; (as he expressed it) &#x201C;quite <hi rend="italic">unexpectedly</hi> and <hi rend="italic">distractedly</hi> torn to pieces by the misery of the thing.&#x201C;&#x2014; His lyrical recognition of &#x201C;the poor little creature&#x2019;s docility, and loyalty, and sense of duty, and <hi rend="italic">manifold undeniable</hi> merits,&#x201D; interrupted more than once by downright human <hi rend="italic">tears,</hi> might have seemed to some people a fall from his (Mr. C.&#x2019;s) philosophic heights. But for me, I liked him for it more than for all the philosophy that ever came out of his head.</p>
<p>Now, however, already, he speaks of &#x201C;poor Nero&#x201D; very composedly. And Charlotte, who went about, the first two days, with her face swollen and red with weeping, on the third day recovered her prettiness and cheeriness. Only myself whom the little creature belonged to, and whom he loved before <pb id="pg-36-68" n="36:68"/>everybody and everything else, only <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am still horribly sad and <hi rend="italic">perplexed.</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton replied, <date when="1860-02-15">15 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;There is no comfort to be given&#x2014;no words of mine can make up to you for that little beastie&#x2019;s faithfulness, &#x26; love&#x2014;nor its touching loyalty &#x26; trust&#x2014;you have lost a little life, to whom you were the Bright Star&#x2014;poor Beastie! &#x2026; I know all you are feeling&#x2014;I have gone through it all &#x26; people may laugh as they like, but it is <hi rend="italic">a real Grief</hi>&#x2014;a real Loss&#x2014;&#x26; you will every day miss his caresses, &#x26; his loving little ways&#x2014; I am so glad M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle shed good human tears&#x2014;but he is made up of <hi rend="italic">tenderness</hi>&#x2014;that is what I felt most in his Nature&#x2014;tho&#x2019; we scarcely exchanged 20 words&#x2014; I hope some day he will let me know him&#x2014;for I am a good deal in <hi rend="italic">Love</hi>!&#x201D; Emilie Hawkes wrote, <date when="1860-03-09">9 March</date>: &#x201C;Bessie told me of poor dear little Nero&#x2019;s death, and I was truly and deeply grieved for you because I know by experience that few <hi rend="italic">humans</hi> leave behind them such a blank as a dog that has really loved us with all its little limited loving unselfish soul.&#x201D;</note> For, what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> become of that beautiful, engaging little <hi rend="italic">life,</hi> with its &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">manifold undeniable virtues</hi>&#x201D; (as Mr. C. said)? Could these be extinguished, abolished, annihilated by some drops of Prussic Acid? Is <hi rend="italic">that</hi> credible? Is Prussic Acid more powerful than qualities which, found in a <hi rend="italic">Human Being,</hi> the self same qualities&#x2014;we call <hi rend="italic">divine, immortal?</hi> &#x201C;I cannot make myself believe that,&#x201D; I said the other day to Lady William Russell;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Elizabeth Anne Russell, always called Lady William.</note> and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> whom people call &#x201C;so Worldly,&#x201D; (I could never see why), answered&#x2014;&#x201C;But why <hi rend="italic">should</hi> you make yourself believe it, my good Lady? Who does believe it? <hi rend="italic">I</hi> don&#x2019;t.&#x201D; And then she gave me her ideas about the <hi rend="italic">Future</hi> of dogs, which, if not particularly well founded, were so poetical and so sympathetic to me, that I was tempted to jump up and kiss her. Luckily I didn&#x2019;t; for it would have given her a dreadful fright.</p>
<p>All my other visitors have spoken odiously on what they call my &#x201C;little bereavement.&#x201D; They don&#x2019;t conceive what pain they give me. Three several men,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Rev. John Barlow, John George Cooke, and John Forster.</note> the only men I am intimate with here, offered one after another to &#x201C;give me <hi rend="italic">another little dog.</hi>&#x201D; And two women,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> of the sort called &#x201C;full of sensibility,&#x201D; inquired if I had &#x201C;had him <hi rend="italic">stuffed</hi>?&#x201D; &#x201C;I wonder you didn&#x2019;t&#x201D; said one of them plaintively, &#x201C;he would have looked <hi rend="italic">so</hi> pretty in a glass case in your room, and still been quite a companion to you.&#x201D; Merciful Heavens! If one lived in what Mr. Carlyle calls &#x201C;a sincere age of the world,&#x201D; wouldn&#x2019;t one take such a Comforter as <hi rend="italic">that</hi> by the neck and pitch her out at the window?</p>
<p>The frank indifference of one&#x2019;s fellow-creatures, that is a common complaint. But it is not <hi rend="italic">that</hi> one suffers most from; their so called sympathy is often far worse to bear.</p>
<p>But why, you think, in the name of wonder, do I write always to <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> my Lady? I know well enough why. It is because the Heavenly kindness in your eyes and voice, when we talked about my little dog at the Grange, has come back to me many times since, and <hi rend="italic">magnetises</hi> me into these strange confidences. <pb id="pg-36-69" n="36:69"/>But understand, I have no expectation that you should <hi rend="italic">answer</hi> such a letter as this. If you read it to an end without protest it is as much as could be asked. Someday however when you have much leisure perhaps you will write me two or three lines, just to say how you feel, and when you come to Town, and how the dear wee Baby is.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Florence Baring was b. <date when="1860-06-26">26 June</date>.</note></p>
   <p>I heard from &#x201C;St. Thomas&#x201D; a few days since.

<salute>Oh you dear nice People!</salute>
<p>I am so glad! so obliged to you!

<p>Yesterday, it was quite another story! Closely following on the Postman&#x2019;s ring, the strange creature burst into my room, her eyes dancing in her head, her cheeks like roses (very pretty my maid is!) and holding out in one hand the <hi rend="italic">big letter,</hi> and in the other an opened envelope with some fluttery paper thing hanging to it, she cried; &#x201C;Here they are! A Valentine <hi rend="italic">for both of us!</hi> and mine is <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a pretty one! I hope yours will be as pretty!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;My dear Child, I said, what nonsense!&#x2014; A <hi rend="italic">Valentine&#x2014;</hi>for <hi rend="italic">me!&#x2014;</hi> Come let me see yours; mine, I can tell before opening it, is nothing but the Photograph I ordered from Caldesis&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600206-JWC-RST-01">JWC to RST, [ca. <date when="1860-02-06">6 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note> And thereupon I took the big letter, and <hi rend="italic">rather sadly</hi> tossed it on the sofa, and fell to lyrical recognition of the love knots, and doves, and orange blossoms, and other captivating details of the girl&#x2019;s Valentine, which was really a most elaborate one! had cost half-a-crown at the least!&#x2014; &#x201C;Now if <hi rend="italic">we</hi> only knew who it is from!&#x201D; said the girl; &#x201C;I thought at first of the young man in the City who wrote me the stupid letter; but it cant be from <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">he</hi> knows my name, and this, see; is addressed to <hi rend="italic">Miss Charlotte</hi> Whoever sent it hasn&#x2019;t known to put <hi rend="italic">Southam&#x2014;Miss Charlotte at M</hi>rs <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; And she turned to me the direction on the envelope. I smiled&#x2014;for the handwriting was a revealation. &#x201C;Oh it is from <hi rend="italic">you!</hi>&#x201D; cried the girl quick to read my looks. &#x201C;No not from me&#x2014;but I think I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> who sent it.&#x201D; &#x201C;Do, do tell me then.&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Well I think the handwriting is M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barlows<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. John Barlow.</note> a little disguised.&#x201D; Whereupon my young Lady commenced dancing something like a hornpipe in the room, and singing a song of triumph to it! (an odd servant to have; don&#x2019;t you think? but she just suits me!) And really a <hi rend="italic">Valentine</hi> from the &#x201C;Chaplain to Prince Albert,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Secretary to <hi rend="italic">the Royal Institution,</hi>&#x201D; and one of the best gentlemen in London <hi rend="italic">was</hi> something to turn the head of a little Maidservant; altho&#x2019;, the discovery of the Authorship took away all significance from the <hi rend="italic">orange blossoms</hi> (at least) M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barlow being an elderly married man.</p>
<p>You may think that elderly married men here, especially such as clap <hi rend="italic">Rev</hi>d on their cards and are <hi rend="italic">F R S</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fellow of the Royal Society.</note> besides, might be more fitly employed than in paying &#x201C;delicate attentions&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580716-JWC-TC-01"><sic>34:50</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1858-07-16">16 July 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note> to a servant girl&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">however pretty!</hi>&#x2014; But it may be said, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> think, of this as of most other questionabilities in the world; <hi rend="italic">c&#x2019;est selon</hi> [that depends]!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410710-JWC-TC-01"><sic>13:179</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1841-07-10">10 July 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> In this case, the delicate attention was meant as much for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> as for her (if that make the thing any more seemly!) and then,&#x2014;my goodness!&#x2014;there was an amount of good nature,&#x2014;of real human kindliness in it, enough to cover a multitude of such infringements of the Ceremonial <pb id="pg-36-71" n="36:71"/>Law&#x2014;&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">the three thousand punctualities</hi>&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571024-JWC-AHO-01"><sic>33:104</sic><corr>JWC to AHO, <date when="1857-10-24">24 Oct. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> (as the Chinese call it).&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barlow had chanced to call here on that Valentine&#x2019;s day a year ago, when Charlotte had been so disappointed, and I had repeated to him her na&#xEF;ve little words. He had remembered them till another valentine&#x2019;s day came round, and determined that this time she should have her hearts desire, and I for her.</p>
<p>Now all the while my big letter lay on the sofa unheeded. &#x201C;Just look at yours Mam,&#x201D; said Charlotte at last, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> am by no means sure it isn&#x2019;t a Valentine after all!&#x201D; So to please her I took it up and was proceeding to break the seals when I saw the postmark <hi rend="italic">Haddington!</hi> &#x201C;Good gracious&#x201C;&#x2014;I exclaimed&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">There!</hi> I <hi rend="italic">told</hi> you&#x2014;&#x201D;! said Charlotte&#x2014; Very quickly, <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> I extricated the photograph&#x2014;and found it as far as possible from being come &#x201C;from Caldesis&#x201D;! If I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> still have danced a hornpipe it was now my turn to have done it; my enthusiasm having risen as high as the girls!&#x2014;</p>
<p>And god knows it was very good for me, to have a little bit of gladness thus unexpectedly provided me&#x2014;if it had been only to give a change to the train of thought I had been living and having my being in, since the death of the loyalest most devoted little companion and friend that ever woman had and lost&#x2014;my dear little dog!&#x2014; If you never had a dog, either of you, your friend thro all his life (eleven years) you cannot have any sympathy or even perhaps any patience, with the sorrow I feel over mine&#x2014;so just pass over the cause of the sorrow&#x2014;whether it be what is called &#x201C;a legitimate sorrow&#x201D; or not&#x2014;and think; that you have come and comforted me a bit, when I was sorrowful!</p>
<p>As for the portraits <hi rend="italic">per se,</hi> they are very like&#x2014;but very far from flattering.

No smearing of ones fingers, as if one had been with them to the <hi rend="italic">Land of Canaan</hi> of which the Child said, &#x201C;Oh Mama! <hi rend="italic">how</hi> sticky&#x201D;! (on being told it &#x201C;flowed with milk and honey&#x201D;)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Exod. 3:8.</note>&#x2014; Actually out of all these dozens of eggs there was not <hi rend="italic">one</hi> wasted! <hi rend="italic">Two</hi> were broken but not spilt&#x2014;and are already down my individual throat in form of a refection called <hi rend="italic">Zambaio.</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Zabaglione; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590517-TC-LS-01"><sic>35:95&#x2013;96</sic><corr>TC to LS, <date when="1859-05-17">17 May 1859</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-35/18590520-TC-JC-01"><sic>35:95&#x2013;96</sic><corr>TC to JC, <date when="1859-05-20">20 May 1859</date></corr></ref>.</note> Two others were slightly chipped, and behold all the damage! Clearly <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the right way to pack eggs! <hi rend="italic">plenty of hay,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">all by themselves.</hi> Much thanks dear Mary, from us both.</p>
<p>For the rest; we are &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">thankful</hi> to say that we are in our <hi rend="italic">frail ordinar</hi>&#x201D; (as my illegitimate cousin<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Amelia (&#x201C;Jackie&#x201D;) Welsh.</note> at Haddington expresses herself). And in truth <hi rend="italic">even that</hi> gets to be something to feel very thankful for; after having come thro so many dreary crisises of illness as I have done of late years. Except for three weeks in <date when="1859-11-00">November</date> I have not been confined to the house thro all this severe winter. I never go out after dusk; but on days when there is no fall&#x2014;of &#x201C;old wives&#x201D; or anything, I usually go out in &#x201C;a Fly&#x201D; or an Omnibus, or on foot even, for a couple of hours in the middle of the day, which is a great improvement on the four preceding winters and helps to keep up my heart in this weary passage thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">The Valley of the Shadow of Frederick the Great!&#x2014;</hi> Whom I am as sick of as I ever was of any thing in this world.</p>
<p>And his unlucky Biographer, would, I dare say, tell the same story.</p>
<p>Have you heard that my little Nero is dead? You saw the little creature once at Scotsbrig; but you, with your family of handsome daughters,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary and James Austin had eight das.</note> can have no idea, the least [in the]<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Inserted by TC later; TC also added: &#x201C;[<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>, <hi rend="italic">Nero</hi>&#x2F;ah dear!].&#x201D;</note> world, how fond we had become of that bit Dog. Not I only, who dont set up for having any &#x201C;sound sense&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">to speak of;</hi> but M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C too! He was such an affectionate, loyal, <hi rend="italic">dutiful</hi> little creature! &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">No den[y]ing his manifold virtues</hi>&#x201D;! (as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C said of him after his death) and he had been inseparable from me for eleven years!&#x2014;and during his long illness, the patience and gentleness he showed; and the struggles he made to show his poor little love, and do all his bits of duties up to the last hour were not the less touching but I should say the more touching because he was not <hi rend="italic">human,</hi> &#x201C;only a dog&#x201D; (as people say). I assure you Mr C <hi rend="italic">cried</hi> on the day of his death!&#x2014;the particulars of which I would rather not dwell on&#x2014;so no wonder at <hi rend="italic">my</hi> being upset. Charlotte too went about for three days with her face swollen and red with weeping. It was a luck for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> that <hi rend="italic">others</hi> were so affected; for it was the means of sparing me a great deal of unendurable good advice and remonstrance on the &#x201C;irrationality&#x201D; of my grief. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C naively remarked&#x2014;&#x201C;My Dear! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> cannot <hi rend="italic">rebuke</hi> you; for my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> heart is most <hi rend="italic">unexpectedly</hi> and <pb id="pg-36-73" n="36:73"/><hi rend="italic">distractedly</hi> torn to pieces with the misery of the thing&#x201D;!&#x2014; That is it you see! What people dont happen to feel <hi rend="italic">themselves,</hi> they disapprove of and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">rebuke</hi>&#x201D; others for feeling. When they feel the same themselves it is all right.</p>
<p>Imagine! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C got a <hi rend="italic">Valentine</hi> on the 14<hi rend="italic">th!</hi> the first Valentine he ever got in his life, he says!&#x2014; He is beginning!&#x2014;and the nature of the Valentine was as extraordinary as the idea of sending one to <hi rend="italic">him.</hi> It was a handsomely &#x201C;got up&#x201D; little <hi rend="italic">English Prayer Book!!</hi> with some verses of Scripture in a sprawling female hand<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> on the Fly leaf&#x2014;and on the cover&#x201D;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">A Valentine for dear Carlyle</hi></p>
<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">On whom may God&#x2019;s great glories smile</hi>&#x201D;</p>

<salute>My dear Eliza</salute>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> think the Devil has taken your visits here under his especial charge! To think of your again coming in vain&#x2014;so early too!&#x2014; There is one practical inference to be drawn that I should <hi rend="italic">never</hi> represent myself as findable at <pb id="pg-36-74" n="36:74"/>certain hours; the fact being that, at this season of the year, I am what old Thomas Erskine called one of the Lady Oglvies,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC is probably referring to the four das. of David Ogilvy (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), 6th earl of Airlie, and Clementina Drummond Ogilvy (d. <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>): Jean Graham Drummond (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1902-00-00">1902</date>), Clementina Drummond (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">48</date>), Maria Anne (<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">93</date>), and Helen Susanna Catherine Gertrude (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>).</note>&#x2014;&#x201C;an extremely <hi rend="italic">accidental</hi> sort of young woman&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>When I came home the other day Charlotte received me with &#x201C;Oh Dear! Countess Pepoli &#x2018;has been here and was in such a passion&#x2019;!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Passion! at what?&#x201D; &#x201C;Why she said you had told her you always dined at 3! and then M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barlow came and showed me his watch and made it repeat 4 (such a curious watch!) and said; &#x201C;there! you see it is half past 4, and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle told me she never staid out later than 4!&#x201D;</p>
<p>But how can I help it&#x2014;living in a conditional world?&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">regular,</hi> and I aim at keeping times&#x2014;but alas! one&#x2019;s &#x201C;wishes are &#x201C;not&#x201D; presentiments of one&#x2019;s powers!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of JWC&#x2019;s phrases; cf. <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430313-TC-UC-01"><sic>16:82</sic><corr>TC to UC, <date when="1843-03-13">13 March 1843</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540301-JWC-WA-01"><sic>29:36</sic><corr>JWC to WA, <date when="1854-03-01">1 March 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note> tho&#x2019; it is so pretended by conceited moralists!</p>

<p>Instead of writing I would have gone to Craven Hill<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza&#x2019;s mother, Betty Donaldson, lived at 21 Craven Hill, Bayswater.</note> on Monday had I not been engaged to the Rennies at York Terrace<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George and Jane Rennie lived at 32 York Ter., Regent&#x2019;s Park.</note>&#x2014;but I will try to find you soon&#x2014; The news Charlotte gave me of Miss Donaldson seemed to good to be true&#x2014; Oh my Goodness!

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>If you are going to make a jacket, the sooner you have the pattern the better<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had offered to send a pattern of the jacket she had made; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600128-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1860-01-28">28 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;for the sooner you <hi rend="italic">begin,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know, you will be the sooner ended. So I won&#x2019;t put off more time, waiting for a day of leisure enough to write you a good long letter; but take my chances of interruption, which are rather many just now&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wish I was beside you, to help you with the jacket; in the way of delivering a lecture on the paper illustration, you will need <hi rend="italic">some</hi> directions and I must <pb id="pg-36-76" n="36:76"/><pb id="pg-36-77" n="36:77"/>give them as well as I can at this distance In the first place, a reflective woman like you must have noticed without telling that the effect of these jackets, so popular of late years, depends mostly on the <hi rend="italic">trimming.</hi> If your jacket is to be of <hi rend="italic">black</hi> material it should either be trimmed with a <hi rend="italic">colour</hi> or with <hi rend="italic">jet</hi> or something to make a marked contrast to the body of the thing. The one I made of black silk is corded all round with scarlet silk and then, about half an inch from the edge, a tartan velvet ribbon is run on plain&#x2014; That sounds intelligible enough? But you must further observe that the seam which joins the front part to the side should be left open for about two inches at the bottom (you will see where I have put crosses on the paper) and then your ribbon, or whatever trimming you use, must be conducted neatly round the opening&#x26;colon; The sleeves should have the seam turned more to the front, about an inch, than is usual in the sleeves of a gown, and left open to within some three inches of the top&#x2014;having a row of small buttons on one side and loops on the other to close it up if required The same process of cording and trimming is &#x201C;carried out&#x201D; of course on the sleeve&#x2014;but the trimming must be taken <hi rend="italic">up</hi> the sleeve on both sides of the seam as well as <hi rend="italic">round</hi> the sleeve. Decidedly my talent does not lie in the way of drawing for <hi rend="italic">The Magazine of Fashion!</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For JWC&#x2019;s diagrams that illustrate her meaning, see <sic>opp</sic><corr>above</corr>.; JWC&#x2019;s first diagram is below, her second above.</note> <hi rend="italic">That</hi> my Dear is meant for the side of the sleeve turned to the public&#x2014; And now God be with you and good speed to you!</p>

<p>For the rest; I am still not laid up, but going out for a drive twice a week and sometimes for a short walk But if I am less ill than usual this winter, I am more than usually sorrowful. For I have lost my dear little companion of eleven years standing. My little Nero is dead. And the grief his death has caused me has been wonderful even to myself. His Patience, and gentleness, and loving struggle to do all his bits of duties under his painful illness, up to the last hour of his life, was very strange and touching to see, and had so endeared him to every body in the House, that I was happily spared all reproaches for &#x201C;wasting so much feeling on <hi rend="italic">a dog.</hi>&#x201D; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C couldnt reproach me; for he himself was in tears at the poor little things end! and his own heart (as he phrased it) was &#x201C;most <hi rend="italic">unexpectedly</hi> and <hi rend="italic">distractedly</hi> torn to pieces with it&#x201C;&#x2014; As for Charlotte she went about for three days after with her face all swollen and red with weeping. But on the fourth day she got back her good looks and gay spirits&#x2014;and much sooner M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had got to speak of &#x201C;poor Nero&#x201D; composedly enough! Only to <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> whom he belonged to, and whom he preferred to all living, does my dear wee dog remain a constantly recurring blank, and a thought of strange sadness! What is become of that little beautiful graceful <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> so full of love and loyalty and sense of duty, up to the last moment that it animated the body of that little dog? Is <hi rend="italic">it</hi> to be extinguished, <pb id="pg-36-78" n="36:78"/>abolished, annihilated in an instant; while the brutalized, two legged, socalled <hi rend="italic">human</hi> creature who dies in a ditch, after having outraged all duties, and caused nothing but pain and disgust to all concerned with him, is to live forever? It is impossible for me to believe that!&#x2014; I couldn&#x2019;t help saying so in writing to my Aunt Grace<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grace Welsh.</note> and expected a terrible lecture for it&#x2014; But not so! Grace, who had been fond of my little dog, couldn&#x2019;t find in her heart to speak unkindly on his subject&#x2014;nay actually gave me a reference to certain verses in Romans which &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">seemed</hi>&#x201D; to warrant my belief in the immortality of animal life as well as human<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Rom. 8:21&#x2013;39.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>The thing is <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> anyhow; my little dog is buried at the top of our garden&#x2014;and I grieve for him as if he had been my little human child.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine Jewsbury wrote to Walter Mantell, <date when="1860-03-10">10 March</date>: &#x201C;Poor Mrs Carlyle has lost Nero w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a great sorrow.&#x201D; Edward Sterling &#x201C;took her the most charming little dog to console her &#x26; she refused it&#x201D; (MS: Mantell 85:322:2).</note></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Last night the Postman duly delivered me your Letter of the 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> ult., with its valuable inclosures;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Writing from New York, <date when="1860-02-10">10 Feb.</date>, Butler sent TC a check for &#xa3;42 12s. 6d., together with a certificate of purchase for $5,000 worth of bonds of the Chicago &#x26; North Western Railway Co., bought for TC, <date when="1859-08-01">1 Aug. 1859</date>. Butler had explained, <date when="1859-08-17">17 Aug. 1859</date>: &#x201C;Hereafter your interest will accrue on <date when="1860-02-01">1 Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date> &#x26; <date when="1860-08-01">1 Aug</date><hi rend="italic">t</hi> 7% on $7000 &#x2026; $245 each semi annual remittance&#x201D; (Kimball 288).</note> all perfectly exact and as they should be. You are a model of punctuality; and certainly have been and are the kindest and wisest of Managers in these matters for me. It is also, to my imagination if not otherwise, a considerable solace that you now send a visible and tangible Paper Document with a red star on it: this I can lock henceforth in a safe drawer; and leave the matter to sleep, with entire composure upon it, as a thing fixed like the old rocks. Again permit me to thank you very much;&#x2014;and to say that when I get more money, you shall again be asked to lay it by for me.</p>
<p>We probably got some benefit out of our long Scotch rustication last year:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1859-10-03">3 Oct. 1859</date>: &#x201C;Returned Saturday night [<date when="1859-10-01">1 Oct.</date>] &#x2026; from a long miscellaneous sojourn in Scotland &#x2026; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has lasted very idly, and not too comfortably since the last days of <date when="1859-00-00">June</date>. &#x2026; Bathing, solitary riding, walking. &#x2026; Perhaps both of us are a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> better; one cannot hope, much&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:236). See also <ref target="volume-35/lt-18591003-TC-JAC-01"><sic>35:223&#x2013;24</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1859-10-03">3 Oct. 1859</date></corr></ref>.</note> at least my Wife has been perceptibly better all thro&#x2019; Winter; and has never (till just now, I hope only slightly) had one fit of cold, which used to be so unkind to her.

I dare not set any time; but it seems to me always, if I could hold out about another twelvemonth, I might see myself freed from the most intolerable millstone that was ever hung round a poor creature&#x2019;s neck,&#x2014;and sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> thenceforth swim with a great deal more of buoyancy and levity till I got to port. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Hope</hi> springs eternal in the human breast,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Alexander Pope, &#x201C;An Essay on Man&#x201D; 1:95.</note>&#x2014;this is indeed the &#x201C;Place of Hope.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Tarr, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 121.</note> All people are greatly agog about Gladstone&#x2019;s Budget;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Butler wrote, <date when="1860-02-10">10 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;it seems to me as if the Emperor &#x2026; would give &#x2026; a mighty impulse to commercial and industrial activities throughout Europe&#x2014;that his programme of reform, in abolishing or modifying the restrictive &#x26; prohibitory system which has so fettered France and establishing such free interchange with England will earn for him greater fame than all his great battles&#x201D; (Kimball 289&#x2013;90). Gladstone&#x2019;s budget speech, <date when="1860-02-10">10 Feb.</date>, dealt with a commercial treaty with France, to be in force for ten years, in which France engaged &#x201C;to reduce the duty on English coal and coke &#x2026; pig-iron and steel &#x2026; on tools and machinery &#x2026; and on yarn and goods in flax and hemp&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Hansard</hi> 832). In exchange England engaged &#x201C;to reduce the duty on brandy &#x2026; [and] on foreign wine&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Hansard</hi> 834). Defending the treaty, Gladstone argued, &#x201C;What we have done is good&#x2014;nay, doubly good,&#x2014;good for ourselves if France had done nothing at all, doubly good because France has done a great deal&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Hansard</hi> 843).</note>&#x2014;interested too, as I frequently notice, that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have at last got &#x201C;a Speaker&#x201D; (may <hi rend="italic">he</hi> speak to the purpose!) after so long waiting.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Pennington (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>), Republican congressman from New Jersey, was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives, <date when="1860-02-01">1 Feb.</date>, after two months of bitter debate and 44 ballots.

<salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>
<p>The door had no sooner closed on you than the maid brought in her Cigar Box,&#x2014;the Third I have had from that cornucopia of a House: a shame to think of! This is what may be called <hi rend="italic">cigarring</hi> a man for his difficult adventure, as they talk of &#x201C;Coaling&#x201D; a Steamer to go thro&#x2019; high seas. Fact is, I am not yet half way thro&#x2019; the First Box; tho&#x2019; I carry something of it daily in my pocket; and the Horse of himself pauses at the fit places, inviting me to smoke and be thankful. I can only say, and think, you are very good.</p>
<p>The new <hi rend="italic">D&#xfc;rer</hi> is hung up in fine light, and I study to make acquaintance with it before it return home. The invincible grave simple <hi rend="italic">Ritter,</hi> industriously riding on his way,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin had lent TC a copy of an engraving by Albrecht D&#xfc;rer, German painter and engraver, &#x201C;Ritter, Tod, und Teufel [Knight, Death, and Devil]&#x201D; (<date when="1513-00-00">1513</date>). Ruskin described the knight: &#x201C;He rides quietly, his bridle firm in his hand, and his lips set close in a slight sorrowful smile, for he hears what Death is saying; and hears it as the word of a messenger who brings pleasant tidings, thinking to bring evil ones&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Modern Painters</hi> [<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">60</date>] 5:243). Geraldine Jewsbury presumably saw the print, as she wrote to Walter Mantell, <date when="1860-01-18">18 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;Carlyle is grim as Albert D&#xfc;rers Knight riding thro&#x2019; the forest &#x26; dogged by Devils&#x2014;he is ill to live with just now Frederick does so disagree with him&#x201D; (MS: Mantell 85:322:3).</note> with such a load of sorrow wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he makes not the least complaint of, pleases me more and more;&#x2014;less and less am I pleased with his two detestable companions;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Beside him, but a little in advance, rides Death on a pale horse. &#x2026; Behind him follows Sin; but Sin is powerless; he has been conquered and passed by, but follows yet&#x201D; (Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Modern Painters</hi> 5:243).</note> who, I incline to think, lie beyond and below the real domain of Art, tho&#x2019; they are very true to Nature too, and attend every man, tragically visible to <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> if <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to others. The Picture I guess to have no other meaning than that universal symbolical one.&#x2014; Of the other <hi rend="italic">D&#xfc;rers</hi> which you shewed us,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin wrote to JWC, [<date when="1859-12-03">3 Dec. 1859</date>]: &#x201C;I have been looking over my Durer&#x2019;s and find an impression of the melancholia &#x2026; [and] can only <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> Mr. Carlyle may think it worth placing in a house where so much noble work has been done. &#x2026; The next time I come, I will bring a number of Durers with me, to look over&#x2014;I am so selfish as to want to hear what Mr. Carlyle says of them.&#x201D; D&#xfc;rer was one of the first artists to portray melancholy as philosophical and artistic suffering rather than just miserable laziness. JWC evidently appreciated the engraving, as a few days later Ruskin wrote: &#x201C;I am so very glad you liked the things &#x2026; for indeed the Melancholy is not exactly likeable. What it means&#x2014;no one <hi rend="italic">knows</hi>. &#x2018;Cavernous meaning&#x2019; is just the word for it. &#x2F; In the main, it evidently means the full sense of the terror-mystery&#x2014;turmoil&#x2014;responsibility of the world, ending in great awe &#x26; sadness&#x2014;and perpetual labour. &#x2026; Strong bodied.

<p><salute>My dear &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Grace Rennie</hi>&#x201D; of long ago&#x2014;</salute> It must be something like 40 years since I saw your sweet face or had any exchange of words with you! Still I recollect you well and kindly&#x2014; I wonder if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have any recollection of <hi rend="italic">me?</hi> Of the little Jeanie Welsh you were all so kind to, and your nephew George so much in love with?&#x2014; At least you will recollect my name, and the fact of my <pb id="pg-36-86" n="36:86"/>existence when recalled to you by this letter and you will recollect my beautiful Mother, who was so fond of you!</p>
<p>Well-after all this lifetime I am writing to you! Not to recall <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> to your mind, but to tell you what you ought to be told&#x2014;not merely officially, but with some words of sympathy and detail. George&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">your</hi> George Rennie and <hi rend="italic">my</hi> George Rennie is dead! died yesterday morning at six o&#x2019;clock,&#x2014;having been insensible from the previous sunday. By a strange fatality it was I who watched by him thro&#x2019; his last night on Earth! I, his first love, who received his last breath and closed his eyes! Was it not a strange sad thing! After so many <pb id="pg-36-87" n="36:87"/>separations&#x2014;so many tossings up and down this weary weary<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word repeated on turn of page.</note> earth! His wife wrote to me on Tuesday that he was at the point of death and I &#x201C;as his oldest friend should know it.&#x201D; God bless her for that thought&#x2014;death abolishes all forms and ceremonies; so I went to her at once, and begged to be let stay&#x2014;She granted my petition; indeed, she was quite worn out with sleeplessness and anxiety, and was needing the help of one [who]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently omitted by JWC, because omitted on copy and bracketed in Ireland, <hi rend="italic">JWC</hi>.</note> could give it with such fellow feeling as I could&#x2014; After that I never left him till all was over&#x2014; He never was conscious for an instant,&#x2014;but still it was a satisfaction to have <hi rend="italic">been with him</hi> at the last. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Rennie begged me to stay <hi rend="italic">with her;</hi> she was so desolate! tho&#x2019; she bears up bravely&#x2014;and I was willing for his sake to be of any earthly use to her, so long as my husband will spare me from my own house.</p>

<p>If I saw you I could tell you much about George, that you would like to hear&#x2014;but just now I am so sorrowful and tired, that I must content myself with saying, tho&#x2019; he kept up no intercourse with his relations it was not from a cold or changed heart&#x2014;a few weeks before his death I spoke to him about that part of his conduct which displeased me, and found <hi rend="italic">that pride, reserve,</hi> his soured temper about the world was at the bottom of it all<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18591130-JWC-WDO-01">JWC to <sic>WD</sic><corr>WDO</corr>, [<date when="1859-11-30">30 Nov. 1859</date>].</ref></note>&#x2014;he spoke affectionately of his Aunt Grace and said he would take take<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word repeated on turn of page.</note> the first opportunity of going to see her&#x2014;&#x201C;would do many things too long neglected could he only get rid of these depressing headaches that made his life miserable&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I think you will like to know this was his intention tho&#x2019; never to be fulfilled! and I offered to Richard<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Temple Rennie.</note> to write the letter he would else have written himself to tell you of his Father&#x2019;s death&#x2014;that along with the news you might receive the comfort to your good heart&#x2014;(It cannot have changed from the heart I knew it) which the assurance of his Kind feeling towards you is calculated to give and which I only, perhaps, had heard from him. Never was there a man, as I told him then, who did himself more injustice&#x2014; I believe he had the <hi rend="italic">warmest,</hi> truest heart, but it was incased in pride &#x26; distrust of others affection for him making it of no use to them or himself.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC apparently also wrote to Thomas Erskine about George Rennie&#x2019;s death, as Erskine wrote to her, <date when="1860-07-04">4 July</date>: &#x201C;It is the most tender &#x26; touching romance I ever heard&#x2014;I wish he had had five minutes consciousness&#x2014;he might have thought that all the intermediated history was a dream, &#x26; that he had been all along living a quite different life. &#x2026; What strange things these lives of ours are! &#x2026; that you should be the sole human witness of the ebbing out of that breath! &#x2026; one asks why was this so arranged by the great arranger?&#x2014;There is something most intensely sweet &#x26; sad in it.&#x201D;</note></p>

<p>I should need no &#x201C;tempting,&#x201D; I should need only permitting; were it not, alas, that I am in the House of Bondage, and tied hand and foot. The Printer <pb id="pg-36-89" n="36:89"/>is upon me,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained, as TC had claimed to have stopped printing in Feb.; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600203-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, [<date when="1860-02-03">3 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;worse than any Pharoah;&#x2014;and daily there is the tale of bricks to do, not so much as <hi rend="italic">stubble</hi> procurable,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Exod. 5; see also <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590107-TC-JN-01"><sic>35:7</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1859-01-07">7 Jan 1859</date></corr></ref>.</note> for most part!&#x2014; My life is dark, and a burden, these many years, with an unprofitable, hideously undoable Task; and the rule has to be, &#x201C;Either die or get it done.&#x201D; Inch by inch, it surely will one day be got shoved away;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">then,</hi> like Sicily from Enceladus<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Enceladus, wounded giant of Greek mythology, buried under Mt.

This seems poetic description; but it is more sadly prosaic and allied to fact than you are aware of.</p>
<p>For above a week, the accompany-volume<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I picked from a stall not long since) has lain wrapt up for you,&#x2014;in hopes your Highland heart might leap up into some interest over it here and there, if you would consent to read it. There wanted only the three words of Note to write along with it;&#x2014;and there it has lain till now. Judge of the hurry I am kept in;&#x2014;and how this black element has <hi rend="italic">demoralised</hi> me, almost into total worthlessness; unable to write three simple words!&#x2014; Read the old Book at y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> leisure, I advise,&#x2014;or his Lordship and you together;&#x2014;there is a strange meaning for one, in those poor old <hi rend="italic">indubitabilities</hi> of domestic <hi rend="italic">fact,</hi> scattered like live sparks in the void Night of Time past.</p>

Talk having arisen about an abortive search for engravings of Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s seats, he took down a volume of &#x2018;Beauties of England and Wales,&#x2019; and read part of the description of Highclere, which becomes so rapturous over the charming scenery that we all laughed. &#x2026; His face was a good study while he read, wearing no spectacles, shadows thrown on one cheek, bushy eyebrows, moustache and beard masking the massive underlip. A cheerful tone of voice, the more reason by its occasional manifestations of native Scottish&#x201D; (Walter White, <hi rend="italic">The Journals of Walter White</hi> [<date when="1898-00-00">1898</date>] 130&#x2013;31).

<p>I have not seen your &#x201C;Henry&#x201D; nor heard of him.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grace Dinning&#x2019;s son, Henry.</note> Please to give him my address yourself (it is written at the top of this sheet) I daresay they would <pb id="pg-36-91" n="36:91"/>not give themselves much trouble about it at York Terrace.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rennies&#x2019; house.</note>&#x2014; Tell him moreover that <hi rend="italic">after four</hi> is the surest time for finding me and that a Chelsea Omnibus will bring him to within a few yards of my door&#x2014; I shall like so much to see him!</p>
<p>I would have stayed with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Rennie till after the funeral, if I had not felt myself falling ill, But I was warned by a beginning of sore throat, on Saturday, to get home before worse befell me and the apprehensions which the mere mention of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">sorethroat</hi>&#x201D; inspired her with, made M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Rennie more than willing to let me go. So I returned home on Saturday afternoon, and having devoted the two following days to a sick headache, which the sorethroat had turned to. I went back to York Terrace on Tuesday to see if I were still needed; No! Not at all! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Rennie&#x2019;s mood had veered round in the interval from soft to hard; her wants were no longer such as I could supply nor her topics such as I could sympathise in, So having merely helped her to <hi rend="italic">put on her weeds</hi> (a strange service from me to her! as strange as all the rest of this sad business!) I left, with the feeling that having now exhausted the mutual excitement which had drawn us <hi rend="italic">together;</hi> brought two such antipathetic natures as hers and <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> into a quasi-sympathy: we might drop away into the old distance from one another&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">with advantage to both!</hi> Dear Grace, the things that are in my heart &#x26; memory about poor George, would find more response from <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> I am sure, than from <hi rend="italic">her:</hi> and some day we shall surely meet, to have a long talk about him. I dont know whether I shall be going to Scotland this year: I was not minded to go, having spent all last summer there; and my Husband being too busy with his Book for taking any holyday at all this coming summer. But a new motive for going has arisen which <hi rend="italic">may</hi> perhaps overcome the motives for staying at home. You remember Sunny-Bank and the Miss Donaldson&#x2019;s? My Mother&#x2019;s ever kind, most trusted friends.

It was indeed no common kindness you did me when you advised me so amply and showed me in such a pure womanly way the difficulties of your own past path that I might take courage to walk patiently and hopefully on mine.

It is a laborious life and one not very congenial to the cultivation of literary gifts but I get through it an independent livelihood. &#x2026; As to my poetry though I can never write as I wish I cannot give it up.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>The other night John read to me a Letter of yours to Jean, which had been sent hither from Dumfries for our use; and was very welcome after the long silence. You give us there a fine lively account of your dear Household over the Sea; the whole matter came home to me, and I thought of you my Brother ever true to me, and far away, struggling handsomely on, tho&#x2019; growing old, like others of us: in short it brought up such a vivid picture of the present, and the past, and was so wholesome and agreeable in its simplicity of truth, I privately determined to go and do at once a thing I had long intended, but had put off for want of time,&#x2014;namely to send you the Bit of Paper wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is now <pb id="pg-36-95" n="36:95"/>here inclosed,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC enclosed &#xa3;50 (TC&#x2019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).</note> as a small memorial of my regard for you wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will live as it ought so long as I live. Dear Brother, you may believe me, it is years since I had such a pleasure as in sending you this little gift. It will <hi rend="italic">ditt</hi> up some little hole in your establishment perhaps, and keep the wind out, as if by my command, Brother Tom&#x2019;s command; and no man can be more welcome to a thing than Brother Alick is to this.&#x2014;&#x2014; I am not now so scarce of money as I used to be, nor indeed scarce at all, within the last few years; we have, on the contrary, an <hi rend="italic">increasing</hi> stock,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had just received &#xa3;521 12s. from Chapman &#x26; Hall, &#x201C;being the amount due to me for the royalty and use of the stereotype plates for my works printed from <date when="1859-01-01">Jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1</date> to <date when="1859-12-31">Dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 31 1859</date>&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s receipt, signed and dated &#x201C;5 Cheyne Row Chelsea, <date when="1860-04-03">3 April 1860</date>&#x201C;: Maggs Bros. online catalog, <date when="2008-05-15">15 May 2008</date>).</note> with the <hi rend="italic">diminishing</hi> time left to use it in: pray <hi rend="italic">remember</hi> this always; and never scruple to <hi rend="italic">apply</hi> to me in any pinch,&#x2014;you know that I literally mean what I say it, and that I would not say it if it were not the the truth. It has been in my head for a long time to write to you about Tom my namesake;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick&#x2019;s eldest son, Thomas. TC repeated &#x201C;the&#x201D; in the previous sentence.</note> of whom, on all that I could gather and guess, I have a good opinion; and who seems to be struggling towards some settlement for his own behoof, as is natural at his age, but not successfully hitherto. If you can see any way for him that could be opened by a &#xa3;200 or so, and that promised to be for his real good and yours, I wished you to tell me about it. I am so held to the grindstone, and almost slaved to wreck with this sad Book of mine, I have seldom a moment of my own for any purpose: but I wish you would consider this thing, now that I have got it stated, and if you come to any conclusion, let me know instantly. It is very possible you may not wish Tom himself to know of this at all; if so, be only silent; the secret lies between you and me, and shall <hi rend="italic">so</hi> lie till you permit otherwise. Again I say we are not now scarce of money, nor like to be: my late Books have sold beyond common; the British Public, after having tried in vain to starve me into compliance or death, now renounces the attempt, and says, &#x201C;Live!&#x201C;&#x2014;now when one has so near done with it at any rate! I cannot say I care for any Public, or men or body of men that are so loose from me. That <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a kind of kingship I have attained to by their treatment of me,&#x2014;and by stern <hi rend="italic">Time&#x2019;s</hi> treatment withal, who spares no mortal. Pray understand all this, dear Brother; and <hi rend="italic">act</hi> accordingly when there is reason you should&#x2014;namely <hi rend="italic">good</hi> to be done to you or yours by so doing. And so enough on that subject.</p>
<p>We are all as well as usual; my poor Jane, whom you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hardly know again, so changed and weakly is she, is decidedly better this winter, than for the last two. Jack is here this good while; doing little or nothing; buying old Books, reading, rambling about; very healthy still, and feeling less of age (I fancy) <pb id="pg-36-96" n="36:96"/>than you or I do. From Annandale we hear similar accounts. Jamie at Scotsbrig has his eldest son<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle the younger.</note> now at home (a very reasonable nice young fellow) <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of a situation; who talks of going to Australia &#x26;c,&#x2014;to Jamie&#x2019;s sorrow in his lonely state.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James&#x2019;s wife, Isabella, d. <date when="1859-06-01">1 June 1859</date>.</note> As for me, I <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> diligently and count on a fine continuance of <hi rend="italic">idleness to the end,</hi> if I can live to get this sad Task off my hands, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is by far the hardest I ever had, when there was much more <hi rend="italic">birr</hi> in me. Adieu dear Brother. <closer><salute>God&#x2019;s blessing on you all.&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Your Book is a capital setting forth of that memorable Parliamentary Adventure.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster, <hi rend="italic">The Arrest of the Five Members by Charles the First: A Chapter of English History Rewritten</hi> (<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>); it was reviewed in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> <date when="1860-03-31">31 March</date>.</note> It abounds with information, collected from far and near;&#x2014;and set forth with a lucidity, and perfection of <hi rend="italic">indexing</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is without example, and indeed a great merit. Would to Heaven my Germans had imitated you in that respect, as in several others! The whole thing is solidly hammered out, rivetted like iron; and rolls along like a strong waggon full of goods, but at the trot, and on the crown of the causeway,&#x2014;warning those that meet it in lighter vehicles to hold wide! I think you are too severe upon the poor Charles-First Party;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster apparently told Dickens about TC&#x2019;s letter, as Dickens wrote to Forster, <date when="1860-05-02">2 May</date>: &#x201C;I can understand any man, and particularly Carlyle&#x2019;s, having a lingering respect that does not like to be disturbed, for those &#x2026; loyal gentlemen of the country, who went with the King. &#x2026; But I don&#x2019;t think Carlyle sufficiently considers that the great mass of those gentlemen <hi rend="italic">didn&#x2019;t know the truth</hi>&#x2014;that it was a part of their loyalty to believe what they were told on the King&#x2019;s behalf&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 9:244&#x2013;45).</note> and am sorry for their poor heads, going like eggs under your wheels. That is now the side to take; has it all its own way, after two centuries of suffering: but there is another side too, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will again claim to have the meaning of its views brought home to us, and justly <hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi> on the new terms now possible.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the same letters to Forster, Dickens wrote: &#x201C;It did not occur to me in reading your most excellent, interesting, and remarkable book, that it could with any reason be called one-sided&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 9:244).</note> Take that Strafford Affair up,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Wentworth (<date when="1593-00-00">1593</date>&#x2013;<date when="1641-00-00">1641</date>), 1st earl of Strafford, one of Charles I&#x2019;s most able and most ruthless ministers, lord president of the Council of the North from <date when="1628-00-00">1628</date>, and lord deputy of Ireland from <date when="1632-00-00">1632</date>.

    <salute>Dear Lady Sandwich,</salute>
    <p>Your little Note was a great pleasure to us; perhaps greater than you think;&#x02014;like a little wax-lucifer kindled in a bad night, and cheering one with its clear flame, while it burns, and in memory afterwards. I hope you will send us another, if you <hi rend="italic">don&#x02019;t</hi> keep your prophecy of being home<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Presumably to Lady Sandwich&#x02019;s London home.</note> this week. As for me, I have been in such a toss ever since you last saw me,&#x02014;what with the state of <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi> (the <hi rend="italic">two-footed</hi> Fritz),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">
  <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi>
</note> state of my own liver, state of the weather; what with one thing, what with another,&#x02014;I felt it (and feel it) a duty to keep strictly under a bushel;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Cf. Matt. :15.</note> and say nothing at all, till the ugly cloud got away in some measure. Our weather has been bad to a degree; and today is at the worst,&#x02014;except that this is now the crisis (hail, sleet &#x26;c), and I foresee summer sun behind it. This is a <hi rend="italic">last</hi> tussel of Winter with Summer; such as is <hi rend="italic">due</hi> (according to the Scotch weather-proverb) in the entrance of <date when="0000-04-00">April</date>. <hi rend="italic">Six bad days,</hi> they say, horribly bad; just when <date when="0000-03-00">March</date> is ending and <date when="0000-04-00">April</date> beginning:&#x02014;here they are, a little behind date, and more than six of them; I <pb id="pg-36-98" n="36:98" />

    <p>I went one day, somebody dragging me, to see a new Picture (Christ disputing in the Temple, Father &#x26; Mother finding him there) by Hunt<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss">See above.</note> the Preraphaelite; upon wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he has been working for 3 years (7 in all, for he spent 4 in Palestine as preliminary):<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss">Hunt spent two years, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>&#x02013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>, traveling through the Middle East, including a stay in Jerusalem.</note> a worse job for him than even <hi rend="italic">Fritz,</hi> I think! But the Picture, and the Painter, did seem to me to have extraordinary <pb id="pg-36-100" n="36:100" />merits. The Christ is an exquisite mixture of a god and a peasant lad. His mother too is very fine; but I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> she sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been a little <hi rend="italic">angry</hi> withal (at having got such a fright from her careless son) instead of <hi rend="italic">merely</hi> rapturous over him as she might be over a baby saved from the wolf. There were other criticisms:-but I have not seen such a Picture, for fidelity of execution, for exquisite finish, and limner and other talent, by any modern man.&#x02014; It had turned out worth my while to go?</p>

My hand quite trembles from a consciousness of my temerity in addressing so great a man, but the greatest are also the gentlest, and I can not forget that from your pen has streamed into my room, and my head, hands, mind and heart&#x02014;thoughts and feelings which have strengthened &#x02026; them in many an hour of trial.&#x0201D; The enclosure is unidentified.</note>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Sister Jenny</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>I have twice had a Newspaper from you lately, the last otime only two days ago; and I am always glad to see such a mark of your remembrance,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Newspapers direct from the British Colonies by packet are delivered free of postage at any place within the British dominions&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Post Office Directory</hi> [<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>] 2192); the Carlyles often used the free delivery of newspapers as a way of sending messages to each other; cf. <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580820-TC-JWC-01"><sic>34:151</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1858-08-20">20 Aug. 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note> and understand by it that things are going tolerably well with you, or at least not going far out of course. I would write oftener, and I hope to do so by and by; but at present I am kept at such a press as you have not the least idea of; and, for months and indeed years past, I have had almost to cease corresponding with everybody; and have not, except upon compulsion, written the smallest Note,&#x2014;every moment of my time being so taken up with another dismal kind of &#x201C;writing&#x201D; which I cannot shirk. It is of no use afflicting you with complaints of what you cannot help, or with pity for me which could <pb id="pg-36-105" n="36:105"/>do no good, but the truth is I never had in all my life such a frightfully undoable disgusting piece of work as this which has been reserved for the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of my strength, and it has made and makes me now and for years back <hi rend="italic">miserable</hi> till I see it done. I stick to it like death and it shall not beat me if I can help it. No more of it here,&#x2014;nothing of it, except to explain my silence; within a couple of years, if I live so long, I hope to be much more in case for correspondence with those whom I merely think of with affection, as times are.</p>
<p>To-day I have done a little thing which has been among my purposes for some time, namely, got a small memorial ready for you&#x2014;which so soon as you have read this note you can go and ask for and so conclude. For the paper of the Messrs. Coutts, Bankers,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coutts &#x26; Co., 58 and 59 Strand.</note> I conclude, will go in the same steamer as this Note and all will be ripe by the time you have done reading. You are to go to the &#x201C;Bank of Upper Canada,&#x201D; Hamilton, to say you are &#x201C;Mrs. Janet Hanning&#x201D; and that there is &#xa3;10 for you from &#x201C;Mr. Thomas Carlyle, London&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The money was paid via John A.

Do not trouble yourself writing; address me a newspaper in your own hand and put one stroke on it, that will abundantly tell me whatever is to be said.</p>
<p>Your kindred here and in Scotland are all in their usual course. Nothing wrong with any of them, or nothing to speak of. My own poor Jane has by accident hurt her side a little the other day, which annoys her for the present, but we are promised a &#x201C;perfect cure in less than four weeks.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The end of the letter and the signature are missing.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>It is a special favour of Heaven to me that I hear of you again by this accident;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1860-04-16">16 April</date>, with questions about the American edns. of TC&#x2019;s works.</note> and am made to answer a word <hi rend="italic">de Profundis</hi> [out of the depths]. It is constantly among the fairest of the few hopes that remain for me on the other side of this Stygian Abyss of a Friedrich (sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I ever get thro&#x2019; it alive) that I <hi rend="italic">shall then</hi> begin writing to you again, who knows if not see you in the body before quite taking wing! For I feel always, what I have sometimes written, <pb id="pg-36-106" n="36:106"/>that there is (in a sense) but one completely human voice to me in this world, and that you are it, and have been,&#x2014;thanks to you, whether you speak or not!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote: &#x201C;Continue to be good to your old friends. Tis no matter whether they write to you, or not. If not, they save your time.&#x201D;</note> Let me say also while I am at it, that the few words you sent me about those first Two Volumes are present with me in the far more frightful darknesses of these last Two; and indeed are often almost my one encouragement.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the fourth lecture in his series, &#x201C;Art and Criticism,&#x201D; delivered <date when="1859-04-13">13 April 1859</date> at the Music Hall, Boston, Emerson welcomed the American publication of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great:</hi> &#x201C;Here has come into the country, three months ago &#x2026; infinitely the wittiest book that ever was written; a book that, one would think, the English people would rise up in a mass to thank him for &#x2026; a book holding so many memorable and heroic facts &#x2026; with a range, too, of thought and wisdom, so large, so colloquially elastic, that we not so much read a stereotype page as we see the eyes of the writer looking into ours, whilst he is humming and chuckling, with undertones, and trumpet-tones, and shrugs, and long commanding glances, stereoscoping every figure that passes, and every hill, river, wood, hummock and pebble in the long perspective, with its wonderful mnemonics, whereby great and insignificant men are ineffaceably marked and medalled in the memory by what they were, had and did&#x201D; (&#x201C;Art and Criticism,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Complete Works,</hi> ed. Edward Waldo Emerson, Centenary Edn. [Boston and New York, <date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>] 12:298&#x2013;99). In a notebook entry of <date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>, TC placed a clipping from <hi rend="italic">The Critic,</hi> <date when="1860-03-03">3 March 1860</date>, quoting Emerson&#x2019;s eulogistic praise of <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi> TC attached to it a scrap of paper, on one side of which he wrote &#x201C;sent by a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Langley,&#x201D; and, on the other side: &#x201C;Chelsea, <date when="1860-03-00">March 1860</date>. This already exists quoted in a letter I had from Emerson many months ago. It is very exaggerated criticism, but contains a genuine human <hi rend="italic">recognition</hi> of the Book; and is the only sentence of writing or print, in praise or blame, that I have read on it without more or less of disgust,&#x2014;when the reading at all happened to be forced on me by some cause. This has silently given me a great deal of pleasure, and been a source of pious tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> and encourage<hi rend="italic">ts.</hi>&#x2014; T.C.&#x201D; He later wrote: &#x201C;found, &#x26; reposited here, <date when="1867-03-00">March 1867</date>&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s notebook; private owner).</note> That is a fact, and not exaggerated, tho&#x2019; you think it is. I read some Criticisms of my wretched Book, and hundreds of others I in the gross refused to read; they were in praise, they were in blame; but not one of them looked into the eyes of the object, and in genuine human fashion responded to its human stirrings, and recognised it,&#x2014;completely right, tho&#x2019; with generous exaggerat<hi rend="italic">n!</hi> That was well done, I can tell you: a human voice, far out in the waste deeps, among the inarticulate sea-krakens and obscene monsters, loud-roaring, inexpressibly ugly, dooming you as if to eternal solitude by way of wages,&#x2014;&#x201C;hath exceeding much refreshment in it,&#x201D; as my friend Oliver used to say.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Oliver Cromwell; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:101.</note></p>
<p>Having not one spare moment at present, I will ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to y<hi rend="italic">ou</hi> only the whole contents of that Letter; you in your charity will convey to Mr Wight<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Orlando Williams Wight (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888-00-00">88</date>), American physician and author. His publishers, Brown &#x26; Taggard of Boston, had written to Emerson, enclosing Wight&#x2019;s suggestion that TC be given part of the profits from a forthcoming stereotyped edn., <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays: Collected and Republished, by Thomas Carlyle,</hi> ed.

Wight, if you have a chance of him, is worth knowing: a genuine bit of metal, too thin and ringing for my tastes (hammered, in fact, upon the Yankee anvils), but recognisably of steel and with a keen fire-edge.&#x2014; Pray signify to him that he has done a thing agreeable to me, and that it will be pleasant if I find it will not hurt <hi rend="italic">him.</hi> Profit to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> out of it, except to keep his own soul clear and sound (to his own sense, as it always will be to mine) is perfectly indiff<hi rend="italic">t:&#x2014;</hi>and on the whole I thank him heartily for shewing me a chivalrous human brother, instead of the usual vulturous malodorous and much avoidable phenomenon, in Transatlantic Bibliopoly! This is accurately true;&#x2014;and so far as his Publisher &#x26; he can extract encouragement from this, in the face of vested interests wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I cannot judge of,&#x2014;it is theirs without reserve.</p>
<p>To Mr Cabot be so good as say That Harper of New-York is to me Harp<hi rend="italic">y,</hi> odious, rapacious, not lovely or beneficent at all; that he has not, nor shall ever have if I can help it, the least vestige of a &#x201C;bargain&#x201D; with me in regard to these Two-expected Volumes of <hi rend="italic">Friedrich;&#x2014;</hi>and that in fact I will rather give them frankly away for <hi rend="italic">Zero</hi> to any honest Bookseller whom you or Cabot may recommend, than consign them to Harpydom on the terms their predecessors had.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1860-04-16">16 April</date>: &#x201C;No bookseller here now appears able to fight the Harpers.&#x201D; Harper &#x26; Bros., New York publishing firm, run by four brothers, James (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>), John (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>), Joseph Wesley (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>), and Fletcher (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">77</date>). Harper &#x26; Bros. had pbd. the first two vols. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> and had apparently claimed to Cabot that they expected rights to the remaining vols. (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 529).</note> The wretched mortal wrote to me again and again, while the question with me was not of lucre but of life or death; and in every letter you saw the mingled physiognomy of owl, raven and unclean birds,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The owl and the raven are among the unclean birds listed in Lev. 11:15&#x2013;16.</note>&#x2014;creating a certain horror! To be rid of him I said &#x201C;&#xa3;100 per volume, and no farther talk!&#x201D; He held back, corresponded with Chapman, made me sensible of his evil presence in secondary ways; at length offered while I was in the agonies, &#x201C;&#xa3;50 per volume.&#x201D; I bid Chapman, &#x201C;Close with him, for God&#x2019;s sake, and let <hi rend="italic">him</hi> disappear!&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Chapman, TC&#x2019;s publisher; for earlier correspondence about the U.S. edn., see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571113-TC-EC-01"><sic>33:115</sic><corr>TC to EC, <date when="1857-11-13">13 Nov. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014; That is the exact state of it;&#x2014;and my wish then strongly was, and still is, that I could in some way signify to him, &#x201C;Avaunt, unclean bird, come not between the wind and me again!&#x2014; Be so extremely obliging as to steal any property of mine you can find not guarded by the gallows, and to hold your tongue about it, and not trouble me with any dialogue at all!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am very glad I have got this written down for Mr Cabot; and pray tell him I do not wish that he should take any action farther on the subject,&#x2014;except it were to point me out a man to whom, as above described, I could send the Sheets gratis; if that were the way of shutting Harpy&#x2019;s beak, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> perhaps it <pb id="pg-36-108" n="36:108"/>isn&#x2019;t? In short, that latter is the one result I am ambitious of. And by simply doing nothing, I suppose it will be pretty much secured. The &#xa3;100 from all America is nearly the same as what Tauchnitz<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Bernhard Tauchnitz, Leipzig printer and publisher.</note> yields in the name of all Germany: sums not vital to me &#x2018;at all at all,&#x2019;&#x2014;and worse than zero if there has to be speech of unclean birds about them first!&#x2014;&#x2014; You will need to translate all that into rational deliberate speech; and deliver it mildly, with my gratitude, and other good human feelings (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are not wanting, had I time to state them) to Mr Cabot. Nay the poor devil Harper, he too ought to have justice; and I am not the least angry at him, while he keeps wide of me! Besides I remember, it was not he at all that wrote; but some hungry feathered being (probably in moult at the time) whom he keeps here in London.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sampson Low, Son &#x26; Co., publishers, 47 Ludgate Hill, acted as London agents for Harper &#x26; Bros., <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">86</date>; see also <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580818-JWC-TC-01"><sic>34:144</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1858-08-18">18 Aug. 1858</date></corr></ref>; Sampson Low (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>; <ref target="volume-36/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17075"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) and his son, also Sampson (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">71</date>).</note> God give us patience with all creatures feathered and unfeathered,&#x2014;at least till we can get a chance, to suppress (and extinguish by good methods) the intolerable kinds of them!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Adieu my friend; I have not written so much in the Letter way, not, I think, since you last heard of me.

<salute>Dear Ballantyne,</salute>
<p>I have looked into the N<hi rend="italic">os</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Manch</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Review</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1. <hi rend="italic">Manchester Review of Politics and Literature</hi> began publication <date when="1860-01-07">7 Jan. 1860</date> and ended <date when="1861-12-28">28 Dec. 1861</date>.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you successively sent; and am happy to see that you are under way again. If you will send me a stamped Copy, and the account punctually every quarter, I shall be glad to become a subscriber: but as to writing a &#x201C;Letter&#x201D; of any kind,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">Critic</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps Ballantyne&#x2019;s pseudonym in the paper.</note> is under an enormous mistake if it fancy I have the least minute of leisure time, or the least prospect of any. Very far other is the case if the <hi rend="italic">Critic</hi> knew it! And, to say truth, if I even were at leisure, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> find it a questionable step, and savouring of the impertinent, to write such a Letter as you want,&#x2014;upon <pb id="pg-36-110" n="36:110"/>topics almost totally with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> interest to me; being, as I defined myself the other day, one who &#x201C;does not want any reform-bill; no, and does not care how many there may be!&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Hare (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891-00-00">91</date>; <ref target="volume-36/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12307"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), political reformer, wrote to TC, <date when="1860-04-26">26 April</date>: &#x201C;I perfectly concur with you in thinking that nothing can be expected from those who confine themselves to talking instead of doing&#x201D;; he then asked TC to reply with a note that he could present to the House of Lords committee that was inquiring into constituency reform and into the reasons why so many people did not vote.</note>&#x2014; That is really pretty near the sad fact with me.</p>
<p>Bright,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Bright, involved with many radical causes since the mid-<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>s.

Nobody believes that this dirty little Bill will come to any result except death in the Commons,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord John Russell&#x2019;s Reform Bill to extend suffrage, supported by Bright, had its second reading in early <date when="1860-05-00">May</date> but was widely felt to be too extreme. It was withdrawn <date when="1860-06-11">11 June</date>; the next Reform Act was not passed until <date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am glad of for the present; but my fixed notion is, in this universe of vile palaver where the foolish have got command over the wise, and are more and more in condition to reduce <hi rend="italic">them</hi> to silence,&#x2014;some form of universal Suffrage is inevitable for us; and I have said to it, &#x201C;very well, then! Come along at your own rate,&#x2014;perhaps the faster the better!&#x201D;</p>
<p>This is not to discourage you or other persons of insight to keep saying their say, and getting what audience they can; but it represents my profound indifference to the matter, and that I am disgusted with it to the heart; and have not the least hope left in the Parliamentary Affair at all, in the pass it has now come to.</p>
<p>Adieu: go on and prosper<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Kings 22:12.</note> nevertheless.</p>

<p><salute>You <hi rend="italic">very</hi> nice woman!</salute> In no ordinary circumstances could your <hi rend="italic">first</hi> letter to me have remained so many days unanswered. But my circumstances have been &#x201C;anything but&#x201D; (as my Cockney maid<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Southam.</note> says)&#x2014;in fact quite exceptional&#x2014;for am I not, at this writing, and have I not been for ten days back, plastered and bandaged up after the manner of an Egytian Mummy? and forbidden, under penalties to use my right hand? But human patience has limits&#x2014;and today I take the liberty of clearing them at a flying leap! I have just written to Miss Jess<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jess Donaldson.</note>&#x2014;and now I write to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> before putting my arm into its sling again.</p>
<p>My excuse for making this great crash among my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Barnes.</note> commandments is just, that I have something to say. and I will be brief with it.</p>
<p>Since I had your letter, I have received one from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Campbell,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jess Donaldson&#x2019;s nurse; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600407-JWC-EDO-01">JWC to <sic>ED</sic><corr>EDO</corr>, [<date when="1860-04-07">7 April</date>]</ref>.</note> also written at Miss Jesss desire. In this last I am told that Eliza Donaldson leaves this day week; and in the same sentence the writer goes on to say that Miss Jess is very &#x201C;sorry about my accident which disappoints her glad expectance.&#x201D; Now look here! Dear!&#x2014;I want to understand clearly&#x2014;if possible&#x2014;(and it is only possible thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">your</hi> intervention) what Miss Jess&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">real</hi> wish and feeling is about seeing me; and if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> think it would be worth while for me to go to her for two or three weeks&#x2014;I mean worth while in the sense of being of any use or comfort to her&#x2014;enough to counterbalance the bother of me.</p>
<p>Even I, who know Miss Jess so well, cannot always gather her real meaning out of her <hi rend="italic">words,</hi> unless I have her <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> to help them out; she is so beset with delicacies and apprehensions in her intercourse with even her most intimate friends. She is quite <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> saying she desires a thing that would be disagreeable or at best indifferent to her; in mere apprehension of seeming &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">unkind,</hi>&#x201D; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">ungrateful,</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;of &#x201C;hurting some one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">feelings</hi>&#x201D; by <hi rend="italic">not</hi> expressing desire for it. Or again, she is <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> expressing no desire for what would in reality be very agreeable to her; out of excessive delicacy about putting anybody to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">trouble</hi>&#x201D; for her. Such being her manner of being from of old I am quite at a loss, how to interpret, practically, her present talk about my coming.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-36-112" n="36:112"/>When I heard that Miss Donaldson<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Donaldson.</note> was at the point of death, and before I knew whether any of &#x201C;the nieces&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were six Donaldson nieces.</note> <hi rend="italic">would</hi> go to poor Miss Jess,&#x2014;at the sacrifice of all these marriage gaities!,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Kay Donaldson m. Edward Griffith, <date when="1860-04-11">11 April</date>.</note>&#x2014;I wrote offering to go at a days notice; and begged of Jane Howden<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the das. of Dr. Thomas Howden, partner of JWC&#x2019;s father.</note> whom Miss Jess had employed to inform me about her sister, that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> would find out if Miss Jess would like me there. Jane Howden&#x2019;s answer was, that &#x201C;Certainly I <hi rend="italic">ought not</hi> to come&#x201D;; and that &#x201C;Miss Jess <hi rend="italic">wanted nothing but to be let alone.</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; Short and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sweet&#x2014;but conclusive as to the purpose. When I heard from Craven Hill<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >London home of Stuart Donaldson&#x2019;s widow, Betty, and family.</note> that Eliza had gone at once, and was not to leave again immediately; I felt as well as Jane Howden could tell me, that there was no need of me there. In a family bereavement, one of the family is always the most natural &#x26; acceptable companion&#x2014;however it may be at other times.</p>
<p>Now having made this offer, and Miss Jess being <hi rend="italic">so made;</hi> it is quite possible she might express herself eager for my coming&#x2014;without <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> at all eager&#x2014;just to show what she would call &#x201C;a due sense of my kindness&#x201C;&#x2014; On the other hand she <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be really wishing for me, and not like to say how much,&#x2014;for fear of putting me to inconvenience.</p>
<p>In trying to ascertain for me her actual, exact wish in the matter; you will be helping me to decide whether to come or not&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the case as regards myself is this. <hi rend="italic">Independently of Miss Jess,</hi> I have no wish or intention of going to Scotland this year. I saw all my people there so lately; my Husband is not likely to leave home this year; the journey is a very fatiguing one; and expensive, as I am not strong enough for <hi rend="italic">cheap</hi> travelling. All this considered, there would be no sense in my streaming off by myself to Scotland; unless for some special good reason. If I could feel sure that my presence would be any comfort or pleasure to that dear suffering Soul, even for the time being, I would deem <hi rend="italic">that</hi> special good reason enough&#x2014;and decide to go&#x2014;with what heart I have! Not only because I would do harder things than that to please her; but because, should I outlive her, it would be a cruel thought for me hereafter, that I had it in my power to please her and let the opportunity slip. I dont think I need say any more to make my meaning plain.</p>
<p>If you recommend my coming tell me <hi rend="italic">when</hi> would be most agreeable to her. My broken rib will be all right three weeks hence my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> thinks. Love to your Husband<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Dods.</note> a kiss to yourself <closer><salute>affectionately yours</salute></closer></p>
<name>Jane Carlyle</name>
<ps><p><pb id="pg-36-113" n="36:113"/>Please go up to Miss Jess at once&#x2014;for she will be wanting my letter answered, and that would be a good opportunity for seeing into her mind</p></ps>

<dateline>5 Cheyne Row <place>chelsea</place> Thursday [<date when="1860-05-17">17 May 1860</date>]</dateline>
<p><salute>Oh my Dear!</salute> I don&#x2019;t think a more sensible thought has come into my head these seven years, than just that of writing to you as I did, the other day! <pb id="pg-36-116" n="36:116"/>How completely the letter received from Jess herself, some three hours after receipt of yours, would have misled me! What a foolish game at cross-purposes we (she and I) should have played, if I had not had your Answer, helping me to a right interpretation of her words!</p>
<p>Poor Miss Jess! I should be very angry with her sometimes for her want of <hi rend="italic">directness;</hi> if it weren&#x2019;t that when one has known and cared for a person as long as I have known and cared for <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> one gets to accept that person <hi rend="italic">all of a piece,&#x2014;</hi>not mapped out for one into such and such qualities and dispositions, like a phrenological plaster head! And so I make no more objection to any feature of Miss Jess&#x2019;s mind than I make to the nose on her face! It is <hi rend="italic">a part of her&#x2014;</hi>I see it there plain enough&#x2014;I love her <hi rend="italic">as a whole&#x2014;</hi>and what signifies going into <hi rend="italic">details?</hi> You understand?&#x2014; Besides her state is so sad and forlorn now, that one may well grant her any little individuality that gives her the least comfort!</p>
<p>But what a stupid mistake she would have led me into if I had trusted to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> words alone!&#x2014; I should certainly have gone to Sunny Bank&#x2014;so soon as my broken rib had mended, and I had escaped from my condition of Mummy! And it would have been <hi rend="italic">very</hi> inconvenient for me to go, and <hi rend="italic">very</hi> painful for me to be there! <hi rend="italic">how</hi> inconvenient and <hi rend="italic">how</hi> painful I would not let myself think; so long as the fulfilment of an old promise, and present sympathy and kindness <hi rend="italic">might</hi> demand it.</p>
<p>Here is what she says about my coming&#x2014;in spite of my most earnest entreaties to her that she would be &#x201C;frank.&#x201C;&#x2014;letting no nonsensical delicacies modify the expression of her <hi rend="italic">real</hi> mind!&#x2014; She says&#x2014;&#x201C;you are the only friend that thoroughly understands what my feelings are, and whose words sooth and comfort me, and would have come to me, <hi rend="italic">the poor lonely one,</hi> and would still do so! Oh what happiness to me, were such a thing right! But I feel that I would be <hi rend="italic">selfish</hi> to write what my heart would dictate; For surely there is no one I so desire to see!&#x201C;&#x2014; Then again she says, &#x201C;I will much long to hear again! I know you could not venture just at present. You must suffer from your sad accident for some time. And I would grieve were you to run any risk. I can only say, that if you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> venture at all any time, any day would be hailed by me!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now, my Dear, would not any one interpreting the above, by the light of unassisted nature, read out of it, that the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> drawback in Miss Jess&#x2019;s wish for me was the fear of putting <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to risk or inconvenience?&#x2014;a consideration which (if she had thought of it) was sure to excite a contest of <hi rend="italic">generosity,</hi> in which I should have insisted on having the best&#x2014;and both of us would have gained a loss!</p>
<p>Interpreted by my knowledge of the dear woman&#x2019;s ways, and by the clear indications, contained in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> letter, the meaning however reads differently. <pb id="pg-36-117" n="36:117"/>And I have already written to her that I have quite given up the idea of seeing her this year I did not say a word of your last letter&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">but</hi> as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> cannot &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">pretend</hi>&#x2019; (as we used to say at school) I told her my reason for changing my mind was, that I <hi rend="italic">could see</hi> she would rather be let alone. I told her this in the kindest words I could find. still I dare say she would rather I hadnt <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> so far&#x2014;tho&#x2019; she will be relieved from the idea of my visit. It is a great relief to myself also&#x2014;for several reasons, which I feel the whole force of now; tho&#x2019; I would not let them <hi rend="italic">speak out in me above their breath,</hi> so long as <hi rend="italic">going</hi> seemed to me (in Miss Jess&#x2019;s words) &#x201C;the right thing to do.&#x201D;</p>
<p>If you would kindly tell me now and then, how she is in health and spirits, I should feel it very kind. &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Campbell can write at anytime&#x201D; Miss Jess says&#x2014;but&#x2014;I would rather here from <hi rend="italic">you.</hi></p>
<p>I do hope I shall be in London when you come in <date when="1860-08-00">August</date>. Be sure to send your address so soon as you arrive, that we may make some appointment. Chelsea is rather too far from the center of things, for coming there on chance, tho&#x2019; it is very accessible. I shall be heartily glad to see you both again</p>

<salute>My dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I am often, very often thinking of you here, tho&#x2019; I say nothing; and indeed I have seldom the least minute of time to spend on anything but my dreary most <hi rend="italic">dreigh</hi> and intolerable Task which has consumed painfully so many of my latter days and years. Except upon compulsion I can seldom or never be got to write a Note to anybody, even those most valuable to me. If I live ever to get done&#x2014;! And that I do hope in general; tho&#x2019;, at times, I am in considerable gloom about it.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You are very kind to think of me again, and remember me after so long a silence.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >If this letter is to Sinclair, then the letters of <date when="1859-10-02">2</date> and <date when="1859-10-08">8 Oct. 1859</date> (see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18591003-TC-SGSOUC-01"><sic>35:224</sic><corr>TC to SGSOUC, <date when="1859-10-18">18 Oct. 1859</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-35/lt-18591008-TC-SGSOUC-01"><sic>230</sic><corr>TC to SGSOUC, <date when="1859-10-08">8 Oct. 1859</date></corr></ref>) were almost certainly not to him but to an unidentified correspondent, as eight months would hardly constitute &#x201C;so long a silence.&#x201D; For TC&#x2019;s last known letter (in <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>) to Sinclair, see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550724-TC-SGS-01"><sic>30:8&#x2013;10</sic><corr>TC to SGS, <date when="1855-07-24">24 July 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> I agree heartily in your indignations and abhorrences about that conspicuous Devil&#x2019;s-Servant who for the present is called &#x201C;Emperor of the French,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sinclair was known to regard &#x201C;with an intensity of dislike I have never known to be surpassed, the conduct of Louis Napoleon ever since the <hi rend="italic">coup d&#x2019;&#xE9;tat</hi> of <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>. [Sinclair] looked upon that deed &#x2026; as the most enormous crime which has been committed in our day&#x201D; (Grant, <hi rend="italic">Sir George Sinclair</hi> 326).</note>&#x2014;and finds hitherto no Servant of <hi rend="small-caps">The Other Party</hi>, sufficiently fixed in mind and circumstances, to take him by the beard, and fling him, and his sulphurous rubbish after him, <hi rend="italic">home</hi> to the Place <hi rend="italic">they will</hi> full surely reach by one route or another!&#x2014;&#x2014; But on such points I keep myself studiously <pb id="pg-36-120" n="36:120"/>remote, studying not to think of them at all; tho&#x2019; well pleased to see honest men doing it, as they have opportunity.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sinclair repeatedly attacked Napoleon III in the <hi rend="italic">Northern Ensign</hi>. Lord Derby, having read his letters there, wrote to him, <date when="1860-03-17">17 March</date>, about the treachery of Napoleon and Victor Emmanuel (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>), king of Sardinia and Italy, in the annexation of Savoy: &#x201C;Events are very critical at this moment, even more so than when you wrote: for the last forty-eight hours have completely stripped off the mask from both Emperor and King, and have shown themselves and their motives in the clearest, if not the cleanest point of view. What Europe will do remains to be seen; but I fear the various Powers are too much at variance with each other to hope that they will take the one safe course, and unite against the general disturbers of the peace of Europe&#x201D; (Grant, <hi rend="italic">Sir George Sinclair</hi> 333). Napoleon III had annexed Savoy ca. <date when="1860-03-12">12 March</date>; the treaty of annexation was signed <date when="1860-03-24">24 March</date>.</note></p>
<p>I am at a very low pitch at present; having had, and being still like to have for unlimited months, a most undoable problem in this poor Book of mine, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have got chained to, for my sins. Never in my life did there turn up for me so intolerable a burden as this, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I look upon as the finale. Certainly either it must finish, or else I! The outlooks are sometimes very bad; then again not quite so bad. If I had any health left, I seem as if I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> still do it: but that is the ticklish point,&#x2014;especially at the years I have reached. Silence, and the frugal employment of every available hour and resource, is clearly my only method. Not once in the month do I write even such a Note as this. If I live to get thro&#x2019;, you shall hear more of me.</p>
<p>My Wife has been a good deal better last winter than for the preceding two, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is surely to be counted a great alleviation in the bad times. She sends you many regards and wishes;&#x2014;as do I; and am always,</p>

<p>You are abundantly obliging:&#x2014;and if you go on Saturday Afternoon, and dare undertake a Valetudinarian Companion (decidedly below par at this time, and longing for Country quietude, and <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> more than anything), I shall be glad to attend you, and make some acquaintance with Checquers<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chequers, Tudor mansion nr.

<p>If Saturday be your day, perhaps I could catch you in Lower Belgrave Street<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir William&#x2019;s London home was at 7 Lower Belgrave St.</note> most conveniently of all?

For the battle of Fontenoy, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:93&#x2013;103.</note> Captain of the Scots Fusiliers, main actor in the business; it was sent me last year by Lord Gifford;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Hay (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">62</date>), earl of Gifford, eldest son of George Hay (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>), 8th marquis of Tweeddale.</note> and I could have made a little story out of it which would have been worth publishing.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine.</hi></note></p>
<p>But on applying to Lord Gifford, he (what he is himself, I believe, truly sorry for) cannot at present give me permission.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Hay&#x2019;s letter, written to his eldest brother, John (d. <date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>), 4th marquis, was in the family papers at Yester House, East Lothian; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:99.

<p>If I ever in the end of this book have life left, you shall have plenty of things. But for the time being I can only answer <hi rend="italic">de profundis</hi> [from the depths] to the above effect.</p>
<p>Fair wind and full sea to you in this hitherto so successful voyage, for which the omens certainly are on all sides good. Your people do not send me a copy (since No. I.);<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first issue of the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi> was pbd. <date when="1860-01-00">Jan. 1860</date>; TC had been sent an advance copy; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18591229-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1859-12-29">29 Dec. 1859</date></ref>.</note> but we always draw our purse upon it to the small extent requisite.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever truly,</salute></closer></p>

I am not apt to forget where my affections are concerned,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I never in my life could recollect <hi rend="italic">some</hi> things&#x2014;for example <hi rend="italic">the multiplication table&#x2014;historical dates,&#x2014;</hi>or people I meet in society who havn&#x2019;t interested me! But whoever or whatever might slip thro my head; it would never be <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> Dear, or any known wish of <hi rend="italic">yours&#x2014;</hi>never, never as long as I live! And so, I would have <hi rend="small-caps">made</hi> <hi rend="italic">time</hi> for writing on <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi> if I had not been unavoidably hindered till <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi> the week before, so that the <pb id="pg-36-127" n="36:127"/><hi rend="italic">week</hi> was not absolutely out till <hi rend="italic">Thursday&#x2014;</hi> Tho&#x2019; I see now <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was a stupid way of computing.</p>
<p>Oh my dear dear Friend! how unhappy it makes me to hear of your having caught fresh cold, and having bad nights, and being altogether so suffering!&#x2014;And you must <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> all your bodily ailments more severely <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> feel them in all their <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> painfulness <hi rend="italic">now</hi> that the nervous <hi rend="italic">strain</hi> is removed&#x2014;the continual anxious thought and care of my beloved Godmother,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Donaldson, who d. <date when="1860-03-30">30 March</date>.</note> which was so long a sort of <hi rend="italic">artificial strength</hi> for you, has found sad <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> for evermore! Your <hi rend="italic">own</hi> weakness of body, and shattered nerves was a terrible enough burden to bear; and in addition to that, there is <hi rend="italic">now</hi> to be born the <hi rend="italic">reaction</hi> of all your long anxieties and over exertions! <hi rend="italic">Can</hi> I wonder that you are so suffering my poor Dear?&#x2014; Alas! that there can be no wonder, does not make the fact less sorrowful to me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Actually I am terrified now to hear the Postman&#x2019;s rap, and to open a letter! so much bad news has been the result of late! I don&#x2019;t recollect if I told you that my <hi rend="italic">other</hi> cousin John Welsh (my Uncle in Liverpool&#x2019;s youngest and favorite son)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh, son of JWC&#x2019;s maternal uncle, John Welsh.</note> died in America of a stroke of apoplexy a few weeks ago. He was the <hi rend="italic">pet</hi> of the whole family, and his Brothers and Sisters<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had two brothers, Alexander and Walter, and three surviving sisters, Jeannie, Margaret, and Mary.</note> are in sore distress&#x2014;not only at having lost him but that none of them should have been beside him at his death&#x2014;and that his being so far away from them all had led to it; the climate and society of Mobile<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mobile, Alabama, one of the wealthiest and busiest ports in the United States at the time because of the cotton boom.</note> having a bad repute for betraying young men to a reckless course of Life.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had an intimation of the death of Robert MacTurk<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He d. <date when="1860-05-30">30 May</date> of apoplexy.</note> (a very old Dumfrieshire friend, endeared to me by many associations, as well as by a lifelong affection for myself).</p>
<p>He too must have been cut off quite suddenly. For in two letters from different people, received within the last fortnight, he was mentioned to me as being &#x201C;in the most flourishing condition, both as to health and fortune, of any man in Dumfrieshire.&#x201C;&#x2014; The Three black bordered lines, coming so soon after, to tell me he was <hi rend="italic">dead,</hi> made me all but drop from my chair.&#x2014; He has left a sweet little invalid Wife, who has been nursed and cherished like an <hi rend="italic">infant</hi> by him for twenty years!

<p><salute>Oh my Dear, my Dear!&#x2014;</salute> I could not have believed that Miss Jess&#x2019;s death<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jess Donaldson d. Fri., <date when="1860-06-01">1 June</date>.</note> would shock me as it has done! Since she was left <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> there, so desolate, so suffering, I have not felt to expect or wish her life prolonged;&#x2014;have <hi rend="italic">said</hi> again and again, that it was to be hoped that she would not long survive her sister.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean d. <date when="1860-03-30">30 March</date>.</note> But to <hi rend="italic">say,</hi> even to think <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was one thing; to feel it come true is another!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Then,</hi> I thought only of <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> with her ailments and her sorrows, from which no deliverance was possible, while life endured; <hi rend="italic">now</hi> I think of myself&#x2014;who have lost, in these two dear old Sisters, not only the most loving, most faithful Friends that woman ever had; but the last living link between me and my happy childhood.</p>
<p>When I think of Sunny Bank all silent and empty&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">me&#x2014;</hi>for evermore!&#x2014; I can&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">cry&#x2014;</hi>I dont <hi rend="italic">grieve&#x2014;</hi>it was so miserable to think of them alive <hi rend="italic">as I saw them last!</hi> but&#x2014;that strange, new silence and emptiness strikes to my heart like positive physical pain.</p>
<p>And it was so dreadful the way in which the news came to me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On Saturday morning I received a letter from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Campbell.</p>
<p>Miss Jess had told her &#x201C;last night&#x201D; she said (that was on the Thursday night) to write to me, and &#x201C;tell me how she was,&#x201D; and that she was, &#x201C;wearying to hear from me&#x201C;&#x2014; It was only <hi rend="italic">six days</hi> since I had written her a long letter!, another letter from me would reach her on Friday morning a few hours after M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Campbells letter was written&#x2014; The date of that being &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">11 minutes after 4&#x2014;morning&#x2014;Friday&#x2014;in haste</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; The account of Miss Jess, tho&#x2019; mentioning &#x201C;increased weakness&#x201D; and a&#x201C;fresh cold caught,&#x201D; had nothing immediately alarming in it&#x2014;except for that strange minuteness of the date, which one might make much or little of according to the quality of one&#x2019;s Imagination. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was inclined to take alarm at it. But M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, when I pointed it out to him, said <hi rend="italic">he</hi> &#x201C;saw nothing in it but a wish to be minute&#x201C;&#x2014;so I wrote <hi rend="italic">another</hi> letter to Miss Jess,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600602-JWC-JDO-01">JWC to <sic>JD</sic><corr>JDO</corr>, [<date when="1860-06-02">2 June</date>]</ref>.</note> and then one to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Campbell asking about the perplexing line of <pb id="pg-36-130" n="36:130"/>her note, and whether Miss Jess would like me to write her a short letter every day, instead of the accustomed long one, once a week. I got M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to take my letters to the post office in a Thunder shower; so anxious I was to not miss a post! Then I flung myself on the sofa to compose my mind; and I had not lain there many minutes when a note was brought me&#x2014;it was from George Donaldson,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Hay Donaldson, Jess&#x2019;s nephew.</note> forwarding the telegraph message! My God! the kind heart which had just been &#x201C;wearying to hear from me,&#x201D; and which I had just been trying to comfort with the most loving, sympathizing words, had already ceased to beat&#x2014;my written words would travel on at Railway speed, to a house of Death!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> I should get a letter from <hi rend="italic">you</hi> this morning waited for it as confidently as if it had been <hi rend="italic">promised;</hi> For I have faith in your kindness and thoughtfulness have had, ever since that first night I spoke to you in the Drawingroom at Sunny Bank!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They met <date when="1857-09-00">Sept. 1857</date>; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570919-JWC-WDO-01"><sic>33:89</sic><corr>JWC to WDO, <date when="1857-09-19">19 Sept. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Your<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> remember?</p>
<p>And I have faith in your Husband,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Dods.</note> of much longer standing!&#x2014; I don&#x2019;t believe he has the least idea how well I have kept him in mind all thro&#x2019; my womans life!</p>

<salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your kind gift of the Cromwell Photographs:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were several portraits of Cromwell at Chequers, the most famous being that of Cromwell in armor, with a page tying his sash, painted by Robert Walker (ca. <date when="1600-00-00">1600</date>&#x2013;<date when="1658-00-00">1658</date>). According to Augustus Hare, who visited Chequers <date when="1860-04-00">April 1860</date>: &#x201C;in its grand old gallery hung portraits of the Protector, his mother, brother, his four daughters, two sons-in-law, secretary, &#x26;c. Here, also, enclosed in a cabinet, was a very awful mask taken from Cromwell&#x2019;s face after death, which Lady Frankland used to uncover with great solemnity&#x201D; (Augustus J. C. Hare, <hi rend="italic">The Story of My Life</hi> [<date when="1896-00-00">1896</date>&#x2013;<date when="1900-00-00">1900</date>] 2:240).</note> I have put them up in my Dressing room, that I may have them daily in my eye henceforth;&#x2014;it seems these things have a tendency to <hi rend="italic">fade</hi> in course of time, as we ourselves and all other things have! The little Oliver<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the portrait of a two-year-old child said to be Oliver Cromwell, although of doubtful authenticity; see John Gilbert Jenkins, <hi rend="italic">Chequers</hi> (Oxford, <date when="1967-00-00">1967</date>) 124.</note> is charming; so <hi rend="italic">like</hi> the &#x201C;mask&#x201D; he ultimately left, too (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Chequers one),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;death mask&#x201D; at Chequers is probably a cast from a bust of Cromwell by the sculptor Edward Pierce (ca. <date when="1635-00-00">1635</date>&#x2013;<date when="1695-00-00">95</date>). The bust is possibly based on the head of the funeral effigy modeled in wax by the official engraver, Thomas Simon (<date when="1623-00-00">1623?</date>&#x2013;<date when="1665-00-00">65</date>) (Jenkins 123).

<p>I retain a lively remembrance of Chequers, as is very natural; and of the good hospitable inmates there, who would have made a far less interesting place agreeable and memorable. May prosperity remain within its walls;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 122:6&#x2013;7.</note> that is the least I can say and feel.</p>

<p>I am really terrified just now to hear the Postman&#x2019;s rap and to open a letter! one death after another, in which I have an interest more or less deep, has followed, till it is born in on me that every letter I receive, especially in an unknown handwriting, must be either &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">an intimation,</hi>&#x201D; or news of deadly illness!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Two,</hi> within the last week, of my oldest friends! gone! the one so unexpectedly; for I had heard quite recently of Robert McTurk<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle noted that Robert McTurk was an &#x201C;early lover of Miss Welsh, when she was &#x2018;an extremely absurd little girl&#x2019;&#x201D; (A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:225), quoting what JWC had said of herself in relation to McTurk; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581230-JWC-MR-01"><sic>34:257</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1858-12-30">30 Dec. 1858</date></corr></ref>. For an early reference to meeting McTurk, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201014-JBW-EA-01"><sic>1:280</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1820-10-14">14 Oct. 1820</date></corr></ref>, and for his inclusion in JWC&#x2019;s list of unacceptable suitors (which also included George Rennie), see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220100-JBW-EA-01"><sic>2:17</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1822-01-00">Jan. 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note> both from you, and from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle (Pott)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet, previously Mrs. Pringle, now Mrs. Pott.</note>&#x2014;and both reported him so well! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> P said, I remember, that he was &#x201C;the one flourishing man in that quarter&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Too</hi> flourishing!&#x2014; I take it for granted that he died of apoplexy!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600602-JWC-JDO-01">JWC to <sic>JD</sic><corr>JDO</corr>, [<date when="1860-06-02">2 June</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014; My dear old Miss Jess Donaldson&#x2019;s death was not unexpected for me; Since the elder Sister went, hardly two months ago, I felt sure the other would soon follow; the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> interest and occupation and companionship in life that had kept her from sinking under a complication of ailments (the worst of them <hi rend="italic">old age</hi>) being withdrawn; what indeed remained for that poor old solitary life-long invalid but to die?!&#x2014; Those who loved her best could not wish her life <pb id="pg-36-133" n="36:133"/>prolonged in such suffering and desolation! But it was so <hi rend="italic">sudden</hi> a death at the last! almost without any increase of illness&#x2014;a slight cold, that would not have killed a baby, killed <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> worn to a shred as she was! And there were circumstances which made the suddenness a great shock to me, tho&#x2019; both expecting and wishing she might not live long!</p>
<p>On Saturday I received a letter from her Nurse to the effect that Miss Jess had desired her the night before to write to me, to tell me how she was, and that she was &#x201C;wearying to hear&#x201D; from me&#x2014;(she had had a long letter from me just <hi rend="italic">six days</hi> before! and <hi rend="italic">another</hi> would reach her an hour or two after the nurse&#x2019;s was posted! I had written to her <hi rend="italic">once a week</hi> for years back&#x2014;) The Nurses account told of &#x201C;increased weakness&#x201D; and &#x201C;a slight cold&#x201D; but did not suggest <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> danger. Only the date &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">4 in the morning in haste</hi>&#x201D; perplexed my imagination&#x2014; I was just going to write to <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> to ask about M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> MacTurk; but I wrote instead to the nurse, to ask how she came to be writing to me at that hour of the morning? &#x201C;Was Miss Jess so ill that she had to <hi rend="italic">sit up</hi> with her?&#x201D; &#x201C;What was the &#x201C;haste&#x201D; about?&#x201D; And &#x201C;would Miss Jess like me to write her a short note every day instead of the accustomed long one, once a week?&#x201D;</p>
<p>This done, I wrote <hi rend="italic">another</hi> long letter to Miss Jess herself. The dear old soul shouldnt be let &#x201C;weary to hear from me&#x201D; again!</p>
<p>The rain falling in torrents, I had a difficulty in getting my letters to the post office&#x2014;at last they were posted and I laid myself on the sofa to rest, and think it all over&#x2014; Before many minutes the Postman rapped and a note was brought me&#x2014; I didnt know the handwriting and opened it with impatience, not to say indifference&#x2014;for I guessed it was some bothering <hi rend="italic">invitation</hi> that would require me to get up and write a polite refusal&#x2014;</p>
<p>An invitation?&#x2014; Good God! it was a note from George Donaldson (their eldest nephew, in London) telling me he had just received a telegraph message from the Haddington <hi rend="italic">Banker</hi>(!)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William Dods, bank agent and a friend of the Donaldsons.</note> to say Miss Jess was dead!</p>
<p>On Monday morning came a whole handful of black-bordered letters to me&#x2014;all on the same subject&#x2014;one from the nurse explained that, Miss Jess had told her on the Thursday night to write a letter to me in time for the eight oclock morning post&#x2014; She <hi rend="italic">was</hi> sitting up with her; but would not write while a candle was needed for fear of the light disturbing her. at four in the morning of Friday she said to the Nurse&#x2014;&#x201C;it is daylight now; couldnt you see to write to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x201D; When the letter was written she (Miss Jess) got out of bed to read it!&#x2014;but couldnt and bade the Nurse read it to her&#x2014; &#x201C;That will do&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;I am sure M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle will be sorry to hear I am so poorly and <hi rend="italic">she hasn&#x2019;t seen me</hi>&#x201D;! The Nurse said &#x201C;will I tell her to come; I had better&#x2014;&#x201D; &#x201C;No! said the other not yet!&#x2014;we will wait till we see her letter.&#x201D; Nobody thought her so near <pb id="pg-36-134" n="36:134"/>her end&#x2014;she died at eight the same evening! The letter from me which reached her in the forenoon of her last day. She opened, but laid aside unread&#x2014;saying &#x201C;I cant be troubled to read it just now&#x2014;I will read it after!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Which the Nurse thought very strange &#x201C;after having so wearied for it&#x201C;&#x2014;not seeing their was a worse weariness on her&#x2014;the weariness of <hi rend="italic">death!</hi></p>
<p>Will you write and tell me any thing you know about Robert MacTurks death. and how that poor little sweet invalid woman<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet McTurk.</note> is bearing it?&#x2014; Surely it will be <hi rend="italic">her</hi> death too! for he seemed to carry her thro life in his arms! I would like to write to her&#x2014;just to say how sorry I am! But I am afraid of her being too ill to find a line from me anything but intrusive, There are some griefs too cruel for being touched even with a word of sympathy, and it seems to me this of hers must be such! Love to your Husband&#x2014;</p>

<ps><p>My Husband is working himself to death&#x2014;has no thought of going north this year!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Except a week or two at the Grange (<date when="1860-01-00">January 1860</date>), which did not hurt either of us, I think we had intended to make no visits this year, or as good as none. We did, however, and for good reasons, make two&#x2014;hers, a most unlucky or provoking one, provokingly curtailed and frustrated, as will be seen. This was in <date when="1860-08-00">August</date>, to Alderley, and she could have gone further but for blind ill luck. Beginning of <date when="1860-07-00">July</date> she had tried a week or thereby of lodging at Brighton, and invited me, who tried for three days but could get no sleep for noises, and had to hurry home by myself; where also I could not sleep nor stay to any purpose, and was chiefly by brother John, who accompanied, led by sea to Thurso, for a &#x2018;long sail&#x2019; first of all&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s headnote in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:18&#x2013;19). TC went to stay with Sir George Sinclair at Thurso Castle <date when="1860-08-04">4 Aug.</date> to <date when="1860-09-07">7 Sept.</date></note>&#x2014;and I shall not dare to leave him in his present way. I cannot make him take care of himself&#x2014;but I can put all sorts of hindrance in the way of his absolutely killing himself.</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Mr Neuberg</salute>
<p>Mr C has as good as engaged to go to Southend<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seaside resort town in Essex, 40 mi. E of London.</note> tomorrow; provided you came along with us; and I was on the point of writing to that effect. Now he has &#x201C;reconsidered the matter&#x201C;&#x2014;(A most distressing turn for <hi rend="italic">reconsidering</hi> that man has!)&#x2014;and the result is an obstinate determination not to stir&#x2014;&#x201C;with the light he at present has.&#x201C;&#x2014; Clearly the only chance to get him out of this bad train of awaking at unseasonable hours<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Early in the summer of [<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>], I was visited by sleeplessness; and first began to have an apprehension that I should never get my sad book on Friedrich finished, that it would finish me instead. I still remember well enough the dark, cold, vague, yet authentic-looking feeling of terror that shot athwart me as I sat smoking &#x2018;up the chimney,&#x2019; huddled in rugs, dressing-gown and cape, with candle on the hob, my one remedy in sleepless cases; the first real assault of fear, pointing, as it were, to undeniable fact; and how it saddened me the whole of next day. The second day, I compared it to Luther&#x2019;s temptings by the devil; and thought to myself in Luther&#x2019;s dialect, &#x2018;Well, well, Herr Teufel, we will just go on as long as we are alive; and keep working, all the same, till thou do get us killed!&#x2019; This put away the terror, but would by no means bring the sleep back. I recollect lying whole nights awake, still as a stone; getting up at six, and riding to Clapham Common, to Hammersmith region, by way of surrogate for sleep&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s headnote in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:25&#x2013;26).</note> is that I should go myself to Southend, in the first instance, and qualify myself for reporting about &#x201C;quiet beds&#x201D; &#x26;c from my own <hi rend="italic">experience.</hi></p>
<p>So are you prepared to go with only <hi rend="italic">me</hi> tomorrow, by the 2.22 train?&#x2014;to stay till Monday&#x2014;if possible? If not, could you send me by the first post tomorrow precise directions about your &#x201C;quiet Inn&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>

<p>Of course she will be quite <hi rend="italic">red</hi> still! But I am as sure as you are, that she will grow up very beautiful and very good; and be the light of her Father&#x2019;s eyes and the joy of his heart.

      I got well enough on to Brighton yesterday; indeed had nothing to complain of, except that at <hi rend="italic">Wandsworth</hi>

Happily it ended in 2 hours; and I got to our lodgings, a very nice cool place, and was soon after joined by Jane, who seemed no worse for her change to the sea side. I expected to do very well all yesterday; and still hope I shall, tho&#x02019; not so emphatically,&#x02014;the diligence of <hi rend="italic">cocks</hi> &#x26;c having (in spite of all assurances) been busy upon me, so that my sleep was broken, tho&#x02019; in <hi rend="italic">sum</hi> I had a good deal of it, and feel a little better. I must try to do my best tonight and endure the annoyance with the minimum of flurry. The Town is quite beautiful, so cool, clean, airy, wholesome; I have been twice in the sea, &#x26; find it profitable and delightful: in short, if I could find a quiet <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> place to the other qualities our lodging has I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be quite right and certain to improve much in a day or two.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am going on pretty well, and really rather improving, in spite of my extreme bad luck in regard to sleep,&#x2014;1&#xBD; hour, 3 hours, 6 d<hi rend="italic">o,</hi> my respective allowances since the time you last heard. I have, for the last 2 nights, changed with Neuberg, who has a much quieter place, and who can sleep in any place, indifferent like a stone: one way and other, I will manage the remaining 2 nights; and on Monday we come away.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote on Sat.</note> This Town is the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> bathing-quarters I ever saw; many excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> lodgings in it too, and I have no doubt one might be got of feasibly quiet character. This present, <hi rend="italic">except</hi> for noise, is first-rate. Poor Jane, tho&#x2019; much disturbed too in her own premises, and still more by anxieties ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> mine, is evidently getting good, the element is otherwise so perfect, the sea so beautiful and pure, the air so fresh, all things so good. One might have a very nice House here; I believe, by making proper examinations;&#x2014;away on the Hilltop, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think, the lodgings must be quieter than here. The last two Nights I have sat serene, twice over, in Neuberg&#x2019;s balcony in Bedford Sq<hi rend="italic">re,</hi> and smoked under the moon and over the slowly swinging sea. Beautiful if one were well!&#x2014;</p>
   <p>Mrs Ross (&#x201C;Kate Sterling&#x201D; that was) is here with her Husband, in a very sickly way,&#x2014;we think nervous rather than yet pulmonary.

Hanbury Williams says of her: &#x201C;Before she came here, she was reckoned to meddle much in politics, and to be in the French interest. She denies all this herself, and declares against women&#x2019;s meddling in state affairs; but I will venture to prophesy, that if ever the Prince Electoral should outlive his father, she will govern this country most absolutely&#x201D; (Hanbury Williams, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 2:218).</note> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to have the <hi rend="italic">reference</hi> (page &#x26;c) to that, in case of need,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it is not credible to me, except in a sense.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hanbury Williams alleged that the king was having an affair with his own da., Maria Anna Sophia (<date when="1728-00-00">1728</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797-00-00">97</date>), who m., also <date when="1747-00-00">1747</date>, Maximilian III (<date when="1727-00-00">1727</date>&#x2013;<date when="1777-00-00">77</date>), elector of Bavaria. &#x201C;He [the king] has had a great loss in the Electress of Bavaria being married, for she often came to him in the afternoon, and they have been surprised together in very indecent postures. The Queen knew this, and was furious about it. She complained of it to her confessor, but the good jesuit told her, that, since things were so, it was much better that the King&#x2019;s affections should remain in his own family, than be fixed upon a stranger, who might be a Lutheran and do prejudice to their holy religion; and thus the holy casuist appeased her angry Majesty. &#x2F; The whole court is now gaping to see who will succeed the Electress; for his Majesty&#x2019;s Constitution requires somebody beside the Queen. &#x2026; When [Maria Antonia, his da.-in-law] first came, she had flattered herself with hopes of succeeding the Electress, and attacked the King the first night, but without success&#x201D; (Hanbury Williams, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 2:213&#x2013;17).

<p>The sight of your handwriting is again welcome to me; thanks for all the friendlinessess it has been the sign of to me, first and last. I will look into the Piozzi,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hester Lynch Piozzi (<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>), writer; <hi rend="italic">Observations and Reflections made in the course of a Journey through France, Italy, and Germany,</hi> 2 vols.

We saw the spot he sate in at the moment &#x2026; his servants wept as they repeated the particulars, caressing while they spoke his favourite dogs, one of which, a terrier, could hardly be prevailed upon to quit the body&#x201D; (Piozzi 2:360). For TC&#x2019;s description of Frederick&#x2019;s death, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:296&#x2013;98.</note></p>
<p>By this post I send you a couple of German volumes; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are not good for much anywhere, and are good for nothing <hi rend="italic">here</hi> or like to be, but wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> may amuse a leisure hour to you who have such.

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Sir,</hi></salute>
<p>There is something so truly hospitable in the tone of your letter, something so human-looking and salutary in the adventure proposed me, that I decide on attempting it;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Autumn <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>, I made a visit of four or five weeks to Sir George Sinclair at Thurso. &#x2026; My head had an unpleasant cloudy feeling; I was certainly far from well, far below my average of illness even. Brother John, who lived in his Brompton lodgings then, recommended strongly a sea-voyage; voyage to Thurso, for example, whither the hospitable Sir George Sinclair had been again, perhaps for the third or fourth time, eagerly inviting me. Nothing else being so feasible, and something being clearly indispensable, we both set off, John volunteering to escort me to Wick; and generously and effectively performing that fraternal service&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s headnote in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:25&#x2013;26).</note> and mean actually to embark in the Aberdeen steamer, on Wednesday, <date when="1860-08-01">August 1</date><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Aberdeen Steam Navigation Company advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1860-07-20">20 July</date>: &#x201C;fast, powerful, and commodious steamships City of London or Earl of Aberdeen leave <hi rend="small-caps">london</hi> for <hi rend="small-caps">aberdeen</hi> &#x2026; weather, &#x26;c. permitting.&#x201D; TC traveled on the <hi rend="italic">Earl of Aberdeen,</hi> <date when="1860-08-01">1 Aug.</date> at 1 p.m.</note> (that is to-morrow week), sea voyaging being much <pb id="pg-36-151" n="36:151"/>more supportable at all times than the horrors of railwaying, vainly attempting sleep in inns, &#x26;c., &#x26;c.; and shall hope to be at Wick,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Port and town in Caithness, NE Scotland, 21 mi.

<p>Most likely I shall write again before sailing; in the meantime I have only to bid you thank the beneficent Lady<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Catherine Camilla Sinclair.</note> in my name, and say that I have good hope her angelic intentions will succeed upon me in some measure, and thus it will be a welcome help indeed. That, for the rest, my domestic habits are all for simplicity and composure (<hi rend="italic">simplex munditiis</hi> [plain neatness] the motto in all things), that I live, with clear preference where possible, on rustic farm-produce,&#x2014;&#x201C;milk and meal,&#x201D; eggs, chickens, moor-mutton; white fish (salmon, veal, lamb, three things tabooed to me); reckon an innocent bread-pudding the very acme of culinary art; am accustomed to say, &#x201C;Can all the Udes<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis Eustache Ude (d. <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), chef to Louis XVI.

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Sir</hi>,</salute>
<p>Your note has come this morning; thanks once more. I write a line, as at any rate I intended, merely to say that the purpose holds; that I am booked for the Aberdeen steamer, Wednesday 1 p.m.; thence to Wick by the old program;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600803-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-08-03">3 Aug.</date></ref></note> and that I hope to cut across, if all prosper, and find you at Thurso Castle some time on Saturday,&#x2014;and there to lie down and sleep for I know not how long! If sleep do not come, you will have to shove me on to Inverness, into the current of railways;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date> there were no railways north of Inverness, ca. 110 mi. S of Thurso. The Inverness to Wick line, begun <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>, was not completed until <date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>.</note> and I must go further again, were it only to fare <hi rend="italic">worse.</hi> A brother of mine now here, Dr. Carlyle, physician once in Rome,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle practiced in Rome <date when="1836-11-00">Nov. 1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-04-00">April 1837</date>; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370119-TC-JCHA-01"><sic>9:122</sic><corr>TC to JCHA, <date when="1837-01-19">19 Jan. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x26;c., but in late years, especially in late months, a wandering man,&#x2014;will escort me to Aberdeen, perhaps to Wick; intending to &#x201C;see the Orkneys, the Shetlands,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Orkney Islands&#x2019; southernmost point is 10 mi. from John o&#x2019; Groats, the northernmost point of the Scottish mainland; they extend 50 mi. The Shetland Islands are about 50 mi. further NNE. The ship from Aberdeen to Wick continued on to Kirkwall and Lerwick, the main towns of Orkney and Shetland respectively.</note> <pb id="pg-36-154" n="36:154"/>or I know not what. My Wife cannot get away at present, nor for a week or two coming.</p>
<p>She is naturally much gratified by your repeated invitation; and has often spoken of Thurso since it was first heard of here: but she cannot <hi rend="italic">sail</hi> at all; and apart from her domestic enterprises here, which induce the desire rather of my <hi rend="italic">absence</hi> for a couple of weeks, she shudders somewhat at the long 600 miles of land-journey, even cut into sections; and dare not even undertake for Edinburgh till I have reported of myself from the Far North.</p>
<p>You need not reckon me quite an <hi rend="italic">invalid,</hi> after all. My sleeping faculty has returned, or is evidently returning, to the old imperfect degree: but my work, but my head&#x2014; In short, I was seldom in my life more worn out to utter weariness; or had more need of lying down for a little rest, under hopeful conditions. In haste (as usual),</p>

I have seldom seen such an overcrowded piggery of a place as we had to try that latter operation in. I did manage a little, however, each night,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The very first night, in spite of the tumults of the crowded Aberdeen steamer, and such a huddle of a sleeping-place as is only seen at sea, I slept deep for six or seven hours; and had not again, during this visit, nor for years, any real misery about sleep&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s headnote in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:26).</note>&#x2014;John missed altogether the first night.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

Thank God, we are got so far with success. Could I only hear that my poor Jeannie is a little come round again, now that the noises &#x26; disturbances from my side of the House are done.</p>
<p>A Steamer (I hope &#x26; believe) sails some time this day for Wick;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Prince Consort</hi> sailed at 4 p.m.</note> is expected to arrive in 9 hours after,&#x2014;very <hi rend="italic">early</hi> in the morning (4 or 2 a.m. perhaps); so soon as any landsman is up, I will try to get some gig, do the remaining 21 miles; and so be received into the arms of hospitable Thurso. So be it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This morning I have seen Dunottar Castle Ruins<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dunnottar Castle, Aberdeenshire, 2 mi. S of Stonehaven and 15 mi.

<p>You can tell Miss Ferrar<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Annie Louisa Farrer.</note> she will have an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> ship &#x26;c; but this week (mine), and next week (hers),<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Aberdeen Steam Navigation Company&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">City of London,</hi> Wed. <date when="1860-08-08">8 Aug.</date></note> they say, are the two most crowded in the year.</p>

      <salute>Dear Jeannie mine,&#x02014;</salute>
      You heard from John that I was off hither on Saturday (out of Wick, safe, and mackintoshed ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the rain); and the day before <hi rend="italic">this</hi> comes, you will receive from my respectable Host a signal that I am safe here, and making some attempt to &#x0201C;do well.&#x0201D;&#x02014; Saturday, wet, dreary, gaunt and strange, was a little dispiriting in spite of the cordial and eager welcome of all these good people: but that night I had a capital sleep; next morning I contrived to shirk &#x0201C;Church &#x26;c&#x0201D; (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I shall always do), and walked along the many-sounding shore, with a Book, a Cape, and a little tobacco, some mile or two among the cliffs and crags (a charming walk, all <hi rend="italic">grass</hi> and level, if you like to keep atop; at the <hi rend="italic">bottom</hi> of the cliffs, it is firm strata of slate flags, a little tumbled, but safe and comfortable, that too),&#x02014;not a human being visible, only the grand ever-moaning sea (Pentland Frith,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">The Pentland Firth separates the Scottish mainland from the Orkney Islands.</note> clear as crystal) with Orkney &#x0201C;Hoy Island,&#x0201D; a very fine precipitous seagirt mountain to one&#x02019;s left,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">The cliffs of Hoy reach 1,140 ft., with their highest point 1,565 ft.</note> and Dunnett Head<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Dunnet Head is the northernmost point of mainland Scotland.</note> (d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o,</hi> a quasi <hi rend="italic">Jonny Grote&#x02019;s</hi>)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">John o&#x02019; Groats is at the NE tip of Scotland, approx. 17 mi. from Thurso; for details of the house and legend, see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600902-TC-LS-01">TC to <sic>Lady S</sic>

<p><salute>Dear Sister,&#x2014;</salute>You have written to me at least twice; and I have answered nothing, calculating that John w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> answer the essential: indeed I have been reduced to such a pass lately as I hardly knew in my life before,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">head</hi> heavy-laden, sounding like a <hi rend="italic">mill;</hi> sleep quite gone; the burble of things like to drag me down altogether;&#x2014;so that I knew [not]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> what to resolve on; and could not &#x201C;write&#x201D; to any purpose. One thing only was apparent, that I could not too soon get out of London. So <hi rend="italic">here</hi> I am; by what route, by what conveyances and adventures, you doubtless know; for I saw John writing to you &#x201C;Off <pb id="pg-36-162" n="36:162"/>Aberdeen&#x201D; while [we]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> were still in the Steamer; and probably he has written from Wick (20 miles off this) since I left him on Saturday.</p>
<p>Poor fellow, he was very good to me, and really very useful and comfortable all the way; and it was a grievous sorrow to me, but an unavoidable, to roll away from him, so far from home partly for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sake, on Saturday in the rain! I think he will certainly strike off southward, tomorrow (Tuesday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) by the Return Steamer;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Prince Consort</hi> left Wick for Edinburgh on Tues. mornings, but John A. Carlyle went south by road; he wrote, [<date when="1860-08-05">5 Aug.</date>]: &#x201C;Wick, Sunday &#x2F; I mean to start today at one o&#x2019;clock with the mail [coach] which goes south. &#x2026; I have exhausted this place, &#x26; cannot go about alone for sight-seeing at a distance.&#x201D;</note> and I hope to hear of him turning up among you, after his solitary long months. Few things w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give me greater pleasure than to hear of his having cast anchor, got himself a house &#x26;c,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had made an offer for a house in Dumfriesshire the previous year; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18591113-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1859-11-13">13 Nov. 1859</date></ref>.</note> and got some <hi rend="italic">root</hi> of natural human comfort and arrang<hi rend="italic">t</hi> planted for himself in this world again!-</p>
<p>This is a very pleasant wholesome place, and certainly one of the <hi rend="italic">quietest</hi> in all the world. A queer old Mansion, nothing of the Castle in it but four or five <pb id="pg-36-163" n="36:163"/>little <hi rend="italic">extinguisher</hi> towers<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Towers shaped like candle snuffers.</note> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the corners; built close to the Northern Ocean, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> never goes a gunshot off, but moans perpetually and sounds among its rocks close under one of my windows here: a biggish House taken all together; well done up, well furnished and managed; the people all in the highest degree zealous to accommodate the surprising monster who has been stranded among them. I have one of the desirablest nice rooms in the world; looks upon Thurso chimney-tops one way, and out upon the great ocean on the other: from cocks, Carpenters, hackney-cabs, what a change! I have already had two quite respectable sleeps, and the dirty burden in the head seems going gradually. I breakfast an hour <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the family; and am not to shew face till 3 p.m.&#x2014;excellent! I hope even to do some <hi rend="italic">work;</hi> but this is only the first day of it, and I must not brag. &#x201C;Sir George,&#x201D; a fine pious-minded stiff-backed old man of 70; two hearty daughters (near 40 I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> guess),<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emilia Power, age 43, and Olivia, age 37.</note> and a nervous Mother,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Camilla.</note> who is good, but ever-ailing, and does not appear except at dinner: that is our party.&#x2014; I must break off abruptly.

<p>I quitted London a week ago, <hi rend="italic">nolens volens</hi> [willy nilly], things being very bad with me;&#x2014;and I receive your hospitable Note<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes had written, <date when="1860-08-03">3 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Will you &#x26; Mrs Carlyle take us on your way north. &#x2026; I heard the other day of an invitation &#x2026; given by an officer to a friend&#x2014; &#x2018;Come &#x26; stay with us as long as you can&#x2014;you shall have an ocean of liquor, a plantation of tobacco, &#x26; a large room to swear in&#x2019;&#x2014; I make you the same offer&#x2014;only you&#x2019;d better bring your own plantation&#x2014;&#x2F; Mrs Carlyle shall have her quiet room to herself.&#x201D;</note> <hi rend="italic">here</hi> (looking out upon the precipitous cliffs of Orkney, Dunnet&#x2019;s Head, the Old Man of Hoy,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An isolated column of shale capped with sandstone, 450 ft. high, off the cliffs of Hoy.</note> the Northern Ocean, and <hi rend="italic">ultima Thule</hi>),&#x2014;already in slightly improved circumstances; able to <hi rend="italic">sleep,</hi> for one thing, the billows and the winds rocking me.

<p>My Wife is still in Chelsea; uncertain whether I shall be able to persuade her into Scotland at all, much more <hi rend="italic">hither</hi> (600 and more miles away),&#x2014;tho&#x2019; <pb id="pg-36-164" n="36:164"/>she too, if she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> own it, has much need of country. If on my or <hi rend="italic">our</hi> return (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is as yet quite dateless) I pass within wind of Fryston, doubt not I shall be right glad to see it again, in the name of the Past and of the Future,&#x2014;of the former, at any rate, ah me!</p>
<p>Are not you a shocking fellow, never to ask once this year whether I was alive or dead, or whether the Devils had left me in a dog&#x2019;s likeness or a man&#x2019;s:&#x2014;for shame! However, you can do nothing to provoke me utterly; and I must love R. M. actually more or less, as I do no other, or hardly one, however he may behave.</p>
<p>With many regards to the Hon. Lady, and best wishes to the two Bairns,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard and Annabella Milnes had three children.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am very happy to hear of you the second time,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1860-08-05">5 Aug.</date>, that he would send another letter when he had an address.</note> and that you have got your staff set up at least for one week. I hope you will do well at Bridge of Allan,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A small spa town 2&#xBD; mi. NW of Stirling.</note> and be clearer for your future movements after a good week&#x2019;s repose, when various clouds will have sunk down into the form of <hi rend="italic">sediment</hi> in your mind. I know not well where the place is; but will seek it out tomorrow when I have daylight again.&#x2014; On Saturday Night, before going to bed, I wrote you a line; and walked into Thurso with it next morning in time for the post. It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> reach the <hi rend="italic">Caledonian H&#xF4;tel</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hotel in Wick where John had stayed on his way south.</note> some hours after your departure; the Coach you went in had brought it to the Post-Office, had you known. Pray send for it <hi rend="italic">immediately;</hi> you will see why I wish it <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> at least, if not safe in your hands! It was written rather in ill spirits; and I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not wish it read quite at the market-cross in this particular part of the country<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The letter is untraced, presumably burned.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Since that point I have gone on pretty steadily mending, doing tolerably well in spite of the continual showers we have: I have adjusted my hours to a fixed method; am called at 8, breakfast by myself at 9 (a full hour before the family); work among my papers here all morning; rush out rather before <pb id="pg-36-165" n="36:165"/>2 p. m. for a bathe (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is always procurable by industry on some smooth patch of the tumbled crags and flags, water pure as crystal); and rush home again to be ready for dinner ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 3. Dressing has to be done; but I do it with a brevity you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> admire,&#x2014;in 5 minutes or little more. These last 2 days I have actually got some fractions of work done! I have slept too; <hi rend="italic">well</hi> one time; not ill, any time. My dinner is white fish and chicken, bread for vegetables; one glass of sherry, and an honest farinaceous pudding to wind up with:&#x2014;mainly a milk-and-meal diet, the wholesomest for me that c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be. After dinner they go driving; I, well wrapt, solitary, with tobacco, on the &#x201C;rumble,&#x201C;&#x2014;for a 3 or 2 hours: this, with walking, is I hope wholesome too. In short I believe I can probably hold on for certain weeks,&#x2014;say till <date when="1860-08-00">Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi></date> end;&#x2014;and find the process beneficial. They are excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> innocent people, anxious all of them to oblige me,&#x2014;ungrateful that I am! I have shirked &#x201C;Prayers&#x201D; to write this.&#x2014; No word from Jane yet, except some scratch on the back of a Letter she was forwarding.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC wrote two brief notes, <date when="1860-08-04">4 Aug.</date>, the first on the back of RMM to TC, <date when="1860-08-03">3 Aug.</date></note>&#x2014; Adieu, dear Brother: write soon. <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley</salute>
<p>On finding your portrait when I came down yesterday morning, I felt so <hi rend="italic">excited,</hi> and so grateful, that I wanted to rush off to Dover Street,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Lady Stanley&#x2019;s London home was.</note> so soon as you could be imagined <hi rend="italic">up</hi> and dressed, to thank you more <hi rend="italic">warmly</hi> than one can possibly do on paper! also&#x2014;to ask if it were purely on &#x201C;the voluntary principle&#x201D; that you had sent it? or if the expressions of my passionate desire to have one had been conveyed to you by Annie Farrer? If the latter was the state of the fact:, I shall write myself down <hi rend="italic">her</hi> debtor for a most acceptable kindness: besides feeling <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> as grateful to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> as if you had given me the Portrait without prompting! I was going on to say, that my wish and purpose to see you yesterday were knocked on the head by a note which came by the morning post, promising me the visit of a dear old married couple from my native place!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William and Jane Dods from Haddington.</note> They followed their note within an hour, and stayed to dinner with me, and when they had left I could do nothing but sit and break my heart over &#x201C;dear old long ago&#x201D;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s phrase, used mainly in reference to her youth in Haddington; cf. <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590303-JWC-BB-01"><sic>35:49</sic><corr>JWC to BB, <date when="1859-03-03">3 March 1859</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; I showed them the portrait however; and the man showed his good taste by declaring you &#x201C;a lovely woman, that one would like to&#x2014;kiss&#x201D;!!

<p>If you only knew the mess I am in, you would feel, (I think) that you did a charitable as well as kind thing in sending that bit of sunshine into the house!

<salute>My dear Sir</salute>
<p>Decidedly, you are more thoughtful for me than the man who is bound by vow to &#x201C;love and cherish&#x201D; me!

<p>Well!&#x2014;now that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have relieved me from all anxiety about the effects of the journey on him, he may write at his own &#x201C;reasonably good leisure.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490707-JWC-TC-01"><sic>24:104</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1849-07-07">7 July 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note> Only&#x2014;I told him I should not write till I had heard of his arrival&#x2014;from himself<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600804-JWC-TC-01">her first letter to TC, [<date when="1860-08-04">4 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">he knows</hi> whether or no I am in the habit of keeping my word&#x2014;to the letter!</p>
<p>A thousand thanks for the primrose roots&#x2014;which I shall plant so soon as it fairs;&#x2014;to day we have again a deluge! adding a deeper shade of horror to <pb id="pg-36-168" n="36:168"/>certain household operations going on under my inspection&#x2014;(by way of &#x201C;improving the occasion&#x201C;&#x2014;of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> absence!)&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">One</hi> Bedroom has got all the feathers of its bed and pillows airing themselves out on the floor! creating an atmosphere of down over the house more choking than even &#x201C;cotton-fuzz&#x201D;!&#x2014;In another; plasterers and painters are plashing away for their life!&#x2014;and a couple of Bricklayers are tearing up flags in the kitchen to seek &#x201C;the Solution&#x201C;&#x2014;of a non-acting drain!&#x2014; All this on the one hand, and on the other; visits from my D<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> resulting in ever new &#x201C;composing draughts,&#x201D; and strict charges to &#x201C;keep my mind perfectly tranquil&#x201D;!

<p>Pray <hi rend="italic">do</hi> keep him as long as you like! to hear of him &#x201C;in high spirits&#x201D; and &#x201C;looking remarkably well&#x201D; is more composing for me than any amount of &#x201C;composing draughts,&#x201D; or of insistance on the benefits of &#x201C;keeping myself perfectly tranquil&#x201D;! It is so very different a state of things with him from that in which I have <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> him for a long time back!</p>

<p>You will infer from my going a-head against &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">noises</hi>&#x201D; on my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> account, that the &#x201C;extraordinary disturbance of the nervous system&#x201D; which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes found me suffering under when he came, has not yielded yet to an equally extraordinary amount of &#x201C;Composing Mixture&#x201D;!

George Gilfillan, an old admirer of TC, had pbd. a recent edn. with a memoir and &#x201C;critical dissertation,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">The Poetical Works of Matthew Prior</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>) 430.</note> till I ended in lying awake the whole nights thro! not what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> call &#x201C;awake&#x201C;&#x2014;that is, <hi rend="italic">dozing&#x2014;</hi>but broad-wide awake&#x2014;like a hawk, with an empty stomach! Still the mixture was to be persevered in&#x2014;nay increased&#x2014; And I was assured it was &#x201C;doing me <hi rend="italic">a little</hi> good&#x201C;&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">So little</hi> I myself couldn&#x2019;t perceive it; even thro&#x2019; the powerful microscope of my faith in M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes! And in spite of his assurance that &#x201C;home was the best place for me at present,&#x201D; I had wild impulses to &#x201C;take the road&#x201D; (like &#x201C;the D<hi rend="italic">r,</hi>&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

The night before last however, (Wednesday night), I fell into a deep natural sleep which lasted two hours, and might have lasted till the Masons<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the bricklayers working in the kitchen.</note> began, but for the Cheesemongers Dog which was <hi rend="italic">out</hi> that night (bad luck to it!) on a spree; and startled me awake at three of the morning with furious continuous barking; just as if my head was being laid open with repeated strokes of a hatchet! Of course I &#x201C;slept no more&#x201D;!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 2.2.</note>&#x2014;and yesterday was too ill for anything, except, as I have said, writing a wild appeal to the Cheesemonger&#x2014; I will inclose his comforting answer, which he handed in himself an hour after&#x2014; It will be comforting to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> also&#x2014;in reference to your own future nights.</p>
<p>I have nothing to tell that you will take any interest in&#x2014;except about the Horse.

<p><salute>My dear Jean&#x2014;</salute>. &#x2026; I will inclose you a Note I had from Sir George Sinclair, which will put you in heart about Mr. C.&#x2019;s situation up there. Even from the one Letter I have had from himself since his arrival, it appears that his circumstances are as favourable for the purposes he had in view as could have well been found in a conditional world. I trust in God he will get calmed down, by a good long stay there; and come back with a thicker skin than he took away! This Book has been far <hi rend="italic">too long</hi> a piece of work for him,&#x2014;to say nothing of its difficulty.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know what I am going to do with <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> yet. His nervous state had acted upon me, till I was become more sleepless and agitated than himself! And I was on the verge of complete break-down into serious illness when Mr. C. left, and my Doctor took me in hands. To judge from the amount of &#x201C;composing draughts&#x201D; given me (three in a day!), I must have been very near boiling over and blowing my lid off! He (the Doctor) forbade my leaving home for the present; and I shall await his permission before going anywhere. He is both a skilful and honest man, and would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> keep me here for the sake of running up a bill!&#x2014; But I do feel a great longing to be on the top of a hill somewhere, to breathe more freely.&#x2014; I will tell you my plans when I have any. What a nice little woman Mrs. Symington is! I liked her much better than <hi rend="italic">him.</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Symington and Mary Sanderson Edmonston had m. <date when="1860-07-23">23 July</date> and were presumably on a wedding trip.</note> James<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Aitken.</note> might have called and reported himself at Cheyne Row. But I find him, socially speaking, a most impracticable youth! I wish he could fall in <pb id="pg-36-172" n="36:172"/>love!

    <salute>Dear Lady Sandwich,</salute>
    <p>I send you a word, to keep myself in your Memory, from this remote part of the Earth,&#x02014;with the Orkney Islands and <hi rend="italic">Ultima Thule</hi> close in sight. I think we left London the same day, Wednesday gone a week; you, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> fain flatter myself, are safe at Hinchinbrook ever since that afternoon, and doing well: my journey did not end till Saturday next; and landed me 700 miles away, very much like a lost sheep. However, the good people have not butchered me, <pb id="pg-36-174" n="36:174" />but been very kind to me; and I am doing rather well than otherwise on this strange foreign shore</p>
    <p>Our &#x0201C;Thurso Castle&#x0201D; (a queer old Scotch edifice, with <hi rend="italic">extinguisher</hi> turrets, peaked gables &#x26;c, &#x0201C;built by the Earls of Caithness two centuries ago&#x0201D;) hangs over the very edge of the Pentland Frith, the voice of the waves never ceasing from these windows of mine; and, in point of &#x0201C;solitude,&#x0201D; and of certain other requisitions I am often making, leaves nothing to be desired;-for we are withal the quietest family in Britain (I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think); the Head of us a good old gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of 70, busied mainly with his own desultory readings, in many languages;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">&#x0201C;Sir George was abundantly conversible, anecdotic, far-read, far-experienced, indeed a quite learned man (would read me lyrics &#x26;c., straight from the Greek, any evening, nothing pleased him better)&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s headnote in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:26). According to Grant, Sinclair&#x02019;s &#x0201C;aptitude &#x02026; for acquiring a knowledge of languages was so great that before he had attained his thirtieth year he was thoroughly master of seven foreign languages, in several of which he could not only converse with the greatest ease and propriety, but could write with an accuracy which natives of the respective countries could hardly surpass&#x0201D; (Grant, <hi rend="italic">Sir George Sinclair</hi> 19).</note> and cultivating no society, in the common sense of the word, but rather avoiding it; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> suits me like wise very well. Not to say that they grant me the high privilege of being <hi rend="italic">strictly invisible</hi> till 3 p. m, when dinner is; and let me vanish again at any time when I like! By starting early in the morning, <pb id="pg-36-175" n="36:175" />and standing steadily to my tools, I generally manage to get a little work done, every day, and to have a bathe in this loud-sounding sea, and a great deal of walking and sauntering, mainly by the shore of it, where for miles I meet no creature, except perhaps at great intervals a cow or pony. The shores are exceedingly picturesque too, in their grim style; Orkney (the &#x0201C;Old Man of Hoy&#x0201D; always in sight) is a most precipitous rock-bound country; Dunnet Head d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o;&#x02014;</hi>and we are within a few hours driving of &#x0201C;John O&#x02019;Groat&#x02019;s House&#x0201D; (and are even <hi rend="italic">nearer</hi> the Pole than it): what w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> one desire more?

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley,</salute>
<p>I venture to hope that my mistake in supposing you still here is ascribable to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s confusion of speech that day, rather than to my own dullness of understanding! He <hi rend="italic">did</hi> tell me he had called at Dover Street, and found &#x201C;a cab or rather cabs at the door, taking away <hi rend="italic">certain maids</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the two youngest Stanley das., Katherine and Rosalind.</note> and <hi rend="italic">such like things</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (as I understood him) were not going&#x2014;&#x201C;not just yet.&#x201D; <pb id="pg-36-182" n="36:182"/>Certainly he didn&#x2019;t know too well what he was saying that day, or for several days, before his departure in the Aberdeen Steamer!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC left for Thurso <date when="1860-08-01">1 Aug.</date></note> I never saw him in such a state of nervous excitement&#x2014;which is much to say!</p>
<p>But he seems to be getting calmed down at Thurso Castle. Old Sir George writes to me that his &#x201C;dear and valued friend and guest&#x201D; sleeps much better, and is &#x201C;the delight of all their hearts&#x201D; (Oh <hi rend="italic">my!</hi>) so, it is hoped I will &#x201C;lend him to them till the beginning of <date when="1860-10-00">October</date>&#x201D;!&#x2014; And M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C himself expresses mild contentment with his lot up there. Even the Lady Camilla, of whom he had had fears, appears to him &#x201C;a good female soul, heavy-laden with nerves, and many other things&#x201D;!! And so I hope it may be considered settled that he will stay where he is till <date when="1860-10-00">October</date>, which will allow <hi rend="italic">me</hi> time to get his rooms made nice and bright, and to grow a new skin over my nervous system! I shall give him your message&#x2014;for, he is always glad of a message from you whether its behest be practicable or not. But his idea, when he left, was to sail straight back, as he went.</p>
<p>As for me, I have been feeling very much like a flock of Turkeys, at a dead halt, for want of dangling a bit of red clout before them!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the turkeys and the red cloth, see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580817-JWC-TC-01"><sic>34:136</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1858-08-17">17 Aug. 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note> Thurso Castle, to be reached by spinning over six hundred miles of railway, presided over by an unseen Lady Camilla &#x201C;heavy-laden with nerves, and many other things,&#x201D; does not amount to a red-clout attraction at all!&#x2014; I have negatived that proposal. Even the South of Scotland, where I staid last year till I got tired of every body and every thing, <hi rend="italic">feels</hi> too far off, and otherwise uninviting. I have thought of Lodgings at this and the other sea-place&#x2014;and actually looked for Lodgings at Richmond. But when it came to a practical decision, &#x201C;horrible was the idea to me&#x201D;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440912-TC-JWC-01"><sic>18:201</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1844-09-12">12 Sept. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>So here I am likely to remain, &#x201C;solitary as owl in desert,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 102:6.</note> and up to the ears in &#x201C;household good&#x201C;&#x2014;that is to say feathers, new paint &#x26;c!&#x2014; Unless indeed, as is not to be hoped, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have a prospect of continuing some time longer &#x201C;quite alone, and rather dull,&#x201D; with no new books or any thing to divert your mind. Under which impossible possible state of things, I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> take advantage of your kind words about coming to Alderley,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alderley Park, Cheshire, the Stanleys&#x2019; country house, ca. 12 mi. S of Manchester.</note> and stream off to you, out of this, <hi rend="italic">for a few days.</hi> I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> I could <hi rend="italic">divert your mind</hi> as well as most of the new books that come under my notice! And I should not think it too far to go &#x201C;on purpose,&#x201D; to walk with <hi rend="italic">you</hi> under shelter of trees, and talk with you, without callers interrupting, or a carriage waiting in the street to snatch you <pb id="pg-36-183" n="36:183"/>away, like&#x2014;Proserpine<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Roman mythology, Proserpine, the da. of Ceres, was snatched away by Pluto to the underworld.</note>&#x2014; But I am afraid you wont see your way to any more days of <hi rend="italic">aloneness</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rather-dullness;</hi> which state of things constitutes the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> colour of the clout dangled before my Turkey-intellect&#x2014;in the direction of Alderley.</p>
<p>I trust there is nothing materially wrong with the <hi rend="italic">brain</hi> of &#x201C;the Ashburton Baby.&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Florence Baring.</note> I saw it the day before yesterday, sucking most vigourously, with its long dark hair &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all about</hi>&#x201D;! a most queer little creature to look at! picturesque to a degree!&#x2014;but with every appearance of health. Lady A was out, but I heard from the Groom that the Scotch journey<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Castle Brahan or Kinlochluichart; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600806-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref></note> was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> given up, but was to come off next week.</p>
<p>If the Baby&#x2019;s brain <hi rend="italic">were</hi> a little &#x201C;irritable&#x201D; as yet, it would be a very natural result of that Baby&#x2019;s fatalities! The first monthly nurse proved a disgrace to Humanity, put (only think!) some six or seven napkins to the Baby-posteriors all at once, in the morning, and left them unchanged till night! so that the poor little Posteriors became &#x201C;all inflamed and sore,&#x201D; and my <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi> (!) (not my Lady) turned her off at a moments notice! a new Monthly Nurse had to be fetched from the Grange and a wet nurse&#x2014;the Lady&#x2019;s milk having been frightened away by the row. One hoped the affairs of the nursery were settled in permanence. But what was my astonishment to find the day before yesterday every face changed! three perfectly new women! one of whom was in the act of being sucked! As Lady A was out I did not learn what had happened&#x2014;only, asking the man who showed me down; was the former nurse gone for good? he answered; &#x201C;Oh dear yes! a <hi rend="italic">new lot</hi> came in last night&#x201D;! Poor wee Baby!&#x2014;who can say what irritating effects all these new faces may have on its bit brain! I declare I could have found in my heart to undertake the suckling of it myself! were the giving of milk, as Dr Livingston and others make out, a pure act of <hi rend="italic">volition!!</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Livingstone (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>; <ref target="volume-36/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16803"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), explorer and missionary, described several instances of women without young children nevertheless producing milk when a child was put to the breast; he also suggested &#x201C;that the story &#x2026; of a man, during the time of persecution in Scotland, putting his child to his own breast, and finding &#x2026; that milk followed the act, may have been literally true&#x201D;; see <hi rend="italic">Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa</hi> (<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>) 127.</note></p>
<p>I am very pleased that the Portrait was &#x201C;all out of your own head&#x201C;&#x2014;and very pleased at your letter&#x2014;and <closer><salute>very faithfully yours</salute></closer></p>

Indeed I had no reason to expect anything of the sort, having been sleeping better, and feeling better in every way, for the last week. I rather &#x201C;happrehend&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; an expression of Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s butler, Wills; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470324-TC-LHB-01"><sic>21:187</sic><corr>TC to LHB, <date when="1847-03-24">24 March 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> it was my own imprudence in taking a glass of bitter ale to supper that caused this deadly sickness and&#x2014;other things.</p>
<p>Trust me for doing the best for myself, in the circumstances. I am the last person to let myself be humbugged by a D<hi rend="italic">r&#x2014;</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes was perfectly right in ordering me at the time you left to put all ideas of travelling out of my head, and &#x201C;go to <hi rend="italic">bed</hi> for two hours every forenoon, instead.&#x201D; And the mixture which for many days failed in its intended effect, on account (he said) of the excitement I was in, got to do me palpable, unmistakeable good at last, and is now discontinued by his own order&#x2014; At the time you left I was hanging on the verge of nervous fever, and have made a very near miss of it!</p>
<p>He does not disapprove of my going away <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> provided I keep short of fatigue or excitement&#x2014;and I am taking steps towards forming a programme&#x2014; I will tell you in a day or two what direction I have decided on&#x2014;</p>
<p>I should like very well to spend a day or so at The Gill, but a stay of any length <hi rend="italic">there</hi> would not suit <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at all. <hi rend="italic">Milk</hi> is no object, as it is not strong enough food for my present weak appetite&#x2014;and solitude is positively hurtful to <hi rend="italic">me&#x2014;</hi> Human kindness is precious every where, and nobody appreciates it <pb id="pg-36-185" n="36:185"/>more than I do&#x2014; But just the kinder they are, the more I should be tempted to overexert myself in <hi rend="italic">talking</hi> and putting my contentmen<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> in evidence. In short this would be a <hi rend="italic">strain</hi> upon me, while I was supposed to be enjoying the hight<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> of freedom! I mean were my stay prolonged beyond the day or two that the enthusiasm of meeting after long absence and <hi rend="italic">having things to tell one another</hi> holds out&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am so sorry to have to put you off with such a scrubby letter&#x2014;but the carriage will be here before I am dressed and here is my beef-tea my first breakfast. Kind love to Sir George</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I havn&#x2019;t leisure to commence this letter with reproaches, for the reproaches would be very long! and my time for writing is very short! In an hour hence a carriage will come to take me to a sick old Lady<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Sandwich; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600816-JWC-LST-01">JWC to <sic>Lady Stanley</sic><corr>LST</corr>, [ca. <date when="1860-08-16">16 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;I myself being quite as sick, and nearly as old!&#x2014;and there are directions to be given to diverse workmen before I start. For M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is absent&#x2014;and I have taken the opportunity of turning a carpenter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Mr. Parsons or Joseph Morgan; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580714-TC-JWC-01"><sic>34:43</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-14">14 July 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note> and a painter,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> and a paperhanger<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Oliver Osborn or John Walters; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581123-JWC-JPR-01"><sic>34:244</sic><corr>JWC to JPR, <date when="1858-11-23">23 Nov. 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note> into his private appartment!</p>
<p>Yes: after repeatedly assuring you that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C would not go North this summer, but restrict his travels to some sea side place near hand&#x2014;I am almost ashamed to tell you that he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> gone &#x2018;North&#x2019; after all! and further North than he ever was in all his life before! Being on a visit to Sir George Sinclair at Thurso Castle&#x2014;the northernmost point of Scotland! A trial of Brighton had been made,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC and JWC spent <date when="1860-07-03">3</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-07-09">9 July</date> at Brighton.</note> and had ended abruptly and ignominiously, in flight back to Chelsea; to get out of the sound of certain <hi rend="italic">cocks!</hi> Of all places in the World Brighton was the last one would have expected to be infested with <hi rend="italic">poultry!</hi></p>
<p><pb id="pg-36-186" n="36:186"/>But one week of Brighton had only increased M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s desire for <hi rend="italic">sea;</hi> and indeed he had got into such a sleepless, excited condition, thro&#x2019; prolonged overwork, that there could be no doubt about the need of what they call &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a complete change</hi>&#x201D; for him. So he looked about for a sea residence, where he might be safe from <hi rend="italic">cocks,</hi> and cockneys, and decided for Thurso Castle&#x2014;which could moreover be reached by <hi rend="italic">sailing,</hi> which he prefers infinitely to railwaying&#x2014;and whence there had come a pressing invitation for us both&#x2014;to spend a couple of months. Accordingly he streamed off there a fortnight ago&#x2014;I remaing behind, for several reasons; first that <hi rend="italic">sailing</hi> is as much as my life is worth! and seven hundred miles of railway would have been just about as fatal!&#x2014; Second, if I was going to undertake a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> journey, I might take it in directions that would better repay the trouble and expense than Thurso Castle, presided over by an Unknown Lady Camilla; my only friend there, Sir George himself more good than interesting!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude omitted from &#x201C;than&#x201D; to &#x201C;interesting,&#x201D; presumably to protect the feelings of Lady Camilla and Sir George&#x2019;s children.</note> And third; the long worry and anxiety I had had with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s nervousness had reduced myself to the brink of a nervous fever&#x2014;and my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> was peremptory as to the unfitness of my either going with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, or rejoining him at Thurso&#x2014; Indeed I was not to leave home at all, in the state I was in&#x2014;but to take three <hi rend="italic">composing draughts</hi> a-day! and go to bed for two hours every fore noon! A fortnight of this, and perfect quiet in the house has calmed me down amazingly&#x2014;only I feel as <hi rend="italic">tired</hi> as if I were just returned from &#x201C;the Thirty Years war&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>And <hi rend="italic">now</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes does not object to my going away, provided I dont go to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C !!! and dont over exert myself; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C who is already immensely improved by his residence at Thurso Castle, is all for every body &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">going into the Country,</hi>&#x201D; and has made up his mind that, like it or not, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> must go &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">instantly</hi>&#x201D; to&#x2014;The Gill! (Mary Austin&#x2019;s!)&#x2014;which as it suits <hi rend="italic">his</hi> milk-loving and solitude-loving<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude omitted &#x201C;and solitude-loving.&#x201D;</note> habits he imagines would equally suit <hi rend="italic">me!&#x2014;</hi></p>
<p>And I myself, would like very well to turn my two or three remaining weeks of liberty to some more agreeable use than superintending the house-cleaning here! But decidedly mooning about, all by myself, at <hi rend="italic">the Gill,</hi> lapping milk which doesn&#x2019;t agree with me, and being <hi rend="italic">stared at</hi> by the Gill children<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James and Mary Austin&#x2019;s six youngest children.</note> as their &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Aunt</hi>&#x201D;! is not the happy &#x201C;change&#x201D; for which I would go far! Much as I like Mary Austin, and like to speak with her&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">for a few hours!</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude omitted &#x201C;and like to speak with her&#x2014;for a few hours,&#x201D; presumably to protect Mary Austin&#x2019;s feelings.</note></p>
<p>Now, I want to know how <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are situated&#x2014; Whether the invitation held out to me and which I, &#x201C;ignorant of the Future&#x201D; declined for this year, be still open to me&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">if</hi> I had it in my power to go on to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for <hi rend="italic">a week</hi> or so, from <pb id="pg-36-187" n="36:187"/>the Gill&#x2014;I might give myself the air of a charmingly obedient wife, and agree to go <hi rend="italic">there&#x2014;</hi>without my obedience costing me any personal sacrifice. The pleasure of a week with you and the Doctor would greatly counterbalance the tedium of a week at <hi rend="italic">the Gill:</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude omitted from &#x201C;The pleasure&#x201D; to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Gill</hi>,&#x201D; to protect the Austins&#x2019; feelings.</note> And I could break the long journey by staying a few days at Alderley Park (Lord Stanleys) where I have half engaged to go in any case&#x2014;</p>
<p>But I don&#x2019;t know if you are <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> yet, or if you are not gone somewhere for change of air, yourself, or if somebody else be not located for the present in <hi rend="italic">my room!!&#x2014;</hi>and unfortunately I am tied to time&#x2014;I must be back in London some weeks before M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2014;for reasons I will explain later&#x2014;as they require time to explain them&#x2014;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile you will in any case answer me as briefly as you like by return of post?&#x2014;for I shant answer M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C till I get your letter&#x2014;</p>
<p>And I do beseech you to be perfectly frank&#x2014;to tell me if you are going anywhere or if anybody else is coming to you? or if <hi rend="italic">my room</hi> is not ready <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> or worst of all if you are poorly and can&#x2019;t be troubled. I <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> that state so thoroughly well&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Dear little Goody,&#x2014;</salute>My eyes are falling together (would yours were, for the like reason), I am so sleepy; having walked long miles, and this (11 p. m.) being now my orthodox hour of bed! But I must write you a few words, in hope of sleeping with an easier mind.</p>
<p>Your Letter greatly to my comfort, somewhat to my surprise, came yesterday morning. With a noble contempt of my industriously exact Post-Office instructions, you fell again plump into the Sunday (having written on <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>): you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have seen me on Saturday when I had accompanied Sir G. to Thurso on purpose to catch up your Letter at once, and the blank look I had when there was none!&#x2014; However all is well that ends as this did; namely, with hope, and an account which you affirm to be positive of some considerable inprove<hi rend="italic">t.</hi> Oh take care of yourself; to find you in a &#x201C;nervous fever,&#x201D; what a bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be! And tomorrow probably you will tell me what your plans for rustication, and refection of the poor frail tabernacle, are. But I shall not hear <pb id="pg-36-189" n="36:189"/>it till <hi rend="italic">night</hi> tomorrow;&#x2014;and that is partly why I write to-night. Our weather having at last shewn symptoms of becoming dry (till 2 days ago, we have had continual damp grey, with draggling showers all day and night; and such winds,&#x2014;you never heard such an uproar as the winds and the thundering Pentland billows make in their rocky caves; and there is not, so to speak, a tree in the country much less a wood or sheltering hedge. Well, the weather having taken up, an Expedit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to John O&#x2019; Groat&#x2019;s House (I believe, near 20 miles off, to eastward) has become imperative,&#x2014;appointed for tomorrow, <hi rend="italic">de rigeur;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS. &#x201C;We would warn any intending visitor to John o&#x2019; Groats, that there is positively nothing to see there, and yet we would say by all means go&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Hand-Book to Thurso</hi> 24).</note>&#x2014;and I shall have a weary bory day; and return as tired as possible. For the rest, a kind of crisis is perhaps approaching in my own affairs here; so that I long the more to hear wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> way yours point. The case is this: Yesterday I got <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with my Third Book;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC means the third book of vol. 3 of the 1st edn. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great,</hi> &#x201C;Book 13: First Silesian War&#x201D;; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 15:199&#x2013;358.</note>&#x2014;am now into that unmanageable mass (called 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> &#x26; 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Books,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The fourth book, &#x201C;Book 14: The Surrounding European War Does Not End,&#x201D; was pbd. in vol. 3, but the fifth book, &#x201C;Book 15: Second Silesian War,&#x201D; was pbd. in vol. 4.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Fuz<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster.</note> had on hand); and have <hi rend="italic">read</hi> today in it, as far as the hours went,&#x2014;with astonishment and consternation! It is doubtful whether I can do any good upon it <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> or away from the general reservoir of Books at Chelsea. I do not yet decide; but it is doubtful. In the negative case, my stay here cannot be long. Nothing but work &#x26; the comfort of seeing <hi rend="italic">some</hi> progress, keeps my imagination quiet in this inane scene,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has lately rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> the addition of 3 very little and very riotous <hi rend="italic">grand children</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles, Evelyn, Constance, and William Hope Johnstone; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600815-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1860-08-15">15 Aug.</date></ref></note> (with governess and trimmings),<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The governess and nurse were probably Violet Ingles (b. ca. <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>) and Mary Mackenzie (b. ca. <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), who were listed in the <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date> census.</note>&#x2014;two of another stock, a little older and quieter,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The children of Sinclair&#x2019;s eldest da., Emilia; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600806-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref></note> we had already, with a strange staring (&#x201C;very opulent&#x201D;) Hobbletehoy<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly John Stephen (<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1916-00-00">1916</date>), youngest son of Alexander Stephen, shipbuilder, of Broughty Ferry; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600906-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1860-09-06">6 Sept.</date></ref></note> from Dundee, who hangs upon the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Missie</hi>&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Olivia Georgina Power.</note> of these; and&#x2014;and more are expected (I think of the grown sort), for nothing can exceed the hospitality of this good man!

<p>There! what do you think of this? If you knew all; you would admit that I have as much &#x201C;courage&#x201D; as your Horse, which &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">goes whether he can or not</hi>&#x201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580704-JWC-TC-01"><sic>34:8</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1858-07-04">4 July 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>But the present is not a moment for entering into details; of how ill I was after my last letter, and of how my illness was complicated with household griefs, and of how it was necessary to leave for here at hardly a days notice, or give up altogether the idea of going anywhere All that will keep till I am in better case for writing a long letter, or even till we meet &#x201C;on our return from the thirty years war&#x201D;!</p>
<p>Enough to say, for the present; that I am here on a most kindly pressing invitation from Lady Stanley, to stay &#x201C;a week,&#x201D; and &#x201C;be nursed&#x201D; (you may be sure it was pressing enough when <hi rend="italic">I</hi> accepted it!) And that my intention is; if I get as much better as I hope to, to go on from here to The Gill, and from there, after a day or two&#x2019;s rest to Holme Hill (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell&#x2019;s). where I can remain with advantage as long as I find expedient with relation to the time of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> return home. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell had been urging me to visit them for the last three months at intervals. And I am always much made of and very comfortable there. And to have a Doctor for one&#x2019;s host was a consideration of some weight with me under the circumstances in choosing that ultimate destination. I <hi rend="italic">couldn&#x2019;t</hi> have travelled all the way to Dumfrieshire at one fell rush; but the invitation to Alderly broke the journey beautifully for me. It&#x2014;(the coming to Alderley) had been spoken of&#x2014;or rather written of by Lady S <hi rend="italic">before</hi> I last wrote to you; but I was afraid to say a word about it in case you had played <pb id="pg-36-192" n="36:192"/>me the same trick as in the case of Louisa Baring!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa Baring spoke of inviting JWC to stay with her and her sister Emily at Bay House, nr. Portsmouth, <date when="1858-07-00">July 1858</date>, but the invitation was not confirmed (see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580712-JWC-TC-01"><sic>34:36&#x2013;37</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1858-07-12">12 July 1858</date></corr></ref>); TC wrote to Louisa urging her to finalize the invitation (see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580711-TC-LBA-01"><sic>34:30&#x2013;31</sic><corr>TC to LBA, <date when="1858-07-11">11 July, 1858</date></corr></ref>), much to JWC&#x2019;s embarrassment (see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580712-TC-JWC-01"><sic>34:36</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-12">12 July 1858</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580721-JWC-TC-01"><sic>61</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1858-07-21">21 July 1858</date></corr></ref>).</note>&#x2014;&#x2014; No <hi rend="italic">time</hi> had been specified <hi rend="italic">then.</hi> So that when I received a letter on Monday (written in forgetfulness of the intervening Sunday) urging me to be at Chelford<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Charfield.</note> Station on Tuesday by four oclock, where Lady S would fetch the carriage for me; it quite took away my breath! I could not possibly get myself and the House packed by <hi rend="italic">Tuesday!</hi> Besides Lady Ashburton had offered to come to tea with me on Tuesday, and been accepted &#x201C;in my choicest mood&#x201C;&#x2014;so I answered that I would, D.V., be at Chelford Station by 4 on <hi rend="italic">Wednesday.</hi> A more tired Human Being than myself when I got into the train at Euston Square yesterday, you havent seen &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">this seven years</hi>&#x201D;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">1 Henry VI</hi> 4.3.</note> Geraldine and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin escorted me there, and paid me the last attentions! I was hardly out of sight of the Station when I fell back in my seat and&#x2014;went to sleep!!! and slept off and on (<hi rend="italic">me!</hi> in a railway carriage!) all the way to Crew; where I was roused into the usual wide awakeness by seeing the Van containing my portmanteau go off, as for <hi rend="italic">good!</hi> It came back however after much running and remonstrating. And I was put down at Chelford &#x201C;all right&#x201D; in a pouring rain, which indeed had poured without a moments intermission all day.</p>
<p>The carriage was waiting with drenched Coachman and footman, who, I had the discomfort of thinking must wish me at Jericho <hi rend="italic">at the least!</hi> And I was soon in the Hall at Alderley, into which Lady S, with the girls<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Maude as well as Katherine and Rosalind Stanley, the three unmarried and youngest das.</note> at her back, came running to welcome me with kisses and good words&#x2014; A much more <hi rend="italic">human</hi> mode of receiving visitors than I had been used to in Great Houses&#x2014;In fact the whole thing is very <hi rend="italic">human</hi> and very <hi rend="italic">humain</hi> as well.</p>

<salute>My dear Mary</salute>
<p>It went to my heart to have to answer such a dear kind letter as that of yours by proxy.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note></p>
<p>But I was really all but driven insane during my last days at Chelsea. Such a quantity of things laid on me to think of and to do, when <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was but partially recovered from serious illness, and my Doctor was every day urging on me the importance of keeping myself &#x201C;perfectly <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> and and above all avoiding every sort of fuss and worry&#x201D;! Fine Talking! as if one could <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> steer clear of fuss and worry in this world!</p>
<p>After months with no sleep &#x201C;to speak of&#x201C;&#x2014;and after living 24 hours on <pb id="pg-36-194" n="36:194"/>Brandy and water, and no food &#x201C;to speak of&#x201D; since; my views of Life, you see, aren&#x2019;t very comfortable!</p>
<p>But never mind all that just now!&#x2014;for I hope to see you face to face before many days are over!! And then I shall give myself the melancholy satisfaction of pouring all my recent troubles into your sympathetic breast and seeing you look very sorry for me!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell had been inviting me to pay her a visit ever since they went to their new house, <hi rend="italic">out of</hi> Thornhill; and I had not seen my way to any such self indulgence as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C always spoke of staying at home or near home this summer, in which case I should not have left him. Then, when I was left at home, with time to <hi rend="italic">listen</hi> to my own sufferings, which had been drowned in the eloquence of <hi rend="italic">his!</hi> I found myself on the verge of nervous fever, and my Doctor prohibited all <hi rend="italic">idea</hi> of travelling. till his &#x201C;composing draughts&#x201D; had &#x201C;taken effect on me&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The letter is written on two folded sheets that must at one time have been separated; TC wrote here: &#x201C;frag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> (<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>?) Alderley, connected with another?&#x201D;</note> The nervous illness being followed by another illness quite unconnected with it, an attack of British Cholera, I couldn&#x2019;t have &#x201C;carried out&#x201D; at all the idea of going to Dumfrieshire, which had been dawning in me; so that I had written to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell that <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> I would come; had not there come providentially a most kind invitation from Lady Stanley to spend a week at Alderley. which is <hi rend="italic">half</hi> way to Scotland<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alderley is ca. 115 mi. from London and ca. 296 mi. from Dumfries.</note> a distance that even my poor strength might manage. And at the same time came your dear little kind note making me feel more anxious to get to Dumfrieshire than I had yet been.</p>
<p>But as it was <hi rend="small-caps">now</hi> I found I must be at Alderley, or not at all; you may figure my hurry and agitation of mind&#x2014;so weak as I was and so much to prepare and arrange&#x2014;in leaving home at 2 days notice</p>
<p>Of all that however when we meet&#x2014;</p>
<p>I write today, with my head &#x201C;like a mall&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570904-JWC-TC-01"><sic>33:69</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1857-09-04">4 Sept. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> (from yesterdays shaking) to say that I mean to be with you next Tuesday or Wednesday (I shall write again to tell the positive day and hour) and to remain a day or two before I go on to Holme Hill</p>
<p>Even there I shall not be able to stay long&#x2014;for household reasons which I will explain by word of mouth</p>
<p>Dear Mary I was always made as comfortable as a Queen in your house. You are very wrong to make <hi rend="italic">apologies</hi> in asking me to it. There aren&#x2019;t so many houses in this world where such a welcome always meets one!&#x2014; Besides am I so difficult to make comfortable? I should say any one who had made M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C comfortable for months together needn&#x2019;t have any hesitation about asking <hi rend="italic">me.</hi></p>
<p><pb id="pg-36-195" n="36:195"/>I am not nearly so &#x201C;ill to deal wi&#x2019;&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret A.

<p>They are sending up to tell me to come out for a drive&#x2014;so excuse this hurried scrawl&#x2014;</p>
<p>Nothing can be kinder than my treatment here, I hope to be much fitter for the next half of the journey than I was for this.</p>
<p>I needn&#x2019;t ask you to give my bed a <hi rend="italic">terrible toasting</hi> if it hasn&#x2019;t been slept in <hi rend="italic">recently&#x2014;</hi>as I <hi rend="italic">do the impossible</hi> in catching cold when I change my room&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have got all your Letters; and am very glad to hear of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> continued well being in your Stirlingshire abode. Your weather seems to be no better than ours; and that is bad enough, continual damp and wind, seldom any effectual heavy rain, but a continual intermittent drizzle, with tempestuous blowings, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> perhaps are more sensible than elsewhere here in this treeless country. I have not suffered in health; and consider myself still to be making progress, at least not to be receding, in that import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> particul<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">progress</hi> in the &#x201C;book&#x201D; diriction<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> is unhappily a good deal stopped since the beginning of this week. I got <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with my Book 13 on monday, namely; and the remaining half of vol I<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC means vol. 1 of the next pair of vols. he expected to publish; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600716-TC-SGS-01">TC to <sic>Sir GS</sic><corr>SGS</corr>, <date when="1860-07-16">16 July</date></ref>.</note> (sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be quite a third I think) is in such a condition,&#x2014;being written 5 years ago, &#x26; not looked at since,&#x2014;that I know not well what to do with it; nor how to attack <hi rend="italic">it</hi> at all with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the aid of all my Books and Apparatus, and the day <hi rend="italic">altogether</hi> to myself. I sit boring over it, not idle quite, but with little <hi rend="italic">visible</hi> result; and that has considerably weakened the best strength of my position here. I dimly intended to hold on for &#x201C;about a month&#x201D;; and this is not unlikely to be the actual limit. Friday, tomorrow week, is a day I have been thinking of for departure and today I spoke of it to Sir G. who has always been or professed to be clear for &#x201C;2 months as the minimum&#x201C;: but will perhaps be at bottom not so averse after all to the shorter term,&#x2014;there being such a cackle <pb id="pg-36-196" n="36:196"/>of grandchildren here, with governesses &#x26;c, whom he sees to be to me a mere bore tho&#x2019; to him such a joy.</p>
<p>I mean to go, of course, with the Scrabster Steamer; but whether to Aberdeen, or to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is uncertain (a 3 days to Erskine at Linlathen being in my view); and in either case, I propose taking a glimpse of my poor Annandale again, and <hi rend="italic">returning</hi> thence by rail to Chelsea. I expected to have heard ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> from Jane what her plans are; but as she does not write, I have to shape at least to chalk, ready for potential shaping, my own plans at least</p>
<p>If you have any Travelling Oracle (awe-inspiring Bradshaw, Murray or the like) that will tell, even abstrusely, what one&#x2019;s true modes are for that route to Annandale,&#x2014;it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be useful to send me the approximate response. In this House nobody knows ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> such things: but in Thurso, I understand, there are who do.</p>
<p>Yesterday, by preappoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x201C;unless the day were wet&#x201D; (I not unwilling to have a day&#x2019;s idleness), we went to John O&#x2019; Groat&#x2019;s actual<hi rend="italic">ly:</hi> it is about 20 miles for us to the little sea-side inn of Huna; there you dismount, walk to Groat&#x2019;s (i.e. to the mythic site of Groat&#x2019;s) a short mile, thence two rather long ones to the top of Duncansby Head. It is one of the prettiest shores I ever saw: trim grass, or fine corn even, to the very brow of the sea; sand (when there is sand) as white as meal; and between sand and farm-field, a <hi rend="italic">glacis</hi> (or steep slope) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> also is covered with grass, in some places thick with meadow-sweet, &#x201C;queen-of-the-meadows,&#x201D; and quite odiferous as well as trim. The Island of Stroma<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Island in the Pentland Firth, 3&#xBD; mi. WNW of Duncansby Head.</note> flanks it, across a Sound of perhaps 2 miles broad; three ships were passing westward in our time, the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> wreck of a fourth was still traceable in fragm<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> sticking in the sand, or leant on <hi rend="italic">harrows</hi> higher up, by way of fence. The <hi rend="italic">site</hi> of Groat&#x2019;s has a Barn short way behind it, and a cottage short way to its left (looking seaward); the waves are ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a pistol-shot off at high water It stands (that is, a house <hi rend="italic">w</hi>d stand there) very beautifully, as at the bottom of a kind of <hi rend="italic">scoop,</hi> rising slowly behind into highish country, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> to west (tho&#x2019; not into <hi rend="italic">great</hi> heights at all), and the big Duncansby quite grandly screening it both from e. and n. e. And all was so admirably still &#x26; solitary; extensive Cheviot sheep nibbling all ab<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and no other living thing.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sheep had been brought from the Cheviot Hills in the Scottish Borders by Sir John Sinclair, Sir George&#x2019;s father, because they were hardy animals known for their high yield of mutton and wool. Early in the 19th century Caithness had taken in many of the people displaced by the Highland Clearances in Sutherland, but by mid-century Caithness landlords too were turning their tenantry out of their homes to make way for sheep; see also <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600924-TC-CAW-01">TC to CAW, <date when="1860-09-24">24 Sept.</date></ref></note> Like a dream. The Orkneys, Ronaldsha, Skerries<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >South Ronaldsay is the southernmost of the Orkney Islands; the Pentland Skerries are four tiny islands 4&#xBD; mi.

Groat&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">site</hi> appeared to me terribly like some extinct farmer&#x2019;s&#x2014;limekiln! Rain broke out on us coming home; and and I lost a good fraction of my sleep last night by the adventure. This is all I have to say of Groat or myself: high time I was in bed. <closer><salute>Ever yours</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>

<p><salute>Alas, my dear Goody,</salute> I fear you have been very poorly; and that there lay the too valid excuse for your not writing! I got Geraldine&#x2019;s Letter today; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was a great deal better than the nothing-at-all wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has been my diet in that kind lately. Her news is not the best in all parts; but nothing like so bad in any part as one&#x2019;s own sickly imaginat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> sometimes suggests.</p>
<p>I am delighted to think you have gone to Alderley, and are by all likelihood already there. Two hundred miles nearer me; tho&#x2019; still five hundred away. You c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have gone to any place that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have pleased me better. Lady S. is one of the warmest hearts, the young creatures too are cheery bright beings; everything is honest, rural, ample,&#x2014;a kind of cut-and-come-again, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> one can depend upon, in every depart<hi rend="italic">t.</hi> Cheshire is rainy; but perhaps may be <hi rend="italic">drier</hi> than its neighbours just now:&#x2014;in my life I have not seen so wet a year.&#x2014; Make my humble respects to Her Ladyship; and say, I am full of thankfulness to Destiny and Her that you are under Alderley rooftree;&#x2014;and that if she <hi rend="italic">can make you sleep</hi> to sufficient lengths I shall be infinitely obliged.</p>
<p>This week has gone well with me, in all points except the Friedrich-Book one (sorrow on it!) Work w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not go on at all in the new section: however, I took it in flank today, and did get some small way made again. A considerable comfort,&#x2014;in this the wettest of days. I have not stirred beyond the shrubbery (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has a high wall between you and the sea,&#x2014;pretty much the only shelter in the parish); I have wetted two pairs of trowsers (the last quite recently) walking there at diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> times,&#x2014;and have these drying beside me, with the <hi rend="italic">less wet</hi> of my Hats, at this very time.&#x2014;&#x2014; We have become a sad colony of children with governesses: fancy how delightful to me! Yet the people, Sir G. himself first of all, are unsurpassable in humanity and kindly honesty: they really are patience itself to my crabbed impatiences and me. I think of going off in about a week hence,&#x2014;there is only a conveyance <hi rend="italic">once</hi> a week (<hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> steamer to Aberdeen or Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>); Sir G. hospitably objects in a loud manner; <pb id="pg-36-198" n="36:198"/>but I think will be improved by consenting.

<salute>Dearest Mary!</salute>
<p>You must be thinking me a little insane, and you won&#x2019;t be far from the truth!</p>
<p>I have really been driven nearly beside myself by a complication of things&#x2014;a serious and most ill-timed illness included! My Dear! after one has gone for a week almost entirely without sleep, and almost entirely without other nourishment than Brandy and water (!!) one may be pardoned some ommissions!</p>
<p>Besides, till I had really got myself started, and found myself thus far alive, and life like I couldn&#x2019;t have answered your dear kind letter to any definite purpose. It depended altogether on how I stood the first half of the journey to Scotland, whether I undertook the other, or returned to Chelsea. where I should at least not trouble my friends with my ailments.</p>
<p>I came off so suddenly at the last, and had such a quantity of things to do in a hurry, with no strength to do them; that I did not get my Exodus announced to even my Husband!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle attached a long note here, defending TC in JWC&#x2019;s misunderstandings about his travel plans; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600825-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1860-08-25">25 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> And absurd as I felt it, after demanding an immediate answer from <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> to let my own next communication linger so long; I was obliged to just accept the absurdity! When you hear all my history of late weeks; you will not wonder that I should have failed in writing so much as that I should have failed in <hi rend="italic">dying</hi> or going <hi rend="italic">out of my mind.</hi></p>
<p>But to the purpose&#x2014;I am thus far safe, and tho&#x2019; the journey tired me excessively, I have been improving every hour since. Lady Stanley and her daughters are charming people, and as kind to me, and considerate, as it is possible to be.&#x2014; Last night I got the first <hi rend="italic">human</hi> sleep that I have had these six weeks! And I expect to be quite in heart for proceeding to <hi rend="italic">the Gill</hi> next week&#x2014;</p>
<p>Will you kindly address a line to me there!&#x2014;</p>

<p>I have to write to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, and my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last words to me were to &#x201C;beware of overworking that excited brain of mine,&#x201D; so I will leave all the rest till we meet.</p>

She was uneasy at having left this person in such a responsible position&#x201D; (A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:229).</note> I left in charge of my house is so inconceivably stupid, that I shouldn&#x2019;t wonder if she had mislaid, or forgotten to give you the addresses I left with her for your direction To make sure I now inclose them direct to yourself. <name>Jane Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I could sit down and take a good hearty <hi rend="italic">cry!</hi></p>
<p>I am not to get to you after all!</p>
<p>This morning is come a letter from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, forwarded from Chelsea, giving me the astounding news that there is every likelihood of his coming home by next Wednesdays Steamer!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC believed that TC intended sailing &#x201C;straight back, as he went&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600816-JWC-LST-01">JWC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LST</corr>, [ca. <date when="1860-08-16">16 Aug.</date>]</ref>. She thus misinterpreted <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600821-TC-JWC-01">TC&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1860-08-21">22 [21] Aug.</date></ref> in which he hinted that he might leave Thurso soon, &#x201C;my stay here cannot be long,&#x201D; as he needed the &#x201C;general reservoir of Books at Chelsea.&#x201D; Towards the end of the letter he wrote &#x201C;of <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi> shall I not hope to hear farther on coming home?&#x201D; and it is possible that JWC read his postal information, &#x201C;for Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> night means &#x2026; Saturday &#x2026; at Chelsea,&#x201D; as meaning he was leaving Wed. and would be home Sat. A. Carlyle claimed that the offending letter used the term &#x201C;sail South&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:229), a term that is not used in any of TC&#x2019;s letters about his plans, and that the letter arrived at Alderley, via Chelsea, on <date when="1860-08-25">25 Aug.</date> JWC later made clear that it was TC&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1860-08-21">22 [21] Aug.</date>, which she forwarded to Mary Austin, <date when="1860-08-25">25 Aug.</date>, &#x201C;as a valid excuse&#x201D; for &#x201C;breaking [her] engagement to come&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600902-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1860-09-02">2 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> Always the way! whenever I go anywhere to please myself!</p>
<p>Plump he appears at Chelsea! and just now his appearance there in my absence would be (as Lord Ashburton would say) &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Devil</hi>&#x201D;!</p>
<p>I cannot enter into an account of my household affairs just now&#x2014;being long and most ridiculous&#x2014; I was keeping it as an amusing story for you when we met&#x2014; I will write the story from Chelsea at my first <hi rend="italic">leisure</hi> (when will <hi rend="italic">that</hi> be?)&#x2014; But just now I am to<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> vexed for making a good story besides being too busy having so many letters demanding to be written about this provoking change of plan<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Stanley wrote to Lord Stanley, <date when="1860-08-26">26 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Poor Mrs. Carlyle who was going to Scotland Tuesday has heard from the Philosipher that he returns to Chelsea like a cannon ball &#x26; so she goes to meet him. She is very amusing &#x26; tells no end of stories&#x201D; (Nancy Mitford, <hi rend="italic">The Stanleys of Alderley</hi> [<date when="1939-00-00">1939</date>] 290).</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>When I leave here it must be straight for Chelsea! And I must go on Tuesday morning&#x2014; What a pity&#x2014;I was just beginning to recover my sleep in the fresh air and the absence of worries! have had actually two nights of good sleep&#x2014;and they are so kind to me and they to whom I was going would have been so kind to me!</p>
<p>But when one has married a man of genius one must take the consequences! <pb id="pg-36-201" n="36:201"/>Only there was no need for him to have spoken of staying at Thurso till the beginning of <date when="1860-10-00">October</date>! And misled me so!</p>

<p><salute>Oh my dear Mary!</salute> I am so very sorry! Instead of telling you the specific time of my arrival at the Gill, I have to tell you the unexpected and to me very disappointing news that I cannot get there at all!</p>
<p>A letter from M<hi rend="italic">r.</hi> C this morning has knocked all my scotch project on the head, remorselessly&#x2014;he is evidently coming back to Chelsea by the next Steamer!</p>
<p>And the house is by no means left in a state fit to receive him! And there is no servant there at present who can make the necessary preparations&#x2014;</p>
<p>My illness, and the complete failure of the new Servant<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Old Jane.&#x201D;</note> I had engaged having made it necessary even for myself, whose wants are much fewer to take back Charlotte<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Southam.</note> for days together.</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> I am right glad to hear of your safe arrival at hospitable Alderley: sound may you sleep there, may you have slept! I hope the rest of the Tour will run off as well as the somniferous ride to Crewe; what a beneficent railway, that, to receive a poor worn-down Goody, and wrap her gently in its iron clangours into immediate sleep!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wrote yesternight on getting Geraldine&#x2019;s message; but I could not completely recollect the Post-Town; and put &#x201C;Knutsford&#x201D; (the ancient <hi rend="italic">Ante-railway</hi> Post),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Before the mail was carried by rail, Knutsford was the nearest postal town to Alderley.</note> tho&#x2019; with a slight feeling that perhaps I was wrong. No saying but you may get <hi rend="italic">this</hi> before its antecessor: that is why I write half a word, in haste (after a long <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> walk), to keep your imaginat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> peaceable. I am well; tho&#x2019; my work today (if we can call it &#x201C;work&#x201D;) went rather wrong. The people here are kind as possible; and good Sir G. is certainly the hospitablest mortal living.</p>
<p>I had to settle my day of departure in <hi rend="italic">ignorance</hi> of your contemplated motions: Friday <hi rend="italic">next</hi> (31st); but that is not absolute,&#x2014;there is still pleadings, of respectable emphasis, for a lengthening of the term; or I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> linger elsewhere, and loiter:&#x2014;in short, you shall not be <hi rend="italic">hurried</hi> at Thornhill or elsewhere; only let me know what <hi rend="italic">your</hi> notion or guess of a notion is, that I may as far as feasible conform to it. There is a crew of noisy little jumping children here (5 or 4); whom I terrify by my grim manner, and thus drive mostly quite out of my way: but for this, my lodging might pretty much boast itself unparalleled for me. No hurry, no hurry, if you find you are getting benefit.</p>
<p>I shall have to write Notes tomorrow: Kirk &#x26;c I contrive always to eschew; but my walk in the weather of last sunday was unsuccessful. Hoy is beyond express<hi rend="italic">n</hi> beautiful, when we have a clear blink (as this ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) in the wet weather.

<dateline>Alderley Park &#x2F; Congleton <place>Cheshire</place> &#x2F; Saturday [<date when="1860-08-25">25 August 1860</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My dear William Dods&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I told you at our last interview<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William and Jane Dods visited Cheyne Row <date when="1860-08-08">8 Aug.</date>; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600810-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1860-08-10">[10] Aug.</date></ref></note> that I was the image of&#x2014;a flock of Turkeys! waiting, in the most weak minded manner, till a morsel of <hi rend="italic">red clout</hi> should beckon them in one particular direction!&#x2014; But perhaps my illustration was lost on you; thro&#x2019; your ignorance of Turkey habits. <hi rend="italic">Did</hi> you ever see a body of Turkeys&#x2014;or Geese&#x2014;on their travels along the Kings Highway? i never did in Scotland! The sight met my eyes for the first time in Piccadilly!!&#x2014;(<hi rend="italic">Geese</hi> it was in that instance&#x2014;but one wouldn&#x2019;t, you know, liken oneself to some hundreds of <hi rend="italic">Geese!</hi>) The creatures were getting over the ground by little sudden rushes, each rush being excited by a dust-coloured man a-head, shaking a pole, at the end of which fluttered a scarlet rag! That is the way that large bodies of Turkies or Geese are persuaded to go voluntarily long journeys in the South!</p>
<p>Well&#x2014;Shortly after you left, a rag <hi rend="italic">sufficiently red</hi> was fluttered before my uncertain mind, in the shape of a letter from that buxom sunshiny looking woman whom you saw a print of lying in my room! (Lady Stanley) pressing me to come to Alderley (in Cheshire). I liked the Place, and liked the People; then; it was just about half way between London and Dumfrieshire; so that when my visit ended, I could easily go on <hi rend="italic">there,</hi> where (I flattered myself) my coming was intensely wished for!</p>
<p>So to Alderley Park I came, and have been leading a delightfully quiet Life: things going on here in a most <hi rend="italic">human</hi> and simple manner, in the absence of the Lord of the Manor, who has been busied with his new Postoffice-Generalship in London. I was to have gone on to Annandale next Wednesday, and was quite in heart for the journey; having improved every day here;&#x2014;felt to be <hi rend="italic">growing a new skin</hi> over my nervous system! Sleep having returned to me and my nights no longer such as beseemed a woman who had committed murder, or other capital crime or crimes&#x2014;of which upon my word I am quite innocent!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But, alas for &#x201C;best laid schemes of mice and men&#x201D;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Robert Burns, &#x201C;To a Mouse&#x201D; line 39.</note> Yesterday<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC told both Mary Russell [<date when="1860-08-25">25 Aug.</date>] and Mary Austin [<date when="1860-08-25">25 Aug.</date>] that TC&#x2019;s letter arrived &#x201C;this morning.&#x201D;</note> came a letter from my Husband, whom I was fondly imagining fixed at Thurso Castle till the beginning of <date when="1860-10-00">October</date>; telling me he could not get on with his work at a distance from his reservoir of Books;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC used this phrase in <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600821-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-08-21">22 [21] Aug.</date></ref>, but did not mention possibly going home &#x201C;next week.&#x201D; He was no more specific than &#x201C;[i]n the negative case, my stay here cannot be long.&#x201D;</note> and might possibly be home next week!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-36-204" n="36:204"/>Home!&#x2014;and the curtains of his bed at the Dyer&#x2019;s!&#x2014;and all the spoons and silver things hidden away from <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> thieves, where only myself could find them!&#x2014;and all the Keys locked up in&#x2014;the Piano!&#x2014;unlabelled! no body to <hi rend="italic">do for</hi> him but an old Cook of 71 whom every thing like an emergence reduces to absolute idiocy!&#x2014; And <hi rend="italic">he</hi> the most &#x201C;particular&#x201D; and most impatient of Men! and I the most self-bothering and excitable of Women!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Alas for my <hi rend="italic">programme</hi> of visits in Dumfrieshire!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">That</hi> is now knocked on the head! And I see no help for it but to go my ways back to Cheyne Row, and resume my sleepless nights, and oppressive days. and &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">die at my post</hi>&#x2019;! (as the dramatic phrase is!)&#x2014; Not that I have any positive intention of dying in that Martyr fashion&#x2014;or in any fashion I can help&#x2014;before you and your Wife have come to London again and made amends for the stinted measure of kindness you bestowed on me&#x2014; Especially <hi rend="italic">she&#x2014;</hi>for <hi rend="italic">you did</hi> put yourself to the trouble of coming a second time&#x2014; And that is why you have here a letter &#x201C;all to yourself&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >5.

<p>I shall go home, D V, (you know there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Ds!) on Tuesday next&#x2014;to make ready for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, in case he come by this weeks steamer&#x2014;</p>
<p>I want very much to hear who has bought my poor dear Sunny Bank?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The sale by auction, <date when="1860-08-07">7 Aug.</date>, was advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman,</hi> <date when="1860-07-25">25 July</date>: &#x201C;THE HOUSE OF SUNNYBANK OR <hi rend="small-caps">tenterfield</hi>, with the <hi rend="small-caps">Coach-house, Stable</hi>, and other <hi rend="small-caps">Offices</hi>, and <hi rend="small-caps">Gardens</hi> and <hi rend="small-caps">Fields</hi> attached, extending in all to about 5&#xBD; Acres imperial measure, &#x2026; lying in the immediate vicinity of the town of Haddington. &#x2F; This is a very eligible Property, the present House, with the Pleasure-Grounds, being a most agreeable residence, and the adjoining Fields offering very desirable Sites for additional Villas. &#x2F; Further particulars will be furnished by <hi rend="small-caps">John Ferme</hi>, Writer, Haddington, who is in possession of the Titles.&#x201D; William Dods replied to JWC, <date when="1860-08-29">29 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Sunnybank was sold to Mr Thomas Todrick &#x2026; 3 small fields and a Garden near the coach road were sold in one lot for &#xa3;2200&#x2014;which is &#xa3;300 below my value. &#x2F; Mr T. intends making considerable additions &#x26; alterations &#x26; may lay out perhaps &#xa3;800 or &#xa3;1000 in these which will raise the price to him. That vain fellow Stuart Donaldson had never intended buying it although he said he would. &#x2026; Next comes the sale of the furniture. &#x2026; There is an engraving of your Husband which I will buy &#x26; if there are any of your own Photographs exposed for sale I will take care of them also. I suppose there is no little article about the House that you would care to possess if there is let me know. &#x2F; What about the Shawl &#x26; Brooch that were intended for you? It is real dishonesty in the Donaldsons&#x2019; keeping these but you should ask for them &#x26; tell them that you understand from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Dods &#x2026; that these were laid aside to be sent you.&#x201D; Thomas Todrick (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890-00-00">90</date>), banker.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Oh dear me!</salute> this length of days needed for a letter written to or from Thurso to get an answer in the course of post is very trying to impatient spirits!&#x2014; Not on account of the slowness only&#x2014;but on account of the &#x2018;change come o&#x2019;er the spirit of ones dream&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Byron, &#x201C;The Dream.&#x201D;</note> in the interval between the Post going out and coming in!&#x2014; Not once since you have been at that accursedly out of the way place, has a letter from you found me in the same mood and circumstances to which it was addressed&#x2014;as being the mood and circumstances in which my own letter had left me! And of course it has been the same with my letters to you. For example; your announcement that you might be home immediately crossing my announcement that I was on the road to Scotland!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Now</hi> I write to say I am <hi rend="italic">turning back,</hi> and shall be at Chelsea D. V. on Tuesday afternoon, to prepare for you&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">in case</hi> you do come soon&#x2014;which I shall regret for <hi rend="italic">your</hi> sake; a few more weeks of sound sleep would be so good for you! What will be the contents of the letter which crosses this? Something quite irrelevent I have no doubt!</p>
<p>Perhaps assurances that you can do perfectly well at Chelsea without me, and to stay in Scotland as long as I like!&#x2014; When I shall be <hi rend="italic">reading the letter</hi> at <pb id="pg-36-206" n="36:206"/>Cheyne Row!&#x2014; And as sure as ever Woman was of anything that you could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have done at Chelsea without me for twelve hours!</p>
<p>The week before my departure which should have been devoted to setting my house in order was devoted to British Cholera, which coming on the back of low nervous fever reduced me to a state of exhaustion which even &#x201C;zeal for my house&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 69:9.</note> couldn&#x2019;t rouse to the requisite activity&#x2014; Many things had been begun but few of them finished, for instance your bed had been all taken to pieces to look for bugs&#x2014;and it had been ascertained that <hi rend="italic">not one bug survived there!</hi> and the bed had been put together; <hi rend="italic">but</hi> the curtains were away being cleaned!</p>
<p>Fancy your coming home to a curtainless bed! And &#x201C;old Jane&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I have quite forgotten&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:45).</note> would have made no shift! for &#x201C;old Jane&#x201D; my Dear, I may as well tell you soon as syne is a complete failure and humbug! Altho you provokingly enough attributed the silence I systematically observe on the shortcomings of servants to want of &#x201C;care about it,&#x201D; I still think that until I am arrived at parting with a servant and have to show reason why, the more I hold my peace about them and make the best of them, the more for <hi rend="italic">your</hi> comfort and for my own credit.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Alas! can that need to be said?&#x2014;insane that I was!&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:45).</note></p>
<p>&#x201C;Old Jane,&#x201D; then, disappointed me from the first day! Before you left I had satisfied myself that she was a perfectly incompetent <hi rend="italic">cook</hi> and servant, and soon after you left, I satisfied myself that she&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">told lies!</hi> and had no more sense of honour in her work than Charlotte!!!&#x2014; There was no need to worry you with the topic of her which was to myself perfectly loathsome&#x2014;until I had to account for replacing her. I mention it now to reconcile you to the idea of my having gone back home to wait for you&#x2014; You <hi rend="italic">couldnt</hi> have done without me&#x2014; You see!&#x2014; I have engaged a woman of 34<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Tall Charlotte.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;who is really promising&#x2014;(the woman Miss Evans<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot).</note> wanted to have)&#x2014;and a remarkably nice looking girl of 16<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah. &#x201C;Yes, I recollect these two. I had often latterly been urging &#x2018;two servants,&#x2019; but she never till now would comply. The <hi rend="italic">elder</hi> of these &#x2018;two&#x2019; did not suit either. A conceited fool; got the name &#x2018;Perfection&#x2019; and (to the great joy of the younger, who continued worthily) had to go in a few months&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:46).</note> to be under her&#x2014; She would not have taken a place of &#x201C;all work,&#x201D; and indeed it is very difficult to find ever a respectable Servant who <hi rend="italic">will</hi> take it&#x2014;Naturally&#x2014;when they can find plenty of less confused places&#x2014;She the elder woman comes home on the <date when="1860-09-14">14 of Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>&#x2014;and I wished the Girl to wait till then&#x2014; I think the house will really be comfortable and orderly by and by&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">at more cost</hi> but that you said repeatedly you didnt mind&#x2014; At all rates I have taken immense trouble (two journeys to Richmond <pb id="pg-36-207" n="36:207"/>included) to find respectable and competent servants&#x2014; If I have failed&#x2014;it will just be another instance of my ill luck rather than my want of zeal</p>
<p>Maud<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maude Stanley.</note> has been sitting in my room waiting till I am done&#x2014;</p>
<p>Excuse haste and abrupt ending&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t write on this principle&#x2014;and I shant get a chance again before post time</p>

I have a weakness for high beds! which are all associated in my mind with the Bed of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Sleeping Beauty,</hi>&#x201D; as represented by a wood-cut in my first Story-Book! From this Alderley High Bed one could see, when the shutters were opened, away over a beautifully wooded Park, all green as emeralds! And the silence!&#x2014;so deep!&#x2014; It seemed a <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> thing, a thing to be taken hold of! like a mantle of down fallen on one out of Heaven! I thought of the masons roofing and flooring at Chelsea&#x2014;of the <hi rend="italic">cocks</hi> crowing at Brighton&#x2014;of all the noises that had embittered existence for us in past times, and thanked God and Lady Stanley that I was here&#x2014;in such stillness and freshness and greenness! For two days and two nights every hour seemed to bring healing on its wings.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Mal. 4:2 and Charles Wesley, &#x201C;Hark the Herald Angels Sing&#x201D; (<date when="1739-00-00">1739</date>).</note> Nothing to vex or worry me! But life made beautiful and pleasant for me&#x2014;in every possible way! I felt to be growing <hi rend="italic">a new skin</hi> over my <hi rend="italic">flayed</hi> nervous system, and looked forward to the other half of my journey, and my Scotch visits, with a feeling of hope and pleasure which was far from me when I started on the first half.&#x2014; But alas for &#x201C;best laid schemes of mice and men&#x201D;!&#x2014; On Saturday morning a letter was forwarded from Chelsea, which had arrived from Thurso Castle; in which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C informed me that he was &#x201C;approaching a crisis&#x201D; <pb id="pg-36-208" n="36:208"/>in his affairs! didn&#x2019;t see his way thro&#x2019; the next Chapters of his Book&#x2014;without help from his reservoir of books at Home! was besides threatened with &#x201C;an influx of new Grandchildren&#x201D; (not his own; Sir George&#x2019;s!)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600821-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-08-21">22 [21] Aug.</date></ref></note> In short it was &#x201C;becoming clear&#x201D; to him that he could not (say <hi rend="italic">would</hi> not) remain at Thurso much longer &#x201C;indeed that he might be expected at Chelsea almost immediately&#x201D;!!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >These words were not in <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600821-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-08-21">22 [21] Aug.</date></ref> TC implied he would write again &#x201C;Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> night&#x201D; and did, <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600822-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-08-22">23 [22] Aug.</date></ref>, where these words also did not appear.

<p>I have seldom in my life been so vexed by anything of that kind as by the news you sent me this afternoon. My Unfortunate, dear, infatuated Goody! If you have actually gone back to Chelsea, and are sitting there this night instead of at The Gill, and all on a basis of mere mistake &#x26; delusion, I know not how I shall ever endure it. Your hypothesis is baseless from beginning to <pb id="pg-36-209" n="36:209"/>end; and if you have <hi rend="italic">missed</hi> gaining a little strength, will not that be a kindness to me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Not being able to pick a Letter from you (what was more y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> misfortune, poor soul, than y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> crime) I was obliged to do the best I could in making some approximate arrang<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for my separate self: I spoke of Friday 31st here as my day of departure hence;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><ref target="volume-36/lt-18600824-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1860-08-24">24 [23] Aug.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600824-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-08-24">24 Aug.</date></ref></note>&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was by no means fixed (and is now, on the new phenomena turning up, <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> another way,&#x2014;viz. to be the <hi rend="italic">following</hi> Friday, Friday <date when="1860-09-07">7 Sept<hi rend="italic">r!</hi></date>)&#x2014; But neither then nor now was it [ever]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word illegible.</note> in my head to run directly upon Chelsea; I did not and do not count on that for 2 weeks or 3 <hi rend="italic">more.</hi> See what a mess!</p>
<p>I could not bear to read the <hi rend="italic">burble</hi> you had put on record, or at least to <hi rend="italic">sit</hi> after reading it; so I walked out with long strides along the shore: <hi rend="italic">there</hi> the happy notion took me that, on getting my <hi rend="italic">2d</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Congleton</hi> Letter (yesterday),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600825-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-08-25">25 Aug.</date></ref>, the first letter that TC sent directly to Congleton; <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600824-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-08-24">24 Aug.</date></ref>, was addressed to Knutsford and arrived the same day as the former letter.</note> you would see the real state of my program, and instantly give up your mad Chelsea speculation,&#x2014;and perhaps may be sitting at The Gill this night, after all, instead? Pray Heaven it be so: if you have done <hi rend="italic">so,</hi> I will forgive you every thing. The tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that you are run back to Chelsea is like to drive me furious! If you are <hi rend="italic">there,</hi> the thing I should wish you of all things to do, is to get into the Liverpool railway or the Manchester (dividing your journey in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> way), and to go and do y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Nithsdale journey <hi rend="italic">yet.</hi> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> in very deed. Out upon it, I never met with such a thing!</p>
<p>As to &#x201C;old Jane,&#x201D; I confess myself completely glad you have parted with her. No part of her own or her work&#x2019;s physiognomy ever pleased me in reality at all. It is far, far better to try the thing on the commonly rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> principles: I expect confidently y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Two Servants will do <hi rend="italic">better,</hi> &#x26; be nicely worth and again worth their addit<hi rend="italic">l</hi> cost. <hi rend="italic">Are</hi> you at The Gill; are you at Chelsea (Heaven forbid)! You see I aim at the <hi rend="italic">middle point.</hi> Write at once. God bless, poor Goody I am well, doing well enough; only my <hi rend="italic">work</hi> falling considerably towards abeyance, in spite of me.&#x2014; <name>T.C</name></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Notes; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have got all in due succession, keeping me informed of your motions,&#x2014;the last of the series this day. Our mail was <pb id="pg-36-210" n="36:210"/><hi rend="italic">delayed</hi> 2 or 3 hours this day: &#x201C;some accident at Carlisle,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> reported, <date when="1860-08-29">29 Aug.</date>, a &#x201C;Fatal Collision on the Caledonian Railway&#x201D; near Beattock, 14 mi. N of Lockerbie. One driver was &#x201C;killed on the spot&#x201D; and a fireman seriously injured.</note> the rumour said? I try to believe this does not concern <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> at the same time, I had rather not have heard of it.</p>
<p>Your voyaging directions are perfectly precise and effectual;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1860-08-27">27 [Aug.]</date>, giving TC comprehensive train times between Aberdeen, Dundee, and Edinburgh, and from Aberdeen to Beattock or Lockerbie, and thence to Ecclefechan.</note> I lay them carefully by, ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the day of departure. Friday <date when="1860-09-07"><hi rend="italic">7 Sept</hi>r</date> is finally the fixed period,&#x2014;that is, a <hi rend="italic">week</hi> later, the good people here having pressed for a fortnight. I mean to keep that day. Aberdeen and rail<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Steamer to Aberdeen, then rail.</note> is clearly the method: I shall probably make but short stay with Erskine;&#x2014;it is possible even I may push on towards Annandale at once; tho&#x2019; indeed I ought not; and &#x201C;some 3 days&#x201D; are the term I am vaguely counting on.</p>
<p>Jane&#x2019;s move<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> are a provoking enigma to me; her want of punctuality in <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> has perceptibly aggravated all my other uneasinesses on that head. Misinterpreting altogether some Letter she got of mine at Alderley, she writes me, Sunday last, that she will <hi rend="italic">turn back</hi> on Tuesday (that everything may be ready for my home-coming); and so <hi rend="italic">was</hi> to be in Chelsea again, on Tuesday Ev<hi rend="italic">g!</hi> I am in hopes that a second Letter she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get next day at Alderley w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> clear up her doubts, and send her on to Annandale as originally settled. Most vexatious other wise! But irremediable, however it may have gone. Today again, in these circumstances, she sends no Letter, and leaves me to my doubts,&#x2014;till it fairly <hi rend="italic">strike</hi> her (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it seems seldom fairly to do) that there are inexorably <hi rend="italic">five days</hi> bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> quest<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in our actual position! She is evidently in a very weak way too: I wish and hope she may have come on!</p>
<p>I continue to <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> perfectly here, to bathe, to &#x26;c, and am lodged as well as I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be in the world. Work, however, is often sadly in abeyance,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I never quite give up, but hang by it for my appointed 4 hours.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John wrote: &#x201C;I should be disposed to give up work for a time, in your place, as the materials for it are not within reach.&#x201D;</note> There was, yesterday, <hi rend="italic">another</hi> exped<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to John o&#x2019;Groat&#x2019;s, but that I contrived to evade. We have had 1 entirely bright and dry day; ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 3 others partially so; the rest, rain, rain &#x26; wind. Goodish crops, but nothing yet cut, or quite ready.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> reported, <date when="1860-08-25">25 Aug.</date>, that in Caithness and Sutherland the &#x201C;heavy rains and gales of last week have laid the corn in some places, but on the whole the country looks well. The harvest will be undoubtedly late. &#x2026; In Caithness there will be no general harvest before the <date when="1860-09-15">middle of September</date>, or near the latter end of it.&#x201D; John also reported the state of Jamie&#x2019;s crops as &#x201C;very far back.&#x201D;</note> <closer><salute>My affectionate regards to Jamie &#x26; the others all.

<p><salute>Dear Neuberg,&#x2014;</salute>Ever since the Saturday after you last saw me, I have been stationary here; doing well, especially in the article of <hi rend="italic">sleeping;</hi> writing also daily a little,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; that, now that Book XIII is about over, does not go so well as it used to do, or sometimes go at all, my resources in the Book way being so exiguous here. Of course I have often enough tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of you; but there was never anything so definite as to be worth a formal Summons. Nor is there yet; our distance, almost at nearest, being <hi rend="italic">five days</hi> from one another;&#x2014;however, I do mold a paper list that has been accumulating, and write a word. I said our distance was ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 5 days: Thus, if you write on Monday afternoon from London, I get it here <hi rend="italic">Wedn</hi>y afternoon; I ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> that night, or next morning before 10 (all the same), you get it Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> morning, not sooner! If I write <hi rend="italic">hence</hi> on Monday morning, and you ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> delay, the circuit might be complete on Friday 3 p. m.&#x2014;that is the utmost. We <hi rend="italic">get</hi> a post on Sunday; but it is not delivered till next morning.</p>
<p>Today, after tusselling ab<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> for almost 2 weeks past, <hi rend="italic">with</hi>t brill<hi rend="italic">t</hi> effect, on that 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Silesian War <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you know so well, I pushed it aside, and began some attempt in &#x201C;Vol IV,&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;10 years of Peace,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Book 16, pbd. in vol. 4 of the first edn. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:194&#x2013;410).</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> must all go into one Book,&#x2014;of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the more one reads of it in discontinuous Preuss and the like of him, the <hi rend="italic">less</hi> impress<hi rend="italic">n</hi> one has. That now seems the stumbling block in chief. I have (in hoping moments!) a notion to resume <hi rend="italic">printing,</hi> directly on my return. I am clearly in improved circumst<hi rend="italic">ces,</hi> as to <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> &#x26;c, but very weak,&#x2014;and grow seemingly weaker and lazier, the more I sleep. Friday <date when="1860-09-07">Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 7</date>, I have settled to unanchor, and move gradually south<hi rend="italic">d</hi> again. My wife was (and I still hope, is!) to meet me in Dumfriesshire: but, bewildered in the <hi rend="italic">tedious post,</hi> and chiefly in her own wilful neglect to <hi rend="italic">consider</hi> that inexorable fact, she has (I dreadfully apprehend) turned back in Cheshire, and sat down in Chelsea again, under the supposition that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was just rushing home. Nobody has more need of the Country than she. This (if it <hi rend="italic">have</hi> taken place) will be a great sorrow to me;&#x2014;and I wish she c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be persuaded to start <hi rend="italic">again</hi> (if <hi rend="italic">able</hi> at all, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she does not clearly inform me ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>), and rectify her huge error.</p>
<p>This is a curious remote Country, 700 miles away from you; with the <hi rend="italic">Orkneys</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Seal</hi>-Islands),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Orkney&#x201D; comes from the Old Norse word for &#x201C;Seal Islands.&#x201D;</note> in a precipitous picturesque manner, looking over; <pb id="pg-36-212" n="36:212"/>on one, at a distance of few miles. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Thor&#x2019;s-Oe</hi>&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Thurso&#x201D; means Thor&#x2019;s River in Old Norse.</note> a wholly Norse Populat<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> tho&#x2019; in the Western parts, fractions of them still speak <hi rend="italic">Gaelic.</hi> Taught by St Colm,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the St. Colm who, with St. Drostan and St. Fergus, established a mission in NE Aberdeenshire at the beginning of the sixth century to convert the Picts, rather than St. Columba (ca. <date when="0521-00-00">521</date>&#x2013;<date when="0597-00-00">97</date>), also called St. Colm, who left Ireland for Scotland in <date when="0563-00-00">563</date> and founded the church and monastery on the island of Iona in the Inner Hebrides, W of the Scottish mainland.</note> I do believe, and his Priest Missionaries; for the Scotch Highlands are essentially <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Norse, with a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> admixture in the most Celtic regions.

<p>Well, you have again been and done it, you unfortunate Goody! All yesterday I lived in the comfortable hope that my second letter had dispelled your delusion, and that you were on to Annandale,&#x2014;no scrape of a pen was allowed me, I had to make the best of my doubts. But here is the fact itself; undeniably you are back to Chelsea; and my lamenting will do no good at all. In the course of this Journey there has nothing happened nearly so unpleasant to me. Indeed it has been a very great aggravation to all my uneasinesses this obstinate refusal of yours to write to me with promptitude, punctuality, and in clear recognition of the inexorable fact that a Note and Answer took at the very shortest 5 days,&#x2014;and if the Note was from <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> six. However, we cannot now help it; and the confusion on that score, having done its worst, is about over.&#x2014; My new idea is, that your own poor heart failed you at Alderley, glad of any shadow of excuse; and that you must be quite exeedingly weak and ill! Judge what a pretty &#x201C;compan<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of my solitude&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Tobias Smollett, <hi rend="italic">Adventures of Roderick Random</hi> (<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>) (chap. 64).</note> this is:&#x2014;if I get no Letter tomorrow either (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is very possible) things will have a smiling look!&#x2014; Is it quite impossible to persuade you still to risk some other <hi rend="italic">try</hi> for a <pb id="pg-36-213" n="36:213"/>little Country, for a little strength?

<p>Rain, rain: Tuesday was &#x201C;fine&#x201D; here too; the two days since (till ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 2 p. m. each) have been rainier than ever.&#x2014; Children noisy and rather disagreeable; work more than <hi rend="italic">half</hi> impossible (owing to want of Books); affair generally good, honest, salutary, &#x201C;tho&#x2019; of prosy bory nature&#x201D;!

<p><salute>After all, you know, dearest Lady Stanley,</salute> I would have gone to Alderley when you asked me, all the same, had the idea of going on to Scotland never suggested itself! and it was not till after I had got some &#x201C;human sleep&#x201D; at <pb id="pg-36-214" n="36:214"/>Alderley, that the idea took a practical shape, and I wrote to say that I was coming! So&#x2014;in point of <hi rend="italic">fact,</hi> there is no sense in my regarding myself as a victim&#x2014;to either the unconscious perversity of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, or the perversity of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s sworn friends &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">The Destinies</hi>&#x2019; alias &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Superior Powers</hi>&#x201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590603-JWC-IEB-01"><sic>35:102</sic><corr>JWC to IEB, <date when="1859-06-03">3 June 1859</date></corr></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:375.</note> If I am a <hi rend="italic">victim</hi> at all in the present case, it is to my own idiotic credulity in having believed the testimony of a female Novelist<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine Jewsbury.</note> on <hi rend="italic">any</hi> practical matter! and taken an Imbecile of 71<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Old Jane.&#x201D;</note> to <hi rend="italic">do for</hi> us!&#x2014;the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">us</hi>&#x2019; including a <hi rend="italic">Man of Genius,</hi> who would require a <hi rend="italic">Servant of Genius</hi> to understand what he wants and means!&#x2014; Left to the cares of such an incompetent old Creature, what <hi rend="italic">could</hi> He have done but&#x2014;strangled her! and then committed suicide! Oh, depend on it, by returning post haste, I have prevented something dreadful!</p>
<p>Well for me if I can take from that reflection all the consolation I need! I feel so very like a bird that had cleared the garden wall with a string to its leg, and, just when making for open space, had been twitched back with a sudden jerk!&#x2014; The sensation is &#x201C;rather exquisite&#x201D;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see William Godwin, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Author of a Vindication of the Rights of Woman</hi> (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>) 164; see also <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310817-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:337&#x2013;38</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-17">17 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430615-JWC-JW-01"><sic>16:198</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1843-06-15">15 June 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; But listening to one&#x2019;s sensations is the most <hi rend="italic">spoonyish,</hi> most profitless occupation that human creatures have yet invented for themselves!

Which has been done, none the worse for my having done it to a running accompaniment of thoughts of Alderley,&#x2014;its greenness, and freshness, and stillness, and adorable kindness; its &#x201C;bright young Beings,&#x201D; its three white dogs!&#x2014; I won&#x2019;t forget all that, or any of it in a hurry! It was such a change from the life of worry and suffocation and sleeplessness, I had left! Like being folded all round body and soul in magic Eider down,&#x2014;for a space of six days!</p>
<p>My journey was beyond expectation fortunate! A carriage to myself the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> way! and a Guard who payed me &#x201C;delicate attentions,&#x201D; even brought my portmanteau to my feet&#x2014;before I had time to ask for it!

<p>The individual who took most notice of the bird,&#x2014;noticed indeed nothing else from the moment she appeared, was the family Cat! so practical as well as passionate seemed Pussy&#x2019;s interest in the new-comer; that even before taking off my bonnet, or looking what letters were on the table, I had to carry my new &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Chimera</hi>&#x201D; up stairs, and lock her in <hi rend="italic">the</hi> spare room, and put the key in my pocket!&#x2014;and all tea time I was deeply meditating&#x2014;not on my Husband&#x2019;s return&#x2014;not on &#x201C;the duty nearest hand&#x201C;&#x2014;but&#x2014;on how that little Bird was to be <hi rend="italic">got out</hi> of that wicker cage! nay, on how it was ever got into it!

How? the devil got the apple in?&#x2019;&#x201D; (Peter Pindar, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> [<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>] 1:95).</note> The Chimera&#x2019;s young mistress had given me no clue to the <hi rend="italic">solution!</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kate Stanley wrote, <date when="1860-09-03">3 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;I was so amused at y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> not being able to find the opening of the cage I am so accustomed to those sort that I never thought of showing you the secret but as the bird was none the worse it only gave you a few minutes puzzle.&#x201D;</note> and it was by my own unassisted Genius that I hit on it at last.</p>
<p>Nobody has called yet for the little packet Miss Stanley<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maude Stanley. The packet was for Mary Ann Hunt, not further identified, who was staying at the Stanleys&#x2019; London home, 40 Dover St., Piccadilly W; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600905-JWC-KST-01">JWC to <sic>KS</sic><corr>KST</corr>, [<date when="1860-09-05">5 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> entrusted me with. If it be still here, the first day I go out; I will take it myself to Dover Street. Hitherto I have not crossed the threshold; hating the appearance of things outside! after beautiful Alderley! and exercise enough cut out for me in running up and down my own stairs.</p>
<p>Not a line from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C since I came home! so I am still in perfect uncertainty whether he is coming straight home or round by Dumfrieshire! I leave this letter open till after tomorrow&#x2019;s post&#x2014;when please Heaven I shall have news!</p>
<p>Friday [<date when="1860-08-31">31 Aug. 1860</date>]</p>
<p>Yes! I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> news this morning but not from <hi rend="italic">Himself.</hi> The letter forwarded from Alderley was a letter from Sir George who, &#x201C;his dear friend&#x2019;s pen being devoted to the Service of unborn generations&#x201D; (Oh the Devil fly away with the &#x201C;unborn generations&#x201D;!) wrote to tell me the dear Friend &#x201C;had been prevailed on to prolong his stay until Friday the 7<hi rend="italic">th</hi>!&#x201C;&#x2014; Which made me very mad&#x2014;not the prolonging of the stay&#x2014;for the longer he stays the better for <pb id="pg-36-216" n="36:216"/>himself; <hi rend="italic">ergo&#x2014;</hi>the better for me! but very mad at his &#x201C;devoting his pen,&#x201D; under the circumstances to &#x201C;unborn,&#x201D; or born, &#x201C;Generations,&#x201D; rather than to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> his dutiful, long suffering Wife! Very mad indeed! until I suddenly bethought me, that at the time Sir G&#x2019;s letter was written, and his dear friend&#x2019;s change of purpose took place; the letter, written at Alderley, to say I was going straight home, couldn&#x2019;t have reached Thurso Castle!</p>
<p>So now I think I shall no longer turn a deaf ear to the voice of a Charmer<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 58:5.</note> who was advising me to come to&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Margate!</hi><note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Neuberg had proposed that JWC accompany him to the seaside resort in Kent; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600903-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1860-09-03">3 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> of all places! from Saturday till Monday It is so dull and lonely here! Nothing but work, work, work to keep one from Blue Devil, and alas! no <hi rend="italic">strength,</hi> for the moment, to work with!</p>
<p>God bless you dear Lady! I think of your kind soft treatment of me, with no end of gratitude!&#x2014; I was never happier on a visit in my life!&#x2014; At least not since I was &#x201C;a bright young Being,&#x201D; with a quite other faculty for happiness than I have now!</p>

Then, the letter forwarded to Alderley from Chelsea, written in the belief I was still at home, made no allusion whatever to any intention of taking Dumfrieshire on your road home. You could not remain there longer without work, and to get on with your work you must be &#x201C;beside your reservoir of books at Chelsea.&#x201D; Read that letter yourself&#x2014;Mary Austin has got it (I sent it to her as my valid excuse for breaking my engagement to come&#x2014;and as a valid excuse <hi rend="italic">she</hi> <pb id="pg-36-218" n="36:218"/>accepted it)<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s letter mentioning his probable need for &#x201C;the general reservoir of Books at Chelsea,&#x201D; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600821-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-08-21">22 [21] Aug.</date></ref>; JWC forwarded it to Mary Austin, <date when="1860-08-25">25 Aug.</date></note> and say if I was committing any &#x201C;huge error&#x201C;&#x2014;or error at all in supposing it in the higest<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> degree probable that you would sail straight from Thurso to London? And granting that high probability&#x2014;there was but one course for me under the circumstances (the <hi rend="italic">curtains,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">keys</hi> which you could never have known, one from another! the imbecile &#x201C;Old Jane,&#x201D; the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Servant to come &#x26;c &#x26;c) but one course&#x2014;to go <hi rend="italic">South</hi> again instead of <hi rend="italic">north</hi> on the day when my Alderley visit was to terminate. <hi rend="italic">Unless&#x2014;</hi>after my resolution was taken, and every body warned <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to expect me in Dshire&#x2014;and the new woman who had been put off,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had wanted Sarah to start <date when="1860-09-14">14 Sept.</date>; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600826-TC-JWC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1860-08-26">26 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> warned that she must now <hi rend="italic">immediately render</hi> herself at Cheyne Row&#x2014;unless after all that, I was to unsettle everything over again, at the <hi rend="italic">very last hour,</hi> when there was no longer time to warn anybody&#x2014;on the receipt of the two little letters which came together, (taking <hi rend="italic">them</hi> as an exposition of your <hi rend="italic">voluntary</hi> plans, not of plans which you had been <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> to adopt <hi rend="italic">voluntarily</hi> by the knowledge of mine&#x2014;by the dread of going home to a comfortless house, and, simultaneously with that, a kind desire not to interfere with any arrangements of mine by which my health might be benefitted. No! I could not be quite certain that were I at Chelsea instead of half way to Scotland you might not <hi rend="italic">still wish</hi> to avoid &#x201C;the horror of Railways,&#x201D; and to get back to your &#x201C;reservoir of Books&#x201C;&#x2014; At all events you should have your <hi rend="italic">free</hi> choice&#x2014; And now you have had it, and I learn <hi rend="italic">thro M</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Neuberg</hi> that it is; to be &#x201C;in no hurry.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I am very glad of that, as I shall be in better trim for you here, than had you come straight. as to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> &#x201C;starting again&#x201D; (on any long expedition at least) you couldnt believe <hi rend="italic">Mr Neuberg</hi> or any one else could persuade me to it! I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x201C;able at all&#x201C;&#x2014;which does not mean however that I am <hi rend="italic">ill.</hi> My three days at Alderley <hi rend="italic">before the letter came</hi> did me all the good which I was likely to get from change of scene&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">after</hi> the letter came my sleep was no better than at Chelsea&#x2014; When I am <hi rend="italic">worried</hi> about anything&#x2014;no <hi rend="italic">air</hi> no surroundings can put me to sleep! At present your curtains are come home and put up.

<salute>Dear Lady Sandwich,</salute>
<p>Your fine cheery little Note, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> came duly, was very pleasant to me here:&#x2014;truly <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was more like a portable &#x201C;phial of sunshine&#x201D; than anything I have met with in these parts! That is a fact; and, I think, a creditable one to the amiable dispenser of such articles, considering all the circumstances!&#x2014;Your Note had no signature; and the address, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was very dashing, seemed to me at first to be in another hand: &#x201C;Has there come some sudden ill turn, then?&#x201D; I said, in my weak imagination;&#x2014;but notices from Chelsea soon put all this to rights; and added new bits of incident (visits to and from in that quarter)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600817-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1860-08-17">17 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> by wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I was still farther gratified and obliged. For some time, again, there has been unpleasant silence in Chelsea; and I have got no news at all,&#x2014;scarcely of my Wife herself, except in scattered snatches. I can only hope there is nothing wrong, there or at Folkstone,&#x2014;that you are profiting by the sea-breezes as I do, that your pretty little Grandchildren make the dull days brighter to you; and that we shall all meet again before long, nothing the worse for our intermediate shiftings and adventures. Of &#x201C;bottled sunshine&#x201D; (except the specimen above alluded to) I have heard not the least whisper in <pb id="pg-36-220" n="36:220"/>these Northern parts: In fact the weather has been one continued gusty drizzle (wind and sea raging as if they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> swallow us, at times); scarcely above one completely bright day; not half a dozen in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the sun has been visible even for moments. The crop is good, for such a country; but is getting all tattered to pieces; not a blade of it yet cut. It is beyond dispute we shall have a very decidedly bad Harvest;&#x2014;the other prognosticated mischief I take to be, let us say, of the nature of &#x201C;bottled <hi rend="italic">darkness</hi>&#x201C;: a commodity of no value whatever, tho&#x2019; we import a good deal of <hi rend="italic">it.</hi></p>
<p>My old Laird<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir George Sinclair.</note> is the best of men; very learned too, and far-travelled; reads me Greek Orations, and bundles of Excerpts and royal and other distinguished Correspondences, till I can stand no more of it: in truth he and his have been so very good and innocent and honestly human and hospitable to me, I am sore of heart to quit them; but the time is come. I go, next Friday, by a Steamer there is to Aberdeen; thence, by rail, southward to Annandale,&#x2014;to Chelsea well before the end of the month, if my computations hold.</p>
<p>From Loch-Luichart there came a Note from the Lady yesterday; the first notice I have had since what you wrote to me. Baby has stood its adventures to perfect<hi rend="italic">n:</hi> Lord A. is still in gout, but evidently recovering; they have been in Brahan till nearly now,&#x2014;the Lady dated from Brahan.

More likely to have been the site of an old <hi rend="italic">limekiln,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cattle-pen</hi> in the outlying fields; that was my deeply private notion;&#x2014;however, I must give you the tradition, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is given in grave enough Books, and is tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> here to have had some vestige of foundation.</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I got your kind message yesterday: except one pleasant little notice of you from Chelsea,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton visited JWC at Cheyne Row <date when="1860-08-21">21 Aug.</date></note> pleasant tho&#x2019; indistinct, I had heard nothing for a long time. I am very happy you and all got safe to the end of your travels;&#x2014;there was among you one small but valuable new member of society, about whom one c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not forbear some anxiety! But she too has prospered, it appears, and taken no hurt by the Highland Inauguration. I can well conceive Grand-Mamma&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa&#x2019;s mother, Mary Elizabeth Frederica Stewart-Mackenzie.</note> feelings at sight of this little Being;&#x2014;may they be prophetic and emblematic of much that lies ahead for the little Wayfarer that has begun its journey on our Earth!</p>
<p>I am right sorry that I cannot see Loch-Luichart again. It is fixed some time since that I am to sail on Friday next for Aberdeen: Friday night, I am to pass you, many miles of land and sea to west of me,&#x2014;all asleep, <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> at the time;&#x2014;and get to Dundee and Linlathen, by rail, next day. There till Tuesday; thence to Annandale, for a short indefinite time; and so home again to my Beating of <pb id="pg-36-222" n="36:222"/>Hemp.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:191.</note> Peaceable day in this world I shall never have till that sad affair is ended. But if my poor nerves will hold out a little (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> never failed me till last summer), I will get thro&#x2019; it one day, and send it (like Christian&#x2019;s Burden, in the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress</hi>) bounding down hill at a <hi rend="italic">pretty</hi> rate!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian, hero of John Bunyan&#x2019;s allegory <hi rend="italic">The Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress</hi> (<date when="1678-00-00">1678</date>), burdened by the conviction of sin and taken to the hill of Calvary, realized that his sins could be forgiven; the burden fell off and rolled down the hill into Christ&#x2019;s sepulcher.</note></p>
<p>I hope Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is fairly getting on his feet again: you have done a great deal of excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> doctoring in that quarter; persist,&#x2014;and keep both the <hi rend="italic">deer</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC thought that rest was healthier than deer hunting for Lord Ashburton; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590818-TC-LOA-01"><sic>35:171</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1859-08-18">18 Aug. 1859</date></corr></ref>.</note> and other doctors at a due distance; that, I believe, to be the law of the case. Mention, please, that I expect a Note at Chelsea soon. For the rest I wish from the heart I heard of you all safe at The Grange again: that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the salutary news, in such a year of tempest!&#x2014;</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Two</hi> letters from you this morning&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">one</hi> redirected from Alderley&#x2014; But I must let the long letter I wrote yesterday go as it is all the same! It is too much writing to throw away&#x2014;after having given myself a head ache over it.</p>
<p>Besides; after having read your two letters of this morning, I feel none the less called upon to defend myself against the charge of &#x201C;huge error,&#x201D; &#x201C;rashness&#x201D; &#x201C;precepitancy&#x201D; &#x201C;folly&#x201D; and so on! I maintain that, however <hi rend="italic">unfortunate</hi> my course may have been, I could not, <hi rend="italic">under the circumstances,</hi> have <hi rend="italic">rightly</hi> taken any other! So the letter of yesterday had best go! Nor do I deign to accept the very beggarly apology you make for my &#x201C;infatuated conduct&#x201C;&#x2014;that I had myself lost heart for the Dumfrieshire visits and was glad of any excuse to be off from them! That tortuous style of thing is not at all in my line!&#x2014;had I lost heart I would [have]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> said so!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On the contrary; feeling myself at Alderley&#x2014;half way&#x2014;all the hateful preparatory lockings-up, and packings well over&#x2014;nothing to do but go north at Crew instead of South&#x2014;and Mary Austin and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell promising me the very warmest welcome! far from losing heart, I had for the first time <hi rend="italic">gained</hi> heart for the further enterprise&#x2014;the &#x201C;interest&#x201D; had &#x201C;not fallen but risen&#x201D; I <pb id="pg-36-223" n="36:223"/>assure you; and I turned south with real mortification! There! you have provoked <hi rend="italic">that</hi> out of me&#x2014;which if &#x201C;well let alone&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441007-JWC-HW-01"><sic>18:231</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1844-10-07">7 Oct. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> I should never have said.</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I meant to have answered your kind Note long before this: but night after night something turns up;&#x2014;in truth, except the &#x201C;4 hours of strict privacy in the morning&#x201D; (never am seen till 2 p.m. and then only running for the sea, to be back at 3 for dinner), I have seldom a moment to myself (except <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> time; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> for instance, just at hand!)</p>
<p>I am coming off in 3 days more; fairly about to lift anchor on Friday next, <pb id="pg-36-224" n="36:224"/>&#x201C;Friday 7<hi rend="italic">th</hi> latish in the afternoon.&#x201D; If all go right, the Friday Steamer, from this neighbourhood, sets me down at Aberdeen, deep in that same Night; next day (Saturday), soon after Noon, I get into the Dundee rail; and am at Mr Erskine&#x2019;s (Linlathen, n<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Dundee) before 4,&#x2014;in good time to rest, and be ready for dinner. At Linlathen till Tuesday; after that Southward again,&#x2014;to Annandale (I still hope), tho&#x2019; it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be to Chelsea, for anything I can certify, all being in doubt to me there. Poor Jane, I fear must be very ill; she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hardly have <hi rend="italic">turned</hi> at Alderley otherwise; and <hi rend="italic">since</hi> her taking that sudden determination, 9 days now, I cannot get the smallest tidings or sign from her: yesterday I had to write to Miss Jewsbury for some exact word, and account of the actual fact whatever it may be; on Saturday <hi rend="italic">this</hi> of Miss Jewsb<hi rend="italic">y</hi> will meet me at Linlathen;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600909-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-09-09">9 Sept.</date></ref></note> and then I shall know my course,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I still hope will be towards a sight of you all.</p>
<p>I have got a great deal of fair sleep (<hi rend="italic">excell</hi>t compared with late Chelsea times); I have been profoundly wearied, solitary, sad; have got <hi rend="italic">some</hi> practising work done; and my head is certainly a little <hi rend="italic">better</hi>, not worse.&#x2014; Did James jun<hi rend="italic">r do</hi> anything about the Cloth-<hi rend="italic">specimens</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600905-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1860-09-05">5 Sept.</date></ref></note> he was speaking of? A Note while I am at Erskine&#x2019;s, the <hi rend="italic">sooner</hi> the surer, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be welcome if it found me. But you need not bother, either.

<p>Oh Bright young Being! as <hi rend="italic">good</hi> as you are bright! I shower thanks on you; and wish them blessings!&#x2014; Your letter, with its inclosure,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kate Stanley wrote, <date when="1860-09-03">3 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;I enclose my photograph &#x2026; with a hope that you will sometimes remember me by seeing it in your book. I did so enjoy your visit here &#x26; I wish it had been longer &#x26; that you had gone on to Scotland to set you quite up for a long autumn &#x26; winter in London.&#x201D;</note> was such a godsend to me this morning!&#x2014; I could have kissed the dear little Sir Joshuaish<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the style of Sir Joshua Reynolds (<date when="1723-00-00">1723</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792-00-00">92</date>), portrait painter.</note> figure, but for the fear of dimming it!&#x2014; Such a Godsend&#x2014;! for I had slept only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> hour thro&#x2019; the past night; and risen with a mind divided betwixt <hi rend="italic">murder</hi> and <hi rend="italic">suicide!</hi> and was in the act of looking thunder and lightening at <pb id="pg-36-225" n="36:225"/>my Old Woman, who had boiled the egg and toasted the bread for my breakfast, and forgotten, up to the moment of placing them before me, to&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">boil the</hi> kettle for my tea!! A moment more; and the most withering sarcasm Indignation could invent would have felled that old woman to the Earth&#x2014;morally speaking&#x2014;! But your letter interposed, and saved me from the impiety of insulting old age&#x2014;however idiotic! For, no sooner had I ascertained it was from you, the letter; and beheld the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bit of fascination</hi>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450723-JWC-TC-01"><sic>19:107</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1845-07-23">23 July 1845</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-19/ lt-18450725-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1845-07-25">25 July 1845</date></ref>.</note> inside, than a great patience, with regard to the tea kettle, flooded my soul! And I owned, that, &#x201C;besides Life and <hi rend="italic">Daily Bread,</hi>&#x201D; that besides even &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Quarterly,</hi> and other <hi rend="italic">Reviews</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Magazines,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Thackeray</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dickens,</hi> fostering the harmless gaiety of Nations&#x201D; (I quote from the Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ross&#x2019;s Sermon)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either from a sermon preached at Alderley (although JWC did not usually attend church) or from Alexander J.

<p>Your Bird is very happy! at least, if <hi rend="italic">chirping</hi> be a sign of happiness, as is generally believed. She is handsomely lodged in a large wire cage, having a <hi rend="italic">wing</hi> devoted to purposes of ablution. Her seed and water are renewed every day, and chick-weed found for her in our garden. For the rest, I talk to her a good deal with a view to opening her mind.</p>
<p>Lady Stanley, whose letter I was particularly glad of, wished to know &#x201C;the end of <hi rend="italic">the Drama.</hi>&#x201D; Rather <hi rend="italic">slow</hi> towards the end I think!

<p>But&#x2014;I have had my revenge!&#x2014; I have written him, with a very bad pen&#x2014;as bad as this one&#x2014;12 pages of <hi rend="italic">reasons</hi> for doing as I did and for believing that, <hi rend="italic">under the circumstances,</hi> I &#x201C;could do no otherwise&#x201D;!&#x2014; How true is this that I read in a french novel the other day: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Sans m&#xEA;me s&#x2019;en apercevoir, presque toujours les hommes nous irritent</hi> [without even noticing, men almost always annoy us]!&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Louis Enault, <hi rend="italic">Nad&#xE8;je</hi> (Paris, <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>) 129.</note> Bless them all the same!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-36-226" n="36:226"/>I gave Miss Stanley&#x2019;s little packet into the hands of a woman who opened the door to me at Dover Street&#x2014;not &#x201C;Mary Ann Hunt&#x201C;&#x2014;who was out, the other told me, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">doing what Miss Stanley had desired her to do&#x2014;looking at Pictures</hi>&#x201D;!!</p>

<p>I got your Letter duly.

He is a truly good creature; loyal and wise as quadruped can be. If I find him reconciled to harness, over and above, it will be a joyful meeting when we come to together again, as I hope!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am in great anxieties about Chelsea: Mrs C. <hi rend="italic">turned back</hi> on her road to Scotland; and now it is the <hi rend="italic">tenth</hi> day that I can hear no word from her at all!&#x2014;The day after tomorrow I quit this place,&#x2014;a most sequestered stormy kindly strange place, with wild shores, looking over into the wild precipices of the Orkneys, and &#x201C;John o&#x2019; Groat&#x2019;s House&#x201D; (if you ever heard of that notability) <pb id="pg-36-227" n="36:227"/>within half a day&#x2019;s riding:&#x2014;a Steamer to Aberdeen (preferable even in the wind) hurries one past many wild friths and chasms, into the region of railways again; on Saturday I pause for 2 days near Dundee (if all go right); thence homeward, by Annandale; <hi rend="italic">home</hi> in a couple of weeks or little more (as I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> fain compute). Printing must recommence; a thing fearful to contemplate! I am certainly a little better,&#x2014;capable of sleep again, tho&#x2019; the head is still slightly disagreeable. I have stuck, for certain hours daily, to my Papers here; it has been my one consolation Tomorrow I am to fold my blottings together again,&#x2014;to be opened in Chelsea yonder. The best address in the interim, sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> anything occur, is &#x201C;Scotsbrig, Ecclefechan N.B.&#x201D;</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley,</salute>
<p>I am very greatly obliged by the kind trouble you took about my Wife. Till yesterday (that is, for ten days) I could not hear the least word about her: she had entirely mistaken my notions about coming home all on the sudden; and I would have given a round sum that she had <hi rend="italic">proceeded,</hi> according to program, instead of turning back. I advised her to start instantly <hi rend="italic">again;</hi> but that she will not hear of.&#x2014; She declares herself visibly benefited by her days at <pb id="pg-36-231" n="36:231"/>Alderley; and celebrates in emphatic terms the hospitable human ways of that Household and its Serene Lady.</p>
<p>I leave this place tomorrow; am within a week to be ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> half-way home,&#x2014;that is to say, in Annandale, my native Country wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you have heard of in old days. How long I halt there depends on the weather, on the &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014; If I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> handily manage to pass by Alderley, you may be sure I shall need no bidding to do it.&#x2014; We have had one bright day out of the 31 I have seen here. But now at last the clouds have got peeled away even up to our latitude (<hi rend="italic">this morning,</hi> at last); and it is hoped the poor world will get its Oatmeal <hi rend="italic">bannocks</hi> cut &#x26; housed after all.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the late harvest, see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600829-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1860-08-29">29 Aug.</date></ref></note></p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I am so sorry that letter should have arrived to mislead you! For alas! I have had no thought of starting again, since I found <hi rend="italic">on my return home,</hi> that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had made a perfectly wrong impression on me as to his plans! When he talked of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">sailing</hi>&#x201D; by such a Steamer; how could I imagine he only meant sailing to <hi rend="italic">Aberdeen&#x2014;</hi>and afterwards making visits in Scotland!&#x2014; He had always declared the attraction of Thurso for him to be the possibility of getting there and back <hi rend="italic">by sea,</hi> &#x201C;without any horror of railwaying&#x201C;&#x2014;and he had never once spoken of returning thro&#x2019; Dumfrieshire!&#x2014; My error was quite natural, almost inevitable&#x2014; But <hi rend="italic">that</hi> doesn&#x2019;t make it the less mortifying for myself and others!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If I had ordinary power of locomotion, I should on perceiving the real state of the case, have streamed off again,&#x2014;this time straight to <hi rend="italic">The Gill.</hi> But indeed, my Dear, I have no such thing as ordinary strength! When I told my Doctor that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C urged me to do this; he fairly swore, tho&#x2019; a very mild man by nature! It was not merely the ground to be gone over but the fuss and flurry of so much travelling for me that he entirely protested against!&#x2014;&#x201C;quiet, quiet, quiet&#x201D; was what I needed above every thing else&#x2014;no change could do me good which involved fatigue or fret of mind&#x2014; I know he is right in that&#x2014;and that no <hi rend="italic">purer air</hi> nor change of scene could do me good if bought with a new unsettling of myself, and the hurry of mind inseparable from travelling&#x2014; <pb id="pg-36-232" n="36:232"/>especially railway travelling&#x2014;for a person whose nervous system is in such a preternatural state of excitability as mine is I should never have had courage to think of going to you at all; but for the week&#x2019;s rest in the middle of the journey offered in the visit to Alderley&#x2014;</p>
<p>It has been a real disappointment to me having had to turn back, and a great provocation to find my turning back unnecessary. But now that I am here I must make the best of it&#x2014;</p>
<p>I will write you a long letter soon and tell you several things about my household affairs which will throw more light for you on the supposed necessity for my abrupt return&#x2014; Today I have M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> George Welsh<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Welsh.</note> here&#x2014;and no leisure for writing&#x2014;but I would not leave you with the doubt which that letter of Lady Ashburtons had excited&#x2014; I am so sorry that I forgot to warn you such letter might come for me!</p>
<p>Lady A and I left London on the same morning. As it would be too late to address to me at Alderley&#x2014;as she would be long on the road on account of <hi rend="italic">the Baby&#x2014;</hi>she asked where I<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC did not notice until she turned the page that TC had already written &#x201C;3) is my favourite&#x201D; in the top left-hand corner; she wrote &#x201C;not seen&#x201D; after it and continued her letter.</note> would be next; that she might write to tell me of the Baby&#x2019;s safe arrival at Braun<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brahan.</note> Castle&#x2014; Thinking I should be with <hi rend="italic">you&#x2014;</hi>before she would be rested enough for writing; I gave her <hi rend="italic">your</hi> address&#x2014;and as I only gave it by word of mouth, I thought she would forget it&#x2014;not so&#x2014;it would seem!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Surely you did not take Lady A&#x2019;s handwriting for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s!! <hi rend="italic">He</hi> leaves Thurso only <hi rend="italic">today</hi> after all!! and where his first stage will be I dont know till I hear from him</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> I am got so far southwards in safety; and hasten (but must <hi rend="italic">first</hi> run upstairs and seek a new pen!) to communicate the fact to you: I hope, but cannot clearly learn, that you will get my note tomorrow morning; at any rate, it is all I can do in that particular,&#x2014;and my <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> shall be by the Post-Office of Broughty to put it in.

<p>The voyage from Thurso was good, in regard to weather and absence of accidents; only we had to haggle and hang off at Aberdeen, for want of tide, 4 or 5 unpleasant hours; and it was, in result 5 a.m. before I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get into a bed (unappointed, unannealed,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 1.5.</note> at that early hour, nothing but a spoonful of raw whisky procurable); so that I had to awaken from my 2 hours of bad sleep with an ugly headache; &#x26; was considerably below par all day, by rail and otherwise. Last night, happily, I have mended much of that (being in the <hi rend="italic">big</hi> room here, the quietest in Nature); and today and tomorrow I mean to be vigilant in all dietetic and other such points, and so be quite myself again before setting out for Scotsbrig.</p>
<p>Geraldine&#x2019;s Letter lay here (thank her for it), giving me but a lowish account of your poor health,&#x2014;in a lower vein than you wrote;&#x2014;however, I am free now from my <hi rend="italic">imaginative</hi> operations on that head; and that is a great relief!&#x2014; I am to be at Scotsbrig on Tuesday night; and hope you will write a word on Monday, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will find me there.</p>
<p>This place is <hi rend="italic">brawer</hi> than usual, looks leafy, verdant, trim; and seems to be more <hi rend="italic">aristocratic</hi> in its ways and aims than formerly. I have got some six or seven hours of good sleep out of it; otherwise little that has not been considerably laden with <hi rend="italic">fash</hi> and bother before it c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> reach me.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>I really could <hi rend="italic">swear</hi>! I am so unlucky! I must give up my pleasant prospect for tomorrow; that I was holding on to with <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> childish glee! &#x201C;An oasis in the Desert&#x201D; (not) of my &#x201C;Crime&#x201D; (as our poetical Lord Mayor said of Pulniger&#x2019;s frank confession)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William George Pullinger (b. <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>), chief cashier of the Union Bank of London, Princess St., confessed, <date when="1860-04-19">19 April</date>, to having &#x201C;abstracted large sums [&#xa3;263,<hi rend="italic">070</hi>] from the charges taken over to the Bank of England, which he had concealed from the ledger-keeper by exhibiting to him a fabricated pass-book, in which the balance agreed with what it appeared in the accountant&#x2019;s general ledger&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1860-04-25">25 April</date>). In court, before the lord mayor, John Carter (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>), Pullinger pleaded guilty: &#x201C;I do not wish to give any unnecessary trouble.&#x201D; He completely exonerated his junior colleague Edward John Lyttleton of any blame, and it was for this that the lord mayor said: &#x201C;It is a bright oasis in the desert of his guilty career that he exhibits so much sensibility&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1860-05-05">5 May</date>). On leaving court, Pullinger issued a public statement that he had &#x201C;done his utmost to atone for his crime by assigning everything he had in the world to the Union Bank, leaving his wife without a bed of her own to lie upon, and without other clothes than those which she wore at the time&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1860-05-05">5 May</date>).</note> but of my misfortune! I went by rail to Norwood<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About 5 mi. SE of Chelsea.</note> <pb id="pg-36-235" n="36:235"/>on Friday for &#x201C;cange of air&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted; TC inserted &#x201C;[h].&#x201D; Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520526-TC-JAC-01"><sic>27:121</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1852-09-02">2 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> for half an hour&#x2014;when feeling very sick, I ought (my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> says) to have lain down instead&#x2014;the result was, that I returned in a state for bed&#x2014;where I had to remain all yesterday with horrible headach and sore-throat&#x2014; I am better to day but so broken &#x201C;to smithers&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570902-JWC-TC-01"><sic>33:65</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1857-09-02">2 Sept. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and my throat not quite mended tho&#x2019; the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> has given me something to take for it exactly like light-blue oil-paint (!)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly German chamomile, of which the main therapeutic properties are analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antiseptic; its main ingredient, azulene, gives it a deep blue color (Gill Farrer-Hall, <hi rend="italic">The Aromatherapy Bible</hi> [<date when="2005-00-00">2005</date>] 274).</note> which has been of quite magical benefit<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC later wrote above the line: &#x201C;(That I remember well).&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Even should I be still better tomorrow, it would be too indiscreet to go out&#x2014;especially in the evening&#x2014;and besides, I am always so happy at your dinners; and happiness, by its extreme rarity, <hi rend="italic">excites</hi> me more than any other sort of emotion&#x2014;</p>
<p>My love to your husband&#x2014;hoping to meet under more favourable circumstances when you return&#x2014;</p>

<dateline>5 Cheyne Row &#x2F; Sunday night <date when="1860-09-09">[9&#x2013;10 September 1860]</date></dateline>
<p><salute>Oh my Dear!</salute> Was there ever such a game at cross purposes as this correspondence of ours! It reminds me of nothing so much as the passages between the &#x201C;wee Wifie who lived in a shoe&#x201D; and her Bairns, so many &#x201C;that she didn&#x2019;t know what to do&#x201D;!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-36-236" n="36:236"/>&#x201C;She went to the market to buy them a sheeps-head;</p>
<p>When she came back they were all lying dead!</p>
<p>She went to the Wrights to get them a coffin;</p>
<p>When she came back they were all sitting laughing!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Not one letter you have written to me since you went away has hit the right state of things! Do the best that ever you could!-your &#x201C;sheeps head&#x201D; and your &#x201C;coffin&#x201D; have been equally out of time!&#x2014; Such being, I suppose, the natural result of going where an answer to ones letters cannot be received in less than six days&#x2014;in a world where nothing keeps still.</p>
<p>Your last letter, received on Saturday morning, expressing your relief from anxieties about me, found me a more legitimate object of anxiety than I had been at all since your departure! at least found me <hi rend="italic">thinking myself so!</hi> For, thank God <hi rend="italic">this</hi> attack if very violent while it lasted, has passed off unexpectedly soon.</p>
<p>I suppose if I had followed M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes&#x2019;s directions about lying down in the middle of the day, instead of yielding to popular clamour about &#x201C;change of air&#x201D;; the thing would have been avoided altogether. On Friday morning down came Geraldine all agog at having had a letter from you, and insisted that we should make one of those &#x201C;excursions&#x201D; I had talked of I had my &#x201C;sickness&#x201D; (as I call it) worse than usual that morning and begged to be off from any adventure&#x2014;but a &#x201C;breath of Norwood air would do me so much good!&#x201D; &#x201C;It would take off the sickness to sit on the hill side &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x201C;&#x2014; I didn&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> that it would, but foolishly yielded to &#x201C;reason&#x201D; rather than instinct&#x2014;the movement made me sicker and sicker; still, I had fortitude to order dinner (a nice little roasted chicken and bottle of soda water) at the best Hotel;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> and to force myself to eat some of it too! at an open bow-window with such a &#x201C;beautiful view&#x201C;&#x2014; But oh how I wished myself in my bed at home with no view to speak of! For I had grown all burning-hot and ice-cold&#x2014;not a square inch of me at the same temperature! and &#x201C;my head like a mall&#x201D;!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I got home better or worse, and went to bed, and lay, or rather tossed about all night in a high fever, with a racking headach, severe sickness, and, most questionable of all, a bad sore throat. I only waited for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes being up to send for him&#x2014;tho&#x2019; he had given me up as a <hi rend="italic">patient!</hi> Without having had a wink of sleep however, or anything &#x201C;to do me good,&#x201D; my fever abated of itself as the morning advanced; and after having had some tea in bed between seven and eight (&#x201C;all very <hi rend="italic">con</hi>fortable&#x201D; from the new woman;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Tall Charlotte.&#x201D;</note> I felt so much better that I should have held my hand from sending for a D<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> if it hadn&#x2019;t been for the sore-throat, which continued very bad, and frightened me, from its unusual nature&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes was out and didn&#x2019;t come in to get the message <pb id="pg-36-237" n="36:237"/>till three o&#x2019;clock; by which time I had transferred myself to the Drawingroom sofa&#x2014; Meanwhile, being still in bed&#x2014;but washed and combed, and the room <hi rend="italic">tidied</hi> up in expectation of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes&#x2014;there was sent up to me the card of Madame Usedom! two hours after I had read your wish that I should call for her! And I heard her <hi rend="italic">voice</hi> in the passage! I sent down polite &#x201C;regrets&#x201D; in the first instance, then, thinking <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would be vexed at my not admitting her&#x2014;I called Charlotte (&#x201C;Charlotte&#x201D; the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) back, and said, to tell the Lady, if she wouldnt dislike coming to me in my bedroom, that I should be glad to see her &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">for a minute</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; If I had known that she was to flop down on the bed and cover my face with <hi rend="italic">kisses</hi> (!) the first thing; I should have thought twice of admitting her&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">with the sore-throat</hi> I had! However!&#x2014;the thing was done!&#x2014;so I didnt say a word of sore-throat to put infection in her head&#x2014;and indeed I <hi rend="italic">hoped</hi> it <hi rend="italic">mightn&#x2019;t</hi> be of an infectious nature. As for the &#x201C;minute&#x201D; she prolonged it to an hour, talking with an emphasis and an exaggeration and a velocity and cordiality which left me little to do but listen and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> scream! I will tell you all I remember of her talk when we meet&#x2014; She will be again in London towards the end of <date when="1860-10-00">October</date> She went off with the same or rather with redoubled embracings and kissings&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">I,</hi> purposely, <hi rend="italic">holding in my breath!</hi> and when the door had closed, didn&#x2019;t I fall back on my pillows! with a sense of relief!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes looked into my throat, and said it was bad&#x2014;but if I had &#x201C;courage to swallow the very ugliest and most extraordinary looking medicine I had ever seen in this world, he thought he could cure it in a day or two&#x201C;&#x2014;and there came a bottle containing apparently bright <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> oil-paint!! It <hi rend="small-caps">did</hi> need courage and faith to take the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> doze of that! But &#x201C;I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> it Sir&#x201D;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201D; &#x2018;I did it, sir,&#x2019;&#x2014; Blusterous pedagogue, a Welsh Archdeacon Williams, head of the Edinburgh New Academy (who used to call at Comely Bank, reporting to us his dreadful illness he once had, illness miserable and fatal &#x2018;unless you can dine for three weeks without wine&#x2019;&#x2014;&#x2019;and I did it, sir!&#x2019;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s headnote in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:55).

<p><salute>Oh Lady fair and dear!</salute> My mischances of late have been so outrageous, that I think of working them up into a Farce, to be called <hi rend="italic">the Unlucky Woman</hi>.</p>
<p>But I haven&#x2019;t quite made up my mind whether to do <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> or let myself go to an <hi rend="italic">acc&#xE8;s</hi> [fit] of misanthropy!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, under the possibility, that some day I may lay my misfortunes at your feet&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">dramatized;</hi> I shall abstain from troubling you with a literal account of them here; except in so far as is necessary to explain my delay in answering your letter. In the first place, that letter was detained from day to day, thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">four</hi> days at Holme Hill;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Russell&#x2019;s home.</note> in the fond hope, <hi rend="italic">excited by its own appearance,</hi> that I would arrive to claim it! For alas! I had never reached Holme Hill&#x2014;never got further North than Alderley! My week there was <pb id="pg-36-239" n="36:239"/>hardly expired, when I had &#x201C;felt it my duty&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450628-JWC-JWE-01"><sic>19:88</sic><corr>JWC to JWE, <date when="1845-06-28">28 June 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> to stream back to Cheyne Row to prepare for my Husband! who, all in writing (as Sir George Sinclair says) &#x201C;immortal pages for Unborn Generations&#x201D; had written an uncommonly stupid, confusedly expressed page for his own <hi rend="italic">born</hi> Wife! leading her to suppose that he would sail from Thurso straight to London by the next Steamer. And what <hi rend="italic">could</hi> she do, the poor wretch of a Wife, under the circumstances&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">his</hi> bed curtains at the Cleaner&#x2019;s!&#x2014;all the keys locked up <hi rend="italic">unlabelled</hi> in <hi rend="italic">the piano!&#x2014;</hi>the house in charge of an old &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Treasure,</hi>&#x201D; who had turned out as <hi rend="italic">Treasures</hi> generally do, a most &#x201C;beggarly account of empty boxes&#x201D;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi> 5.1.</note>&#x2014;under such circumstances what <hi rend="italic">could</hi> she do, but just what she did&#x2014;rush wildly home!&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a huge error</hi>&#x201D; on her part! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has since loftily declared; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a miserable infatuation</hi>&#x201D;! &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">A sheer Chimera of the female Brain</hi>&#x201D;! But all these epithets applied to my proceeding dont alter the fact, that I have been cheated out of my holiday by his having failed to make his meaning intelligible!</p>
<p>To go back again&#x2014;to do all the journey to Dumfrieshire at one fell rush, was not to be thought of. My D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> positively prohibited me from thinking of it! In the shock given to my mind and purposes, I forgot to warn M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell that a letter might come for me. Nay&#x2014;to say the real truth I had never hoped that you would recollect the long direction, without having it written down for you! So when your letter arrived, she took it as a sign that her entreaties, I would start again, and come to her after all, had proved effectual; and went on for four days keeping the letter, and sending the carriage to the Station for me at all probable hours!!! I should tell you that she mistook your writing on the back for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s!! thus strengthening herself in her &#x201C;huge error&#x201D;; for of course M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C must know the movements of his own wife?</p>
<p>When the letter at last reached me with this explanation; it found me too <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> to write. I thought myself about to wind up a most unlucky summer by dying of <hi rend="italic">the new sore throat!</hi> Perhaps I should; but for the most magical medicine I ever had given me in this world! A substance or rather liquid exactly like <hi rend="italic">bright blue oil-paint!&#x2014;</hi>which having swallowed, with a faith and a courage not common, two tablespoonfuls of; in a quarter of an hour I was cured! sitting up, <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> for my sore throat, and unable to find it!</p>
<p>The weather is now quite cold enough for being in London without regret. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is by this time in Annandale, where I should think he would not make a long stay. Anyhow I am not at all dull; and see as many people as are good for me. It is quite extraordinary how people turn up for one at this season when there is &#x201C;nobody in Town&#x201C;&#x2014; Do you know Baroness Usedom? She sat an hour by my bedside the other day and I had never exchanged words with her in my life before! Charlotte Wynn has been in town again and is off to Weymouth<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seaside town in Dorset. Charlotte Williams Wynn wrote from Weymouth to Julia Sterling, <date when="1860-09-12">12 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;I came a week ago, but my sisters only followed yesterday.

<p><salute>My poor Jeannie,&#x2014;</salute>I got hither last night,&#x2014;3 hours later than appoint<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> for reasons you shall hear;&#x2014;and was shocked to hear of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> bad adventure again on y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> new sally out for health. The Letter lay on the Table here; and I had to gallop thro&#x2019; it, with hardly a look at my new old-friends who were all gathered about me with kind eager looks. Thank Heaven it seems to have ended (if as I hope that was the <hi rend="italic">end</hi>) much better than we might have apprehended: the only thing I can say is, my poor Goody is clearly very feeble indeed,&#x2014;weak as water, poor soul,&#x2014;and must venture<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC presumably omitted &#x201C;not.&#x201D;</note> on attempts of that nature again, but follow her own &#x201C;instincts,&#x201D; and the advice of Barnes so far as sound. One other good circumstance is, I can now hear from and inquire about within the space of a day, according to the old custom. I doubt you did not get the Linlathen Letter till <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> morning, after all. I walked down with it 3 good <pb id="pg-36-241" n="36:241"/>hours before Post-time; and came back all in a broil, for new walking with Erskine, but with a conscience comfortable on that small point:&#x2014;to no purpose; so severe is the Sabbatic Ordinance in those hag-ridden localities!</p>
<p>My 3 days at Linlath<hi rend="italic">n</hi> were very well on the whole; the MacNab and all the others (except the M<hi rend="italic">c</hi>Kellars, one of the<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably for &#x201C;them.&#x201D;</note> stone-blind, poor young woman) had all gradually gone before me; so that Erskine and his flowing discourse, of the old mellifluous evangelic descript<hi rend="italic">n</hi> belonged all to myself for the last half day; &#x26; I was glad to have seen the good man once again and his high dwelling&#x2019;s walls amid the beautiful Scotch Autumn. He despatched me yesterday morning, at a quarter to 10, in his choicest mood. My journey was very supportable till just at the end. Indeed it was first-rate for a railway journey: pipe of tobacco in each of the Two Friths;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tay and Forth, both of which were crossed by boat.</note> Peter Swan<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Patrick (Peter) Don Swan.</note> discovered in the Steamer of the latter Frith, &#x26; from him in consequence an appoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to lunch &#x201C;at the Northern Club, George Street,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Northern Club, 91 George St., Edinburgh.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> helped to consume the vacant 2&#xBD; hours, and otherwise proved useful:&#x2014;in fine all was well enough till, on arriving at <hi rend="italic">Beattock</hi> (n<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Moffat), already a good while behind our time, we heard there had an accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> occurred on <hi rend="italic">our</hi> line of rail some miles ahead (accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to a <hi rend="italic">goods</hi> train and its engine); wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> us to a dead halt, and necessitated such telegraphing squeaking, pilot-engining, and unintelligible shuttling to and fro, as was enough to disgust a plain human creature (unfriendly to Fitzsmithytrough),<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s fictional railway magnate; see &#x201C;Hudson&#x2019;s Statue,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets, Works</hi> 20:277.</note> and as wasted about near 2 hours more of our time bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> that and Lockerby. At Lockerby Jamie, I knew, was waiting with a gig,&#x2014;generously volunteering to take me out <hi rend="italic">there,</hi> and save <hi rend="italic">me</hi> two hours of waiting I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have had otherwise. Jamie waited from 6.46 p.m. till past 9 before I turned up; and everybody here was in alarm when at last we did arrive here,&#x2014;all safe &#x26; right, only confused, hungry, cold, and with one&#x2019;s mind all in a puddle.</p>
<p>Hang it! There is the Post hour,&#x2014;hours <hi rend="italic">earlier</hi> than usual;&#x2014;I must instantly close! I design to rest here perhaps 2 days I will try to write a more definite word tomorrow. I am well enough; and have had, in confused pieces, a good share of sleep.</p>

<p>There! I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> good you see! I don&#x2019;t wait till I have heard from Scotsbrig, but write on &#x2018;the voluntary principle&#x2019; to reassure your mind on that &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">blue paint</hi>&#x2019;; in case it have &#x2018;taken effect on it&#x2019;! I myself had some apprehension that so magical a cure of the sore throat would cost me something in shock to the stomach&#x2014;or &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">system.</hi>&#x2019; But no such thing! I have been better than usual in every way.</p>
<p>Today, I am going for a drive in my <hi rend="italic">neat</hi> Fly, and have undertaken to make out the failed appointment with Fuzz on Friday. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Forster came over to arrange it the same day she got my note of apology.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Gilchrist is come home,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly from a visit to her mother, Henrietta Burrows, at Earls Colne in Essex.</note> which I am rather glad of.</p>

<p>Geraldine has been very obliging and attentive; but Oh Heaven! what a fuss she does make with everything she does! and how wonderfully little sense she has! As a sample of her practical conduct; the unlucky day we went to Norwood, she left behind her at the Hotel, a silk neckerchief and an Aluminium broach (a love-token from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barlow!)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev.

On the way home she left her new silk parasol in the Railway waiting room!! She bragged to me that she had gone second class. I asked what the saving was&#x2014; When she came to calculate, it was found the &#x201C;cha&#x2019;arge&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520805-JWC-TC-01"><sic>27:206&#x2013;7</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1852-08-05">5 Aug. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> first class (with a return ticket) was eighteen pence.

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Sir George</hi>,</salute>
<p>I arrived here, at my half-way house, the night before last; without accident to speak of, indeed with what may be called &#x201C;a pleasant voyage,&#x201D; both by sea and land, if any such could now be pleasant: nevertheless I feel considerably smashed; and, for the present, at least twenty per cent. below what you and Thurso Castle delivered me at, that morning, in Scrabster Roads.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scrabster Roads, i.e., the sheltered bay at Scrabster; &#x201C;roads&#x201D; or &#x201C;roadsteads&#x201D; were generally less enclosed than harbors but safe for anchoring.</note> Alas, one has to voyage; and there is no wishing-carpet or Fortunatus&#x2019;s hat<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Favorite image of the Carlyles for traveling; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300806-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:132</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-08-06">6 Aug. 1830</date></corr></ref>, and Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 191 and 342.</note> to do it with, in these modern steam-days!</p>
<p>At Linlathen there fell out of my portmanteau two books,&#x2014;a chamber Bible, and a volume of Heinrich,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a vol. of Christoph Gottlob Heinrich, <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der teutschen Reichsgeschichte,</hi> 8 vols.

After consideration, I left them at &#x201C;Corona&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Corona House, 12 West Dock St., Broughty Ferry, offices of Alexander Stephen &#x26; Sons, shipbuilders.</note> to the care of Mr. Stephen junior; charging him to be so kind as to send them over at once to Mrs. Power;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emilia Power was probably staying at the Sinclair family house, 133 George St., Edinburgh.</note> by whom they were to be delivered to your Edinburgh bookseller,&#x2014;and by him, as I hope, reconsigned shortly to their real place of ownership. Please mention that they do arrive uninjured, when and if they do. Chelsea will be the address; in a few days I am to start off thither again, there to get upon the treadwheel again,&#x2014;sinner that I am!</p>
<p>Mr. Erskine was well, and all about him looking very happy. We had plenty of pious discourse for the two days I stayed; he sent many compliments to &#x201C;the good Sir George;&#x201D; and I did not forget the tradition of the turbot<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably not a reference to the saying &#x201C;Visitors, like fish, go off after two days&#x201D; since TC had just stayed for several weeks with Sir George.</note> we once heard of.</p>
<p>Adieu, dear Sir, and thousand thanks for all your unwearied kindnesses and human hospitalities to me, which were <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> as one seldom finds them in this world. To Miss Sinclair<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either Sir George&#x2019;s sister Catherine, or his unmarried da., Olivia.</note> my lasting remembrances and regards.</p>

<p><salute>Well you are a good little soul,&#x2014;</salute>now and then;&#x2014;and this morning especially your Note was a comfort to me. For in truth I was not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my anxieties ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that &#x201C;bright blue paint&#x201D;; nor am I quite <hi rend="italic">yet,</hi> tho&#x2019; hitherto all runs so fair. We must hope it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> over, as the symptoms encouragingly say; in the meanwhile you will take every precaution, won&#x2019;t you?&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> let me want for Letters either till once I get back to Chelsea, and can see with eyes! That, so far as yet computable, will not be a long date.</p>
<p>Yesterday I closed abruptly, on an alarm (partly premature) of the Postman&#x2019;s passing. Today I am hopelessly too late, not with <hi rend="italic">this,</hi> but with a <hi rend="italic">trashery</hi> of Notes (half a score others, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> nothing at all, and be hanged to them!)&#x2014; I mean therefore to clear off the whole lot before rising, and <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> to Ecclefechan with them myself, for exercise in my peculiar circumstances,&#x2014;sad peculiar, in a small way, as you shall hear.</p>
<p>Last night, namely, making every preparation for a good sleep, of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I had abundant need, I went to bed at 11; and was thrice over falling into the delightfullest sea of rest (being utterly tired, and a pill in me), when, owing to a mighty wind wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had risen in the S.W. some slight <hi rend="italic">rattle</hi> in my poor windows thrice over awoke me again: and, in evil hour, I got up to <hi rend="italic">wedge</hi> the thing away, and quite conquer it;&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the <hi rend="italic">pill</hi> and my other perverse appendages took in high dudgeon, and which the peccant window took in utter contempt, <hi rend="italic">then</hi> and as often after as I liked to try! Result was, I had almost no sleep at all,&#x2014;3 hours of stony stupor, from 7 to 10 a. m, after ducking in my tub, being the main part of it; and today I have risen a far other man than I expected! Never bother; I will have <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> wedges tonight; and on a cup of little Jenny&#x2019;s excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> chicken-broth, with a modicum of porridge, and both walking and riding, I prophesy complete reversal of the present tragic condition.</p>
<p>I am in no case for scheming and appointing at present; but I already counted and today more than ever count it probable that I shall make no loitering in Annandale; but reappear in Chelsea in a few days!

I am alone amid the grey autumn winds.

<salute>Dear Stirling,</salute>
<p>I am very happy indeed to hear of you again, after so long an abeyance: abeyance caused by I know not what on your part; caused on mine by the sad fact that I am buried alive, under rubbish and sand, for years past, to the extinct<hi rend="italic">n</hi> almost of life itself; and can yet say nothing about getting out, if I ever get out!

<p><salute>Oh my Dear!</salute> How very ill I like to hear of your making wedges! It would have been much better if you had kept to your original intention of &#x201C;sailing there and back&#x201C;&#x2014; But since you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> on the railway line, for Godsake take it easy! I wish you would break the journey home by staying a couple of days at Alderley, Those long railway journeys are ruinous for anybody with <hi rend="italic">a head.</hi> If you <hi rend="italic">would</hi> take it easy, and arrive here in tolerable condition you would find both &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>&#x2019; and &#x2018;fresh air&#x2019; to your hearts content.</p>
<p>I am perfectly miserable today. Those Forsters&#x2014;or rather <hi rend="italic">that</hi> Forster with his dinner-invitations, which he forces down one&#x2019;s throat, is a real affliction to me! It seems so unkind to resist him, and he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not understand that there are conditions in which lying on a sofa at one&#x2019;s own fire side is better for one than &#x2018;dining&#x2019; with even choice spirits like him!</p>
<p>There have been most pernicious East winds lately and yesterday I got a whiff of cold just in going to the closet of the spare room, where the windows were all flying open&#x2014; So I had a bad night, aggravated by the horrible thought of that dinner; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be got off from a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> time&#x2014;if I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> go at all.&#x2014; Miss Cunningham<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Cunningham (ca. <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">67</date>), long known to JWC (see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410422-JWC-TC-01"><sic>13:109</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1841-04-22">22 April 1841</date></corr></ref>), da. of TC&#x2019;s old friend Allan Cunningham (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), poet and songwriter, and Jean Cunningham (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380703-JWC-JWCU-01"><sic>10:111</sic><corr>JWC to JWCU, <date when="1838-07-03">3 July 1838</date></corr></ref>).</note> had been asked to meet me on the former occasion, and had been put off till the day I should say which was today!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If I get worse before Forster brings the carriage for me at five o&#x2019;clock, I must just mortally affront him by refusing to go&#x2014;but even without getting worse, regard for my present comfort, and fear of consequences tomorrow would keep me at home.</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>I finished out my trashery of Notes yesterday, before rising; took an ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> walk with Jamie over the green uplands in the grey wind, returning to a succinct dietetic dinner after 6; was punctual to rules every way;&#x2014;and ended by <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> from half past ten to half past 6, and again (under dreamy circumstances, poor Jeffrey<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis, Lord Jeffrey; perhaps in TC&#x2019;s mind because their last meeting, <date when="1849-09-00">Sept. 1849</date> (see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490915-TC-JWC-01"><sic>24:232</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1849-09-15">15 Sept. 1849</date></corr></ref>), was on another journey southward, when TC also failed to visit William Stirling; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600913-TC-WS-01">TC to WS, <date when="1860-09-13">13 Sept.</date></ref></note> and many other figures confusedly appearing) from shortly after 7 till 9 had struck. So that today I am a new man,&#x2014;30 per cent beyond yesterday, tho&#x2019; still a good few degrees below my old Thurso state. I get terribly cut up by travelling.

<p>I have been here since Saturday afternoon: breakfast and its appendages was hardly off the scene there, that morning,&#x2014;happily with <hi rend="italic">no</hi> Letters (one from the Doctor,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

As the day was dry, in the middle of wet or uncertain ones, and the drive like to do me good, I came off luggage and all,&#x2014;perceptibly benefited by my drive. Indeed I have had a great deal of (irregular) sleep and bodily accommodation since you heard last; and am pretty much up to par again, tho&#x2019; my head is still rather <hi rend="italic">dour</hi> and occasionally disagreeable and <hi rend="italic">musical.</hi> Nothing to speak of!

<p>You will open this, prepared to hear that I went to Forsters, and have been very ill in consequence. If there be a choice betwixt a wise thing and a foolish one&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">woman</hi> is always expected to do the <hi rend="italic">foolish.</hi> Well, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> didn&#x2019;t! Very ill I have been&#x2014;but not from going out to dinner. By one oclock that day I was quite ill enough to care no more for Fuzz&#x2019;s wrath than for a whiff of tobacco! I had taken the <hi rend="italic">Influenza,</hi> and no doubt about it! So I despatched a message to Montague Square&#x2014;and another message to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes&#x2014;went to bed, and have not left it till within the last hour! So provoking! I had been so much better, and hoped to be quite flourishing on your return. Howsomdever<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> an Influenza properly treated and an Influenza allowed to treat itself&#x2014;like all my former ones&#x2014;is a very different affair I find! It has not been allowed to settle down on my chest at all, this one&#x2014;and after only three days of sharp suffering, here I am in the drawing-room!&#x2014;looking forward with some interest to the <hi rend="italic">sweetbread</hi> I am to dine on! and writing you a letter better or worse!&#x2014; The new woman<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Tall Charlotte.&#x201D;</note> is a good nurse! very quiet, and kindly, and with sense to do things without being told. I have not had my clothes folded neatly up, and the room <hi rend="italic">tidied,</hi> and my wants anticipated in this way since I had no longer my Mother to nurse me.</p>
<p>In ordinary circumstances I should have felt it horrid to be lying entirely at the mercy of an utter stranger&#x2014;but being as she is, I have wished no one else to come near me&#x2014;</p>
<p>Even <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I rather hope may <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come this week&#x2014; It would worry me so, not to be able to run about when you come&#x2014;and I must be cautious for some days yet&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Mrs Prudence</hi>&#x201D;! as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes calls me in <hi rend="italic">mockery!&#x2014;</hi> The girl is to come tomorrow<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah had originally been engaged to begin <date when="1860-09-14">14 Sept.</date>; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600826-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1860-08-26">26 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;but I dont feel to trouble my head about <hi rend="italic">her.</hi> Charlotte (2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) can be trusted to direct her in the way she should go&#x2014;till I am well enough to meddle!&#x2014;besides I have every reason to believe her a nice girl. The old Charlotte, poor foolish thing is still hanging on at her &#x2018;Mother&#x2019;s&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Southam, her aunt, living nearby in Lawrence St.</note> just <pb id="pg-36-251" n="36:251"/>as untidy in her person with <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to do, as she used to be in her press of work. She has been much about me&#x2014;and I dont know what I should have done without her, to <hi rend="italic">cook</hi> for me and show me some human kindness when I was ill <hi rend="italic">under</hi> &#x201C;Old Jane&#x201C;&#x2014; But I am glad at the same time that I had fortitude to resist her tears and her request to be taken back as Cook. I told her, <hi rend="italic">some day</hi> I might take her back but she had much to learn and to unlearn first. Still it is gratifying to feel that ones kindness to the girl has not been all lost on her for she really <hi rend="italic">loves</hi> both of us passionately only that passionate loves, not applied to practical uses are good for so little in this matter of fact world!</p>

Down in Influenza, in spite of all your bits of struggles; suffering, feeble, and nobody there but servants and strangers.&#x2014; You put the best face you can on the matter; but it is evidently a very bad job! It was very kind of you, too, to write me a little Note ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the real fact that had befallen: I might easily have taken to imagining, had you kept silent, that it was even worse. Send me, if you can at all, one word daily till we meet again. And keep up your little heart, Dearest; and be quiet, and obey Barnes! You do not easily lose heart; a valiant little soul, courageous abundantly: through ups and downs, I will hope (if what you tell me today be no <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than the truth) to find you well reemerged when I return.</p>
<p>I had tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Friday for returning; but will try and examine farther what can be done to give you more time.

<p>Just one line Dear to keep your &#x2018;Imagination&#x2019; quiet. I am <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> very well; nothing to complain of now, but the weakness and <hi rend="italic">lowness</hi> consequent on that horrid Influenza. And as I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> eat, and am begun to sleep, I expect in a little while to be &#x201C;in my frail ordinar thank God&#x201C;&#x2014;(as Jackie Welsh writes)</p>
<p>But I am <hi rend="italic">sort of</hi> stunned today! George Cooke sent a man with a note to tell me &#x201C;in case I did not know already&#x201C;&#x2014;that poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Godby is lying dangerously ill, &#x201C;had not been expected to survive the night&#x2014;and two of the children were lying ill too&#x2014; Her Mother was with her&#x2014;telegraphed for I believe&#x2014;but I don&#x2019;t know what the illness is, or anything about it except that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Godby and the Children had been staying some where in the Country for six weeks. and she seems to have returned to The Post Office <hi rend="italic">ill,</hi> about a fortnight ago. I am so sorry to learn this, when tied here hand and foot!&#x2014; As much as my own life is worth to go to them&#x2014;and up to no nursing or <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> if I were there!</p>
<p>George Cooke will do all <hi rend="italic">he</hi> can do, and will send me word daily&#x2014; But poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Binnie in a place so <hi rend="italic">unheimlich</hi> [dismal] for her! on such a heavy errand!</p>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> wish you would rest at Alderley&#x2014;not merely for the sake of taking half of your black doze at a time&#x2014;so far as the disagreeableness is concerned; but for the sake of the difference of <hi rend="italic">injury to one&#x2019;s head</hi> done by two hundred miles of railway travelling and four hundred!&#x2014; If the affair were over when the doze is <hi rend="italic">swallowed,</hi> I shouldnt mind.</p>
<p>If Mary <hi rend="italic">should</hi> offer you a little pot of butter be sure you take it. Also about new meal? <hi rend="italic">Is</hi> there any yet? Ours is very bitter become.</p>
<p>I wrote to Addiscombe when I started for Alderly&#x2014;to discontinue <hi rend="italic">the Hamper&#x2014;</hi>and <hi rend="italic">couldnt</hi> for shame warn them that I was back in a week!&#x2014; I miss the Addiscombe butter very much&#x2014;none here so good&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Sir</salute>
<p>While you have been enjoying yourself on the Continent, I have been having a bad Influenza at home.</p>
<p>But I am now able to be in the Drawingroom and able to get good of seeing you. So pray come to tea on Thursday evening&#x2014;and for your pains you shall make the acquaintance of one of our cleverest female Novelists<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.

Of other women novelists that JWC knew, she admired George Eliot but did not meet her socially, and it seems unlikely that Georgiana Craik was back in London, having been there in <date when="1860-06-00">June</date>; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600618-JWC-GCMC-01">JWC to <sic>GC and MC</sic><corr>GCMC</corr>, <date when="1860-06-18">18 June</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Perhaps you think that is not saying much!</p>

<dateline>The Gill, <date when="1860-09-19">19 Sept<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> 1860</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest,</salute> for your punctual news; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, tho&#x2019; it is rather of sad tenor in several points, is a great benefit and relief to me. I am just got back from Scotsbrig, in a feeble tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">successful</hi> &#x201C;physicky&#x201D; state; had there been no letter at all, I sh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> have been finely off!&#x2014; I have hardly a few minutes of time before the Post go; and write you a word in great hurry.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs Godby&#x2019;s is a bad business; and must have given <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a great shock to hear of it on the sudden in your present state. Poor woman, it is very sad and miserable; but one hopes strongly she will get thro&#x2019;, having <hi rend="italic">Youth</hi> to help her; and that all will clear up again in that quarter. Do not you fret about it (no <pb id="pg-36-257" n="36:257"/><hi rend="italic">help</hi> is in you, or in any mortal almost); especially do not fret about your total inability for anything but wishing in regard to it. The old mother is likely to be the very best of nurses and managers in such a situation; and will keep up her own heart and her poor Daughter&#x2019;s better than hundreds of other more refined people w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do:-in no case <hi rend="italic">try</hi> in the least to go near it; nothing <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be so irrational on your part. Attend to this now; and understand that, now and afterwards, you are commanded to keep entirely <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of the affair, and to lie still when you are as absolutely unfit for the smallest attempt that way. If I have any authority over you, that is my strict injunction, as well as my passionate request, as head of the house in this sore season, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> we hope will not last!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I went thro&#x2019; all my poor and sad tasks yesterday in their due series; I slept rather better than usual (expect now to begin sleeping really well); and today (after the 2 hours drive, I, for the first time, have a kind of <hi rend="italic">appetite</hi> towards the soup or other edibles wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are probably getting ready fast for Jamie and me. Poor Jamie he has quitted his harvest, and made this second day&#x2019;s work of driving to fulfil all my notions. Jack goes home with him; and I do not return <pb id="pg-36-258" n="36:258"/>to Scotsbrig. Mary, no doubt, will have a little pot of butter; but there is yet no new meal at all: perhaps better <hi rend="italic">wait</hi> till in a week or two both butter and meal be ready together?&#x2014; Jean is here duly;&#x2014;set to mend a pair of drawers for me in the distance. She will not be a bother; and I expect to be much better let alone. I will think again of <hi rend="italic">Alderley;</hi> but today I have time to think of nothing. Let me pray for good news tomorrow! Adieu, my poor Goody</p>

<p><salute>Thanks Dear!&#x2014;</salute> What a blessing it is to be able to get an answer to a letter without waiting <hi rend="italic">a week</hi> for it!</p>
<p>I had a good sleep last night&#x2014;the best&#x2014;the most <hi rend="italic">human</hi> for weeks back! but, as a first good sleep always does, it has made me very dull and lazy today. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes has just left me with directions; &#x201C;Be sure you eat your <hi rend="italic">sole,</hi> and drink your wine, and go early to bed, and <hi rend="italic">dont,</hi> theres a good woman, be <hi rend="italic">writing,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bothering your brains&#x2014;</hi>but keep quite quiet&#x201D;!&#x2014; So you see I must put you off with a mere bulletin&#x2014;</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Wedgwood<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Wedgwood.</note> came yesterday and brought me some grapes&#x2014;very welcome! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Gilchrist says they are &#x201C;half a guinea a pound!&#x201D;</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Godby has rallied a little but is still in great danger. Gastric fever it is&#x2014;She came home from the country ill, and the first thing she heard was, that her eldest Boy, at the Bluecoat College,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The original Bluecoat School was founded by Edward VI in <date when="1552-00-00">1552</date> at Christ&#x2019;s Hospital, Newgate St., for the education of poor children. By the mid-19th century charity schools all round the country were known as &#x201C;bluecoat schools&#x201D; because of the color of their uniform.</note> was down in Scarlet fever&#x2014;the impossibility of going to nurse him so aggravated her illness that for two days there was no hope!&#x2014; Both her Mother and Brother came on getting the telegraph message and are with her. The Governess<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> wished to send for me, but didn&#x2019;t know my address, the fool! The twins<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Mary and an unidentified twin.</note> are also lying very ill. And I feel ready to stamp with impatience when I think of all that and that I am laid up with Influenza&#x2014;</p>

<p>Your little Bulletin comes duly and is very valuable, poor Dear; I wish I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> cure you on the sudden, Barnes or I; but alas we can do nothing of that miraculous nature, least of all can the latter gent<hi rend="italic">n!</hi> All <hi rend="italic">he</hi> can do is to keep absolutely quiet,&#x2014;and write you a poor scratch of the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Nothing</hi>-News&#x201D; that are passing here! I have slept well; am utterly lazy, stupid; and it is the brightest weather in the world: that is all that can be said or sung.</p>
<p>If I knew accurately that I should not <hi rend="italic">hurt</hi> you by coming, I think I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be disposed to come off on Saturday: but I do not quite know that, and in my present dimness shall probably not do it. Tell me, next opportunity, with all the candour and exactitude you can. I abide hitherto by the &#x201C;All-at-once&#x201D; plan; that is to say, I have not written anything to Alderley (for wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> indolence alone w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be reason enough, indolence and dimness of insight into facts); I feel too a kind of aversion to getting into new fashions and conditions, and even into <hi rend="italic">opening</hi> my trunk (still standing mostly <hi rend="italic">packed</hi> if I can possibly help it.&#x2014; Mary has 12lb of excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> butter ready to salt and send; but there will be no <hi rend="italic">oatmeal</hi> of first quality either here or at Scotsbrig for perhaps 3 weeks yet: will you have them come <hi rend="italic">together?</hi> Or must the butter (or a part of it in my trunk, wh<hi rend="italic">h will</hi> be &#x201C;possible&#x201D; in spite of my indolences) come at once? Speak your mind &#x26; will on this small matter?&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack went off yesterday, along with Jamie;&#x2014;gloomily sorrowful to part with me, poor soul; but obliged to do it, having no lodging of his own in this world, nor prospect of having any,&#x2014;owing to difficulties wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are inexorable and insuperable, tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of pecuniary nature! His kindness, and even rough tenderness to me, on this last Expedit<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> have been almost ominous: he himself too is very sad of heart; I was truly downcast, last night, to see the white-headed old man faring off on such terms, on his unreasonable but inevitable lonesome road.</p>
<p>I hope and begin partly to predict that poor Mrs Godby will get thro&#x2019;: what a deliverance to those about her! Be you quiet, meanwhile, <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> don&#x2019;t stir, at y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> peril!&#x2014;&#x2014; Jean is mending drawers, sewing belts &#x26;c beside me; does not bother with talk, except permitted; and is company on my walk. The inclosed clipping is from her.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> Adieu, <closer><salute>Dearest</salute></closer></p>

<p>I do so hate, Dear, to tell about myself every day!&#x2014;as if I were &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the crops</hi>&#x201D; or something of that sort!</p>
<p>When &#x201C;I&#x2019;se no better, I&#x2019;se ashamed to say it&#x201C;&#x2014;and when I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> better &#x201C;Ise&#x201D; equally ashamed to be cackling over my wellness. and so I shall be glad when you can see with your eyes how I am, instead of my telling you, in words.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I have today to inform you that I am in what poor Hunt called a &#x201C;very Irish state of health&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s saying untraced.</note> &#x201C;Oh! middling!&#x201C;&#x2014; I didn&#x2019;t sleep so well as the previous night&#x2014;and got up with a head ach&#x2014;which is not gone yet. But I have had a good dinner of &#x201C;Sweet-bread&#x201C;&#x2014;and expect a sleep by and by&#x2014;</p>
<p>Dont be afraid that I will go to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Godby. I am not in a condition to be of any use to them and have no notion of going out of my way for the fuss of the thing&#x2014;like Geraldine&#x2014;at present I dont even know when I shall be let <hi rend="italic">go out.</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin went yesterday and brought me a note from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Binnie. The D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> think the poor soul still in great danger&#x2014;but have <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> (they had none at first) of her recovery&#x2014;</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barlow has brought me a pretty gold brooch from Paris&#x2014;and gave it to me as a keepsake &#x201C;in the prospect of his death any day&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x2014; He gets more and more palsied&#x2014;and his mind too is much enfeebled, but the <hi rend="italic">perfect gentleman</hi> still looks pathetically out thro&#x2019; all his infirmities&#x2014;and he will allow none of us to bother&#x2014; He admits if you question him that &#x201C;paralysis is gradually carrying him off,&#x201D; but you are not expected to look more grave for that; and for the rest, he seems as <hi rend="italic">prepared</hi> as the most &#x201C;professing Christian&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Duke of Manchester sent back your books <hi rend="italic">unpaid</hi> (carriage 1&#x2F; 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)&#x2014; I thought it was <hi rend="italic">game&#x2014;</hi>when that money was demanded&#x2014;and was so provoked to see our own books! <closer><salute>God be with you</salute></closer></p>

<p>I am coming home to thee Tomorrow (Saturday) Night, my poor own Goody: that, after ref[l]exion<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> perhaps more than enough, is the solution I have arrived at. I am fairly out of my <hi rend="italic">medicinal</hi> adventure; may fairly call myself a little recovered from my Annandale or Travelling damages; furthermore I am utterly indolent, dreary-lazy, <hi rend="italic">demoralized;&#x2014;</hi>not to say that I ought (in spite of what you say) to be looking after my one little Possession in Chelsea, and seeing with my own eyes how she is:&#x2014;in brief that is the decision; and but for some mistake or other wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I do not anticipate, I <hi rend="italic">swallow</hi> my dirty draughts, at one gulp, and am with you! Nine or 10 in the Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (I <hi rend="italic">think,</hi> but do not know) we are due,&#x2014;perhaps 10&#xBD; at Chelsea? For God&#x2019;s sake make no disturbance about me, Goody dear! I will be quiet as a Dream; I shall need nothing but Tea and two fresh eggs;&#x2014;surely I ought to be rather a protect<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to your poor sick fancy than a new disturbance. Be still, be quiet, poor Goody of my heart; I swear to do thee no mischief at all!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I got safe home on Saturday, and with less discomfort and <hi rend="italic">brashing</hi> than is usual. The D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; Jamie (Senior) appeared suddenly at Carlisle on my arrival, and were very useful while there. I dined (beyond Preston) on a wing of chicken of Mary&#x2019;s carving, who had also filled my bottle with water qualified to the right pitch with brandy: I had the whole carriage mostly to myself, and <pb id="pg-36-262" n="36:262"/>smoked and ventilated quite at discretion. The Country seem[ed] to grow <hi rend="italic">wetter</hi> the farther south we got, till at London it was fairly rain and <hi rend="italic">glar.&#x2014;</hi> Jane looked fully better than I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have hoped; she now gets out for a drive at times; is gone this midday, tho&#x2019; the weather is rawish. I have not yet made out my <hi rend="italic">ten-hours</hi> sleep; but hope to be all round in a few days, and my <hi rend="italic">smithy-fire</hi> (as I expressed it) fairly alight again. Nobody is here to give the least disturbance for a month to come.</p>
  <p>I think Nibloe<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Nibloe (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889-00-00">89</date>), shoemaker, 86 High St., Dumfries.</note> may venture on the woollen slippers, on the leathern too if he like. A <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> more room for the little toes, especially the right one; a <hi rend="italic">ditto</hi> (but only a ditto) <hi rend="italic">less</hi> of width of instep: that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> make the leather ones perfect. For the <hi rend="italic">woollen</hi> he can lean always to the side of room (with &#x215B; inch more length): the <hi rend="italic">woollen</hi> pair, if I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get them right, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very useful. Might be ready with the Gill Butter-and-meal package, if you found the speculat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> safe.</p>
<p>I have written to Scotsbrig: the good Mary bargained for a Newspaper; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have sent. There are some <hi rend="italic">Frasers</hi> here; I will despatch one in a day or two. To James and all the Household my kindest regards and grateful remembrance. May we all meet again some day,&#x2014;as a Gracious Providence has so many times permitted us to do. Amen!</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There are some fiery strokes of satire in your Ballad,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Sutherland Clearance: A Ballad</hi> (Glasgow, <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>) was an attack on the <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">20</date> Sutherland clearances.</note> and the Piece is not difficult to read: but probably the subject is not well adapted for that form of <pb id="pg-36-263" n="36:263"/>treatment. I liked your second <hi rend="italic">Macphail</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ward also pbd., under his pseudonym, a two-part article, &#x201C;On Landed Property and the Clearance System,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">MacPhail&#x2019;s Edinburgh Ecclesiastical Journal</hi> nos. 174 and 175 (Edinburgh, <date when="1860-07-00">July</date> and <date when="1860-08-00">Aug. 1860</date>) 342&#x2013;54 and 23&#x2013;39. In the first part Ward argued: &#x201C;the land in fact is a trust, let out by society, for the general good; and that there is no inherent right to landed property vested in any individual, or family of successive individuals, but what is underlaid by this great social principle&#x201D;; he attacked modern ideas about land improvement, arguing that small farms can be just as productive as large ones (<hi rend="italic">MacPhail</hi> 174:346). The second part was a furious and sustained attack on the apologia of James Loch, <hi rend="italic">An Account of the Improvements on the Estates of the Marquess of Stafford</hi> (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>).

I have sent away one Copy of the Ballad; let it smite upon what hearts it can.</p>

What you say is useful and I bid you in all ways continue to say it wherever there is opportunity. &#x201C;The Earth&#x201D; (of all things) &#x201C;is the Lord&#x2019;s&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Ps. 24:1, quoted by Ward in his article (<hi rend="italic">MacPhail</hi> 174:346).</note> and no other person&#x2019;s, now, then, or at any time! But, alas, I perceive the old Feudal circumstances never can return, nor anything practically like them (however much wanted, and indeed at last <pb id="pg-36-264" n="36:264"/>indispensable)<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ward argued that the feudal system was not only a responsible system of land tenure, but also the best method of producing soldiers.</note> till people have quite laid aside immense quantities of stuff (especially [a]bout &#x201C;liberty&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> they now babble of, with one accord, from Dan to Beersheba,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Kings 4:25.</note> as the true account of man and his blessedness in this world. The pinch of Anarchy will one day check this, in England itself, in Yankee-land itself, if nothing else will. We must wait, we must wait.</p>
<p>I have sometimes tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of asking if you never rode, on an afternoon? I generally have a horse (not quite yet, for a day or two); and there might for once an intersection take place, if things stood well!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ward lived at 12 Chapel St., Mayfair, was 2&#xBC; mi.
