<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I dare not promise anything as to the F. Quarterly at present:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Late in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> Chapman &#x26; Hall acquired the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi> from Black &#x26; Armstrong, and Forster was asked to act as ed. and so seek new contributors. He was to publish TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Dr. Francia,&#x201D; 31 (<date when="1843-07-00">July 1843</date>): 544&#x2013;89.</note> if I get fairly into that Cromwell, I shall have to go on, incessant, as a shot projectile, as a kindled fire, and not stop,&#x2014;under penalty of going out altogether! On the other hand if I do not begin it, if I never get it begun? All that I have written hitherto has gone straight to the fire!&#x2014; I begin to approach the verge of de<supplied>[s]</supplied>peration about this Cromwell enterprise: one way or other a decision must be got at before long, were it only to save my life and sanity.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote, [early <date when="1842-01-00">Jan.</date>]: &#x201C;A mere sketcher shifts hither and thither round a view to catch some picturesque glimpse of it: on all sides I try C<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, but he is dull blank on all sides; only within him lies a great meaning, the meaning of a great man in the world&#x2019;s history: alas, how to extract that? Here is cloud enough; but the Lightning where?&#x2014; All cloud has lightning in it (electric virtue in it) were there a means of bringing it out!&#x201D; (Forster MS 95r.).</note> We shall then see.</p>
<p>I have had nothing to do with foreign Literature for a number of years past. Zelter&#x2019;s correspondence with Goethe, an excellent Book now in hand, is the only one I have meddled with lately.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411218-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1841-12-18">18 Dec. 1841</date></ref>.</note> German Literature in these new days seems all to have run to threads and thrums. The French Literature of G. Sand and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, which many people told me was a new-birth, I found to be a detestable putrefaction,&#x2014;new-life of nothing but maggots and blue-bottles.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your Cary, which I wanted to see.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Cary, <hi rend="italic">Memorials of the Great Civil War in England, from <date when="1646-00-00">1646</date> to <date when="1652-00-00">1652</date>. Edited from Original Letters in the Bodleian Library</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>). Forster&#x2019;s copy has TC&#x2019;s pencil notes.</note> I am at Cromwell again (<foreign><hi rend="italic">sub ros&#xe2;</hi></foreign>) this day: but, alas, it too will go to the fire!</p>
<p>Speed to you in the thing you work on. It has been a real pleasure to see you visibly growing in all kinds of strength and clearness of late years. &#x201C;By working late and early,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;By working late and early / We&#x2019;re come to what ye see, / Although we made our bridal bed / On clean pease <foreign>strae</foreign> [straw]&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note, Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 1:331).</note> as the old Song says, there is much <pb id="pg-14-4" n="14:4"/>possible.

<p>I think I had once the pleasure of seeing you here. It strikes me I may as well apply to you as to another for advice and response as to a certain Literary Project that is sometimes in my head lately,&#x2014;as yet in a very vague state.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably his work on <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>A happy new-year to you also;&#x2014;and thanks withal for your many kindnesses to me! I am not worthy of you; yet I have you. Let us be thankful, let us be hopeful, and stand tightly to our work. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi</hi></foreign>, I wonder how people can ring bells at this season: I could rather chaunt Litanies; or go, like the Chinese, to &#x201C;the grave of my Fathers,&#x201D; and sit <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> there. God is great, and man is little and mean, and a fool! <hi rend="italic">Coeur-de-lion</hi> shall be deposited duly where you have bidden.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Sterling&#x2019;s unfinished poem, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411226-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1841-12-26">26 Dec. 1841</date></ref>.</note> Cardalion,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s joke name for Coeur de Lion.</note>&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">O tempora, O mores</hi></foreign>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;O what times, O what habits&#x201D;: Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Orationes in Catilinam</hi> 1.1.1.</note>&#x2014;is a hero of Shakspeare&#x2019;s Parson Hughes!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Hugh Evans, in <hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi>.</note></p>
<p>The Westminster-Review Article &#x201C;on the Corn-Laws&#x201D; is but a Newspaper puff;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Industry and Its Reward,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> 37 (<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>):216&#x2013;26, signed O., unidentified, a review of the <hi rend="italic">Seventh Annual Report of the Poor Law Commissioners</hi>, Robert Owen, <hi rend="italic">The New Moral World, The Anti-Socialist Gazette</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Working Classes</hi>.</note> which may the Devil reward. I did write a very insignificant Article, and publish it in that carrion of a Review; but it is an Article on Baillie the Scotch Covernanter&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals</hi>, and has nothing to do with any Corn-Laws; one paragraph only the wretched Editor I suppose has clipt out, and sent circulating thro&#x2019; the Newspapers. After all, be it so! I do not know but the <hi rend="italic">Divine Right of Squires</hi> may actually come to require treatment by me;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;They had the <hi rend="italic">Divine Right of Kings</hi> to settle, those unfortunate ancestors of ours. &#x2026; Alas, we, their children, have got perhaps a still harder thing to settle: the <hi rend="italic">Divine Right of Squires</hi>&#x201D; (&#x201C;Baillie the Covenanter,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:258&#x2013;59).</note> it is one of the most <pb id="pg-14-6" n="14:6"/>portentous and momentous questions struggling into articulation in these days.</p>
<p>The Article has nothing in it to attract you, except perhaps an Extract about <hi rend="italic">Strafford&#x2019;s Trial</hi>, which is really notable; which I meant to tell you of, ever since the Book came into my hands, three months ago: nay for longer ago than that; for I have known the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> edition of the Book this great while; but I always hesitated to mention it to you, lest the impossibility of getting it (for such there was) might only vex you. David Laing of Edinburgh, the new Editor, is a skilful man, and has more than once obliged me. I wrote this Article partly for his sake, partly to bring my own hand in.&#x2014; If you now think <hi rend="italic">Baillie</hi> worth carrying to Falmouth, I can right willingly set him under way; the Book is my own, and I have no immediate need of it. Would to Heaven I had!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Does John Mill ever write to you? It is something like four months since I last saw him, and then in his own house one evening,&#x2014;very busy with a Book on Logic.</p>
<p>This paper is made of <hi rend="italic">plaster of Paris;</hi> wherefore I am forced to write on it with a steel pen; altogether afflicting to me. <hi rend="italic">Sit finis</hi><foreign/> [Let there be an end].</p>
<p>May this year be better for us than the last was. May <hi rend="italic">we</hi> shew ourselves better; truer, braver, humbler: that is the right good!</p>
<p>My Wife, stepping in at this moment, sends you many kind salutations. <closer><salute>Good be with you always, my dear Friend.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Yours affectionately /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>I have got an admirable Portrait of Milton by Cooper; far the best face of him ever drawn. Molteno sells it in Pall Mall for 5/- Sir J. Reynolds got it engraved about 50 years ago, and successfully defended its authenticity.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Cooper (<date when="1600-00-00">1600</date>&#x2013;<date when="1672-00-00">1672</date>), miniature painter; J. A. Molteno, print-seller, 20 Pall Mall; Sir Joshua Reynolds (<date when="1723-00-00">1723</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792-00-00">92</date>), portrait painter. It is no longer considered authentic: &#x201C;allegedly painted by Samuel Cooper in <date when="1653-00-00">1653</date>, &#x2026; much copied and reproduced &#x2026; since <date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>, when it belonged to Sir Joshua Reynolds and was engraved by Caroline Watson. &#x2026; [T]he story told about its history is both suspicious and demonstrably wrong in details&#x201D; (W. R. Parker, <hi rend="italic">Milton: A Biography</hi> [Oxford, <date when="1968-00-00">1968</date>] 2:1014). In the Forster MS f.104r. [ca. <date when="1841-12-20">20 Dec.</date>], TC notes: &#x201C;Examined too the Controversy about Milton&#x2019;s Reynolds-Cooper Portrait; the disputants L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Hailes and Sir Joshua, Gentleman&#x2019;s Magazine for <date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>. &#x2026; Hailes&#x2019;s objections seemed to be rather trivial; and all was tolerably well explained by Sir Joshua, in a rather high proud key. &#x2026;&#x2014; To me the portrait seems the best,&#x2014;and there is at least nothing to hinder one&#x2019;s believing it to be true.&#x201D;</note></p></ps>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Mother</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>You have been wandering so about of late times, and there has been such confused trouble going on, that I have not got you regularly written to. It seems to me a long while since we had any right communication together. To-day I will scribble you a word before going out. Alick says you are for moving over to Gill again to bear Jenny company till the day lengthens. If you be already gone they will send this after you.</p>
<p>The great trouble there has been at Scotsbrig<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The illness and death of James and Isabella&#x2019;s three-year-old son Tom.</note> must have been distressing to every person there, from the poor father and mother downwards. You, in particular, could not escape. The weather also is sorely inclement and not wholesome for those that cannot take violent exercise; yet Alick assures me you are &#x201C;as well as usual.&#x201D; Nay, he adds that you mean soon to write to me. I pray you take care, dear Mother, in your shifting to the Gill and during your stay there in the stranger house; it is bitter weather and looks as if it would continue long frosty. Tell me especially how you are, what clothes you wear, whether you get good fires. A warm bottle is indispensable in the bed at night. You have books to read, daily little bits of work to do; you must crouch quiet till the sun comes out again.</p>
<p>A considerable noise has been going on about that little Review-Article of mine which I sent you. The last page <hi rend="italic">of the Divine Right of Squires</hi> has been circulating widely through the Newspapers with various commentary and so forth. This I by no means grudge: as the thing is true, it may circulate as widely as it likes. It can do nothing but <hi rend="italic">good</hi> (whether pleasant or painful <hi rend="italic">good</hi>) being <hi rend="italic">true</hi>,&#x2014;let it circulate where it will. If a word of mine can help to relieve the world from an insupportable oppression, surely it shall be very welcome to do so! The man<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the ed., William Hickson.</note> has paid me for this &#x201C;article&#x201D; (&#xa3;24) but I think I shall not soon trouble the world again with reviewing. I mean something <hi rend="italic">else</hi> than that if I could get at it. On the whole, what with Edinburgh Professorships, what with <hi rend="italic">Covenanter</hi> Articles, we have had rather a noisy time of it in the newspapers for a while back. It is not unpleasant, but except for aiding the sale of one&#x2019;s books, perhaps it is apt to be unprofitable. Fame? Reputation? &#x26;c, as old Tom White<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified. His saying was coterie speech.</note> said <pb id="pg-14-8" n="14:8"/>of the whisky, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Keep</hi> your whisky to yoursel&#x2019;! deevil o&#x2019; ever I&#x2019;se better than when there&#x2019;s no a drop on&#x2019;t i&#x2019; my <foreign>wame</foreign> [belly]?&#x201D; which is a literal <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>,&#x2014;both as to fame and whisky.</p>
<p>My new book, I may tell you now, is to be something about that same <hi rend="italic">Civil War in England</hi> which Baillie was in the midst of; I think mainly or almost exclusively about <hi rend="italic">Oliver Cromwell</hi>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is important to note that TC was undecided what kind of book he was to write except that it was to be something connected with Cromwell. Probably in <date when="1842-01-00">Jan</date> he wrote in the Forster MS drafts, 93r., a page headed &#x201C;Studies in Oliver Cromwell,&#x201D; ending his first para.: &#x201C;(This will never do&#x2014; Keep all that philosophy to one&#x2019;s self!)&#x201D; On 95r. [<date when="1842-01-00">Jan.</date>] a short series of entries shows even more indecision: &#x201C;Oliver Cromwell the last (King) <foreign><hi rend="italic">K&#xF6;nning</hi></foreign> of England, may, now at this date when there is prospect of either other kings or even of national destruction, be a figure worth dwelling on (Ah, Ah!)&#x2014; / &#x2018;Commentaries on Oliver Cromwell; Studies on O.C.&#x2019; or what?&#x2014; / In Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine for <date when="1841-12-00">Dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1841</date> is a notice that O. used to sit beside his daughter Claypole&#x2019;s harpsichord while she was playing, and would &#x2018;burst into tears&#x2019;: where did the writer get that fact? (Ask).&#x201D;</note> I am struggling sore to get some hold of it, but the business will be dreadfully difficult, far worse than any <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>, if I am to do it <hi rend="italic">right:</hi>&#x2014;and if I do not do it <hi rend="italic">right</hi> what is the use of doing it at all? For some time I tried actual writing at it lately, but found it was too <hi rend="italic">soon</hi> yet. I must wrestle and tumble about with it, indeed at bottom I do not know yet whether <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> I shall be able to make a Book out of it! All that I can do is to <hi rend="italic">try</hi>, till I ascertain either Yes or No. For the rest I am grown too old and cunning now to plunge right on and attempt conquering the thing by sheer <hi rend="italic">force</hi>. I lie back, <foreign><hi rend="italic">canny, canny</hi></foreign>, and whenever I find my sleep beginning to suffer, I lay down the tools for a while.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster MS 95v. dates an entry, ending: &#x201C;&#x2018;Honour the Able-man; and for this end (first of all) know him, know when to seek for him.&#x2019;) (Last night, <date when="1842-01-07">7 jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1842</date>, at H.

Waste none of it in base murmuring, at least!)&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> By Heaven&#x2019;s great blessing I am not now urged on by direct need of money. We have arranged ourselves here in what to London people is an inconceivable state of <hi rend="italic">thrift</hi>, and in our small way are not now tormented with any fear of want whatever, for the present.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Later in the month the situation changed; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420207-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1842-02-07">7 Feb.</date></ref></note> To myself my poverty is really quite a suitable, almost comfortable, arrangement. I often think what should I do if I <hi rend="italic">were</hi> wealthy! I am perhaps among the freest men in the British Empire at this moment. No King or Pontiff has any power over me, gets any revenue from me, except what he may <hi rend="italic">deserve</hi> at my hands. There is nothing but my Maker whom I call Master under this sky. What would I be at? George Fox was hardly <pb id="pg-14-9" n="14:9"/>freer in his <hi rend="italic">suit of leather</hi> than I here:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Fox (<date when="1624-00-00">1624</date>&#x2013;<date when="1691-00-00">91</date>), founder of the Society of Friends (Quakers); see Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 209&#x2013;12.</note> if to be sure not carrying it quite so far as the <hi rend="italic">leather</hi>. Jane, too, is quite of my way of thinking in this respect. Truly we have been mercifully dealt with, and much that looked like evil has turned to be good. One thing I must tell you as a small adventure which befell, the day before yesterday. On going out for walking along one of these streets an elderly, innocent, intelligent-looking gentleman accosted me with &#x201C;Apologies for introducing himself to Mr. Carlyle whose works &#x26;c, &#x26;c. He was <hi rend="italic">the Parish clergyman</hi>,&#x201D; rector of the Parish of St. Luke&#x2019;s, Chelsea!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. Charles Kingsley (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), the incumbent, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">60</date>; father of the author (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">75</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59874"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) of the same name.</note> I replied of course with all civility to the worthy man (though shocked to admit that after seven years of parishionership I did not know the face of him). We walked together as far as our roads would coincide, then parted with low bows. I mean to ask about the man (whose <hi rend="italic">name</hi> I do not even know yet!) and, if the accounts be good, to invite a nearer approximation.</p>
<p>Jack will be with us to-morrow evening, we expect; oftenest we see him only that once in the course of a week. He is healthy, cheery and as full of talk and activity as I ever saw him. His Patient and he walk daily, or drive, or ride several hours, which is a good encourager of health. He seems likelier than ever to stay a good while in this present situation, to realize a good purse perhaps,&#x2014;and then retire as a half-pay. Jane sticks close in the house ever since the frost began, for near a week now; she is in very tolerable health. Poor Helen, our servant, heard the other night of the death of a poor sick (asthmatic) sister at Edinburgh, which grieved her to the ground for a while and still greatly afflicts her; we are sorry for the poor creature.</p>
<p>Alick&#x2019;s long letter, you can tell him, shall be answered by and by. I had also a letter from Jean not many days ago. I have extremely little time for writing letters. You must all be patient with me. Commend me to poor Isabella, whose affliction we deeply sympathize with. <closer><salute>Yours affectionately.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>If you have yet got any certain intelligence about poor Charles Scott, may I claim of you to let me share in it. If not yet, then so soon as any does arrive. I have the liveliest impression of that good honest Scotch face and character, tho&#x2019; never in contact with the young man but that once.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles (b. <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>), the youngest of Sir Walter&#x2019;s four children, d. of fever, <date when="1841-10-00">Oct. 1841</date>, in Teheran, where he was attach&#xE9; at the British embassy. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1841-12-27">27 Dec. 1841</date>, quoting the <hi rend="italic">Leeds Mercury</hi>, noted: &#x201C;He was carefully educated at Oxford, but from his unobtrusive manner and retired habits was little known, and made no exertion beyond his official duties.&#x201D; TC probably met him through Lockhart, his brother-in-law.</note> Alas, so many histories are tragedies; or rather, all histories are! I pray you, let me know.</p>
<p>That is a capital Article on the Copyright Question:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Copyright Question,&#x201D; by Lockhart as TC guessed, <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> 69 (<date when="1841-12-00">Dec. 1841</date>):186&#x2013;227.

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">Strafford</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The MS of <hi rend="italic">Strafford: A Tragedy</hi>, pbd. <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>.</note> has arrived: I announce this fact, because both the Packets had given way at the end, the too weak paper having burst; <pb id="pg-14-11" n="14:11"/>and your <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> ran a great risk of being scattered out into the general mailbag, and tragically lost!&#x2014; I will send it so soon as I can command the smallest leisure for the purpose. My vote too you shall have <foreign><hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi></foreign> [one way or the other]; vote of the greatest enemy &#x201C;the legitimate drama&#x201D; now has.</p>
<p>Poor Calvert&#x2019;s death, which I had not heard of before, is heavy news to me:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. John Mitchinson Calvert d. <date when="1842-01-09">9 Jan.</date>, age 40; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380825-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>10:148</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1838-08-25">25 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>, where named Mitchison incorrectly. TC speaks fondly of him in his life of Sterling, and says: &#x201C;To me he left a curious old Print of James Nayler [<date when="1617-00-00">1617</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1660-00-00">60</date>] the Quaker, which I still affectionately preserve&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:221).</note> An innocent sincere soul, macerated in sore sufferings, we hope purified in them, is gone to its long rest.</p>
<p>My studies in the <hi rend="italic">Civil War</hi> threaten to be bottomless. The character of O. Cr<hi rend="italic">l</hi> comes before me clearer and clearer, as of a great man, almost of a kind of god: but the means of representing it? There is the rub. It lies buried under two centuries of quackeries, scepticisms, owleries,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> resuscitable; unless you could tear up the roots of the actual British world along with it! Besides I am in very poor health of body: how can I take such a thing in my arms, and rend the secret out of it? I have an unhappy talent for fixing on the impossible!</p> 
<p>In the last <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi> you will read a very wholesome sermon by H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Taylor, with Wordsworth&#x2019;s sonnets for text.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Taylor, review of <hi rend="italic">The Sonnets of William Wordsworth Collected in One Volume</hi> (<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), 69 (<date when="1841-12-00">Dec. 1841</date>):1&#x2013;51.</note> The Sermon is good; a real Sermon: but the inspired volume of Sonnets&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott!</hi></foreign>&#x2014; I have also read Rich<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Milnes&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">One Tract More</hi>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410719-TC-RMM-01">TC to RMM, <date when="1841-07-19">19 July 1841</date></ref>.</note> We do live in bewildered, benighted, ghost-ridden times.</p>

<p>It gives me great pleasure to understand that you mean to do a pious duty to Knox.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laing was to publish vol. 1 of <hi rend="italic">The Works of John Knox</hi> in <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>, which (in 6 vols.) was his most important work.</note> Surely such a thing is wanted; it is a disgrace to us not to have such a thing. I would recommend a complete chronological collection, with diligent not too abundant commentary,&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">modern spelling</hi>. When you come hither I shall be very glad to see you.</p>
<p>The passage of <hi rend="italic">AEneas Sylvius</hi> was at once discovered by your indication; unluckily I found almost nothing there except what Camden had already given me.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Aeneas Sylvius, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411120-TC-DL-01">TC to DL, <date when="1841-11-20">20 Nov. 1841</date></ref>; for William Camden, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411202-TC-RMM-01">TC to RMM, <date when="1841-12-02">2 Dec. 1841</date></ref>. TC notes (Forster MS, f.104): &#x201C;&#x2014;I read Aeneas Sylvius (one day at the Brit. Mus.) all of it that has any value is in Camden. Aeneas (Piccolomini his name too is) records in the most vague manner, by way of far off reminiscence, in the Book called his <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi>, Frankfurt <date when="1614-00-00">1614</date> (p. 4 &#x26; 5), that the Scots dig up a sulphurous stone and burn it; that even <hi rend="italic">villas</hi> are covered with thatch, that the common houses have an oxhide for door; that the women are <foreign><hi rend="italic">renustae</hi></foreign>, fond of flirting, and regard a kiss no more than Italians do a shake of the hand (perhaps too some obscure transient allusions to their trade with the Netherlands; then directly follows the account of his personal adventure given in Camden). I cannot consider <hi rend="italic">what</hi> &#x2018;great village&#x2019; that was where he lodged. The scene of the thing appears probably enough to be the Solway. Did he get his rundlet of wine and stock of white bread at Sweetheart Abbey? &#x2018;At a certain Abbey,&#x2019; on the Scotch side.&#x2014; What a pity men did not use their eyes! I remember Petrarch&#x2019;s view of women washing in the Rhine, too. Aeneas was about <date when="1450-00-00">1450</date>.&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x201D; Nine lines later TC dates his comment: &#x201C;What an awful life of &#x2018;strenuous idleness&#x2019; I at present lead. No moment resting; yet making no perceptible way in any direction whatsoever. It is near one o&#x2019;clock today (<date when="1841-12-20">Monday, 20 Dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>) before I have got my hand put to any work. I tumbled about, awoke in the night &#x26;c., it was ten o&#x2019;clock before I woke. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ainsi va-t-il</hi></foreign> [Thus it goes].&#x2014; <foreign>Canaille!</foreign> But not to loiter, longer.&#x201D;</note> I cannot at all make out what &#x201C;large <pb id="pg-14-14" n="14:14"/>village&#x201D; (on the Cumberland Coast, for I judge he speaks of the Solway Firth) the worthy Legate had been lodging in: his &#x201C;rundlet of wine and stock of bread&#x201D; he might have got about Sweetheart Abbey:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >New Abbey, Kirkcudbrightshire, SW Scotland, often called Sweetheart Abbey (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Cor Dulce</hi></foreign>) after its foundress Devorgilla, the widow of John Baliol, who was buried in the Cistercian abbey holding a casket containing her husband&#x2019;s heart.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The decision you so earnestly expect ought at least to be sent you soon;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stirling had renewed his writing to TC in a letter not found but referred to in Stirling, <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 53&#x2013;54, where its publication is said to have been forbidden by the author. But we are told that it was of a &#x201C;personal nature,&#x201D; accompanied by some of his early writings, enthusiastic, unreserved, seeking guidance, and that it was highly idealistic.</note> unfortunately it is all the kindness I can shew you at present.</p>
<p>I have read the whole of your Prose Manuscript: if you knew what an element one lives in here, this of itself might be proof that you are worth something to me! The Poetic Manuscript I have not read in whole, but only parts; such part, as seemed sufficient for grounding a practical conclusion on; and this I now in great haste proceed to transmit you.</p>
<p>It appears to me clearly altogether improbable that any Bookseller, in these times of the Book-trade, would so much as consent to publish your <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> at his own cost; far less pay down any sum of money for it. Nay I am not at all sure, harsh as this may seem, that it were for your own real good to have it published, to have it what is even called &#x201C;succeed.&#x201D; There is undoubtedly sign of talent in it; but talent in far too loose, crude and unformed a condition: to have <hi rend="italic">such</hi> accounted real finished talent, and praised and preached abroad, is precisely <pb id="pg-14-15" n="14:15"/>the fatallest future for a youth of any merit;&#x2014;the sweetness in the mouth which in the belly becomes bitter as gall! You will understand all that better, I hope, some ten years hence; and twenty years hence, better still. But, on the whole, however that may be, I hesitate not to pronounce your Poem entirely unworkable as a financial element, in this place, at this time; and advise you not to spend more effort in that direction, but to quit it altogether for some more promising one. I at least, who know hardly any Bookseller, and have indeed small sympathy with their trade and aims at present, must profess my inability to make any helpful use of this <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. I will, if you still request it, submit the Paper to the Publisher of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, the only Bookseller I speak to once in six months: but I must say beforehand that I think he has no chance to accept it. This is my sincere verdict. A much politer and softer to the ear might easily have been written; but my words are to do you good if they can; and a deeper feeling of regard orders me to avoid all flattering unctions in your case.</p>
<p>You seem to me a young man to whom Nature has given a superior endowment, which you run a considerable risk of <hi rend="italic">failing</hi> to unfold. Alas, it is so easy to fail! You have in you that generous warmth of heart, which is usually, if it be well guided, the mother-soil of all sorts of talent; but which also, if ill guided, can run up into miserablest waste and weeds. Your mind is opening in many directions, great ideas or prophecies of ideas announcing themselves to you; all this is well, and the best. But, as I can discern withal, all this must as yet be kept in, held down with iron vigour, till it fashion and articulate itself: the cruellest waste for it were to dig it all out at present as germinating seed, to let it all rush up as worthless spurry and chickweed. My dear young friend, you must learn the indispensable significance of hard stern long-continued <hi rend="italic">labour</hi>. Grudge not labour, grudge not pain, disappointment, sorrow or distress of any kind: all is for your good, if we can endeavour and endure. If you cannot,&#x2014;why then it is all hopeless; no man ever grew to anything who durst not look death itself in the face, and say to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> kinds of Martyrdom, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Ye</hi> shall not subdue me!&#x201D; Be of courage; a man lies in you: but a man is not born the second time, any more than the first, without travail.&#x2014; Your desultory mode of study hitherto has probably been a great misfortune; a thing to be pitied, as I well know, and to be blamed, as times now go: but it is a thing you must correct and get the better of. I fancy I discover in you, indeed, a certain natural tendency to haste, crudity, semi-articulate diffusion; I earnestly entreat you, stand up against that, unmercifully as against your worst foe! It will never do. The world wants alcohol, not <foreign>beerwort</foreign> [unfermented beer]. It is a crime to produce the latter, if the former <pb id="pg-14-16" n="14:16"/>be in you. You must learn the meaning of <hi rend="italic">Silence,</hi>&#x2014;that forgotten knowledge of Silence I am always speaking of! Be in no haste to speak yourself. Why be <hi rend="italic">porous</hi>, incontinent? Nothing can ferment itself to clearness in a <hi rend="italic">colander</hi>. Pray that you may be <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> to hold your tongue: the longer you keep silence, the richer will your speech be when it does come.</p> 
<p>Practically my advice were very decidedly that you <hi rend="italic">kept</hi> by medicine; that you resolved faithfully to learn it, on all sides of it, and make yourself in actual fact an &#x1F38;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x1F78;&#x03CC;, a man that <hi rend="italic">could heal disease</hi>. I am very serious in this. Pecuniary means will occasion difficulty;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stirling notes here in <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s Counsels</hi>, &#x201C;There was no such difficulty in reality.&#x201D;</note> but they need not prove insuperable if you bestir yourself. If a man bestir himself, what thing <hi rend="italic">is</hi> insuperable? Your present wishes, tastes &#x26;c ought to go for little with you. A man who cannot gird himself into harness will take no weight along these highways! I would even advise that you resolutely postponed, into the unexplored uncertainty of the Future, all concern with Literature, determined to set no store by that, to let it come or stay away as it might chance to like. As a trade I will protest against your meddling with it; describe it as the frightfullest, fatallest and too generally despicablest of all trades now followed under the sun. He that can, Mithridates-like,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mithridates VI (ca. <date>131</date>&#x2013;<date>63 B.C.</date>), king of Pontus, said to have made himself proof against poisons by constantly taking them in small amounts.</note> make poison his aliment, let him live in it, and conquer (by <hi rend="italic">suffering</hi>, first of all); let no other try it. A steady course of professional industry has ever been held the usefullest support for <hi rend="italic">mind</hi> as well as body: I heartily agree with that. As often I have said, What profession is the equal in true nobleness to Medicine? He that can abolish pain, relieve his fellow mortal from sickness, he is the indisputably usefullest of all men. Him savage and civilized will honour. He is in the right, be in the wrong who may. As a Lord Chancellor, under one&#x2019;s horsehair wig there might be misgivings; still more perhaps as a Lord Primate under one&#x2019;s cauliflower: but if I could heal disease, I should say to all men and angels without fear, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eu, Ecce</hi></foreign> [Look, well done]!</p>
<p>If Literature do unfold itself at length under shelter of such a profession then let Literature be welcome; it will be safe, beneficial, and have a chance to be true and wise, in such circumstances. How many true Physicians have turned out to be true Speakers, or even Singers! A man <hi rend="italic">can</hi> first speak when he has got to <hi rend="italic">know</hi> something; and knowledge comes from Experience alone. My decided advice is, that you stand resolutely by Medicine, determine to find an honest livelihood <pb id="pg-14-17" n="14:17"/>by Medicine, and do a man&#x2019;s task in that way.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stirling became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh in <date when="1842-07-00">July</date>, then practiced in Wales, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">51</date>, when his father d. and he was financially able to leave medicine for philosophy.</note> There is then a solid <hi rend="italic">backbone</hi> in one&#x2019;s existence, round which all manner of beautiful and wholesome things will grow.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And so farewell for the present; and a good genius guide you,&#x2014;a good patient valiant heart which is the best of all geniuses! I have not time to write another word.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Yours with many good wishes /</salute></closer>

<salute>My dear friend</salute>
<p>I find myself engaged to write you a sort of business-letter, a thing which lies one would say, rather out of my sphere&#x2014;but as I have not troubled you with many letters of late, you need not quarrel with the present; tho&#x2019; on a subject as uncongenial to my tastes and habits, as it can possibly be to yours M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x201C;Hurdy-Gurdy&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>There is alive at present in God&#x2019;s Universe, and likely to live, a man&#x2014;Forster by name&#x2014;a barrister without practice&#x2014;residing at No 58 Lincolns Inn fields&#x2014;not unknown to Fame, as &#x201C;the second worst critic of the age&#x201D;; who has gained himself a tolerable footing in our house and hearts, by I cannot precisely say what merits&#x2014; He is one of those people who go about, that one likes, in moderation, without feeling them to be worth the pains of a particular study. Latterly, Carlyle has not thought him &#x201C;so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> bad a critic&#x201D;; for he finds him here and there taking up a notion of his own&#x2014;&#x201C;as if he understood it&#x201D;&#x2014;for my part I have always thought rather well of his judgement&#x2014;for from the first he has displayed a most remarkable clearsightedness with respect to myself&#x2014;thinking me little short of being as great a genius as my husband<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;This Letter, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, I did not know of before, must have produced the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review Article</hi> &#x2018;Characteristics of German Genius,&#x2019; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> occupies pp. 383&#x2013;422 in vol. 1 of Hare&#x2019;s Book [Sterling&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Essays and Tales</hi>, ed.

Meanwhile of course they are to be handsomely <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> for their pains.</p>
<p>Now in casting our eyes about for men of genius&#x2014;fit to infuse new life into dead matter there naturally slid over my lips <hi rend="italic">your</hi> name &#x201C;John Sterling if the Review could but be helped by a fifty page article in rhyme&#x201D;! &#x201C;Why not in <hi rend="italic">prose?</hi>&#x201D; said Forster. &#x201C;Ah! that is another question! to persuade <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to write prose would not be so easy&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;At all events cried Forster with a burst of enthusiasm he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> and <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> and <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be applied to&#x201D;&#x2014; And accordingly he took your address for that purpose. Having consulted with the publishers for whom he is acting gratuitously as Prime Minister, for the mere love of <hi rend="italic">humanity</hi> and his own inward glory; he finds that it were the most promising way of setting about the thing to apply to you through some personal friend&#x2014;and does <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the honour of taking me for such&#x2014;in which I hope he is not mistaken.</p>
<p>Today I have a letter from him from which I extract the most important paragraph (most important for the business in hand that is&#x2014;for it contains besides an invitation to dinner with bright schemes of going to the play)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Will you propose the article on Dante to Mazzini&#x2014;and I want <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi> to write and ask <hi rend="small-caps">john</hi> Sterling&#x201D; (indication of celebrity) &#x201C;to write an article for the next Foreign Quarterly: placing <hi rend="italic">no</hi> restraint on his opinions in any way.

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Accept a brief, and I doubt you will think, very crabbed verdict about <hi rend="italic">Strafford</hi>, from one who loves you, and unwillingly shews you the contradictory points he has. A <hi rend="italic">verdict</hi>, means a <hi rend="small-caps"><foreign>vere-dictum</foreign></hi> [true saying]; the <foreign><hi rend="italic">vere</hi></foreign> is all that can be required of it, and the rest a thing you yourself will easily manage.</p>
<p>I have read this <hi rend="italic">Strafford</hi> without difficulty; a fact which to you, who know my impatience of manuscript, will already mean something. Indeed throughout there is so much of gracefulness, ingen<supplied>[u]</supplied>ity,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> and <hi rend="italic">un</hi>hideable Sterlingism that were the Piece once well <hi rend="italic">printed</hi>, clear <pb id="pg-14-21" n="14:21"/>and handsome to the eye, I should think most persons of taste and faculty would vote that it might be <hi rend="italic">read</hi> without great trouble! But this is not all you want,&#x2014;very far from it; and this unfortunately is almost all that I can say.</p>
<p>My judgement about the Drama generally, I am conscious, must be worth little to Dramatic Writers; for actually, always in glancing into the business, with any eye to practice, it has seemed to me as if the Drama in these times were about <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi>. Even Shakspeare, when I have gone to see him at Covent Garden, admits, to my huge sorrow, that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has become as good as undramatic for me; that he is only in parts alive, and in other parts dead, dead,&#x2014;a most sorrowful combination! My voice therefore need not go for more with you than it is worth. If I vote that it seems to me very questionable indeed to print this <hi rend="italic">Strafford</hi>, and impossible to act it, you can let me vote.</p>
<p>In fact I may say I like this worse than an y of your Poems; that is to say, it is more repulsive to me to accept this, with its aims and its result, as a fair emblem of Sterling&#x2019;s talent;&#x2014;and in fact, whatever others do, I for one will not!</p>
<p>There is surely far too little action in the Play; far too little probability in it; far too&#x2014;in short, why should I go on? It is not a credible image of Strafford and his Environment; neither directly nor emblematically can I find it nearly <hi rend="italic">true enough</hi> for Sterling to have written! Of <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;legitimate drammars&#x201D;</hi> and such like I say nothing; but this is Sterling&#x2019;s emblematic image of Strafford and the breaking out of the Puritan Wars; and as such I have infinite objections to sustain it. Above nine-tenths of the work seem to me fairly unworthy of the workman. The representation of the man and of the things is not interesting; nor is it in any sense conformable to the <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>. I find little that contents me if it be not, in some measure, the burlesque passages, and certain detached speeches,&#x2014;most of all, that fair Carlisle&#x2019;s valediction to the poor King Charles,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Act 5, where Lady Carlisle (<date when="1599-00-00">1599</date>&#x2013;<date when="1660-00-00">1660</date>), in love with Strafford, curses Charles I for his betrayal.</note> which almost alone of the whole Play got into some proximity with this hard heart of mine. In fact there is something very good in the character of this Distinguished Female; Strafford too has his emphasis, his force,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I cannot find him to be <hi rend="italic">true:</hi> but in the rest of the characters I find, alas, little but disappointment. They are untrue to History; but in fact they are not painted at all,&#x2014;at least, not by action which is the only dramatic way of painting.&#x2014; In a word, my dear Sterling, I <hi rend="italic">do not like this Strafford;</hi> verily not; and this, I suppose, is all you were wanting to know of me, all that it can be suitable for me to say at present.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-22" n="14:22"/>I continually pray to Heaven (in a secret way) that you would return to honest <hi rend="italic">Prose</hi>, in which as <supplied>[I]</supplied> do very seriously believe you are ten times more <hi rend="italic">poetical</hi> than in that singing without any tune, to an audience without ear, you will ever make yourself! And yet not my will, but thy will be done.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; <closer><salute>And so God help us all, for we have a horrible time of it</salute></closer></p>

<p>These verses (of Gay&#x2019;s) are very good, write them who might,&#x2014;superlatively good for an Opera; and if the music, as there is good likelihood, correspond to them, and be fairly given, I will augur a fortunate result.</p>

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Your Letter does you infinite honour, and me far too much. It is rare indeed to see a man capable of balancing himself between two such noble antagonisms; animated by such a wish to please, and such a patience in not pleasing. Courage! Such a spirit conquers many difficulties; conquers all difficulties, if it can endure. I said to myself: &#x201C;Such a Letter is worth half a dozen of the best Dramas going,&#x2014;and does point towards good Dramas in the distance yet, or else still better things.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I also entirely respect your persistance in your own firm purpose in spite of all cavils of mine: what else can you persist in? The inward voice, if it be an <hi rend="italic">in</hi>ward one, and not some false echo of mere <hi rend="italic">outer</hi> ones, is the prophetic voice of our whole soul and world, saying to us, &#x201C;There, in such a world, that is the thing that <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> canst do!&#x201D; All voices from without, and counter-monitions of other men, how prudent and well-meant soever, are in the end but impertinences in comparison. A man has to go, often enough, right in the teeth of all that; all that, often enough, is as the Gates of Gaza, which a right Sampson, duly surveying the strength of them, and well considering himself, has to walk off with, and carry away on his shoulders. Alas, we are sore hemmed-in, all of us, and dwell imprisoned as in Polyphemus caverns, in <hi rend="italic">cases</hi> of triple brass,&#x2014;which we have to break, or perish in trying to break!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Judg. 16:3. In the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>, bk. 9, Polyphemus imprisons Ulysses and his men in a cave. TC has in mind the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Aes Triplex</hi></foreign> of Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> 1.3.9; cf. &#x201C;triple steel,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 2:569.</note></p>
<p>Let me add moreover, in reference to <hi rend="italic">Strafford</hi>, that it is at least actually my <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> word you now have; that having once expectorated my dissatisfaction with the general outcome, the worth and even excellence of many of the details become clearer to me. It was very evident to me that you had bestowed much pains on the work, much previous reading, much diligent manipulation in all kinds. What I wished was, at bottom in summary this: That you had bestowed still more! It is perhaps <pb id="pg-14-24" n="14:24"/>the highest feat a man can attempt, the writing of a right Tragedy; I begin to know this better than I used to do. I have read three years on that piece of history,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The mid-seventeenth cent.</note> not to speak of long readings twenty years back; and still what to make of it, perhaps in far easier forms than that of Tragedy, I with a kind of despair have to confess that I do <hi rend="italic">not clearly know</hi>. Most probably you will decide on printing this <hi rend="italic">Strafford;</hi> against which, whatever private feelings I have, what more can I say? I will say as my last word,&#x2014;a safe enough word: Be at least in no haste to publish it. Let it lie there for a while till it <hi rend="italic">cool</hi>, till it get to a freer distance from you.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling followed TC&#x2019;s advice, and the play was not pbd. till summer <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>.</note> Had you once made a plunge into some altogether foreign element, and swam about there for a time, you will see <hi rend="italic">Strafford</hi> much more clearly from the other shore of that; and judge better of it what is to be done with it.</p>
<p>Of Dramatic <hi rend="italic">Art</hi>, tho&#x2019; I have eagerly listened to a Goethe speaking of it, and to several hundreds of other persons mumbling and trying to speak of it, I find that I, practically speaking, know yet almost as good as nothing. Indeed of <hi rend="italic">Art</hi> generally (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunst</hi></foreign> so-called) I can know almost nothing: my first and last secret of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunst</hi></foreign>, is to get a thorough <hi rend="italic">intelligence</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> to be painted, represented, or in whatever way set forth;&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, deep as Hades, high as Heaven, and written <hi rend="italic">so</hi>, as to the visual face of it, on our poor Earth! This once <hi rend="italic">blazing</hi> within one, if it will ever get to blaze, and bursting to be out, one has to take the whole dexterity of adaptation one is master of or has ever gathered from the four winds, and with tremendous struggling, really frightful struggling, contrive to exhibit it one way or other! This is not <hi rend="italic">Art</hi>, I know well; it is Robinson Crusoe, and not the Master of Woolwich, building a ship. Yet, at bottom, is there any Woolwich Builder for <hi rend="italic">such</hi> kinds of craft? What <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunst</hi></foreign> had Homer; what <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunst</hi></foreign> had Shakspeare? Patient docile valiant intelligence, conscious and unconscious, gathered from all winds, of these two things,&#x2014;their own faculty of utterance, and the audience (rude theatre, Ithacan farm-hall, or whatever it was) they had to utter to: add <hi rend="italic">only</hi> to which, as the soul of the whole, the above-said blazing radiant insight into the fact, blazing burning interest about it, and we have the whole Art of Shakspeare and Homer!&#x2014; To speak of Goethe, how the like of him is related to these two, would lead me a long way: but of Goethe too, and of all speaking men, I will say, The soul of all worth in them, without which none else is possible, and with which much is certain, are still that same radiant all-irradiating insight, that same burning interest, and the glorious melodious perennial <hi rend="italic">veracity</hi> that results from these two.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-25" n="14:25"/>Now, my Friend, what I fundamentally object to <hi rend="italic">Strafford</hi> is that even such an insight, such an interest, and consequently such a veracity is not there. You seem to me (if you will let the three-years reader speak to the one-year) not to have seized the true type of that Transaction, but a too untrue and superficial one. I object to the fate of Strafford being made to turn on any kind of <hi rend="italic">quiddity;</hi> it was a necessity of nature, and till you have shown it as such there is no right <hi rend="italic">Tragedy</hi> made of it. There is a tragic <hi rend="italic">anecdote</hi> made of it. I invite you to consider this. Then think what a misrepresentation you have had to make of the whole physiognomy of things in that opening of the Long Parliament;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Act 3; it met <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date>&#x2013;<date when="1653-00-00">53</date>, and in <date when="1641-00-00">1641</date> passed a bill of attainder against Strafford, which led to his execution.</note>&#x2014;all necessitated perhaps by Strafford&#x2019;s quiddity! The <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> it seems to me is far more tragical, nay is alone tragical; and it was the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> that you, by emblems and fictions &#x26;c, were to represent. Finally I ask you to revise and reconsider almost <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the characters, except Strafford and Lucy!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Carlisle.</note>&#x2014; Am not I a modest man! My good Sterling, I will cease scribbling, cease fretting you.

<p>You ask me how I like your last <hi rend="italic">sendings</hi>&#x2014;in answer I must begin a good way off&#x2014; When you took it into your dear head to make a quarrel with me about the <hi rend="italic">Election</hi>, actually to compain of me to my husband!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling wrote, <date when="1842-01-22">22 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;You have not intimated your celestial mind anent either of the heroic poems of mine that have passed under your notice: &#x26; I really wish to know what you think of them.&#x201D; For the tiff over <hi rend="italic">The Election</hi>, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401005-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>12:274&#x2013;76</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1840-10-05">5 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> (complaining of me to myself would not have been half so provoking) when you thus exposed me to you knew not what matrimonial thunders&#x2014;which however did not on that occasion so much as <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> to rumble&#x2014;my husband knowing me to be <hi rend="italic">innocent</hi> in the transaction as a sucking dove!

<p>Shortly after this L<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seems to be the last that has been preserved of her to Sterling,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There are three later letters, of [<date when="1843-06-00">June? 1843</date>], [<date when="1843-07-18">18 July 1843</date>], and [<date when="1843-08-16">16 Aug. 1843</date>].</note> there came ill news from Templand; ill news, or wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> to her vigilant affect<hi rend="italic">n</hi> had an ill sound in them, and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> indeed was soon followed by a doleful and irreparable calamity there. Something in a letter of her mother&#x2019;s, touching lightly enough on some disorder of health, she was under, and treating the case as common, and of no significance, at once excited my poor Jeannie&#x2019;s suspic<hi rend="italic">n;</hi> and I had to write to Dr Russell,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. James Russell of Thornhill; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320407-TC-AC-01"><sic>6:145</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1832-04-07">7 April 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> asking confidentially and as if for myself only What the real state of matters was.

And accordingly, almost by next letter (<date when="1842-02-23">23</date> or <date when="1842-02-24">24 feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date> I find it must have been), came tidings of &#x201C;a stroke,&#x201D; apoplectic, paralytic; immediate danger now over, but future danger fatally evid<hi rend="italic">t!</hi> My poor little Woman instantly got ready; that same night, (wild blustering, rainy night, darkness with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> us and within), I escorted her to Euston Square for the ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> train to Liverpool. She was deaf, or all but deaf to any words of hope I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> urge. Never shall I forget her look, as she sat in the railway carriage, seat next the window, still, close by me, but totally silent; her beautiful eyes full of sorrowful affect<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, gloomy<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS ends; from this point text is from Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>. Grace Welsh had a stroke about 1 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi> on Fri., <date when="1842-02-25">25 Feb.</date>, and Dr. Russell wrote immediately to the Carlyles. His letter was received only on Mon., <date when="1842-02-28">28 Feb.</date>, but Mrs. Welsh had d. about 10 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi> on Fri. JWC left for Liverpool, en route for Templand, on the 10:30 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi> mail-train on Mon., reaching Liverpool on Tues. morning, <date when="1842-03-01">1 March</date>, to hear of her mother&#x2019;s death. Meanwhile, TC had also heard of her mother&#x2019;s death, and wrote to JWC, but did not leave for Liverpool until the 10:30 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi> train on Thurs., <date when="1842-03-03">3 March</date>. On arrival, Fri. morning, he found JWC prostrate at Maryland St. and left that night by coach through Lancaster, Carlisle, and Annan to Dumfries, arriving early on Sat. and met by his sister Jean Aitken and his brother. By this time the funeral (which he had thought might be on that day) was over. At 10 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi> TC left Dumfries for Templand and arrived at noon. See also Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 82&#x2013;83.</note> pain, and expectation, gazing steadily forward, as if <pb id="pg-14-28" n="14:28"/>questioning the huge darkness, while the train rolled away. Alas, at Liverpool, her cousins (Maggie still remembers it here, after twenty-seven years) had to answer, &#x2018;All is over at Templand, cousin, gone, gone!&#x2019; and with difficulty, and with all the ingenuity of love and pity, got her conveyed to bed. <date when="1842-02-26">February 26,</date><note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact, <date when="1842-02-25">25 Feb.</date>; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420302-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, [<date when="1842-03-02">2 March</date>]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420309-TC-BB-01">TC to BB, <date when="1842-03-09">9 March</date></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi>, <date when="1842-03-10">10 March</date>; but sometimes recorded as <date when="1842-02-26">26 Feb.</date>, and in <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 83 as <date when="1842-02-20">20 Feb.</date></note> <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>, her mother had departed; that &#x2018;first stroke&#x2019; mercifully the final one. &#x2018;Uncle John,&#x2019; &#x26;c., from Liverpool, had found now no sister to welcome him; blithe Templand all fallen dark and silent now; Sister Jeannie, Father Walter, Sister Grizzie also no more there.</p>
<p>I followed to Liverpool two days after (funeral already not to be reached by me), found my poor Jeannie still in bed, sick of body, still more of mind and heart, miserable as I had never seen her. The same night I went by mail-coach (no railway farther for me) to Carlisle, thence through Annan, &#x26;c., and was at Templand next morning for a late breakfast. Journey in all parts of it still strangely memorable to me. Weather hard, hoar-frosty, windy; wrapt in an old dressing-gown with mackintosh buttoned round it, I effectually kept out the cold, and had a strange night of it, on the solitary coach-roof, under the waste-blowing skies, through the mountains, to Carlisle. It must have been Saturday, I now find, Carlisle market-day. Other side of that city we met groups of market-people; at length groups of Scotch farmers or dealers solidly jogging thither, in some of which I recognized old school-fellows! A certain &#x2018;Jock Beattie,&#x2019; perhaps twelve years my senior, a big good-humoured fellow finishing his arithmetics, &#x26;c., who used to be rather good to me, him I distinctly noticed after five-and-twenty years, grown to a grizzled, blue-visaged sturdy giant, sunk in comforters and woollen wrappages, plod-plodding there, at a stout pace, and still good-humouredly, to Carlisle market (as a big bacon-dealer, &#x26;c., it afterwards appeared), and had various thoughts about him, far as he was from thought of me! Jock&#x2019;s father, a prosperous enough country-carpenter, near by the kirk and school of Hoddam, was thrice-great as a ruling-elder (indeed, a very long-headed, strictly orthodox man), well known to my father, though I think silently not so well approved of in all points. &#x2018;Wull Beattie,&#x2019; was my father&#x2019;s name for him. Jock&#x2019;s eldest brother, &#x2018;Sandy Beattie,&#x2019;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s first Latin teacher; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341219-TC-DH-01"><sic>7:346</sic><corr>TC to DH, <date when="1834-12-19">19 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> a Probationer (Licentiate of the Burgher Church), stepping into our school one day, my age then between seven and eight, had reported to my father that I must go into Latin, that I was wasting my time otherwise, which brought me <pb id="pg-14-29" n="14:29"/>a Ruddiman&#x2019;s &#x2018;Rudiments,&#x2019;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Ruddiman (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210404-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:350</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1821-04-04">4 April 1821</date></corr></ref>), <hi rend="italic">The Rudiments of the Latin Tongue</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1714-00-00">1714</date>).</note> something of an event in the distance of the past. At Annan, in the rimy-hazy morning, I sat gazing on the old well-known houses, on the simmering populations now all new to me&#x2014;very strange, these old unaltered stone-and-mortar edifices, with their inmates changed and gone!&#x2014;meanwhile there stalked past, in some kind of rusty garniture against the cold, a dull, gloomy, hulk of a figure, whom I cleary recognized for &#x2018;Dr. Waugh,&#x2019;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. John Smith Waugh.</note> luckless big goose (with something better in him too, which all went to failure and futility), who is to me so tragically memorable! Him I saw in this unseen manner: him and no other known to me there&#x2014;him also for the last time. Six miles farther, I passed my sister Mary Austin&#x2019;s farmstead in Cummertrees. Poor kind Mary! little did she dream of me so near! At Dumfries, my sister Jean, who had got some inkling, was in waiting where the coach stopped; she half by force hurried me over to her house, which was near, gave me a hot cup of tea, &#x26;c., and had me back again in plenty of time. Soon after 10 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi> I was silently set down by the wayside, beckoned a hedger working not far off to carry my portmanteau the bit of furlong necessary, and, with thoughts enough articulate and inarticulate, entered the old Templand now become so new and ghastly.</p>
<p>For two months and more I had to continue there, sad but not unhappy. Good John Welsh with his eldest daughter Helen and a lady cousin of his,<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Martin.</note> good active people, were there to welcome me, and had the house all in order. In about a week these all went, but left an excellent old servant; and for the rest of the time I was as if in perfect solitude&#x2014;my converse with the mute universe mainly. Much there was to settle, and I had to speak and negotiate with various people, Duke&#x2019;s<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Francis Scott (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24929"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 5th duke of Buccleuch, from whom Templand was leased.</note> farm-agents; but that was only at intervals and for brief times; and, indeed, all that could have been finished soon, had the agent people (factor, subfactors, &#x26;c., &#x26;c.) been definite and alert with me, which they by no means were. Nay, ere long, I myself grew secretly to like the entire seclusion, the dumb company of earth and sky, and did not push as I might have done. Once or twice I drove across the hills to Annandale; had one of my brothers, Jamie or Alick, on this or the other &#x2018;errand,&#x2019; over to me for a day; had my dear old mother for perhaps a week at one time; I had also friendly calls to make (resolutely refusing all dinners); but on the whole felt that <pb id="pg-14-30" n="14:30"/>silence was the wholesome, strengthening, and welcome element. I walked a great deal, my thoughts sad and solemn, seldom or never merely painful&#x2014;sometimes in the great joyless stoicism (great as life itself), sometimes of victorious or high. The figure of the actual terrestrial &#x2018;spring&#x2019; (the first I had seen for years, the last I ever saw) was beautiful, symbolic to me, full of wild grandeur and meanings. By day, now bright sunshine and a tinge of hopeful green, then suddenly the storm-cloud seen gathering itself far up in the centre of the hills, and anon rushing down in mad fury, by its several valleys (Nith, &#x26;c., &#x26;c., which I could count); a canopy of circular storm, split into <hi rend="italic">spokes</hi>, and whitening everything with snow! I did not read much&#x2014;nothing that I now recollect: &#x2018;Cromwell&#x2019; books, which were then my serious reading, were, of course, all in Chelsea. By some accident, now forgotten, I had slid into something of correspondence with Lockhart more than I ever had before or after; three or four altogether friendly, serious, and pleasant notes from him I remember there, which I doubt are not now in existence.<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Only one has been found, of <date when="1842-04-01">1 April</date>. TC&#x2019;s view of Lockhart is repeated in his Journal, late <date when="1841-12-00">Dec. 1841</date>: &#x201C;Saw Lockhart on Sunday last; a sarcastic, hard, impatient, but intelligent not dishonest man.

Windy soul, flung aloft by popular delusion, he soon after died with all his vanities and glories!</p>
<p>My plan of business had at first been, &#x2018;Let us keep this house and garden as they are, and sublet the land; no prettier place of refuge for us could be in the world!&#x2019; But my poor darling shrank utterly from that, could not hear of it in her broken heart; which, alas, was natural too; so I had to get the lease valued, cancelled; sell off everything, annihilate all vestige of our past time there, a think I now again almost regret; and certainly, for the moment, it was in itself a very sad operation. The day of the household sale, which was horrible to me, I fled away to Crawford Churchyard (20 miles off, through the pass of Dalveen, &#x26;c.), leaving my brothers in charge of everything; spent the day there by my mother-in-law&#x2019;s grave and in driving thither and back; the day was of bright weather, the road silent and solitary. I was not <pb id="pg-14-31" n="14:31"/>very miserable; it was rather like a day of religious worship, till in the evening, within short way of Templand again, I met people carrying furniture (Oh heaven); found Templand a ruin, as if sown with salt; and had, from various causes, an altogether sorry night in Thornhill. Tedious pedantic &#x2018;factor&#x2019;<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William Maxwell, factor at Thornhill for the Duke of Buccleuch.</note> still lingering and loitering, I had still to wait at Scotsbrig, with occasional rides across to him, and messages and urgencies, before he would conclude; &#x2018;paltry little strutting creature,&#x2019; thought I sometimes (wrongfully, I have been told; at any rate, the poor little soul is now dead, <foreign><hi rend="italic">requiescat, requiescat!</hi></foreign> [May he rest! May he rest!]). It was not till the beginning of <date when="1842-05-00">May</date> that I got actually back to Chelsea, where my poor sorrow-stricken darling with Jeannie, her Liverpool cousin, had been all this while; and of course, though making little noise about it, was longing to have me back.</p>
<p>Her letters during those two months of absence seem to be all lost. I remember their tone of mournful tenderness; the business part, no doubt, related to the bits of memorials and household relies I was to bring with me, which, accordingly, were all carefully packed and conveyed, and remain here in pious preservation to this day: a poor praying child, some helpless enough rustic carving in funeral jet, commemorative of &#x2018;John Welsh&#x2019;; these and other such things, which had pleased her mother, though in secret not <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, she now accepted with repentant fondness, and kept as precious. She had great care about matters of that kind; had a real, though unbelieving, notion about omens, luck, &#x2018;first foot&#x2019; on New Year&#x2019;s morning, &#x26;c.; in fact, with the clearest and steadiest discerning head, a tremulously loving heart! I found her looking pale, thin, weak; she did not complain of health, but was evidently suffering that way too: what she did feel was of the mind, of the heart sunk in heaviness; and of this also she said little, even to me not much. Words could not avail: a mother and mother&#x2019;s love were gone, irrevocable; the sunny fields of the past had all become sunless, fateful, sorrowful, and would smile no more! A mother dead: it is an epoch for us all; and to each one of us it comes with a pungency as if peculiar, a look as of originality and singularity! Once or oftener she spoke to me in emphatic self-reproach, in vehement repentance about her mother: though seldom had any daughter intrinsically less ground for such a feeling. But, alas, we all have ground for it! could we but think of it sooner; inexpressible the sadness to think of it too late. That little fact of the &#x2018;two candles&#x2019; mentioned above,<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grace Welsh had bought the candles for a <foreign>soiree</foreign> at Cheyne Row; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390308-TC-MAC-01"><sic>11:39</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1839-03-08">8 March 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> reserved in sad penitence to be her own death-lights after <pb id="pg-14-32" n="14:32"/>seven-and-twenty years&#x2014;what a voice is in that, piercing to one&#x2019;s very soul! All her mother&#x2019;s &#x2018;poor people,&#x2019; poor old half-crazy &#x2018;Mary Mills,&#x2019; and several others (for Mrs. Welsh was ever beneficent and soft of heart), she took the strictest inheritance of, and punctually transmitted from her own small pin-money their respective doles at the due day, till the last of them died and needed no gift more. I well remember, now with emotion enough, the small bank cheques I used to write for her on those occasions, always accurately paid me on the spot, from her own small, small fund of pin-money (I do believe, the smallest any actual London lady, and she was even emphatically such, then had). How beautiful is noble poverty! richer, perhaps, than the noblest wealth! For the rest, I too have my self-reproaches; my sympathy for her, though sincere and honest, was not always perfect; no, not as hers for me in the like case had been. Once, and once only, she even said to me (I forget altogether for what) some thrice-sad words, &#x201C;It is the first time you show impatience with my grief, dear&#x2019;&#x2014;words which pain my heart at this moment. Ah me! &#x2018;too late&#x2019;; I also too late!</p>
<p>The summer could not but pass heavily in this manner; but it did grow quieter and quieter. Little cousin Jeannie was very affectionate and good; my own return had brought something of light into the household; various kind friends we had, who came about us diligently. Time itself, the grand soother and physician, was silently assuaging&#x2014;never fails to do so, unless one is oneself too near the <foreign><hi rend="italic">finis!</hi></foreign> Towards autumn Mrs. Buller, who had at the first meeting, years ago, recognized my Jeannie, and always, I think, liked her better and better, persuaded her to a visit of some three weeks out to Troston in Suffolk, where Mrs. Buller herself and husband were rusticating with the Rev. Reginald, their youngest son, who was parson there. This visit took effect, and even prospered beyond hope; agreeable in every essential way; entertaining to the parties; and lasted beyond bargain. It was the first reawakening to the sight of life for my poor heavy-laden one; a salutary turning aside, what we call diversion, of those sad currents and sad stagnancies of thought into a fruitfuller course; and, I think, did her a great deal of good. Lucid account is given of it in the six following letters which we have now arrived at, which I still recollect right well.<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420812-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1842-08-12">[12] Aug.</date></ref> Isabella, b.

<p>I have unluckily been <hi rend="italic">poisoned</hi> not perfidiously, by &#x201C;sympathetic cakes&#x201D; or the like, but in a straight forward well intentioned sort of a way by a present of unripe grapes&#x2014; If a City Alderman could be supposed to have died of <hi rend="italic">two, I</hi> may well be excused for having all but died of half a dozen&#x2014; Seriously I eat <hi rend="italic">five</hi> or <hi rend="italic">six</hi> of these unblessed grapes on Saturday evening, and the consequence has been cramp in my stomach for twenty four hours after!! which I can tell you is no joke.</p>

<salute>Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your little Letter; which was well worth writing. It is a pity not to take a little snip of paper and lay out a penny in such cases!</p>
<p>I had come to understand in some vague way that the unfortunate Hanning<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Hanning.</note> had sent tidings of himself, tho&#x2019; I knew not of what kind. There came one day this week a huge Newspaper from New York, price 2 pence; the meaning of which was at first a mystery: but on looking more intently at the address (especially at a wrong spelling in it) I began to recognise the hand of poor Rob, and the truth dawned on me into conviction! Two days afterwards there came (I think, addressed by Jean from Dumfries&#x2014;contrary to all laws of Postage!) a second American Newspaper called <hi rend="italic">Newburgh Gazette:</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pbd. Newburgh, N.Y.</note> Jean, I suppose, had received that Note of Existence for her share.&#x2014; There was a Letter from Jenny at Gill, last night along with yours; but at that time she had not received the Letter: indeed as I find on computing, she had not then had time.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;head-ostlership,&#x201D; tho&#x2019; certainly none of the most brilliant appointments, will perhaps do as well as a better one for such a luckless <foreign>Gomeral</foreign> [fool]. He has proved himself <hi rend="italic">unfit</hi> to be a <hi rend="italic">master</hi> in any sort, master even of himself: it will literally be good for him that he <pb id="pg-14-36" n="14:36"/>be a <hi rend="italic">servant</hi>, and kept safe in <hi rend="italic">subjection</hi>, till he learn a variety of essential things. His appointment to that servile condition, if he execute <hi rend="italic">it</hi> well, may really be the beginning of good to him. Jenny, I hope, has no idea of venturing so far away on that basis, till she see farther!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You are right in supposing that I am and have been very busy. I have begun a kind of Book on <hi rend="italic">Oliver Cromwell</hi>, and know not how in the world I shall get it written.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The MS of the <hi rend="italic">Historical Sketches</hi> (Strouse), on the last unnumbered page of a section on &#x201C;Laud&#x2019;s Life by Heylin,&#x201D; has the dated comment: &#x201C;&#x2018;I threw myself at the footstool of his throne&#x2019;&#x2014;O God! that came into my head this morning, <date when="1842-02-05">5 feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi>, 1842</date>; a strange, a wild and wondrous glimpse, for the first time these many years, into immensity: the true immense, of terror, of hope, and pity. My poor good <hi rend="italic">Alte</hi>, good and best.&#x201D; It is the only date of the kind in the whole MS (ignored by Alexander Carlyle in his edn. [<date when="1898-00-00">1898</date>]), most of which was probably written <date when="1843-09-00">Sept.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-10-00">Oct. 1843</date>. But it does date the rest of this disjointed sequence of notes, including: &#x201C;Life of Oliver: O Heaven there is no Life of him extant or now possible! Some half-dozen paltry ancedotes mostly copied from base-minded babbling Heath&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Flagellum</hi>, most of them turning out to be false when examined, none of them capable of being proved to be true: this is all we know of the first &#xBE; of Oliver&#x2019;s Biography. It is a Biography obliterated, never to be recovered; wiped out utterly as with a spunge. &#x2026; I will write thee on a shortish page of paper all that the industries of History know of it or can ever know.&#x201D;</note> Nay it is not properly <hi rend="italic">begun</hi> yet (for I burn all that I write); but I must begin it, and must end it. I shall have a terrible fight, for I know not how long;&#x2014;and be a poor correspondent, I doubt, but will get your excuses as before.</p>
<p>I wrote to my Mother this day week;&#x2014;or rather she <hi rend="italic">got</hi> my Note this day week. I here enclose you the answer above spoken of. In a most small note of Jenny&#x2019;s addressed to the Doctor, which I retain for tomorrow, Jenny says our Mother &#x201C;has been poorly&#x201D;: what is this? Jenny adds that she is &#x201C;now better.&#x201D; I wish I heard more especially, more minutely.</p>
<p>Jane stands the wild weather we have had better than I have often seen her do. I too go grumbling along, take large walks into the country, keep myself silent, do the best I can <hi rend="italic">to get work out of myself!</hi>&#x2014; On Saturday last, as you will perhaps hear otherwise, Jack and I were, among a crowd of people, presented to His Majesty of Prussia!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick William IV (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>), king of Prussia, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>, had come to be godfather at the christening of Albert Edward (<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1910-00-00">1910</date>), future Prince of Wales, on <date when="1842-01-25">25 Jan.</date> in St. George&#x2019;s Chapel, Windsor. On <date when="1842-01-29">29 Jan.</date> the king travelled in the new state railway train from Slough to Paddington, and visited the residence of Christian Carl Josias Bunsen (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>), the Prussian ambassador, at 4 Carlton Terrace.

(<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>).</note> So we will come alone, and hear the singing and the comedying, and be as blithe as the Fates allow.</p>
<p>Many kind thanks for the trouble you have taken, with such success, about the Hero-Book. I think there is great chance I shall <hi rend="italic">accept</hi> that offer. Your Chapman and Hall seem to be of another fibre than poor Fraser was!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall brought out the second edn. of <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> later in the year. Forster was acting as a scout for the firm and was also beginning to advise TC on dealings with publishers.</note> Their offer is at any rate an indubitable benefit to me; and I shall not forget them, nor it,&#x2014;nor you, I hope. Before Tuesday I will endeavour to bring Fraser&#x2019;s Successor<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Fraser&#x2019;s brother, either Alexander or Michael; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410826-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1841-08-26">26 Aug. 1841</date></ref>.</note> to a bearing, and hope then to be able to tell you something.</p>
<p>Will you go and protect poor Cochrane tonight from the fangs of Christie?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the previous committee meeting, <date when="1842-01-22">22 Jan.</date>, attended by Forster and Christie, but not TC, Cochrane had been told to lay before the next meeting, <date when="1842-02-05">5 Feb.</date>, a full statement of the library&#x2019;s debts and liabilities and full information about progress with the library catalogue.

<p><salute>Dear Alick,&#x2014;</salute>Here is a much smaller piece of paper than even the last! But I have a pair of stamps to send you;&#x2014;and will add my salutations with the new week.</p>
<p>Last Saturday being in great haste, and no stamps here, I took your Letter in my pocket, hastily flung it in as I passed an office; and reflected about a quarter of an hour after, with a kind of &#x201C;shock,&#x201D; that I had <hi rend="italic">forgotten</hi> to frank it; nay that I had come out with a new pair of trowsers on, and <hi rend="italic">no purse</hi> in them, and so <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not have franked it! The consequence is, I do in all law and reason owe you twopence; and so here are the two stamps; which I beg you will accept, as they are sent, with a kind of solemn smile!</p>
<p>Jack dined with us yesterday, as usual; in good health and heart, tho&#x2019; grumbling about the &#x201C;absurdity&#x201D; of his Patient, of his wearisome task, &#x26;c</p>
<p>A new edition of the last Book (on Heroes) is required; and I have a much better offer for it than ever Fraser gave or would have given. Fraser gave me poor &#xa3;75 for the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> edition, which is far the best usually, and a new man now offers me &#xa3;100 for the second. Of course nobody shall get it for <hi rend="italic">less</hi>. I am even thinking to try if I cannot get <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my Books taken out of the drivelling hands in which they now lie, forcing their <hi rend="italic">own</hi> sale, not in the least assisted by their salesman, who nevertheless swallows some three-fourths of the whole produce for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> trouble! We shall see about it.&#x2014; I find myself, one way and another, several hundred pounds poorer than I expected to be at this date;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had already noted his concern in the Forster MS, f.96v.&#x2013;97r.: &#x201C;Tuesday <date when="1842-01-25">25 jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1842</date>.&#x2014; A somewhat surprising announcement of, what had long been demanded, the state of our finance-department will force me from this day to look with a direct eye to <hi rend="italic">immediate practice</hi> in regard to this matter of Cromwell! With a terrible effort I must try whether in very fact it is anything or nothing that can be made of it. Heaven help me, strengthen my poor hand.&#x201D;</note> so that the new &#xa3;100 is a welcome enough supply just now. Independent <pb id="pg-14-39" n="14:39"/>of it I was not in any strait or anxiety about money (thank Heaven for that!)&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">Mall</hi> must be <hi rend="italic">kept in shaft</hi> too, and that is a business of <hi rend="italic">perpetual</hi> cost here.</p>
<p>Peel, it is thought, will make an <hi rend="italic">effectual</hi> operation on the Corn Laws; whereby some improvement of trade seems possible before long. He is not going to work in <hi rend="italic">Emigration</hi> just at present;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peel had announced, <date when="1842-02-03">3 Feb.</date>, that the govt. would introduce its plan for the Corn Laws, <date when="1842-02-09">9 Feb.</date> It had been rumored in the press that it was also planning an emigration scheme, which Peel denied; but it did introduce a bill, <date when="1842-02-04">4 Feb.</date>, to protect poor emigrants against frauds during their passage. The Queen&#x2019;s speech, opening the new session, spoke of her &#x201C;deep regret&#x201D; at &#x201C;the continued distress in the manufacturing districts of the country.&#x201D;</note> and I suppose is right,&#x2014;for the radicals are all set against it, and say always, &#x201C;Why banish <hi rend="italic">us</hi> to seek food? Let us seek food <hi rend="italic">freely</hi> where we are, and try that!&#x201D; They will try it accordingly; and not prosper in it, as I guess; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> Emigration will be welcomer.&#x2014; The distress of the people of Britain this winter, I believe, excels all that they have ever known before. One does not see so much of it immediately in this quarter, or indeed in this City at all; but I believe it is deep and desperate enough here too. The Spital-Fields Weavers live far on the opposite side of City, seven miles from us and more; of them we hear only thro&#x2019; the Newspapers, like you. But here at Chelsea, for the first time, I notice the garden palings torn up this winter and stolen for fuel,&#x2014;a bitter symptom, for the people in general are very honest. Poor creatures!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jean at a<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> Dumfries had a Letter <hi rend="italic">giving</hi> some account of what our Prussian Majesty was like, that day. If you have any curiosity, you will see it I doubt not.</p>
<p>Our Mother, it seems, is coming home soon. I wish I heard she were home, and well.&#x2014; Perhaps you have seen that Letter of Johnstone the Schoolmaster:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified; presumably not the Rev. John Johnstone.</note> it is a curious document! I am told his Book is by no means without worth.</p>
<p>Our Dame here salutes you all. Remember me to Jenny, to Jane and Tom,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">smaller</hi> branches are somewhat indistinct to me. I have written four times as much as I meant. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother.&#x2014; Your affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi>&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Yesterday after your Note I proceeded straight to Fraser;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Fraser&#x2019;s brother, an attorney and executor of his brother&#x2019;s estate.</note> who gave me a higgling, timorous, attorney response&#x2014;and &#x201C;would require to consult the other executor.&#x201D; He <hi rend="italic">wished</hi> to retain me,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As an author pbd. by Fraser.</note> wished to persuade me that he could (which I questioned or denied); on the whole he talked like an accurate innocent kind of man, but also like an attorney which he is. I am to hear from him without delay; and will directly thereupon apprise you, and call upon the new Booksellers<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall, with whom TC was negotiating through Forster.</note> to set them into action, if it turn out that anything can be acted.</p>
<p>I wish heartily my Books every leaf of them were in the hands of Ch. and Hall; it would be a real advantage, I believe. We shall try.</p>
<p>My Wife has a disagreeable cold (getting better now), and is prisoner there these days.</p>
<p>As for me&#x2014; O Heaven!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear <hi rend="italic">Angel</hi></salute>
<p>Mazzini happened to be here when your note arrived, so that I was enabled to come to immediate clear-seeing on all the points of doubt. Moreover he mended me a pen, so that I am also enabled to answer you in a more christian fashion than usual.</p>
<p>We think that Ruffini ought by all means <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to see Miss Patterson&#x2019;s despair&#x2014;first, because his arrangements are all <hi rend="italic">concluded</hi> for trying this thing, and secondly because we hope better things tho the kind Lady thus speaks&#x2014; The Giglioli whom she instances is Ruffini&#x2019;s particular friend&#x2014;and it is at <hi rend="italic">his</hi> instigation that Ruffini is embarking in the <pb id="pg-14-44" n="14:44"/>enterprise&#x2014;he, Giglioli, intending to return to his original profession of D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> of medicine&#x2014;and make over to Ruffini his pupils and interest.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Agostino Ruffini had moved to Edinburgh in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400316-TC-SWH-01"><sic>12:74</sic><corr>TC to SWH, <date when="1840-03-16">16 March 1840</date></corr></ref>. Mazzini explained to his mother that his friend Giglioli had transferred all his teaching to Ruffini for a year while he tried his fortune as a doctor nr. London and that if he succeeded, Ruffini would keep it (<hi rend="italic">Scritti di Mazzini</hi> [Imola, <date when="1915-00-00">1915</date>] 23, 82, 163). Miss Patterson, possibly of 52 Albany St., Edinburgh, not knowing of this arrangement had presumably written to warn that there was already a teacher of Italian in Edinburgh. Both Ruffini and Giglioli are listed as such in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh P.O. Guide</hi>, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">42</date>. Giuseppe Giglioli (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>), patriot, left Italy for political reasons, <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>; returned <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>, forced to leave, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>; joined Young Italy in France; in London, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">36</date>, then Edinburgh where he studied medicine, graduating with a thesis on &#x201C;An Introduction to a Dynamical Theory of Nature,&#x201D; <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>, and taught Italian, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>. He returned to practice medicine, nr. London, some time before <date when="1842-03-00">March</date>, according to Mazzini, possibly late <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; worked with Mazzini in Young Italy; returned to Italy, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>; briefly a public official in Modena; lived in Genoa till <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>, then prof. of anthropology in Pavia and then Pisa.</note> (I do not know whether they mean that this should be made public at present; so you may as well send it no further than M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Rich) Nor is Giglioli so ill off for pupils&#x2014;at least he himself represents the matter differently, and one would suppose he would be cautious of giving a poetical representation of his circumstances, at the risk of having himself encumbered with a necessitous countryman, while unable to support himself. So you see &#x201C;there is life in a muscle&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the second head of method&#x2014;I can assure you, on the best authority, that you may send what invitation you like to Mazzini, without the slightest apprehension of his parading before your door with a stick&#x2014;or sending you a challenge in the name of <foreign><hi rend="italic">La Jeune Italie</hi></foreign> [Young Italy]. As for us, poor wretches, to be sure we should like to &#x2018;assist,&#x2019; but&#x2014;East wind and Influenza will be hurried for nobody&#x2019;s pleasure and I am afraid you will not judge it expedient to wait their natural term&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever yours affectionately</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>By Alick&#x2019;s little Note I learn very gladly that you have got home again. He admits that you have been decidedly out of order, that you are still very thin; but assures me that you are now getting round again. I wish heartily I heard that you <hi rend="italic">were</hi> got round again! Your best <pb id="pg-14-45" n="14:45"/>state of health is no very splendid one; we cannot well afford to have you far under that. My dear Mother, I wish there were some one beside you to <hi rend="italic">enforce</hi> a proper attention to diet and regimen; I believe a great deal depends upon that. Good diet and warm clothing: these two are the most important points of all. I have directed Alick to send you over two bottles of the best Port-wine he can get; and I will beg of you to take a glass of it every day at dinner: you will find it do you some real good I think, if it be <hi rend="italic">good</hi> itself. I will also request you to dine upon <hi rend="italic">hens</hi> again for a while; there is no wholesomer dinner than a &#x201C;boiled quarter of a hen,&#x201D;&#x2014;as I myself, under <hi rend="italic">your</hi> nursing, dear Mother, long ago experienced! And so I pray you to avoid the bitter spring winds, and all evil influences that you can possibly get away from; to be doubly careful of yourself;&#x2014;and on the whole to get well again, for all our sakes as well as yours.</p>
<p>Jane here, within the last four days, has fallen into a disagreeable fit of Spring cold; which keeps her within doors, and annoys her somewhat: we hope it will take its departure before long. She does not cough, she merely <hi rend="italic">snifters</hi> &#x26;c; and we flatter ourselves it will not get the length of coughing. The rest of us are all in the usual way: Jack&#x2019;s fit of cold, which he had last sunday, is off (as appears by his note of today), and we hope to see him fresh as ever the day after tomorrow. I too keep my feet very handsomely, tho&#x2019; in the birth-throes of a Book, as you know! It is a terrible business and will not get on with me hitherto at all; so the whole soul of me is filled as with a black confused lake, for which there is yet no outlet: a very unjoyful state of things. But I have known by past experience that such <hi rend="italic">lakes</hi> do get an outlet; and indeed generally that the more painful the <hi rend="italic">birth</hi> the better is the child born: so we must not complain at all, but hold on, and consider ourselves very fortunate and greatly honoured that <hi rend="italic">have</hi> such pains laid upon us, were they far more painful. I am still going very <foreign><hi rend="italic">cannily</hi></foreign> [carefully] to work; and will not &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">dad myself a&#x2019;abreed</hi></foreign> [shake myself to pieces].&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380330-TC-MAC-01"><sic>10:54</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1838-03-30">30 March 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>For the present I have an additional task; that of getting my Books out of the hands of Fraser&#x2019;s executors, and put (if I can) into the care of another Bookseller, who I hope may make more of them for me. It is a most barren affair hitherto the Fraser one; and a much likelier Bookseller is willing to undertake for me,&#x2014;provided I can get the goods fairly delivered out of the hands where they now are. It will be decided perhaps in a week now. The <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> is that the poor Books lie where they are, and go on as they have been doing; and this I begin to think is the likeliest way of it <hi rend="italic">for the present</hi>. But in any new Book I <pb id="pg-14-46" n="14:46"/>may write, I will take another way of it, a far other! And all the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Books too will deliver <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi> quite quietly by the mere aid of time, by and by. So we shall not mind it much; but only wish it would get settled one way or other, and leave us alone of it. Writing of Books, not getting paid for them appears to be my task in this world; and is my <hi rend="italic">interest</hi> too: for verily what will all the payment in Creation concern me in a very little while hence, and then thro&#x2019; all Eternity thereafter? Literally nothing at all! It will be no matter to a man whether they emptied the whole Bank of England upon him for wages, or declined giving anything but mere <foreign><hi rend="italic">breeks</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">brose</hi></foreign>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Literally: trousers and the uncooked dish of boiling water mixed with oatmeal, salt and butter; figuratively: a living.</note> or not even that; literally <hi rend="italic">no</hi> matter to him whatever! Let them take their own way then. My dear Mother, I am everlastingly <hi rend="italic">your</hi> debtor for having from the beginning of my days taught me this lesson, and inculcated it by all methods upon me: it is upon the whole worth all the lessons in the world, and all the others without it are worth nothing.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Poor little Jenny will not think of America or her Luckless<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Hanning in New York.</note> in these circumstances. The best were that she looked out for some little <foreign><hi rend="italic">hadding</hi></foreign> of her own before Whitsunday; she shall be backed out in that, and will gradually come to a firm footing in her new circumstances,&#x2014;very <hi rend="italic">new</hi>, little calculated on, and painful; but which may be managed too, and better than ever, if she will stand to them!</p>
<p>We commend ourselves to Isabella and Jamie: poor Isabella, I have often thought of her unspoken sorrows<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her son Tom&#x2019;s death.</note> in these last months. We are &#x201C;born to trouble&#x201D;:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 5:7.</note> but <hi rend="italic">all</hi> trouble may be either a blessing to us, or mere trouble and a curse, according as we bear it and learn from it.&#x2014; I send Jamie a Newspaper some times; I wish he would write on occasion.</p>
<p>It is bright spring weather; people all digging their gardens. <closer><salute>Farewell dear Mother. Take care of yourself, and get right, I beg of you!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your attention about the cloak: the cloth is very nice indeed (much like a new dressing-gown I have got here), and if the garment was well lined, as I hope and believe, it will make a comfortable wrappage for our good Mother. She well deserves to be <hi rend="italic">wrapt</hi>, and kept as warm in all ways, as any and all of us can manage to make her.&#x2014; I have sent the cash here: it is in your Husband&#x2019;s name; he is more of a locomotive character than you, I suppose. It will come with perfect safety, I believe; but I know not whether you will not have to wait for a day or two.</p>
<p>Your fears lest I become <hi rend="italic">King</hi> are of a very surprising sort! Once about two years ago, while I was writing <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>, it came into my head, as much mad and maddest stuff will occasionally come, on one of my solitary rides: &#x201C;Well now, suppose they were to make <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> Cromwell of it all?&#x201D; I felt that I did heartily thank Heaven there was no danger of that! As Cromwell himself said. &#x201C;For the few years one has to live I had far rather keep sheep.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Speech to parliament, <date when="1658-02-00">Feb. 1658</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 9:175&#x2013;76.</note>&#x2014; The sliding-scale man will verily, as you say, slide <hi rend="italic">into</hi> the scale and be found too light:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to the sliding scale of corn duties which Peel introduced to the House of Commons, <date when="1842-02-09">9 Feb.</date> On <date when="1842-02-24">24 Feb.</date> the govt. defeated a motion for the repeal of the Corn Laws.</note> I often with a real awe seem to see them sliding thither <hi rend="italic">very fast</hi>.</p>
<p>My poor Book is still in the agonies; not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> begun! It will perhaps grow to a Book nevertheless.</p>
<p>I am well enough; Jane has had a cold for the last week, but is recovering gradually. Jack was here to dinner, as usual, last night: well and brisk.&#x2014; Wretched Hanning, dud of duds!&#x2014; <closer><salute>I have no time or paper more.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Yesternight your kind unexpected Gift was handed in to me, and received with hearty welcome. As my Wife laid instant hold of the Book,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Zanoni</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>).</note> and still busily reads in it, I have yet got but a few hasty glances and snatches here and there; but I will not delay returning many cordial thanks for so distinguished a mark of your attention, which is and will be very valuable to me.</p>
<p>By various indications<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably from JWC and from Forster, who reviewed it in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1842-02-26">26 Feb.</date>, as &#x201C;an eloquent and thoughtful book&#x2014;beyond question.&#x201D;</note> I confidently gather, and indeed could have concluded beforehand, that this Book, like its predecessors, will be read and scanned far and wide; that it will be a liberating <hi rend="italic">voice</hi> for much that lay dumb imprisoned in many human souls;&#x2014;that it will <pb id="pg-14-49" n="14:49"/>shake old deep-set errors looser in their rootings; and thro&#x2019; such chinks as are possible, let in light on dark places very greatly in need of light! I honour much the unwearied steadfast perseverance with which you prosecute this painfullest but also noblest of human callings,&#x2014;almost the summary of all that is left of nobleness in human callings, in these poor days. I cordially wish you a long course, and a more and more victorious one; and am always,</p>

<p>I am continuing to mend. If I could only get a good sleep, I should be quite recovered; but, alas! we are gone to the devil again in the sleeping department. That dreadful woman next door, instead of putting away the cock which we so pathetically appealed against, has produced another. The servant has ceased to take charge of them. They are stuffed with ever so many hens into a small hencoop every night, and left out of doors the night long. Of course they are not comfortable, and of course they crow and screech not only from daylight, but from midnight, and so near that it goes through one&#x2019;s head every time like a sword. The night before last they woke me every quarter of an hour, but I slept some in the intervals; for they had not succeeded in rousing <hi rend="italic">him</hi> above. But last night they had him up at three. He went to bed again, and got some sleep after, the &#x2018;horrors&#x2019; not recommencing their efforts till five; but I, listening every minute for a new screech that would send him down a second time and prepare such wretchedness for the day, could sleep no more.</p>
<p>What is to be done God knows! If this goes on, he will soon be in Bedlam; and I too, for anything I see to the contrary: and how to hinder it from going on? The last note we sent the cruel woman would not open. I send for the maid, and she will not come. I would give them guineas for quiet, but they prefer tormenting us. In the <hi rend="italic">law</hi> there is no resource in such cases. They may keep wild beasts in their back yard if they choose to do so. Carlyle swears he will shoot them, and orders me to borrow Mazzini&#x2019;s gun. Shoot them with all my heart if the consequences were merely having to go to a police office and pay the damage. But the woman would only be irritated thereby into getting fifty <pb id="pg-14-50" n="14:50"/>instead of two. If there is to be any shooting, however, I will do it myself. It will sound better my shooting them on principle than his doing it in a passion.</p>
<p>This despicable nuisance is not at all unlikely to drive us out of the house after all, just when he had reconciled himself to stay in it. How one is vexed with little things in this life! The great evils one triumphs over bravely, but the little eat away one&#x2019;s heart.</p>

<salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
<p>Will you be so good as write a word of answer to the enclosed Letter, just received here; which proceeds upon the &#x201C;Trades&#x2019; Sale&#x201D; hypothesis! That surely was a most astonishing solution,&#x2014;which I am greatly obliged to Mr F.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Fraser&#x2019;s brother and executor. A trade&#x2019;s sale would have remaindered the book in question.</note> for proposing to you!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I suppose Mr Forster has told you that the Book on <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> lies ready here for Robson&#x2019;s Boy (since you are so obliging as to adopt Robson), and that we will choose the cheap edition (of 1250 was it not?) as the preferable.</p>
<p>I am very glad my Books <supplied>[are]</supplied> safe in you hands. One of these days, perhaps today itself if I can get so far, I mean to call at N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 186,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Strand, Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s office.</note> and adjust one or two little things.</p>

<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;The question now however is, what to do?

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday a Letter came announcing that poor Mrs Welsh, who had been very poorly for some time (but seemed to be recovering) was suddenly seized with something like a stroke of palsy on friday morning last; at which Dr Russell, as natural, expressed himself highly alarmed. My poor Wife, almost out of herself, insisted on setting off by the very earliest train, tho&#x2019; ill of a cold and in no condition for travelling. She went last night at 8&#xBD; o&#x2019;clock; one of the saddest-looking travellers I ever saw. She would arrive this morning, about six, at Liverpool. Alas, alas, the poor thing (as I now learn by a new Letter which has just arrived) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> find there that her kind ever-affectionate much-suffering Mother was already gone! She had never awakened from that plasy-stroke,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> but died that same evening at half-past ten o&#x2019;clock. O Dear, O Dear!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>I am of course all in a whirl of thoughts that cannot be uttered. My poor little Jean is at this moment breaking her heart at Liverpool, where there is nobody but some of her young female cousins to receive her. Her uncle and Walter (I find by the new Letter of this morning) were already to go away yesterday. I know not what course will have to be taken.</p>
<p>I will write to you again, probably in two days more. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> at present dear Mother. Oh me!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Come to me directly if you be at home.</p>
<p>Yesterday news arrived that poor Mrs Welsh had suddenly sunk down, much worse, apparently in some kind of palsy-stroke. Jane, half-distracted, made instant preparation for setting off; I had to let her go, as really the mercifullest way. She went by the evening mail train, at half past eight last night.&#x2014; Poor little Jeannie! A new Letter crossed her on the road, and arrived here at noon: my poor little Traveller, hurrying on in her sickness in her agony of fear and hope, would learn when she got to the Uncle&#x2019;s door that she had no longer any mother.&#x2014; Poor Mrs Welsh had never awakened out of that sudden collapse; she expired the same evening about ten o&#x2019;clock.</p>
<p>I was sick at any rate: this stern thing has struck me altogether into confusion; and I see not yet what to do. Perhaps I too shall have to go in two days.</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I ordered a suit of Clothes and a hat: they are to be ready tomorrow morning at ten o&#x2019;clock;&#x2014;I consider now whether I could not have them two hours earlier, and so get away at eleven o&#x2019;clock? I will make the attempt this evening again. If anybody will <hi rend="italic">call</hi> at the Post-Office tomorrow evening (for there must be an evening mail too at Liverpool) you would learn whether I am to be expected that evening at nine, or not. Failing nine, expect me next morning by the train <hi rend="italic">you</hi> came by: and in that case, I must make no halt, but rush right on, to be at Dumfries and Templand some time in that same night. I wrote to your uncle yesterday; describing our positions. I have written again today; engaging to be at Templand, some time in Friday night,&#x2014;on the supposition that the sad solemnity is appointed for <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi>, which I think the probablest. If it be <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, but for an earlier day?

<p>On the whole, it will clearly be much better if I can get off at eleven; and I will certainly make a vigorous attempt again. It is the probablest way of it; but not the absolutely certain one. If I fail, and the Funeral <hi rend="italic">be</hi> on Saturday (as I suppose you will know by that time), it may for aught I know be necessary to my getting on to Dumfries that night, that some preliminary <hi rend="italic">bookings</hi> or I know not what be gone thro&#x2019;, in regard to getting into a coach at Lancaster: will Alick if he is with you, or some other if he is not, be so kind as have this managed for me,&#x2014;if indeed there be anything to manage.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420127-JWC-JOST-01">JWC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, [<date when="1842-01-27">27 Jan.</date>]</ref>; Alick Welsh.</note> I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> get on.</p>
<p>Dearest, I fear you are very ill, as truly will be no wonder at all. My poor little Jean!&#x2014; It is very doubtful to me whether <hi rend="italic">you</hi> ought to go on: it will depend on your own state, and whether you can have any composure where you are.

<p>Compose thyself my poor little Wife; sorrow, but not as the unwise. Ah me, it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> sorrowful, a right bitter sorrow! But God has done it; He and no other: there we must all of us rest.</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>My poor Mother-in-Law, Mrs Welsh whom you remember, has been suddenly called away out of this world. Her poor Daughter, who never dreamt of danger till Monday last, started from her sick-room at the first intimation, you may judge in what a state; and set off by the first railway-train of the same day. Alas, on reaching her Uncle&#x2019;s at Liverpool she learns that it is already all over; that her poor Mother never recovered from that sudden stroke (something of palsy, I take it), but expired on the evening of the same day, Friday last. My wife has paused at Liverpool; lies there very ill, as I conjecture; waiting till I come up, and decide whether she shall go farther. I go off tomorrow, and must travel without halting (as I compute) night and <pb id="pg-14-56" n="14:56"/>day.&#x2014; This I could not but intimate to you, spite of my haste; as it may be a week or two before we get back. Will you communicate it to the good Mrs Macready, and the rest that come in your way: my haste, these two days, has been excessive, and still is.</p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>The Printer has got the Book, and will proceed in it, I calculate, rapidly and satisfactorily without farther aid of mine. I have gone over it all, in these two days, and made it what it is finally to be. Robson can be depended on for correctness.</p>
<p>I have never got up to see the new Booksellers yet; I meant it today, but have never got across the threshold. I suppose there was a<supplied>[t]</supplied> bottom nothing essential to do there; or at least nothing that you will not look to better than I could have done. At first view I did not see the whole attorneyism of Fraser&#x2019;s notable proposal: I am very glad to be out of <hi rend="italic">such</hi> hands, and into such other, even at a little loss. The real <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of loss was one of the things I wished to ascertain today: but it is of small moment for the time being.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Forster; I am still driven in the extremity of haste. My address on Friday night is &#x201C;Templand, Thornhill, Dumfries&#x201D;: but you need not trouble yourself with me, till you hear again, I think; for my movements are all vague, and like to be swift and fretful.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>My poor Wife learned, yesterday morning, on arriving at her Uncle&#x2019;s in Liverpool, that it was already all over; that her Mother had departed on the evening of that same day of which we had got account when you were here. &#x1F38;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x1F78;&#x03CC; [The end], The end! There is something unnameable, unfathomable always in that.</p>
<p>I have to go off tomorrow; my Wife, who pauses at Liverpool till my arrival there, is, as I conjecture, very ill. Sick at any rate; and a kind good Mother snatched away from her, as it were the last of all her kindred in this lower scene.</p>
<p>I pray you explain to Rio how I could not come today; how I hope <pb id="pg-14-57" n="14:57"/>for a better time when he is next here. My haste, and confusion of soul and hand, these two days, have been extreme, and still are.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It is decided that I am to come up, and attend the Funeral. According to my guess, it will be on Saturday; but we lie in a confused posture for hearing: simply I have to make what utmost haste I can. On Friday night, by some conveyance or other, I expect to pass thro&#x2019; Dumfries: I shall not see Jean; I have written to her today, and bade her write to Jenny or Mary. You will apprise all the rest.</p>
<p>My poor Wife lies at Liverpool very ill: I am to decide, or help her to decide, whether she shall go on.&#x2014; I have also had my <hi rend="italic">new edition</hi> to make ready for the press in these days; nothing can be busier than I have been and am.</p>
<p>I will of course let you know about my movements: if you hear <hi rend="italic">nothing farther</hi>, you may fancy me at Templand on Saturday, and that you will hear of me or see me soon: but if I can I will write to you another word somewhere. Tomorrow I go off; uncertain whether at 11 o&#x2019;clock, or not till evening.</p>
<p>Good night, dear Mother. This sudden stroke has filled me with confusions. Jack is travelling about Oxford, of late days; I have not seen him since friday last.</p>

<salute>My poor Jeannie,</salute>
<p>I arrived here about noon; in such a condition as you may fancy me,&#x2014;as sad a man, I suppose, as was within many miles of me. My <pb id="pg-14-58" n="14:58"/>notion was that first of all I would secure myself if possible three hours of privacy and sleep: but there is no sleep to be had; the Mundells came in before I had got clean clothes on,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Mundell and his wife. He was rector of Wallace Hall School, Closeburn; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390805-TC-TA-01"><sic>11:164</sic><corr>TC to TA, <date when="1839-08-05">5 Aug. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> and there are to be Dr Russell and Mr Hunter of Morton Mill at dinner (to consult upon business indeed, if I had any wits left);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Hunter, lawyer, Galloway St., Dumfries, also of Morton Mill, nr. Thornhill, agent for the Duke.</note>&#x2014;so that on the whole you will expect nothing but a signature and token of arrival from me.</p>
<p>My Brother Jamie had been at the funeral; he waited me at the corner of James Aitken&#x2019;s street; James and he had both been there: this I was very glad of: they had sent my Mother an announcement, and Jamie without farther notice made ready and went. The only other piece of intelligence that gave me much satisfaction, was That they have buried her in poor Aunt Jeannie&#x2019;s grave:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie Welsh (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>); see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270604-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:232</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1827-06-04">4 June 1827</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280416-TC-JAC-01"><sic>358</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-04-16">16 April 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> she died in your Mother&#x2019;s arms, as I always will remember: in death they have not been divided.</p>
<p>I find here a very kind but unfruitful Letter from poor Craik, which is not worth sending. Another, extremely brief, from my Brother John,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Cheyne Row, [<date when="1842-03-03">3 March</date>].</note> falls under the same category.</p>
<p>Your good uncle I find has been extremely accurate in all his arrangements, and talks like one that would decidedly further the rational transaction of business. It was very wise to consult Hunter; but it would have been better had my head been in a sounder state.</p>
<p>Here is a Letter which seems to be from Jean; I send it without knowing what the contents are. I will attend to writing the Notes you wished by tomorrow&#x2019;s post.</p>
<p>A list of the people who attended the Funeral is here in a correct state; they have also (tho&#x2019; not very legibly written) lists of the persons who had an announcement: these, I suppose, Helen,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh.</note> who is writing to you somewhere in the house, will send.</p>

<salute>My poor Jeannie,</salute>
<p>Today I have sorted all the Papers with your Uncle: they are all tied up, sealed, and the places where they were found are marked. Not a clipping has been destroyed. There is no writing <hi rend="italic">for</hi> you; and but a few of your late Letters here. Helen and Mrs Martin<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cousin and neighbor of the Welshes in Liverpool; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340521-TC-JWC-01"><sic>7:169</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1834-05-21">21 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> are sorting the wearing things and ornaments: we will try to send the papers and what else is portable with Alick and Johnny, who go tomorrow.&#x2014; Today is so tempestuous and wet, it seems uncertain whether your Uncle and I will get up to Morton Mill,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To see Thomas Hunter; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420305-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1842-03-05">5 March</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;as I arranged on Saturday Night that we were to do; it was all I could make out that night. Tomorrow I must try to get down with Alick to Dumfries, and have a meeting with Adamson.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Adamson, agent for the British Linen Bank, Dumfries; also a lawyer and notary.</note> It looks as if it would be a tedious matter getting daylight and arrangement introduced into all the uncertainties and obscurities here. We are still a great crowd: silence and meditation will be necessary first.</p>
<p>We went all to the Church yesterday; the Minister (Murray of Morton) had a kind of Sermon appropriate to the occasion, as I thought: James Menteith &#x26;c waited to condole with us at the door.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Murray (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>), educ. St. Andrews Univ., minister of Morton, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>.

(<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), of Closeburn Hall and Mansfield. The service would have been in the new church built at Thornhill, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, and paid for by the Duke of Buccleuch.</note> I hope it was right, I gave half a sovereign at the plate. The day was bright; beautiful to me and solemn, as the memento of other worlds.</p>
<p>I wrote to Harriet,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Martineau.</note> to Thomas Erskine, a line also to Jeffrey. Was that all?</p>
<p>The Letter from my Sister Jean only came <hi rend="italic">this</hi> morning: the Saturday one I talked of was forgotten, and on the morrow it turned out to be from somebody &#x201C;Primrose Wilson,&#x201D; whom they all know, and whom I suppose you know,&#x2014; the late Landlady of the Commercial Inn.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Former landlady, wife of William Wilson of Dumfries.</note></p>
<p>Mary Mills is to be attended to: your Uncle had already bought <pb id="pg-14-60" n="14:60"/>her a suit of mourning; and insists on adding &#xa3;3 if I give five a-year. The mournings, accounts &#x26;c he understands that I am to pay.</p>
<p>The look of this Peggy Hiddlestone would be some comfort to you: a decent widow, of some five-and-thirty, with a face of much intelligence, honesty, affection and patient suffering: she also seems a most expert servant. One has a feeling of comfort to think that she was here. It seems she had offered long ago to come; but the wretched &#x201C;Mary&#x201D; concealed it from her mistress,&#x2014; anxious to be important and alone important!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; The other girl is a frightful blockhead: ah me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>There came a Note from Forster yesterday, and one from Emily Taylor: no importance.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emily Taylor (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27024/27026"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), author of children&#x2019;s books and misc. writings; second cousin of Harriet Martineau, who wrote of her in her <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> as &#x201C;an unwelcome and uncongenial person&#x201D; who came &#x201C;for a month, and stayed seven, in a lodging next door&#x201D; (2:155&#x2013;56); also related to Sarah Austin and Henry Reeve. In her letter of <date when="1842-03-03">3 March</date> she wrote: &#x201C;I saw M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Wedgwood today and asked anxiously if she had heard of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x2014;but she could tell me nothing.&#x201D; TC wrote on the back of her letter, which he apparently sent on to JWC: &#x201C;Not answered,&#x2014;needs no answer. I have written to Darwin. I will write to Mrs. Sterling. // Primrose Wilson&#x2019;s letter is fallen aside.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>They say you are <hi rend="italic">up</hi>, in the letter of this morning; I hope there is no mistake about the meaning of that. To Chelsea with Jeannie; there is no course but that, and at the earliest day.</p>
<p>All this House is like a Ghost to me: yet so still, clear and pure, like a kind of <hi rend="italic">blessed</hi> Spirit. The old feathers and gran-ears stick in the bottles on this mantelpiece (the green room); there are two <hi rend="italic">pennies</hi> with bits of wax on them,&#x2014; Helen thinks they are memorials of John Greig or Mr Bradfute.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gran-ears are feathery grasses used for decoration.

<p>I cannot yet send you a word of news, except that I am well, getting to my sleep again, and in a terrible crowd and confusion. Some of them are going away tomorrow; I shall get left to my own thoughts by and by, and then do better. I think of getting down to Dumfries <pb id="pg-14-61" n="14:61"/>tomorrow with the Travellers (Alick Welsh and the youngest Brother<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnnie.</note>) for the purpose of a meeting with Adamson the Factor;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Adamson, factor for Craigenputtoch.</note> I have told Jean I should most probably see her then,&#x2014;that is to say, be there then. It will be weeks, I think, before a good final arrangement can be made here. I will wait patiently, to see (if I can) into the bottom of matters before deciding.</p>
<p>Jane writes nothing herself; but the Liverpool Cousins report this morning that she is out of bed, and gathering strength. I wish I heard of her well home again with her Cousin.</p>
<p>You must not be impatient for news of me yet a while, dear Mother: so soon as I am left to myself, there will be something done perhaps, but little till then.</p>
<p>Take care of yourself, dear good Mother; and let us thank the Author of all mercies that we have the prospect of another meeting soon.&#x2014; I was very glad Jamie went to the Funeral; it will be a great comfort to Jane.</p>
<p>There is a Note from the Doctor; but except that he has come back to London, no news.</p>

<salute>Dear Betty,</salute>
<p>I will forward your Letter to poor Mrs Carlyle, who is still at Liverpool; who will be affected by <hi rend="italic">your</hi> continued affection.</p>
<p>We had never understood that Mrs Welsh was in any danger, but always that it was some common illness, and, in late weeks, that she was recovering. She had been much put about by a change of servants:&#x2014;it would have been a great comfort to us all that her good Betty of old days had been there! She did get an excellent woman some months ago;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret (Peggy) Hiddlestone.</note> a young widow connected from of old with the family. Her death was without pain, not unforeseen by herself as a possibility and even as a likelihood, but very sudden, indeed as it were instantaneous. The Doctor reckons it connected with some disorder of the <pb id="pg-14-62" n="14:62"/>heart; it seems to have been something of a palsy stroke. She dropped down while getting dressed, about 1 o&#x2019;clock, on Friday the <date when="1842-02-25">25<hi rend="italic">th</hi> last</date>; and lay without consciousness or appearance of pain, till 10 at night, when it all ended. A cousin of hers was here; and the Doctor&#x2019;s Wife, with whom she was intimate, happened to have called at the moment.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Martin and Mary Russell, b. Dobbie, wife of Dr. James Russell (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320407-TC-AC-01"><sic>6:145</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1832-04-07">7 April 1832</date></corr></ref>).</note></p>
<p>We had got no intimation of alarm till the Doctor&#x2019;s Letter written that day, which could not reach us in London till the Monday following. Mrs Carlyle, tho herself very unwell, made instantly ready, and set off: alas, at Liverpool, on the morrow morning, at her Uncle&#x2019;s door she met the fatal tidings.</p>
<p>I found her, as you may suppose, extremely miserable: she did not think of proceeding with me; indeed she had never been out of bed, nor able to sleep much in it. I have yet heard no word from her own hand: but the account of her Cousins is that she does gradually grow better. It was settled that she should return to London with Miss Jeannie Welsh, her Cousin whom she likes well, to nurse her. I have yet to stay here for a while, till affairs be settled, and this Establishment, which has now become a very sad one for us all, can get winded up.</p>
<p>These things I have written to you, dear Betty, knowing in what value you were held here, and deserved to be held. Mrs Carlyle&#x2019;s Address is: &#x201C;5. Cheyne Row, Chelsea, London&#x201D;: you can write to her at any time were this sad paroxysm once past.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Stanley,</salute>
<p>The reason why I do not call for you again, if you ever do me the great honour to think of it, is a very sad one: the unexpected death of my poor Wife&#x2019;s Mother, which has called me up hither for some time.</p>
<p>On the first intimation that her Mother was in danger the poor Daughter, herself sick, insisted on setting instantly off: she travelled all night; and at Liverpool on the morrow morning, at her Uncle&#x2019;s door, the news met her that already all was over. You can figure the rest.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-63" n="14:63"/>She is to return to Chelsea, in about a week, with one of her Cousins for Nurse; I shall have to stay here for a while yet, among the moaning spring winds and melancholy remembrances,&#x2014;anxious for the present that at least I could be left alone, all <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>.</p>
<p>This Note you will not account superfluous: it means at least that I remember you, that I have often remembered you, in these days.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Sterling,</salute>
<p>My Wife lay in bed, very poorly indeed, as I passed; and did not at all think of proceeding with me. Her bodily suffering she made light of,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; that too must have been miserable enough, and a sad aggravation to all the rest, for she was sleepless, worn out, and had some cough: but in mind I never saw her so cast down. The accounts from her Cousins are favourable; but I yet get no word from herself&#x2014; Yesterday there had for the first time been a night of good sleep, tho&#x2019; procured by medicines; and she was to drive out for a little during the day. She will be better at Chelsea, near you and other kind faces. Our arrangement was that she should return thither so soon as her Uncle got back from this place; which I think will be in about a week now.</p>
<p>I myself have to continue here for some time yet; many things are to be settled and finished off here.</p>
<p>Tell John he shall hear of me before long. Remember me very kindly to your husband. You will go and see poor Jane when she arrives. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mrs Sterling.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Miss Wilson,</salute>
<p>Instead of our meeting at Chelsea, a very sad errand has drawn me hither: the unexpected death of my Wife&#x2019;s Mother, whom I think you have seen, and whom your Brother, if I mistake not, knew.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-64" n="14:64"/>It was altogether sudden; tho&#x2019; preceded by more illness than we had been aware of. Our first intimation of alarm was on Monday gone a week; my poor Wife set off that very day; sick, in such a mood as you can fancy: she travelled all night; and at her Uncle&#x2019;s door in Liverpool, on the morrow morning, news met her that all was already ended.</p>
<p>I found her lying there, in a very pitiable way: it was settled that she should not attempt proceeding farther; that she should return to Chelsea with one of her Cousins for nurse, so soon as her Uncle returned from this place,&#x2014;probably about this day week. Time will bring solacement; Time alone can solace in such cases. All human consolations, philosophies &#x26;c break futile, like foam, from such a stern catastrophe coming suddenly on us.</p>
<p>I shall have to stay here for some time yet; adjusting many things. By and by in a calmer season I hope we shall again meet, again and often! <closer><salute>I remain always,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Yours very sincerely</salute></closer>

<p><salute>My Dearest,&#x2014;</salute> Will you not write me a little bulletin with your own hand? Our Cousins&#x2019; accounts are better and always better; but we hear of sleepless nights, Doctors, and sleep procured by medicine:&#x2014;I intreat thee, my poor little woman, compose thy sad heart: alas, alas, I bid thee cease to be miserable, and thou canst not cease! The stroke that has fallen is indeed irreparable; and tears, hot sorrowful tears are due to the Departed who will meet us here no more. &#x201C;We shall go to her, she shall not return to us.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 2 Sam. 12:23.</note> So it was in the Psalmist David&#x2019;s time, so it is in ours, and will be to the end of the world. A world long ago defined as &#x201C;a vale of tears&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note>&#x2014;in which, if we did not know of a very truth that <hi rend="small-caps">god</hi> presided over it, and did incessantly guide it towards Good and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> towards Evil, we were inconsolably wretched.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I approve much of Dr Neill;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently the physician attending JWC in Liverpool, called M&#x2019;Neill in <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420310-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-03-10">10 March</date></ref>. Possibly Dr. Hugh Neill, surgeon, 2 Oxford St., listed in the <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> Liverpool directory.

And also write to me! One little word; it is very sad, this utter muteness.</p>
<p>Last night as Alick will tell you, I went down with him to Dumfries; I saw Adamson for a while, who reported that all was in clearness and settlement, or nearly so, so far as he stood concerned; but that Hunter of Morton Mill was the authority on this Templand matter. Him, what with wet nights, what with &#x201C;letting of tolls,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunter was presumably engaged in seeing prospective tenants who might levy tolls.</note> we have never yet managed to see; but are to try it again this night. Your uncle and I are nearly thro&#x2019; the accounts: he pleads hard that he might be allowed to &#x201C;pay the half&#x201D; along with me; but will yield to my peremptoriness: I explain to him that it is all mine to pay, as much as my own coat is. The Books are sent to Mrs Dr Russell, whom we called on yesterday,&#x2014;a very kind and faithful-looking woman: her old father too we honoured as a worthy friend of one who was left too friendless here.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Dobbie (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), educ.

They invited us to dinner for Friday next with Aird &#x26;c:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Aird (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">76</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/247"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), poet and ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi>; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:361</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> of course we declined.&#x2014; Helen and Mrs Martin are busy this third day: they are packing up many things in the wardrobe; others, I suppose, must go in Boxes. Your uncle declines almost everything,&#x2014;his old Father&#x2019;s<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Welsh (<date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>).</note> desk &#x26;c; he says he does not like to keep such things about him; they but make him uselessly sad.&#x2014; Robert M&#x2019;Queen still continues here;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referred to in <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 113 as a cousin.</note> sleeping at Thornhill: I think I must give him some Book or other memorial; your Uncle means that he should get a large quantity of sugar &#x26;c that had been sent over hither.</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw Jardine the tenant here:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of the land attached to the house at Templand.</note> a son of his wishes to take this house, &#x201C;at whatever it is worth&#x201D;: I believe we shall get some bargain made out of it, and a settlement effected before very long. Were you once back at Chelsea you will be better able to tell me what things you can find room for, or specially wish to save.</p>
<p>About Monday, it seems, they expect all to go off for Liverpool: I will go down with them to Dumfries, consult Adamson &#x26;c, and then probably over into Annandale for a day. I think of keeping Peggy <pb id="pg-14-66" n="14:66"/>Hiddlestone here till all is finished: she pleases me much,&#x2014;the face of her must have been a solacement in those sad days.</p>
<p>I have written many Letters; one to poor Betty,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Braid.</note> among others; whose poor scrawl, received this morning will affect you, as it has done me.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; But above and before all things, my Dearest, try to get some sleep. Opium itself is better than sleeplessness. I will write a word tomorrow. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, God&#x2019;s Peace be with thee!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Jeannie,&#x2014;</salute> Thanks for your dear little Letter, which was a great consolation to me: it is all I could wish at present,&#x2014;the feelings in it and the tidings both acceptable. I am very glad they thought of M&#x2019;Neill:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mentioned as &#x201C;Dr. Neill&#x201D; in <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420309-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-03-09">9 March</date></ref>.</note> he will do you much good; he and the daily vehicle, and your own good resolutions.</p>
<p>Today I have often thought of your sad employment: ah me! But that too was to be done; in that sorrow too there is a kind of blessing.</p>
<p>We saw Hunter last night; a very zealous, sagacious and lively man; perfectly versed in the affairs of Templand; and indeed one, of whose helpful ways here I have long since heard tell. It was gratifying to see such a friendly feeling in the man, to find it credible that he had really been of much use. The scoundrel &#x201C;Charles&#x201D; (M&#x2019;Kie)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently the tenant of a farm not far from Templand, probably the farmer named &#x201C;Charles&#x201D; who married Mary, the Templand servant; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411124-JWC-IC-01">JWC to IC, [<date when="1841-11-24">24? Nov. 1841</date>]</ref>.</note> had been behaving very ill, as I understand,&#x2014;had not Adamson and Hunter been there to settle him. I continue to hope that it will not be difficult to form some conclusive bargain about Templand; so that we may finish off with it before long. But Hunter says it is essential that we do not <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> to be in any haste; which I believe.</p>
<p>Mrs Martin and Helen have now nearly done; Mrs Martin talks of going off to Moffat on Saturday: she is very quiet here, and very handy. Tomorrow there come two men (M&#x2019;Caig and another<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William McCaig and James Kennedy.</note>) to &#x201C;value&#x201D; the things, in reference to some tax they call a legacy-duty: a melancholy tax, of which I knew nothing till yesterday. I will then <pb id="pg-14-67" n="14:67"/>see if I can get settled altogether with your Uncle. On Saturday Walter<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Welsh.</note> and I propose to go to Barjarg<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Country house and estate 3&#xBD; mi.

On Monday they all go; probably I shall attend them to Dumfries, and thence perhaps go next day into Annandale for a couple of days.&#x2014; Today we made out two calls, your uncle and I, at the Mundells&#x2019;s and at Bennet&#x2019;s;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Bennett.</note> very dull work, but I suppose needful.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I have written a word to Helen at Chelsea; I said you would warn her of the day of your arrival, and she meanwhile was to send the Letters hither, once every two days.&#x2014; Your Aunt Ann&#x2019;s Letter, here inclosed will not avail much; but I send it as evidence of a wish to be kind and be profitable.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Welsh of 30 Clarence St., Edinburgh; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270604-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:232</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1827-06-04">4 June 1827</date></corr></ref>; a younger sister of JWC&#x2019;s father, she was a strict Presbyterian.</note></p>
<p>I have no power to write a word which is not worse than silence at present: I will add no more whatever. <closer><salute>I will commend my poor Jeannie to the Father of all the afflicted, the great Power, who is God alike of the Dead and of the Living: may His blessing ever be with us all.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear little Wife,&#x2014;</salute>Here is another mournful little duty thou must do: Robert M&#x2019;Queen is going off to Crawford<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nr. where Grace Welsh is buried.</note> on Monday, and I will set him on superintending this matter while there. We want the day of your Father&#x2019;s death;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1819-09-19">19 Sept. 1819</date>, for the tombstone.</note> which you can insert at the blank space, and so return the paper, if you approve of the wording of it. Your uncle says your name should be <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi>, like your Aunt&#x2019;s and Grandmother&#x2019;s: he approves of the rest: I strike out &#x201C;frail,&#x201D; as better spared.</p>
<p>The day is again a tempest of wet. I have got all your uncle&#x2019;s expenditures, household and everything else (not without difficulty), and they are all ready for paying when I get down with him to Dumfries on Monday. He has been very kind, manful and considerate; <hi rend="italic">his</hi> feelings <pb id="pg-14-68" n="14:68"/>doubtless are sad enough too, but he stands out like a rock, and yields very seldom to any shew of emotion.&#x2014; He has absolutely refused to have any concern with the furniture here; says it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> no longer his at all &#x26;c.&#x2014; The people are here (M&#x2019;Caig and another) even now, &#x201C;valuing&#x201D; for the tax-gatherer&#x2019;s sake:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William McCaig, cabinetmaker of Thornhill, and James Kennedy, upholsterer, made an inventory, valuing the household furniture at &#xa3;149.3.0, and noting cash in the house as &#xa3;9.10, and balance at the bank as &#xa3;212.5.3. This was to be confirmed, <date when="1842-03-30">30 March</date>, at Dumfries, before Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick, bart., of Closeburn, when TC testified that his mother-in-law had d. intestate, &#x201C;All of which is true as the deponent shall answer to God&#x201D; (Register House, Edinburgh, Record of inventories, 7.257.f.3).</note> so soon as they are gone, Mrs Martin and Helen will finish their packing, and lock everything up. There is a box of &#x201C;plate&#x201D;; all well and carefully packed: had I not better send that up to you at once? Mrs Martin talks of going tomorrow if it prove fair.</p>
<p>I am dreadfully sad in the mornings, before I get up and some kind of work or endeavour after work fallen to. One has to look at the black enemy steadily, and contemplate him, in solitude, for oneself. All sorrow is an <hi rend="italic">enemy;</hi> but it carries a <hi rend="italic">friend&#x2019;s message</hi> within it too. O my poor Jeannie, all <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> is as Death, and the Tree Igdrasil<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Norse mythology, the Tree of Life; see <hi rend="italic">Heroes, Works</hi> 5:20&#x2013;21.</note> which reaches up to <hi rend="italic">Heaven</hi>, goes down to the Kingdoms of Hela, and God (the Everlasting <hi rend="small-caps">good</hi> and <hi rend="small-caps">just</hi>) is in it all.&#x2014; We have no words for these things, we are to be silent about them; yet they are <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, forever true.</p>
<p>I had a very poor letter this morning from Jeffrey, who says he has written to you.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had written to Jeffrey, ca. <date when="1842-03-06">6 March</date>, and Jeffrey replied, <date when="1842-03-09">9 March</date>. Perhaps TC was offended because he thought that Jeffrey referred to possible financial benefit from Grace Welsh&#x2019;s death: &#x201C;I am sorry to find that you are likely to have other annoyances &#x2026; inseparable from such a calamity&#x2014;but trust that they will soon be got over&#x2014;and that the ultimate result may be to make the future course of your Life more tranquil and serene that it has been.&#x201D; Jeffrey&#x2019;s letter to JWC, also <date when="1842-03-09">9 March</date>, was longer and more sympathetic: &#x201C;My very Dear Jeannie I heard yesterday of the great affliction which had fallen on you. &#x2026; I have no comfort to offer you&#x2014;but only to remind you that you have always been a kind and affectionate daughter&#x2014;and to bid God bless and support you. &#x2026; At all events it cannot be painful to know that one of your oldest and most constant friends is thinking of you with all the tenderness and truth of our first friendship.&#x201D;</note> I will by no means forget Cavaignac. I have given Mrs Martin the two pictures of Stevenson (so like your uncle) and of the Duke of Wellington. The large oil-painting of Cousin Jeannie as a child, I thought of giving to <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, as likely to be interesting when she grew older; but they say she does not value it: is that so?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The pictures are untraced. Stevenson is probably George Stephenson (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26397"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), railway engineer.

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I know not whether this will be able to reach you before Tuesday morning:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1842-03-15">15 March</date>.</note> but at all events it may serve to warn my Mother and Isabella, and so be worth a penny.&#x2014; I do not know now whether we shall get direct down into Annandale, by the Gill &#x26;c, as originally proposed; whether we shall not be obliged to come up hither again, and so perhaps across by Lochmaben. At all events it will be better to make no appointment at Gill or elsewhere till you meet me on Tuesday.</p>
<p>I have heard from John; all is well at London: from my Wife (this morning for the second time); her health seems better, but her spirits are naturally altogether sunk, her whole heart disconsolate and desolate. She is able for travelling, she says; and will set off so soon as her Uncle returns,&#x2014;perhaps about friday or so.</p>
<p>On Tuesday you need not hurry yourself inordinately,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; if you should <hi rend="italic">miss</hi> this Letter, and come early in the morning, of course it will be no harm.</p>

<p><salute>My dear good Wife,&#x2014;</salute>I am very thankful for your kind good little Letter, which I found today at Thornhill; yesterday morning there had been another waiting me here: I am very thankful to have you write in that way; full of sorrow, but of a soft affectionate submissive sorrow. What more can one ask or hope in this cutting stroke which <supplied>[has]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> fallen suddenly with such a wound. May the sorrow be <hi rend="italic">blessed</hi> to us both, to make us both better, mindfuller of what alone is <hi rend="italic">true</hi> in life.</p>
<p>Your Uncle does not go till tomorrow; he will be with you at Liverpool on Wednesday evening: I go down with them to Dumfries; Walter is to turn up towards Glasgow, where a certain Mrs Chrystal<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of 13 Richmond St., Glasgow; a Welsh family friend, and presumably mother of Andrew, Jeannie Welsh&#x2019;s future husband.</note> lies dangerously sick, whom he is anxious to see. Jamie of Scotsbrig is to be waiting for me with a gig; but I will come up here with him again, to adjust the servants &#x26;c here, before I quit them even for a day. About friday I shall be back again, and then be left entirely alone, which will be far the suitablest condition for me in my present mood. The house has all a certain sacredness about it, which seems profaned by any kind of noise.</p>
<p>Today I left five pounds with Mrs Russell for poor Mary Mills, who is still here, but will go now to her own house shortly. Your Uncle added two sovereigns; but Mrs R. seemed to think that, with what poor Mary has from the Parish, about 2/ per week would be as much as she could get good of: Mrs R. was much gratified in undertaking to be almoner on this occasion. We have settled all accounts; all is smoothed into decent composure on that side, and blessings alone follow the Departed to her sacred home. O my dear Wife!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Your uncle has made over <hi rend="italic">all</hi> his accounts to me; and I have only a sum (of &#xa3;34) to pay him at Dumfries tomorrow.&#x2014; I think I will add &#xa3;10 more for you; and then, at London, you will find &#xa3;60 in the hands of Darwin. Your Uncle has been the friendliest of men to me all along; I feel much for him, for his uncomplaining sorrows which can neither be few nor small.&#x2014; Your directions as to the Pictures &#x26;c shall be accurately followed. The Templand Bible was already marked by a hand that cannot be gainsaid for your Cousin Jeannie; I will find something else for Jamie. The Canandaigua picture I was just thinking <pb id="pg-14-71" n="14:71"/>might be disposed of in the way now ordered.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A picture of John Greig&#x2019;s house in Canandaigua, N.Y.

<p>I too had a Letter from Thomas Erskine;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1842-03-11">11 March</date>.</note> very kind and pious: such words fall like dew on the parched grass, on such occasions.</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Your kind little Note reached me here; and I snatch a moment from manifold confusions to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>My poor Wife could come no farther than Liverpool; I had to leave her there very desolate and poorly in all ways. She is still there; waiting for her uncle&#x2019;s return from this place; which is to take effect now on Wednesday; after which she will go back to Chelsea with one of her female Cousins to nurse her, whom she likes well in that and all capacities. Her Notes to me are brief, quiet, and full of sorrow, which Time only can alleviate. Her Mother was among the most affectionate of Mothers, to this her only Daughter, who has now no Mother, and almost no kinsfolk left. It has been a very sad business, descending like a swift cutting stroke, where no stroke was apprehended.</p>
<p>As for me, many confused and very alien matters have fallen to my charge; in which I as yet by no means see what my true way is to be. I must take the problem deliberately; I long for a few days first of total solitude among the wild spring winds: their howling is a kind of appropriate music at present.</p>
<p>Thanks for your many services; for your kind offers of more. I know not what you can at this moment accomplish for me, if it were not perhaps that you stept over to Robson the Printer (New Street, Fetter <pb id="pg-14-72" n="14:72"/>Lane) some day, and saw with your eye that he was proceeding,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >With the second edn. of <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi>. Robson, Levey &#x26; Franklyn were at 24 Great New St., Fetter Lane according to the P.O. directory; and in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> were to be at no. 23.</note>&#x2014;as indeed I doubt not he is doing, in a satisfactory manner. My Wife will probably be home about the end of the week.</p>

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>You have heard, I believe, what tragedy has occurred here; a sudden stroke grievous to Friends of yours: I would have written specially to you an eight days ago, but that I knew your good Mother was to apprise you of what was essential; and then ever since my quitting London, I have been, and still am, driven about in a continual whirl, destructive to all composed expression of thoughts&#x2014;which do not in any case well fit themselves to utterance in words. Death is great; there is nothing else in Life that, in these days and in all days, still asserts itself as a miracle to the senses and hearts of all men.</p>
<p>My poor Wife has had a severe wound. The event was as good as entirely unexpected: her Mother was one of the kindest of women, whose faults were all of the surface, whose virtues came from instinct and lay deep: the poor Daughter has now no parents, hardly any kindred that was dear to her;&#x2014;a lonely outlook. Time alone can in some measure assuage such a feeling. Human sympathies too are always a medicine.</p>
<p>She is to get back to Chelsea, so soon <supplied>[as]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> her Liverpool Uncle (the last Uncle she now has, a good kind son of Nature) gets home from this place; which he expects to do about Wednesday: Jane will probably be home about the end of the week. One of her female cousins whom she likes well is to attend her. You know, I suppose, that she had got as far as Liverpool on the first summons of danger; and that at Liverpool the fatal tidings stopt her. There she still continues. I have got a Note or two, very quiet, but very mournful, very desolate. Pray write a word to her with your first opportunity, tho&#x2019; I should wait the longer.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-73" n="14:73"/>There remain here many matters, of a most alien nature, for me to settle. I shall have to take time, and deliberate. My first longing is for absolute solitude; that I might be left to myself and my own thoughts in the middle of these wild hills, and winds. All other discourse at first is poor. The great Earth with her sounding streams and change of seasons; she is still there, and another Life has been absorbed into her mysterious bosom,&#x2014;stern as very Death, yet beautiful also and true as Heaven and Life. Silence, Silence!&#x2014;</p>
<p>One of the last things I read was your Article for the F. Quarterly;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Characteristics of German Genius,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi> 29 (<date when="1842-04-00">April 1842</date>): 309&#x2013;29.</note> which I liked very much, bating perhaps a little rashness of phraseology here and there. You will write many other articles, I hope; and sound a message into the ears of some. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Sterling; good be ever with you.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Wife,&#x2014;</salute>I yesternight promised you a longer Note for today; and today they are all about me, and the afternoon is wet and keeps all within doors, so that I have no means to write. Indeed, as to business of any kind, there is yet nothing more to be written. I send you a small word, to prove that I am still here, still thinking of you and feeling for you. My poor little Jeannie: we are all spectators merely in comparison with her! None of us but she have lost a Mother: a kind friend with manifold claims on our love and remembrance has been sorrowfully taken from us all; but my poor Jeannie alone has had her heart torn asunder with a loss that can never in this world be replaced. God is great: there does come solacement assuagement to all; but that is a wound which can never be altogether healed.</p>
<p>To-day I have been at Burnswark with Jamie: poor Grahame is not there, he has been very sickly, sorrowful and dispirited, all winter, and is gone now to Glasgow for a few weeks, to try if the face of old friends will brighten him a little. I will take care to have the Picture conveyed to him;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Canandaigua picture mentioned in <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420314-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-03-14">14 March</date></ref>. See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420321-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1842-03-21">21 March</date></ref>.</note> it will be in good hands. His establishment today was the image of dreary melancholy; damp, desolate, silent poor. Life is not made of soft stuff for us, but of hard.</p>
<p>Your Uncle, before quitting Templand, seemed to have little wish for any farther connexion with it whatever. I pointed out to him the ease with which, by Peggy Hiddleston&#x2019;s means, it could be retained for them as a summer residence: if you, on farther examining, can trace any definite wish in him that way, you must inform me directly, and I could set about <hi rend="italic">so</hi> ordering the business. Otherwise I must straightway proceed to get a bargain made with the present tenant of the ground, or with another, and in some way get the matter put if possible entirely off my hands, and such articles as you have no value for changed into money. To me it will be one of the mournfullest scenes<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote &#x201C;scences.&#x201D;</note> and I can well believe my poor Jeannie wishes never to look upon it again. I understand it takes some three weeks to give proper notification &#x26;c; in about three weeks I might have it settled, and be making for London again. I do not dislike a kind of fellowship with <pb id="pg-14-75" n="14:75"/>the Dead for that length of time: it is very mournful almost awful, but it is wholesome useful for me. It is towards Eternity that we are all bound; it is <hi rend="italic">in</hi> Eternity that we already all live: and awful Death itself is but another phasis of Life which also is awful,&#x2014;fearful and wonderful, reaching to Heaven and to Hell! Ah me, one feels in those moments first of all, how beggarly almost insulting to one are all <hi rend="italic">words</hi> whatsoever, where such a <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> lies there arrived and visible.&#x2014; Enough, enough.</p>
<p>I am to return by Dumfries, I expect, tomorrow. My Mother is lamenting much that she did not go to Templand while at Dumfries in the winter: she is earnest to hear how you are; and feels, I dare say, how in the course of Nature it was <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> to have suffered rather than you in this case.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning that she was eleven years older than Mrs. Welsh.</note> The day and the hour knoweth no man.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mark 13:32.</note></p>
<p>I expect a Letter from you at Thornhill on Saturday morning or earlier. They wished and hoped you would &#x201C;stay a week or two&#x201D; with them, but I suppose that to be very unlikely. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear sorrowing Jeannie: God be with thee always.

<salute>My dear Jeannie,</salute>
<p>On Friday at Scotsbrig I was unwell, of my old complaint; and could hardly at any rate have travelled, the weather was so wild. I got up last night about 9 o&#x2019;clock; Jamie brought me, by the Gill and Dumfries, with one of his horses, in the Gig. He is to return tomorrow morning; then I am all alone here,&#x2014;a most melancholy place to me, but a kind of sacred one, of which and of so much else I feel myself as if taking a last farewell. We have had a most still and as it were solemn sunday; Jamie reading one of her Books; I studying to alter the Inscription,&#x2014;for, as you will see by Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Macqueen&#x2019;s Letter, the prior one was not what we had imagined it. I have written to your Uncle for farther counsel about the changes requisite. You may return Robert&#x2019;s Letter.&#x2014; No you need not return it; there is a copy here.</p>
<p>Your Letter among others lay waiting me last night: it was not <pb id="pg-14-76" n="14:76"/>dated, but I conjectured that friday was your day; as I now find by Helen&#x2019;s Letter just received, that it was. I hope to hear tomorrow that you arrived well without mischance; alas, it was at best a disastrous sad return! My poor Jeannie went away with hope struggling against fear, and now there is neither hope nor fear, only sorrowing love and regret forever henceforth.</p>
<p>The weatherglass shall go as you direct, and also the Book were it ready. I remember with a twinge of the heart how I heard that message of hers, and thought it a mere indifferent one.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I am to see Jardine; he must have the House, I suppose, and the things, except what we like must be sold: I see no other way of it; you cannot be expected ever to wish to behold it again, neither to me is it joyful, but mournful, vacant, all grown into the spectre of a place.</p>
<p>I have today given her <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi> to Jamie, and a Copy of the <hi rend="italic">Night Thoughts</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Young, <hi rend="italic">The Complaint. Or, Night-Thoughts on Life, Death, and Immortality</hi> (<date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1745-00-00">45</date>).</note> which was once yours; both of which he will prize much. Grahame&#x2019;s picture shall go tomorrow in the Gig. My Mother&#x2019;s little Chair (also a Templand gift) will get its poor little neighbour soon. The small round table here in the dining-room I find I must send to your Uncle, for it was his when a boy.&#x2014; On the whole you must think as soon as possible (at least as <hi rend="italic">convenient</hi>) what things you have room for; what we must leave here. The wardrobe and sideboard I consider are to come at any rate; the &#x201C;best bed&#x201D; could stand in our front room up stairs. We shall have time yet to consider farther.</p>
<p>My Mother at parting sent you her sympathy and blessing; &#x201C;thou must tell her too,&#x201D; she added, &#x201C;whatever ye may think of it that I hope she will get this great trouble sanctified to her yet,&#x201D;&#x2014;which, I said, I doubted not my poor Jane in her own way was even struggling to attain.</p>

<ps><p>Two of John&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">empty</hi> covers came to me also; I remembered at last that he was ordered to leave such with Ellen for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> convenience; and that he merely had not written.</p></ps>

<dateline><place>Templand</place>, Monday night <date when="1842-03-21">21 March, 1842</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>My Dearest&#x2014;</salute>This hand of mine is jerking at such a rate, I almost fear there will be no legible writing got out of it: but I have found there is a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> London post daily, and so you may still have a word in the evening, tho&#x2019; I am too late for your noon delivery,&#x2014;contrary to my wish and expectation. Wherefore I write, <foreign><hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi></foreign> [one way or the other].</p>
<p>We have been at Craigenputtoch, Jamie and I; and did not get home till past seven; <foreign><hi rend="italic">impransi</hi></foreign> [without food], we found no edible for man, nor, except the corn we carried, for beast. The journey was full of impressiveness, however, and I got several necessary affairs put in forwardness, or completed. Puttoch itself, especially Corson&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the Corson family of Nether Craigenputtoch.</note> part of it, is such a scene of mouldering putrescent slow ruination, as I have not before in my life seen; order had to be taken with it in several ways. M&#x2019;Adam&#x2019;s affairs go better;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph M&#x2019;Adam, tenant at Craigenputtoch; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320629-TC-AC-01"><sic>6:180</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1832-06-29">29 June 1832</date></corr></ref>. For his earlier damage at Craigenputtoch, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380706-TC-JCA-01"><sic>10:113</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1838-07-06">6 July 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> but his cattle have been shamefully busy in the woods;&#x2014;order as to that too. The Wife, poor body, seemed really to grieve for you. With the ass of a man I had to be peremptory and even emphatic. Glen<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Glen.</note> is evidently insane without hope of recovery; a tragic sight: I gave him the brass tobacco-box, and left him babbling mere bewilderment. In the silent spring weather, in the brown <pb id="pg-14-78" n="14:78"/>everlasting moors, it was <hi rend="italic">all</hi> a tragic sight.&#x2014; Our Laurel bush (do you remember it?) is grown a massive dumpy kind of <hi rend="italic">tree</hi>. There were other shrubs too that I recommended to the poor lazy slut Corson: he will not cut them at least. Alas, the identical <hi rend="italic">gate</hi> still hangs there; I remembered being found smearing it with coal-tar one sunny morning when she came who will never come again! God is above us, my Darling, around us and in us, for Life and for Death; otherwise this world were too cruel a world. Are not our Dead with Him, even as we are? Yes, in very deed.</p>
<p>The picture for Grahame goes with Jamie tomorrow. It was an unexpected volunteer proposal of his to take me up to Craigenputtoch this morning; I found he had made arrangements for the possibility of it before leaving home. It was unexpected: but I managed to have my interview with Jardine here nevertheless,&#x2014;a very honest-looking careful man, placed here mainly by the successful industry and piety of his son, whom also I thought very well of. It was as good as settled, I have ascertained that he was to have come and taken possession of the Cottage at least by Whitsunday next. I explained today that it was far from my purpose to <hi rend="italic">screw</hi> [practice extortion on] two such people; that the market value of the place was &#x26;c; that I would take &#x26;c &#x26;c: in short, I have good hope of getting soon a reasonable respectable and yet as it were charitable bargain made with the man, whereby the place shall become his, and <hi rend="italic">we</hi> shall never hear the name of it again. Enough, tonight.</p>
<p>Jamie sends you his affectionate sympathies; more genuine I believe than some that are better worded. Commend me well to the good Cousin Jeannie, and tell her to nurse you well, and we will all remember her help in need. God bless you both.&#x2014; Tomorrow there will be no post, I suppose. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign></salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>My dear Wife,&#x2014;</salute>I will write thee another word today, tho&#x2019; there is of course almost nothing more to be said. It is the first day of my entire solitude here; a bright pale March Day, defaced with occasional angry gusts of storm. I feel the whole universe, myself and her that is away to be full of mystery, of sorrow and greatness,&#x2014;godlike, the work <pb id="pg-14-79" n="14:79"/>wholly of a God. Lament not my poor Jane; as sure as we live, we shall yet go to her, we shall before long join her, and be united, we and all our Loved ones,&#x2014;even in such way as God Most High has seen good; <hi rend="italic">which</hi> way, of all conceivable ways, is it not verily the best? Speak as we will, there is nothing more to be spoken but even this: God is great, God is good; God&#x2019;s will be done. Flesh and blood do rebel, but the Spirit within us all answers, Yes, even so. My poor woman!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>It is not till tomorrow that I am to see the Jardines; but today a Mr Moffat<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified.</note> called, who proves to be the same Moffat I once used to apply to in agricultural difficulties over at Minnyive; a very sensible good little man, now Banker here; he also has a wish to have house and farm altogether. One way or other we shall get well enough quit of the house. The Jardines are good people whom I have decided to be soft with. Perhaps it would be as satisfactory to one&#x2019;s feelings to know that the long careful trimmings, and dressing up into utmost neatness, of everything here, did not go entirely to waste: yet it were better still that a charitable deed were done with them: I will therefore see at any rate that the Jardines get no damage by this newcomer. It is not to be decidable now till friday.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I have written to Morton Mill<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Thomas Hunter.</note> that a steady man may be sent to take away the weatherglass: I think it well bestowed.</p>
<p>The house once settled, it will behove us to decide without any delay what we are going to do with the things. I have sent you Helen&#x2019;s List: all but the things in page 3 are already gone towards Chelsea, and of page 3 I have taken a copy. Sideboard, wardrobe and your little chair, these I already decide upon: I would fain know your feeling about any other article you can remember. If not carried to London at once, it might perhaps be got put up in some place or other at Dumfries. Your feeling about the matter is at any rate a thing I want to have before me.</p>
<p>Once or twice today it strikes me: If you did not so dislike Craigenputtoch, might one not carry all over thither, build them together again, and avoid a sale altogether! But this I am afraid is rather wild. I myself have no love for Craigenputtoch (especially with an entire ass<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Corson.</note> for sole neighbour); but the place might still be saved, made even neater than ever; and while it continues ours, there is even a kind of necessity for going thither sometimes.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently the &#x201C;passing thought&#x201D; mentioned in <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420326-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-03-26">26 March</date></ref>.</note> Corson I think will require to <pb id="pg-14-80" n="14:80"/>be put away at any rate&#x2014;at least I will threaten him with that; and put him into Adamson&#x2019;s hands with stricter conditions. He does not even pay his rent well; and he too is trampling about in the woods.&#x2014; But there is time enough for reconsidering this, which is yet not many hours old.</p>
<p>No letter from you, of course, today; but I shall surely hear a word tomorrow. Poor old Mary Mills goes off every morning about 8, cannot get back till 10; she is ready to run in any and in all directions, poor old creature; and Margaret<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hiddlestone.</note> says she is &#x201C;grand company, an excellent well-living woman.&#x201D; Margaret herself must have been a blessing,&#x2014;alas, alas, we little knew! Another wretched creature applies to me today, who was here for two days and then set off; Mrs Russell is much to be thanked.&#x2014; That came at noon from Sterling.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling&#x2019;s letter of sympathy to TC, <date when="1842-03-19">19 March</date>. He had written to JWC, <date when="1842-03-13">13 March</date>.</note> I was at Thornhill paying off some wrecks of accounts. So far as I know, there is now no penny owing to any mortal.&#x2014; Good night, dear Wife; I am for a little more walking this sunset. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, with my blessing.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Jamie is just gone away by the Hill road; we did not know till this morning by what road he would go. We were at Craigenputtoch yesterday; saw Corson, M&#x2019;Adam, and the grounds and houses. M&#x2019;Adam&#x2019;s cattle have been busy with the woods; he required a <foreign><hi rend="italic">shoring</hi></foreign> [scolding], the great two-legged <foreign>Stot</foreign> [bullock] that he is. Corson&#x2019;s establishment excels in dirt, dilapidation, and still, composed, putrescent ruin, all that I had before seen in the world. A man is appointed to meet me at your house on Wednesday come a week, for the purpose of getting slate &#x26;c repaired: I almost think it would be as well to turn Corson out;&#x2014;at all events I will write to him that the premises seem going faster to decay than if they were deserted and well locked. He has <foreign><hi rend="italic">middens</hi></foreign> [dunghills] on every side; skylight broken, never shoves up a window; cattle travelling past the front-door into the wood: in selling the place, the sight of him there with his dung and lazy desolation might discourage, to the extent of hundreds of pounds. The sluggard <pb id="pg-14-81" n="14:81"/><foreign>hash</foreign> [blockhead]; Poverty need not make a man an entire slut and brother of the dung-heap! I will put him into Adamson&#x2019;s hands at any rate, and bind him up to conditions.</p>
<p>The place here, I hope, will be got fairly off my hands altogether; the tenants of the land taking the houses too. What is to be done with the furniture we do not yet see. Jane got safe to London on friday night with her Cousin: there is no post today, and I have not yet heard farther.</p>
<p>The night-shirt had gone by another carrier than Watson;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Watson, Thornhill carrier; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281230-JWC-TC-01"><sic>4:438</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1828-12-30">30 Dec. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> it was lying safe here when we arrived on Saturday. It is a capital article, and fits altogether: thanks for it till better payment.</p>
<p>Laurie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Laurie; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371019-TC-JA-01"><sic>9:334</sic><corr>TC to JA, <date when="1837-10-19">19 Oct. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> has undertaken to cut the woods; James will probably hear of him by and by: but I suppose it will be but to put Adamson into this too, M&#x2019;Adam being such a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Stot</hi></foreign>, and given to contend about nothings.</p>
<p>Tomorrow week then, if not sooner, you will see me if all go right,&#x2014;probably by one of the coaches.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Good b&#x2019;ye, dear Sister: commend me to James and the children. I have got a pound of tobacco from Glasgow, but still no pipes!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Wife,</salute>
<p>Your packet, and good long Letter, arrived this morning; poor Mary by a violent exertion of speed made shift to have it here a little after ten o&#x2019;clock: half past eight is their time of opening the post-office; she is most slow but most assiduous. There came a very short Note from John, accusing me of shortness. You must not get impatient with him: his own life and affairs grow all in such a whirling drift-mould, ever-shifting like desert sand, that whatsoever of good is in him, and of sympathy with one&#x2019;s affliction most of all, shews itself more imperfectly than in almost any other man. I have answered Chadwick&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edwin Chadwick.</note> Letter; I will write to Mrs Stanger about poor Calvert&#x2019;s memorial.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. John Mitchinson Calvert. Mrs. Stanger was his only sister. Perhaps the memorial was connected with Sterling&#x2019;s epitaph for him; see Fox 149&#x2013;50.</note> Did I not tell you that I had written to Cavaignac about ten days ago? Ask Mazzini farther about his illness: if that report confirm itself, I must write again.</p>
<p>Today the younger Jardine called upon me; another man from Shaws, an <foreign><hi rend="italic">emeritus</hi></foreign> Farmer named Irving, had called an hour before, also about the House; whom I had dismissed with a denial as to this place, and with a reference to Craigenputtoch if he were out of houses. Jardine&#x2019;s demeanour was that of a solid young man, who had minutely computed all his own purchase-money but had left out of view entirely the values of his ware: I explained to him, not without sharpness, that I meant this offer to him as a favour, and even as a considerable favour; and that if he could not accept it as such there was no farther negociation needed between us. Whereupon he fell away; acceded to everything; was to come again on friday evening, after I had got Moffat&#x2019;s word, and be prepared with his <foreign><hi rend="italic">finale</hi></foreign>. The poor people <pb id="pg-14-83" n="14:83"/>here have such a talent for spinning out business, and transact everything not with the fewest possible words but with the most possible. Their greediness is great; to their experienced caution plaindealing has an air that they suspect. On the whole perhaps Moffat would be the better man. But we shall see on friday; and meanwhile I need not trouble you with that. I dismissed poor Jardine with a glass of whisky, and some regret perhaps on both sides that he <supplied>[had]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> shown himself of such a wide recipience. Poor man!&#x2014; I had already three or four other Letters about Craigenputtoch &#x26;c; afterwards I walked across to Closeburn Hall,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Home of the Menteaths.</note> to pay my call there;&#x2014;not at home. Dinner, a bit of mutton boiled, was ready at my return; and now I am writing to you. That is hitherto the history of my day. A messenger (Jardine, accidentally) is over at Thornhill even now, and there may still be a letter from your Uncle. I may perhaps call on the Russels this evening, if I walk over with this myself: I have seen none of them for a week. I sent the Newspaper over to poor old Mr Dobie (a very good old man),<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. Edward Dobbie, Mary Russell&#x2019;s father.</note> with my compliments, this morning. I will attend to the work-table and fire-screens. Mr Russel well deserves our gratitude, so far as I can find; the thought that in difficulties there was one honest kind friend here is consolatory.</p>
<p>The little black book-case in this room shall be well taken care of. The carpets can easily come; the stair-carpets too, tho&#x2019; they are now much broken the drawingroom chairs and sofa&#x2014;we will try to do our best in. Shall I bring <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the blankets, sheets &#x26;c? If you can learn by Helen&#x2019;s List which I sent yesterday, pray instruct me by and by. We can take a little time. The truth is I am not yet at all familiar with the contents of the house,&#x2014;and have to believe, what there is indeed no doubt of that poor Margaret is perfectly honest; yet gradually I am getting acquainted, will make myself acquainted.</p>
<p>Helen spoke about some Miss Gillespie<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> at Moffat, who might have some small Book given her. Would you have it so? She also repeatedly suggested the question Whether Mrs M&#x2019;vey<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> ought not to have perhaps the picture of <hi rend="italic">the Cottar&#x2019;s Saturday Night</hi> which hangs over the drawing-room mantel-piece?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An engraving of the &#x201C;Cotter&#x2019;s Saturday Night,&#x201D; by John Rogers from a drawing by J.

I mean to call there, but only once shortly before my departure. <pb id="pg-14-84" n="14:84"/>I met Creighton<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Major Thomas Crichton (d. <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), the Duke of Buccleuch&#x2019;s chief factor in the area, widower of an old friend of Grace Welsh; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370304-JWC-JWE-01"><sic>9:161</sic><corr>JWC to JWE, <date when="1837-03-04">4 March 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> today, and bowed to him but in his carriage he did not seem to know me.</p>
<p>The Day has been pale-bright, serene,&#x2014;a sort of Sabbath to me, once my wrangling and letter-writing was done. The Closeburn trees were all loud with rooks; the cattle seemed happy; the unfathomable azure resting beautiful above us all. One asks is man alone born to sorrow that has neither healing nor blessedness in it? All Nature from all corners of it answers, No,&#x2014;for all the wise No; only Yea for the <hi rend="italic">un</hi>wise, who have man&#x2019;s susceptivities, appetites, capabilities, and not the insights and rugged virtues of men.</p>
<p>The sun is down; twilight itself, coming thro&#x2019; this poor North window which you know so well, begins to fail me. I must end.</p>
<p>One of my little works today was to copy this other essay of an inscription,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the gravestone.</note> of which your Uncle also has a copy. Return it with what criticisms you have. A man waits to do it so soon as we have fixed. Or would you rather not criticize it at all, but leave it to my responsibility? Write to me, at any rate; write to me a little, it will do you good: never mind how brief, how hasty.</p>
<p>Will you bid John pay the Hatter in the King&#x2019;s Road<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Spence, 38 King&#x2019;s Rd., Chelsea.</note> for my new hat? It will be perhaps a guinea; perhaps a shilling or two more; it wants a slight alteration. Or perhaps it were better if some of you asked for his bill, and signified that he <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be paid, at my return.</p>
<p>The little table here I have already, at Mrs Martin&#x2019;s suggestion, offered to your Uncle by letter: I offered him by word of mouth the poor old desk<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the end of the letter A. Carlyle has noted: &#x201C;It became Carlyle&#x2019;s and is now mine; I am now writing on it. A. C.&#x201D;</note> which was his Father&#x2019;s, but he not unreasonably as I thought declined it.</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear little Wife. Go out into the air when the sun shines; get a drive, Jeannie and you,&#x2014;and be good to one another. My Love to Cousin Jeannie. <closer><salute>Good night, Dearest.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your briefest of Notes arrived yesterday, for some time expected. It is Pot accusing Kettle when you complain of my &#x201C;shortness&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial. John replied, <date when="1842-03-26">26 March</date>: &#x201C;The brevity of my letters, which you justly retort, arises mainly from the nature of my occupation, isolated &#x26; dull, which does not admit of being much spoken of with edification.&#x201D;</note> is it not? Rowland Hill, I think, serves at present no briefer man!</p>
<p>The truth is, I have endless things to do, and to consider of doing, here; and till the last two days, have never been left an hour alone. I am also far out of health; in a very inflammatory bilious state; tho&#x2019; the country, I suppose, will gradually recover me again. I hurt my left arm too, climbing out of Scotsbrig Linn [ravine], the branch my foot was on suddenly giving way.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-86" n="14:86"/>All was pretty well at Scotsbrig; our good Mother only complaining of sore eyes, and of the remains of some biliary attack, which indeed I imagine was the origin of the former complaint. She talked of coming up hither; but, I doubt, the solitude will not suit her well. She charged me to say, with her blessings to you, that she could not afford to go without Letters from you, but should be obliged for even a short one. Pray write to her; it is one of her chief comforts; I have written at some length this very morning.</p>
<p>Jamie on Saturday brought me up by the Gill. The Austins are diligent and prospering well; poor Jenny has trimmed up her melancholy establishment in the end of their house in an almost pathetic way. She would like to stay there another year; but is at present by no means on the right footing with the Austins,&#x2014;who wish her there; and yet do not wish her, as is very natural; and talk accordingly. I employed her and Jamie to ascertain with distinctness, whether they would acept some rent from her for their two little rooms; otherwise she would have to leave them. It had been almost settled that she was to go to one of the houses at Ecclefechan;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Owned by their mother; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320522-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:161</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-05-22">22 May 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> but this, except as it brought her near our Mother, had great objections in her eyes, and in mine and Jean&#x2019;s. Failing Austindom, however, I conjecture it will be her lot. I encouraged her to try some little shop or the like; she looked glad; but appeared still to have her chief hope fixed on Rob, tho&#x2019; with sad misgivings. One could not but be very sorry for her.&#x2014; Jean, at Dumfries, and her people were well. Jamie and I arrived here, after various showers and blasts, about nine O&#x2019;clock.</p>
<p>On Monday, which was windy and bleared <supplied>[dimly]</supplied>-bright, we went to Craigenputtoch. I shall never forget that desolate gray expanse of Moor, beshone by the pale March Sun, in its utter loneliness; nor the brutal scene of sloth I found in Corsondom as located in the House that was ours. Dunghills and cattle-paths in front of the house; dung on all hands; rotten paling, not so much as burnt; mildewed paint, blown slates, bushy neglected hedges, rags, dirt, composed putrescent sloth and desolation looked on you from this side and that. Poor Corson, born brother of the Dungheap! I have written since to say that I must turn him out, or reform him,&#x2014;of which latter what possibility is there? M&#x2019;Adams grounds looked not so ill, except that his dikes were down, that his cattle had been scandalously preying on the woods; for which fault, and his defences of it, I had to rebuke and even to menace him, the senseless two-legged <foreign>Stot</foreign> that he is. Order must be taken about all that: on Wednesday next I go to Dumfries for the purpose.&#x2014; Glen, whom we saw for some minutes in returning, <pb id="pg-14-87" n="14:87"/>eagerly inquired your address, which I said you would send him in writing. He seemed vainer if anything, and more insane than ever, hopelessly insane. I gave him the brass tobacco-box, and went my way.</p>
<p>It will I fear be two weeks or three before I get all settled here, and Templand finally off my hands. Jane will apprize you how I get on if you know not otherwise. Pray be good and kind to her, poor woman. She has got a wound which has cut her to the heart. The virtues of her Mother, what her Mother essentially was, are now first visible when the poor earthly obstructed <hi rend="italic">coating</hi> of them has become dead earth, and all is ended! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>Accept a little word again today. Your Letter was hardly gone by Mary Mills for Thornhill, when by another route the dilatory Jardine brought this which I enclose from your uncle.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC enclosed Robert M&#x2019;Queen&#x2019;s note to John Welsh, from Crawford, <date when="1842-03-15">15 March</date>, with information about the Welsh tombstone: &#x201C;Jean Welsh youngest / Daughter of Walter Welsh died / on the <date when="1828-03-31">thirty-first of March / Eighteen hundred and / Twenty-eight</date>. &#x2026; The above is the same as linid [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] on the stone in Crawford Churchyard&#x2014;and when the man comes he had better call on M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Cranston &#x26; he will direct him to the place.&#x201D;</note> So soon as you return the Inscription approved, I will set forward in it. I called on the Russells in my moonlight walk. Their still, low room, the good old Dobie and his good Daughter affected me beneficently: a very warm elderly woman in black sat there also, and said nothing; the assiduous Dr exerted himself to talk: seeing symptoms of supper-preparations I took my leave.</p>
<p>Today the post hitherto yields nothing, save a Dumfries Courier, in which I notice the sudden death of Archdeacon Singleton, at Alnwick,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Singleton (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25645"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), archdeacon of Northumberland, d. <date when="1842-03-13">13 March</date>.

Alnwick is 37 mi. N of Newcastle.</note> apparently by apoplexy. Death&#x2019;s shafts fly thick.</p>
<p>Morton-Mill, as they call him, has this morning sent over poor old Charles<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Hunter of Morton Mill. Old Charles is unidentified.</note> to fetch the weatherglass; I enclose his Note: the poor man, when he reentered this room, seemed truly affected; the sight of him affected me.</p>
<p>I have written to Mrs Stanger. Also to MacDiarmid,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M&#x2019;Diarmid (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>), ed. and owner of the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier;</hi> see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210110-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:307</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-01-10">10 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> about a Tenant <pb id="pg-14-88" n="14:88"/>for Craigenputtoch House. Nothing will come of that, I believe; but it seemed worth trying. I have summoned Corson to meet me next Wednesday at Dumfries, with a &#x201C;slater,&#x201D; whose services are needed. I have also appointed to see Stewart of Gillenbie then; and others.</p>
<p>Margaret tells me this morning there is a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> stair-carpet and lobby-carpet (the old indeed is nearly done); made, I suppose, partly by <hi rend="italic">her</hi> hands: this of course we will retain too; the other can be given to some one. The stool you spoke of is the little mahogany round one with three legs, which was once ours? There are some three others in different parts of the house, all with traces of her about them; none of these either shall be sold.&#x2014; Alas, what a day or two my poor Jeannie must have had, opening of these boxes: This, then, is all that I now have of my blessed Mother; woe is me!&#x2014; My poor Darling, how can I say that it is not sad, a thing worthy of tears wrung from the very heart? God comfort thee.</p>
<p>A certain Mrs Black<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified.</note> some kind of connexion, living about Cluden Bridge, speaks of wishing to purchase the Cow &#x201C;by private bargain&#x201D;: if she seems to mean honestly when I speak with her, she shall be preferred.</p>
<p>Business goes on with horrible slowness in this region. One of my chief <hi rend="italic">businesses</hi> must be to expedite it, what I can. If I have to stay for any time, I will endeavour after some work of my own, and then be patienter of slowness.</p>
<p>Take care of thy health, dear Wife; I charge Jeannie to take thee out into the sunshine. Get one of Nodes&#x2019;s<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Nodes, livery stable, 21 New Manor St., Chelsea; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390505-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>11:94</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1839-05-05">5 May 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> flyes and drive out fairly into the country,&#x2014;do this; the sight of God&#x2019;s green ground will do you good. The Wandsworth ride is eligible; still more so Dulwich, Norwood and that South-eastern region on the same side of the river. If Mrs Rich be coming soon, you may wait till she also be there, if you like that better&#x2014; Jeannie Welsh of Liverpool, I commit this <hi rend="italic">to thee;</hi> see that it be done, and when there is sunshine, my good Cousin!</p>
<p><closer><salute>And so <foreign>adieu</foreign> my poor Goody for this day. I am to walk towards Morton-Mill; with the chance not with the certainty of finding Hunter there. It will be a walk at any rate. God&#x2019;s blessing on you, and comfort from the everlasting Fountain of such. Your affectionate,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>My dear good Wife,&#x2014;</salute> Your kind and sad little Note arrived this morning. Never mind me and my health; the country with its sacred stillness and freshness is sure to amend me of everything; its very tempests and blustering spring-showers do me good to witness. <hi rend="italic">God&#x2019;s</hi> earth! It is good for me, also, to be left quite alone here, alone with my griefs and my sins,&#x2014;ever as in the presence of one sainted and gone into the Eternal Clearness: God Most High is over us both.</p>
<p>This morning I hear from Adamson about some legacy-tax and the Inventory of effects; I have taken order about it, and answered him: to you this only will be interesting, that she had (if I recollect) &#xa3;189 lying in the Bank,&#x2014;so needed not to fear money-straits at least. Heaven be praised for it. O Jeannie what a blessing for us now that we fronted poverty instead of her doing it! Could the Queen&#x2019;s Treasury compensate us, had we basely left her to such a struggle.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date> JWC had made over to her mother the Haddington house and rent of Craigenputtoch; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250719-JBW-GW-01"><sic>3:352&#x2013;54</sic><corr>JBW to GW, <date when="1825-07-19">19 July 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Moffat has just been here; again about that House, which also I had an immense talk with Hunter yesterday concerning; who is to come again today, and then Jardine is to come again! There is no end to these people&#x2019;s quantity of talk. We are all four to meet tomorrow at noon, in Moffat&#x2019;s house at Thornhill, and <hi rend="italic">there</hi> and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> settle it, if it exceed not human power. It seems to me likeliest that this Moffat, who is a good little fellow, of gentlemanly ways, will get the House, and continue Jardine as he before stood; but for poor Jardine too I mean to insist on a small advantage, such as <hi rend="italic">she</hi> had contemplated for him, or an equivalent to such. There is also, it seems, indispensably needful some sort of application from me to &#x201C;the Duke&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Buccleuch, from whom Templand was leased, about the subletting.</note> this also, after boggling at it for some time, I have put in readiness. One way or other I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be thro&#x2019; this poor business, and end all talk and thought about it before I be many days or hours older.</p>
<p>This morning I packed up the poor little chair for Scotsbrig; the sight of it standing here, with its poor little cover (I think, an old dressing-gown of yours), made me sad: it is packed, out of my sight, and waits a conveyance to Thornhill  I added <hi rend="italic">her</hi> Psalm-Book, which she had got from old Mrs Scott at Haddington; and two small religious volumes, unbound, which had no mark of her, <hi rend="italic">Baxter</hi> and <pb id="pg-14-90" n="14:90"/><hi rend="italic">Doddridge</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Scott not further identified. Probably Richard Baxter, <hi rend="italic">The Saints Everlasting Rest</hi> (<date when="1650-00-00">1650</date>) and Philip Doddridge, <hi rend="italic">The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul</hi> (<date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>).</note>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; The old Backgammon Board I think I must give to R. M&#x2019;Queen; who has already had a Book or two once mine (the German Romance, and two odd American Miscellanies, not good enough for Mrs Russell&#x2019;s stock), for which he seemed very thankful. The little round dumb-waiter does not appear to be in the house now; or I would have snatched it carefully. There is an old School-<hi rend="italic">collection</hi> here, which seems once to have been W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Welsh&#x2019;s;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s paternal uncle, the sixth Welsh brother (b. <date when="1790-04-14">14 April 1790</date>), d.

Your Picture was packed up by mistake of Mrs Martin or Helen: it now belongs to me.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either the portrait of JWC as a girl, noted in <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s House Catalogue</hi> as having been in the first-floor drawing room (see A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi> 1:frontispiece), or the Kenneth Macleay miniature, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>, noted as in TC&#x2019;s bedroom (see A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi> 2:frontispiece).</note></p>
<p>The rain has begun falling again; or perhaps I should not have written at present. I will now take my Mackintosh and out before the time come for the mutton-chop. With the people coming, I shall run the risk to get no walking at all otherwise.</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, then, Dearest. If anything be settled tomorrow, you will of course hear of it. Tell me next time that you have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> sleep; I pray you may be able! Those melancholy packages may linger for days; compose yourself to front them. My love to Cousin Jeannie. <closer><salute>Your affectionate Husband</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I wrote that the little Chair would be sent; the little Chair, <hi rend="italic">with some</hi> <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>, is all packed, and ready; but now it seems there is no way of getting it sent over to Thornhill, except first going <pb id="pg-14-91" n="14:91"/>oneself, warning the Watsons to come <hi rend="italic">with a cart</hi>, and then paying them a shilling! Wherefore we will let it wait till Wednesday; before which there will probably be a chance, or at all events there may be more things to carry for a <hi rend="italic">cart</hi>.</p>
<p>I have a short Note from Jane this morning again: she is in some agitation about her poor Mother&#x2019;s things being all now to arrive,&#x2014;alas, no Mother can arrive more! She had not slept, on that account, she says; but was otherwise going on as before.</p>
<p>Jamie&#x2019;s Letter came this morning; thank him for it, and for all his promptitude in serving me.</p>
<p>The Mr Moffat Banker in Thornhill has just been here; and I think it is he that will likeliest get the house. We are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> to meet, tomorrow at noon at Thornhill, Moffat Jardine, Hunter and I, and it shall go hard but we will then come to some kind of bargain.</p>
<p>The rain has begun again: the last two days were too bright to last.</p>
<p>Are you thinking about coming up to me, rude as the weather is?</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There seems some indispensable necessity for some personal application on my part to the Duke of Buccleuch, before a certain very small transaction now in progress here can complete itself.</p>
<p>Will you have the kindness to transmit the accompanying Statement to His Grace, with your verification of the facts; or your correction, if on any point I have been mistaken.</p>
<p>Mr Moffat and Jardine, with whom Mr Hunter and I conversed at great length today, failed of an arrangement mutually agreeable; whereupon Mr Moffat with great politeness and goodnature withdrew from the negociation.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir.</salute>
<p>We learn by the Newspapers that you everywhere in America stir up the question of International Copyright, and thereby awaken huge dissonance where all else were triumphant unison for you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dickens had reminded his American hearers that books by British authors were constantly reprinted in America without copyright payment, and that the same was true of American authors in Britain. But it was not the most propitious moment to raise the question, as big-city newspapers had taken to pirating popular new works, and the press retaliated.</note> I am asked my opinion of the matter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Forster to whom Dickens had written, <date when="1842-02-24">24 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;I should like to have a short letter addressed to me, by the principal English authors who signed the international copyright petition, expressive of their sense that I have done my duty to the cause. &#x2026; Publication in the best journals here would unquestionably do great good&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 3:86).</note> and requested to write it down in words.</p>
<p>Several years ago, if memory err not, I was one of many English Writers who, under the auspices of Miss Martineau, did sign a petition to Congress, praying for an International Copyright between the Two Nations<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The petition, prepared by Harriet Martineau and her publishers Saunders &#x26; Otley, and signed by fifty-six British authors, requested congress to give them the right to payment for publication of their works in the U.S. Henry Clay (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>), whig leader in the senate and the strongest advocate of international copyright in congress, presented the petition to the senate, <date when="1837-02-02">2 Feb. 1837</date>. Dickens told Forster that &#x201C;Clay has already sent a gentleman to me express from Washington &#x2026; to declare his strong interest in the matter, his cordial approval of the &#x2018;manly&#x2019; course I have held in reference to it, and his desire to stir in it if possible&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 3:86).<sic>in this respect is, without the abatement of one jot or atom, mine&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 3:213).</sic></note>&#x2014;which, properly, are not Two Nations, but one&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">indivisible</hi> by Parliament, Congress, or any kind of Human Law or Diplomacy; being already united by Heaven&#x2019;s Act of Parliament, and the Everlasting Law of Nature and Fact. To that opinion I still adhere, and am like to continue adhering.</p>
<p>In discussion of the matter before any Congress or Parliament, manifold considerations and argumentations will necessarily arise; which to me are not interesting, nor essential for helping me to a decision. They respect the time and manner in which the thing should be; not at all whether the thing should be, or not. In an ancient Book, reverenced I should hope on both sides of the ocean, it was Thousands <pb id="pg-14-93" n="14:93"/>of Years ago, written down in the most decisive and explicit manner, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Thou Shalt not Steal</hi>&#x201D;.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Exod. 20:15.</note> That thou belongest to a different &#x201C;Nation&#x201D; and canst steal without being certainly hanged for it, gives thee no permission to steal. Thou shalt not in anywise steal at all! So it is written down for Nations and for Men, in the Law Book of the Maker of this Universe. Nay, poor Jeremy Bentham<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s opinion of Jeremy Bentham (<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), philosopher of utilitarianism, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310120-TC-MN-01"><sic>5:211&#x2013;12</sic><corr>TC to MN, <date when="1831-01-20">20 Jan. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> and others step in here, and will demonstrate that it is actually our true convenience and expediency not to steal; which I for my share, on the great scale and on the small, and in all conceivable scales and shapes, do also firmly believe it to be. For example, if Nations abstained from stealing, what need were there of fighting&#x2014;with its butcherings and burnings: decidedly the most expensive thing in this World? How much more two Nations which, as I said, are but one Nation, knit in a thousand ways by Nature and Practical Intercourse; indivisible brother elements of the same great SAXONDOM, to which, in all honorable ways, be long life!</p>
<p>When Mr Robert Roy M&#x2019;Gregor<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1671-00-00">1671</date>&#x2013;<date when="1734-00-00">1734</date>), highland freebooter; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390610-TC-JF-01"><sic>11:127</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1839-06-10">10 June 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> lived in the district of Menteith on the Highland Border, Two Centuries ago, he, for his part, found it more convenient to supply himself with beef by stealing it alive from the adjacent glens, than by buying it killed in the Stirling butchers&#x2019; Market. It was Mr Roy&#x2019;s plan of supplying himself with beef in those days, this of stealing it. In many a little &#x201C;Congress&#x201D; in the district of Menteith there was debating, doubt it not, and much specious argumentation this way and that, before they could ascertain that, really and truly, buying was the best way to get your beef; which, however, in the long run, they did with one assent find it indisputably to be: and accordingly they hold by it to this day.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On receiving TC&#x2019;s letter, with a memorial on international copyright signed by twelve British authors and their joint letter, Dickens wrote to the eds. of various leading newspapers, including the Boston <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi>, New York <hi rend="italic">Evening Post</hi>, New York <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, and Washington <hi rend="italic">National Intelligencer</hi>, on <date when="1842-04-27">27 April</date> asking them to publish the documents &#x201C;in order that the People of America may understand that the sentiments I have expressed on all public occasions since I have been in these United States, in reference to a law of International Copyright, are not merely my individual sentiments, but are, without any qualification, abatement or reserve, the opinions of the great body of British authors. &#x2026; I would beg to lay particular stress upon the letter from Mr. Carlyle, not only because the plain and manly Truth it speaks is calculated, I should conceive, to arrest attention and respect in any country, and most of all in this; but because his creed <corr>in this respect is, without the abatement of one jot or atom, mine&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 3:213).</corr> The memorial and the letter to Dickens, both of <date when="1842-03-28">28 March</date>, were signed by Bulwer, Thomas Campbell, Tennyson, Talfourd, Hood, Leigh Hunt, Henry Hallam, Sydney Smith, Henry Hart Milman, Rogers, Forster, and Bryan Waller Procter.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>The Inclosed<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420326-TC-CHDI-01">preceding letter</ref> to Dickens.</note> I have written in the greatest haste, without time to make a rough draught or any copy of it: judge you whether it should go to its address or not. Dickens deserves praise and support: but the claims of Authors seem to me so infinitely beyond what anybody rates them at, or what any Congress will hear of, that I can seldom speak of them without either getting into banter, or a tone inconveniently <hi rend="italic">loud</hi>, which is worse. Congress will evidently throw out this proposal, and the next, and the next, and babble of the thing for many years,&#x2014;and then do it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not till the Chace Act, <date when="1891-00-00">1891</date>, did British authors have effective copyright protection in the U.S.</note> We are all right to shorten the <hi rend="italic">years</hi> as we can.</p>
<p>I know Willesden<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Suburb of London, 4 mi. NW of Hyde Park Corner.</note> well; my present solitude is not less beautiful, Scottish in character, with the addition of rushing streams,&#x2014;and all, as you may fancy, made very solemn and sad to me by the late event. My poor Wife seems to suffer terribly; her feelings are at once vehement and tenacious: alas, her good Mother is no more, a woman whose very faults (excesses of virtue, all of them that I ever knew) render her more lovable now!&#x2014; Pray call at Chelsea if you can.</p>
<p>This day I have spent two &#x201C;stricken hours,&#x201D; babbling in Scotch with two men,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Moffat and Jardine.</note> that they might agree to <hi rend="italic">divide amicably</hi> a charitable boon I offered between them. Their mutual greediness rendered it <pb id="pg-14-95" n="14:95"/>impossible; we shall have to try it yet again, or think of new measures. Conceive it: my pen goes <hi rend="italic">next</hi>, after I quit you, to the inditing of a Memorial to the Duke of Buccleuch about subletting &#x26;c of a Farm and House! It will be two or three weeks yet before I get away from these confusions.</p>
<p>Last night was such a &#x201C;rocking wind&#x201D; as I have hardly ever heard. Trees lie uprooted this morning, slates blown, and farm-ricks scattered into individual straws. I sat reading a despicable Life of Hildebrand,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Sir Roger Greisley, <hi rend="italic">The Life and Pontificate of Gregory the Seventh</hi> (<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>).

<p>This will probably come to you just along with the other Note of yesterday; for I reflected last (as <hi rend="italic">we</hi> had already too dolefully experienced) that Friday was the blank London night at Thornhill. I will not let the day pass, however, without one word to you.</p>
<p>Dear Jeannie, you are evidently very ill; I entreat you take care of yourself, do not tear yourself in pieces!&#x2014; As to Craigenputtoch that was a passing thought, and has come no more back:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420322-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-03-22">22 March</date></ref>.</note> if I make <hi rend="italic">you</hi> miserable, it shall be for a greater blessedness to myself than a residence there, among the savages! Dismiss that.</p>
<p>I have again talked two hours with these Candidates for the House. The greedy mortals, especially the greedy Jardine (whom, however, I pity) cannot agree; wherefore Moffat is off, or affects to be off. Hunter thinks perhaps Jardine will accede still to our proposal, when he has had time to reflect. My wish is, and my determination with whatever trouble, is to leave the place as I think <hi rend="italic">she</hi> would have wished it left, with the odour of a charitable and reasonable last-act in her name <pb id="pg-14-96" n="14:96"/>there. I have made out my Memorial to the Duke; I have also written to Dickens and Forster about this American &#x201C;International Copyright&#x201D;;&#x2014;so heterogeneous are my affairs.</p>
<p>Last night we had as loud a wind-storm as I ever heard. Much damage is done; and some slates &#x26;c blown out here.&#x2014; I have <hi rend="italic">castor</hi> in me, and hope to get well now. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Lockhart,</salute>
<p>An event has occurred here, of which, tho&#x2019; it can only concern you thro&#x2019; me, I think I should apprise you. My poor wife&#x2019;s Mother, Mrs Welsh of this place, has been unexpectedly called away by death. She was a person of much generosity and worth; whose very frailties and failings, being, as they were, all <hi rend="italic">virtues</hi> in a state of obstruction and terrene imprisonment, now make one love her more; now that the imprisonment has broken down, and all has melted into clearness and Eternity! My Wife, her only Daughter and Child, has returned to Chelsea; her Letters still betoken extreme misery and disconsolation.</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh was a Widow, and her Father had died here, and before him her Sister: this establishment is now to be abandoned and terminated. You can fancy what all that will mean for me. Rough country businesses, with the poor passions and avidities of rustic men occupy me for a part of every day: I keep myself all alone otherwise; alone with the old Hills and Rivers, with God&#x2019;s Universe and the Spirits of the Dead. I am to be here yet, I suppose, for a matter of three weeks. You need not write to me; send me a friendly thought in silence.</p>
<p>It is often far longer than this that I do not see you: but I feel as if, were I within four miles of you at present, not even London should keep me from exchanging a few words with a thinking man. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>. I remain</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>An event has occurred here, of which it seems to me you ought to be apprised. My poor Mother-in-law, Mrs Welsh of this place, was unexpectedly called away by death, on the <date when="1842-02-25">25<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> of last month. We had no intimat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> or suspicion of her danger; she had been complaining, but was often sickly, and treated this, and taught us to treat it, as a mere common illness. Our first alarm was from the Doctor on the very day when death followed. Her only Daughter and Child was then sick at Chelsea; but started instantly, in a paroxysm of hope and fear; travelling all night, she was met at her Uncle&#x2019;s door in Liverpool on the morrow morning, by the news that all had already ended. She stopped there. She is now home again at Chelsea, with one of her cousins to nurse her; the tone of her Letters is still full of misery.</p>
<p>I am here ever since this day three weeks; entirely alone for the last week. Multiplicities of sad rustic business are to be arranged; for this establishment is to be concluded, and lies suddenly all round me in ruins,&#x2014;like an arch with its keystone suddenly struck out. I fear I shall be detained here some three weeks yet.</p>
<p>I send you many kind thoughts across the Frith, and these sad tidings, having none better. You need not write till I get back to London.</p>

I pray you study to avoid <hi rend="italic">whatever</hi> can lead thitherward: and know well always that I cannot deliberately mean anything that is harmful to you, unjust <pb id="pg-14-98" n="14:98"/>or painful to you,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">in</hi>deliberately I do enough of such things without meaning them.</p>
<p>Today has been one of the most perfectly silent days I ever spent; a very Sabbath. At one time I meant to inspect the Wardrobe, at least to put the new-washed things into it; but, for this, I needed Margaret&#x2019;s services and would not teach her to break the Sabbath. I wrote out the Inscription,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the Welsh tombstone.</note> and on the other side of the Paper even printed it, that the man, whom I shall see tomorrow might not at all mistake.&#x2014; Craik had sent me a long Letter about very little; this I briefly answered.</p>
<p>I walked three hours in the grey March mildness down to the Ford or Ferry of Barjarg and back again by the River side and Shaws. It was a road I more than once went good part of on horseback that Autumn we last tried to stay here.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>.</note> Alas, how all the faults and little infirmities of the Departed seem now, what they really were, mere <hi rend="italic">virtues imprisoned;</hi> obstructed in the strange sensitive tremulous element they were sent to live in! Of that once more I could not but think today. There is something in these remembrances that would drive one to weeping!&#x2014; Templand in the distance looked to me like a kind of pure Hades and Shrine of the Dead: poor little Auntie&#x2019;s figure lying in death in it, and then in succession the Second and now the Third!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The deaths of Grace Welsh&#x2019;s youngest sister Jeannie (<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>), her father, Walter Welsh (<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321202-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:266&#x2013;67</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-12-02">2 Dec. 1832</date></corr></ref>), and Grace Welsh.</note> The rooks were cawing all round, the River rushing ever on; a sacred silence of all human sounds rested far and wide. It is very mournful to me, but preferable to anything that could be offered me of the sort they call joy.</p>
<p>Poor Sterling; setting off tomorrow again, on his old hapless errand!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Sterling was leaving Falmouth for Gibraltar, Malta, and Naples in search of health.</note> And yet who knows whether at bottom it is not a kind of good to him. Were it not for this sickness that always opens an issue, I see not but that he must either write a Tragedy, or failing that, break his heart, and so act one.&#x2014; Probably he himself is not without some unconscious feeling of that sort, which in the background may lie as a kind of consolation to him.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had written, <date when="1842-03-19">19 March</date>: &#x201C;All things are so diminished &#x26; distracted by ever recurring illness&#x2014;soon to end before very long in a final crushing that few thoughts abide with me deeply but the vaguest and most dusty &#x26; specially the feeling that I neither have done nor can hope to do any thing of the much that once seemed possible.&#x201D; He did not mention his departure.</note> Poor fellow!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Old Mary has had her tea, and has scarcely more than time to get to Thornhill before eight; I must end. Perhaps I shall get nothing written tomorrow, for there will be much to do.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-99" n="14:99"/>The drawers in the wardrobe have a kind of fusty smell, like what my Desk used to have when I was a Boy at Annan School: I have scarcely felt the odour since? I think I will make Margaret take them all out and air them. She is perfectly punctual and honest, I believe.&#x2014; The wardrobe is a huge thing; and does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come in two pieces. You will have to put away one of the old chests of Drawers, I suppose.</p>
<p>Enough now; and good night to Cousin Jeannie and you, from the loneliest man in all the world, or as lonely as any! <closer><salute>Good night, and a blessing be with you.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Wife,</salute>
<p>As you will hardly hear from me tomorrow, seeing I have to go down to Dumfries, and the next day (Wednesday then) is also uncertain, I will still send a line tonight. Your Letter of this morning is far from cheering; I see you are still very poorly, and the weather does not allow you to get out. I wish I could change the weather; I wish I could do anything to assuage your sick feelings a little either from without or from within! Alas, I can do nothing: a silly word or two scribbled on paper, that is all I can manage for you at present. It rains here today again, and the whole world is dreary: Courage, we must rouse ourselves against dispiritment, and refuse to give way to sorrow! Sorrow is a disease; we are to work and not to sorrow.</p>
<p>At Thornhill where I spent this forenoon I strove to make out something. M&#x2019;Caig is to get me a new complete list of everything here (he already took one as an official appraiser, which is gone to the tax-office); I will then eliminate from it all the articles that are to be kept, and so be ready for the Auctioneer, whom perhaps I shall still call upon tonight. M&#x2019;Caig is a useful respectable kind of man. He will be useful to me in settling (about grates and other <hi rend="italic">fixtures</hi>) with the pig Jardine,&#x2014;poor pig! I have not yet got any formal settlement about the House itself, till the Duke&#x2019;s answer to my Memorial come; but I can afford to waste no more time with their babbling. The Letter-cutter is also to come over tonight to take my final instructions. I will attend to Mrs Black and the Cow.&#x2014; After business done, I called on the Russells: Mrs R. is a good woman, her old Father a man I like much: his old eyes were full of tears today as he spoke of one that is gone. &#x201C;A generous-hearted <pb id="pg-14-100" n="14:100"/>woman, Sir; one that struggled always to be doing kindness.&#x201D; The faces of Margaret Hiddlestone and of these good people are among one&#x2019;s chief consolations in think<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> of her latter months here.</p>
<p>Poor Emerson&#x2019;s Letter too brings bad news; he has lost his eldest child, a very fine boy of five years. His calm speech on it is full of pathos.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1842-02-28">28 Feb.</date>, that his only son, Waldo, had d. of scarlatina. Two girls remained, of three years and three mos. old.</note> His Letters bring bills for me equal to &#xa3;56 and odd:&#x2014;money seems very mean in presence of great sorrow.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; John&#x2019;s Note which came this morning I enclose, as the envelope will hold it: he sent a dozen of cigars along with it. His account of you is far from satisfactory to me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John wrote, <date when="1842-03-26">26 March</date>: &#x201C;On Wednesday I was at Chelsea. Jane looked very pale and distressed. She has seen many of her friends since returning to London, but we have had no weather fit for her getting out of doors. The shock is indeed terrible for her ardent &#x26; compressed nature, &#x26; the worse too for having had a similar one from her father&#x2019;s death.&#x201D;</note> <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dearest; take care of yourself, take courage, and sink <hi rend="italic">deep</hi> into your own soul and you will there <hi rend="italic">find</hi> comfort: <hi rend="italic">deep</hi> in our souls is God.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Yours ever affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>This is heavy news that you send me; the heaviest outward bereavement that can befal a man has overtaken you. Your calm tone of deep quiet sorrow, coming in on the rear of poor trivial wordly businesses, all punctually dispatched and recorded too, as if the Higher and Highest had not been busy with you, tells me a sad tale. What can we say in these cases? There is nothing to be said,&#x2014;nothing but what the wild son of Ishmael<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the sons of Ishmael, see Gen. 25:13&#x2013;15.</note> and every thinking heart, from of old have learned to say: God is great! He is terrible and stern; but we know also He is good. &#x201C;Though He slay me yet will I trust in Him.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 13:15.</note> Your bright little Boy, chief of your possessions here below, is rapt away from you; but of very truth <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is with God, even as we that yet live are,&#x2014;and surely in the way that was <hi rend="italic">best</hi> for him and for you and for all of us.&#x2014; Poor Lidian Emerson, poor Mother! To her I have no word. Such poignant <pb id="pg-14-101" n="14:101"/>unspeakable grief, I believe, visits no creature as that of a Mother bereft of her child. The poor sparrow in the bush affects one with pity, mourning for its young; how much more the human soul of one&#x2019;s Friend! I cannot bid her be of comfort; for there is as yet no comfort. May good Influences watch over her, bring her some assuagement. As the Hebrew David said, &#x201C;we shall go to him, he will not return to us.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 Sam. 12:23.</note></p>
<p>I also am here in a house rendered vacant and sacred by Death. A sore calamity has fallen on us,&#x2014;or rather has fallen on my poor Wife (for what am I but like a spectator in comparison); she has lost unexpectedly her good Mother, her sole surviving Parent, and almost only relative of much value that was left to her. The manner too was almost tragic. We had heard of illness here, but only of commonplace illness, and had no alarm. The Doctor himself, specially applied to, made answer as if there was no danger: his poor Patient, in whose character the like of that intimately lay, had rigorously charged him to do so: her poor Daughter was far off, confined to her room by illness of her own; why alarm her, make her wretched? The danger itself did seem over; the Doctor accordingly obeyed. Our first intimation of alarm was despatched on the very day which proved the final one. My poor Wife casting sickness behind her got instantly ready, set off by the first railway train: travelling all night, on the morrow morning at her Uncle&#x2019;s door in Liverpool she is met by tidings that all is already ended. She broke down there; she is now home again at Chelsea, a cheery amiable younger Jane Welsh, to nurse her: the tone of her Letters is still full of disconsolateness. I had to proceed hither, and have to stay here till this establishment can be abolished, and all the sad wrecks of it in some seemly manner swept away. It is above three weeks that I have been here; not till eight days ago could I so much as manage to command solitude, to be left altogether alone. I lead a strange life; full of sadness, of solemnity, not without a kind of blessedness. I say it is right and fitting that one be left entirely alone now and then,&#x2014;alone with one&#x2019;s own griefs and sins, with the mysterious ancient Earth round one, the everlasting Heaven over one, and what one can make of these. Poor rustic businesses, subletting of Farms, disposal of houses, household goods: these strangely intervene, like matter upon spirit, every day;&#x2014;wholesome this too perhaps. It is many years since I have stood so in close contact face to face with the reality of Earth, with its haggard ugliness, its divine beauty, its depths of Death and of Life. Yesterday, one of the stillest Sundays, I sat long by the side of the swift river Nith; sauntered among woods all vocal only with rooks and pairing birds. The hills are often white with snow-powder, black brief <pb id="pg-14-102" n="14:102"/>spring-tempests rush fiercely down from them, and then again the sky looks forth with a pal<supplied>[e]</supplied> pure brightness,&#x2014;like Eternity from behind Time. The <hi rend="italic">sky</hi>, when one thinks of it, is <hi rend="italic">always</hi> blue, pure changeless azure; rains and tempests are only for the little dwellings where men abide. Let us think of this too. Think of this, thou sorrowing Mother! Thy Boy has escaped many showers.</p>
<p>In some three weeks I shall probably be back at Chelsea. Write thitherward so soon as you have opportunity; I will write again before long, even if I do not hear from you. The monies &#x26;c are all safe here as you describe: if Fraser&#x2019;s Executors make any demur, your Bookseller shall soon hear of it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had enclosed a bill of exchange for &#xa3;48 payable to Baring Brothers as part of a payment from Little &#x26; Brown for the London edns. of the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>. He also wrote, &#x201C;As another part of their payment they asked me if they might not draw on the Estate of James Fraser for a balance due from his house to them &#x26; pay you so&#x201D; (<date when="1842-02-28">28 Feb.</date>).</note></p>
<p>I had begun to write some Book on Cromwell: I have often begun, but know not how to set about it; the most unutterable of all subjects I ever felt much meaning to lie in. There is risk yet that, with the loss of still farther labour, I may have to abandon it;&#x2014;and then the great dumb Oliver may lie unspoken for ever: gathered to the mighty <hi rend="italic">Silent</hi> of the Earth; for, I think, there will hardly ever live another man that will believe in him and his Puritanism as I do. To <hi rend="italic">him</hi> small matter.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my good kind Friend, ever dear to me, dearer now in sorrow. My Wife when she hears of your affliction will send a true thought over to you also. The poor Lidian!&#x2014; John Sterling is driven off again, setting out I think this very day for Gibraltar Malta and Naples. Farewell, and better days to us.&#x2014; Your affectionate</salute></closer>  <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<dateline><place>Templand</place>, Monday Night, <date when="1842-03-28">28 March, 1842</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your kind little Note,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1842-03-26">26 March</date>.</note> thanks for your cigars; which arrived this morning before breakfast. I had a Letter too from Emerson in America,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1842-02-28">28 Feb.</date></note> conveying the melancholy news that he had lost his eldest child, a very fine boy of five years. His affliction is evidently great.&#x2014; There was inclosed in the same Letters (for in fact <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Letters came, <pb id="pg-14-103" n="14:103"/>both of the same date) a couple of draughts for about &#xa3;56,&#x2014;one of them for a small sum of &#xa3;8 was drawn on the &#x201C;Executors of James Fraser.&#x201D; Perhaps I may trouble you farther about that. Or perhaps they may be able to settle it at Dumfries; whither I am bound tomorrow, on a multiplicty of sorry affairs.</p>
<p>Negociations go on at a dreadfully slow rate here: I have had a &#x201C;Memorial&#x201D; to make out to your Duke before I could be allowed to dispose of the small Lease of Templand here: I am minded to give up House, Lease and all to the present subtenant<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jardine.</note> of the lands, whom I thought an industrious hardworking man, and made a really beneficent offer to, of letting him have the whole for &#xa3;100 ready-money, instead of a rent of &#xa3;15 for 14 years: the man proves a greedy pigheaded piece of obstinate absurdity, who might almost tempt me to draw back again. The disgust he inspires me with must not smother my true feelings of pity for him. Then there is an Auctioneer, whom I think to see tomorrow, before setting out; for I cannot haggle longer with these pigheaded rustics; I must proceed, on the faith that the Duke&#x2019;s permission <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come. Then there are packers, and carriers of &#x2018;several&#x2019; things for London. Then there is the dreary business of Craigenputtoch,&#x2014;to be attacked tomorrow and next day. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi!</hi></foreign> But in some three weeks or less, I hope to be thro&#x2019; it all: there is no course but to plunge on. I find I should like &#x201C;business&#x201D; now terribly ill. My whole mind is grown indolent, impatient of these small, most measurable things. Nay I am ashamed to see how indolent even in thought I have been for some years; how much I have left lying in me like a mere stagnant sea of emotions; never struggling adequately to change it into thought.</p>
<p>My life for the last eight days has been of the most perfect solitude: very sad, but not a morose sadness; wholesome, I think, and not without a kind of blessedness. This House, all vacant except of memories, all silent except for winds, is like a kind of solemn Hades to me; the whole world is little other than a Hades. The weather is oftenest bad, but it is weather, not smoke-confusion and city-dirt: the sun bursts out at intervals, with the Durisdeer Hills all new-powdered, grey-white with snow; I hear the rooks among the woods, the voice of rivers rushing near and far,&#x2014;and all is full of impressiveness and meaning to me.</p>
<p>There was a speculation on my Mother&#x2019;s part about coming up hither; but I fear it would be very wearisome to her. There was nothing mentioned of it in a short Note Jamie sen<supplied>[t]</supplied> me since I wrote last. We shall see. I know not whether such an opportunity to have her near me will soon lie in my way again. Ah me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Today I was in Thornhill, and got no other walking, the rain <pb id="pg-14-104" n="14:104"/>coming on. I saw the Russels and others; their little rural existence looks singular, almost touching to me. The people here are very poor; next door to Annandale, not quite Annandale: these Dukes and <hi rend="italic">Drakes</hi> will make a precious business of it by and by!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC may be punning on ducks (Dukes) and drakes (<foreign>draich</foreign>: a lazy slovenly person); i.e., an idle aristocracy foreshadows danger.</note></p>
<p>Poor Jane seems still extremely weak. I await your next Bulletin of her with anxiety. Go and see her as often as you can, comfort her as you can.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John replied, <date when="1842-03-30">30 March</date>: &#x201C;I went down to Chelsea on Sunday &#x26; also yesterday. Jane is still looking pale &#x26; has occasional fits of palpitation, but on the whole I think she is better. &#x2026; I took Miss Welsh yesterday to see Westminster Abbey &#x26;c. Mrs Macready was to spend the day with Jane &#x26; drive.&#x201D;</note> She has had a right sore loss. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my dear Brother: I hope we shall meet again before long. Your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>The cigars seem excellent, tho&#x2019; I have not tried them yet except by the eye. I brought two dozen <hi rend="italic">cubas</hi> with me from Liverpool, not so bad, part of which still remain. No right <hi rend="italic">pipes</hi> here!</p></ps>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>Take a word today too, before I go away. The weather is grim, blustery, but dry; I must go at half-past two or at four. I shall hardly be back till Thursday.</p>
<p>The poor violets I am afraid are hardly out; indeed I am not quite sure that those little blue things are they, but there is nothing else here of a violet colour. These have got so far under the shelter of one of the laurel bushes. Our rude wind blue<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> down the westernmost of the two big hollies at the crossing of the walks; I have mended it as my strength could, till more strength arrive; it will still grow its time. These red flowers are the only perfect ones. Poor flowers!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Today the little chair for Scotsbrig being to go over, I have directed old Mary to accompany and convey at the same time all the flower-pots in the window at the stairhead to Mrs Russell; the old bronzed stucco urns that were once ours and now stand on the sideboard are to go to her at the same time. It seems to me not impossible that the drawing-room fire-screens may be got packed somewhere about the sideboard; we will wait till we see. I have sent the <hi rend="italic">smaller</hi> of the two Pictures to Mrs M&#x2019;Veagh, the one I think called three generations; it was easier for <pb id="pg-14-105" n="14:105"/>old Mary to carry: the resemblance of the child to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> was not visible to me. Cousin Johnny&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh.</note> picture is already either in Liverpool or London; I think they gave it to himself. I know not yet what memorial to get for Jean and for Mary; but I shall find something. I have given a poor Boy of Dr Russell&#x2019;s,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Wull Fingland; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420412-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-04-12">12 April</date></ref>.</note> whom she liked, who staid here three nights when one of her miserable servants failed, a Tardy&#x2019;s Dictionary and an old Livy;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The popular <hi rend="italic">Explanatory Pronouncing Dictionary of the French Language</hi> (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>) &#x201C;according to Abb&#xE9; Tardy.&#x201D; Titus Livius (<date>59 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>&#x2013;<date when="0017-00-00">17 <hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi></date>), one of the popular edns. of his history of Rome.</note> I remembered the <hi rend="italic">Tardy</hi>, but thought a charitable orphan heart best deserved it.</p>
<p>I have had the Letter-cutter here this morning, and given him minute instructions; he is to have the Inscription done on Saturday night come a week, and to bring me Cranston the Innkeeper&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> certificate. I have also had another man. I begin again to hope that in about two weeks more I may have all things done.</p>
<p>In the drawing room, I perceive, are two Tables; one a round or oval (very like the down-stairs one at Chelsea), the other a smallish square one that stands under the hanging book-shelves. Which of these? I sent one of the four-footed stools along with the little chair to my Mother. Have you any use at all for these <hi rend="italic">dining-room</hi> window-curtains? It seems they do not go with the house; they are of blue glazed cotton, and appropriate where they are: if I knew what to <hi rend="italic">buy them in</hi> again at&#x2014;?&#x2014; Or on the whole why trouble you with  I shall have M&#x2019;Caig&#x2019;s List at my return; I will mark out whatever is not to be sold in that,&#x2014;and endeavour to get more perfectly by heart the things here; which hitherto I cannot yet perfectly do.</p>
<p>What becomes of you my poor Wife? Can you read anything within doors in your seclusion? Let not the day pass with you in sad thoughts alone! Friends do not yet know that you will see anybody, or perhaps more than enough of them were about you. Would you not like to see Mrs Jameson? The Sterlings are far off; but indeed in them is not much resource,&#x2014;except their kindness, which even in old Sterling is very genuine.</p>
<p>I have written to T. Spedding and to Lockhart; I think of writing again to Thomas Erskine: in the long evenings, when there is not moonlight for a walk, I write somewhat, or read old wrecks of books: my very sadness and vacancy is profitable to me. Let us look our miseries in the face, the <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> in the face, however miserable. Man was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> made to be wretched; it is his own fault if his Life be not great <pb id="pg-14-106" n="14:106"/>and glorious however full of toils and tears. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my poor dear orphaned one.

<dateline><place>Templand</place>, Thursday <date when="1842-03-31">31 March 1842</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>My dear Wife,&#x2014;</salute>Last night your Letter lay for me, as a little solace when I returned weary; this morning Mary finds nothing. I bethink me that I must send you a line tonight or else there will be a a<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> vacancy till Monday with you. Mill&#x2019;s visit seems to have done you really some good: I am much obliged to him for calling.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill wrote to Barclay Fox, <date when="1842-04-05">5 April</date>: &#x201C;Carlyle is in Scotland owing to the almost sudden death of Mrs Carlyle&#x2019;s mother: Mrs Carlyle &#x2026; seems to have suffered much. &#x2026; It is said &#x26; I believe truly that they will now be in much more comfortable circumstances than before. They heroically refused to receive anything from Mrs Welsh during her lifetime&#x201D; (Mineka 13:513).</note> If you had once sunshine for getting out, I should begin to think more favourably of Jeannie and you.</p>
<p>Menteith staid on Tuesday till the time for the two-o&#x2019;clock conveyance was unattainable. I carried out my Bag to the road (old Mary having gone to seek some sawyer of old sticks or the like), and there after long weary waiting, the last Coach took me up. The afternoon was dry but windy and cold; I felt in such a state of melancholy, and spirits altogether depressed, as I had hardly experienced even here before. At Dumfries I could find nobody I had business with at home: about nine o&#x2019;clock Aird<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Aird.</note> came over to Jean&#x2019;s, and set me talking;&#x2014;this was but a small benefit either, with the prospect of a night at the Commercial Inn. The truth is I am still in a very infirm state of liver; continually on the borders of my old complaint, which is ever ready to return on me, which acts greatly on the spirits too. Between 3 and 4 in the morning, Boots roused me, knocking loud and for long periods to rouse three bagmen: one of my first reflexions was that I must perforce get thro&#x2019; all my affairs early in the afternoon, and walk back to Templand (since there was no other conveyance), not risking another night <pb id="pg-14-107" n="14:107"/>in that establishment. Almost beyond expectation I accordingly did get everything pretty well managed, sent my Bag by the Carrier, and took the road again a little before five. It was and had been showery, not like to be wet; the good Aird insisted on going almost the first six miles with me. At Cluden Tollbar I saw the Mrs Black, an honest respectable-looking woman, full of kind sorrowful remembrances: she is to come up herself on Tuesday next, and bargain about the cow. About nine o&#x2019;clock I arrived here, and got coffee: I seemed no worse for my walk, which was hardly more unpleasant than a stagecoach would have been, in the mood I was in. Today however I am obliged to be very quiet,&#x2014;especially as the weather again is rough. Tomorrow I fancy I shall have to go and speak to &#x201C;the Factor&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably William Maxwell.</note> I bethink me that I shall have to go some time or other. An elderly kind of Lady has been here today, a Mrs Steel from the Cross-Roads, who wants the house; a very talkative, seemingly poor and forlorn widow, whom if I can do anything to help, it will seem to me a charity. I consigned her to Margaret and Mary to shew her the Garden &#x26;c, and got her away,&#x2014;poor woman. She is very like George Irving&#x2019;s Agnes;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving&#x2019;s brother (d. <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>).

Her husband was suddenly lost in the W. Indies.</p>
<p>The Auctioneer&#x2019;s Advertisement, in a very imperfect state, is here; I must get on with that, straightway on pain of losing another week,&#x2014;&#x201C;the Duke&#x201D; may answer as he will. I find there are 12 drawing-room chairs, not of great value as chairs; I have studied occasionally all morning whether we ought in real wisdom to bring them,&#x2014;or to give up the attempt as a natural, pious, but not a reasonable purpose? I incline still to decide for the affirmative, your affection for them I suppose being great. The Dumfries Packer (J<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Aitken tells me) can still be had. I am beginning to be very impatient to have done here. By rapid pushing on my part, we may perhaps have finished on this day fortnight.</p>
<p>My Dearest, it is a poor <foreign><hi rend="italic">wersh</hi></foreign> [feeble] story I send you, out of my solitude today. I send many a thought too, which is not written; which I should find difficulty in writing or in uttering.

<salute>My dear Mrs Stanley,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for writing to me; you are always very kind and good. I fear I shall not get away from this melancholy region for a fortnight yet: the young Etonian<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Edward John (<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1903-00-00">1903</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36246"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), later 3d Baron Stanley of Alderley.</note> will have gone back to his place, and I shall not make his acquaintance this time either. Surely if I could afford a Boy of yours any guidance or help whatever, it would be a true pleasure to me. The little fellow loves you well, it seems; he is affectionate, ingenuous, modest almost to excess: Nature is generally the chief and best guide of such; and I have remarked that they are apt to prosper, and unfold themselves in spite of every hindrance.</p>
<p>My life here is one of the most entirely solitary now going on under the Sun. Heavy-footed Scotch rustics, with their caution and greed, with their loquacity and cunning, consume in their poor businesses some portion of each of my days: but for the other hours I am alone,&#x2014;alone as if I were in <hi rend="italic">Hades</hi>, no company but God&#x2019;s dumb Earth, and the Spirits of the Departed, which also <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> not! Silence alone is noble, godlike; all Speech is comparatively a poor matter. The voice of these old rivers is older than Semiramis or Sesostris;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mythical queen of Assyria, who m. Ninus, reputed founder of Nineveh; after he d., according to legend, she founded many other cities.

Ah me, here again are the old mountains grey with snow-powder; and the black spring tempests, and whirlwinds of shower,&#x2014;and then the sunshine breaking out pale-bright; like immortal Hope, in this Life of ours, thro&#x2019; toils and tears! It is all sad, and much more solemn than a Church; but not to be called miserable, perhaps wholesome, happy.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Pray go down and see my poor Wife: she is still very weak and disconsolate: her Mother, the last Parent, almost the last relative she had, <pb id="pg-14-109" n="14:109"/>was one worth regretting. She is unwell too, I think. The sight of your bonny face looking kindly on her, will do her good.</p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>Matters go on at a snail&#x2019;s pace with me here, nobody but myself caring <hi rend="italic">how</hi> slow they proceed. I have never yet got any final bargain about the House with the Jardines or with anybody. The Mr Moffat you heard of did offer what I considered reasonable terms, and seemed a man of good breeding and discretion, whom I should have liked to treat with; but the pigheaded Jardine would not quit his land except he got&#x2014;&#xa3;100! Such was his modest proposal; whereupon Moffat instantly withdrew altogether. I found moreover that I should have some application to make to &#x201C;the Duke&#x201D; before I could be allowed to bargain at all. This is accordingly done; the <hi rend="italic">answer</hi> daily expected; and so the matter hangs for the present. I find it intolerable to wait, wait and higgle-haggle in this manner: so I decide on getting on with the sale at any rate. The Auctioneer is to <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> here, for the second time today; I fancy we shall get an advertisement in the next <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, and then in the next; and have the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Roup</hi></foreign> perhaps this day fortnight.</p>
<p>According to this computation the ensuing week will be the last quiet one I shall have. It strikes me that if the weather were moderate, and my Mother were brought hither over the Hills, she might spend a few days with me here: perhaps I shall not afterwards have so quiet an opportunity of seeing her again on this occasion. You and Alick can judge whether it will be likely to do her mischief to travel at present: Monday, Tuesday, or any of the days,&#x2014;you might choose a good day. I address myself to you and Alick, and will leave you to examine my Mother and decide for us.&#x2014; I myself shall need to be at Dumfries again; and I am for the present become one of the worst travellers in these parts; I will make as little motion serve me as I can for a while.</p>
<p>On Tuesday last I went down to Dumfries; I calculated on staying <pb id="pg-14-110" n="14:110"/>till the Coach could bring me up again on Thursday morning; but I prospered so ill, sleeping at the Commercial Inn that I decided on getting done with all business early on Wednesday, and <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> home again in the afternoon;&#x2014;which I accordingly did: not a very good job, with the roads so muddy; but I at least got out of the way of Bagmen, Boot-jacks and other the like cattle, and had a quiet sleeping-place. My business (except the seeing of Stewart who was not there) lay all tolerably finished behind me; I had seen Adamson, Corson, the Slater &#x26;c, and settled everything as well as I could.</p>
<p>Jane writes me pretty constantly; I find her still very weak, but going on to improve, I think. There is a Letter from her, this morning; and one from Jack, which latter I enclose<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1842-03-30">30 March</date>.</note></p>
<p>The little Chair was sent off on Wednesday; I hope it arrived safe at Ecclefechan by Jardine. It seems, that was not the right chair after all; there was another here that I was to send! We shall certainly see what rectification may be still possible in that. The little chair that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> sent could have gone nowhither else except to Scotsbrig; that is one good point.</p>
<p>My arm is still rather <foreign>feckless</foreign>, and does not gather strength very fast; but neither does it trouble me much: it is not at all painful except when I stretch it the wrong way too suddenly.</p>
<p>Has anything been settled about Jenny yet? Jean thinks she might do well, get sewing work &#x26;c in a room immediately above hers in Dumfries. The Austins, at any rate, ought to be brought to a bearing, of rent or no-rent; and her staying <hi rend="italic">there</hi> or her going be decided accordingly.</p>
<p>Well, you and Alick will have to decide with my Mother. Send a word of writing at any rate. <closer><salute>My love to one and all.&#x2014; Your affectionate Brother.</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Yesterday one of my poor purposes was frustrated, and tomorrow you will feel the disappointment; which I already today, and yesternight when it was too late, very much regret. It is so little that I can do for you; I might at least write a Letter! Accordingly my full intention <pb id="pg-14-111" n="14:111"/>yesterday was to do it: but I set out in the rough wind, while the weather was dry, for a long walk: I went by Penpont, up Scaur Water, round the foot Tynron Doon; I had all along been remembering a poor little joiner&#x2019;s-cottage, which I saw once when poor Auntie and you and I went up, on ponies, to visit the Macturks:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Penpont, village 2 mi. W of Thornhill; 1 mi. further to Tynron Doon, hill, 947 ft.; maternal aunt Jeannie Welsh; the MacTurk family (<ref target="volume-05/lt-18310811-JWC-TC-01"><sic>5:321</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1831-08-11">11 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>) had lived at Strathmilligan, 6 mi. W of Thornhill nr. Sinnel Water.</note> this ride, this cottage which was the centre of it in my memory, I would again recal by looking at the places,&#x2014;the places which abide, while all else vanishes so soon. It was a day of tempestuous wind, but the Sun occasionally shone, the country was grim-bright, the hills of an almost spiritual clearness, and broad swift storms of hail came dashing down from them on this hand and that. It was a kind of <hi rend="italic">preternatural</hi> walk, full of sadness, full of purity. The Scaur Water, the clearest I ever saw except one, came brawling down; the voice of it, like a lamentation among the winds, answering me, as the voice of a brother wanderer and lamenter,&#x2014;wanderer like me thro&#x2019; a certain portion of Eternity and Infinite Space: poor brook, yet <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was nothing but drops of water, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> thought alone gave it an individuality; it was <hi rend="italic">I</hi> that was the &#x201C;wanderer,&#x201D;&#x2014;far <hi rend="italic">older</hi>, and stranger, and greater than the Scaur, or any river or mountain or Earth-planet or thing!&#x2014; The poor joiner&#x2019;s-cottage I could not recognize; no joiner at least was now there: I went to the farther shoulder of the Doon, near Kennedy&#x2019;s house, and then turned homeward again. It was four when I returned; Dr Russell had been here, and was just gone: Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Macqueen still sat here, meaning to stay dinner. Poor man, I felt him to deserve a kind of welcome. He had already been here twice in vain. It was after Post-hours before he went away to Gilchristland,&#x2014;and I did not till then clearly remember that you had heard nothing from me for <hi rend="italic">two</hi> days. Robert is really an innocent ingenuous kind of man. I made him give me old genealogies of the Baillies and Welshes; in which he seemed to be perfect.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kennedy not further identified; Gilchristland is in Closeburn parish, 1 mi. E of Closeburn Hall. Robert M&#x2019;Queen is said to have been a cousin (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 113).</note> He remembered being at the Castle in Crawford when about three years old, with his Mother: &#x201C;There was a <foreign><hi rend="italic">wean</hi></foreign> [infant] in the cradle; this must have been Mrs Welsh!&#x201D; He remembered your grandmother (a &#x201C;beautiful <hi rend="italic">jolly</hi> woman&#x201D;) passing the night with her little ones at his Father&#x2019;s Farm, on their way to Caplegill.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her maternal grandmother, Jean Baillie Welsh (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1790-00-00">90</date>), who had lived at Caplegill, ca. 5 mi. NW of Moffat, at the &#x201C;head of Moffat Water in Annandale&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 98), where Grace Welsh was brought up.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi!</hi></foreign>&#x2014; We set up the poor blown holly, he and I; stooped it sufficiently with sticks. I gave him the old <pb id="pg-14-112" n="14:112"/>Backgammon-board, which he remembered for almost 50 years. He went away with the late twilight. It was then too late for writing to my poor Jeannie; of whom nevertheless my thoughts were full.</p>
<p>This morning come your Letters; this morning I take time by the forelock, and will not go out at all till I have set down a word for you.</p>
<p>My stay here has now a fixed term set to it: after Thursday come a week, there will be no habitation for me here. I went to the Factor or Chamberlain, as I proposed on Friday: a harmless, intelligent enough, rather <foreign><hi rend="italic">wersh</hi></foreign> [weak]-looking man; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had &#x201C;no power,&#x201D; he told me; the &#x201C;Duke&#x2019;s answer&#x201D; could not be here till the <hi rend="italic">end of next week</hi>,&#x2014;there was little doubt but it would be as I wished: I decided straightway on proceeding with the sale and the other assortments; waiting no longer for Dukes and dependants of Dukes. Their part of the business will gradually be settling itself in the interim;&#x2014;or at worst, I must leave the tagrags of it with Hunter, who is both competent and willing. The babbling inconclusive palaver of the rustic population here, if you have anything to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> with them, is altogether beyond a <hi rend="italic">jest</hi> to me: I positively feel it immoral and disgusting. With the Jardine&#x2019;s I will speak no more at all, till I have a Paper all drawn up, and ask them to sign it, or to say No, and depart forevermore. On the whole, however, I expect no real difficulty there.</p>
<p>This then is the last quiet week I shall have here. I have written to my Mother, who volunteered to come up and stay with me a day or two, that if she dare risk the weather she must do it now. I almost fear such a journey for her; she is by no means strong, a degree below even her average I think. But she will, likely, never see Templand more; neither may I soon have a chance of two-days&#x2019; composure beside her again.&#x2014; I have also written to Jamie Aitken to secure the Packer, and have him here (or ready for coming) on Tuesday week. Out of your Letters and my own remembrances I have compiled a List of <foreign><hi rend="italic">retinenda</hi></foreign> [things to be retained], or things not to be sold; and will enclose it here; requesting to have it back again from you, after a day or at most two days, with your remarks. You will get it on Wednesday; if it can come away on Thursday again, that is best; if not till Friday,&#x2014;still well, I shall have it here this day week. The Sale is fixed for the <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi> following that. The Packer, as I said, will come up two days before (on Tuesday probably): on the evening of Thursday come a week, there will be no longer a habitation here. The notion once was to make it <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>; but I remembered after I was in bed, and, with a very childish feeling, wrote, in my shirt, that it must be Thursday rather. Why this? I know not, but felt only that this must be.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-113" n="14:113"/>I now decide clearly for <hi rend="italic">bringing</hi> the drawingroom chairs; the Auctioneer says they will sell only for about 5/ each, being &#x201C;old-fashioned&#x201D; for the rich, and of worth only to poorish people: certainly we will bring them, their fashion is altogether agreeable to me,&#x2014;and to you. Grandfather&#x2019;s poor old desk must not be sold either; the Auctioneer values this at 25/: I had thoughts, for the last few days, of giving it to my brother Alick; who has no such article of furniture, I think; who alone poor unfortunate, has no memorial left him,&#x2014;a thing he will feel deeply. Jamie has such a desk, a bigger one, which belonged to my Father. This is a strong old article, this little one here; not broken anywhere, except at the ends of the two <hi rend="italic">sliders</hi> (for the folding-<hi rend="italic">lid</hi>) where it will be easily repaired. Such things are difficult of carriage. Decide you, however. On the whole I have had more difficulty than enough contriving some memorial for the three women; I consulted Jean, who could only answer, They would like some <hi rend="italic">permanent</hi> thing best. I thought of giving Jean the Cottar&#x2019;s Saturday Night, Picture; Mary the Bonnet with some small Book, perhaps some tablecloth or bed coverlid; there is a poor print of Grace Darling, which I have been destining for Jenny,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Hanning.

Blankets, you reflect, are of all things the easiest carried: light, needing no package, nay capable of assisting in package. On the other hand, if we <hi rend="italic">have</hi> blankets enough? Such things are far saleablest <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.&#x2014; The tambourine will of course go to Liverpool along with the Table. The Aeolean Harp shall not be forgotten,&#x2014;brought, is it not to be?&#x2014; Now let us be pointed: you have time enough to speak to me yet this once, and I might speak again; but there will be no time for a reply of yours. I think you had best, as far as possible, stand by the <hi rend="italic">List</hi>, the image of what your wishes had already fixed upon. Enough, for this day.</p>
<p>I meant to go to Crawford, after the Stonecutter had done; he will be on his way thither this day: the weather shall be bad, or time press hard, if I do not now go. My poor little Wife!</p>
<p>You have here a Letter of Lockhart&#x2019;s which came today: you can <pb id="pg-14-114" n="14:114"/>preserve the <hi rend="italic">verses</hi>, which I think very good and true.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lockhart had written, <date when="1842-04-01">1 April</date>, sending sympathy and three verses of his poem, &#x201C;It is an old belief / That on some solemn shore / Beyond the sphere of grief / Dear Friends shall meet once more.&#x201D; The poem is pbd. in full by A.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Samaritan endeavour on behalf of Burns&#x2019;s Sister is worthy of all praise.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isobel (or Isabella) Begg (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), youngest sister of Robert Burns, m., <date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>, John Begg; widowed with nine children, <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>; at this time living in Tranent, ca. 10 mi. from Haddington, with her dressmaker das. Agnes (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1883-00-00">83</date>) and Isabella (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>). Chambers had already ed. <hi rend="italic">The Poetical Works of Robert Burns</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>) and <hi rend="italic">The Prose Works of Robert Burns</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>), and he was to make use of much information from her for his <hi rend="italic">Life and Works of Robert Burns</hi>, 4 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>), and to give &#xa3;300 in <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date> from a cheap edn. for the support of the das. They were to move to Ayr, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>; see R. B. Begg, <hi rend="italic">Isobel Burns (Mrs. Begg) A Memoir by her Grandson</hi> (Ayr, <date when="1891-00-00">1891</date>). A printed circular, found with TC&#x2019;s letters to Milnes at Trinity College, Cambridge, is headed, &#x201C;The Sister of Burns / (Extract of a letter from Mr Robert Chambers, of Edinburgh, to T. Carlyle Esq.),&#x201D; and says: &#x201C;A sister of Burns, the last survivor of the father&#x2019;s family, still lives. She is now a widow at an advanced age, and resides at the village of Tranent, in Haddingtonshire, with two unmarried daughters, who endeavour to support her by the exercise of their needles. I lately paid her a visit, and found her a decent-looking old person, with a good deal of the poet&#x2019;s physiognomy, and particularly his fine dark eyes. The youngest of William Burns&#x2019;s children, she was twelve years old at the time he died at Lochlea, a broken-spirited man. She was one of the household at Mossgiel during its occupancy by Robert and Gilbert Burns in succession, and she afterwards married a person named Begg, who, for ten years, conducted the business of Gilbert&#x2019;s farm of Dunning, on the estate of Sir Charles S. Monteath of Closeburn. Since the death of her husband, her sons being all removed from her, and unable to assist her, she has been dependent on her two daughters, who, though active and most respectable young women, are barely able to keep house for themselves and their venerable parent. In short, the Sister of Burns has fallen in the course of Providence into poverty, and her last years are threatened with those distresses, the dread of which is the theme of so many of her brother&#x2019;s verses. I was much affected on hearing her say that, having in her earliest years been witness of the troubles which lowered over her father&#x2019;s house, having afterwards partaken of the hardships at Mossgiel, having passed through a long married life in circumstances at no time easy, and being now reduced to absolute indigence, she felt as if she had walked side by side with Grief from her very childhood. One only alleviation of her fate has sprung from the fame of her brother, in the shape of the most trifling annual pittance from the Scottish Exchequer. She was lately a candidate for the benefit of a fund called the Craig-Crook-Mortification (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Anglice</hi></foreign>, endowment); but her application, for the mean time, failed.&#x201D; Chambers went on to recommend her and the das. as &#x201C;worthy persons&#x201D;: &#x201C;The public is doubtless much taxed; but &#x2026; some claims are sacred. The poems of Burns daily give delight to thousands, and will continue to do so for ages. His productions wax yearly in public esteem, as time passes and brings no second Burns. The name of the Ayrshire bard has been associated by some living writers with those of which England is proudest. While He soars so high, to think of one so near and dear to him as a sister sinking into penury&#x2014;hearing from a cold ingle-cheek the echoes of a nation&#x2019;s acclaim at every mention of the name she bears&#x2014;she, the last of the real members of that group which, as a poetical picture, must live for ever in the &#x2018;Cotter&#x2019;s Saturday Night&#x2019;&#x2014;in short the SISTER OF BURNS&#x2014;to think of all this, I say, is more than I can suppose the public patiently enduring, burdened as it is.&#x201D; The circular explains that a committee had been formed to raise and receive contributions consisting of Chambers as sec. and treas., Charles Menteath (given as &#x201C;Monteath&#x201D;), TC himself, and the Scottish singer John Wilson (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29667"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), of Covent Garden Theatre.</note> It strikes one as a most tragical fact, this that you announce. <pb id="pg-14-115" n="14:115"/>How many tavern dinners are eaten yearly in all quarters of the globe, and froth-speeches delivered, in elegiac commemoration of the brokenhearted Robert Burns, with &#x201C;Ah, the barbarously-entreated Poet; ah, if <hi rend="italic">we</hi> had him here now!&#x201D;&#x2014;and his own Sister <hi rend="italic">is</hi> yet here, and one of those tavern dinner bills would be a benefit to her; and froth-speech is still all that results! &#x201C;Be you warmed, be ye fed,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. James 2:16.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">our</hi> pockets remain buttoned, only our foolish mouths are open, to eat and to jabber. It is damnable. Such &#x201C;worship of Heroes&#x201D; is like much else <pb id="pg-14-116" n="14:116"/>that it holds of,&#x2014;a thing requiring peremptorily <hi rend="italic">to be altered</hi>. I for one thank you that you have stirred to act in this matter, instead of dining and talking!</p>
<p>There can be no possible objection to your use of my name in the way proposed; unless it be that a better were easily procurable: Loc<supplied>[k]</supplied>hart&#x2019;s, for example, whom I doubt not I could soon persuade, were I back again in London.</p>
<p>You must also take my poor guinea; a kind of widow&#x2019;s mite,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mark 12:42; Luke 21:2.</note> which, as all authors are, it will be a luxury for me to give. I think also I can gather a few guineas more in my home circle, if you sent me a half dozen of your subscription papers up to Town.</p>
<p>A mournful event has brought me down hither, and still detains me here: but in some two weeks more I expect to be at Chelsea again.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many good wishes, and even good remembrances (for your face and voice, as well as books, are known to me from of old), I remain,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Wife,&#x2014;</salute>Your little Letters are a solace to me every morning, when I sit down to my hermit breakfast here: Soon after I have done, old Mary is likely to be nearly back, and the chance of something from you is always a possession. Tomorrow I need not hope; and I am regretting today again to think that you this day have been disappointed of me. Nay who knows but you may think I was worse in health than usual! I should have decidedly written you a word that night, and omitted rather any other.&#x2014; For the rest, you need not trouble yourself about my health: it does improve on the whole; I feel now much <hi rend="italic">quieter</hi>, in fact much liker a healthy man, than when I quitted Chelsea. I have brandy, I have all things,&#x2014;silence and free air and thought, especially. Margaret makes me hen-soup from time to time; I begin to get sleep in greater quantity again: in fact I am doing very well; and hope to have this last week of composure here, and then at the end of next week to bid the place my composed and mournful farewell.</p>
<p>Today is still and bright; altogether one of the beautifullest of days: I hope Jeannie and you are getting your <hi rend="italic">excursion;</hi> that it will be the <pb id="pg-14-117" n="14:117"/>beginning of better days for you. It was on the whole very well you did not come hither. All things would have fallen with such a deadly weight of grief on you;&#x2014;vacant, vacant; the transitory still here; so much that was transitory found more lasting than what we wished to endure forever! The mark of her neat orderly hand, full of humble thrifty elegance very touching in itself anywhere and anywhen, is in all corners of this house; and she&#x2014;has gone a long journey! Patience, my Darling; she has gone whither we are swiftly following her. Perhaps essentially <hi rend="italic">she</hi> is still near us; <hi rend="italic">near</hi> and <hi rend="italic">far</hi> do not belong to that Eternal world, which is not of Space nor of Time. God rules that too: we do know nothing more.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; The sight of these poor flowers which I have gathered for you has led me into such thoughts, which perhaps I had better have spared. The poor little flowers have all ventured out this bright day; and there is nobody to bid them right welcome now.</p>
<p>I have been at the Russells&#x2019; this morning; I went with a Letter for Dumfries,&#x2014;old Mary at the moment had gone away on some other small errand. James Monteath came in while I was there: he had been negociating about getting Margaret for a servant; but she had altogether declined: &#x201C;if she went anywhither it would be to Mrs Carlyle or to Mr Welsh.&#x201D; She gives me very little trouble here; and tho&#x2019; I have not investigated her with any strictness, and cannot yet be said to <hi rend="italic">know</hi> her character, I esteem her a superior person, and feel that she was a great blessing here in a time of great need. Poor old Mary cannot think of quitting Templand, while there is any fire of ours burning in it. I keep out of the way of her speech; but the sight of her poor old face does me a kind of good.</p>
<p>Tomorrow Mrs Black comes here about the Cow: I will try if she can get it without hurting other interests. On Wednesday I had to promise a call to Monteath,&#x2014;which he would fain have made a dinner of: a mild-natured, vivacious, very wearisome well-conditioned man; whom one decidedly rather likes. His Father, quite ruined, has gone to Edinburgh, and left him here at &#x201C;the Hall&#x201D; to manage and retrench.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I suppose I ought to go and see the poor old Mundells; I will some day. Bennett called here a while ago; but his fat vivacity was little to my taste  I had already called at his house with your Uncle.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420310-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-03-10">10 March</date></ref>, for both calls.</note> That will do, between us, I fancy.</p>
<p>By the bye I hope Jeannie keeps the Liverpool people instructed of our history here? To make assurance complete, I think of writing soon again myself. John, if I remember, sends me nothing since his Cigars; which message I surely answered? I have written to Chambers, in prompt cooperative disposition toward his poor Mrs Begg: did you <pb id="pg-14-118" n="14:118"/>ever hear of her at Tranent? I suggested Lockhart as a fitter committee-man; but C. has small attraction thitherward, I fancy.&#x2014;&#x2014; Tell me every thing, Dearest; all the outs and ins of thy little history. Love to Cousin Jeannie the good and quiet, and get fast well again. <closer><salute>God bless thee.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Word comes from Chelsea that, among other arrivals, there is that of a Book or Pamphlet &#x201C;from Archdeacon Hare&#x201D;;&#x2014;something of your own writing, as I anticipate, which can be read with pleasure when one returns.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly <hi rend="italic">Privileges Imply Duties: a Charge to the Clergy of the Archdeaconry of Lewes</hi> (<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>).</note> Accept kind thanks beforehand for such a proof of your friendly remembrance,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote &#x201C;rememembrance.&#x201D;</note> which cannot be other than valuable to me.</p>
<p>I am here, far North, on a very mournful business. My Wife&#x2019;s good Mother, once the hospitable mistress of this house, has been unexpectedly summoned away by Death, and left it all vacant, doleful, and as if suddenly fallen into ruin. It used to be so loud with cheerful welcomes and hospitality; and now I have it all to myself; I stay here getting it as swiftly as possible abolished and put an end to&#x2014;&#x03A4;&#x03B5;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;: what a word is that,&#x2014;which we have often to say! My poor Wife, whose last Parent, almost last blood-relative this was, had started from a sickroom on the first news of danger; travelling all night she was met at her uncle&#x2019;s door in Liverpool by the news that all was already over. She stopt there; she is now home again with one of her cousins: you may fancy in what mood.</p>
<p>Sterling, whom one&#x2019;s thought often follows in these nights over the seas, informs me that you too have been visited by Death; that a dear Brother, and one who deserved to be dear, lies hidden from you, suddenly, under sad circumstances, in a foreign grave.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis George Hare (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), d. at Palermo, Sicily, <date when="1842-01-12">12 Jan.</date></note></p>
<p>What can we say? Face to face with such Events, all human Speech sinks dumb; owns that it is naught, inadequate, and like a mockery to the great <hi rend="italic">un</hi>speakable Fact. &#x201C;Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 14:20.</note> Had all miracle (as in these brutish ages it nearly <pb id="pg-14-119" n="14:119"/>has) faded utterly away out of Life, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is forever a miracle, even to the very brutes.

<p>Did I ever tell you that our Scotch version of the Psalms, which you have republished with some polishing, and reckon justly far the best, is properly an English version? It was done, as I find, by old Francis Rouse, a Cornish Scholar, Puritan and Parliamenteer, under the auspices of the Westminster Assembly; &#x201C;appointed to be sung in Churches,&#x201D; which appointment all but the Scotch have long since forgotten. Rouse was of the Long Parliament, was Speaker of the one called Barebone&#x2019;s Parliament, and finally Provost of Eton: in the Prints of him he has dark deep eyes, and a revered, resolute countenance,&#x2014;honour to Sir Francis.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Portions of the Psalms, in English Verse, Selected for Public Worship by J.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I hope you have returned safe out of Perthshire; and found your little Boy recovering or recovered. Our Coaches here go eastward only in the afternoon; so that on Tuesday night I did not find you, and on Wednesday I learned that there was no chance of finding you. The Tuesday night was the unluckiest; for I had as good as nothing else to have occupied me.</p>
<p>My sleep at the Commercial Inn was so infested by early Bagmen and their Boots that I (who am the poorest of sleepers, even apart from Bagmen) decided on getting back to Templand that night, and on not trying to sleep there again except in case of urgency. Once more in Dumfries I believe I must be: but I shall try to make a day&#x2019;s visit serve; and <hi rend="italic">which</hi> day, except that probably it may be among the latest allowable, is not yet fixed.</p>
<p>This current week terminates the quiet part of my existence here; and on the Thursday following, all is to dissipate itself in Sale by Auction: no home, not even an <hi rend="italic">un</hi>quiet one, here for me any more. I should have liked well could we have driven to Craigenputtoch together: but in your present state of occupation, I fear it will not be possible within my time?</p>
<p>Still however I must contrive to see you again, somewhere or other. Most likely I shall be in Annandale for a day of two before returning Southward: we have still a fortnight to work upon, and will not give it up.</p>
<p>M&#x2019;Diarmid&#x2019;s Clerk, attempting to extricate the Craigenputtoch advertisements from your account, declared at last that you had <hi rend="italic">already paid</hi> some of them; that for the moment he could not manage it! Will you be so kind as take order about this, and let <hi rend="italic">me</hi> get the poor man paid. I am to see him again,&#x2014;probably about this day week.</p>
<p>A certain very lazy-paced, stingy-looking, <foreign><hi rend="italic">flegmy</hi></foreign> old man, called Irving, once Farmer of Locherben,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the road from Scotsbrig to Thornhill.</note> was here one day, inquiring about the &#x201C;sale of certain lands&#x201D; (alluding to Craigenputtoch): all my remarks he answered with a deep-throated long-drawn &#x201C;A-a-a-ye!&#x201D;&#x2014;and was slow to depart, tho&#x2019; I told him that you alone could throw light <pb id="pg-14-121" n="14:121"/>on the matter for him. Evidently nothing whatever will come of the old blockhead:&#x2014;A-a-aye!</p>

<p><salute>Dear Mr. Erskine,&#x2014;</salute>I know not whether my poor wife has yet answered the letter you sent to her, but I know that, if not, yet she means with her earliest strength to do so; for she described it as having been a true solace to her, as having &#x201C;told her the very things she was thinking&#x201D;&#x2014;a most na&#xEF;ve and complete definition of a letter that <hi rend="italic">deserved</hi> to be written. Thanks to you in her name and my own. The poor heart seems gathering composure gradually, though still very weak; and in weak bodily health too, imprisoned by the rough spring weather. A young cousin is with her at Chelsea: a cheery, sensible, affectionate girl, whom she describes as a great support to her. Mrs. Rich<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Rich.</note> and all her friends, summoned by a great calamity, had shown themselves full of sympathy and help. It is what mortals owe to one another in such a season. The little birds shrink lovingly together when a great gyrfalcon has smitten one of them. Death I account always as a great deliverance, a dark door into Peace, into everlasting Hope. But it is also well named from of old the King of Terrors&#x2014;a huge demon-falcon rising miraculously we know not whence, to snatch us away from one another&#x2019;s sight we know not whither! Had not a God made this world, and made Death too, it were an insupportable place. &#x201C;Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.&#x201D; Even so. In whom else, or in what else?</p>
<p>My days pass along here, where a multiplicity of small things still detains but does not occupy me, in a most silent, almost sabbath-like manner. I avoid all company whatever&#x2014;except the few poor greedy-minded very stupid rustics who have some affairs with me, which I struggle always to despatch and cut short. I see nobody; I do not even read much. The old hills and rivers, the old earth with her star firmaments and burial-vaults, carry on a mysterious unfathomable dialogue with me. It is eight years since I have seen a spring, and in such a mood I never saw one. It seems all new and original to me&#x2014;beautiful, almost solemn. Whose great laboratory is that? The hills stand snow-powdered, <pb id="pg-14-122" n="14:122"/>pale, bright. The black hailstorm awakens in them, rushes down like a black swift ocean tide, valley answering valley; and again the sun blinks out, and the poor sower is casting his grain into the furrow, hopeful he that the Zodiacs and far Heavenly Horologes have not faltered; that there will be yet another summer added for us and another harvest. Our whole heart asks with Napoleon: &#x2018;<foreign>Messieurs</foreign>, who made all that? <hi rend="italic">Be silent</hi>, foolish <foreign>Messieurs</foreign>!&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;The Hero as King&#x201D;: &#x201C;His <foreign><hi rend="italic">savans</hi></foreign>, &#x2026; in that voyage to Egypt, were one evening busily occupied arguing that there could be no God. They had proved it, to their satisfaction, all by manner of logic. Napoleon looking up into the stars, answers, &#x2018;Very ingenious, <foreign>Messieurs</foreign>: but <hi rend="italic">who made</hi> all that?&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 5:239).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Lockhart,</salute>
<p>Your Letter is very kind and friendly; thanks to you for it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lockhart wrote, <date when="1842-04-01">1 April</date>: &#x201C;Pray, since you have spoken of this loss, speak again and tell me that it brings some addition to your worldly resources, i.e., <hi rend="italic">&#xa3;,s.d.</hi>&#x2014; Makes you a fatter victim for the altar of Income-Tax Peel. &#x2026; <supplied>[I]</supplied>t would be a fine thing to be independent of booksellers, and, though I don&#x2019;t hope ever to be so, I would fain hear that you are henceforth.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>We are not much richer even in money by our good Mother&#x2019;s death, which has made us poorer in so many other ways: a small <foreign><hi rend="italic">peculium</hi></foreign> once hers is now ours, and might in case of extremity keep the hawks out of a poor Author&#x2019;s eyes (which is a blessing too): but henceforth as heretofore our only sure revenue must be the great one which Tullius speaks of by the name <foreign><hi rend="italic">Parcimonia</hi></foreign>,&#x2014;meaning abstinence, rigorous abnegation, Scotch thrift, in a word!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marcus Tullius Cicero, <hi rend="italic">De Officiis</hi> 2:87.</note> Not so bad a <foreign><hi rend="italic">vectigal</hi></foreign> [income], after all. Really the Scotch are a meritorious people. They make wholesome pottage by boiling oatmeal in water; savoury soup of a singed sheep&#x2019;s head. They teach a poor man to understand that he is verily to live on bread and water, or even to die for want of bread and water, rather than beg, and be another&#x2019;s bondsman. They say, with their rigorous stoicism, and Calvinism which is Hyper-Stoicism: &#x03B1;&#x03C0;&#x1F73;&#x03C7;&#x00F5;&#x03C5;, &#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x1F11;&#x03C7;&#x00F5;&#x03C5;; suffer, abstain; thou art there to abstain and endure! Honour to them, poor fellows. It is really the lesson which Destiny itself teaches every man, in the great inarticulate way, throughout this Life; and if the man be not a blockhead and unteachable, <pb id="pg-14-123" n="14:123"/>he learns it, let him be born in a peasant&#x2019;s hut or a king&#x2019;s palace.</p>
<p>We growl much about Bookseller-servitude; worse than Algerine;&#x2014;and yet at bottom we are but a foolish folk. Consider you, for example, how many of your good things you would perhaps never have taken the trouble to write at all had there been no such servitude! <hi rend="italic">Servitude</hi> was a blessing and a great <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi>, the greatest that could be given a man! So the shrewd little De Staal, on reconsidering and computing it, found that the place where of all places ever known to her she had enjoyed the most freedom was the Bastille.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires</hi> (<date when="1755-00-00">1755</date>), Marguerite Cordier de Launay, Baroness de Staal (<date when="1684-00-00">1684</date>&#x2013;<date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>), told of her imprisonment in the Bastille.</note>&#x2014; As to me, I have dragged this ugly millstone Poverty at my heels, spurning it and cursing it often enough, ever since I was a man; yet there it lagged and lumbered on: and at length I was obliged to ask myself, Had they <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> it for thee, sent thee soaring like a foolish tumbler-pigeon, like a mad Byron! Thank the millstone, thou fool; it is thy ballast, and keeps the center of gravity right! In short we are a foolish people, born fools&#x2014;and it were wise perhaps, at present, to go and smoke a pipe in silence under the stars.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>The mountain-tops are a-glow like so many volcanoes: it is poor tarry shepherds<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Because they used tar to &#x201C;smear&#x201D; sheep as a protection against the weather.</note> burning their heather, to let the grass have a chance. Sirius is glancing blue-bright like a spirit,&#x2014;a comrade of mine these twenty years. Penpont smoke-cloud and Drumlanrig Castle<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seat of the Duke of Buccleuch; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390727-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:155</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-07-27">27 July 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> have alike gone out. In the North is an Aurora,&#x2014;footlights of this great Theatre of a Universe, where you and I are players for an hour. God <hi rend="italic">is</hi> great; and all else is verily altogether small.</p>
<p>These last days, the rustics and factors driven out of my way, have been altogether like a kind of Sabbath to me,&#x2014;different enough from Agnew&#x2019;s.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Andrew Agnew (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/215"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) of Lochnaw, Wigtonshire, leader of the Sunday observance movement.</note> Unhappily they are now to end: in the beginning of next week come packers, carpenters; on the thursday it all ends in an uproar of Auctioneers &#x26;c: I before that am far off, never to return hither.

<dateline><place>Templand</place>, Tuesday Afternoon <date when="1842-04-05">5 April, 1842</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>My dear Wife,&#x2014;</salute> This is again a beautiful sunshiny windless day, in which I hope you participate. You get a Letter today too, and were at least without a disappointment when the Postman passed.</p>
<p>Mrs Black was here a little after 11 o&#x2019;clock, and staid some two hours. She seems to me a very rational, honest and affectionate woman: she could not speak for some time after I brought her into this diningroom,&#x2014;all vacant for her now. She gave me a long narrative of her last visit here, four weeks and two days before the <hi rend="italic">end</hi>. It was the day after Peggy M&#x2019;Queen had happened to arrive, after the first palsy-shock which they called &#x201C;a faint.&#x201D; She de<supplied>[s]</supplied>cribed<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> how happy our poor Mother was that day; how she joked about her blockhead of a servant, and cooked dinner herself; said the &#x201C;ill turn&#x201D; had done her health much good; brought out all your pictures, my books &#x26;c, and was blithe and cheery as if it were now all over. It was but a few days after, when she was taken ill again, and this Margaret was sent for. Poor Mrs Black is coming up again on the day of Sale, to buy the Cow herself, &#x201C;if she should even give 10/ too dear&#x201D;: poor body, she shall have the Cow, or something that will suit her better. I do imagine she was one of the small joys that cheered those sad days for Her that now needs no comforting.&#x2014; Since that, Margaret, set a-talking by some questions of mine, has had me at the edge of crying, or altogether crying. On the last fatal Friday morning, the poor Sick One said to her, &#x201C;Margaret, I have had a bonny dream; I dreamed that my son was writing a Book with his heart&#x2019;s blood,&#x201D;&#x2014;meaning, I suppose, that it was to be a right excellent Book! Good God! I shall never forget that; it will stick in my memory forevermore.&#x2014; But why do we mourn? As far as I can gather, she died without pain: she had written three letters on the thursday, and walked (by computation of the time) &#x201C;as far as would take her to Closeburn Kirk and back again&#x201D;: Margaret says she had never slept so well before; and bragged of her health, and was in a cheerful <hi rend="italic">joking</hi> humour, not many minutes before. The great God is merciful: the stroke could not have been delivered more softly. But that &#x201C;bonny Dream&#x201D;&#x2014; O Jeannie, that and the poor vision of American <pb id="pg-14-125" n="14:125"/>Placards and Prussian Levees,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently Grace Welsh had a dream about TC&#x2019;s writing and his foreign acclaim, suggested by his intro. to the King of Prussia, <date when="1842-01-29">29 Jan.</date> (see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420205-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1842-02-05">5 Feb.</date></ref>).</note> is a thing inexpressibly sorrowful and sweet to me.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I have set you crying again, I doubt; I did not mean that.</p>
<p>This morning too I had sent for the Widow Steele<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420331-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-03-31">31 March</date></ref>.</note> and she came; radiant with thankfulness, understanding that I meant to help <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to get the house before it went out of my hand. She had no friend whom she could ask to advance &#xa3;100 or &#xa3;120 for her,&#x2014;otherwise so many wishes would have been gratified! But she hoped to get a lease under the Jardines; I sent her off to Morton Mill, to consult with Hunter as to what <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be done and stipulated for her; and I will gladly do that. According to my own proposal to the Duke, I treat <hi rend="italic">charitably</hi>, liberally with the new tenant; and it were well to <hi rend="italic">divide</hi> our bounty with this poor widow, who perhaps is more an object of charity than the thick-skinned labouring Jardines. I will strive to do the wisest possible.</p>
<p>Last night I wrote to your Uncle; also to Julius Hare. Today to Thomas Erskine &#x26;c. I have walked no farther than round by Dalgarnock Churchyard<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 1&#xBD; mi. S of Thornhill.</note> yet; but I calculate on a long stretch in the gloaming. I am decidedly getting better in health; pity that my remaining Sabbath days here are so few: they have all been a kind of sabbath, most sad, but solemn, not without a sort of blessedness.</p>
<p>I wrote to my Mother that if she would come <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was the week;&#x2014;or rather I wrote to Jamie and Alick to consider whether such a journey might be advisable in this weather. She does not come, and as yet no word comes.</p>
<p>There is a poor little docked arm-chair standing in the Porch here,&#x2014;a bit of string tied round the back of it, fastening-on a splinter: that chair shall not be sold; I think of giving it to Jenny. Poor Jenny <hi rend="italic">has</hi> but two chairs, one of them a rocking one! She too is one of my troubles at present; unable to form any resolution, and laid under the necessity of forming one. We will try to get that settled also.</p>
<p>Well; tell me then that you have been out in the Sunshine, Cousin Jeannie and you, and that you are good girls! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Wife.&#x2014; Ever affectionately</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

A penny stamp and a crumb of paper incite all men to be punctual in sending whatsoever bears the semblance of message or needful announcement! It is possible my Mother might arrive tonight or any evening: <hi rend="italic">she</hi>, poor woman, will be most ready, but the delay depends on some other.</p>
<p>My days of quiet here, my last days, are rapidly ebbing away. No stiller existence is led under the Sun at present. The Day beautiful; all things of a beauty, a peace and a sadness to touch one&#x2019;s heart. Till your final return of the List (day after tomorrow) I do almost nothing, in the way of assortment here: on Saturday, and then finally on Monday, I must be entirely alive and decide on innumerable items, with the Auctioneer taking his inventory beside me, and the Packer in the rear of him. They will be three horrid days. I purpose to get Jamie of Scotsbrig or Jamie Aitken, probably both, to take my place here on the Thursday;&#x2014;that day I will take myself away somewhither; that night there will no longer be a lodging for me here: all will have ended here.</p>
<p>Today I had a visit again from the Widow Steele; whom I swiftly got rid of: it was more compliments, reports of &#x201C;Morton Mill&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c. I think I shall go and see Hunter again tomorrow or next day; I want (in anticipation that the Duke&#x2019;s answer <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come) to have <hi rend="italic">all</hi> in a state for terminating itself before the Thursday arrive. It is I that am driving everything forward. I might have waited longer; but not without something definite to do; and that was not worth contriving for all the time I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have staid.</p>
<p>Not long afternoon I set forth to make my call on Menteath: not at home, once more,&#x2014;to my hearty satisfaction. I strolled slowly, deviously, thro&#x2019; the Park towards the Old Castle, among the rooks and field birds, in the beautiful still sunshine; I even lay down upon a <pb id="pg-14-127" n="14:127"/>bank, and looked my fill at it&#x2014; Queen Victory&#x2019;s crown-jewels and drawing-rooms are but a twopenny bauble in comparison. My beautiful divine old mother <hi rend="small-caps">earth</hi>&#x2014;&#x201C;Godlike, or God,&#x201D; as Richter says!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Jean Paul Friedrich Richter,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 26:24.</note>&#x2014; Slowly strolling, for the sun was absolutely too hot for me, I called on the old Mundells. A fire in the <hi rend="italic">drawingroom;</hi> rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Mr This and also rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Mr That coming to dine, I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> absolutely <hi rend="italic">must</hi> stay &#x26;c &#x26;c. Mrs Mundell was distinctly <hi rend="italic">ill-bred</hi> in pressing of me; we made a really awkward bungle of it by way of <foreign>finale</foreign>, for in the lobby or in the very doorway I <hi rend="italic">met</hi> the rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Mr This and Mr That and had to disregard all hints and signals and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> turn back and be introduced to them!&#x2014; The poor old Dr. is very deaf; one can make next to nothing of him. He gave me his Anti-Nonintrusionisms<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mundell supported the presentation of a minister to a parish against the wishes of the congregation, a matter for bitter controversy; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400211-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:43</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-11">11 Feb. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> (very violent little platitudes, rhymed and prose, printed on some 5 small slips of paper), and I came my ways.</p>
<p>All this day, and all days this week, I think of the workmen in Crawford Churchyard. Perhaps it will be on the Thursday that I go thither. Patience, Courage, my poor Darling!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Walter sent me the inclosed Note yesternight. Along with it lay that yeast-bottle of evangelism, Dandyism, hungry vanity and vacuity from Satan Montgomery. Yet my Note was only civil, and studiously written <hi rend="italic">before</hi> reading his Book.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420127-JWC-JOST-01">JWC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, [<date when="1842-01-27">27 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note> Poor fellow, I must and can make no answer farther at present.&#x2014;&#x2014; Margaret has entered a few minutes ago with tea. <closer><salute>Blessings with thee my poor Little Wife!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My Dearest,&#x2014;</salute> Alas, I can see you are ill again by today&#x2019;s Letter; sleepless, and your feelings all set on edge. I wish you had not troubled yourself with the List till next day (which would have corresponded to tomorrow), for there was still time then. Your feeling about Alick is very natural; and shall by me be conformed to. There were sad confusions that arose out of that originally confused business,&#x2014;stern Necessity, and the weakness and dimness that cleaves to human nature, <pb id="pg-14-128" n="14:128"/>pressing upon us all.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC presumably refers to Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s drunken arrival at Templand to collect JWC in <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310818-JWC-TC-01"><sic>5:344&#x2013;45</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1831-08-18">18 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310831-TC-JWC-01"><sic>382</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-31">31 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>. Apparently JWC did not want him to have anything of Grace Welsh&#x2019;s as a memorial. TC had suggested giving him her grandfather&#x2019;s desk; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420403-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-04-03">3 April</date></ref>.</note> Alick this very day was remarking how generous and noble a heart was <hi rend="italic">hers</hi>, which her sensitive delicacies, and her inexperience of any way of life but her own, so often frustrated in the operation. Alas, he too had faults and has,&#x2014;and yet intrinsically a Human Soul not without virtues and the aim towards good is working there also, in that imprisonment, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yet made free by Death! He shall have nothing that was hers; I can make the poor man a gift in some other way. The <hi rend="italic">Cottars Saturday Night</hi> shall come to London; that and the poor old Desk also. I have instructed him to buy back again at the Sale a chair or two for Jenny. If I find nothing suitable for Jean (but I still think I shall), it can be as you say transacted from Chelsea.&#x2014; My Dearest, do not fret your poor heart with remorse in that way! True, none of us can say that we have done what we should or could, now when it is never to be amended more, and dark impassable barriers shut it all in: but your affection <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a thing she never doubted of, or had cause to doubt of; you may well think she does look down with pity on <hi rend="italic">our</hi> imperfections,&#x2014;alas what is it all but imperfection?&#x2014;but it is not <hi rend="italic">true</hi> that you have cause to accuse yourself. Do not accuse yourself, for it is not just. Nay, were it just, what nobler amendment than, for her sake, to determine on better conduct towards those that still live? Turn to the future and the present; my Darling the past is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> criminal in you, and the past is forever away from us all.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I can find no footwarmer here, nor has Margaret ever heard of one; she used to take a common stone jar, in those latter days, and made use of that. Neither is there yet anything of the nature of a knife-sharpener that Margaret knows. We shall be on the outlook for that and for all things when the packing days arrive,&#x2014;with the beginning of next week.</p>
<p>My Mother <hi rend="italic">is</hi> now here, as perhaps you already conjecture. Alick arrived with her, thro&#x2019; Dumfries, last night about nine o&#x2019;clock. Jamie is too busy with his sowing to come or even to spare a horse; they had to hire a horse up. I have consulted along with Alick about all manner of <foreign>Roup</foreign> [sale] arrangements: he, in defect of Jamie, with probably Jamie Aitken will come and assist in the packing and multiplex &#x26;c&#x2019;s: I never, or hardly ever before in my life, saw so many things crowding on me for decision, I totally ignorant of the nature of them, as now lie <pb id="pg-14-129" n="14:129"/>in store for these few days. One way or other the days will be got done: when once one is thoroughly <hi rend="italic">awake</hi>, all manner of things go on better than expectation.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; The Dumfries Packer <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> come, it seems, after all: he &#x201C;has a ship to discharge&#x201D;; he is grown weak and useless at any rate, they say. I am going this Night to ask a question or two of M&#x2019;Caig, and then to write to Jamie Aitken (if I can) in conformity thereto. For there is another Packer, whom J<hi rend="italic">ie</hi> recommends: perhaps M&#x2019;Caig himself will be able to do about as well: at any rate, he can help me to guess, what <hi rend="italic">time</hi>, mats, cord &#x26;c &#x26;c. I then go on to Morton Mill: there wants a man called &#x201C;judge of the Sale&#x201D;; he is to be the man. Why do I trouble my poor Jeannie with all that?</p>
<p>My Mother and Alick, coming in while I sat deep engaged in reading, at such an hour, flurried me all to pieces; I was unwell at any rate, and had decided on a supper of punch: I awoke this morning at five. Alick went away this same afternoon at one o&#x2019;clock,&#x2014;three hours ago; for we have dined now (Mother and I) since I began writing to you. She is full of mournful solemn reflexions, poor old woman, about &#x201C;the last time she was here&#x201D;: she will be very quiet beside me, if once I had her broken in: on Monday she will go down to Dumfries again.&#x2014; All this, however, must excuse the confusion of such a Letter as this.</p>
<p>Good old Mr Dobbie called, just about the time Alick was going away. He had seen my Mother, or she him, I think, about Annan. We were all as usual much pleased with his courteous rusticity and wise simplicity; a thoroughly honest-looking character. His Daugh<supplied>[t]</supplied>er<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> (which was right) has not begun old Mary&#x2019;s pension, till I go away, and she have no more abode here.</p>
<p>The meat-roaster <hi rend="italic">has</hi> been a capital article; but Margaret describes it as much gone: I see nothing wrong but some of the tinning gone: I will bring it at any rate. The old chairs again give me pause,&#x2014;the freightage, then carriage, the package &#x26;c: I myself love the old chairs: I will do my best.</p>
<p>There seemed a look of rain today; but it has now brightened out again. Strange that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have nothing still but nipping bitterness. I shall never expect any good till I hear you have got out.&#x2014; Yes, my dear Wifie, get your warm pan again; and <hi rend="italic">get</hi> a sleep next night! It is a frightful aggravation of all one&#x2019;s miseries of mind or heart to be so wretchedly sick of body.</p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I came up to this place the day before yesterday, to see my son Tom for a little while, who is here by himself at present, on a very melancholy errand, settling up the affairs of his poor Mother-in-law, who was suddenly taken from them some weeks ago; and whose house here none of us are to revisit now any more.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-131" n="14:131"/>Tom consents to be my penman; and address a line of inquiry to you; which I have often and many a time wished to do, or to see done, during the last winter. I might have done it myself, poor writer as I am; but tho&#x2019; I often purposed and attempted, it would never take effect. Tom says it&#x2019;s a shame that Sisters do not send one another news, were they never so ill written, now that any Letter containing a word or half a word will be carried swiftly and safely for one penny!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I heard that you had been very poorly, and were in a manner lamed with rheumatism. Dear Sister, I do intreat you to send me a word of authentic tidings about this. About this, and about all that concerns you and your good Husband<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hugh Mackinnon; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380913-TC-MAC-01"><sic>10:174</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1838-09-13">13 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> and family, every member of which is dear to me. Old age does not dry up my feelings. Our Father&#x2019;s house, and all that are yet alive of it, and all that are dead and have left us here behind them, are still inexpressibly dear to me. The Event that has taken place here recals our own lost Mother to me, and the last time she came out to take leave of me on the road at Cargen-Brig! We did not think it was to be the last; but I saw her no more in this world. God&#x2019;s decrees are inscrutable, past finding out; but we know too that His mercies are great: we have to make His will our will; in Life and in Death it is in His hands that we are.</p>
<p>Our Brother John<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aitken, who lived in Dumfries.</note> has been rather unwell all winter; and, tho&#x2019; he affects to treat it lightly, I understand the disorder still rather hangs about him. The chief symptom was a swelling about the feet and legs. I hope the sunny weather which has now come will set him up again.</p>
<p>Jamie and Isabella at Scotsbrig have had a sore distress not long since: their poor little youngest Boy, was, after very great suffering, taken from them.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had d. <date when="1841-12-27">27 Dec. 1841</date>. In an undated entry of early <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>, TC wrote in his Journal: &#x201C;My poor Brother Jamie&#x2019;s little boy Tom is dead. They are all in distress, no doubt. Life is full of such distresses.&#x201D;</note> He was a wise <foreign>gleg</foreign> [eager] little <foreign>callant</foreign> [<foreign>lad</foreign>]; had much sickness in his short life. Isabella is, and has for years been, in very weak health; tho&#x2019; still going about, and following her affairs. As for myself, the winter never agrees with me: I have had several ill turns; but, except a long fit of sore eyes which still hangs by me, nothing that lasted: and now we are near the summer again, and I feel myself altogether moderately well, and with many causes to be thankful. The Boys and <foreign>Lasses</foreign>, scattered up and down, are all tolerably well in health; all fighting for themselves here or there, with varieties of luck, but all in some true and reasonable kind of way,&#x2014;for which also I am bound to be very thankful.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-132" n="14:132"/>Now, dear Tibbie, send me a word soon, I entreat you and bid you! Tom joins in kind wishes to every one of you. I remain always</p>

<dateline><place>Templand</place>, Saturday, <date when="1842-04-09">9 April, 1842</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>My Dear Wife,&#x2014;</salute>Yesterday morning there came no Letter, and I was in considerable alarm; but after 12 o&#x2019;clock there was a Letter found at Thornhill, and I read it going down the street: I suppose, it had been a minute too late at Chelsea, and so had come by the post of next morning. I was very glad indeed to get it: the tone is very sorrowful still, but not aggravated this time by the incidental misery of shattered sleepless nerves. Today old Mary duly brings a good gentle-hearted little Letter. Yesterday was a blank with you (your Sunday): to avoid all risk of interruption, for various persons may be here on various affairs, I answer you the first thing after breakfast. I am up stairs, in the dim <hi rend="italic">frosty</hi> sunshine, which is warm enough: poor old drawing-room; the last letter or among the last that will ever be addressed to you from it.</p>
<p>There is no Stool correspondent to your bedroom one about this house now: some three <hi rend="italic">little</hi> stools, the whole of which I mean to bring, are all that remain here of that kind. Nobody can give me any account of the other.</p>
<p>It is no wonder you do not understand the business of the House: nobody that did not take into account the mean greediness and endless asinine babble of the common rustics here would be able to conceive it even when explained in full. The clear <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> of Templand Farm, house and all, as at present held by us, is considered to be fully &#xa3;15 a-year (for fourteen years to come yet of the lease) <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> the actual rent paid for it. The Jardines profess themselves willing to take it on these terms; only I should require to be still nominal tenant, to be good for their rent being <hi rend="italic">paid</hi>, and to carry on for the whole 14 years a miserable correspondence about this place,&#x2014;which, as I have said to the Duke, we want only never to hear the name of any more. By advertising, and waiting, there seems to me little doubt but some person would be found to give me &#xa3;150 for the lease, and constitute <pb id="pg-14-133" n="14:133"/><hi rend="italic">himself</hi> tenant (with the Jardines <hi rend="italic">under</hi> him, if they did not like to take themselves away), and so make <hi rend="italic">us</hi> clear of it altogether. Meanwhile, waiting (perhaps another year) does not suit me well; and advertising, it seems, being under the shadow of &#x201C;the Duke&#x201D; always, and entirely controllable and forbiddable by &#x201C;the Duke,&#x201D; might be taken ill; the old Jardine too is a good kind of man, and I fancied his Son&#x2019;s purpose a pious one:&#x2014;in short I had made up my mind, as Hunter too counselled and still counsels, to say to the Jardines: Pay me &#xa3;100 now, and take the thing wholly to yourselves. Of this bargain they are altogether greedy, profess to be &#x201C;thankful&#x201D; for it &#x26;c; and yet the disgusting pig of a Son (who, however, shall not disgust me from my own purpose) objects and grumbles and suspects at every step of the details that still remain,&#x2014;for example, he &#x201C;does not know&#x201D; whether he can take the <hi rend="italic">grates</hi> as they now stand; &#x201C;some of them he will take&#x201D;; the others he had much rather have me tear out, and carry to the house-end, that he might bury them <hi rend="italic">there</hi> a little more handily! The miserable grub. This, with the <foreign>etceteras</foreign> and subsequences, considerably disgusts me at the man. So that for the last fortnight I have not spoken a word to him on the subject, and my purpose is not to speak much more: I will, with Hunter&#x2019;s aid, have a paper all drawn out with every detail marked in it; and I will order him either to sign that, or else take himself away out of my presence forever.&#x2014; So stands it. Pardon all these very base details, unworthy to fill so much of a sheet for you. But having begun to explain, I could not but try to finish. The &#x201C;Duke&#x2019;s permission&#x201D; has never yet come: I fancy it will still draggle itself into more length of negociation than I wish; but I shall have it at least in a state to be left with Hunter. More than once I have been tempted to fling the whole thing at the feet of their most small god-almighty of a Duke, and say, Take it, and at least no <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> more about it!&#x2014;but this of course I discern to be folly, <hi rend="italic">ignorance</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> here (namely the paltriness &#x26;c &#x26;c of many life-elements here), to which a man who will wisely <hi rend="italic">work</hi> here must adapt his manipulation. What has softened me, at all turns, towards their Duke, is the reminiscence how gently <hi rend="italic">she</hi> thought herself treated by him: a thought that disarms my impatience, and converts all rebellious anger into gratitude. This house and place has served <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, and she is gone from it with the honourable regret of all: what I have to do is to deliver it away, so far as I can, in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> spirit, as she would have wished. There is a <hi rend="italic">rap</hi> at the door;&#x2014;ah me, some Packer, Auctioneer or other the like! <foreign>Adieu</foreign> till &#x201C;Hunter&#x201D; be gone, for it is he!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">1&#xBD; o&#x2019;clock</hi>.&#x2014; Hunter has detained me three mortal hours, and set me all into a flurry with talk, talk. He is a shrewd, goodnatured man, I <pb id="pg-14-134" n="14:134"/>think with a dash of cunning in him. He has got all his details put to paper in my company; and is gone, with a dubious kind of expectation that, even &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">without</hi> his Grace&#x2019;s permission&#x201D; which has not arrived by this post either, he will get the affair so adjusted as that Thursday may see the end of it.&#x2014; Enough of all this; much more than enough!</p>
<p>Dr Russell came over last night, while my Mother and I had wandered down to Dalgarnock to see the grave of W. Grahame&#x2019;s Sister.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Howatson (d. <date when="1841-08-30">30 Aug. 1841</date>).</note> The Doctor staid till near ten; a rather burdensome talker, but one whom I could not grudge to see here. I got from him a certain Letter; which you will value more than Bank-Paper, and keep while you live! I know not whether to send it here, for it will call forth a new most poignant emotion: yet I feel as if I had better send it. The good Mother! She had said in words, the Doctor tells me, that she could not in any case wish <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to be by at the last hour (come when it might); it would tear you so asunder. Her will was done. The last morning, Margaret says, she was beautiful, her colour bright and good (alas too good),&#x2014;very death did not for a day make her pale. My Jeannie, thou must nerve thy heart; meet these last stern things with a valiant mind. She was indeed heroic as you say; there was an instinct of real heroism deep in that heart, and visible indeed, at all great moments palpable, in the whole current of her life. Honour now follows her and Love whither she is gone.</p>
<p>No wonder, my dear Wife, you feel disheartened and sick about all work, and weary of the world generally. &#x201C;Benevolence,&#x201D; I also agree with you, is no trade,&#x2014;altogether or nearly altogether a futility when followed as a <hi rend="italic">trade</hi>. Yet work does still remain to be done; and the Highest Law does order us all to work. My prayer is and has always been that you would rouse up the fine faculties that <hi rend="italic">are</hi> yours into some course of real true work, which you felt to be worthy of them and you! Your life would not then be happy; but it would cease to be miserable, it would become noble and clear, with a kind of sacredness shining thro&#x2019; it. I know well, none better, how difficult it all is,&#x2014;how peculiar and original your lot looks to you, and in many ways <hi rend="italic">is</hi>. Nobody can find work <hi rend="italic">easily</hi>, if much work do lie in him. All of us are in horrible difficulties, that look invincible,&#x2014;but that are not so. The deepest difficulty, which also presses on us <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, is the sick Sentimentalism we suck in with our whole nourishment, and get engrained into the very blood of us, in these miserable ages! I actually do think it the deepest. It is this that makes me so impatient of George Sand, Mazzini and all that set of Prophets,&#x2014;impatient, so as often to be unjust to what of truth and genuine propriety of aim is in them. Alas, how often have <pb id="pg-14-135" n="14:135"/>I provokingly argued with you about all that! I actually will endeavour not to do so any more. It is not by <hi rend="italic">arguing</hi> that I can ever hope to do you any service on that side. But I will never give up the hope to see you adequately <hi rend="italic">busy</hi> with your whole mind; discovering as <hi rend="italic">all</hi> human beings may do, that in the grimmest rocky wildernesses of existence there are blessed well-springs, there is an everlasting guiding-star. Courage, my poor little Jeannie&#x2014; Ah me, had <hi rend="italic">I</hi> been other, for you too it might have been all easier:&#x2014;but I was not other, I was even <hi rend="italic">this</hi>. In such solemn seasons, let us both cry for help to be better for each other, and for all duties, in time coming! Articulate <hi rend="italic">prayer</hi> is for me not possible; but the equivalent of it remains forever in the heart and life of man: I say, let us pray, God look down upon us; guide us not happily but <hi rend="italic">well</hi> thro&#x2019; life, unite us well with our Buried Ones according to His will!&#x2014; Amen.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; No more at present.</p>
<p>Thomas Erskine&#x2019;s Letter came this morning: a transient notion was that I might return by Dundee; apparently that is over now.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine was going to London; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420423-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-04-23">23 April</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I have written a long scribble, not worth writing or sending,&#x2014;if not as proof of what my aims were. My &#x201C;days of quietude&#x201D; are already ended here: I must now prepare myself for an enormous bustle. That too will pass. You may address hither with certainty till Tuesday afternoon; that will correspond to Friday here: after Friday I know not very precisely yet where I shall be; but you shall have directions how to write.&#x2014; Tomorrow, which is Sunday too, I expect to be in a quieter way, with more of good <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> in my nerves.</p>
<p>My Mother, with a kind speechless heart, does speak so far as to ask if I will send you her blessing. She was telling me yesterday all about the last parting with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> Mother, how she came out to the middle of the road to take leave of them &#x26;c: old scene-images, sunk forty years in the Past, which still can bring tears into old dim eyes!&#x2014;Ah me, ah me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Well, I will not add another word today; for I have still much to do, and have <hi rend="italic">written</hi> more than enough. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest. God be with you; He that can &#x201C;wipe away all tears from our eyes.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. 7:17.</note> All tears!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<dateline><place>Templand</place>, Sunday Afternoon, / <date when="1842-04-10">10 April, 1842</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>My dear little Wife,&#x2014;</salute>Your good Letter was here with the end of breakfast; I notice with great satisfaction a tone of better health in it: I can see pretty well what health my poor Jeannie is in! All sorts of distress whatsoever, the highest as the lowest, are terribly intensated and embittered by disease of the body. I wish I could hear that you had yet got your drive accomplished. What say <hi rend="italic">you, Cousin</hi> Jeannie? The weather here is the beautifullest that can come out of the Heavens: and as for temperature decidedly rather too warm for me in the middle portions of the day!</p>
<p>The thought of <hi rend="italic">Nodes</hi> suggests Darwin&#x2019;s want of a groom and servant to me; and in the rear of that a note of interrogation over poor innocent James!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >E. Nodes&#x2019;s stables, at which James was evidently a groom.</note> Did you ever hint of that to Darwin? I know not whether James could at all be trained to do valet-work; but I know he is a very good groom, and a modest faithful-looking creature, who desires much to be a gentleman&#x2019;s servant. Pray apprise Darwin, if he be still vacant. Cousin Jeannie (in defect of all other means) has but to copy out this paragraph and send it by post to Marlbro&#x2019; Street.&#x2014; How <hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Fanny Burney (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>).</note> ever came into my hands I cannot form the faintest guess. I never read the book, never knew it;&#x2014;perhaps Darwin had recommended it and given it me?</p>
<p>Miss Wilson&#x2019;s visit is all before me. It <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have been meant as kindness: but it operates mostly as a sort of stricture of the heart! We must take thankfully what is good; forgive what of evil cannot be amended.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi>, from Craik and from John this morning, contain long reports of a new Copyright bill, not so bad after all;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420410-TC-RMM-01">TC to RMM, <date when="1842-04-10">10 April</date></ref>.</note> and likely or sure to be passed, this time. A real benefit, tho&#x2019; a small one.&#x2014; I read all that; I went wandering by the side of the River for two hours,&#x2014;the place where we two once crossed it in a flood; the small House visible where your Father and your Mother first met! They have met again now, not to part again: both in the Eternal, whither we fast follow thro&#x2019; these vortexes of Time! Courage, my poor little <pb id="pg-14-137" n="14:137"/>Partner: let us journey with faithful heart; we too may arrive well. God Most Wise shall dispose of us according to His Will. Amen.</p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>Tomorrow morning comes the Auctioneer to make up his List. I must on the spur of the moment decide as to all items whether they are to go or to stay. I never had so many things to decide upon, with such defective knowledge of them. On tuesday or tomorrow my Mother goes to Dumfries; I myself have to be there on tuesday evening to meet Adamson: I have appointed Alick or Jamie, or both if they like, to meet me with the gig there and return the same night. On the Wednesday morning early, M&#x2019;Caig and his man come to pack; I and the whole of us assisting, we hope it may be nearly finished that night. The old chairs in this room (drawingroom, where I am alone, near sunset) still give me pause: Margaret says they are partly &#x201C;worm-eaten,&#x201D; but must be mistaken: I have made up my mind that if we can get them to Chelsea at a value of 10/ each, they will be worth bringing; and so in spite of much counter-counsel, they bid fair still to be brought. But we have an enormous load; more than a cartload! We shall see. I shall <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to be awake tomorrow, and the coming days; a hugh whirlpool of a thing. Yet when I think of Moreau de St.-M&#xE9;ry, &#x201C;who gave 3,000 orders before rising from his seat,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >M. L. E.

Aitken; rather a bargain, I believe, at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi> each. Freight to Liverpool is 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> per cubic foot: each two chairs will cost about 2/6 before they get even thither. The Pickford<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A moving company.</note> charge, I will guess to be about as much more. That will perhaps still do. I wish I knew <hi rend="italic">what</hi> the amount of <hi rend="italic">your love</hi> for these poor old chairs is.</p>
<p>Margaret is a good cheery-hearted rational and most handy and punctual creature: I think she would really do well for a servant at Cheyne Row; I will not part with her till I have taken what assurance the case admits, and left fully all your messages with her.&#x2014; Poor old Mary is still at the preaching at Burnhead;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Village 1&#xBD; mi. W of Thornhill.</note> poor old body!&#x2014; I have <pb id="pg-14-138" n="14:138"/>found a poor violet bush, not yet blown; two buds are here.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Unless James do come tomorrow, and take off my Mother as if by accident, she will not be with you till Tuesday,&#x2014;when I myself have to be down by the first of the Coaches; and expect to meet Jamie or Alick or both, with the gig, or some kind of poney; and will return that same night, after transacting some affairs with Adamson.</p>

<salute>My dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your castigation of the Vandal Wakley,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >During debate on the copyright bill in the House of Commons, <date when="1842-04-06">6 April</date>, Thomas Wakley (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28425"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), M.P. for Finsbury and ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi>, opposed any change in the existing law. In a long speech he asserted that, for the last forty years, authors had been paid enough; that the old system had produced better works than any new one would; that formerly authors were not, as now, worshippers of &#x201C;the molten calf.&#x201D; He maintained the much greater value of medical advances and inventions and asked why, if fourteen years were long enough for a patent, a longer term should be allowed for literature. In his reply Milnes defended Wordsworth, whom Wakley had ridiculed; denied that copyright raised book prices; and said that literary incomes could not be compared with those of the leading men in medicine.</note> which I have read this morning. The sound of him is as that of one &#x201C;whose speech is <pb id="pg-14-139" n="14:139"/>of bullocks&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ecclus. 38:25.</note> a sound disgraceful to your Commons House, called Honourable. You did well to rebuke him. Nay the &#x201C;natural man&#x201D; (whose thoughts indeed are <hi rend="italic">enmity</hi> to God) regrets rather that instead of the whip of polished reprimand, it had not been a right leathern dog- or horse-whip, or solid American cowskin: but this, I suppose, the forms of your Hon. House would not permit. Mr Macaulay too finds that his last-year&#x2019;s excursion was on the wrong tack; that even <hi rend="italic">at</hi> the risk of smelling of the shop he had better take the common one. This Bill, not so bad a one, seems likely to pass. Thanks for the day of small things.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Zech. 4:10. In <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> Macaulay had offended many writers by opposing Talfourd&#x2019;s proposal to extend copyright from twenty-eight years to life plus sixty years. In this debate he moved an amendment to Lord Mahon&#x2019;s proposal that it should be for life plus twenty-five years, wishing it to be either for life or for forty-two years, whichever was longer. Peel eventually carried his proposal for forty-two years or life plus seven, whichever was the greater.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am here these five weeks,&#x2014;you know on what mournful errand. For the last three weeks and more, I have been as nearly as possible in perfect solitude; alone with my own ugly Self, with my own sorrows and sins which are ugly enough, and God&#x2019;s Universe which is beautiful and terrible ever as of old. It is long since I had a time so like a Sabbath: full of sadness; but not miserable, perhaps almost blessed rather. &#x201C;Blessed are the Dead&#x201D;:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. 14:13.</note> is it not even so?</p>
<p>This night is to be the last of that sort of existence. Tomorrow morning all bursts up into explosion of Packers, Carpenters &#x26;c &#x26;c; in three days more we have no longer any habitation here. The place that once well knew us &#x201C;Knows us no more again at all forever.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note></p>
<p>Often in these silent spring days have I remembered where I was last year this time;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Milnes&#x2019;s home, Fryston.</note> and converted it all into the elegiac figure (very beautiful even so, and perhaps <hi rend="italic">most</hi> beautiful so),&#x2014;as, at any time, not to speak of this time, most things turn to elegy with me: what can I do? <hi rend="italic">Unspoken</hi> elegy. This great old Earth, is she not built on silent Graves, overcanopied with silent Stars!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420404-TC-JUCH-01">TC to <sic>JCH</sic><corr>JUCH</corr>, <date when="1842-04-04">4 April</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Perhaps in some ten days more I shall return to those pavements of yours; I look on them from this distance with a kind of shudder. But the end of man is not a <hi rend="italic">thought;</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;The end of Man is an Action, and not a Thought&#x201D;:</hi> Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 155.</note> not a manufacture of unspoken elegies. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Allons</hi></foreign> [Let us go]!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-140" n="14:140"/>My poor Wife has suffered, and still suffers, from one of the sorest wounds a human heart can experience here below. We have but one Mother; no second is appointed us. If you ever went by Chelsea, it might be a kindness to call for my poor Jane.</p>

<p><salute>My Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>You are abundantly kind to me; kinder far than I deserve! Alas, the kindest thing I could ask you to do for me at present, if it but lay in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> power, would be to get well again, and be somewhat rallied and composed when, after all these tragic confusions, I get back to you again!</p>
<p>Your next Letter will come on Wednesday, when already M&#x2019;Caig and we are in the thick tumult of packing. The next after that will find me setting out for Crawford:&#x2014;what a contrast; the mean final uproar <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and the still, great, eternal side of the scene <hi rend="italic">yonder</hi>. I like to end it in that way rather than another. In sorrow itself, mere sorrow for the honourably Departed, there is something of greatness, of divineness, that renders it supportable. The rest too will pass; I have but some 3 or 4 days of it now, and then it is ended.</p>
<p>Already this forenoon I have gone thro&#x2019; one stage of it. The Auctioneer has been here with his list-papers; I have, ever since breakfast, been measuring carpets, specifying things reserved, &#x26;c, &#x26;c: the man is just gone; I have left my Mother reading down stairs. To add to our confusions, James Aitken arrived this morning at breakfast on his way to Sanquhar,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town ca. 1 mi.

<p>Why do I trouble my poor Jeannie with all those things? Truly there is no reason, no profit in so doing.

<p>Mary Mills is to get the old Kitchen bed, bedding and blankets; so Helen had ordered; wisely.

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>All along I have had a thought of sending you some word of Salutation out of this my solitude: it is in such places and circumstances that Friends far away from us become near, and we have more of their <hi rend="italic">society,</hi> in the best sense, than when the distance was hardly as many yards as it is now miles. It is such a torrid Sahara whirlpool, that of London; men&#x2019;s very thoughts cannot meet. Men have no time to <hi rend="italic">think;</hi> they have only time to scheme and work! Fate is kind even in its cruelty, to quench down the poor tumults of existence now and then, and render audible to us &#x201C;the ever-pealing hum of old Eternity&#x201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>It is long since I have had such a sorrowful but almost sacred kind of season as in these last weeks. Tonight is my last composed evening here: on the morrow all explodes into uproar of Packers, Porters, Auctioneers; and in three days more all has ended,&#x2014;no habitation for any of us here any more.</p>
<p>My company has been with poor rustic people, on most poor business, spun to the maximum of length on their part, cut short with the maximum of brevity on mine. This done, the day and the night has been all my own; I have roamed by loud-rushing waters, wild solitary hills; gone wandering and musing as I listed, as the hour gave. I have been very sad; but not miserable, far from miserable. There is something infinitely sanative in the sight, face to face, of this great Universe,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">God&#x2019;s</hi> Universe, as one&#x2019;s whole heart may discern it to be. A divine old Universe, our old mysterious Mother; of which all that can be preached and prated, in the modern and in the ancient time, is but a mockery in comparison to the <hi rend="italic">un</hi>speakable meanings of it. &#x201C;God is great&#x201D;: one really can say little more; and ought to keep silence mainly, having admitted that.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Your visit to my poor Wife was very kind, and seemed to do her real good. She warmly acknowledged it in her Letter of that day, and remarked how beautiful a thing &#x201C;humanity coupled with perfect good breeding&#x201D; was. Thanks to you, for her sake and my own. The little Liverpool Cousin declared herself charmed; had never seen &#x26;c &#x26;c. If you pass that way again before my return, it will be a new kindness to look-in a second time. This has been a sore wound for my poor little <pb id="pg-14-144" n="14:144"/>Partner; who is not of nerves to bear such affliction lightly. Her last Parent, almost her last remaining relative:&#x2014;it is but once that one can lose a Mother. Alas, and how <hi rend="italic">all men</hi>, from the beginning of creation, have been as it were born to encounter even that: it is the sharpest of calamities, and the universallest except death only! They are poor prophets that twaddle to me about the benevolence &#x26;c of the Creator: as if the unutterable unfathomable Creation had nothing else to do but constitute itself into a Soup-kitchen, and God Most High were mere President of a universal Charity Ball! In no time of history, I think, has such wretched stuff been spoken and snivelled about God,&#x2014;not even in times when they called him Moloch and Baal. Woden was worthy twenty gods of the sort they have in Exeter Hall.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >372 Strand, founded <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>, opened <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>, for concerts, meetings and lectures, usually religious.</note> Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But I must quit all that; all that is far from my task at present. In some ten days more I may be in London: shall I not hope to see you straightway? <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mill; I love you always!&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>My Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>A few minutes before setting off for Dumfries I write you a line. The Carpets are all up, the chairs all piled; I have been over the whole House, assorting it as I could, and all is now flying with dust and uproar, except this little room whither I have retired,&#x2014;which was once hers! There is a poor little miniature set of corner-shelves here, where phials &#x26;c stood, which is almost a portrait of her: the top shelf looks as if it were framed in with a fine bit of japanned metal: on lifting it up, you find it is the handle of some broken cann! In other hands it would have been rubbish; here it is a piece of beautiful human order, working on the poorest means; to me more beautiful than or-moulu were. Our poor good Mother!&#x2014; I have taken all the phials &#x26;c, and wrapt them up for Dr Russell. The Russells sent here this morning a fine active lad, &#x201C;Wull Fingland&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Later the Russells&#x2019; servant and coachman, and set up by them in business as a chemist in Thornhill.</note> whom <hi rend="italic">she</hi> often liked to employ: he has been working all morning under my orders. Margaret, a most swift, cheery, affectionate, expert woman has him now in command, beating carpets &#x26;c. Poor old Mary sits alone in the kitchen watching a big <pb id="pg-14-145" n="14:145"/>roast, to serve on the day of Sale. I have picked out tin covers, teapots, all kinds of miscellanies I could discover that looked fit: the scuttle, kettle, two jellypans &#x26;c are laid out against tomorrow. No tea-<hi rend="italic">urns</hi> are discoverable here; a big copper-kettle with basis and heater, and a smaller one (too small even for me alone) are what Margaret thinks you must mean.&#x2014; The Drawing-room is set apart for collecting all the things not to be sold. On the day of Sale it will be locked. M&#x2019;Caig and his man come tomorrow morning at 8: with Alick, perhaps Jamie, with Fingland, Margaret and myself we shall contrive to get thro&#x2019; it. The chrystal is all set out; we will do what we can at getting it packed, effectually. The chairs and sofa remain in suspense till after Thursday; and are perhaps likeliest to be sold. Part of the computation will depend on what Walker of the Dumfries Steamer can say to me respecting freights and railway fares tonight; the rest must be a chance of sale:&#x2014;value 10/ at Chelsea, I decide that they may be brought.</p>
<p>I wrote to John Mill last night, and an answer of a Note to John: I had gone roaming far and wide in the twilight after they all went away: up to near Dabton<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1&#xBD; mi. N of Thornhill.</note> by Nithbank, then back into the country towards Merton Kirk, along by which I thought I knew a road that would take me home without passing thro&#x2019; the Village: my path at last among the woods and ditches grew rather complex; I had two hours of it in all,&#x2014;but the blessing of perfect solitude under the blessed silent stars: the clear <hi rend="italic">sky</hi>, inextinguishably bright after all storms and defacements, puts always new life into me. It is impossible to believe that He who made that can mean unbountifully with us, can mean other than well with us, dark as His ways often are.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my poor Wife: what more can I write at present? I have orders to write to M&#x2019;Caig; I have to dress yet; and my minutes here are numbered. My love to the fair Cousin; whose popularity among your friends is very gratifying to me. My blessings on you both. Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>Unless I can reach Thornhill before 8 o&#x2019;clock (which is doubtful) and throw this in there, you will get nothing from me till Monday; an interval of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> days.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-146" n="14:146"/>About nine this morning I came off: your Letter met me on the <foreign>brae</foreign>; I had finished Harriet&#x2019;s too before they got the gig across the Burn. A cold bitter Northwind blew right in my face all the way hither; it is now changed to the <hi rend="italic">South</hi> with rain,&#x2014;ready to meet me the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> way. But I have my Mackintosh.</p>
<p>I have spent two hours on <hi rend="italic">the place:</hi> all is composed there into decent regularity, and lies overlooked by the old wilderness as in everlasting rest. I have copied the Inscription <foreign><hi rend="italic">lineatim;</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Indicating the lines; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420419-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-04-19">19 April</date></ref>.</note> I thought you would like to see it that way too. I also copied your Grandfather&#x2019;s memorial; evidently composed by <hi rend="italic">her</hi>. The man has cut the letters deep, correct and very well,&#x2014;excellently well as lettering goes in this quarter: one or two mistakes of points (one especially affecting the <hi rend="italic">sense</hi>, to a <hi rend="italic">grammarian</hi>) I could not bear to leave; I went to the nearest farm-house (close by), borrowed a chisel and hammer, and succeeded in making it all correct. The stone stands level, firm, raised by six pillarets upon-another which is flat, horizontal, and level with the ground: Grandfather and Grandmother, and then a <hi rend="italic">Great</hi> Grandmother (I think; of date <date when="1737-00-00">1737</date>) lie successively farther to the south. One Ewe and her little blackfaced lamb were the only living things visible about the spot. The Clyde rolled by, its everlasting course; the Northwind was moaning thro&#x2019; some score of trees that stand on the <hi rend="italic">opposite</hi> side of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gottes-Acker</hi></foreign> [God&#x2019;s Acre] (what a name, a right name!)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The burial ground is ca. 2 mi. N of Crawford, just off the A74, on the E side.</note>&#x2014;the old Hills rise mournful, desolate, pure and strong all round;&#x2014;I could see Castlemains from the spot.&#x2014; I had also passed <hi rend="italic">Glengeith</hi>, where your Grandmother nighted (with <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, among the rest) on the way to Caplegill: I think the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> house is still standing.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had travelled N, through the Dalveen Pass; Castlemains farm, where Grace Welsh was born, is &#xBD; mi.

TC writes that JWC had been &#x201C;much about&#x201D; the district and homes of her maternal grandfather Walter &#x201C;from her early childhood&#x201D; and that she paid &#x201C;summer visits almost yearly; and, after her Father&#x2019;s death, likely to be of longer continuance. &#x2026; To myself &#x2026; there was a real gain from them&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 106).</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>. I have much to do when I get home yet.&#x2014; The packing was all well effected; and five mats left. The chairs (which I think are still not unlikely to come) will of course need more.</p>
<p>You must address, next, to Scotsbrig. I believe I shall hardly get much sleep or composure till I arrive there.</p>

<p><salute>My Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>Here in this old garret of Isabella&#x2019;s, but with quiet round me and the pure sunshine sleeping on Burnswark, I can again write you a word. We got here, Jamie and I, leaving Alick at Ecclefechan, past eleven last night; with our utmost dispatch we could not get the ruined Templand locked, or made ready for locking, till three in the afternoon. I left the key with Margaret; the Auctioneer residues and unfinishable tagrags with Dr Russell till my return,&#x2014;for I must again return whenever &#x201C;the Duke&#x2019;s permission&#x201D; to close Jardine&#x2019;s bargain <hi rend="italic">finally</hi> arrives: a few hours will then be sufficient for terminating all things;&#x2014;and probably I shall be in no haste to revisit that country! Margaret wept as I shook hands with her among the straw of Templand kitchen; I myself was not far from tears: in my whole life I have seen no wretcheder scene of pain and sorrow, and the final <hi rend="italic">cataract</hi> of all confusions and distresses to heart, to soul and to body. I have now got a sleep; the first for four nights: my head is full of dull pain, with all the <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign> of such a situation; but I am quiet now, I shall of course get round again, and be wholly myself, very speedily here.</p>
<p>For two things, dear Wife, I will thank God: first that the horrible &#x201C;<foreign>roup</foreign>&#x201D; [sale] <hi rend="italic">is</hi> all over; secondly that thou wert not there, or near it; I think it would have broken thy heart. It is, as I say, a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> death, on the broader scale: the spirit that had presided over Templand house and made it lovely and kindly was gone far away, and so the house had to fall into nameless wreck of dissolution too. How beautiful, sweet in its very sternness of sorrow, still and pure as Eternity, was Crawford Churchyard, compared with what met me on my return! But no more of it: God be thanked, it is done; and no such scene we hope lies again before us in this world.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; The things had sold what they called &#x201C;tolerably,&#x201D;&#x2014;which I think may well be defined as rather <hi rend="italic">ill:</hi> the gross produce of all things, and of such tumult in dispersing them, was some &#xa3;70; which, deducting the expenses and accidents, will perhaps net in all &#xa3;60! My regret sometimes was that I had not gathered all the things together; given away whatsoever could have been desirable to any friend of hers or of ours, and left the remainder to the Minister and Kirk Session for the Poor, or burnt it on the hilltop with pure fire. But that too was not the right way. Things sold as they could; the country was extensively gathered together, nothing was mismanaged, we took the chance of the country (in great money-distress at <pb id="pg-14-148" n="14:148"/>present), and realised <hi rend="italic">this</hi>. The rubbish, they say, sold best; things of any value seem to have gone at perhaps the third part of their real worth, at perhaps the tenth of their original cost. No matter, really none at all. Had the money produced been twenty pounds more they would have called it a really good sale; producing twice as much it would have been a miraculously excellent sale: and yet what better had <hi rend="italic">we</hi> been? The confusion, the desperate chaotic horror of the thing to one&#x2019;s heart had been all the same. Thank God it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> done.</p>
<p>The old chairs are saved, nobody offered for them what I had <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> on (I am right glad of it); the sofa, which I did not like, is off. The old table of the green room toilette is bought for Jenny, and goes to Gill. Mrs Black did not buy the cow, and stopped bidding at a very low value indeed: Jamie had guessed the beast at &#xa3;10, or allowing for Peel&#x2019;s-tariff and the cattle-panic here,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peel&#x2019;s proposed reduction of the tariff on imported cattle as part of his stringent financial measures (see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420513-TC-HMS-01">TC to HMS, <date when="1842-05-13">13 May</date></ref>) was presumably causing the fall in cattle prices.</note> at &#xa3;8; Mrs B. stopt at &#xa3;6; the cow was bought by Alick at &#xa3;7.8. It was Jamie&#x2019;s opinion that Mrs B. had wanted to get a <hi rend="italic">gift</hi> of the animal; she behaved, according to his notions, rather unpleasantly and in no friendly spirit during the course of the sale. Alick offered her the cow; but she would not hear of it.&#x2014; The original old <hi rend="italic">oven</hi> of the Kitchen was sold, at the <hi rend="italic">half</hi>-price of old iron, to a scoundrel who had neither money nor credit: it is coming here to Scotsbrig,&#x2014;which also I am glad of. They have bought about a cartload of insignificant things, Alick and Jamie, for themselves and for Jenny: Jamie Austin is to go and fetch them on Monday.</p>
<p>For London the chosen articles lie packed in 18 large masses: your Uncle warning the railway man at Liverpool, as proper precautions too are taken at the Steamer on the Dumfries side, they have a good chance to arrive safe. They are in general, I imagine, <hi rend="italic">well</hi> packed; tho&#x2019; everything is scattered thro&#x2019; every other in a most chaotic way (pieces of one article here, <hi rend="italic">small</hi> iron pieces &#x26;c, I mean, and others there), yet I think there is little or nothing absolutely lost. The hardware things or rather the <hi rend="italic">iron</hi> and <hi rend="italic">metal</hi> things are all in one little barrel, scuttle, kettle, jelly-pan &#x26;c; the glass and china are in two little boxes, packed with M&#x2019;C&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >M&#x2019;Caig&#x2019;s.</note> best skill, and <hi rend="italic">new</hi>-roped by us on friday. All, in short, is as well as we could make it. The Carriers (two to be sent by the Steamer people from Dumfries) take them away on Thursday next, on Friday morning they are shipped, this day week they are at Liverpool; and I suppose may reach Chelsea in some 3 days more.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-149" n="14:149"/>The Bargain with the Jardines I got, by dint of high-pressure energy, reduced to the state I wanted it in; namely ready for closing in an instant, were &#x201C;the Duke&#x2019;s permission&#x201D; once here. The Duke does not write. I left a Letter with Russel (to be sent off today, in case no Duke&#x2019;s answer arrived) urging him to do it. They all say it is safe; I wish it may prove so,&#x2014;safe and speedy!</p>
<p>To Margaret I gave 3 guineas with which she seemed well content: your Uncle had already given her a similar sum, as present or <hi rend="italic">vails</hi> (this I understood from Russell); many small <foreign>etceteras</foreign> fell to her share at last; and we parted, as I told you, in tears. She is a good creature, and full of talent as a servant. I design still to give her another sovereign: but it will be as a gift to her two little girls at parting,&#x2014;with <hi rend="italic">wages</hi> I liked to be somewhat nearer to <hi rend="italic">exactness</hi>, as we may happen to have more of them to pay this woman. Her wages are some 4 guineas a half-year; or rather used to be, for she means not to hire again in that quarter, but &#x201C;at London or Liverpool!&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Monster W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Grahame, absent all this while at Glasgow, pounces upon me here and now with his old exactness! I can add no more tonight. I will try to get you another word sent tomorrow or else next day. Do not thou, my poor Jeannie, <hi rend="italic">afflict</hi> thyself writing daily to me; take it easier,&#x2014;a sick day can be omitted <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. That poor head: Heaven send it were well,&#x2014;and the heart it belongs to! <closer><salute>Blessings on <hi rend="italic">both</hi> Jeannies. Ever your affectionate,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>John, as you perhaps know, is over to France; to Havre where they mean to spend the summer: he has to be back in London first however,&#x2014;if I mistake not. The weather here <hi rend="italic">is</hi> now cold enough; except with warm clothes and swift walking.</p>
<p>The poor little black desk has been mine all along, and is packed even now into my trunk among the Scotsbrig goods at Templand. a little white teapot <hi rend="italic">is</hi> in,&#x2014;may it be safe.</p></ps>

<dateline><place>Scotsbrig</place>, Sunday <date when="1842-04-17">17 April / 1842</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>My dear good Wife,&#x2014;</salute>They are all off to &#x201C;the Preaching,&#x201D; and have left me quiet here; I may as well write you a word at my leisure, before going out into the silent sunshine on the moor. The <hi rend="italic">Cock</hi> (sorrow to all cocks!) awoke me this morning at six; so I am not very well: but they are to confine <hi rend="italic">him</hi> for the future, and by the grace of the country <pb id="pg-14-150" n="14:150"/>and the season, I shall be at the old mark again or beyond it, before long.&#x2014; Our unfortunate Craigenputtoch shower-bath too, even that is now to do me service again. It stood uninjured in the peat-house at Templand; nobody would offer money for it at the Sale: I have found a closet here for it, and hope to have a right swash, and my skin made clean by it, on Wednesday morning and the following ones!&#x2014; Jamie too thinks he can borrow me a tolerable horse. I shall await &#x201C;the Duke&#x2019;s permission&#x201D; with as much composure as I can, perhaps not without profit even. This however, this of the Duke, is all along the most questionable point with me, and I still look for its misgoing;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; probably that is but the effect of biliary humour in myself. But to be ready either way! I mean to see James Stewart,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Hope Stewart.</note> and learn authentically what it is the Duke can do, doing his worst. I have determined to be <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> of Templand, and hear of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> no more at any rate. The whole matter at issue therefore, I fancy, is some net sum of money, viz. &#xa3;100; that is all I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> lose,&#x2014;and my quiet shall not go along with that. It is not indispensable for me, as I have felt always, and occasionally said, to make out of Templand a few pounds of money more or less; but it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> important and indispensable that I do nothing irrational, dishonourable, ungenerous or improper there; but <hi rend="italic">end</hi> the business in the spirit in which it was always carried on by those who have now no representative but me. This we shall endeavour after: their Duke too ought to endeavour after it (at least not to endeavour the other way), and perhaps will,&#x2014;but we must be ready to let him take his choice withal. No more of him, the poor harmless Duke, who, when I think of it, has himself yet done <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>; but has been made a hateful bugbear of, to my imagination, by the poor people that worship him there for a livelihood! Perhaps it is an excellent Duke: we shall see.</p>
<p>Among the things forgotten yesterday was, to tell you that, in passing up to Crawford near the end of the hamlet, I saw Peggy M&#x2019;Queen spreading clothes upon a stone dike by the way side, and called to her, tho&#x2019; I saw she wished rather to avoid me. Poor numb Peggy! She was in waiting for me as I returned; got into the gig at my request, and accompanied me as far as Elvanfoot.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 2 mi. S of Crawford.</note> She gave me some details, which tho&#x2019; indistinct I will treasure up for you. She had arrived a few minutes before the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> shock, which occurred unexpectedly some three weeks before the <hi rend="italic">last</hi>, and of which we never heard: it was <hi rend="italic">her</hi> express order not to have it spoken of at all. Margaret in the gig described the situation to me. This, my poor Jeannie, will again smite sharply against your heart: your dear Mother, when seized with what she herself took <pb id="pg-14-151" n="14:151"/>to be death, said as she sank down on the chair: &#x201C;Peggy I am dying&#x2014; O my poor Jeannie!&#x201D;&#x2014; She had spoken of you too that last night while she walked so long: &#x201C;Well, I think if I had a room 30 feet long, and Jeannie to walk beside me!&#x201D; The poor Mother! Generous affection dwelt in that heart to its final pulse; her last feeling in this earth was of Love and Hope. She is gone to God, who made her and made us; may we follow in the like spirit!&#x2014; I again make you weep, my poor Wife, whom I would save from all weeping if I could; but they are not bitter tears those; they are soft and sanative.</p>
<p>Poor Harriett Martineau seems to me, from her Letter that you sent, to be very ill and miserable. If I knew in what style to address that true heart, true tho&#x2019; hedged in with so many limitations to me unmanageable, I would write to her again one of these days. Poor Harriett: I fear she too is dying!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She was to live till <date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>. She was genuinely ill though not as seriously as she supposed; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410928-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1841-09-28">28 Sept. 1841</date></ref>, and R. K. Webb, <hi rend="italic">Harriet Martineau, A Radical Victorian</hi> (<date when="1960-00-00">1960</date>) 193&#x2013;200.</note> We shall not readily look upon her like again.&#x2014; Why should I end so sadly! I will end in hope: hope to see my poor Jeannie soon again, and to be worthier of her for all these sorrows. <closer><salute>God keep thee, Dearest!</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>

<p><salute>My dear Wife,&#x2014;</salute>Tho&#x2019; I have no history here, and happily for the present can have none, I will still write you a line, were it about nothing. This morning I had given up your Letter: Alick was to have a boy here with it, if there were a Letter, before nine o&#x2019;clock; he himself brought it (with a bit of mutton he had purchased for me!) about eleven; and before that, I had gone into the fields, and at my return he was gone, and it lay there  One of the <hi rend="italic">least</hi> punctual of all men!&#x2014; The <foreign><hi rend="italic">Stimabile</hi></foreign> had not franked the Letter, as he might have done; but it was right welcome, and the more so as arriving now beyond hope.</p>
<p>Jeannie&#x2019;s dream is very correct; I would certainly pack you both out of doors, unless the weather be much sharper than we have it here. But you are getting better, I can see, for all that. Go on that way, my Dearest; there is nothing in the world that will please me so well.</p>
<p>Poor wearisome Grahame, the only articulate man I have spoken with since my arrival here, reported that all went fast towards despondency or sheer despair about Glasgow (except his own daily dinners, which he almost bored me to death with): people withdrawing &#x201C;from <pb id="pg-14-152" n="14:152"/>houses into flats&#x201D;; putting down carriages,&#x2014;not wotting what to do: Paisley streets alive only with soup-kitchen pensioners travelling with their hafpenny and cann: all things looking bodeful, big with misery to great masses of men. He spoke, most gratefully towards <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, about his little print;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of John Greig&#x2019;s house at Canandaigua.</note> spoke about his own Mother, &#x26;c: an affectionate, good, tho&#x2019; now most wearisome man. He bargained for a day at Burnswark; but that I shall take care to avoid. My authentic Donothingism here is far preferable to any entertainment the choicest Master of Ceremonies could contrive for me. I have today strolled over the moor, watched Jamie and his boy burning of weed-heaps; I have also sorted my Mother&#x2019;s Books into really handsome order (the very book-shelves were down, and difficult to fix): I have likewise smoked three good pipes, read about a half of <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> (a work quite new to me!); and dined upon 3 ounces of the fore quarter of a hen and soup. My sick nerves will get sound again. That is my way of life.</p>
<p>Jamie Austin is probably about this hour coming down near Auldgarth Bridge, with two light cartloads of lumber, purchased (or left unpurchaseable, owing to a blackguard who had no money, and yet bought, and so had to give them up) from the ruins of poor Templand. He will be here tomorrow,&#x2014;with at least my Trunk: if with no other satisfaction to me. The Cow comes either to Scotsbrig or to Gill; Alick is not to keep her, having already a cow. Two sugar-loaves (did I tell you?) with a heap of chocolate were left for Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> M&#x2019;Queen with Margaret, the wine needed no giving away; they had drank five bottles during the Sale, and left only two which I brought hither. All the porter too was drunk then (not quite a dozen of it), two gallons of ale, a gallon and half of whisky&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Pfui</hi>! I left Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to take charge of all that; which he did: nay I fancy <hi rend="italic">it</hi> would take care of itself. Under the sun is no horribler thing than a &#x201C;Public <foreign>Roup</foreign>&#x201D; under those circumstances. Thou there, my Dear? I would not for all the furniture in Scotland have had thee there.</p>
<p>I am glad to think the old red chairs are coming: they will even please my taste better than any chairs, in that old drawingroom of ours. Thou shalt buy a right sofa or ottoman,&#x2014;long enough for me to lie on, at any rate. I mean also to have poor Grandfather&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Welsh&#x2019;s.</note> old desk appropriated to my own use; to keep my <hi rend="italic">business</hi> papers in (as well as my shirts): I really need such a thing. It strikes me also that we must have a <hi rend="italic">window</hi> broken out in that dressingroom of mine; that I must sit there and write in the fireless season. Speak about it (to Perry<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carpenter and builder, Lawrence St., Chelsea.</note> <pb id="pg-14-153" n="14:153"/>this must be, I suppose), if there is opportunity. I wish I had given away the old blue hangings of the dining room: they many an evening gave me mournful and yet soft thoughts; they were evidently all by <hi rend="italic">her</hi>. Nay some one <hi rend="italic">has</hi> got them all but <hi rend="italic">given,</hi>&#x2014;and I am not troubled with any claim of &#x201C;gratitude&#x201D; &#x26;c for <hi rend="italic">giving</hi> them: it <hi rend="italic">has</hi> gone so, even by &#x201C;Public <foreign>Roup</foreign>.&#x201D; It is better that a human being, even a rude unthankful one, should get use of our good Mother&#x2019;s things, now that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> needs them no more, than that Fire should burn them! Let us be pacified.</p>
<p>I think if &#x201C;the Duke&#x201D; hang back too long, I will perhaps run for Thomas Erskine&#x2019;s? Yet that will not do well either; for I should have to return.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Tomorrow is equivalent to your Sunday,&#x2014;or rather tomorrow morning is; but at night I may have a Letter. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> Dearest: love me either for genius or what thou wilt, but love me!&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T.C.</name></p>
<ps><p>Poor Scotsbrig primroses; tussilago<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Also called coltsfoot.</note> that grows on desart sandbeds, and yet is wholesome!</p></ps>

<p><salute>My Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>I have been mending (without tools!) the hinge of a door which awoke me by its creaking last night, and my hand is none of the steadiest at present. This is, on the whole, altogether a Troglodyte life that I lead here, and I shall wish soon I were back into some sort of civilization again. The women last night were superintending some cow in a peculiar situation; going out with their hay-tea, they awoke me by that hinge,&#x2014;the more the pity, poor sluts! I had fallen into sleep, soft and deep and speedy, being thoroughly in want of sleep; and that creak set me up for two miserable hours, well that it did not for the whole night. I have still my leeway to make good in that matter; three nights <hi rend="italic">minus</hi>, the wretchedest that I remember for a considerable time.</p>
<p>Last night a Boy sent over with the Letter for you, brought me your Chelsea one of friday, which had gone round by Thornhill; the Saturday one, which came hither, was already answered. We are now some 18 hours nearer one another: if you wrote to me on Monday, I shall get your letter this evening (22 hours after it leaves London, 26 after Chelsea), and there are 2 mails a-day. I must have my sleep again, however, before I can profit by anything.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-154" n="14:154"/>The shower-bath with the other things was found standing here this morning at 6; Austin had travelled all night, and slunk into some kind of outhouse bed when he arrived. The sight of the poor Templand lumber again made me altogether sad; but it is the last sight of the kind now. The little black Desk, with many little traces of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> still in it, and carefully preserved by me, is here safe, now serving me to write upon: the bottle of yellow drying-dust had unluckily been ill stopped, and had shaken out its contents; but by care, patience, and working with a pair of bellows I cleared all out again; and the poor little Desk is perfectly right now. One of &#x201C;the blackguard&#x2019;s articles&#x201D; turns out to have been the Table that stood by the <hi rend="italic">wall</hi> in the dining-room; properly the middle part of a long table the two ends of which made the dining table there. I was rather glad he had left it. It is now my Mother&#x2019;s: the two <hi rend="italic">ends</hi> had been purchased by Alick. I had brought the whisky-bottle away; I have given it to my Mother, the only person I was sure of not having it <hi rend="italic">abused</hi> in the way of drinking! And now surely all these melancholy things <hi rend="italic">are</hi> at length disposed of, and our heart will not be hurt with the sad shadow of them any more.</p>
<p>The Shower-bath stands erect in front of the house here; it will not enter either closet or room door, or even stand for height, if it had entered! A joiner is to come tomorrow, to take it in piecemeal, and rip up a bit of the garret-floor to give it space: I have agreed to spend two more shillings on it, and to leave it there,&#x2014;as a fixture in Scotsbrig house, for the <hi rend="italic">shell</hi> of it will never come out more, except piecemeal again.&#x2014; By the bye, I have been thinking, since you have got that reasonable joiner, we will have a canvas shell made round that shower-bath of our own: the effect of the thing will be immensely improved by it, and it will not cost many shillings.</p>
<p>Cromwell sometimes rises upon me here; but as a thing lost in abysses; a thing sunk beyond the horizon, and only throwing up a sad twilight of remembrance! I sometimes think I will pack all Fuz&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster&#x2019;s.</note> books together at my return, and send <hi rend="italic">them</hi> away: I never yet was in the right track to do that Book. Yet Cromwell is with me the fit subject of a Book, could I only say of what Book! I must yet hang by <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. But indeed, if I live, a new epoch will have to unfold itself with me; there <hi rend="italic">are</hi> new things, and as yet no new dialect for them. The time of my youth is past; that of my age is not yet fully come. Patience! I am dreadfully lazy too.</p>
<p>No &#x201C;Duke&#x2019;s answer&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">can</hi> arrive, I suppose, till the end of this week. It is a wonderful relief to me that I am here got fairly out of the choking <pb id="pg-14-155" n="14:155"/>sycophant Duke-element, which tempted me at every turn to exclaim, &#x201C;May the Devil and his grandmother fly away with your shabble of a Duke! What, in God&#x2019;s name have I to do with him? All the Dukes in Creation melted into one Duke were not worth sixpence to me!&#x201D;&#x2014; I declare I could not live there at all in such an accursed soul-oppressing puddle of a Dukery.&#x2014; It seems the man&#x2019;s tenants, before long, are likely to be most of them ready for bankruptcy, in this side of the world; and with his new Chamberlain &#x201C;that has no power&#x201D; he is like to make a precious kettle of fish, Grahame hears! I still, whether from bile or no, think it very possible he may <hi rend="italic">refuse</hi> to let Jardine and me bargain in that way: we shall be ready for either event.</p>

Yes; I have sent you all things: I find that the best plan.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your punctuality and other kindness; thanks to his Grace for answering so civilly,&#x2014;for answering at all!</p>
<p>I have written to Mr Hunter of Morton Mill to do what you counsel, so far as possible, so soon as possible.</p>
<p>It is not, I believe, in the power of any living person to make out a detailed specification of improvements at Templand: those who accomplished that long operation, my Mother-in-Law, her Father, her Sister, are all gone to the land of Silence; and of us that survive, nobody I apprehend ever turned a practical thought to the matter, or knows more of it than I do, which is simply as good as nothing. Hunter himself, till two years ago, only saw the matter from afar, and is without specific knowledge of it. We can only say in the gross: &#x201C;To converting Templand out of black sluttish squalor into trimness, comfort and elegance&#x201D;&#x2014;so many pounds sterling! To yourself the best proof that the claim is grounded will perhaps be this fact, that the Farm as now let, together with the house as capable of being let, will jointly <pb id="pg-14-157" n="14:157"/>yield &#xa3;15 a-year more than the rent paid for it; that I meant to let Jardine have it at an equivalent for &#xa3;10 a-year more (being advised that it was too tight for him at &#xa3;15), which sum he will cheerfully give, and consider the bargain as a benefit.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> certainly shall consider his Grace preferable as paymaster to any Jardine!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If you will be so very obliging as cooperate with Mr Hunter in expediting this affair; so that, instantly on getting notice that all lies ready, I may hasten up to Thornhill once more, to sign and to finish, and thereupon to get back to my own place and my own business, it will be a great kindness shewn me.</p>
<p><closer><salute>I remain / Dear Sir, / Yours very truly</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>I have fled down stairs to Isabella&#x2019;s room, to be out of the infatuated Grahame, who two hours ago, since I did not come to him, came to me, and is sitting over <hi rend="italic">Luther&#x2019;s Table Talk</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It might have been one of several trans. such as the anon. <hi rend="italic">Luther&#x2019;s Table Talk, or Some Choice Fragments from the Familiar Discourse &#x2026; of Dr. Martin Luther</hi> (<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>).

Was there ever such a mortal? He had got a &#x201C;spicy pamphlet&#x201D; on the Non-Intrusion Question,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Scotland nonintrusion was the principle that a minister might not be appointed to a parish against the will of the congregation.</note> &#x201C;written altogether in my style&#x201D;; which Grierson of Kirkbean<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> and all people asserted to be in verity <hi rend="italic">mine!</hi> I read a bit of it: my <hi rend="italic">style</hi> indeed; the contorsions of the Sibyl; but her inspiration?&#x2014; We will leave poor Grahame.</p>
<p>I got no Letter from you last night; but a Newspaper with two strokes kept me at peace. I had a Letter, however, from Maxwell the Duke&#x2019;s Chamberlain who has no power: the Duke, fearful of introducing troublesome example into his estates, is obliged to decline granting me the requested liberty <hi rend="italic">in that particular way;</hi> but will do what Maxwell thinks will turn out to be equivalent: accept my renunciation of the lease, and pay me for whatever improvements M. shall verify to be due. M. directs me how to proceed: I have proceeded accordingly; I imagine it will turn out all well, tho&#x2019; with a few days longer <pb id="pg-14-158" n="14:158"/>delay. M. is very civil, and I have set Hunter to work in the way he suggests. I rejoice greatly in the prospect of getting done with that thing.&#x2014; Tonight too there will be a letter from <hi rend="italic">you?</hi></p>
<p>My sleep has not yet come well back; and the weather is <hi rend="italic">too sultry</hi> for getting exercise conveniently. But the old Shower-bath has veritably had 2 shillings more laid out on it; and after being all in pieces (to get it into the place) is all up again, as right as ever, and I have had a very beneficial swash in it after dinner an hour ago. Shall we not have our own covered with canvas, and free scope to wash ourselves there?&#x2014;</p>
<p>James Stewart sent down a Boy: tomorrow is Lockerbie Fair, and we cannot meet at Gill; but are to take Friday, and dine in his establishment at Kinmont.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stewart was the Marquess of Queensberry&#x2019;s agent with a permanent apartment in Kinmont House.</note> He is very courteous and obliging this Stewart, and far the sensiblest man I meet in Dumfriesshire.</p>
<p>Have you heard that the Murderer Good was taken up in Dumfries on Monday evening last? It is perfectly true that a man singing ballads on the street, in clothes liker a groom&#x2019;s than a ballad-singer&#x2019;s, and of most sinister aspect, was taken up; and refused to speak one word more or less: the town was in hurlyburly round him as Austin passed thro&#x2019;; Alick too had seen the same man ballad-singing at Ecclefechan, and Jamie Aitken had met him on the heights of Dalton. It will be curious should it prove he. I read last night for the first time some of the details of that business: one of the horridest I ever heard of; it sticks in one&#x2019;s imagination with a kind of hideous pain. Such a man ought decidedly to be hanged: I think Mazzini himself will hardly undertake the &#x201C;education&#x201D; of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. The poor Wife! It is all a hideous tragedy.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The dismembered body of a young woman had been found, <date when="1842-04-06">6 April</date>, in a stables in Roehampton, London. The murderer, Daniel Good, evaded capture but was arrested, <date when="1842-04-16">16 April</date>, at Tonbridge, Kent, and executed, <date when="1842-05-23">23 May</date>.</note></p>
<p>A large bundle of papers from Adamson<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Adamson.</note> lie here for examining; I must attack them tomorrow. His affairs with me are nearly put in order; but these are the documents of them, which I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to understand but do not yet. I have, as Mill says, no love in the world for business; and it requires a great struggle to rouse my mind into grappling with it. A man is unhappy whose work is not his pastime too, in a certain sense;&#x2014;the toil he <hi rend="italic">loves</hi> to toil at. Often when I thought of these Dukes &#xa3;100 and wretched sales by Auction, I have felt tempted to say: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wozu</hi></foreign> [For what]? And yet a second thought teaches me that had the hundred pounds been a million the essence of <pb id="pg-14-159" n="14:159"/>the business were all the same,&#x2014;to finish reason<supplied>[ab]</supplied>ly and honourably what was all along reasonably and honourably carried on by them that are now gone to their Eternity and do rest with God: that was the important point! O my Darling, as you say, What has Templand or any other land to do with <hi rend="italic">them?</hi> One&#x2019;s soul worships them: blessed are the Dead that die well.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I will add no more at all tonight, but seal my Letter, and be ready for a twilight walk. Do Jeannie and you really never <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> go out? Write me all your little history; your callers, your &#x26;c &#x26;c. <closer><salute>Good be with you both, poor Jeannies.

<p><salute>My dear Wifie,&#x2014;</salute>It would be a shame not to write half a word to you tonight, now that your Letter of yesterday (of Wednesday) is come; for it will be almost the only good thing I have contrived to get done today. I have shower-bathed, I have dozen on the sofa, wandered over the moor, written a brief necessary Message to America;&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">am one day older</hi> but neither better, bonnier, nor in any way richer in temporal or spiritual goods. Patience: I have never yet recovered my sleep; I am in the <hi rend="italic">physic</hi> line now, and shall gradually recover. A dirty continual headache and uttermost powerless laziness oppress me for the for the<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> present. One can only say, it is as good nearly as hearing of Scott Lectures, or attending Cowance parties!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. J.

Julia Strachey, b.

<p>You need not be very apprehensive about the things being injured by carriage: I expect them to turn out very tolerably packed, and to be carried with more care than in the Craigenputtoch case. They will get into the Steamer tomorrow morning, under the eye of the Clerk; and a Railway agent waits at Liverpool, as I understand, to take charge of them there.&#x2014; I have the two keys of the wardrobe here, which will be the first article you must open: the other keys are stuck into drawers &#x26;c, wherever a hole for them could be found. If I myself am not to <pb id="pg-14-160" n="14:160"/>get up in something like time, I will wrap these two keys in wash-leather, and send them by post.</p>
<p>If Helen<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell.</note> plague you with any more of her nonsense, do not endure it; instruct me to hire Margaret Hiddleston straightway, and I believe I can manage that. She seems to me a decidedly superior servant to Helen in all particulars whatsoever, and spoke more then once as if she would decidedly rather like to undertake London under your guidance. Her temper seemed excellent; in shifty assiduity, care, expertness she resembled Grace Macdonald,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles&#x2019; maid, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351012-JWC-TC-01"><sic>8:223</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1835-10-12">12 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> yet with a smiling affectionate face;&#x2014;a little too much <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> of voice, and disposition to talk Nithsdale (which was easily repressed too) was the one slight annoyance of her to me, among innumerable good qualities, and helpfulness continued under all circumstances. Certainly we will not lose sight of her:&#x2014;if at the <hi rend="italic">inevitable</hi> moment she were not procurable it would be a great annoyance. Decide and write; there will be time probably before I return to Thornhill, to finish there. I told Marg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> what Helen&#x2019;s fault was;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Drunkenness.</note> and that it was very likely we <hi rend="italic">should</hi> want her (M<hi rend="italic">t</hi>) some day or other.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I have to meet Stewart at Gill; today as I think I told you, would not do. It has been <hi rend="italic">so warm</hi> today, that I have stript to my silk waistcoat, and must peel a new pair of drawers or the like, next time I walk. Why does not Cousin Jeannie remember Nodes and the carriage now? Why do you not, Cousin Jeannie!

<dateline><place>Scotsbrig</place>, Saturday Evening, <date when="1842-04-23">23 April / 1842</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My dear Wife,</salute>
<p>Your letter of yesterday comes to me just now, after tea; your Thursday one I got about two hours ago as I passed thro&#x2019; Ecclefechan. It is verily only 22 hours that the Letters take in travelling; but this, for example, that I am now writing will not get away from Ecclefechan till tomorrow morning at 5 o&#x2019;clock; and if the poor little Postmaster be wearied and neglectful, it will lie with him till 2 next day, and so not reach you till the following <hi rend="italic">evening</hi>. Let us rejoice in such a penny-postage, with all its inequalities, and make diligent use of it to one another. Thanks to you for writing two such long nice letters; they are right satisfactory for me to read here. I do not wish you to &#x201C;get up your spirits again&#x201D; in the way poor Mrs S.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Hester Sterling.</note> recommends. No; I do not see the basis of such a proceeding as that. One&#x2019;s &#x201C;spirits&#x201D; in such a case have a good right to continue <hi rend="italic">low</hi>. Sad thoughts <hi rend="italic">belong</hi> to those that have left us here; sad, but soft and pious: I find it good to look sorrow steadily in the face, and admit first of all that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> exceeding sorrowful. You have behaved yourself in this sore trial, my dear, like a true little woman, and I love you better for all your sorrows and such a manner of bearing them.</p>
<p>The Letter that accompanies yours of tonight is from the unfortunate Mooncalf Dodds:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Dodds.</note> I do not read it till there be nothing else to occupy me. Why do you not open my Letters, if you even hope that they could by possibility entertain you? Nay perhaps you did open this, and find it no catch! Mrs Strachey&#x2019;s Letter is very light, and not so illegible as it looks: I will enclose it tonight.</p>
<p>It seems to me if Helen is to leave us at all, it ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> exactly to be when she fell into drunkenness: she would in that case refuse to go to Scotland, and perhaps fling herself over Battersea Bridge! If you find her continue troublesome at present, take steps with her at present. I am inclined to be pretty sure that I could really engage Margaret; and if you give me the commission I will at once try when I go back to Thornhill. She is a considerably superior woman to Helen, I think, in every or almost every way.</p>
<p>If John did fall in love with Jeannie,&#x2014;the first question that arises, is: Would Jeannie fall in love with him? If I were in her pumps, I think I should perhaps demur considerably there!&#x2014; Doubtless it would <pb id="pg-14-162" n="14:162"/>be the very saving of poor Jack if he could get wedded to any reasonable woman. I can see no other anchorage for him in the world. But do not let <hi rend="italic">us</hi> begin forestalling the stars! I consider it in the very highest degree unsafe to interfere with Nature at all in those cases.</p>
<p>Yesterday as you were aware, I set off for Gill; thence to Kinmont at 4 o&#x2019;clock, where Stewart, sole lord of the manor at present, and master of an apartment of his own at all times, was appointed to meet me. My Mother went to Gill in the gig with me: Jenny is a little better off; stays now in a part of the Austin house <hi rend="italic">at a rent</hi>. She is much to be lamented. I have set about employing her to make me some shirts; the stock I have are beginning ominously to <hi rend="italic">tear</hi>, since I left you.&#x2014; Stewart sat at one of the front windows of Kinmont waiting for me. It is a huge square-piled ashlar house, like a great pile of packing-boxes put together,&#x2014;Smirke the Architect<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Sir Robert Smirke (<sic><date when="1781-00-00">1781</date></sic><corr><date when="1780-00-00">1780</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25763"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), possibly his brother Sydney Smirke (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25764"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), English architects. The house cost &#xa3;40,000 to build.</note> has made nothing of it on the outside: but within it is really a noble house; the square packing-boxes turn out to be square stately spacious apartments with every kind of completeness. Stewart had a neat little dinnerkin waiting for me; he was the first civilized man or almost the first I had met since I quitted London. He told me a thing or two; but made me tell him a thousand times as many! The little dog set me talking on a great many subjects,&#x2014;and then observed that it was now <hi rend="italic">too late</hi> for driving to Scotsbrig, that he had admirable beds! I consented to stay; was lodged in the most sumptuous manner, slept six hours, and got off after breakfast; with <hi rend="italic">nerves,</hi>&#x2014;alas, with the feeling of a man that had got his pocket picked, for there had I <hi rend="italic">talked</hi> myself into such a state of head! I have had a shower-bath since my return; tomorrow I will take more vigorous measures than ever, and actually <hi rend="italic">have</hi> some reform worked on myself.</p>
<p>Have you any counsel to give about the shirts? Jean is to buy the stuff for them at Dumfries; but will not stir in it, till I hear whether you have anything to say.</p>
<p>My Mother asks me yesternight: &#x201C;Dost thou send Jane my poor regards now, when thou writes?&#x201D; I answer, &#x201C;Yes, when you bid me.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;But I always bid thee, then!&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Poor Scott: it is really excessively absurd.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had presumably mentioned something about A.

<p><salute>My dear Jeannie,&#x2014;</salute>Expect not tonight any due return to your nice long Letter which has just come. There came along with it a burble of a Letter from Hunter of Morton Mill, whom I half suspect of jockeyship&#x2014;whom, and whose negociations I find I must set off tomorrow and inspect with my own eyes. He &#x201C;advises me as a friend&#x201D; to give the grates &#x26;c still left in the house up to the Duke also;&#x2014;I will know whether it is not to some intrigue of Mr H&#x2019;s first that I am giving them up! I will go direct to the Factor,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Maxwell.</note> who has at least the advantage of being a gentleman, a man whose word means what it seems to mean. He and I, as I now believe, can end the business, or as good as end it; so that I may get home again, and be free of it!&#x2014; The only good news from Hunter is that the thing <hi rend="italic">can</hi> now be ended. God grant that!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Your Uncle&#x2019;s Letter comes also by this post: I enclose it here. Also I enclose the two wardrobe keys: you will have to take the drawers out before the things can so much as be conveniently carried up stairs. Alas, on Tuesday morning you will be all in a litter again, with many a sad thought too: but this, we may hope, will be the last time now.&#x2014; Open the wardrobe first: you will gradually find the other keys and items. The sideboard has its own keys in its drawers. The thing <hi rend="italic">last</hi> packed was the old Desk; which your Uncle says has already lost a foot.&#x2014; The remaining <hi rend="italic">plate</hi> is here in my trunk; six spoons, I think, of each kind; all in paper sealed. A fraction (2 inches square) of the green room window-cornice was discovered on the floor after M&#x2019;Caig had gone: this and a screw pin I bring with me. &#x201C;No packer&#x201D; is a terrible category!</p>
<p>All day I have gone about with ineffectual <hi rend="italic">castor</hi> in me! That will be an explanation of several things perhaps, at present. I have been up <pb id="pg-14-164" n="14:164"/>as far as Minscaw<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced.</note> (where <hi rend="italic">you</hi> never were) over the entirely silent sunshiny moors: I had to strip off all my flannels before setting out, and still after sunset go about in that way without feeling cold.&#x2014; I have been positively quite sickly and below par ever since I came hither: it is near two weeks now since I swallowed that green or black cup of copperas tea, the beginning of all my woes.</p>
<p>Dodds&#x2019;s Letter is not worth paying a new twopence for; accordingly I light pipes with it <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. Hamilton he says has treated him prince-like, for my sake;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had recommended Dodds to contact Sir William Hamilton; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410611-TC-JADO-01">TC to <sic>[JD]</sic><corr>JADO</corr>, <date when="1841-06-11">11 June 1841</date></ref>.</note> he Dodds loves me &#x26;c &#x26;c, and is sticking steadily to his tools as Law-Clerk: that is substantially all he says; and that to me was about worth the saying.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Perhaps you did right as to Helen; may it prosper with you: I will keep a hook however on Margaret. Our Doctor is indeed charming!&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest; in utter haste having two Letters still to write. I <hi rend="italic">super</hi>scribe myself here at the top<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., at the top of the first page.</note>&#x2014; Ever your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>I date still from Scotsbrig, not from Thornhill as I yesternight expected to have done. My sleep&#x2014;O that weary unmanageable sleep!&#x2014;again proved unprosperous: I made out but some three hours of it; and on awakening found myself in such a state of nerves as rendered Thornhill and complex irritating negociations a very questionable outlook. Having made no special engagement with any one, I put Jamie&#x2019;s gig-horse to potatoe-harrowing, and myself to a new <hi rend="italic">double</hi>-dose of drug stuff, and another day of somnolent Donothingism here. Tomorrow morning I can hope to be in much better case; tomorrow morning I must go at any rate. It is a most consolatory feeling to me, the hope that I shall then get <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. God send it: I am perfectly weary of Dukes and Dukery. Seldom before in this world was I so hemmed in with packthreads and cobwebs; reduced to a pause among obstacles that looked so entirely paltry. The Morton Miller<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunter.</note> I fancy to be a bit of <pb id="pg-14-165" n="14:165"/>a jockey withal; but we shall see. The whole of them are of a tribe which I am thankful to Heaven I have no kindred with. The sordid jannering <foreign><hi rend="italic">canaille</hi></foreign> [chattering rabble]!</p>
<p>Today I have looked over the Adamson Papers; a most <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> [sad] business, here and there: I have read some pages of an old <hi rend="italic">Josephus;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Flavius Josephus (<date when="0037-00-00">37</date>&#x2013;<date when="0100-00-00">100?</date>), Jewish historian and military leader, whose works include a <hi rend="italic">History of the Jewish War, Antiquities of the Jews</hi>, and his <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi>.</note> slept <hi rend="italic">four hours</hi>, more or less, amid all manner of noises, on the old sofa; dined on hen <hi rend="italic">soup:</hi> and now sunset having come, and no postboy (according to arrangement yesterday), I think I may as well walk over with this to Ecclefechan myself. It is the night correspondent to the London Sunday; so no Letters are to be expected, at least none that I care about.&#x2014; On Wednesday evening, if possible, at farthest on Thursday I hope to be back, and all these burbles cut or unravelled; in some reasonable way, <hi rend="italic">finished</hi>. After that, by some route or other: Homeward ho! I am in all ways totally grown an alien in this region now. It is pity; but it is <hi rend="italic">fate</hi>,&#x2014;how can I help it?</p>
<p>About this hour the two wardrobe keys (with much else!) will be whirling thro&#x2019; terrestrial space, perhaps somewhere about the Town of Stafford. I do hope they will get to you before the railway van arrives: indeed I think they will; but I ought to have made <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> by sending them the day before. You must take out all the wardrobe drawers: some of them are above a hundredweight, full of linen. Will you put the wardrobe in your room, or where? Up stairs where the green Bed is to be? I am glad of the poor old red chairs. O my poor little <foreign>Lassie</foreign>,&#x2014;and the poor <hi rend="italic">wee chair!</hi> It was like to make me weep as it stood yonder at Templand, and so much had come and gone since <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was occupied! But we must accept the evil of this world not along with the good only but as portion of the good: a world whose deepest basis is <hi rend="small-caps">Time</hi>, that is to say, is Death, Change and all manner of Sorrow. Joy, what we call joy, <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> continue here. God is Great!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Fuz never writes to me: I suppose his new &#x201C;business&#x201D; ought to be something relating to the <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> volume, which I look to see coming out now,&#x2014;with money in the tail of it. The Fraser Executors have dishonoured a small bill of &#xa3;8, which Emerson had accepted from <hi rend="italic">their</hi> Boston Bookseller instead of <hi rend="italic">money</hi> for me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420328-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1842-03-28">28 March</date></ref>.</note> To me it does no ill at all, tho&#x2019; perhaps the poor people expect that it would. I merely return it to the Boston Booksellers, and say: &#x201C;My cash, gentlemen!&#x201D; This I <pb id="pg-14-166" n="14:166"/>have already done.&#x2014; Fuz has made no answer about his Dickens copyright business either.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420326-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1842-03-26">26 March</date></ref>.</note> So much the better. He is, as you say, a considerable of a goose.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, if I can, I will send you another bit of empty writing: I hope to exchange all that soon for empty or pregnant <hi rend="italic">talking</hi>, and find my poor Jeannie not so ill as I sometimes fear! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Wife: all good be with thee.&#x2014; Ever affectionately</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name></p>

<salute>My dearest Helen</salute>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">kiss</hi> I gave to your letter and the little papercutter was a better acknowledgement than I can make for them now&#x2014;on paper&#x2014;truly they came just at the right moment&#x2014;to be a little consolation to me under the sorrowful thoughts which the sight of Jeannie&#x2019;s birthday gifts and letters gave rise to. How could I help being reminded of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> next birth-day&#x2014;should I live to see it&#x2014;when the letter full of blessings, and like my Uncles to Jeannie enclosing money&#x2014;which sure as the day came round, never failed to find me wherever I was, would for the first time be missing&#x2014; But all days of the year there will be something missing now!&#x2014;why dread that particular <hi rend="italic">one?</hi>&#x2014;once for all I have no Mother any more&#x2014;</p>
<p>Since nothing has been said to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Martin say nothing&#x2014;it is better so&#x2014;and for the locket&#x2014;do not return it to me&#x2014; I give it to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;it was <hi rend="italic">my</hi> gift to her and there is something very wretched in inheriting ones own gifts&#x2014; I must have them every one out of my sight&#x2014;</p>
<p>The dreadful box which has lingered so long&#x2014;thro my cowardice about meddling with any of her things&#x2014;has at length this evening got itself packed better or worse, and will be sent off to-morrow&#x2014; The things for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Martin, a plaster tea-pot &#x26;c are not addressed I believe&#x2014;but you will send them in proper order and the blue dress for Sophy<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Martin&#x2019;s da.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>There is a little parcel for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel and another for Margaret Hiddlestone&#x2014;these you must be kind enough to wrap up together and forward to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel as soon as convenient&#x2014; I have a broach to go to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I will send by post&#x2014;only these little things, which she must be familiar with the look of, I thought she might also like to have&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-167" n="14:167"/>Oh if I were done with all this sad work, tho after it there is to come&#x2014;nothing! The furniture will be arriving next&#x2014;and that my good little Jeannie cannot save me from&#x2014;cannot smuggle out of my way&#x2014; I have been in fear of it tonight&#x2014;tomorrow I suppose it will come&#x2014; I enclose a note for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Martin which you will give her along with the things when you receive them</p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>I think I mentioned last time we spoke that I wished and expected <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to see the woods<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Craigenputtoch.</note> left in what you considered good order every way, and among other things <hi rend="italic">all properly fenced</hi> against cattle,&#x2014;before you quitted them this season.</p>
<p>According to Mr Adamson&#x2019;s account it was <hi rend="italic">the Tenant</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Corson.</note> that was bound to keep up the fences, or repair them if down. But as it is very possible that he m<supplied>[ay o]</supplied>bject, and mak<supplied>[e]</supplied> delays, I hereby request <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to employ a proper stone-diker to make good all the fences of the woods, and to pay him out of your own funds; which will be accounted for to you again, when you present your ultimate account to Mr Adamson, whom I instruct about the matter today. It is also specially to be understood by everybody concerned that <hi rend="italic">no cattle</hi> of any description, belonging to whomsoever, are to <hi rend="italic">have any manner of access into any of the woods:</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had discovered that M&#x2019;Adam&#x2019;s cattle had been in the woods; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420322-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1842-03-22">22 March</date></ref>.</note> this I request you to bear particularly in mind.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And so, on the whole, expressing my hope and confidence that you will order everything in regard to this business, with judgement, with punctuality and fidelity, as you did last time, I remain,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Wife,&#x2014;</salute>We have just got up hither, Jamie and I, in the old Gig, and established ourselves in Glendinning&#x2019;s Inn. I was astir this morning at five o&#x2019;clock, and struggled to expedite everything; nevertheless it was towards nine before we got off; near three before we arrived here, over by Loch Etterick and Lockerbie: too late for calling on the Factor who has no power; wherefore I determined that we should wash our faces and have dinner first. Both those operations are done, and I have still half an hour before it seem time to make an <hi rend="italic">evening</hi> call on Maxwell; in this interval I set forward my epistle to you: if you hear nothing more it will at least apprise you that I am safe here, and bent upon finishing this very sorrowful business straight-way. It appears to me, if I now saw Maxwell the affair would not last long between us. We shall ascertain soon.</p>
<p>Poor Templand, solitary in the still sunshine! The look of it from the hilltops was one of the saddest I ever had. It is now I think some two-and-twenty years, since on a day of April not unlike this I first passed thro&#x2019; this village: I sat probably in this very room, then a dirty sanded country drinking-room, and rested myself over wretched coffee (I had walked from Muirkirk, and was bent for Dumfries); Edward Irving had parted from me the night before; of your name I had heard, but knew none of you:&#x2014;ah me, what things have come and have gone! It is all like a drama, and one scene of it has ended! Good Heavens&#x2014; But why do I dwell on such faces of the matter? I am not here to meditate or suffer, but to go and try to work a little.</p>
<p>Your face of Daniel Good<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The murderer; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420420-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-04-20">20 April</date></ref>.</note> (it was yours doubtless?) lay waiting at Ecclefechan as we passed this morning. An absurd stupid-looking blockhead of a figure; full of cunning, full of stolidity; the mouth puckered in intense yet foolish anxiety, the eyes watching askance what they will get nothing by watching: a thing ludicro-horrible. They will certainly hang him. As yet for a creature who could take the bowels of his wife and stuff them into a chaise-box, and act in all ways so like a hyena, I can conceive next to no pity. To be put <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of the world seems clearly what he demands of all people that would stay reasonably in it.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-169" n="14:169"/>The Glendinnings on our arrival, put us into the common room of Gigmen and Bagmen; but learning from the Hostler who we were, they swiftly ushered us into this private apartment, up stairs, which looks out upon the cross street, with a capital bedroom behind it. I will not go to the Russels&#x2019; till at least tea-time: we shall clearly do very well here.</p>
<p>If I see the Factor, it is possible I may stay till <hi rend="italic">after</hi> eight: in that case, Jamie will be trusted to put this Letter under way in due time; otherwise I will try to add a word after my return. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> for the present, dear Wife. Perhaps the Railway things have already arrived? I confidently expect news at Ecclefechan. <closer><salute>Good be with you, my two Jeannies.</salute></closer></p>
<name>T.C. (5 p.m.)</name>

<p><salute>My dear Mrs. Russell,&#x2014;</salute>I sit down to write to you at last! But how to put into written words what lies for you in my heart! If I were beside you, I feel as if I should throw myself on your neck, and cry myself to rest like a sick child. At this distance, to ask in cold writing all the heart-breaking things I would know of you, and to say all the kind things I would say for her and myself, is indeed quite impossible for me. You will come and see me, will you not, before very long? I can never go there again; but you will come to me? travelling is made so easy now! And I should feel such gratification in receiving into my own house one who was ever so dearly welcome in hers, and who, of all who loved her, was, by one sad chance and another, the only one whose love was any help to her when she most needed our love! She blessed you for the comfort you gave her, and you shall be blessed for it here and hereafter. The dying blessing of such a pure fervent heart as hers cannot have been pronounced on you in vain; and take my <pb id="pg-14-170" n="14:170"/>blessing also, &#x2018;kind sweet&#x2019; woman! a less holy one, but not less sincerely given.</p>
<p>Will you wear the little thing I inclose in remembrance of me, and of this time? You will also receive, through my cousin in Liverpool, a little box, and scarf, of hers, which I am sure you will like to have; and along with these will be sent to your care a shawl for Margaret Hiddlestone, who is another that I shall think of with grateful affection, as long as I live, for the comfort which she bestowed on her during the last weeks. I think Dr. Russell has some of her books; I desired that he should have them. He has given me an inestimable gift in that letter; for which I deeply thank him, and for so much else. Remember me to your father.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. Edward Dobbie.</note> I sent him the poor old <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi> last week; I know he used to get it from her. Will you write two or three lines to my aunt Ann<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Welsh.</note>&#x2014;you sometimes write to her, I believe&#x2014;and say to her that, although returned to London, and a good deal better in health, I am still incapable of much exertion of any sort, and have not yet set about answering my letters? She sent me a long sermon, to which she has, no doubt, looked for some reply; it was well meant, and I would not offend her, but I am not up to correspondences of that sort just now.</p>
<p>All good be with you all. Think of me, and pray for me; I have much need of more help than lies in myself, to bear up against the stroke that has fallen on me.</p>

I parted with everybody in good friendship; owe no man any kind of thing, or shadow of a thing; have done what did in regard to other matters seem the best and wisest in my power, and the question at issue now being merely an affairs of pounds, I value it comparatively little.</p>
<p>But enough, enough: I shall find some Letter from you at Ecclefechan, and write you far more at leisure tomorrow,&#x2014;with my hands <hi rend="italic">not</hi> numb, my eyes (and my heart) <hi rend="italic">not</hi> full of dust!</p>

<salute>My dear Wife,</salute>
<p>Your long Letter of Sunday night, one of the best that could be written, which you wrote when &#x201C;too useless for anything else,&#x201D; had arrived in Ecclefechan yesterday morning, and lay ready there with the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, as Jamie and I, weary dusty, cold and belated, passed hastily thro&#x2019; the village. We did not get away from Dumfries &#x201C;in an hour&#x201D;; it was very nearly three hours before with my utmost diligence I could get thro&#x2019; my small affairs there.&#x2014; By the way, I find your last two Letters have both been posted <hi rend="italic">too late</hi> in the day: Good&#x2019;s physiognomy<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420426-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-04-26">25 [26] April</date></ref>.</note> did not leave London till Monday morning; neither had your last letter left it till Tuesday morning. In the last Letter too I discover, not without astonishment, an old letter of my own enclosed! What does that foreshadow? That you filled up your cover <hi rend="italic">in haste</hi> not knowing well what you stuffed into it? Or perhaps that the railway things had already arrived, and you were too busy to announce it,&#x2014;for this letter of mine is the one written on the Templand packing day! It is very myst<hi rend="italic">erous</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably imitating Helen Mitchell&#x2019;s pronunciation.</note></p>
<p>Gambardella, if he will actually shoot cocks for one, ought to be encouraged as one of the usefullest of men. He will lend one his gun at any rate, I suppose. I have an idea that there is talent in him; but he riots and rattles at a fearful rate,&#x2014;and perhaps his very talents, his very virtues, are somewhat those of a &#x201C;Pan&#x2019;s Satyr&#x201D;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411119-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1841-11-19">19 Nov. 1841</date></ref>, where TC described Gambardella&#x2019;s face as &#x201C;the very image of the classic God Pan&#x2019;s.&#x201D; Gambardella&#x2019;s shooting of the cocks whose crowing disturbed JWC&#x2019;s sleep was evidently prevented by a thunderstorm.</note> It was a pity, <pb id="pg-14-172" n="14:172"/>however, for that thunder-shower. The electric virtue must have been spread over all the British air: the evening before, they had thunder and rain at Carlisle, at Sanquhar &#x26;c; and that very day while roving over the Scotsbrig moor I heard thunder in the distance,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; here all continues thunderless, rainless, blistered, hard and burnt.</p>
<p>Tonight if your post go aright, I may ascertain whether the Railway things did arrive on Tuesday; at all events, whether you got the two keys. That will be a sad litter again, sorrowful outwardly, sorrowful within! But that too will have to pass, and we shall leave it behind us. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Allons</hi></foreign> [Forward]!</p>
<p>If I promised you long details of my late pilgrimage, I must break my word, at least keep it on another day: at present I am literally incapable of writing. The want of sleep is rising to a kind of real misery for me. My eyes are swoln with yesterday&#x2019;s wind and dust: I have managed to sleep two hours in the daytime, and at present (before tea) am as stupid as an owl.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I wait for some <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> or other Steamboat Document to begin fixing on my day of return. That perhaps is the best &#x201C;detail&#x201D; I can give you! I will throw down the pen till after tea.&#x2014; (<hi rend="italic">after tea</hi>)&#x2014; Little Jane<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s da.</note> has come with your <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> small Note of Wednesday; I am very sorry for thee, my poor Wifie! The first brunt of it will be over <hi rend="italic">now</hi>; I shall wait for tomorrow&#x2019;s letter with still more anxiety.</p>
<p>You did well to write to all these parties. I think Mrs Russell is actually one of the best-conditioned softest-hearted women I have seen: it is and continues one&#x2019;s chief consolation that she remained near and ever accessible, affectionate and helpful in those last times. She was knocking at the outer door of Templand just at the moment when that stroke, which proved of Death, had struck within! She ran, she struggled and busied herself, as the kindest sister, the kindest daughter or mother could have done. I like her and her good old Father extremely well. Dr Russell too behaved all along, especially towards the end, like a friend and a man of sense and true courteous humanity to me. They were all about crying (except the Doctor I think all <hi rend="italic">were</hi> crying) yesterday, when Jamie and I came away.&#x2014; I called for Marg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Hiddlestone; found her ironing clothes in a small clean upper-room: poor body, she had bought a gill of whisky to mix among water for me, and as I, not apprised at the moment, preferred simple water, she got Jamie up afterwards, and made him drink. I gave her two half sovereigns wrapt in paper to buy frocks for her two girls; at which she seemed heartily delighted,&#x2014;and not in an avaricious manner; for I think her very affectionate, poor Margaret. I also searched out poor old Mary Mills; <pb id="pg-14-173" n="14:173"/>found her scraping potatoes in a strange witch-like apartment, full of dirt, piled fuel-wood, with old bedimmed penny-pictures and strange <foreign>etceteras</foreign> hung over the walls. She had begun to draw her pension: I charged Mrs Russell, if anything befel the poor old creature, to let us know.</p>
<p>That night I called upon the Factor Maxwell, I consented, after finishing our business, to step in with him to the other room (for it was evening) and &#x201C;drink a glass of wine with us.&#x201D; The &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">us</hi>&#x201D; were Major Creighton<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Crichton.</note> and he. The Major looks precisely what he did when we saw him last; fresh and brisk as ever: but he has now no memory at all I think, no mind at all; he begins to speak, and ends in a murmur without uttering any word: Maxwell made him punch that night, and he drank it in silence.&#x2014; Farewell to all that!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The light has left me, my poor little lassie, and I must leave thee. Tomorrow I shall certainly be better; I have taken a shower-bath &#x26;c; I do expect to sleep. On Monday you shall have better news of me,&#x2014;and, the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> having now arrived, of the date I am thinking of for coming!</p>
<p><closer><salute>Love to Cousin Jeannie; my Mothers love to you. And so, Good Night, dearest!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Wife,&#x2014;</salute>I must write you a word again tonight, since yesterday was your blank day: a word will suffice, while there is nothing to be recorded, and as yet nothing to be predicted, not even the day of my arrival home.</p>
<p>I am heartily glad those packages have got under our roof, in whatever state: such dreary waiting, in such a mood, too natural in the case, must have driven you almost to despair. The Carriage dues, which include the freight to Liverpool also, and all but the cartage to Dumfries and the packing, are no doubt the just charges, and we will not quarrel with them in the least. Let us be thankful only that the sorrowful business <foreign><hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi></foreign> [one way or the other] is over, and no more agitations on that score are to be apprehended for you. As for the house at Chelsea, if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> like it, do not regard much my dislike of <pb id="pg-14-174" n="14:174"/>it: I cannot be healthy anywhere under the sun; I am a perceptible degree unhealthier in London than elsewhere; but London I do feel withal is the only spot in the earth where I can enjoy something like the blessedness of freedom, and this I ought to be willing to purchase at the expense of dirty smoke, tumult and annoyance of various kinds. It strikes me that I must run into the country when the town gets insupportable to me; but I ought not to quit hold of Town. To live in &#x201C;cloth-worship&#x201D; of his Grace of Buccleuch, for example,&#x2014;I confess I should hesitate between Monmouth Street<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where old clothes were sold in London; cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 241&#x2013;42.</note> and that! Not that, I should say; anything rather than that!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesternight I wrote to Harriet about the Execution of Louis: I also excused you for not writing, and gave some composing account of your situation and my own. The inclosed foolish Autograph-petition I also answered, with inconceivable brevity.</p>
<p>Today I have had word from Annan about Steamers: the first is on Wednesday <hi rend="italic">at six in the morning</hi>. The second is&#x2014;not yet fixed! I shall have small satisfaction out of these Steamers, I think! I shall have to rally myself, however, and make my way homeward by some means or other. If you answer this Note, I shall still be here for it; but do not unless I request you write after Monday morning,&#x2014;after Monday Evening, I mean.</p>
<p>Jeannie&#x2019;s Letter,&#x2014;you must first thank her for writing at all, and then say that she <hi rend="italic">was</hi> too late for the post; that consequently she reached Ecclefechan this morning, and me this evening along with your Letter of last night! The missing of posts appears to be a very frequent thing.</p>
<p>Today I have lain on a sofa, and read the whole &#x201C;History of the Family of Carlyle.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nicholas Carlisle, <hi rend="italic">Collections for a History of the Ancient Family of Carlisle</hi> (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>).</note> Positively not so bad reading. I discover there what illustrious genealogies we have; a whole regiment of <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi> Carlyles: wide possessions all over Annandale, Cumberland, Durham; gone all now into the utterest wreck; absorbed into Douglasdoms, Drumlanrigdoms, and the Devil knows what! Two of us have written plays; one could carve organs, sculpture horses. Mrs Jameson&#x2019;s old Carlyle was cousin of Bridekirk:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were Carlyles of Bridekirk, parish of Annan (Nicholas Carlisle 169&#x2013;91).</note>&#x2014;I suppose I too must have been meant for a Duke, but the means were dropt in the passage. Heigho!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; What a hideous affair is that of poor Macgregor.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Walter Macgregor, a cousin of the Welsh family in Liverpool; otherwise unidentified. In a comment submitted to the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi> Feedback Page on <date when="2008-05-16">16 May 2008</date>, Janella Horne posits that TC is referring to a relative of Walter MacGregor&#x2019;s, Alexander MacGregor (1806&#x2013;42), physician, whose suicide by cutting his leg and jugular veins with a razor on <date when="1842-04-26">26 April</date> was reported in <hi rend="italic">The Liverpool Mail</hi> and elsewhere, including the London newspaper <hi rend="italic">John Bull</hi> (<date when="1842-04-30">30 April</date>): 207.</note> Folly&#x2019;s steps lead <pb id="pg-14-175" n="14:175"/><hi rend="italic">not</hi> to blessedness, lead down to Bedlam and Death.

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>I am very <foreign>wae</foreign> for you, battling away there with so many sorrowful confusions, and a miserable headache to aggravate all! You will be at it again tomorrow morning; you will fight along, and it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> end itself.</p>
<p>Those drawers you speak of <hi rend="italic">were</hi> my doing, poor Wull Fingland fetching and carrying for me. I wish you could tell me the glass and crockery were all safe! M&#x2019;Caig had sole charge of that, after Helen and Mrs Martin; and with the wardrobe, which also was all his and his man&#x2019;s, he seems to have prospered ill. The drawers of the old Desk are not locked; pull, and they will come out: there was no key, and had been none, for anything but the top-leaf or lid. So far as I recollect there was little in those drawers, except somewhere the new stair-carpet. You will find all things, as I predicted, in a terrible huddle, one portion here another there: I never in my life saw such a tumult. M&#x2019;Caig knows little seemingly even about his own branch of packing, nothing at all about any other; and is a languid helpless kind of man.&#x2014; Of Bibles there were two, beside the little one that has come to you: an old quarto Caplegill<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Home of JWC&#x2019;s maternal grandparents.</note> Bible which I gave your Uncle; a larger finer quarto that had been given by Mr Bradfute<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Bradfute.</note> (this is the one I think you mean); this too went to Liverpool,&#x2014;a line of writing in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> hand assigned it to Cousin Jeannie. No other Bible came to light: none was sold, or otherwise sent irrevocably from us.&#x2014; I hope to hear on Tuesday evening that you have got fairly thro&#x2019; the business, better or worse.</p>
<p>A Steamer does sail from Annan on Wednesday morning at 6 o&#x2019;clock, a most untowardly hour for me. By this nevertheless I mean to go. On Wednesday evening, at latest on Thursday morning, a Letter may find me in Maryland Street. I think of writing to warn them. Perhaps I may go round by Manchester, and see Geraldine, Ker, Ballantyne and Prentice;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps Stewart Ker; Thomas Ballantyne and Archibald Prentice.</note> I even think of writing tomorrow to Rugby to tell Arnold that I pass his place and could stay a night with him, and speak <pb id="pg-14-176" n="14:176"/>radicalism, and see the Field of Naseby Fight:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Thomas Arnold. Naseby, 12 mi. E by N of Rugby where, <date when="1645-06-14">14 June 1645</date>, the parliamentary forces under Fairfax and Cromwell decisively defeated the royalist forces under Charles I and Prince Rupert, ending all chance of success for the royalists.</note> so adventurous am I! For I really do want to get the dust blown out of me a little, and speak a few civilized words before appearing in the Metropolis again! We shall see in what mood we are; I am insomnolent still, and a fair distance off the average state. But my utter Donothingism in these days does begin to press heavy on my conscience; I should regard active speaking even as a favourable change. Alas, I have this evening been up to take leave of poor old Grahame; a man of much worth to me always, but whose speech is of cattle!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ecclus. 38:25.</note> I have not even read since I came hither; I feel as if the mind of me were a poor scraggy bog upon which there had been cast ashes and the sweepings of highways: any remnants of grass that there are get doubly and trebly impatient to be up again, above ground, in the character of real grass, were it only bog grass. Patience,&#x2014;and still more Diligence along with that! We shall see what comes of it all.</p>
<p>Alick and Jenny are here tonight; waiting in the other end of the house (my Mother&#x2019;s end) till this be done. I have also to write to Annan for a more precise account of the Steamer&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">hour</hi>. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Wife.

<salute>Dear Miss Jewsbury,</salute>
<p>My sorrowful affairs here are only just ended. About the middle of this week I pass thro&#x2019; Lancashire on my way homewards.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was writing on Mon.</note> If I knew your exact place, I would make an effort to see you,&#x2014;and succeed in it, unless the journey had, as journies are too apt always to do, already driven me into a state of despair. On Thursday morning a Letter will find me at 20. Maryland Street, Liverpool. There are railway trains, I think, often in the day to Manchester; and Manchester as a starting-point for London is about equivalent to Liverpool. Let us see! &#x201C;Hell is paved with good resolutions,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> is it not?&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-177" n="14:177"/>My poor Wife I imagine does not write even to you; writes to nobody, but short notes to me. She is growing calmer, but still seems very weakly, sick and disconsolate. Her cheery young Cousin is still with her.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Wife,&#x2014;</salute>A single word here (with benumbed hands) to keep you from alarming yourself. I have been down at Gill with my Mother; we went under a broiling glare of sunshine; I fell asleep there, after dinner, and it is now past 9 o&#x2019;clock and a bitter night of frost.

<p><salute>My dear Wife,&#x2014;</salute>This is likely to be the last Note I write to you from Scotsbrig on the present occasion. Being now to set about packing, and having it in view to put this poor little black Desk into the bottom of my Trunk, I finish writing to you before I begin anything else. Nothing new is to be communicated; your expected Letter has not yet arrived; the day has passed over till this hour (4 o&#x2019;clock) absolutely without recordable incident. I have been twice upon the moor (since six, when I awoke); I have seen poor cattle straying over their barren bogs, poor <pb id="pg-14-178" n="14:178"/>ploughmen toiling in the red furrow, their ploughshares gleaming in the sun,&#x2014;a most innocuous flash: they and their huts and their whole existence looking sad almost pathetic to me. They are very poor in purse; poor in purpose, principle, for most part, in all that makes the wealth of a man. Poor devils! The Farmer of Stennybeck, the next place to this, has a Mother stone-blind, whom I remember out of infancy as a brisk buxom <foreign>lass</foreign> that sat in the Kirk with me: utter poverty, financiering equal to a Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2019;s, has attended them these many years, ever in the near background a jail; and now yesterday the poor blind woman, searching down some heavy churn from the garret (for she works and bustles all over the house), tumbled thro&#x2019; a trap-door and nearly killed herself: unfortunate souls! The man asked Jamie one day, &#x201C;What d&#x2019;ye think <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come of me?&#x201D; Peel&#x2019;s tariff has taken some twenty-pounds worth from him. And Hoggan his <foreign>Laird</foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly George M. Hoggan, Waterside House, or Edward Hoggan, Bellevue, both of Thornhill.</note> is rioting thro&#x2019; the world like a broken blackguard;&#x2014;I am <foreign>wae</foreign> to look on poor old Annandale, poor old England. The Devil is busy with us all!</p>
<p>My visits to Manchester and Rugby look extremely questionable <hi rend="italic">today:</hi> but I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> &#x201C;be at Liverpool on Thursday morning,&#x201D; and that was all <hi rend="italic">I engaged for!</hi> We shall see how it turns <hi rend="italic">then</hi>. What a pity a man cannot sleep, and so live something like other men! For the rest, it is no secret to me that he ought still to keep a bridle on himself, and not let insomnolence nor any other perversity drive him beyond limits. Perhaps it will do me good to go to those places. If I find it look so when the facts come before me, I will <hi rend="italic">make</hi> myself go. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Allons</hi></foreign> [Let us go]. About the end of the week I may hope to be home beside you, rallying at Chelsea, to see whether Richard cannot be himself again<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Colley Cibber&#x2019;s version of <hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi> (<date when="1700-00-00">1700</date>) 5.3.</note></p>
<p>Yesterday I got my hair cropt; partly by my own endeavour (in the front part), chiefly by Sister Jenny&#x2019;s in the rear: I fear you will think it rather an original cut; but in this hot weather the growth of the hair is very rapid. I have also been, for the last time, today in the showerbath; and omitting, this time, the bathing-cap, in honour of my new hair, it was pretty pungent. The sense of clean-skin is always wholesome for me. Isabella and her maids are washing the last vestiges of soiled linen or handkerchiefs, that I may start fair. She is very sickly, poor Isabella, haunted with the thought that she is to die soon: instinctively a most delicate, courteous kind of character;&#x2014;and makes very tolerable coffee now!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Tomorrow evening about this time, if all prosper, I shall probably <pb id="pg-14-179" n="14:179"/>be near Liverpool; I think I may hope to take tea with them in Maryland Street. Will there be a Letter from you on the morrow morning?&#x2014; I wish I heard that the headache was away; that the mournful hurly-burly were getting hushed about you again. What a two months these have been!</p>
<p>All has grown dim here this afternoon, the Sun veiled, wind suddenly turned to west; as if after long praying and lamenting the thirsty husbandmen were about to get rain,&#x2014;precisely at the wrong moment for me! For the sake of many thirsty creatures, biped, quadruped, animal and vegetable I will not regret; but I could have liked it better <hi rend="italic">next</hi> week, if all the same to you.&#x2014; What came of the china? For you are into that now. I will quit the pen, empty <hi rend="italic">this</hi> inkglass, and leave space for a word when once the post-boy (Sandy&#x2019;s Tom) shall have come. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>.&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">7. o&#x2019;clock</hi>. Tom is come; your Letter of <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> night here <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. The Steamer to sail, Nelson again writes, at 20 minutes <hi rend="italic">before</hi> seven. The Packing still all to do.&#x2014; Poor Spedding, he also has lost his good Mother;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah, b. Gibson (<date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), d. <date when="1842-04-24">24 April</date>.</note> a very amiable old lady, as she seemed to me: the poor old husband is perhaps still more to be pitied. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>: wish me a good journey and voyage.

<p><salute>My dear Wifie,&#x2014;</salute>I am got here to Manchester, and am successfully executing my first call,&#x2014;on Geraldine namely, who charges me to send her best love to you, who &#x201C;would have written sooner had it not been for a miserable influenza which she still has.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury wrote several letters in the period after the death of JWC&#x2019;s mother: &#x201C;I love you more than anything else I have in the world, and what must I do if you are to go on suffering in this way?&#x201D; (Ireland 58, where dated <date when="1842-05-00">May</date>). She also reported: &#x201C;I am hard at work on the said tale I told you of, and when you are well enough I should like you to see what is done, for you have been the imaginary &#x2018;chair&#x2019; I have addressed myself to&#x201D; (Ireland 59).

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here in this quiet room, before going to bed, I will write you a small short word, to say that I am got safe so far, and all well, within 70 miles (or 4 hours railwaying) of home, where I hope to be before tomorrow this time. I did send you a newspaper from Liverpool, which I hope you have already received; but an express assurance in words will also be welcome; and if I were to put it off till tomorrow, you could not receive it till Tuesday morning at soonest.</p>
<p>I feel very strange to be here: I came off the railway at 5 o&#x2019;clock this afternoon; the people<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Arnold and his wife Mary, b. Penrose (d. <date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>).</note> welcomed me in the kindliest manner, and I am very glad that I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yield to the strong slavish desire I had to baulk my kind hosts, and rush right onwards! I am in a large sumptuous room, as quiet as sleep itself; very far from a certain little upper room in Scotsbrig, where perhaps I could like better to be;&#x2014;but we must not complain, dear Mother; it is one of the choicest blessings of Heaven to me that I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> meet you so often, that you are still spared to me, as a kind Mother, under this sun. Blessings be upon your little upstairs household yonder! The same kind Providence watches over us there as here; and is not wearied in sending us many mercies.</p>
<p>We got into Liverpool by our Steamer very successfully about seven O&#x2019;clock; the good Welshes all welcomed me &#x201C;in their choicest mood.&#x201D; <pb id="pg-14-181" n="14:181"/>Next day (yesterday) I went over to Manchester; saw the people I was in quest of there; but preferred <hi rend="italic">returning</hi> to Liverpool at night, in order not to change my bed. This morning at half past ten, I got off; I was not in very high order at setting out, but I grew better by sitting quiet in the railway carriage; I feel considerably better at present, and look forward to a more comfortable sleep than any of the last three nights have yielded. Tomorrow they will carry me to see the field of Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s great Battle at Naseby, and then put me into the railway for London in good time. I again feel very glad that I <hi rend="italic">kept</hi> my purpose, and did not fly away like a fool as I was minded!</p>
<p>Poor Manchester looked far too <hi rend="italic">clear;</hi> there was not the third part of the smoke that is usual there; the mills being, so many of them, out of work. Numbers of idle people were visible in the streets. I understand Birmingham is no better: it is a dreary time.&#x2014; There came two Newspapers from Chelsea (no Letter); these I sent on this morning to Dumfries.</p>
<p>I hope Jenny is with you tonight; she will be useful at this time particularly. Jamie will have got rain to his fields too now: we had a good heavy rain at Manchester</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Inclosed is one of Chamber&#x2019;s Circulars on the case of Burn&#x2019;s poor destitute Sister. The thing speaks for itself; and indeed spoke, as I could see, to you with proper effect. If according to your prompt generous purpose you can get some arrangement set on foot in Manchester, a sum doubtless might be collected there. Another charitable hand (Mr Welsh of Maryland Street, my Wife&#x2019;s Uncle) is to start the matter in Liverpool: I in this circle of mine will do what is in my power. Hands to the work!&#x2014; As Chambers alone knows the details of this business, and your knowledge, when once you have read the Circular, and heard that I gave Chambers instant &#x201C;leave to use my <hi rend="italic">name</hi>,&#x201D; will be precisely equal to my own knowledge, he I suppose is the person to be corresponded with about it. Perhaps you are already acquainted with the man? I will apprise him today that you have consented to act;&#x2014;that he had better send you a dozen other Circulars, for one thing: I myself have got but three in all; and a second of them is travelling, side by side with this, on the way to Liverpool.</p>
<p>I regretted that I saw so little of you in Manchester; but hope another time when I am there or when you are here, we shall be luckier.</p>

<salute>My dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>Your melancholy tidings<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About the death of Sarah Spedding, his mother.</note> found me still in Scotland preparing just to quit it. I looked from the Firth into your Skiddaw mountains, and thought of Bassenthwaite still Church-yard and the new-made Grave. <pb id="pg-14-183" n="14:183"/>Alas, it is the law of man&#x2019;s existence here below; the sacredest ties, of Mother and Child, are appointed from of old to be cut asunder; the parent has to die and the son to be left living: it was the will of Nature from the first. Beneficent too;&#x2014;yes, kind, tho&#x2019; rigorous and stern; as the Great God, whose work we are, everywhere is.</p>
<p>Your Brother has a small cheery Note lying here for me, announcing in quizzical enigmatic style his safe arrival:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the U.S. where he was serving as sec. to the Ashburton commission; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420213-TC-TSS-01">TC to TSS, <date when="1842-02-13">13 Feb.</date></ref></note> the smile dies mournfully away in reading him; poor fellow, for him too a sharp pang is in store. Ah me, why did Death come into the world?&#x2014; Say rather, why was it a world <hi rend="italic">at all!</hi> We have no business to ask such questions. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> thou mild maternal Figure, entered now upon Eternity; we too shall soon be there!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I staid two nights in Lancashire; on the morrow after my arrival in Liverpool, I went over to Manchester and returned. The most tragic circumstance I noted there was the <hi rend="italic">want of smoke</hi>;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Because factories were closed; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420506-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, [<date when="1842-05-06">6 May</date>]</ref>.</note> Manchester was never in my time third-part as clear. What a strange country we are at this hour! Two thousand men and women assembled the other Saturday night before the Provost&#x2019;s door in Paisley, and stood, without tumult, indeed almost in silence: when questioned as to their purposes, they said they had no money, no food nor fuel, they were Fathers and Mothers, working men and women, and had come out there to see whether they could not be saved alive. The police withdrew to a distance, there were soldiers hard by to have checked any riot.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I arrived here on Saturday Night, late; tolerably well myself, and found all as well as I could reasonably hope. I am collecting myself during this week; having need of that withal. Not for a long while have my whole activities been so completely knocked on the head, and all things reduced to still-stand with me as by these late weeks and their history.</p>
<p>You would get a Newspaper that I sent from Liverpool? It was <pb id="pg-14-185" n="14:185"/>Wednesday morning at five o&#x2019;clock when Jamie drove me off from Scotsbrig. We left our poor Mother, very sorrowful to quit me; a <foreign>wae</foreign> parting as usual: but Jenny was appointed to come over on the Friday; I hope before this time they are getting into their usual course again. My Mother seemed to me generally in better health than the average while I was there. It is ever among my chief blessings to see her face again when I come back to my birthland. My good old Mother!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I waited two nights in Liverpool; during the one day I went out to Manchester to see some people, and returned. Manchester was dreadfully <hi rend="italic">clear of smoke</hi>; no mills going, except on fractions of &#x201C;short time&#x201D;; many hearths made cold in consequence. There never was, I believe, such a stern universal period of distress in England as even now. On the Friday morning Mr Welsh, good man, attended me to the railway: I had got some cold, and missed getting sufficient sleep; however, I recovered during the day by simply sitting still and silent. I had, from Scotsbrig, appointed beforehand to pause about 70 miles on your side of London, and pay a visit to a certain Oxford dignitary of distinction, one Dr Arnold Master of Rugby Free-School: I would have willingly paid five pounds all day to be honourably off; but it clearly revealed itself to me, <hi rend="italic">Thou shouldst veritably go;</hi> so at Birmingham I booked myself in the right way and went. Right well that I did so; for the contrary would have looked like the work of a fool; and the people all at Rugby were of especial kindness to me, and I was really glad to have made their acquaintance. Next day they drove me over, some fifteen miles off, to see the field of Naseby Fight, Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s chief battle, or one of his chief. It was a grand scene for me. Naseby a venerable Hamlet, larger than Middlebie, all built of mud, but trim, with high peaked roofs and two feet thick of smooth thatch on them, and plenty of trees scattered round and among; it is built as on the brow of the Hagheads at Ecclefechan; Cromwell lay with his back to that, and King Charles was drawn up as at Wull Welsh&#x2019;s (only the Sinclair Burn must be mostly dried, and the hollow much wider and deeper): they flew at one another, and Cromwell ultimately &#x201C;<foreign>brashed</foreign> [broke] <hi rend="italic">him</hi> all to <foreign>roons</foreign> [pieces].&#x201D; I plucked two gowans and a cowslip from the burial heaps of the slain, which still stand as heaps, but sunk away in the middle. Honour to Oliver! At seven o&#x2019;clock they had me home again, dinnered and off in the last railway train. About eleven I got to London, and in another hour a Cabman (in spite of his proving to be <hi rend="italic">drunk</hi>) set me down safe at this door.</p>
<p>Jane is much thinner and paler than I ever<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NLS 1763.215 ends here.</note> saw her before. But she <pb id="pg-14-186" n="14:186"/>is said to be better far than she once was, and I hope will go fast on recovering now. The summer has now got a copious wetting of rain, and will henceforth come out greener and greener; to the profit of us all. The Cousin Jeannie, a most cheery young figure, has been and is of great use here.&#x2014; Jack came down to dine with us on Sunday, looking as brisk as ever. He was, as usual, in a mighty <foreign><hi rend="italic">flaff</hi></foreign> [flutter]; put many questions about the whole of you, and hurried off sometimes with half an answer. He talked of going to Cambridge for two days this week: but they are stationary at London for the Summer, as I understand.</p>
<p>Let me take to business, however, before the sheet <hi rend="italic">again</hi> go! I had to bid you buy me, with your choicest skill, cloth for six shirts, and send it on to Jenny. They are not to have collars; the breasts are to be of the best procurable linen: Jane was at first of opinion even that the whole bodies should be of <hi rend="italic">linen</hi> of a coarser sort; for she alleges that not only does the calico wear wonderfully fast, but, our maid being an indifferent washer, it likewise grows mournfully yellow! However, this morning, as her ultimate vote, she seems to sway again towards eminently good calico;&#x2014;or perhaps it will be best for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to judge on the spot by the capabilities of your shops, and by your own experimental knowledge of the relative values of linen and calico. Six shirts: do your best, and Jenny will do hers.</p>
<p>And so enough today, dear Sister. If you send this forward immediately to Scotsbrig, it will do no harm, tho&#x2019; I mean to write thither before long.&#x2014; James will send me tidings when he pays the Dunscore architect;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For work at Craigenputtoch by a Dunscore builder.</note> you when you have got Jenny set to work. My special respects to the Pipe-buyer. <closer><salute>Good be among you all!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your friendly message reached me far away in the North; whither a sad event, the unexpected death of my good Mother-in-law, had called me; and where the consequences of that have detained me, in dreary &#x201C;final settlements&#x201D; &#x26;c, till a few days ago. I have passed two months among the mountains, in a most slow-moving series of the lowest prosaic businesses, and such stern <hi rend="italic">poetry</hi> as my own solitary thoughts and the spring storms and sunbursts could yield there, in a mood like that. &#x201C;One generation passeth away and another cometh; but the Earth abideth forever,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccles. 1:4.</note>&#x2014;at least for a much longer time! Perhaps these mournful months, seemingly all empty and silent, have not been without their uses to me.</p>
<p>Unless the Summer grow absolutely too hot for endurance here, I feel now as if I must try to continue in London. &#x201C;Not in thy condition but in thyself lies the mean impediment&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Julius Caesar</hi> 1.2.</note>&#x2014;how true always! True whether the impediment be want of health, want of money, or whatever want; for always at bottom one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">want</hi> is and continues a want of <hi rend="italic">wisdom</hi>, of discernment to see and fidelity to do; there is on the whole no other <hi rend="italic">want</hi> at all!&#x2014; Summer solitudes and sea breezes would indeed be grateful to me, but even these would not bring healing; nay the true healing itself (getting heartily to work, namely) is of the nature of a new disease! So we name it, in our cowardice of heart. We are born to <pb id="pg-14-188" n="14:188"/><hi rend="italic">toil;</hi> and this in our poltroonery, finding it not joyous but grievous, we name &#x201C;misery&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c.</p>
<p>Meanwhile if I do run into the country, Glamorganshire and your kind neighbourhood appears now among the likeliest places. My poor Wife, who has suffered greatly in these sad weeks, is still very feeble; she cannot for the present think of Scotland, and may perhaps prove a new impulse westward before the Sun depart again. We shall see.</p>
<p>You, if you come to London, are specially requested not to omit calling here. We strive to keep ourselves in the utmost possible seclusion: but this door ought always to be open to a true-hearted man with an errand like yours.</p>
<p>We are glad always to learn of your well-being&#x2014;of your well-doing. <closer><salute>We send you many kind thanks and wishes. And so: Forward, forward.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have been very idle all this morning; called off by one thing after another, and alas by my own <hi rend="italic">laziness</hi> most of all: I will not throw-by the pen till I have accomplished at least one small good-action, the writing of a few words to my Mother! You have heard nothing of me since I wrote to you from Rugby: Jack in<supplied>[d]</supplied>eed told me he wrote last week, and you have had Newspapers indicating that nothing material was wrong: nevertheless a Letter I know is always a Letter for you. Perhaps Jean too did forward a Letter I wrote to Dumfries? I rather encouraged her to do so.</p>
<p>On the day after my last Letter, having actually visited Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s battle-ground &#x26;c, I did arrive safe here towards midnight. All was correct in the house; myself still partly expected there: poor Jane was worn away far thinner than I had expected, than I ever saw her before. She continues still very weakly, very mournful; but, I trust, is gathering strength nevertheless. Some days she looks much better; then she relapses again. She gets out daily for most part, but is a very poor walker at present. She keeps herself very silent; does not seem to incline speaking much even with me about her Mother. Poor thing, she has got a deep wound, which only Time can heal somewhat. Her Liverpool Cousin, a cheery little creature, is very useful here at present.</p>
<p>Not the smallest news has yet come about Templand Farm: one is at least not disturbed with clatter about it here. A Letter came this morning, inclosed in a few lines from Alick, the first word I have yet got out of Annandale,&#x2014;for which thank him in my name. The Letter itself is a very useless one; a man talking of engaging the House at Craigenputtoch as a &#x201C;genteel residence,&#x201D; with the adjuncts of hunting and fishing. He evidently does not know the ground, except by some transitory clatter of M&#x2019;Diarmid&#x2019;s:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M&#x2019;Diarmid.</note> I have written to say that Corson has the place for this year; and that in no year do I think it would fit <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.</p>
<p>My Books, I found on coming here, had gone a curious road: out of my hands altogether; the new Booksellers had been obliged to <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> them up at once from the <hi rend="italic">sharkish</hi> Attorney, Fraser&#x2019;s Brother: so they pay me <hi rend="italic">down at once</hi> some four hundred pounds (in all) which is less than the <hi rend="italic">half,</hi> I think, of what the Books were calculated &#x201C;in the course <pb id="pg-14-191" n="14:191"/>of years&#x201D; to have yielded. But I have actually <hi rend="italic">got</hi> the money; I am out of the Shark Fraser&#x2019;s hands; have nothing more to, nor ever shall I trust have more to do, with Bookseller&#x2019;s &#x201C;half-profits&#x201D; and burbles: and so, on the whole, am not at all displeased at this result. These new Booksellers will probably get the Books sold off much sooner than Fraser would have done; I shall then have liberty to publish again, and will make a new bargain for ready-money <hi rend="italic">down</hi>, if I can.&#x2014; Having now done with all my <hi rend="italic">past</hi> Books, I look forward with more and more anxiety to my <hi rend="italic">future</hi> Book, which is not written yet! Alas, the <hi rend="italic">steam</hi> is quite low, and it will take a terrible getting up again. But I hope to make a good Book nevertheless.</p>
<p>I have got my Shower-bath mounted here, and in a still simpler way than the Scotsbrig one: pullies are screwed into the joists of the back kitchen, and a little square frame of wood is fixed against the ceiling round them: to the pullies the mere tin-work of the bath is hung; a <foreign><hi rend="italic">suggle</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently a cover of some kind; but the <hi rend="italic">SND</hi> does not record &#x201C;suggle&#x201D; as a noun, only as a verb, meaning to drink in a sucking way; a &#x201C;suggan&#x201D; is a coverlet for a horse or a bed.</note> of old crumb-cloth, nailed round the frame, hangs like a long square sack down to the very ground, or near it; into the bottom of this we set a big tub, at the top of it hangs the bath; the <foreign><hi rend="italic">suggle</hi></foreign> of a square sack keeps the water about one very well, and there is but little spilt at the mouth of the tub, and that little in a back-kitchen. We have an eminent <hi rend="italic">winch</hi> too, or windlass; whereby Helen herself can manage the filling of the thing. And so it promises to be very useful during the hot months.&#x2014; As yet, however, we have had very little to do with heat; today, for example, with east-wind and no sun, is decidedly what one calls a cold day. In Annandale I fear it fares little better. However, we will not yet predict a new &#x201C;cold summer.&#x201D;</p>
<p>From Alick&#x2019;s Letter I learn that Jenny is with you; which gives me real satisfaction. Jean, I expect, will have the shirt-cloth ready for her by the time she gets back to Gill.&#x2014; Poor Isabella, it seems, is worse than she was; I am very sorry to hear it. She must pick up a heart; by degrees she will learn that nothing really deadly does lie in those miserable stomach-ailments, which depress one down to the very dust: she will become her own Doctor, and understand it far better. Meanwhile it is certainly one of the most entirely distressing diseases; and fills one&#x2019;s whole mind with misery,&#x2014;which however one must rally against, resist, and valiantly cast out! Courage, Isabella!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Recommend me to Jamie, whose face looking over the railing of the jetty is very plain to me just now! My kindest love to one and all of <pb id="pg-14-192" n="14:192"/>you. Let me know, dear Mother, that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are as well as when I left you,&#x2014;alas, I wish you may be able.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<p>Thanks, thanks to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>,&#x2014;and a <hi rend="italic">blessing</hi> rather upon Longman: it will not be I, it will be <hi rend="italic">he</hi> now that the Devil will get for neglecting to do this Service in our generation: behold, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was ready!

<p>Upon the whole we will not speak any more to Booksellers at present: if I do find any &#x201C;History&#x201D; or &#x201C;Pamphletary History&#x201D; to write on this matter, why should I not write it myself, all my own way, independently of any Timber-head whatsoever? The gods have not forbidden me absolutely,&#x2014;except it be by saying: Be lazy, be cowardly, be stupid! Alas, that is their heaviest curse by far.</p>
<p>On Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, I have actually some likelihood to be at Macre<supplied>[ad]</supplied>y&#x2019;s; and shall hope to meet you there.</p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Here are two Notes,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One, <date when="1842-05-19">19 May</date>, from the Rev. John Henderson of Tranent to Jean Donaldson; another from Jean Donaldson to TC, <date when="1842-05-20">20 May</date>, enclosing the first. Henderson wrote about Mrs. Begg&#x2019;s respectability, adding: &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Begg had no Son educated for the Church. He was a Medical Student but on the death of his Father &#x2026; his education was stopt, &#x26; he was appointed School master at Ormeston &#x26; with whom his Mother resided.&#x2014; But falling into some of the Failings of his talented Uncle he was many years ago obliged to give up his Situation &#x26; went to Canada where he lives in very poor Circumstances. &#x2026; I cannot help saying that there is more of Christian feeling in administering to the Comfort of a beloved Sister of the Poet, than in erecting Monuments to his memory which is best preserved by his writings&#x201D; (MS: Trinity College). Jean Donaldson wrote agreeing with this, &#x201C;though at the same time I think it is a shame there are so many nephew<supplied>[s]</supplied>, who if every one were to contribute a triffle, might have had a pleasure in preventing the near relative of so distinguished a person from appealing to the public.&#x201D;</note> just received, concerning the Sister of Burns. The things stated there I consider as authentic, and equivalent to facts <pb id="pg-14-193" n="14:193"/>that one has <hi rend="italic">seen</hi>. Inspection therefore being complete, ought not action straightway to begin? Hands to the work:&#x2014;and no &#x201C;dilettantism,&#x201D; <foreign><hi rend="italic">mon brave</hi></foreign> [my brave man]; but a right hearty shove, as in a business one is earnest about!&#x2014;</p>
<p>It seems to me we ought to attack your great Premier<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peel.</note> for a pension of &#xa3;100 to this poor Widow,&#x2014;or if it could be made, with reversion of &#xa3;50 each to her two meritorious Daughters, that would be still better. In the name of all that is left of <hi rend="italic">Hero-worship</hi>, of Divine (that is) and of Humane, in this distracted Earth, I conjure and summon you, Richard Milnes, to stand forth valiantly in this matter, and do what is right and requisite! Not the &#x201C;possible&#x201D;; <foreign><hi rend="italic">faire l&#x2019;</hi><hi rend="small-caps">im</hi><hi rend="italic">possible</hi></foreign> [to do the impossible],<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;<foreign>Impossible</foreign>?&#x2019; cried Mirabeau to his secretary, &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Ne me dites jamais ce b&#xEA;te de mot,</hi></foreign> Never name to me that blockhead of a word!&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Chartism, Works</hi> 29: 191).</note> that is the point. <foreign>Allons</foreign> [Forward]!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Will you be at home for me on Wednesday<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1842-05-25">25 May</date>.</note> about 3 o&#x2019;clock, with some news about the thing. I will try to get Lockhart also to give us some meeting in your neighbourhood. Or if you see him, in the interim, make you an engagement for us both, and I will stand to it. If you answer nothing, I will consider 3 o&#x2019;clock and Wednesday as fixed. Write, otherwise, and fix your own day and hour; and I, on Wednesday, can meet Lockhart myself.</p>
<lg><l>&#x201C;Blessed is he that wisely doth</l>
<l>The poor man&#x2019;s case consider;</l>
<l>For when the time of trouble is,</l>
<l>The Lord will him <hi rend="italic">deliver</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Metrical Ps. 41:1.</note></l></lg>
<p>Consider the rapid advance of <hi rend="italic">Chartism,</hi> fall of Corn-Laws, and even of Land-Aristocracies,&#x2014;and be a Poet in your Politics!</p>

<p>I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that I wrote <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of a letter to you some few weeks ago&#x2014;immediately after receiving your last&#x2014;but whether I finished it, and sent it off or whether it shared the fate of many others of my late undertakings and came to an untimely close, I cannot remember, tho&#x2019; it were to save my life!&#x2014; From this you may infer that my memory is tolerably bad&#x2014;indeed all about me has been tolerably bad this long while&#x2014;and I do not feel as if I could ever gather myself up into the old state again in this world.&#x2014; Parted as I had been from my Mother so many years and with so many new objects of interest about me it was not to have been foreseen that her loss could have so completely changed the whole face of my existence&#x2014;indeed I had never thought about losing her&#x2014;her life seemed always better than my own,&#x2014; What I had thought about, and always the longer the more anxiously, was getting her beside me again that I might show her more love and care in her old age than in the thoughtlessness of my heart I had done heretofore&#x2014; And she had promised me not to keep me unquiet by passing any more winters in that lonely place&#x2014; Had just promised me that &#x201C;if it pleased God we should meet this summer, it should be all arranged according to my wish&#x201D;&#x2014; So many fine schemes I had in my head for her future comfort!&#x2014;too late&#x2014;for her death was already on her and I did not know it&#x2014; She had taken every pains and forced those about her to take every pains to keep me in ignorance of her state&#x2014;&#x201C;a journey at that season would be so dangerous for me.&#x201D;&#x2014; All her last weeks seemed one continued thought about <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;to ward off anxiety from me while she lived and to soften the shock for me should she die&#x2014;in a letter she wrote to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russel&#x2014;after many directions about what was to be done for me if I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be sent for she concluded with these words <pb id="pg-14-197" n="14:197"/>which stick for ever in my heart&#x2014;&#x201C;for Jeannie must be saved in <hi rend="italic">every</hi> way&#x2014;or there is much to be dreaded&#x201D;&#x2014; And when the first stroke came upon her, Margaret Macqueen being by&#x2014;she uttered no thought for her own future only in sinking down exclaimed &#x201C;I am dying Margaret! Oh my poor Jeannie&#x201D;&#x2014; On the Saturday I received a letter from her&#x2014;tender and cheerful as all her late letters had been&#x2014; She had written the day before she said and had nothing new to tell me&#x2014;but as there was no post in London on Sunday if I was kept waiting till Monday I &#x201C;would be making myself uneasy again&#x201D;!&#x2014;and at the time I read that letter she was already dead!&#x2014; On the Monday came no letter from her as promised&#x2014;but one from the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> stating her to be dangerously ill&#x2014;yet not precluding all hope&#x2014;for he feared the blow for me altho at the time he wrote he had no hope himself&#x2014;of course I set out by the next Railway train&#x2014;not despairing&#x2014;Oh no&#x2014;or I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not have gone&#x2014; I thought I had little hope&#x2014;but when all hope was taken from me I found that I had had much. You know the rest&#x2014;I travelled all night in the cruellest suspense and arriving in Liverpool in the morning was told that my uncle and Walter were already gone&#x2014;to her funeral!&#x2014; Oh Bess is it not a wonder that I kept my senses&#x2014; I am better in health now&#x2014;but still very feeble and nervous&#x2014;and so sad!&#x2014; Oh there is such a perpetual weight on my heart as I cannot describe to you&#x2014; I feel as helpless and desolate as a little child turned adrift in the world! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> who have so many friends!&#x2014;but what are friends?&#x2014; What is a husband even compared with ones Mother?&#x2014; Of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> love one is always so sure!&#x2014;it is the only love that nothing&#x2014;not even misconduct on our part can take away from us&#x2014;. If the letter I began went to you, I have said all this before&#x2014;for it is the only sort of thing I have to say to anyone&#x2014;and accordingly I write none at all except to the few whose sympathy I have perfect confidence in&#x2014;</p>
<p>When shall I see you again? here I mean&#x2014;for I do not think I shall ever have the heart to set foot in Scotland any more&#x2014; Alas Alas What a changed Scotland for me&#x2014;a place of graves&#x2014;</p>
<p>My Sweet little Cousin Jeannie is still here with me&#x2014;a comfort so far any companionship <hi rend="italic">can be</hi> a comfort to me&#x2014;</p>
<p>Write to me dear Eliza and do not mind my silences That I have thought of you much during <hi rend="italic">this time</hi> is a sufficient proof of the constancy of regard</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Mother</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>A letter from Jenny came in the beginning of the week; then last night another from her for Jack, which seemed to have been written at the same time, which also I opened as it passed,&#x2014;forwarding them both thereupon to Jack. Jack&#x2019;s address is 3 Chester Terrace, Regent&#x2019;s Park.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His semipermanent address with William Ogilby.</note> Tell Jenny to copy this, and then she will know it henceforth. You must also thank her very kindly for the word she sends me about you and about the rest. I find your eyes are still sore, and I doubt this hot weather will do them no good. Perhaps keeping out of the light as much as possible might be useful. I would also recommend to <hi rend="italic">abstain from rubbing</hi> as much as you can. If Jack know any likely eye water, I will make him send a receipt for it. This is a very troublesome kind of thing:&#x2014;but surely we ought to be thankful that it is not a worse thing too!</p>
<p>Jack was away in the country last week, but is come home again. He was down here on Wednesday night to tea, as fresh and hearty as ever. They are to be in London mainly, I believe, all summer. He will contrive plenty of &#x201C;jaunts&#x201D; &#x26;c., I suppose. It is, as formerly, an idle trade, but a very well paid one. It was precisely on that Wednesday that the Queen had been shot at. These are bad times for Kings and Queens. This young blackguard, it seems, is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> mad at all; was in great want, and so forth; it is said they will hang him. Such facts indicate that even among the lowest classes of the people, Queenship and Kingship are fast growing out of date.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Francis, age 19, had shot at the Queen in her carriage on Constitution Hill, <date when="1842-05-30">30 May</date>. She was aware that he had aimed at her the day before when he was not arrested. He was condemned to death, reprieved because the pistol was apparently not loaded with a bullet, and transported for life. Caroline Fox visited the Carlyles, <date when="1842-06-06">6 June</date>, and noted that TC said: &#x201C;&#x2019;Tis an odd thing this about Queen Victoria. After having had a champion to say before the whole assembly of them, &#x2018;O Queen, live for ever!&#x2019; a little insignificant fellow comes up, points his pistol at her, and says: &#x2018;Chimera! die this minute!&#x2019; Poor little queen! I have some loyalty about me, and have no wish to see her shot; but as for her having any right to hold the reins of government if she could not manage them, all the cart-loads of dirty parchment can&#x2019;t make that clear. There are thousands of men about her made of the same flesh and blood, with the same eternities around them, and they want to be well governed and fed. It is something to get it recognised that the ablest man should be the one to guide us, even if we may never see it carried out&#x201D; (Fox 161, with further accounts of TC&#x2019;s conversation).</note></p>
<p>My poor wife is still very disconsolate, silent, pale, broken-down, and very weak. I urge her out as much as possible; her cheery little <pb id="pg-14-199" n="14:199"/>cousin, too, does what she can. Alas, it is a very sore affliction; we have but one mother to lose. I speak to her seriously sometimes, but speaking cannot heal grief; only Time and Heaven&#x2019;s mercy can.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles&#x2019; visitors about this time all testify to JWC&#x2019;s weakness. Caroline Fox noted, <date when="1842-05-28">28 May</date>: &#x201C;Called at Cheyne Row, where Carlyle and his wife received us with affectionate cordiality. He looks remarkably well and handsome, but she has not at all recovered the shock of her mother&#x2019;s death&#x201D; (Fox 153, with a long account of TC&#x2019;s talk).</note></p>
<p>As for me, I sleep tolerably well, and also have now begun to work a little, which is still better! I shall have a terrible heap of reading, of meditating, sorting, struggling of every kind. But why should not I do it, if it be a good work? I feel as if there did lie something in it. I will grudge no toil to bring it out. I go often all day to the Museum Library and search innumerable old pamphlets, &#x26;c. It is a nasty place, five miles off, and full of heat and bad air, but it contains great quantities of information. I refuse all <hi rend="italic">dinners</hi> whatsoever, or very nearly all. I say, &#x201C;Well, if you do take offence at me, how can I help it? In the whole world there is only one true blessing for me,&#x2014;that of working an honest work. If you would give me the Bank of England, and all set to worship me with bended knees,&#x2014;alas, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would do nothing for me at all. It is not <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that can help me or hinder me; it is I, even I.&#x201D; Pray that I persist in this good course.</p>
<p>Poor Isabella does not seem to profit by the warm weather. I would recommend the shower bath to her. I take it daily here. Tell Jenny that there is no hurry about the shirts. She can go on with all leisure. Did Jamie ever learn from me that in the drawer of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> washstand, if he will pull it out, there lies for him a little piece of new stuff for rubbing on his razor strop? I always forgot to mention it. Our weather here is excellent, threatening to be too hot by and by, which, however, I shall not grudge so much this year. Broiling weather to me will be the basis of a plenteous year for all. There is much need of it!</p>
<p>But I must end, dear Mother. I write hardly <hi rend="italic">any</hi> letters except to you, so you will accept this as the best I can do at present. The subscription for Burns&#x2019;s sister is doing well, in Liverpool at least (under John Welsh). My affection to Alick and all of them. You will get this when you go to the Preaching.</p>

<salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>As it is pity that good news should not travel with what speed they can, I give myself the pleasure of writing this to you today, of which you will probably hear from Mr Chambers, more at large, in a day or two.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, has agreed to bestow on you a small Pension of Twenty Pounds a-year, with reversion of Ten Pounds each to your two worthy Daughters should they survive you. Or perhaps it may be so arranged, owing to the official necessities of the case, that your Daughters should be marked down for the Pension at once: but the meaning is, that you are to have Twenty Pounds a year during life, and they Ten Pounds a year each afterwards. Sir Robert will also add, from some other Public Fund, a present donation to you of Fifty Pounds.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes had written to Chambers, <date when="1842-06-06">6 June</date>: &#x201C;Lady Peel has settled on her a pension of 20&#xa3; per. ann. (or 10&#xa3; per. ann. on each of her daughters &#x26; that Sir Robt. Peel has added a donation of 50&#xa3; from the royal bounty. / Carlyle &#x26; myself &#x26; other friends of the cause recommend that this should not be too much talked of in Edinburgh, but that the subscription, which of course is going on flourishingly, there, should not be checked, until at least we have added an annuity of 20&#xa3; more.&#x201D; Chambers sent this letter on to Isobel Begg, <date when="1842-06-09">9 June</date> (NLS: Burns Begg Papers, Deposit 328). Milnes also wrote to Isobel Begg on the same date, to the same effect, but in more detail (MS: Huntington Library).</note> The details of the matter, first date of payment &#x26;c, are not yet settled but you may take the fact as sure; I saw the promise yesterday under his own hand.</p>
<p>The chief agent in this good work has been Mr Milnes, a Yorkshire Member of Parliament, himself a Poet, and generous-hearted man to whom it is no burden to owe kindness.</p>
<p>Properly, however, you do not owe this to anybody but to your own illustrious Brother; whose noble life, wasted tragically away, pleads now aloud to men of every rank and place for some humanity to his last surviving Sister. May God give you all good of this gift, and make it really useful to you!</p>
<p>There are other small presents from private persons still to be collected; which process Mr Milnes and I are of opinion ought still to go on; and we are in hopes of thereby getting something more for your benefit.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-201" n="14:201"/>You need not answer this Letter: it is a mere luxury that I give myself, the writing of it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Begg&#x2019;s da., Isabella, wrote to TC, <date when="1842-06-09">9 June</date>: &#x201C;I cannot find language to express half the gratitude we all feel. &#x2026; You have indeed gladdened the latter days of one, who with none of the genius of Burns&#x2019; has all his keen sensibility to kindness &#x2026; may God! bless <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the generous givers, and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that have had a hand in it&#x2014; Since Lady Peel so kindly offers to settle her bounteous Pension on either her, or her Daughters, she would prefer the later, assured that whilst they have she will never want, she would have wrote herself but cannot from the effects of a broken Arm.&#x201D;</note></p>

<p>I wished to write to you yesterday, but my <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> was jumping about at such a cruel rate that I thought it best to make as little <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> as possible serve the turn&#x2014; Today I am a little better of it, not much&#x2014;and besides we are expecting Mrs Macready to stay with us till night,&#x2014;so still I cannot write to you as I should like&#x2014;but a line or two I <hi rend="small-caps">will</hi> send; just to say how grateful I felt for your affectionate letter&#x2014; I know not how it is but in these two letters you have written to me lately it is no longer my cousin Helen that I find, but rather my <hi rend="italic">Aunt</hi> Jeannie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maternal aunt (d. <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>).</note>&#x2014;the helpfulest and most gentle-hearted mortal that ever God made&#x2014; I think you like <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, and begin to love you as I loved <hi rend="italic">her</hi>&#x2014; You could not wish for a better recognition of all your goodness to me&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Before going out to the Museum, I will write you a single word about the poor Widow Begg, the Sister of Burns at Tranent. By dint of the requisite exertions here, chiefly on the part of Milnes (of Fryston in Yorkshire) whom I set a-working, Peel has been prevailed upon to grant her a Pension of &#xa3;20 a-year, which also is to be continued in the shape of &#xa3;10 a-year to each of her two Daughters should they survive her. He makes farther a present donation of &#xa3;50 from some other public fund at his disposal. Is not this good news? The poor Widow had already &#xa3;10 a-year from some Scotch charity: she will now have &#xa3;30 and this &#xa3;50 to start with, besides what the Subscription will still yield, will entirely set her up, poor body. Milnes is the man I staid with in Yorkshire, last year; a very good little man indeed. Had Chambers<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Chambers.</note> been left to himself, as he requested to be, it seems as if he would have made but a poor figure: last time I heard, he had contrived to get just one subscription: a single guinea from Menteath <pb id="pg-14-203" n="14:203"/>of Closeburn!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles S. Menteath, who had moved to Edinburgh; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420404-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-04-04">4 April</date></ref>.</note> Let us be glad that a little good has been got done, and a deserving person relieved in her old age.</p>
<p>Neither &#x201C;His Grace&#x201D; nor any Factor of his has yet sent me the smallest word about Templand. Very lucky that I do not depend on them and their decision for a living! It is small all the power they have over me, or are ever like to get, in this world or the next! Let us be thankful.</p>
<p>Here is a Paper that some of my admirers have written, I think, in some Newspaper: It came to me yesterday in this state.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note>&#x2014; Dear Mother are you well, as I am? I must not add a word more or I shall get into a regular writing bout. Let Jenny send a Paper when you and she get to the Gill. <closer><salute>Ever your affec<hi rend="italic">te</hi></salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I will write you a little word today, that you may get it on Sabbath when you come over to the preaching. I hear nothing from you; but I force myself as much as possible to believe that all is moderately right. Your eyes, I doubt, are still sore; there is a kind of disorder in the eyes going about at present: indeed this hot parched weather must be itself very bad for the eyes. I hope you will write to me soon, and say specially how you are.</p>
<p>We have as hot a summer as need be here; which has the effect, among other things, of making me extremely lazy: I never hardly felt more incapable of hard work. I stay at home all day, for most part, among my books; then out towards night for a walk. There is no <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> as yet; nothing comes upon paper, but perhaps there is something taking root under ground! We shall see by and by.&#x2014; I have even grown too lazy for seeing almost anybody; I generally refuse all invitations whatsoever,&#x2014;&#x201C;cannot be <foreign><hi rend="italic">fashed</hi></foreign> [bothered]&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; a catch phrase possibly taken up from Elizabeth Hamilton, <hi rend="italic">The Cottagers of Glenburnie</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>) ch. 7.</note> &#x201C;what&#x2019;s ta use on&#x2019;t?&#x201D; Often too I am very much discontented with myself: how can I help it? By and by a <hi rend="italic">brisker</hi> time will come for me; and a little <hi rend="italic">right</hi> work again: it is the only thing of any value in this distraction of the world at all.&#x2014;</p>
<p>The grass is all brown here; hardly a green spot to be seen: I understand there is every prospect of a good crop over the Island; this ought to reconcile me to a little heat. I hope even Annandale will prosper this year; and that things will go better with all of you and with everybody. There is great need of it everywhere at present! I hope <hi rend="italic">showers</hi> too are not so scarce with you as here: <hi rend="italic">we</hi> can get no rain at Chelsea; the other day there was thunder, and a fine black shower was seen travelling from the North; but it <hi rend="italic">stopt</hi> when half-way thro&#x2019; London, and <hi rend="italic">we</hi> got nothing of it!&#x2014; &#x2014; I sleep pretty well; am fully as healthy as while with you lately: that is good so far as it goes. My window-blinds, in this drawing-room or Library where I now sit, keep out the Sun very reasonably; I can strip off my flannel shirt when the heat gets excessive, and then slip it on again when the Sun veils himself. Besides I have now a nice little <hi rend="italic">back</hi>-closet on the third story of the house, to which I retire in the evenings when the Sun is quite gone from it: there I can sit and read; smoking at intervals; and looking out towards the East, over gardens, over a flat region almost filled for me <pb id="pg-14-205" n="14:205"/>with trees, with a few red roofs of houses rising thro&#x2019; them; the gilt cross and ball of St. Paul&#x2019;s, 4 or 5 miles off, glittering in the extreme horizon, Westminster Abbey and some few other steeples visible nearer hand. It is one of the prettiest outlooks one can have from a Chelsea window; almost from any kind of window in so flat a region of the world. London lies with its great smoke-cloud, safe in the distance; and at night the gas of it makes a ring of beautiful light half round the sky. I sit there, and think of you many a time,&#x2014;and of all imaginable things. I say to myself: &#x201C;Why shouldst thou not be thankful? God is great; God is good: all this Life is a heavenly Miracle&#x2014;great tho&#x2019; stern and sad!&#x201D;&#x2014; Poor Jane and her Cousin sit in the low room; which extends thro&#x2019; the whole breadth of the house, and has windows on both sides. There they sew, read, see company&#x2014;and keep it out of my way. Poor Jane is still very sad; takes fits of crying, and is perhaps still more sorrowful at times when she does not cry. I try to get her advised out as much as possible. John Sterling is come to London for these two weeks, home from Italy; he will be a new resource to her. She seems to get no good of anything but the sympathy of her friends.</p>
<p>Mrs Buller is here, or was here two days ago and for some weeks before: she has exacted a promise that we are to come and see them in Suffolk by and by. I should like a little work done first!&#x2014; She made me go the other night to the House of Commons, to hear Charles speak on the Scotch Church Question. The Scotch Church Question was found to be in a wrong condition as to <hi rend="italic">form</hi>, and could not come on till the <date when="1842-07-05">5th of July</date>:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The second reading of the bill about Church of Scotland patronage, which was in the orders of the day, could not be proceeded with on <date when="1842-06-15">15 June</date> as it apparently interfered with the Crown&#x2019;s patronage and should not have been introduced without the Crown&#x2019;s consent. TC heard Fox Maule give notice of an address on the bill, <date when="1842-07-05">5 July</date>, but it was then put off for six months (<hi rend="italic">Hansard</hi>, <date when="1842-06-15">15 June</date>, 63:1585). TC describes the scene in the Forster MS f.55v.: &#x201C;Besides the English Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> still exists; the last of our traditions in which some men still hope. I have looked upon it myself, not without astonishment, not without some earnestness of curiosity. There it still sits and simmers, passing thousands of acts yearly, delivering acres of printed talk yearly, at present in what they call the Reformed State; perhaps the strangest phenomenon under the sun at the moment. &#x2026; Young men and old in frock<supplied>[coats]</supplied> and trousers with their legs folded, with their hats on, free and easy, mutually conversing, humming Manifold; unfortunate dull orator entirely inaudible amid the din. Yonder, at the farthest end, however, sits one antique figure in grey copious wig&#x2026; ; list, list, it is the Speaker: &#x2018;Say Aye, Say No!&#x2019; &#x2026; not a soul heeds him; whereupon, straightway &#x2026; the Ayes have it!&#x201D; Charles Buller (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">48</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3913"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).</note> however, being there at any rate I determined to wait a little. It struck me as the strangest place I had ever sat in, that same House! There was a humming and bustling, so that you could hear <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> for most part; the Members all sitting with their hats on, <pb id="pg-14-206" n="14:206"/>talking <hi rend="italic">to one another</hi>, coming and going: you only <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> the Speaker (a man with an immense powdered wig, in an old-fashioned elevated chair) and <hi rend="italic">half</hi> heard him mumbling, &#x201C;Say Aye, say No; the Ayes have it!&#x201D;&#x2014;passing Bills, which nobody except one or two, specially concerned, cared a fig about, or was at the pains to listen to! When a good speaker rose, or an important man, they grew a little more silent, and you could hear. Peel was there, and on his feet;&#x2014;poor Peel, he is really a clever-looking man: large substantial head; roman nose, massive cheeks, with a wrinkle half smile half sorrow on them; considerable trunk and belly, sufficient, stubborn-looking, short legs; altogether an honest figure of a man: he had a dark coloured surtout on, and cotton trousers of blue-striped jane: a curious man to behold there under the summer twilight.&#x2014; &#x2014; But I must break off, dear Mother, for here you see my paper is done. I wish somebody would tell me particularly how Isabella is, what she now suffers from &#x26;c. I have yet heard no word more of the Duke.&#x2014; <closer><salute>My blessings with you all! <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother. Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your Letter has this moment arrived; for which be many thanks. I have heard nothing either from Scotsbrig; except a very short imperfect <pb id="pg-14-207" n="14:207"/>Notice from Jenny that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> was just going back to Gill, <supplied>[and]</supplied> that my Mother did not mean to ac<supplied>[company]</supplied> her at present. The reason assigned was that Austin<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Austin, TC&#x2019;s brother-in-law.</note> had somehow failed to come for them at the appointed day. Our Mother was represented to be in her usual state of health. I wrote to her yesterday. Today I must write some kind of Note to Jenny about the Shirts.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Duke,&#x201D; it seems, has put Jardine into Templand, according as I bargained; and, &#x201C;it is thought,&#x201D; will in consequence pay me the &#xa3;100; but has not been pleased yet to signify any portion of his ducal resolution on the subject to me. Hunter of Morton Mill wrote to that effect; I have heard <supplied>[no]</supplied> more whatever. They have me <supplied>[in their]</supplied> power, to that length,&#x2014;thank God, no hairsbreadth farther! They shall wholly do their own way in it.</p>
<p>Our weather here is as hot as anywhere, and hitherto without the smallest wetting of rain. For the last two days however we have veiled sky, a <hi rend="italic">smell</hi> of moisture, and the heat indeed altogether abated. I carry on in it as well as usual; keep within doors till night &#x26;c: no work comes yet <hi rend="italic">on paper;</hi> Heaven knows when it will, for the thing seems to lie miles deep, and gets ever deeper as I dive for it!&#x2014; Jane <supplied>[improv]</supplied>es, but very slowly; she is better for <supplied>[going]</supplied> out; but requires great persuasion before she will move. They will go and see your Miss Grierson;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420630-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1842-06-30">1 July [30 June]</date></ref>. One of TC&#x2019;s maternal aunts had married a Grierson; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300211-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:71</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-02-11">11 Feb. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> whose place is handy for us; two miles off&#x2014;or not much more; and in the road to almost all our <foreign>rendezvouses</foreign> in town. I will write again when they have seen her, or as soon after as I can manage. This scrap is only a penny-worth, to put you off till then.</p>
<p>We have got a Pension of &#xa3;20 for Burns&#x2019;s Sister, which is also to be continued to her Daughters! This was well done. The poor Widow had &#xa3;10 a-year already, and so will now be beyond want. The Subscription is still to do what it can (this of the Pe<supplied>[nsion to be]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">kept totally secret</hi>, mark that)<supplied>[; without secre]</supplied>cy <hi rend="italic">it</hi> will do no great feats.

<p>Yesterday this scrap of a Liverpool Newspaper came inclosed in a Letter from Mr Welsh, my Wife&#x2019;s Uncle, to whom some time ago you sent a set of <hi rend="italic">Begg</hi> Circulars.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420403-TC-RC-01">TC to RC, <date when="1842-04-03">3 April</date></ref>.

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I dwell within a mile or two of the great Premier, and might see the face of him any evening by walking up to his House of Commons, it is doubtful, for all that, whether I am any nearer him than you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Robert Peel lived at 4 Whitehall Gardens. TC was writing in answer to Spedding&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1842-06-21">21 June</date>, in which he had said: &#x201C;The Newspapers are full of famine, and, for legislative remedy, endless debates about bribery at Elections.

Do these great Conservatives purpose to do anything at all? &#x2026; I &#x2026; should like to know what you think in particular at this present; and if there is not a hope that the thickly gathering distress may make Peel a wiser man in spite of himself than he has yet been, before it is too late.&#x201D;</note> Nay some suspect that by clutching his very button, or even taking him by the forelock, and bidding him speak or die, you would still get little nearer <hi rend="italic">him</hi>,&#x2014;for that in fact, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is a Cagliostro, and has his residence in the extensive country of <hi rend="small-caps">nowhere</hi> (not without neighbours); or, in plainer words, floats and hovers as a mere Hypothesis, Expediency, and distressed Noah&#x2019;s Raven,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Gen. 8:7. For &#x201C;Count Cagliostro,&#x201D; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 28:249&#x2013;318.</note> studious to descry on what floating carrion he may alight for moments, till the Deluge swallow him and it <hi rend="italic">as late as possible!</hi> From no man, Peel nor Anti-Peel, do I hear the smallest whisper of any plan for dealing with the evil day which has at length come upon us. I suppose the people will revolt, not willing to die like Hindoos; and the Government will order out dragoons. A Chartist Parliament, not far in the rear of that, seems likeliest to many: Peel will swiftly thereupon have no difficulty in pointing <pb id="pg-14-210" n="14:210"/>out a &#x201C;peculiar burden&#x201D; or two lying upon land! A Chartist Parliament or any form of Democracy is, with me, equivalent to Anarchy, and what the Yankees call &#x201C;Immortal Smash&#x201D;  the Chartist Parliament, as all Parliaments at any rate are very diligently doing, having once altogether discredited itself, there enters some kind of Cromwell (would to God we had him!), drives them out with bayonets <foreign><hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi></foreign> [from the rear],<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Also an argument from effect to cause.</note>&#x2014;and we are at sea on the widest Chaos, with &#x201C;supply and demand&#x201D; for a nautical time-keeper, and the &#x201C;Greatest Happiness of the greatest number&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Benthamite aim.</note> for a pole-star! So sings the Sibyl.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Seriously speaking I do not like to look at the state of England. I can predict nothing of it except that in all likelihood great and long-continued miseries are at no large distance from us. For, as I say in the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> dialect, not yet speaking readily any other, All men rich and poor, have forgotten for several generations that there is any <hi rend="small-caps">god</hi> in this universe,&#x2014;except perhaps some wretched shovel-hatted<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s term of disdain for the Anglican priesthood.</note> simulacrum, worse than no God,&#x2014;and we find now at last, what all mortals in all times have at last found, that such godless hypothesis of the universe is <hi rend="italic">not true</hi>, that the universe managed in that way becomes unmanageable,&#x2014;and we, with our expediency, our supply and demand, our greatest happiness principle, and other melancholy stomach-philosophy, are greater asses than they that believed in witch-craft were! Ah me, the Scotch people say of this or the other man, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Thou</hi> wouldst do little for God, if the Devil were Dead&#x201D;:&#x2014;and truly it is a kind of comfort to reflect that, at worst the Devil does never die; that always there are, at worst, general starvations, chartisms, French Revolutions, with guillotines and apparatus, that Quackery, if it will not disappear otherwise (which one seldom finds it do), may be burnt out of the way by hellfire!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I dare not enter on another sheet; for indeed I am told Sterling is down stairs. Write to me again, and I will answer. And so <foreign>adieu</foreign> for this day; and good be with you all days.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After TC had written Spedding about Arnold, <date when="1842-05-10">10 May</date>, Spedding wrote, <date when="1842-06-21">21 June</date>, after Arnold&#x2019;s death, <date when="1842-06-12">12 June</date>: &#x201C;How soon your Naseby fellow-pilgrim has gone over to the majority! What manner of man was he at bottom? A really good schoolmaster must be one of the best of citizens in these times.&#x201D; Unfortunately TC did not reply to Spedding&#x2019;s question. But Mary Arnold had written to TC, <date when="1842-06-03">3 June</date>: &#x201C;It is so rare a thing for my Husband to allow himself so much of a Holiday, that to think of him&#x2014;you&#x2014;&#x26; myself&#x2014;on &#x2018;Stormy Mill Hill&#x2019; as you call it, stands out as a great event in our History&#x2014; &#x2014;yet to me I confess nothing is more delightful in my memory of that day, than sitting in my quiet corner, &#x26; listening to the conversation between you in going &#x26; returning.&#x201D; Arnold had added: &#x201C;Your kind present to my Wife has emboldened me to do what otherwise I should scarcely have ventured to do, and request your Acceptance of a Copy of my late Oxford Lectures. &#x2026; I think that I have spoken of the Puritans in a way with which you at least will sympathize.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I have been scribbling along in a most confused way all week, making out <hi rend="italic">lists</hi> &#x26;c of my Cromwell Parliament, which have quite stupefied me, and disgusted my mind with all writing whatsoever:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A list of Members of the Long Parliament, dated <date when="1842-06-27">27 June 1842</date>, is to be found in one of TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> notebooks at Yale, with the note added, <date when="1849-10-00">Oct. 1849</date>, &#x201C;lost me a week once.&#x201D; See the list appended to <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 8:315&#x2013;41.</note> otherwise I should have sent you a word in fulfilment of my promise sooner. The two Jeannies called upon your Miss Grierson about a week ago; they found her well and thriving; in good heart, a likely Scotch <foreign>Lass</foreign>; the chief thing that seemed to press upon her &#x201C;The want of a language,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> for she was getting out of Scotch and had not yet got fully into English! She has not to work <hi rend="italic">too</hi> hard, gets to bed at 10 rises at 5; and then the busy season will be over in a few weeks now. In short they report every way favourably of her; as of one likely to prosper in her object here. Jane speaks of asking her to come down some Sunday Evening; but did not know whether at bottom that would do anything for her. However, I wish you would apprise the young woman very distinctly of our address, and also of the fact that if ever any difficulty occur for her, or any service that we could do, she is thoroughly welcome to all help of ours, and invited to come and let us know.</p>
<p>Your Note about Scotsbrig was very welcome: we had a Letter from my Mother herself not long before; with a postscript by Jamie and a Note from Alick inclosing the whole. I am much pleased with your project for Arbigland<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 10 mi. S of Dumfries on the Solway; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400506-TC-JCA-01"><sic>12:135</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1840-05-06">6 May 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> bathing in autumn, and hope you will <hi rend="italic">insist</hi> of our good Mother going with you, for it will certainly do her good. I also embrace the Portrait project for the same occasion; and will leave <pb id="pg-14-212" n="14:212"/>the details of it all to James and the Limner Maxwell,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maxwell of Dumfries, of whom nothing has been traced. He was evidently an alcoholic, and is said to have d. soon after finishing his portrait of TC&#x2019;s mother, now in Carlyle&#x2019;s House, Chelsea. Reprod. frontispiece, vol. 13 [available in the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi> on the table of contents page for volume 13].</note>&#x2014;and do hereby request him to <hi rend="italic">see it done</hi>, in the best and truest way he can. Now mind this!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My own work here is as untowardly as need be; but I do not give it up; I struggle on, and hope to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> some good come of it one day;&#x2014;as yet there is absolutely nothing <hi rend="italic">above</hi> ground, and Heaven knows whether much below!&#x2014; Jane continues, I think, to improve; tho&#x2019; very slowly: she had a loss of sleep the night before last, headache in consequence, and is rather below par today. Our Summer is said to be the hottest and &#x201C;beautifullest&#x201D; these sixteen years: I get along wonderfully notwithstanding; I lower my green blinds; fly to the back of the house; above all, do not go out of doors in the hot blazing days till nightfall. I have passed no summer so solitarily for a long while; and I seem to agree with that plan. For the last three weeks, however, we have had and still have showers; and the weather is not at all unbearable with heat. John Sterling was here for a fortnight: he lugged me out somewhat, made us all go to Hampton-Court palace and picture-gallery &#x26;c:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fresh from Italy, Sterling was full of enthusiasm for Italian art; see Fox 165&#x2013;66. On this visit a doctor with &#x201C;the highest medical authority&#x201D; wrongly assured him that he had &#x201C;gradually mended for some years&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:231). Sterling told Caroline Fox of the visit to Hampton Court: &#x201C;Carlyle was in gloomy humour and finding fault with everything, therefore Sterling defended with equal universality&#x201D; (Fox 169).</note> otherwise I live almost as silent as last year in the horrible dog kennel at Newby. My one aim, if I could attain it, is to get some more work out of myself!</p>
<p>There are some Books here which I am about sending to Annandale. James will get a cart of them;&#x2014;the chief indeed is a Book of Wood-cuts long intended for himself. So soon as I have got the stock rightly put together, they shall go off to Edinburgh. My new Bookseller says he has a Parcel almost weekly thither.</p>
<p>Do you often write to Jenny? Keep your ear open to her, keep her in a state of <hi rend="italic">freedom</hi> and readiness to speak with you; I doubt if she freely communicates with any other. Poor Jenny:&#x2014;let her know always that whatever I can do is <hi rend="italic">hers</hi>. She will gradually come to some resolution of her own, I hope: the sooner she entirely expunges Hanning from her recollection (if that were possible) will be the better!&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Sister.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Matters go on very lazily with me today, and I am very far from having accomplished anything like a day&#x2019;s work yet: nevertheless I will not omit, before going farther, to send a line of answer to your Annandale news of this week. There was a Letter from you, one from Jamie, and a beautiful little drop of utterance and intelligence from our Mother. A blessed spirit reigns in what she says; it is touching and beautiful, that way she has of looking at the world. I like to hear her, to think of her far away in the little room at Scotsbrig yonder. You shall have this little Note to read to her when she comes to the Preaching next.</p>
<p>Nothing new occurs with us here. Jane is still altogether weakly, but she grows better; Time alone can alleviate that kind of sorrows. She is left very lonely in this world now; her kindred mostly gone; very few of the people vaguely called &#x201C;friends&#x201D; worth much to her! It would <pb id="pg-14-214" n="14:214"/>be better for her, also, if she had more imperative employment to follow: a small part of the day suffices for all her <hi rend="italic">obligating</hi> work; and the rest, when she cannot <hi rend="italic">seek</hi> work for herself, is apt to be spent in sorrowful reflexions. Her good cheerful little Cousin is still here. We must hope for gladder days.</p>
<p>I know not if I ever mentioned to you that the Wine from Leith was all found right; and the two bottles of it we have tried were of satisfactory quality;&#x2014;wanting nothing but <hi rend="italic">time</hi> to make it excellent; which want it is likely to get supplied, for we use very little of it, or of any drink whatever. The carriage of the Templand things, I ought to have told you too, amounted in all to something above &#xa3;10; Jane thought it cheap; I knew not whether cheap or dear, for the accurate weight never was specified to me. Let me add that I yet hear no farther word from His Grace; and am determined to let him have his time: I regret only that I had not flung the whole matter at his feet straightway, and thereby saved myself an infinitude of vain clatter and <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash:</hi></foreign>&#x2014;but that would not have been right either. All <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be right by and by!</p>
<p>Jack comes to us, as usual, once a week; he seems altogether well and in good spirits: he is growing fast rich in money, but has little other possession, poor fellow. He does not kick against the pricks<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Acts 9:5.</note> too much. Perhaps for him too better things are in store.</p>
<p>As for me I keep within doors very much; in the warm blazing days I do not stir out at all till nightfall, and then make a long solitary excursion. I have never suffered much from the heat yet; tho&#x2019; this summer is called one of the warmest,&#x2014;and I hope will bring a good crop for one thing! However, for the last three weeks we have <hi rend="italic">veiled</hi> weather, and sometimes (last night, for example) pretty free showers of rain.&#x2014; The distress of the country appears to mount higher and higher;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1842-07-02">2 July</date> there were food riots in Dumfries, when a crowd of some 500 broke the windows of various meal merchants and plundered them each side of the Nith.</note> London I believe is freer of it than most towns: what the issue or the remedy is to be no mortal knows. Alas, it is needless accusing Peel; we are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> to blame; we have forgotten what was right and reasonable, seeking after Mammon, vanity, and our own lusts; we have travelled long on that path, and it leads us <hi rend="italic">towards ruin</hi>, as the like has ever led all men, and ever will lead!</p>
<p>My work makes no appearance at all on paper yet; but perhaps it will some day. I do not give it up, I wriggle and struggle along after it, endeavouring the best I can: it is not a pleasant stage of labour, to <pb id="pg-14-215" n="14:215"/><hi rend="italic">see</hi> nothing above ground: but the pleasant stage will perhaps come yet! Let us try.</p>
<p>I have got into the way of always sending off the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> to poor John Carlyle in Canada; I suppose it may be a kind of benefit there. I myself hardly ever spend 15 minutes over it,&#x2014;mere froth and clatter not <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> reading.</p>
<p>Tell my dear Mother I will write soon to herself. Remember me to your own Jenny, to little Jane and my faithful Postman Tom. Good be with you all; I wish and pray for your good! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother; God keep you and assist you in all things. Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Mother</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>Before setting to my work, let me expend a penny and a scrap of paper on you, merely to say that we are well, and to send a bit of ugly and curious public news that you cannot yet have heard of. On Saturday night it was publicly made known that Francis, the man who last shot at the Queen, was not to be hanged but to be sent to Botany Bay, or some such punishment. Well, yesterday about noon, as the Queen went to St. James&#x2019; Chapel, a third individual presented his pistol at the Majesty of England, but was struck down and seized before he could fire it; he and another who seemed to be in concert with him are both laid up.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John William Bean, age seventeen and deformed, escaped at first, but was arrested next day. Because his pistol had been loaded with nothing but bits of tobacco-pipe and gravel, he was found guilty not of high treason but of &#x201C;a misdemeanour in assaulting the Queen.&#x201D; He was sentenced to eighteen mos. imprisonment. The first man had been Edward Oxford, <date when="1840-06-10">10 June 1840</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400703-TC-JOST-01"><sic>12:187</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1840-07-03">3 July 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> There is no doubt of the fact. The two are both &#x201C;young&#x201D; men; we have yet heard nothing more of them than that. The person who struck down the pistol (and with it the man, so vehement was he) is said to be a gentleman&#x2019;s flunkey; but I do not know that for certain and have seen no newspaper yet. &#x2026; Are not these strange times? The people are sick of their misgovernment, and the blackguards among them shoot at the poor Queen: as a man that wanted the steeple pulled down might at least fling a stone at the gilt weathercock. The poor little Queen has a horrid business of it,&#x2014;cannot take a drive in <hi rend="small-caps">her</hi> <foreign><hi rend="italic">clatch</hi></foreign> [clumsy gig] without risk of <pb id="pg-14-216" n="14:216"/>being shot! <hi rend="italic">Our</hi> <foreign>clatch</foreign> is much safer. All men are becoming alarmed at the state of the country,&#x2014;as I think they well may.</p>
<p>Jane and her cousin have this morning been got off to Windsor by the Sterlings. The jaunt in the open air will do the poor Wifie good.</p>
<p>John is very well. I parted with him last night near his own house rather after 10 o&#x2019;clock.</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Mrs. Welsh</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>I have read your letter with the deepest interest&#x2014;not a word of this &#x2018;ugly story,&#x2019; as you may well call it,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Huxley says that Margaret Welsh was &#x201C;a woman of fine character, at once strong and gentle, bearing undeserved misfortune in quiet patience, serene and undismayed.&#x201D; Widowed, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>, &#x201C;she was left with two sons to educate, but twice over her money was cruelly misappropriated. The first time was by the trustee under her husband&#x2019;s will, who speculated with her funds and failed. This was just after the death of her younger son George, the more promising of her two clever sons, in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, at the age of thirteen.&#x201D; By taking work as a governess she was able to see her son John through Edinburgh Univ. Her second financial loss was &#x201C;when Robert Welsh the lawyer, her brother-in-law, died insolvent in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>.&#x201D; He &#x201C;had charge of the estate&#x201D; of his father, John Welsh Sr. (of Penfillan and formerly of Craigenputtoch), who had d. in <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>. John Welsh had had to sell Nether Craigenputtoch to pay his sisters, and then (with such a large family to maintain) Craigenputtoch itself, bought by his eldest son, JWC&#x2019;s father. Yet he eventually prospered and, when he d., divided his &#x201C;property between his other children, &#x2026; leaving nothing&#x201D; to JWC and her mother, perhaps thinking that they were sufficiently provided for. Somehow (in a way that Huxley does not explain) Robert Welsh had secured his own part of the legacy by settling it on his wife, but left no assets for paying Margaret Welsh&#x2019;s share, of &#xa3; 1,200; and his widow &#x201C;refused to part with any of her well-guarded share.&#x201D; TC later noted: &#x201C;&#x2018;Uncle Robert,&#x2019; able lawyer; clever, swift, clear man; tall and lean; had much innocuous vanity, or rather <hi rend="italic">pride</hi> in self &#x26; belongings; perfect veracity &#x26; candour; transparent always as spring water&#x201D; (MS: NLS 533).</note> had <pb id="pg-14-217" n="14:217"/>reached me and I cannot express to you the astonishment and indignation it has filled me with&#x2014;I always considered Mrs. Robert Welsh a cold and worldly-minded woman, but the very <hi rend="italic">prudence</hi> which seemed to me to have outgrown in her all other good qualities, and to have rendered her almost <hi rend="italic">unamiable</hi> in the conduct of her life, would have guarded her, I should have supposed, from such a flagrant transaction as this you tell me of. That the woman should not see that by throwing dishonour on her husband&#x2019;s memory, and making an act of downright dishonesty the basis of her own and her children&#x2019;s future fortunes, betokens a short-sightedness of intellect in her which surprises me, more than the abominable selfishness with which she pursues her own immediate advantage at all costs to others! Dear Mrs. Welsh whatever hardships this injustice may expose you to&#x2014;depend upon it <hi rend="italic">your</hi> John enters the world under better auspices than that other poor boy whom she seeks to advance by such unworthy means. I pity <hi rend="italic">him</hi> more than I pity your son&#x2014;the loss to your son is definite&#x2014;so many hundred pounds&#x2014;who knows but it may turn out a gain by the new stimulus it will give to his own exertions&#x2014;but to John May the evil done is incalculable, and may spread itself over his whole existence&#x2014;such a lesson in base worldliness given to him at such an age and by one whom he is bound to reverence,&#x2014;and a stigma thrown on the name he bears!&#x2014;Oh the blind Mother that she is! But as you say very dignifiedly and properly &#x2018;it is useless casting out reflections on her conduct&#x2019;&#x2014;to commit her to destiny is indeed all one can do with such a person&#x2014;and destiny in its own good time will set that and whatever else is so glaringly wrong&#x2014;to rights again one way or other. Meanwhile be assured that it would be a true satisfaction for me if my husband or I could in any way serve my young cousin&#x2014;who besides being so related to me, is I <pb id="pg-14-218" n="14:218"/>understand a well conducted clever youth. In the way you mention nothing I am afraid is possible for us&#x2014;I know only one person connected with civil Engineers&#x2014;George Rennie my old lover at Haddington, who is my cousin and brother-in-law to Sir John Rennie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23377"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), civil engineer; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350112-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:11</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-01-12">12 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>. George Rennie and Sir John Rennie were cousins, but no relationship has been traced with JWC, so possibly &#x201C;my cousin&#x201D; is an error for &#x201C;the cousin.&#x201D; Their wives are not further identified, but apparently were sisters.</note> the great person here in that line. To him I wrote immediately on receiving your letter, and I shall enclose his answer that you may see the little hope he holds out&#x2014;for next to having <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> hopes realized I hold it best to have <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> ones at once set aside&#x2014;to leave the ground clear for new schemes. I may add that I am <hi rend="italic">perfectly certain</hi> that Mr. Rennie does not throw cold water on the subject from mere indisposition to give himself trouble about it. He would like nothing better than to do me a kindness for the sake of old times, if it lay at all within his ability.</p>
<p>My Cousin Jeanie who is here with me has a cousin in Liverpool<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note>&#x2014;a practical engineer&#x2014;and even he, she tells me has been obliged to dismiss a great many of his people lately&#x2014;all trade is going so rapidly to perdition. But if a young man have talent, patience, and good conduct, never fear but he will make out for himself even in &#x2018;the present distressed state of the country&#x2019; a respectable and useful existence. John has good gifts from nature, and he has the inestimable blessing of an affectionate and brave hearted Mother to sympathize in his struggles and encourage him on. It cannot be but that after so much hardship as you have had in life and borne so creditably <hi rend="italic">some fruits</hi> of your cares and struggles should not arise to gladden you even here below.&#x2014; Write to me whenever you see the shadow of a chance that my husband&#x2019;s influence may be of any help to you&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the present may offer nothing in which we can be of use it may not be always so.</p>
<p>Thank you for the kind letter you wrote to me a good while ago. I meant to answer it at the time, but my health and spirits have been so bad ever since that fearful <date when="1842-02-00">February</date>; that I am hardly to be accused for the many things I have left undone, above all the many letters I have left unanswered&#x2014;I am stronger of late&#x2014;but so sad always&#x2014;and when I look forward to what they call &#x2018;the effects of time,&#x2019; it seems to me as if these would be to deepen my sadness rather than clear it away.&#x2014; I do not know how it is, but I feel as if something had <hi rend="italic">broken</hi> within me, and however long I may live, that my mind can never recover its elasticity any more.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Pray take every care of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> health&#x2014;I know these sicknesses that <pb id="pg-14-219" n="14:219"/>come with vexations and know that no sicknesses need more to be looked to. Give my cousinly regards to John, and believe me always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel</salute>
<p>Will you be so good as give the little parcel to Margaret Hiddlestone with my kind remembrances&#x2014; I do not know her actual address. I send also to your care a little thing for old Mary<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mills.</note>&#x2014; She used to like dearly a bit of <hi rend="italic">finery</hi>, and I flatter myself this handkerchief will quite please her taste&#x2014; I have put up an extra-half crown along with it, which you may tell her is to make her Thursday&#x2019;s dinner a little better than usual&#x2014; She would have had a good dinner at Templand on that day had Templand been what it was&#x2014;for Thursday you must know is my birthday,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She is writing on Tues.</note> and whether I was far or near my Mother never failed to make a sort of celebration of it&#x2014; Alas alas&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">this</hi> <date when="1842-07-14">14<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of July</date>, for the first time in my whole life, I shall miss the Mother&#x2019;s-gift and blessing which always reached me however distant she might be, and however circumstanced&#x2014;it will pass over unnoticed like any other day of the year,&#x2014;only for myself it will be a sorrowful day enough&#x2014;but all my days are sorrowful now so I need not look forward with any particular apprehension to this <hi rend="italic">one</hi>&#x2014; I feel that that stroke so heavy and unexpected has taken away a great piece of my life&#x2014;that I shall never get the better of it. I may not die this long while yet, but henceforth I can only live in the idea of death&#x2014;and perhaps it is better for me so, than that I should return into the state of blind security in which I was living before this affliction came upon me&#x2014; She was everyway so much better than I am, that without some such expiation of sorrow, I should hardly dare to look forward to being reunited to her where she is gone&#x2014;</p>
<p>My husband has been unusually well since his return&#x2014; He is very patient with me, and does all he can to fill her place&#x2014;but who can do that? One can have but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Mother&#x2014; My Cousin Jeannie too, who is still here is very kind, indeed all my friends are kinder to me far than I deserve&#x2014;but somehow their kindness seems to make me only the sadder&#x2014; I think always, Oh if I had but <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to tell about it again; <hi rend="italic">then</hi> it would do me good!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-220" n="14:220"/>Now there, I have written nothing but sad things to you dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel!&#x2014; and when I sat down I meant to write cheerfully&#x2014;but you will see in my putting so little restraint on my thoughts that I feel towards you the trustfulness of a sincere affection and so will not weary of these lamentations&#x2014; We are always glad to see D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russels handwriting on the newspaper,&#x2014;remember us to him kindly and to your father&#x2014; Write to me when you can&#x2014; I want to know about old Mary&#x2014;Margaret&#x2014;and of another&#x2014;the last not for affection&#x2019;s sake I mean that wretched Mary Millegan<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the Mary who was Grace Welsh&#x2019;s maid before Margaret Hiddlestone; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411124-JWC-IC-01">JWC to IC, [<date when="1841-11-24">24 Nov. 1841</date>]</ref>.

<dateline><place>Chelsea</place>, <date when="1842-07-13">13 july, 1842</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My dear Mrs Taylor,</salute>
<p>What you ask of me is very flattering; and seemed so small a matter, in regard to &#x201C;trouble&#x201D; or the like, that I could not but at once accede to your request when Mr Taylor came, that same evening,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Taylor (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), prosperous wholesale druggist, Harriet&#x2019;s husband. In her letter, <date when="1842-07-09">9 July</date>, Harriet had said that he &#x201C;joins in this request and proposes to take an early opportunity for calling at Chelsea to make it in person&#x201D; (F. A. Hayek, <hi rend="italic">John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor</hi> [<date when="1951-00-00">1951</date>] 88).</note> to enforce it and receive my answer.</p>
<p>During these two days, however, there have various doubts arisen in me; and on the whole a serious, practical question, which I now anew submit to your decision, Whether you really ought not to appoint another to that trust;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The trustees of Harriet&#x2019;s marriage settlement had been Joseph Travers (John Taylor&#x2019;s brother-in-law) and Arthur Ley (Harriet&#x2019;s dissolute brother-in-law). She disliked and distrusted Ley; but when Joseph Travers went abroad, in <date when="1842-07-00">July</date>, the future interests of her children were left solely in Ley&#x2019;s hands. She asked TC to fill the vacancy, <date when="1842-07-09">9 July</date>: &#x201C;it is a very simple matter &#x26; could in no way cause any trouble or inconvenience, otherwise I should hardly feel entitled to ask it&#x201D; (Hayek 87).</note> whether I myself, in justice to all interests, ought not still to decline it!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-221" n="14:221"/>The fact is, you have not among all your friends any person, possessed of common sense and arrived at years of discretion, who is so totally unacquainted with every form of what is called Business; nor, I think, unlikelier now ever to become acquainted with it. For example, were the matter (as Mr Taylor assured me this present one could at the utmost only be) that of seeing certain monies properly invested in stock, I should not of myself in the least know when it was &#x201C;properly&#x201D; done, but must depend altogether on the judgement of others. <hi rend="italic">Money</hi> generally is one of my <hi rend="italic">enemies</hi>,&#x2014;whom I never look at except on compulsion, and then with the strangest <hi rend="italic">art of oblivion:</hi> if you will believe me, I do not at this moment (nor at any moment, except for some half hour after I have looked and rummaged among paper bundles) know, within fractions equal to a fourth or a third of the whole, how much money I myself have,&#x2014;easy as that were to count! I understand only that I have &#x201C;money enough for a while to come&#x201D;; and so think no more of it, can think no more of it. Judge whether you would like your dear children&#x2019;s interests in such a hand! Truly I am myself a mere child in regard to all that; besides being every way a kind of hermit, gymnosophist, monk, or whatever my name may be, growing yearly more and more secluded from all worldly things, more and more indifferent to them, heartily indifferent to them all. This is the real fact.</p>
<p>Of my trustworthiness to do what I undertake, and of my true readiness to serve you in a much larger matter, I will not raise any doubt. But it is inconceivable that in your circle of friends there should not be many persons who combine these qualities with some knowledge of practical affairs,&#x2014;one of <hi rend="italic">whom</hi> therefore, and not I, is actually the <hi rend="italic">fittest</hi> and ought to be appointed. On the whole, my dear friend, I will invite you to reexamine the matter, and appoint another!&#x2014; If there be any real necessity why I in particular should creep out of my snail-shell into so unknown a department of things, doubt not I will readily creep out, and do my best when out; but if not, I pray you, for your sake and my own, let me continue to lodge there!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Mr Taylor seemed to say, it would be, at any rate, about a fortnight before the Papers were ready. I will request you to bid him pause for a day or two. I have a notion to come out to Walton,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walton-on-Thames, 17 mi. WSW of London, where the Taylors had a country cottage. TC went with Mill, <date when="1842-07-18">18</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-07-19">19 July</date>, and discussed the matter with her in person; but he continued to insist on his lack of business acumen and so declined. Eventually Joseph Travers&#x2019; brother was appointed.</note> and speak with you of this matter. Could not I walk from Richmond to your house, <pb id="pg-14-222" n="14:222"/>and back again in time, some day,&#x2014;say Saturday or Monday next? You are at home; alas, you are too sure to be at home!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Because of ill health.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Ought we not before long to collect these various Begg monies into one money-sum, and so closing the concern, send it off to chambers, and wash our hands of it? Your beautiful Corn-law legislation will terminate soon, and I shall not even have the possibility of seeing you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably referring to the end of the parliamentary session, <date when="1842-08-12">12 Aug.</date>, and Milnes&#x2019;s departure for Fryston. TC also refers ironically to the govt.&#x2019;s refusal to alter its policy on the Corn Laws. Motions to allow the importation of corn (<date when="1842-07-07">7 July</date>) and to form a committee to consider the repeal of the Corn Laws (<date when="1842-07-11">11 July</date>) both failed. Milnes had reluctantly voted against the govt., <date when="1842-07-07">7 July</date>, because with the failure of the sliding scale, introduced in <date when="1842-02-00">Feb.</date>, to lower the price of corn, he thought that the govt. had a responsibility to relieve &#x201C;the enormous exigencies of the country.&#x201D;</note> What day shall it be, then? I propose Wednesday next, this day week; but am ready for any other you may name:&#x2014;the hour 3 of the afternoon. I will write into the City &#x26;c, and bring all my monies in my pocket; alas, they will not be difficult to carry! On Wednesday at 3,&#x2014;unless you say otherwise.</p>
<p>Your offer for Greenwich touched me to the very heart; but it was too late; too late even for answering.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently an invitation to join an excursion to Greenwich.</note> Miss Martineau will surely make me happy, one day, and able to eat a dinner with satisfaction.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>About a week ago, going to look in our Letter-box after tea (as I regularly do at certain seasons of the day), there lay in it your good little Letter; a very welcome sight to me! Is it not a beautiful thing (among so many ugly things as we complain of) that you can write <pb id="pg-14-224" n="14:224"/>me a line of news, and clap a penny-stamp on it in your room at Scotsbrig, whereby infallibly it will lodge itself, without a word said, in the box behind the door here at Chelsea for me? It struck me much as I took the Letter out that night.</p>
<p>I am very much pleased to hear from yourself, as I had already done from Jean, that you were minded to have a little sea-bathing this summer. Pray do not neglect it, dear Mother; it always does you good: the very journey to a new scene for a while will be beneficial. I have also taken order that they are to catch a small neat Portrait from you while you are at Dumfries! You must not disappoint me in this.</p>
<p>Isabella&#x2019;s illness, I am sorry to learn, still continues. Has she ever tried the Shower-bath? I am convinced it would do her good. There is nothing that has a finer effect in bracing one against weakliness, liability to cold &#x26;c. I <hi rend="italic">regularly</hi> take it the first thing I do in the mornings: if I awake all in a muddy confused condition, I am down stairs forthwith, naked all but my dressing-gown; and in two minutes from awakening, the cold torrent is splashing over me,&#x2014;rousing me to be as lively as a hawk! For a while after, I always feel as if I were <hi rend="italic">completely</hi> well. I wish Isabella would make the experiment. The test of its doing one mischief is that one cannot get to warmth again, that the fingers continue <hi rend="italic">white</hi>, and one is shivery and uncomfortable: if you get readily warm again, it has decidedly done you good. The skin is a most important part of the economy of life for all living creatures, man as well as the others. I believe all of us would be better for <hi rend="italic">currying</hi>, at least for cleaning and rubbing, as much as the horses are!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This Summer in regard to health, I think I have got on really better than any past Summer: I have never been so quiet, resolutely refusing almost all invitations, sitting solitary and silent (not altogether idle either); some times, if the weather be too hot, not so much as going out at all till towards sunset or after. In this way I have suffered but little by the heat. Indeed it has never yet been violent; I am afraid there has been far too little of it for a first-rate harvest. For the last four weeks there have fallen dirty little uncertain showers, no right bout of rain either, and the sky has generally been gray,&#x2014;warm, but not warm <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> for the crops; sometimes with strong winds from the west. Since Monday again the Sun has got out, and the rain all gone; but there is still a brisk air of wind, and we have nothing of the <hi rend="italic">oven</hi> yet. I fear the harvest can only be of <hi rend="italic">moderate</hi> goodness. Heaven knows we never had more need of a good one! The distress that reigns and spreads over many wide spaces of this country is getting absolutely frightful. I would rather sling a wallet and hawk <foreign><hi rend="italic">spunks</hi></foreign> [matches], or lie down in the ditch and die, than be a Peel to keep up Corn-laws <pb id="pg-14-225" n="14:225"/>at such a time! The Landlords and their Peel seem to me to be out of their wits.&#x2014; Alas, we are all far out of our right wits; not one of us but is a fool and a sluggard, and a <hi rend="italic">false</hi> servant more than one way: <hi rend="italic">hence</hi> that misery to one and all of us.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I went one day to the Corn Law Conference:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC presumably went to one of the meetings of the Anti-Corn Law League&#x2019;s national conference, <date when="1842-07-05">5 July</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-08-01">1 Aug.</date> A deputation had seen Peel, <date when="1842-07-09">9 July</date>, when he had refused to comment, as the subject was under discussion in parliament. The League were also discussing what action should be taken if the govt. refused repeal, and were prophesying revolution. They were regarded as partly responsible for the unrest in <date when="1842-08-00">Aug.</date></note> it became painfully clear to me that these poor people too had small chance to do much good. If their Corn-Law repeal were granted them, they would just go on as they had done; amassing money, fulfilling their desires, their appetites and whims; living <hi rend="italic">without</hi> God in the world;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eph. 2:12.</note> therefore, without sympathy for man in the world; answering of their Brother as Cain did: &#x201C;Am I my brother&#x2019;s keeper?&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 4:9</note> I paid my Brother his <hi rend="italic">wages</hi>, no <hi rend="italic">money</hi> more can he ask of me; what more have I to do with him?&#x2014; These men think, and practically believe, there is no other <hi rend="italic">reality</hi> but money at all. They are terribly mistaken; and will learn it by and by!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack was well when he quitted us last; I left him, as usual, on the road homeward with a <hi rend="italic">cigar</hi> in his cheek: he seems always very cheerful at present. Poor Jane gets but slowly better; but I think she does get better. We must have patience.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Today I have wrapt up a great mass of insignificant Books, which are to go by Dumfries: some of them are for Jamie&#x2019;s new book-shelf (not such worthless books); many of them (not very <hi rend="italic">worthy</hi> ones I fear) are for the Ecclefechan Library. They will be at Dumfries in a week or two. Tell Jamie I will write to him by and by without fail. I want Jenny to make me some flannel shirts too (I think); I will send her a Note about them by and by.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Farewell my dear Mother. Go to the bathing, and take <hi rend="italic">good</hi> care of yourself!&#x2014; My blessings with one and all of you.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Maggie,</salute>
<p>It was a good thought in you to send me the little purse&#x2014;and I feel very grateful to you for it&#x2014; This last birthday was very sad for me as you may easily suppose&#x2014;very unlike what it was last year and <supplied>[all?]</supplied> former years&#x2014;and I needed all the heartening kind souls could give me&#x2014;but by your kindness and that of others the day was got over with less of a foresaken feeling than could have been anticipated. Only think of my husband too having given me a little present! he who never attends to such <hi rend="italic">nonsenses</hi> as birthdays&#x2014;and who dislikes nothing in the world so much as going into a shop to buy anything&#x2014;even his own trowsers and coats; so that to the consternation of Cockney-tailors <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am obliged to go about them&#x2014; Well he actually risked himself in a Jewlers shop and bought me a very nice smelling-bottle!&#x2014; I cannot tell you how <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> his little gift made me as well as glad&#x2014;it was the first thing of the kind he ever gave me in his life&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">great</hi> matters he is always kind and considerate, but all these <hi rend="italic">little</hi> attentions which we women attach so much importance to he was never in the habit of rendering to any one&#x2014;his up-bringing and the severe turn of mind he has from nature had alike indisposed him towards them&#x2014;and now the desire to replace to me the irreplacable makes him as good in <hi rend="italic">little</hi> things as he used to be in great<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Carlyle never forgot her birthday afterwards. Regularly, as July came round, I find traces of some remembrance&#x2014;some special letter with some inclosed present&#x201D; (Froude&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Helen&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Welsh&#x2019;s.</note> box arrived this morning&#x2014;so like a Templand box!&#x2014;alas alas&#x2014;those preserves&#x2014; I had thought about making some all this time&#x2014;and never could bring myself to set about it&#x2014;it was not only to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> them but to <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> to make them for me&#x2014;and I had finally settled it with myself that I must be stronger before I did such out of the way things&#x2014; So that in every way Helens present is welcome&#x2014;most of all welcome for the kind consideration it shows for my helplessness and the quantity of really disagreeable labour she has imposed on herself for my sake&#x2014; Give her my kindest love and say I will write in a day or two to herself&#x2014; I have been meaning to write to her every day this week back, but the pigs have always run thro&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Played havoc with; coterie speech.</note> the good intertention&#x2014; Jeanie expresses surprise at the fancy of &#x201C;sending coffee to Chelsea&#x201D;&#x2014;but for my share I find the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">fancy</hi>&#x2019; extremely <hi rend="italic">reasonable</hi> &#x2014;considering <pb id="pg-14-227" n="14:227"/>that when I was in Liverpool I <hi rend="italic">brought</hi> coffee from there to Chelsea&#x2014;and a very good speculation it turned out&#x2014; Thank my Uncle for his golden kiss&#x2014; I am thinking seriously what to do with it&#x2014;as I <hi rend="italic">never eat snaps</hi> [gingerbread biscuits]&#x2014;and besides would rather invest such an amount of capitol in some-thing of a permanent character that might remind me of him more agreeably than by an indegestion&#x2014;but for my life I cannot fix upon any thing that I <hi rend="italic">need</hi>&#x2014;and to buy some-thing that I feel to be superfluity is so little in my way!&#x2014; I think I shall let it lie in the purse for good luck till winter, and then buy something particular cozzy to put about my throat&#x2014;</p>
<p>As to &#x201C;Miss Jeanie&#x2019;s&#x201D; return I can only tell you that neither we nor anybody hereabouts shows any symptoms of &#x201C;tiring of her&#x201D;&#x2014;the first person to <hi rend="italic">tire</hi>, I imagine will be herself&#x2014; Her picture is come home from the framemaker and looks very fine indeed in its gilt ornimentality&#x2014; I think it perfectly like and a beautiful little picture withal, wherein however I differ from many persons who say it &#x201C;is not <hi rend="italic">flattered</hi> enough&#x201D; as if a picture must needs be <hi rend="italic">flattered</hi> to be what it ought to be&#x2014;</p>
<p>We went down the water last night to take tea with the Chaplain of Guy&#x2019;s Hospital<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >F. D. Maurice. Guy&#x2019;s Hospital is in Southwark, S of the Thames, downriver from Chelsea.</note>&#x2014;found him and his wife in the country and had to return <hi rend="italic">tea</hi>less&#x2014;rather belated and extremely cold&#x2014;the consequence of which <foreign><hi rend="italic">betise</hi></foreign> is that today I am hoarse&#x2014;with a soreish head and soreish throat&#x2014;so you will excuse my horrible writing</p>

<salute>My dear Emerson</salute>
<p>Lest Opportunity again escapes me, I will take her, this time, by the forelock, and write while the matter is still hot. You have been too long without hearing of me; far longer, at least, than I meant. Here is a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Letter from you,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1842-07-01">1 July</date>; the first was dated <date when="1842-03-31">31 March</date>.</note> besides various intermediate Notes by the hands of Friends, since that Templand Letter of mine:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1842-03-28">28 March</date>.</note> the Letter arrived yesterday; my answer shall get under way today.</p>
<p>First under the head of business let it be authenticated that the <pb id="pg-14-228" n="14:228"/>Letter inclosed a Draft for &#xa3;51;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Representing the $246 paid to Emerson by James Munroe &#x26; Co. for their sales of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>.</note> a new unexpected munificence out of America; which is ever and anon dropping gifts upon me,&#x2014;to be received, as indeed they partly are, like manna dropped out of the sky; the gift of unseen Divinities! The last money I got from you changed itself in the usual soft manner from dollars into sovereigns, and was what they call &#x201C;all right,&#x201D;&#x2014;all except the little Bill (of &#xa3;8 and odds, I think) drawn on Fraser&#x2019;s Executors by Brown; which Bill the said Executors having refused for I know not what reason, I returned it to Brown with note of the dishonour done it, and so the sum still stands on his Books in our favour. Fraser&#x2019;s people are not now my Booksellers, except in the matter of your <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> and a second edition of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>; the other Books I got transferred to a certain pair of people named &#x201C;Chapman and Hall, 186. Strand&#x201D;; which operation, tho&#x2019; (I understand) it was transacted with great and vehement reluctance on the part of the Fraser people, yet it produced no <hi rend="italic">quarrel</hi> between them and me, and they still forward parcels &#x26;c and are full of civility when I see them:&#x2014;so that whether this had any effect or none in their treatment of Brown and his Bill I never knew; nor indeed, having as you explained it no concern with B&#x2019;s and their affairs, did I ever happen to inquire. I avoid all Booksellers; see them rarely, the blockheads; study never to think of them at all. Booksales, reputation, profit &#x26;c &#x26;c: all this at present is really of the nature of an encumbrance to me; which I study, not without success, to sweep almost altogether out of my head. One good is still possible to me in Life, one only: To screw a little more work out of myself, my miserable despicable, yet living, acting, and so far imperial and celestial <hi rend="italic">self</hi>; and this, God knows, is difficulty enough without any foreign one!</p>
<p>You ask after <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had innocently hoped that &#x201C;the iron Puritan is emerging from the Past, in shape &#x26; stature as he lived.&#x201D; But TC had lost his way with the work on the death of his mother-in-law and during the break that followed. Though he struggled with it most of the summer, he began to find it again only with his visit to the Cromwell country, <date when="1842-09-06">6</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-09-08">8 Sept.</date></note> ask not of him; he is like to drive me mad. There he lies, shining <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> enough to me, nay glowing, or painfully <hi rend="italic">burning;</hi> but far down; sunk under two hundred years of Cant, Oblivion, Unbelief and Triviality of every kind: thro&#x2019; all which, and to the top of all which, what mortal industry or energy will avail to raise him! A thousand times I have rued that my poor activity ever took that direction. The likelihood still is that I may abandon the task undone. I have bored thro&#x2019; the dreariest mountains of rubbish; I have visited <pb id="pg-14-229" n="14:229"/>Naseby Field, and how many other unintelligible fields and places; I have &#x26;c &#x26;c:&#x2014;alas, what a talent have I for getting into the Impossible! Meanwhile my studies still proceed; I even take a gowlish kind of pleasure in raking thro&#x2019; these old bone-houses and burial-aisles now; I have the strangest fellowship with that huge Genius of <hi rend="small-caps">death</hi> (universal president there), and catch sometimes thro&#x2019; some chink or other, glimpses into blessed <hi rend="italic">ulterior</hi> regions,&#x2014;blessed, but as yet altogether <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>. There is no use in writing of things past, unless they can be made in fact things present: not yesterday at all, but simply today and what it holds of fulfilment and promise is <hi rend="italic">ours:</hi> the dead ought to bury their dead, ought they not? In short, I am very unfortunate, and deserve your prayers&#x2014;in a quiet kind of way! If you lose tidings of me altogether, and never hear of me more,&#x2014;consider simply that I have gone to my natal element, that the Mud Nymphs<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pope, <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi> 2:308.</note> have sucked me in; as they have done several in their time!</p>
<p>Sterling was here about the time your Letters to him came: your American reprint of his pieces was naturally gratifying him much.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had first told Sterling, <date when="1841-03-31">31 March 1841</date>, of a projected edn. of his poems by A. L. Russell, an iron manufacturer of Plymouth, Mass., and had requested a list of his prose and verse for Russell, <date when="1842-04-01">1 April</date>. He had also tried to dissuade Rufus W. Griswold of Philadelphia from printing Sterling&#x2019;s poems, pbd. ca. <date when="1842-03-00">March</date>. Sterling wrote to Emerson, <date when="1842-06-06">6 June</date> (&#x201C;Your letter spiced my welcome home&#x201D;), <date when="1842-06-13">13</date>, and <date when="1842-06-28">28 June</date>, and detailed the works he was about to send Emerson for Russell. In <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> Emerson warned Sterling that the project was by then unlikely partly because of the Philadelphia edn. Russell kept Sterling&#x2019;s manuscripts till <date when="1844-07-00">July 1844</date>, when he returned them to Emerson &#x201C;without a word of explanation.&#x201D; See <hi rend="italic">A Correspondence between John Sterling and Ralph Waldo Emerson</hi>, ed. E. W. Emerson (Boston, <date when="1897-00-00">1897</date>) 39, 50, 58, 65&#x2013;67, and Rusk 3:257&#x2013;58.</note> He seems getting yearly more restless; necessitated to find an outlet for himself, unable as yet to do it well. I think he will now write Review Articles for a while; which craft is really perhaps the one he is fittest for hitherto. I love Sterling: a radiant creature; but very restless;&#x2014;incapable either of rest or of effectual motion: aurora borealis and sheet lightening; which if it could but <hi rend="italic">concentrate</hi> itself, as I <supplied>[say?]</supplied> always&#x2014;!&#x2014; We had much talk; but, on the whole, even his talk is <supplied>[not]</supplied> much better for me than silence at present.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling wrote to Emerson, <date when="1842-06-28">28 June</date>, that he had been &#x201C;in the midst of bustle, but with the great delight of seeing Carlyle, who is more peaceful than I have ever known him. He is immersing himself in Puritanism and Cromwell. &#x2026; If he writes our Civil War, the book will have a prodigious advantage over his French Revolution, that there will be one great Egyptian Colossus towering over the temples, tribes and tents around&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> 59).</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Me miserum</hi></foreign> [Woe is me]!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> 1.7.92.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-230" n="14:230"/>Directly about the time of Sterling&#x2019;s departure came Alcott,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amos Bronson Alcott (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888-00-00">1888</date>), American transcendentalist, teacher, and writer; his school in Boston, founded <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, on Pestalozzian principles, had failed, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>.

He has been twice here, at considerable length; the second time, all night.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1842-06-25">25 June</date> and <date when="1842-07-04">4</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-07-05">5 July</date>. Writing to his wife, <date when="1842-07-02">2 July</date>, Alcott said of an hour&#x2019;s visit with TC: &#x201C;ah me! Saul amongst the prophets! It must have been a dark hour with him. He seemed impatient of all interruption: faithless quite in all social reforms. His wit was sombre, severe, hopeless, his every merriment had madness in it; his humour was tragic even to tears: there lay smouldering in him a whole French Revolution&#x2014;a Cromwellian Rebellion nor could the rich mellowness of his voice, deepened as it was, and made more musical by his broad northern accent, hide from me the restless melancholy, the memory feeding on Hope, the decease of all prophesy in the grave of history, wherein with his hero whom he was seeking to disinter, himself was descending&#x2014;a giant mastered by the spirit of his time. &#x2026; We had desultory talk, but none gave me pleasure. The man is sick; he needs rest, he must get that Book off his brain before he can find his better self.&#x201D; And on <date when="1842-07-16">16 July</date> Alcott reported their second meeting: &#x201C;we sped no better than at first. Work! work! is with him both motto and creed; but tis all toil of the brain&#x2014;a draught on the memory&#x2014;a sacrifice of the living to the dead, instead of devotion to living Humanity and a taste of her enobling hopes&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">The Letters of A. Bronson Alcott</hi>, ed. R. L. Herrnstadt [Ames, Iowa, <date when="1969-00-00">1969</date>] 78, 85).</note> He is a genial, innocent, simple-hearted man, of much natural intelligence and goodness, with an air of rusticity, veracity, and dignity withal, which in many ways appeals to one. The good Alcot: with his long lean face and figure, with his grey worn temples and mild radiant eyes; all bent on saving the world by a return to acorns and the golden age; he comes before me like a kind of venerable Don Quixote, whom nobody can even laugh at without loving! I could like much to speak with him, were it not that there is no keeping of him from his one topic long together; and my hopeless unbelief in that, and indeed in the whole scope of his present <hi rend="italic">sally</hi> into modern existence (as little better than one of Quixote&#x2019;s), evidently gives him pain. We differ, so far as I can yet compute, from the very centre. His aim is, it would seem, to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> something, and become a universal blessing thereby; my fixed long-growing conviction is that a man had better not attempt to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> anything, but struggle with the whole soul of him to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> something; on <pb id="pg-14-231" n="14:231"/>&#x201C;vegetable diet,&#x201D; or what diet and conditions soever he can suitabliest come at, and make safe truce and <supplied>[avowed?]</supplied><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word illegible; Slater reads &#x201C;armed.&#x201D;</note> neutrality with the world by means of: there, having cleared a little free space for himself, let him <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, in God&#x2019;s name, say I: there let him live on vegetables, and <hi rend="italic">be</hi> happy and godlike, says Brownson;&#x2014;an enterprise terribly infested with latent Demons (vanity &#x26;c), and in brief, as I believe, <hi rend="italic">in</hi>competent to Adam&#x2019;s children in this Earth!

<ps><p>Mrs Alcott&#x2019;s two Letters were forwarded yesterday; not indeed to his address, for I do not know that; but to a man who lives in the close neighbourhood, &#x26; knows and will find him.</p>
<p>By far the valuablest thing that Alcot brought me was the newspaper report of Emerson&#x2019;s last Lectures in New York.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had given six of the eight lectures &#x201C;On the Times&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411206-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1841-12-06">6 Dec. 1841</date></ref>) in New York, <date when="1842-03-03">3</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-03-16">16 March</date>.

<salute>My dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>I am glad to hear of your well-being, and that you have got done with the Shirts, which is a sign of your industry. They will be well off your hands; and, I have no doubt, will be found very suitable when they arrive here. In the meanwhile I do not want them sent off yet, till there are some more things to go with them: I am in no want of them yet, and shall not I think be so till it will be about time for the meal to be sent from Scotsbrig. At all events you may look to that (for the present) as the way of sending them; and therefore keep them beside you till some chance of delivering them safe to my Mother, or another Scotsbrig party, turn up. There is no haste about them; the meal <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be ready, I suppose, till the end of <date when="1842-09-00">September</date>, if then.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile I want you to make me some flannel things too,&#x2014;three flannel shirts especially. You can get the flannel from Alick, if he have any that he can well recommend; you can readily have them made before the other shirts go off.&#x2014; I have taken the measure today, and now send you the dimensions, together with a <hi rend="italic">measuring strap</hi> which I bought some weeks ago (at one penny) for the purpose! <hi rend="italic">You are to be careful to scour the flannel first;</hi> after which process the dimensions are these:</p>
<q><p><hi rend="italic">width</hi> (when the shirt is laid on its back) 22&#xBD; inches</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">extent from wrist-button to wrist-button</hi> 61 inches*</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">length</hi> (in the back) 35 inches</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">length</hi> in the front 25&#xBD; inches.</p></q>
<p>Do you understand all that? I daresay you will make it out; and this measuring-band will enable you to be exact enough;&#x2014;only you must <pb id="pg-14-233" n="14:233"/>observe that at the beginning of it&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Hoity toity! I find that it is I myself that have made a mistake there, and that you have only to measure fair with the line; and all will be right! The dimensions as above 22&#xBD;, 61, 35, 25&#xBD;.</p>
<p>If you could make me two pairs of flannel drawers, I should like very well too; but that I am afraid will be too hard for you.</p>
<p>This is all the express work I have for you at present; neither is there any news of much moment that I could send you. Jane continues still weak, but seems to gather strength too. I keep very quiet, am very busy and stand the summer fully better than is usual with me here. John still continues in Town, and does not speak of going yet: we meet every Sunday here at dinner</p>
<p>Our good Mother&#x2014;you perhaps know, has got over to Jean for some sea-bathing, about Arbigland I think. We hope they are all well about Gill, and that a good crop is on its feet for them: give our kind regards and continual goodwishes both to Mary and Jamie, and accept them for yourself.&#x2014; Next time you write you had better tell me how your money stands out: and if at any time, my dear little Sister, I can help you in anything, be sure do not neglect to write <hi rend="italic">then</hi>. <closer><salute>Our love and best wishes to you, dear Jenny.</salute></closer></p>

<p>Thanks for your Letter; for the news of yourself, and the kind message from your Brother.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to <hi rend="italic">Fasti Ecclesiae Scoticanae</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1920-00-00">1920</date>) 3:202, Scott&#x2019;s only brother, John (b. <date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>), d. young.

Somebody asked, &#x201C;If I was working very hard?&#x201D; I had to answer, &#x201C;Idling very hard&#x201D;; which is the mournful fact. Pray come and see.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-234" n="14:234"/>Here are certain Prusso-Pusey or Anti-Pusey matters, just received, which I send to you; I have not yet read them: I only know that Marheinecke, one of the writers, is &#x201C;a considerable of a blockhead,&#x201D; as the Yankees say.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Varnhagen von Ense wrote to TC, <date when="1842-06-25">25 June</date>: &#x201C;I am &#x2026; sending you a few other sheets of our Berlin Jahrbuch, and what is more in a number of copies for optional distribution, because therein are discussed the relations between German and British theology&#x2014;relations which are of greater importance for us since in the new, ever more violent, battle between Light and Darkness, our enemies of progress would gladly strengthen themselves through English prestige; the English enemies of progress, however, as the example of Mr. Mill shows, meddle as boldly as they do illegitimately in our philosophical arguments, and agree over them without the least understanding them! It is desirable that people in England, where we count on much good consent from enlightened persons, at least be aware how attacks over here are driven off and returned.&#x201D; For Marheinecke, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410521-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1841-05-21">21 May 1841</date></ref>.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>The day before yesterday your Packet of Puritan Divinity arrived safe. Your Parcel for Knightsbridge was forthwith consigned to your Father, who happened to come in at the moment; Maurice&#x2019;s Parcel was also despatched at once, as you directed.</p>
<p>I have read Peters&#x2019;s Sermon;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hugh Peters or Peter (<date when="1598-00-00">1598</date>&#x2013;<date when="1660-00-00">1660</date>), independent divine, became minister at Salem, Mass., <date when="1635-00-00">1635</date>; returned to England, <date when="1641-00-00">1641</date>, became active in the Civil War, and was executed as a regicide. TC mentions his sermon of <date when="1647-09-18">18 Sept. 1647</date> in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:281; his pbd. sermons are <hi rend="italic">God&#x2019;s Doings and Man&#x2019;s Duty</hi> (<date when="1646-00-00">1646</date>) and <hi rend="italic">A Sermon &#x2026; Preached before his Death</hi> (<date when="1660-00-00">1660</date>).</note> the longest, most authentic utterance of his I have yet met with. Poor Hugh is not at all a fool; I find in him a very considerable fund of natural sagacity, coupled with great activity and ardour, and I do believe far more than the average sincerity, kindheartedness and general worth; I also like his drollery, or at least do not dislike it, even in the Puritan Pulpit,&#x2014;so fond am I of real fun in the heart of any mortal, almost at any time! The old Christians used to be seized with &#x201C;Easter Laughter&#x201D; (some terrible whirlwind of <hi rend="italic">guffawing</hi>, I suppose, even at that sacred time): serious men are always great laughers too on occasion.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling read this letter to Caroline Fox, who referred to this and Alcott&#x2019;s visit in her journal, <date when="1842-07-27">27 July</date> (Fox 170).</note> Was not poor Peters unlucky to lose <pb id="pg-14-235" n="14:235"/>his head! Lawrence Sterne<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1713-00-00">1713</date>&#x2013;<date when="1768-00-00">68</date>), author, humorist, and Anglican divine.</note> kept his. Time and Chance happen unto all.&#x2014; By the bye, Hugh was a Cornish man, as I discover very lately. No Biography of him, or means of getting one, is now extant on the Earth.</p>
<p>Yesterday there arrived a Packet from Varnhagen v. Ense; part of the contents were three copies of these German Shovel-hatteries one of which copies I send to you,&#x2014;for your virtues or sins. Pray read it, and if you like send it on to Hare or some other. To me the whole matter is but mournful, distressing, even offensive,&#x2014;as the gradual inevitable rotting away of carrion; with antiseptics indeed, but with ammonia and hydrogen not the less!</p>
<p>You made a real escape in the case of Brownson Alcott.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had been out when Alcott called on him in late <date when="1842-06-00">June</date>. Emerson had written to Sterling, <date when="1842-04-01">1 April</date>, that he had told TC nothing about Alcott except of his arrival, &#x201C;For I should like well to set Alcott before that sharp-eyed painter for his portrait, without prejudice of any kind&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Sterling-Emerson Correspondence</hi> 52).</note> He is a Yankee Don Quixote, who guesses that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will bring back the Saturnian Kingdoms to this forlorn Earth by a life of simplicity, and diet of vegetables. For the first two times, I got good fun out of him; for he is an ingenious, honest-hearted kind of Quixote,&#x2014;a long lean man, very like the Don even in figure, who drawls terribly, and &#x201C;guesses,&#x201D; and has a kind of rustic dignity and loveability about him: but the second time, discerning my hopeless unbelief in vegetables he expressed real affliction; and tho&#x2019; we kept him all night, and fed him with Scotch porridge, and unimaginable messes according to our best understanding, he refused to be comforted, and has not come again.&#x2014; This also is the rotting of carrion; tho&#x2019; it may be <hi rend="italic">hartshorn</hi> derived from that; a kind of ammonia without the hydrogen, or with less of it! To speak in a figure!</p>
<p>My dear Sterling, I wish to Heaven you could teach me the secret of <hi rend="italic">doing a little work</hi>; my poor right hand has altogether forgotten its cunning: and yet if I can work no more, why should I live any more! Verily it were not worth while.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>As the season here is drawing to a close, Mr Milnes and I thought good to wind up our Begg-Subscription affairs, and transmit you the amount. We have made out the sorriest pittance, as you will see by the particulars on the annexed sheet: but indeed, after the conquest of the pension, we did not think it right, in the present awful time, to press charitable people, or even to apply at all to such as were not decidedly rich  Mr Milnes took the Fashionables in his own hand,&#x2014;and truly they have not proved too exuberant upon him: I had an agent in the City, of whom I expected something; but when applied to he responded that some other party or parties had been among his friends for the same object, and in his hand there was nothing. I sent off the Amount, thirty-three pounds and sixpence, yesterday afternoon, and it will be paid, when asked for, at the British Linen Company Bank, to &#x201C;Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Chambers Esq., Athol Place,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact, 9 Atholl Crescent.</note> Edin<hi rend="italic">r:&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014;and so herewith ends my Stewardship in this piece of Benevolence. I am right glad we got the little Pension; otherwise I fear the Subscription would have been rather a lame affair.</p>
<p>Yesterday, on my way homewards, I received <hi rend="italic">another sovereign</hi>; and a certain acquaintance of mine in Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields professes to have some <hi rend="italic">three pounds</hi> and odd already in his hand, and to be able to gather a few pounds more <hi rend="italic">if he had Circulars</hi>; for which element of furtherance he long ago applied to me, but got none, my stock being out. If you have any Circulars left, pray be so kind as address half a dozen to that worthy man: &#x201C;John Forster Esq, 58. Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields&#x201D;: the result of his labours together with this new sovereign of mine, and any other dripping that may fall into my dish, shall shortly in some good way be transmitted to you.&#x2014; Much more money might be gathered if one became pressing: indeed there has been properly no <hi rend="italic">pressure</hi> here at all; Peel having once yielded, the matter elsewhere was left very much to take its course.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For details of the pension, see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420607-TC-IBE-01">TC to <sic>IB</sic><corr>IBE</corr>, <date when="1842-06-07">7 June</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>We are all much pleased with the figure Miss Begg makes in these transactions: her Letters are full of modest sense and propriety; one asks along with you Whether no better task than sewing clothes at Tranent could be discovered for her? You, if you see a possibility will not fail to lay hold of it for the poor girl. In the meanwhile, I suppose she is <hi rend="italic">safe</hi> at Tranent, and not unhappy;&#x2014;rather well off, one may say, <pb id="pg-14-237" n="14:237"/>as welfare goes in this world. I reckon it one of the best features of this Begg business that your conquest for them is not one that lifts them out of their old state at all; but simply renders soft and light for them a set of conditions they were from the first used to. You have seen Isabella Begg, and can judge her and her circumstances and capabilities: we will leave you to do you<supplied>[r]</supplied> wisest and kindest.</p>
<p>And so <foreign>adieu</foreign>, my dear Sir; and thanks to you in the name of all good Scotchmen and men: and according to the old Proverb, May ne&#x2019;er worse be among us!</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your Letter from the Galloway Coast arrived yesterday. I am very glad to fancy my Mother and you there; I hope it will do you all good, young and old.&#x2014; But you must endeavour to get <hi rend="italic">butter</hi>, or it will never do! These bathing-quarters are apt to prove a rude kind of shop; as we too found, last year, at Newby in many ways. For three days, I remember, there appeared no possibility of getting <hi rend="italic">milk</hi>, unless we took to stealing it or begging it. But one has always the benefit of right clear air, and a swash in the ever-pure waters of the ancient Sea. The Shore where you now are is very pleasant too, if your weather prove any way tolerable. Here we have it of a most uncertain kind; little rain comparatively; but the most capricious changes of wind, and consequent alternations between hot and cold. Jane has a fire lighted sometimes in the morning, then at noon we are all roasting, and midnight again will be cold, almost frosty. There has never been any right fierce heat since <date when="1842-06-00">June</date>; from which alone I conclude, in opposition to all sorts of clatter, that the general harvest <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be first-rate. They are all busy sheaving hereabouts; the grain, I understand, is good, but rather little of it on the ground. The general famine of Britain will evidently not be cured by <hi rend="italic">our</hi> harvest: it is greatly to be dreaded there will be rioting and massacre before winter pass; and the infatuated Landlords will have to <pb id="pg-14-239" n="14:239"/>abrogate their Corn-Law, perhaps in greater haste than will suit them well! From your meal-mob in Dumfries<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420701-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1842-07-01">1 July</date></ref>.</note> you may judge what a general meal-mob over Lancashire, Yorkshire and so many other shires would be.</p>
<p>I read your little Methodist Tract,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> and will return it when you get back to Dumfries. A considerable Packet of Books had already gone; must about this time have got to James: a very miscellaneous set of works; some of them are for James himself and you; one for Mother; some for Scotsbrig,&#x2014;a considerable set, mostly rubbish, for the Ecclefechan Library. James will have his own adoes to get them all sorted and despatched.</p>
<p>My work remains <hi rend="italic">dormant</hi>, sleeping the <hi rend="italic">uneasiest</hi> sleep. I follow to the Letter my own precept, &#x201C;Hasten <hi rend="italic">slowly</hi>&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in the Latin tag &#x201C;<foreign>festina lente</foreign>&#x201D; or &#x201C;<foreign>ohne hast</foreign>&#x201D; from Goethe&#x2019;s poem; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310610-TC-G-01"><sic>5:287</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1831-06-10">10 June 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;but it will not always be so; it must alter, and shall. For the rest, I keep much within doors, am very silent and quiet. Good, above all things, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">to work ay mostly in a place by himsel&#x2019;!</hi>&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380121-TC-MAC-01"><sic>10:9</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1838-01-21">21 Jan. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Jane has about bargained to go out and pass a week or two with Mrs Buller in Suffolk, in a quiet country place, some seventy miles to the North-east of this. I warmly second the motion; judging cer<supplied>[tainly]</supplied> that it will do her good. Probably I myself may go up into that quarter and fetch her home. &#x201C;Cousin Jeannie,&#x201D; I suppose, will return to Liverpool: she is a most quiet, cheery little creature; content in any situation.</p>
<p>Jack, as usual, was here the day before yesterday: they are not speaking of leaving London yet; he has got his cash paid up now, has bought &#x201C;Exchequer Bills&#x201D; with it; he is always in good health, heart and spirits; smokes a cigar, beside me with my pipe, and describes with great heartiness what he has been doing thro&#x2019; the week. &#x201C;Poor fellow, after all!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Emerson the American has sent me another &#xa3;50 from my Book-sales in his country: I always receive such monies like <hi rend="italic">manna</hi> dropt out of the skies. His Grace of Buccleuch has never yet paid me, nor said that he will, nor even that he will not! I too maintain the most absolute silence on the subject; thanking God that such a capricious <hi rend="italic">haddock</hi> is not &#x201C;the breath of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> nostrils,&#x201D; as poor Sir W. Scott found a Duke to be.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 2:7; Sir Walter Scott was notoriously respectful to the leading aristocracy.</note> Let him take his own way of it, the most illustrious <pb id="pg-14-240" n="14:240"/>Duke.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Now you must be sure <supplied>[of one]</supplied> thing, dear Jean: to take care of our Mother in that rude <supplied>[place]</supplied>,&#x2014;for one very especial thing, to see decidedly that</p>

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>By the Catalogue of the London Library, I find there is a certain Philip Harwood who published <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Strauss</hi>, our edition of which is dated <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; I think he is a sort of Substitute or Successor of the Unitarian Fox, and writes Straussisms occasionally still in the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review:</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philip Harwood (<sic><date when="1809-00-00">1809</date></sic><corr><date when="1811-00-00">1811</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1887-00-00">87</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12542"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), journalist; studied at Edinburgh, where Thomas Chalmers&#x2019; lectures unintentionally converted him to unitarianism; unitarian minister, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>; became an asst. to W. J. Fox, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; successively sub-ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner, Spectator</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>. His book was <hi rend="italic">German Anti-Supernaturalism: Six Lectures on Strauss&#x2019;s &#x201C;Life of Jesus&#x201D;</hi> (<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), i.e., David Friedrich Strauss. His most recent contribution to the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> was &#x201C;Subscription: the Thirty-nine Articles&#x201D; 38 (<date when="1842-07-00">July</date>): 1&#x2013;32.</note> unless this be your man, I cannot guess farther, being much a stranger in that Strauss department: but if you bid me, I will cheerfully inquire till I do learn. I think Harwood must be he.&#x2014; Marheinecke is not such a blockhead here as his <hi rend="italic">Leben Luther</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Life of Luther</hi>] had led me to expect.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420723-TC-AJS-01">TC to AJS, <date when="1842-07-23">23 July</date></ref>. Marheinecke&#x2019;s work was possibly <hi rend="italic">Einleitung in die &#xF6;ffentlichen Vorlesungen &#xfc;ber die Bedeutung der Hegelschen Philosophie in der christlichen Theologie</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>).</note> The Prussians, apparently, will not adopt the Anglican Shovel-hat;&#x2014;heartily welcome for me! I read, the other day, half an hour in <hi rend="italic">Gladstone</hi>;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Ewart Gladstone. Probably his <hi rend="italic">The State in its Relations with the Church</hi> (<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390208-TC-RWE-01"><sic>11:26</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1839-02-08">8 Feb. 1839</date></corr></ref>), perhaps in the enlarged 2-vol. edn. (<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), or <hi rend="italic">Church Principles Considered in their Results</hi> (<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>).</note> a most methodic, fairspoken, purified, clear-starched, <hi rend="italic">sincere-looking</hi> man. How the human Soul <hi rend="italic">can</hi> swathe itself, in formula within formula, like a very Egyptian Mummy, and still flatter itself that it is alive,&#x2014;nay <hi rend="italic">be</hi> alive, for commercial and some other purposes! It is to me a rather melancholy spectacle; in which, however, I discern great benefit too.</p>
<p>Bancroft&#x2019;s Book does not please me much, tho&#x2019; there are good fragments in it:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly George Bancroft, <hi rend="italic">A History of the United States</hi> (Boston, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>). Bancroft had sent TC vols. 1 and 2 in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380613-TC-GBA-01"><sic>10:100</sic><corr>TC to GBA, <date when="1838-06-13">13 June 1838</date></corr></ref>. TC could also have borrowed vol.3 (3d edn.; Boston, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>) from the London Library.</note> his Puritanism is but a kind of <hi rend="italic">Pusey</hi> Puritanism;&#x2014;alas, we are all got into Puseyism, Dilettantism, each after his sort, and fancy it a great thing if we can believe that men were men at one time, and <pb id="pg-14-241" n="14:241"/>looked rather handsome in that unexpected character! The Yankees, in addition to all, are dreadfully <hi rend="italic">lengthy</hi>, and do not in the least understand where they are <hi rend="italic">boring</hi> one; a most inconvenient fault.</p>
<p>Alcot came to me again the other day; little Paracelsus Browning, a dainty Leigh-Huntish kind of fellow,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Browning, author of <hi rend="italic">Paracelsus</hi> (<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>); see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360412-TC-JOST-01"><sic>8:332&#x2013;33</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1836-04-12">12 April 1836</date></corr></ref>. TC often compared Browning with Leigh Hunt (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14195"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); cf. Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CF</hi> 162.</note> with much ingenuity, vivacity and Cokney gracefulness, happened to be here; and answered his solemn drawling recommendations of vegetable diet with light Cockney banter and logic; whereupon Alcot, at parting, told me &#x201C;he would never come to me again!&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alcott wrote to his wife, <date when="1842-08-02">2 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I have &#x2026; seen &#x2026; Carlyle again, <hi rend="italic">but we quarrelled outright</hi>, and I shall see him not again. Greatness abides not here: her home is in the Clouds, save when she descends on the meadows or treads the groves&#x2014;of Concordia&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Letters of Alcott</hi>, ed. R. L. Herrnstadt 88). To a friend Browning wrote, in a letter misdated <date when="1842-09-31">31 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Carlyle I saw some weeks since: a crazy or sound asleep&#x2014;not dreaming&#x2014;American was with him&#x2014;a special friend of Emerson&#x2019;s&#x2014;and talked! I have since heard, to my solace, that my outrageous laughters have made him ponder seriously of the hopelessness of England&#x2014;which he would convert to something or other&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Robert Browning and Alfred Domett</hi>, ed.

<p>Last night I saw Stephen Spring Rice,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stephen Edmund Spring Rice (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>), eldest son of Lord Monteagle; left Cambridge without a degree to be private sec. to his father when he was chancellor of the exchequer, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>; m., <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, Ellen Mary, b.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>A certain wild Gallician Pole, of the name of Dr Lotsky,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John or Johann Lhotsky (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>?), explorer-naturalist in Brazil, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">32</date>, and Australia, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">38</date>; lived in London, ca. <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>; author of <hi rend="italic">A Journey from Sydney to the Australian Alps &#x2026; in &#x2026; <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date></hi> (Sydney, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>) and political pamphlets in London, including <hi rend="italic">Hunger and Revolution</hi> (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>). See <hi rend="italic">Australian Dictionary of Biography</hi> and V. Kruta et al., <hi rend="italic">Dr. John Lhotsky: The Turbulent Australian Writer, Naturalist, and Explorer</hi> (Melbourne, <date when="1977-00-00">1977</date>).</note> who &#x201C;knows nine languages,&#x201D; who has &#x201C;given his name to a botanical genus,&#x201D; who has travelled over South America, and done I know not what other heroic feats,&#x2014;keeps buzzing about me, thro&#x2019; the Penny Post, in these days, expressing the extremest ardour to be employed in some kind of Foreign Reviewing. I have seen the man only twice, for <hi rend="italic">a second</hi> each time, and know next to nothing of him; in fact, literally nothing, except his physiognomy, and the report of Mazzini, neither of which rises to the epic pitch, tho&#x2019; both do seem to promise some possibility if one rightly knew what! As the shortest way, I have decided on sending him to you, that your own eyes may see: you can listen to the man, decide whether he is worth a trial, and on what you can try him.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, of which Forster was ed. Two of his articles had already been pbd. there, <date when="1842-01-00">Jan.</date> and <date when="1842-07-00">July 1842</date>. Forster apparently did not use him further.</note> <pb id="pg-14-243" n="14:243"/>I believe he does understand those &#x201C;nine languages&#x201D; of his in some tolerable measure; he writes copious and not very incorrect English; has boundless activity; the greatest faculty in searching thro&#x2019; Book-collections, making <foreign><hi rend="italic">Catalogues Raisonn&#xE9;es</hi></foreign> &#x26;c, &#x26;c; some knowledge, and the liveliest smattering of all kinds of knowledge; the basis of him I take to be a transcendent goodhumoured <hi rend="italic">vanity</hi>,&#x2014;I wish there were a milder word, for really it is on many sides a praiseworthy quality, that of his, and has kept him warm and happy within, many a rough cold year, when there was nothing without but nakedness, hunger and blank desolate despair! Look in those large glaring blue eyes of his, on the indomitable weatherworn Sermatic<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;Sarmatic.&#x201D;</note> countenance, the kind of cynic dignity, reduced gentlemanhood, and hope springing eternal in the Hyperborean breast; and see whether &#x201C;everlasting No&#x201D; is the only answer he must get! It seems to me, in the hands of an adroit Editor, something might be got of him. He is ready for all and any work; straining fiercely at the leash, ready to fly, hunt and devour. Poor Lotsky!&#x2014; Do you not publish &#x201C;short Notices of Books&#x201D;; &#x201C;Scientific intelligence&#x201D;; at all events, every half-year an Index? Lotsky will work like a lion; I do believe in some measure, faithfully and cheap.</p>
<p>For the present he has taken up some hint I gave Mazzini once of writing an Article on one Mi&#x26;ccedil;kiewitz (Miskiewitz they call it);<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adam Mickiewicz (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), poet and revolutionary; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400206-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:37&#x2013;38</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-06">6 Feb. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> a modern Polish Poet, whom I know by some French Translations, to be a man of real poetic talent, by far the chief Sarmat I have yet got eye on; a man surely well worth being made known to the English: but whether Lotsky is the hand for that? He will propose to &#x201C;write a specimen,&#x201D; I fancy. Perhaps he has some English printed stuff; for he does already write extensively in <hi rend="italic">Useful Knowledge</hi> &#x26;c,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the pubs. of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300320-TC-JPE-01"><sic>5:84</sic><corr>TC to JPE, <date when="1830-03-20">20 March 1830</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390204-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:17</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-02-04">4 Feb. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> if I mistake not: this let him exhibit to you. Say <hi rend="small-caps">no</hi>, if you must say it, mildly but decisively with an air of <hi rend="italic">finality</hi>,&#x2014;and forgive me for my sin in the business, which really I could not help!&#x2014;</p>
<p>May I send Lotsky then on Saturday at 3 o&#x2019;clock? To put him out of pain I will do that straightway. If you do not like him at that hour, pray, in the name of reduced gentlemanship and the genius of nine languages, name him another. I enclose his last Letter, received half an hour ago, where his address is. I should say, it is much the worst written of all his missives; but Chance will that this is the one you are to see.</p>
<p><closer><salute><pb id="pg-14-244" n="14:244"/><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Forster.&#x2014; I wrote to Chambers to send you half a dozen Begg Circulars; mine are all out long since. What spoil you can achieve with these will go in a sum by itself.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I have owed you a little Note in return for yours, these two weeks or more; and now I will pay it before setting out on my travels today. Perhaps you did not open the last Letter that came from me for my Mother; in that case it is longer than usual since you heard news of us.</p>
<p>Our news indeed are not very considerable; nothing properly <hi rend="italic">new</hi>. I continue very quiet; and, tho&#x2019; shewing nothing as yet <hi rend="italic">above ground</hi>, perhaps not altogether idle. I say sometimes, all good work has a considerable portion of it <hi rend="italic">sunk</hi>, known only to the worker! It is <supplied>[    ]</supplied>-count, be it <supplied>[    ]</supplied> time it is none of the <supplied>[    ]</supplied> this <hi rend="italic">sunk</hi> stage: one grows <supplied>[    ]</supplied>-thing shews itself above ground, that all goes down as into a bottomless quagmire; one thinks sometimes that nothing <hi rend="italic">ever will</hi> come of it! I have fears of that kind now and then; but, on the whole, must plunge along.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Poor Jane continues still very weakly; very disconsolate for the loss of her Mother. Yet she is recovering slowly. Mrs Buller has bargained to have her out, in a week or two, into their place in Suffolk (North-east from this about 70 miles); Jane has consented to go; and this, I think, will do her some good. The little Cousin from Liverpool, who is a very cheerful quiet good little damsel, is still here; but I suppose may be for homewards when Jane goes off,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I know not that either, for she seems to like this much better than Liverpool. Jack comes always down on Sundays; sometimes, for <supplied>[    ]</supplied>age, som <supplied>[    ]</supplied>avours to <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> him <supplied>[    ]</supplied> possible.</p>
<p><supplied>[    ]</supplied> Jean I learn that our Mother and she have got into some sea-quarters about Arbigland: I begin to fear the weather will be too cold. Here our Summer season seems decidedly on the wane; our greatest heat past: on Wednesday night and yesterday (Thursday) morning, we had a terrible explosion of thunder and rain, followed by bright <pb id="pg-14-245" n="14:245"/>sunshine which was very beautiful; but today there is dim loud N.W. wind, and decidedly cold temperature. I think it plainly impossible that the Harvest in this end of the Island can be <hi rend="italic">good:</hi> indeed I hear now, in spite of all the bragging about it, &#x201C;That the crop is good <hi rend="italic">in quality</hi>, but too thin on the ground!&#x201D; It is a frightful prospect of a winter for millions of men. No day would it surprise one to hear that they had <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> patience, and begun rioting and reaving,&#x2014;begun secret fire-raising at least, which I suppose is the likeliest thing. Some say your Scotch harvest is better than ours comparatively; I sincerely <supplied>[    ]</supplied>-ticular. In<supplied>[    ]</supplied> we are hardly yet <supplied>[    ]</supplied> Dumfries I see they are <supplied>[    ]</supplied> season there. Farmers and all people <supplied>[    ]</supplied>-ficulties; but yet I rather calculate you at Scotsbrig have a lighter cast of it than many: at all events, I always calculate on James of Scotsbrig&#x2019;s with cheerful resolution and an energetic silence, which I honour greatly in him! It lightens his burden much, at least steadies his back for bearing it; the like is worthy of honour in all men.</p>
<p>Dear Jamie, I wish you would take pen again, and tell me minutely all your buyings and sellings, your outlooks and doings,&#x2014;in short give me a picture of Scotsbrig. Poor Isabella I fear is still weakly: has she ever yet tried the Shower-bath? I splash myself daily the first thing I do after rising. I feel convinced it would do her good.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I wrote to Jenny the other day about 3 new flannel shirts I want; of which Alick, I hope, will have good means of supplying the material. She will write or apply to him I suppose.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Jamie. My brotherly love and wishes to one and all of you. Yours ever,</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Here is Chambers&#x2019;s Letter in answer to our cash. I forward it chiefly because there seems yet to be no tidings of the Fifty-pound Donation; and a horrible suspicion crosses me that the illustrious Premier may have forgotten it! Pray do you in some good way, act as flapper on him;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels</hi>, &#x201C;A Voyage to Laputa&#x201D; ch. 2.</note> bring it again into his high head,&#x2014;and dismiss it not altogether out of your own, till Chambers answer that he actually has and holds it!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-14-246" n="14:246"/>Did you see the Yankee Alcot in search of a man? He eagerly grasped at my proposal to let him have a fly at you.

Have you in your life seen any nobler Speciman? The Art of <hi rend="italic">boring</hi> must surely be carried to the borders of the Infinite in the New Country! It is positively frightful. This Alcot, the last time he saw me, found Browning here, who quizzed him, at least who did not in the least admire either him or his vegetable Diet, or his Dial or his New Ideas;&#x2014;whereupon Alcot parted in almost open wrath; and to my question, When shall I see you again? answered with piercing emphasis, with both mouth and nose, &#x201C;Never, I guess!&#x201D;&#x2014; Ought not the Archbishop to introduce into his Liturgy <supplied>[in]</supplied> these times, the new words, From Yankee bores, Good Lord &#x26;c?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the Litany the formula for the petition is &#x201C;From &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;, Good Lord deliver us.&#x201D;</note> If it would have the slightest imaginable effect!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are all empty since you went away; even Darwin departed this morning. It is a quiet as of an empty slaughterhouse; but still it is quiet. <foreign>Ay de mi!</foreign></p>
<p>Well, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> did a right proper thing this session, one at least: you got this pension for the poor old Sister of a Burns.

<salute>Dear Spedding</salute>
<p>I here inclose for your behoof certain fragments of New-England Philosophy, in the shape of Reports, by a Yankee Editor, of some late Lectures of friend Emerson&#x2019;s.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420719-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1842-07-19">19 July</date></ref>.</note> I know not if you are at all acquainted with friend Emerson: I do not recommend him to you as a great man, who has new illumination for this benighted Universe; but as a notable <pb id="pg-14-247" n="14:247"/>man, at least as a noticeable man, not without a kind of illumination for himself and a few others. The New-Englanders are a <hi rend="italic">rustic</hi> people, of simple conditions compared with ours: these Emersonians, I find, having got to see that man in very truth has a soul, and even a religion independent of Socinianism and the Shovel-hat, are forthwith threatening to constitute themselves into some melancholy crotchet of a <hi rend="italic">Sect,</hi> with all the poor perversions of a Sect; the chief tenet, as I understand, being that man ought to live on vegetables, earn therefore his food by three hours daily labour, and live simple and <hi rend="italic">be</hi> beautiful under the sky! Emerson, I hear, still hovers on the edge; but several of his disciples have already gone in, and welter there neck and heels. A man named Alcot is come over in these very days for proselytes;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They included James Pierrepont Greaves, John Howard, Charles Lane, and Henry Wright, who had founded Alcott House. Wright, Lane and his son William returned with Alcott, and Lane invested all his savings of $2,000 in the ill-fated Fruitlands; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420719-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1842-07-19">19 July</date></ref>.</note> has already parted in downright wrath with me, because I defended myself with quizzing; and is on the whole one of the strangest Potatoe Quixotes I ever fell in with. An elderly long thin man, with small irritable chin, with grey worn temples, mild sorrowful intelligent eyes, and the completest faith in man&#x2019;s salvation by vegetables; loveable, yet on the whole a frightful bore. The young Socinian Ministry, he tells me, are all quitting their pulpits in New England; taking to the fields and farms;&#x2014;as indeed they may well do, Socinianism being now palpably a ghost. We live generally &#x201C;in the twelfth hour of the night.&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>You are surely correct in what you say of Stomach-Philosophy, That the great mass of men have in all times guided themselves forward by it and by little else. Nay even the chosen few, if not in a state of spasmodic antagonism, an undesirable state, have always had to mind it very constantly withal&#x2014;to admit the entirely undeniable fact that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> had bodies, &#x26;c, and that the great majority of neighbours had nothing else! This is true; and yet when the great majority becomes as it were the entire mass of society, to which in highest Cathedrals or elsewhere you shall vainly look for an exception, we have frightful times of it. These same <hi rend="italic">few</hi> have ever been as the salt of the earth; and if the salt have lost its savour, if there be no more salt&#x2014;? No society that I ever heard of, Roman, Arab, Christian, Chinese, could subsist on Cant and Benthamism, never so cunningly blended; but had either to get new ways of believing, the initiatory of new ways of acting, or else to rush down into nameless wreck and putrefaction. The Englishman believes that he has <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with his fellow creature, when he has paid him his money wages; he asks Cain-like, Am I my brother&#x2019;s keeper? and thinks <pb id="pg-14-248" n="14:248"/>it much if he subscribe to some soup-kitchen. Nimrod Apperton (if that is his name) writes and prints lately in Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles James Apperley (<sic><date when="1779-00-00">1779</date></sic><corr><date when="1778-00-00">1778</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>; <ref target="volume-14/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/594"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), sporting writer known as &#x201C;Nimrod.&#x201D; &#x201C;My Life and Times.
