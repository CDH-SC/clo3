<p>Volume 41 of <hi rend="italic">The Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi> covers the period from <date when="1864-09-00">September 1864</date> to <date when="1865-04-00">April 1865</date> and is dominated by completion and publication of Thomas Carlyle&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> and by the continued concerns for Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x02019;s health. Of the 215 letters in this volume there are 20 written from TC to JWC in <date when="186-09-00">September</date> and 20 from JWC to TC also in September, the only time in this volume they were apart.</p>
<p>When he published his <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>, TC little expected to be expressing the same sentiments almost 30 years later on approaching the end of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>. TC wrote to his brother John A. Carlyle, <date when="1836-10-00">20 Oct. 1836</date>: &#x0201c;Thou seest I am to <hi rend="italic">have done</hi> with this sorrowful Enterprise of a Book, with France and Revolutions forevermore&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-09/lt-18361020-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:79</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1836-10-20">20 Oct. 1836</date></corr></ref>), and to Ralph Waldo Emerson, <date when="1836-11-05">5 Nov. 1836</date>: &#x0201c;I am as it were within sight of land. In two months more, this unblessed Book will be <hi rend="italic">finished</hi>&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-09/lt-18361105-TC-RWE-01"><sic>9:81</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1836-11-05">5 Nov. 1836</date></corr></ref>). In <date when="1864-12-00">December 1864</date> he wrote to brother John: &#x0201c;My work is going on; but under endless haggles from toothache, from Printers, from mud, dyspepsia, dispirit<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c: I seem to myself nearly &#x02018;over with <hi rend="italic">it</hi>&#x02019; in more senses than one!&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641202-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1864-12-02">2 Dec. 1864</date></ref>), and to Henry Inglis: &#x0201c;In january coming &#x02026; I hope to have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with a certain Book, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has almost literally killed me,&#x02014;at least it has kept me buried alive for 12 years past; and I am quite <hi rend="italic">killt</hi> as the Irish say, and hardly worth resuscitating&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641207-TC-HI-01">TC to HI, <date when="1864-12-07">7 Dec. 1864</date></ref>). Later in the month he wrote to sister Jean Carlyle Aitken that he &#x0201c;dare promise nothing; every page has been full of <hi rend="italic">fash</hi> &#x26;toil &#x26;disgusting <hi rend="italic">fikeries</hi> in this dreadful book. &#x02026; Courage, Courage! Having eaten the cow, who w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> weary on the rump!&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641220-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1864-12-20">20 Dec. 1864</date></ref>). The almost 30 years between the two works had not led to TC feeling any more sanguine about the process.</p>
 <p>The reviews of these two works, however, were very different. To his mother in <date when="1837-01-00">January 1837</date>, TC wrote of the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>: &#x0201c;[a]s to the reception the Book is to meet with, I judge that there will [be] ten enemies of it for one friend; but also that it will find friends by and by; in fine, that, as brave old Johnson said, &#x02018;useful diligence will at last prevail&#x02019;&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-09/lt-18370122-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:125</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1837-01-22">22 Jan. 1837</date></corr></ref>). TC judged correctly for the reviewer of <hi rend="italic">French Revolution, Times</hi>, <date when="1837-08-03">3 Aug. 1837</date>, wrote: &#x0201c;Since the appearance of this work, within the last two months, it has raised among the critics and the reading public a strange storm of applause and discontent. To hear one party you would fancy that the author was but a dull madman, indulging in wild vagaries of language and dispensing with common sense <pb id="pg-41-xii" n="41:xii"/>and reason, while, according to another, his opinions are little short of inspiration, and his eloquence unbounded as his genius. &#x02026; [N]ever did a book sin so grievously from outward appearance, or a man&#x02019;s style so mar his subject and dim his genius. It is stiff, short, and rugged, it abounds with Germanisms and Latinisms, strange epithets, and choking double words, astonishing to the admirers of simple Addisonian English, to those who love history as it gracefully runs in Hume, or struts pompously in Gibbon&#x02014;no such style is Mr. Carlyle&#x02019;s.&#x0201d; Meanwhile Lady Sydney Morgan in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> wrote: &#x0201c;it is one thing to put forth a few pages of quaintness, neologism, and a whimsical coxcombry; and another, to carry such questionable qualities through three long volumes of misplaced persiflage and flippant pseudo-philosophy.&#x0201d; Later in the review she relented and admitted that &#x0201c;amidst an all-pervading absurdity of mannerism, there are passages of great power&#x0201d; (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1837-05-20">20 May 1837</date>).</p>
<p>We can contrast these with the reviews he received on the publication of the final volumes of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>. The reading public had obviously become used to TC&#x02019;s manner of writing. TC, however, had no faith in his potential readership. Writing to John Forster, thanking him for his &#x0201c;very kind and very welcome Letter,&#x0201d; he continued: &#x0201c;if all readers were possessed of the sense and patient candour of Forster, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> thing to write big Books! But they (i.e. readers) by no means are; on the contrary they are a miscellany of blockheads by the hundred and of Forsters by the decimal part of a unit&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18650329-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1865-03-29">29 March 1865</date></ref>). He must, therefore, have felt pleasantly surprised and gratified when the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reviewer wrote: &#x0201c;Mr. Carlyle has at length reached the conclusion of his great work, and may repose on his laurels. The great soldier of the 18th century is indebted to him for the best conceivable history of his military exploits and his domestic administration&#x0201d; (<date when="1865-04-18">18 April 1865</date>). The review in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> was effusive in its praise: &#x0201c;Mr. Carlyle&#x02019;s long and laborious work has come to a close; he ends it with thankfulness, and an adieu to both &#x02018;good&#x02019; and &#x02018;bad readers.&#x02019; Like all biographers, he loves his hero; unlike some, he adores his hero, in his heart, as one who does not belong to the heap of Shams, by which the candid author of these volumes fancies the world is oppressed. This love and admiration, however, are so honestly held and sincerely maintained, that one cannot but respect the man who entertains such feelings. &#x02026; In the record of this tremendous struggle [the Seven Years&#x02019; War] Mr. Carlyle has surpassed himself. His research, his judgment, his peculiar powers, his comprehensiveness, his grandeur and his &#x02018;burlesque&#x02019; of history were never more conspicuous than in this portion of his work. The war is told at very great length, the author himself seems to delight in his labour, the reader never tires of the successions of light and shade, and Mr. Carlyle himself almost appears to be joking when, at the close of the narrative, he exclaims, &#x02018;Oh, readers, do not at least you and I thank God to have now done with it!&#x02019;&#x0201d; (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1865-03-25">25 March 1865</date>). While TC and his closer friends might <pb id="pg-41-xiii" n="41:xiii"/>have smiled wryly at some of this review, it still provides a pleasing summary of TC&#x02019;s achievement.</p>
<p>TC was indeed glad to be done with it. His immediate reaction on finishing was relief. He wrote to John Forster at the beginning of March: &#x0201c;Never in my life was I so sordidly indolent, so content to be so. &#x02026; I have been buried alive, these 12 years &#x02026; have had such a fill of disgusting labours, mostly unprofitable, as has completely satisfied my appetite in that kind for all time coming&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18650306-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1865-03-06">6 March 1865</date></ref>). Of course, after so many years of toil, this sentiment was not to last. TC was suddenly at a loose end. &#x0201c;A gloomy but quiet <hi rend="italic">collapse</hi>&#x0201d; descended upon him &#x0201c;in mind and in body;&#x02014;a world left very <hi rend="italic">vacant</hi> in comparison&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18650301-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1865-03-01">1 March 1865</date></ref>). Writing again to his brother John, three weeks later, he told him: &#x0201c;[I]f a man cannot escape dyspeptic wretchedness by any mode of eating, nor count on sleep as the close of his day&#x02019;s laborious <hi rend="italic">toil</hi> (in the grateful task of <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> nothing &#x26;enjoying nothing,&#x02014;except slightly a little tobacco),&#x02014;what is to become of him&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18650320-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1865-03-20">20 March 1865</date></ref>). To his sister Jean he wrote that riding &#x0201c;is the one <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> act I do in the 24 hours; the rest of my time I am grieved to say is one tract of idleness, waste laziness, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is shameful to think of!&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18650318-TC-JAC-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1865-03-18">18 March 1865</date></ref>). His enforced idleness did not make him happy. A few weeks later he wrote: &#x0201c;My spirits vary; generally verging towards <hi rend="italic">nadir</hi>,&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">best</hi> when I am left quietest&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18650412-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1865-04-12">12 April 1865</date></ref>). Geraldine Jewsbury wrote to Walter Mantell in New Zealand, <date when="1865-03-24">24 March 1865</date>, to tell him that TC had finished <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, and &#x0201c;his wife who ought to know declares that he has been kicking up his heels in a wonderful way ever since&#x0201d; (Mantell). This was not to last and in a undated later letter (probably spring <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>), she wrote that: &#x0201c;[h]e is trying to take his ease and finds it difficult&#x02014;he is just now&#x02014;what a mere mortal w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be called &#x02018;cross&#x02019; <hi rend="italic">very</hi> cross&#x02014;but as he is a hero &#x26;a demi-god I suppose the proper formula w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be that he sees keenly &#x26;feels acutely the unsatisfactory nature of all human and domestic sayings &#x26;doings and he expresses his sentiment very forcibly&#x0201d; (Mantell).</p>
<p>The answer, as it was in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>, was to journey to Scotland. He had last spent any length of time in Dumfriesshire in <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date> and the urge to go north was very strong. Writing from Seaforth Lodge, Seaton, to his sister Jean, he told her &#x0201c;I look forward to Scotland were the Spring tempests done. Ah me, I am often very sad, if that c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> help me at all!&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18650318-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1865-03-18">18 March 1865</date></ref>). His intention was to spend some length of time there, arriving about the middle of May, and towards the end of April, he was making arrangements to send his horse, Noggs, by train to his brother James at Scotsbrig (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18650426-TC-JC-01">TC to JC, <date when="1865-04-26">26 April 1865</date></ref>). The Carlyles always needed time apart, particularly it seems when TC had time on his hands. JWC wrote to Mary Russell in <date when="1865-04-00">April</date> at this extremely trying time: &#x0201c;It is very extraordinary that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle <hi rend="italic">will</hi> hang on here always declaring himself &#x02018;going in a few days,&#x02019; when <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is what he has been saying <pb id="pg-41-xiv" n="41:xiv"/>for the last six weeks! I am kept in a perpetual meditation of Flight (<hi rend="italic">his</hi> flight) and get no good of the <hi rend="italic">present</hi>&#x02014;everything having to be postponed till he is gone&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18650415-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1865-04-15">15 April 1865</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>Returning to the beginning of this volume, although JWC&#x02019;s health continued to fluctuate, she enjoyed a very much better autumn and winter. She told her Aunt Ann at the end of November: &#x0201c;the <hi rend="italic">comparitive</hi> freedom from physical suffering, seems, after the long tortures I endured, positive enjoyment&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641130-JWC-AW-01">JWC to AW, [<date when="1864-11-30">30 Nov. 1864</date>]</ref>). She continued to suffer from the &#x0201c;irritation&#x0201d; telling TC that &#x0201c;[t]he few weeks of relief from that maddening irritation had made it like a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> and worse horror when it returned&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18640912-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-09-12">12 Sept. 1864</date>]</ref>). It was &#x0201c;bad enough to spoil all comfort in the present and to keep me in dread of worse&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18640919-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-09-19">19 Sept. 1864</date>]</ref>); in December it was still causing her <hi rend="italic">&#x0201c;special misery</hi>&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641221-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to MCA, <date when="1864-12-21">21 Dec. 1864</date></ref>).</p>
<p>Arriving back from Scotland at the end of September she was greeted ecstatically by TC and her servants and then had visits from Thomas Woolner, George Cooke, John Forster, and Lord Houghton (Richard Monckton Milnes), who all, as she wrote to TC&#x02019;s sister Mary, &#x0201c;take me in their arms &#x02026; and kiss me and&#x02014;burst into tears!! or are struck speechless&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641009-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to MCA, [<date when="1864-10-09">9 Sept. 1864</date>]</ref>). She had indeed made a remarkable recovery and wrote to Mary Russell to tell her of all her visitors: &#x0201c;[i]t is a wonder I have not been knocked up by the heaps of people who come and make such rejoicings over me as if I were a queen bee!&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641017-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1864-10-17">17 Oct.</date>]</ref>). Thomas Woolner was &#x0201c;especially <hi rend="italic">trying</hi>! for he dropt on his knees beside my sofa, and kissed me over and over, with a most stupendous beard! and a face wet with tears! I had seen him last on newyears evening, in my bed <hi rend="small-caps">dying</hi> as I thought!&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641024-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1864-10-24">24 Oct. 1864</date>]</ref>). It was only now that she realized how very worried TC had been about her and described to his sister Mary how he was &#x0201c;gentle and good&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;studies my comfort and peace as he never did before&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641018-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to MCA, [<date when="1864-10-18">18 Oct. 1864</date>]</ref>). In September he expressed his need for her and wrote &#x0201c;Oh my own Jeannie, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> you but get well to me! I am old, worn-out and weak&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18640914-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-09-14">14 Sept. 1864</date></ref>). He became quite desperate for her return and implored her to &#x0201c;come <hi rend="italic">home</hi> to your own poor Nest ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;gird y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> soul heroically together; come my little Heroine, and let me see you &#x02026; by my side ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> for weal and woe. We have had a great deal of hard travelling together; we will not break down yet, please God!&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18640929-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-09-29">29 Sept. 1864</date></ref>).</p>
<p>It is clear that JWC was both physically and emotionally very fragile even though, apart from a short-lived cold, she remained comparatively well until early May after the end of this volume. Her friendship with Lady Ashburton was a great source of comfort to her and she received her many visits gladly even though she &#x0201c;has been in town again, keeping me out of bed till near twelve! bless her!&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641125-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1864-11-25">25 Nov. 1864</date>]</ref>). Her intense feelings for the younger woman were expressed directly in a letter to Lady Ashburton when <pb id="pg-41-xv" n="41:xv"/>JWC told her: &#x0201c;I do so want to be your &#x02018;first foot&#x02019;! on paper; since it cannot be in person. &#x02026; for true love is a good gift to have laid at one&#x02019;s feet&#x02014;a whole armful of it! &#x02026; next new years day &#x02026; you shall see if I dont sit outside your bedroom door till you awake &#x02026; and speak the first &#x02018;God bless you&#x02019; and get your first kiss! Oh my Darling! Oh my Darling!&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641231-JWC-LLA-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1864-12-31">31 Dec. 1864</date></ref>). The only way she knew how to reciprocate all this kindness was by supporting Lady Ashburton wholeheartedly in her quarrel with the Baring family over Lord Ashburton&#x02019;s will. She needed the reassurance of the continual visits from friends, the reassurance that she still played an important part in another&#x02019;s life. This friendship with Lady Ashburton, extended to TC, was such that in <date when="1865-04-00">April 1865</date> Lady Ashburton arranged for and paid Thomas Woolner a hundred guineas to make a bust of TC, though as JWC told Lady Ashburton: &#x0201c;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C drives him [Woolner] to despair &#x02026; by the different aspects he presents&#x0201d; ([<date when="1865-04-17">17 April 1865</date>]). For the purposes of the bust, Woolner wanted several photographs of TC from different angles. These were taken in sessions with John Watkins and with Elliott &#x26;Fry in <date when="1865-04-00">April</date>; they also took photographs of JWC, which to her delight were given to her &#x0201c;gratis&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18650425-JWC-MC-01">JWC to MC, [ca. <date when="1865-04-25">25 April 1865</date>]</ref>). These photographs of TC were sold to the general public, while copies of both their photographs were sent enthusiastically to friends and relatives.</p>
<p>After her return from Scotland in autumn <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>, TC seemed to become particularly aware of JWC&#x02019;s continued commitment and loyalty to him and to his work. It was therefore decided that they could well afford a brougham for JWC &#x0201c;all to herself&#x0201d; since, as TC told his brother John, &#x0201c;[t]wo hours of driving is not enough for Jane, and the Silvester Fly is always a hurried strict affair: we are all astir accordingly, to get her a Brougham, horse &#x26;driver &#x02026; (Farie &#x26;c very busy), and hope to succeed in a few days&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641012-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, [ca. <date when="1864-10-12">12 Oct. 1864</date>]</ref>). According to TC, JWC had &#x0201c;never sighed for [one] in my hearing, one faint time&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641230-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1864-12-20">20 Dec.1864</date></ref>). He later wrote in his notes to her letters that he had tried previously to tempt her to buy a brougham but she always had avoided the step even when he told her that &#x0201c;&#x02018;[n]o wife in England deserves better to have a brougham from her husband, or is worthier to drive it&#x02019;&#x0201d; (Froude <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:229). She shared her delight in the purchase with Mary Russell, suggesting that in the long run it would be cheaper as two hours in the &#x0201c;fly&#x0201d; cost six shillings (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641031-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1864-10-31">31 Oct. 1864</date></ref>). The acquiring of the brougham brought a great deal of pleasure to JWC. She could now repay the kindnesses of friends who had loaned her their carriages in the past; she could shop from the carriage window; she could visit friends on the off-chance that they were at home. In <date when="1864-12-00">December 1864</date> she wrote excitedly to Mary Russell telling her: &#x0201c;[t]he most spirited thing I have done since you last heard of me was driving to Acton with&#x02014;&#x02014;Madame Elise!! to see her beautiful place there and take a dinner-tea with her &#x02026; arriving at home as late as <pb id="pg-41-xvi" n="41:xvi"/>six o&#x02019;clock!!&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641219-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1864-12-19">19 Dec. 1864</date>]</ref>). Giuseppe Mazzini while visiting London wrote to Matilda Biggs, <date when="1865-03-04">4 March 1865</date>: &#x0201c;Mrs Carlyle&#x02014;who comes in a coach, stops invariably at some distance in the road and compels me to go to her and exhibit myself to a very inquisitive neighbourhood in slippers and hat&#x02014;came two days ago with the modest request of twelve autographs of mine for a Bazar&#x0201d; (Giuseppe Mazzini, <hi rend="italic">Scritti Editi ed Inediti di Giuseppe Mazzini</hi>, 94 vols. [Imola, <date when="1903-00-00">1903</date>&#x02013;<date when="1943-00-00">43</date>] 80:124).</p>
<p>The Carlyles&#x02019; financial state had improved considerably in the last 30 years. No longer was TC having to think about and give public lectures as he had had to do in the <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>s, when to earn &#x000a3;135 was enough to keep them both for a year. He noted later that at that time: &#x0201c;My poor little Jeannie and me, hasn&#x02019;t it nearly killed us both? &#x02026; I suppose by this time our money, too, was near done&#x0201d; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 1:70). After the publication of the first two volumes in <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date> of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> for which Chapman &#x26;Hall had paid &#x000a3;2,800, they were more financially secure and could look forward without the constant need to economize, though through habit they continued to live almost frugally. By the <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>s TC had built up, with the aid of his brother John, Charles Butler in America, and George Cooke, quite an extensive portfolio of shares, mostly in the burgeoning railway companies, both in Britain and in America. His other books were also selling well and he was receiving regular payments from Tauchnitz in Berlin for the English language edition of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> published in Germany. Chapman &#x26;Hall paid him &#x000a3;1,675 for volumes 5 and 6 in <date when="1865-04-00">April</date>. He wrote to John telling him that he found &#x0201c;&#x000a3;2,000 to <hi rend="italic">invest</hi>&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18650426-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1865-04-26">26 April 1865</date></ref>), a quite considerable sum in <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>. On a visit in <date when="1865-03-00">March</date> to Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s new house at Seaton in Devon they toyed with the idea of buying a &#x0201c;Devonshire Craigenputtoch&#x0201d; which was well within their budget. Unfortunately when TC commented that JWC should &#x0201c;&#x02018;die of the Solitude in six months&#x02019;&#x0201d; and she replied &#x0201c;Oh, no! for I will keep constant company,&#x0201d; the plan was immediately dropped (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18650329-JWC-MO-01">JWC to MO, <date when="1865-03-29">29 March 1865</date></ref>). TC&#x02019;s plan was to escape from people, not to encourage them to visit.</p>
<p>Considering the extensive reporting in the newspapers during this volume it is surprising how little the Carlyles commented upon the Civil War that was drawing to a close in America. There is little doubt that the death in <date when="1864-03-00">March 1864</date> of Lord Ashburton curtailed the number of people with whom they might have discussed the subject. Much of their correspondence in relation to it involved telling friends of the visitors from America who found their way to Cheyne Row. Earlier some of these visitors had confirmed TC&#x02019;s beliefs that the slaves in the southern states lived in happy co-existence with their owners in a sort of Utopia. Others, such as Moncure Conway, tried to persuade him otherwise. But he remained ambivalent until he received a letter from Ralph Waldo Emerson in <date when="1864-09-00">September 1864</date> when he revised his thoughts on the subject. Emerson, assuming that TC agreed with him, lamented that TC had <pb id="pg-41-xvii" n="41:xvii"/>never visited America: &#x0201c;[t]en days&#x02019; residence in this country would have made you the organ of the sanity of England &#x26;of Europe to us &#x26;to them&#x0201d;; he longed to &#x0201c;enlist you with your thunderbolt. &#x02026; Slaveholders in London have filled English ears with their wishes &#x26;perhaps beliefs; and our people, generals, &#x26;politicians, have carried the like &#x02026; to the war, until corrected by irre-sistible experience. I shall always respect War hereafter. The cost of life, the dreary havoc of comfort&#x0201d; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 541&#x02013;42). These words really disturbed TC&#x02019;s thinking on the problems facing America. In <date when="1865-03-00">March 1865</date> TC wrote to John Reuben Thompson: &#x0201c;Alas, alas; I never heard of such a War in all my reading; I believe in the annals of the Human Species there was never such another!&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18650327-TC-JRT-01">TC to JRT, <date when="1865-03-27">27 March 1865</date></ref>).</p>
<p>JWC was more concerned with domestic rather than international news. The excitement of the trial of Franz M&#x000fc;ller for the robbery and murder in <date when="1864-07-00">July 1864</date> of a fellow traveler on the North London Railway had prompted JWC to send Mrs. Russell a copy of a newspaper report (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641031-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1864-10-31">31 Oct. 1864</date>]</ref>). JWC continued to display her ability to regale and entertain her correspondents with interesting episodes in the life of 5 Cheyne Row. She related excitedly in her inimitable fashion and at great length to Mary Russell the shocking story of her cook Mary&#x02019;s production of a child in the little room behind the dining room while TC was entertaining Geraldine Jewsbury to tea. What appeared to have upset JWC more than the illegitimate birth was the falseness and disloyalty of Mary who for many months had been &#x0201c;giving suppers to men and women, downstairs&#x0201d; in the Cheyne Row kitchen, and the fact that she had been &#x0201c;made a fool of, and laughed at for my softness&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641112-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1864-11-12">12 Nov. 1864</date></ref>). She also wrote a detailed description of the event to very recently married Kate Stanley, now Lady Amberley.</p>
<p>It is when the Carlyles were apart that we are allowed to witness their true affection for each other. TC displayed his awareness of JWC&#x02019;s perpetual commitment and loyalty to him and to his work; it was she who organized his home, kept unwanted visitors at bay, always put his needs before her own. Indeed the letters exchanged in September of <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date> almost entirely concern the redecoration of 5 Cheyne Row in preparation for JWC&#x02019;s return from Scotland, her worries about inconveniencing TC, the everyday running of their home, and, with seeming justification, the trustworthiness of their maids. As always, she felt she ought to be at home in Chelsea with TC, but the thought of the journey south obviously frightened her and the prospect of having TC&#x02019;s brother John accompanying her was anathema to her as she told TC: &#x0201c;I dare not meditate on my journey&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">when</hi> it is to be or <hi rend="italic">how&#x02014;</hi>It is a terrible prospect!&#x02014;John was [on the journey to Dumfriesshire] a very disobliging travelling companion&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18640902-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-09-02">2 Sept. 1864</date>]</ref>). His letters, particularly, are peppered with &#x0201c;Dearests&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Darlings&#x0201d; and his continued worries about her. On the second of September he wrote: &#x0201c;I send my heart&#x02019;s love to thee, <pb id="pg-41-xviii" n="41:xviii"/>and all the blessings I can pray for&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18640902-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-09-02">2 Sept. 1864</date></ref>). He wanted and needed her home with him. Writing on <ref target="volume-41/lt-18640920-TC-JWC-01"><date when="1864-09-20">20 September</date></ref>, he told her &#x0201c;the only thing I can do is to wish you <hi rend="italic">here</hi> ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> such as you are; quiet at y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own chimney nook where it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be new life to me to see you sitting never so lame, if not quite too miserable, and in pain <hi rend="italic">un</hi>endurable.&#x0201d;</p>
<p>The letters let us into their lives whether they were exchanging gossip or reporting on who had visited Cheyne Row. Through their daily letters&#x02014;and they both complained if there was not one&#x02014;we know how they passed their days, their concerns not only for their own health but for that of the other. TC was also feeling his age (he was now almost 70) and complained of a shaking of his right hand in addition to the on-going problems with his liver. They still tended to keep many of their personal concerns to themselves. JWC reported to TC in <date when="1864-09-00">September 1864</date> that his sister Jean had told her that her son &#x0201c;&#x02018;young James had been to Chelsea last Monday and found his uncle [TC] very cheery and well.&#x02019; &#x02018;Maybe he was nae great joodge&#x02019;!&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18640912-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-09-12">12 Sept. 1864</date>]</ref>). JWC was also careful not to share <hi rend="italic">her</hi> problems with other people, telling TC: &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t say much about my nights except to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. People get to be such bores with their &#x02018;sleeplessness&#x02019;!&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18640920-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-09-20">20 Sept. 1864</date>]</ref>). This volume of letters offers readers the opportunity to view the Carlyles in sickness and in health, in work and at leisure. They complemented each other. As they aged they depended more and more on their nearest and dearest friends, in many ways becoming more insular, the behavior and mores of the mid-Victorian era only encroaching upon them as it affected them directly. Even so, the &#x0201c;man of Genius&#x0201d; and his wife, a certain kind of genius in her own right, exist as exemplars of nineteenth century life in all its variety.</p>

<p><bold><date when="1864-00-00">1864</date></bold> <hi rend="italic">September</hi>. JWC is in Scotland, &#x0201c;in the valley of the shadow of Blue pill!&#x0201d; ([<date when="1864-09-01">1</date>]) and TC reports the house is ready for the decorators (<date when="1864-09-01">1</date>). JWC begins to agitate about traveling home, with or without John A. Carlyle&#x02019;s escort ([<date when="1864-09-02">2</date>]); she writes to condole with Charlotte Southam on the death of her father ([<date when="1864-09-06">6</date>]). JWC worries that TC has to deal with the paper hangers ([<date when="1864-09-06">6</date>]), but TC assures her that they &#x0201c;give [him] a minimum of disturbance&#x0201d; ([<date when="1864-09-07">7</date>]) while he continues to struggle with <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1864-09-09">9</date> [<date when="1864-09-08">8</date>]). JWC tells him that &#x0201c;D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell [is] much the best D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> that I have had&#x0201d; ([<date when="1864-09-08">8</date>]). TC sends his condolences to Charles Augustus Ward (<date when="1864-09-11">11</date>) on the death of his mother. JWC suffers a relapse; she is invited to visit Jean Aitken in Dumfries and her aunts in Edinburgh, but says all her strength will be needed to get home ([<date when="1864-09-01">12</date>]). TC reports that &#x0201c;[t]he Paperhangers <hi rend="italic">have</hi> finished!&#x0201d; (<date when="1864-09-01">13</date>); JWC continues to send instructions about house cleaning ([<date when="1864-09-01">14</date>]). JWC writes Mary Craik (<date when="1864-09-17">17</date>) hoping she has not been harmed during the riots in Belfast. JWC is delighted at the engagements of Kate and Rosalind Stanley ([<date when="1864-09-20">20</date>]), and TC writes to congratulate Lady Stanley (<date when="1864-09-21">21</date>). In spite of misgivings TC encourages JWC to accept John A. Carlyle as a traveling companion (<date when="1864-09-23">23</date>) and asks John to be particularly &#x0201c;gentle, <hi rend="italic">patient</hi>, patient, and <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> and yielding in all respects&#x0201d; with JWC (<date when="1864-09-24">24</date>). She feels most unwell, but tells TC ([<date when="1864-09-27">27</date>]) she intends to travel overnight on the following Friday. TC writes encouragingly to JWC, &#x0201c;Gird y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self up &#x02026; for a <hi rend="italic">resolute</hi> adventure&#x0201d; (<date when="1864-09-28">28</date>), and tells Lady Ashburton &#x0201c;[t]he poor Wife is coming to me tomorrow; travels all night &#x02026; my Brother escorting &#x02026; I confess I shudder at the enterprise: but they say it can be done, with care&#x0201d; (<date when="1864-09-30">30</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">October</hi>. JWC returns to Chelsea, health visibly improved. She checks household affairs after her absence and drives two hours daily for fresh air (<date when="1864-10-01">1</date>). TC later wrote that his life has been a &#x0201c;comatose flight&#x0201d; battling with <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, but he looks back on the last 18 months of JWC&#x02019;s life, from this point on, as &#x0201c;a second youth (almost a second childhood with the wisdom and graces of old age)&#x0201d; (<date when="1864-10-04">4</date>). He writes to ask his brother John to deal with small matters he has no time for (<date when="1864-10-06">6</date>). JWC contrives to get new milk and fresh cream to keep up her gains in health since Scotland. She writes both to Mary Austin ([<date when="1864-10-09">9</date>]) and to Mary Russell ([<date when="1864-10-10">10</date>]) to tell of her many visitors, including George Cooke and Lord Houghton, and she writes to Lady Airlie ([<date when="1864-10-12">12</date>]), who then visits ([<date when="1864-10-17">17</date>]). TC asks Joseph Neuberg and Robert Farie to help find a brougham and horse <pb id="pg-41-xxviii" n="41:xxviii"/>for JWC&#x02019;s use (<date when="1864-10-13">13</date>) and asks his sister Jean in Scotland to procure him winter clothes, while JWC asks Mary Austin to send fresh eggs from Scotland. Though her health is better, JWC confides to Mary: &#x0201c;I can never feel confident of Life and of Ease in Life again ([<date when="1864-10-18">18</date>]).&#x0201d; Lady Ashburton visits regularly. The Forsters return to London. Prospective servants for Cheyne Row are being interviewed. Woolner pays an emotional visit to JWC (<date when="1864-10-23">23</date>). JWC tells Mary Russell she is taking quinine regularly ([<date when="1864-10-24">24</date>]). John Piper, the Carlyles&#x02019; former postman (now mentally unstable), visits JWC for confidential advice about a divorce; JWC describes her new brougham to Mary Russell, and reports that TC expects to finish <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> &#x0201c;about new-year&#x0201d; ([<date when="1864-10-31">31</date>]).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">November</hi>. Though catching cold, JWC continues her daily drive, taking a hot water bottle. Neuberg continues to help TC with editorial and manuscript work (<date when="1864-11-08">1</date> [<date when="1864-11-09">9</date>]). JWC describes to Mary Russell the severe cold of the last week, though she continues her daily drive ([<date when="1864-11-12">12</date>]); she then tells the story (suppressed by Froude) of the birth of an illegitimate child to Mary the maid in Chelsea in <date when="1864-07-00">July</date> during JWC&#x02019;s absence in Scotland; there is now a complete change of servants in Cheyne Row. TC tells his brother &#x0201c;My Book goes on,&#x02014;slower than I wish; but daily does advance&#x0201d; (<date when="1864-11-17">17</date>). JWC describes to Mary Russell her daily routine, three hour drive (staying in the carriage rather than paying visits), then, after dinner seeing company at home in the evening: &#x0201c;I take <hi rend="italic">pills</hi> at a great rate! Can&#x02019;t help myself. &#x02026; People begin to come back&#x02014;and I have more company than I need&#x0201d; ([<date when="1864-11-25">25</date>]).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">December</hi>. TC asks Forster if he would like one of Neuberg&#x02019;s friends to translate his <hi rend="italic">Life of Goldsmith</hi> into German (<date when="1864-12-01">1</date>). TC complains of toothache (<date when="1864-12-02">2</date>) and JWC again voices her fear, expressed earlier in <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>, that her suffering would drive her mad (<date when="1864-12-02">2</date>). JWC praises Woolner&#x02019;s bust of Lord Ashburton to Lady Ashburton (<date when="1864-12-07">7</date>). TC&#x02019;s timetable for finishing <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> begins to slip; he declines an invitation to Alderley (<date when="1864-12-08">8</date>). JWC writes affectionately to Margaret Oliphant (<date when="1864-12-09">9</date>) and visits Madame Elise, her very successful dressmaker, in her country house in Acton. London receives a heavy snowfall ([<date when="1864-12-19">19</date>]). JWC thanks Mary Austin for eggs and butter from Scotland (<date when="1864-12-21">21</date>). Mrs. Warren, the new cook, proves satisfactory. JWC sends a bracelet as a new year&#x02019;s gift to Mary Russell, acknowledged as safely received (<date when="1864-12-30">30</date>), and sends warm new year&#x02019;s greetings to Lady Ashburton (<date when="1864-12-31">31</date>).</p>
 <p><bold><date when="1865-00-00">1865</date></bold> <hi rend="italic">January</hi>. JWC continues to ride two&#x02013;three hours daily in her brougham; she keeps up a correspondence with her friends and acknowledges gifts of fresh food and whisky from Scotland ([<date when="1865-01-05">5</date>]). TC asks Lady Ashburton to take back the gray mare that had been pulling JWC&#x02019;s brougham but was unfit for the work (<date when="1865-01-05">5</date>). He admits &#x0201c;I really am close on the edge of <hi rend="italic">finis</hi>&#x0201d; (<date when="1865-01-05">5</date>); he sends the last part of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> to press on <date when="1865-01-05">15 Jan.</date> The weather is very changeable in <pb id="pg-41-xxix" n="41:xxix"/>London. TC falls from his horse; JWC writes Mary Russell that both Carlyles are lamed, but that she is slowly recovering her power of walking ([<date when="1865-01-13">13</date>]). On <date when="1864-01-20">20 Jan.</date> TC settles his financial affairs and asks his brother to invest &#x000a3;3,000 for him; he expects another &#x000a3;2,000 soon from the proceeds of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>. JWC writes George Morrall, who has asked for a good portrait of TC, confirming that neither of them thought such a thing existed, but encloses a <hi rend="italic">carte de visite</hi> as an inadequate substitute (<date when="1865-01-28">28</date>). Late on <date when="1864-01-29">29 Jan.</date>, JWC becomes violently ill with a cold and is treated by young Dr. Barnes of Chelsea.</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">February</hi>. JWC&#x02019;s health slowly improves. Printer assures TC he will be finished by <date when="1864-02-06">6 Feb.</date>; there are last minute problems with illustrations (<date when="1865-02-06">6</date>). When JWC&#x02019;s health improves, they plan to go to Seaforth Lodge, Seaton, Devon, Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s new seaside holiday residence. TC, in the relief of finishing Frederick, visits dentist and barber and clears off his correspondence (<date when="1865-02-06">6</date>). JWC is well enough to sit up but still very weak (8). Henry Larkin is asked to combine all the indexes of the volumes of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> into one; this proves an enormous task and TC&#x02019;s impatience causes a breach between them (9). TC asks Rev. Gerald Blunt of Chelsea to board his horse, Noggs, while they are away (<date when="1865-02-10">10</date>). More eggs and fresh oatcakes arrive from Scotland ([ca. <date when="1865-02-12">12</date>]). JWC writes Betty Braid to console her on the death of her son (<date when="1865-02-14">14</date>). Chapman pays TC for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1865-02-15">15</date>); at Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s suggestion the Carlyles postpone going to Seaforth Lodge until the weather improves (<date when="1865-02-16">16</date>). TC tells his sister Jean of his intention of remaining with Scottish-made clothes rather than buying London-made ones (<date when="1865-02-19">19</date>). JWC resumes her daily ride in the brougham (<date when="1865-02-16">16</date>), and TC writes John Ruskin to thank him for a box of cigars (<date when="1865-02-22">22</date>) and proposes a visit (<date when="1865-02-25">25</date>). Dr. Richard Quain visits JWC socially ([<date when="1865-02-28">28</date>]).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">March</hi>. &#x0201c;I am the idlest of all mankind&#x0201d; writes TC; he complains about an increasingly shaking hand (<date when="1865-03-01">1</date>). The postponed visit to Seaton, Devon, now takes place (<date when="1865-03-08">8</date>). Both Carlyles are delighted with the house, and JWC writes Mary Russell in superlatives, warmly inviting her and Dr. Russell to visit her in Chelsea after their holiday ends, while TC goes on a round of Scottish visits (<date when="1865-03-10">10</date>). The Woolners visit Seaforth Lodge. Vols. 5 and 6 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> are pbd. mid-<date when="1865-03-00">March</date>. TC rides around the countryside, though he complains to his brother John of inability to relax or enjoy his leisure time. He agrees to try to write a memoir of Sir William Hamilton &#x0201c;whom I honour and love so truly.&#x0201d; Larkin&#x02019;s index to <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> is finished (<date when="1865-03-20">20</date>). TC writes despairingly of the American Civil War (<date when="1865-03-27">27</date>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">April</hi>. The Carlyles return (with Lady Ashburton) to London (<date when="1865-04-03">3</date>). TC begins his sittings for Woolner&#x02019;s bust (<date when="1865-04-06">6</date>), commissioned by Lady Ashburton (but not finished until <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>). He resumes riding Noggs (<date when="1865-04-08">8</date>). JWC writes a friendly letter to Mary Smith (<date when="1865-04-10">10</date>). TC writes Larkin to acknowledge all his help in <pb id="pg-41-xxx" n="41:xxx"/><hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and sends a check in thanks (<date when="1865-04-13">13</date>). JWC, writing to Mary Russell, complains of a dip in health after returning to London; she is in the process of acquiring a new horse for her brougham (<date when="1865-04-14">14</date>). TC is photographed by John Watkins, <date when="1864-04-15">15</date> and <date when="1864-04-17">17 April</date>; JWC also is photographed by Watkins. Elliott &#x26;Fry photographed TC and JWC at about the same time. JWC addresses Lady Ashburton as &#x0201c;my Dearest, my Beautifulest! My Best!&#x0201d; and begs her to visit in London (<date when="1865-04-17">17</date>). TC reads reviews of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1865-04-26">26</date>) and attends the Committee of the National Portrait Gallery (<date when="1865-04-27">27</date>). JWC welcomes Charles Gavan Duffy back to London after a 10 year absence (<date when="1865-04-26">26</date>), and invites him to visit in Chelsea.</p>

<p>Just two lines between having finished dressing and going out to drive&#x02014; I have been kept in bed till near midday, that my &#x0201c;joints&#x0201d; might be carefully examined; and afterwards a mustard-blister applied up my spine. It is all right with the joints as yet&#x02014;except for external stiffness, D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> R says.

In the mean time I am to apply frequent mustard blisters&#x02014; Oh if <hi rend="italic">the horror</hi> would only go away, and stay away, as it did for near a fortnight; I should be very resigned to permanent crippledness!</p>

<p>It was not that <hi rend="italic">the irritation</hi> was <hi rend="italic">very</hi> bad&#x02014;nothing like what it had often been!&#x02014; But when I had been free of it for a while, the return even in a mild form was like to drive me wild!</p>
<p>I dare not meditate on my journey&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">when</hi> it is to be or <hi rend="italic">how</hi>&#x02014; It is a terrible prospect!&#x02014; John was a very disobliging travelling companion&#x02014;and when he gets into the house he keeps possession.

<p>Here we are at the beginning of a new week: and God grant it be better than the last! Up to last night I got no sleep, and the <hi rend="italic">irritation</hi> was getting worse and worse: and I had &#x0201c;lost my happetite.&#x0201d;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440626-JWC-TC-01"><sic>18:87</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1844-06-26">26 June 1844</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> and was altogether in a miserable way. Last night I slept&#x02014;an hour at a time&#x02014;for five or six hours. Curious! <hi rend="italic">every</hi> time that I got out of bed and looked at my watch, it was always <hi rend="italic">an exact hour</hi> from the time I had looked last&#x02014;half past one, half past two, half past three, and so on to half past six! Certainly the vagaries of my sleep would make an interesting chapter in a medical book. By D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell&#x02019;s recommendation I took last night <hi rend="italic">two</hi> glasses of wine <hi rend="italic">at once</hi> (!) three hours after my porridge and milk&#x02014;and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> made no difference on the one-hour-duration of my sleep!</p>
<p>It vexes me to think of you worried with all that papering  As I can be of no use to you, I might at least one would say be of no bother! Oh dear Oh dear! what a lot for me&#x02014;and I cannot help it&#x02014;to be of no use any more; but only a burden and a plague!</p>
<p>I wrote a note to Geraldine on Saturday <hi rend="italic">after</hi> posttime,&#x02014;which will go today. <hi rend="italic">Why</hi> I should write to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> whom I have been so dissatisfied with&#x02014;at a time when more than usually ill and depressed&#x02014;needs explanation&#x02014;in case she make a fuss about having heard from &#x0201c;Jane&#x0201d;&#x02014;</p>
<p>She wrote to me as she had told you, some weeks ago&#x02014;a disagreeable letter&#x02014;the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> letter she had written to me thro&#x02019; all my illness&#x02014;every one of them <hi rend="italic">disagreeable</hi> about her parties and her new clothes &#x26;c &#x26;c! I should have delayed answering; into the vague&#x02014;had not there been inclosed in the <pb id="pg-41-7" n="41:7"/>letter to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> a note to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell&#x02014;full of passionate anxiety to have news of me (which could have been got any day at Cheyne Row)! and <hi rend="italic">imploring</hi> M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell to write and tell her how I was&#x02014;quite Geraldinish, the whole thing!

<p>When the rooms are done pray charge the maids<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen and Mary.</note> not to rub on the clean paper with their abominable large Crinolines and not to push back the chairs against it, as their habit is! and tell Mary to sleep in my bed from time to time&#x02014;to keep it aired&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">Mary</hi>&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> Helen in my bed&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">She</hi> (Helen) perspires so dreadfully that she would do the reverse of <hi rend="small-caps">airing</hi> it!</p>

<p><salute>Dearest.</salute> I often think it would have been a better arrangement that <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi> should write, as you do, every day; but <hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> only now and then, when I should feel best up to writing! You should thus have been spared many wretched lamentations, which, by being <hi rend="italic">kept in</hi> for a few days, would have been rendered superfluous&#x02014;if indeed lamentations are ever other than superfluous. Today it is again raining&#x02014;there has been much rain during the last week. And I think that damp is more injurious to me than cold. all my <hi rend="italic">pains</hi> are aggravated by it and my spirits depressed; And the daily drive, which always brightened me up a little in the fine weather; is no good with closed windows and the wet trickling down them!</p>
<p>I had again some sleep last night&#x02014;little, and bad, what was of it, but a great improvement on none at all. Now that the weather and my sense of <hi rend="italic">propriety</hi> (!) both drive me on the thought of return; that thought haunts me day and night! How am I ever to perform such a journey, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> the strength of desperation which supported me here?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC traveled to Scotland <date when="1864-07-13">13 July</date> see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640715-JWC-MR-01"><sic>40:135</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1864-07-15">15 July [1864]</date></corr></ref>.</note> It is not to be wished that I should be strengthened in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> wild way again! And after? Oh that it were as easy to put tormenting thoughts out of ones own head as it is for others to bid one do that!</p>
<p>I wish to Heaven you were delivered from these paperhangers I did not think it would have been so long in the wind. I, the unlucky cause, am quite as sorry for the botheration to <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi> as Jane expresses <hi rend="italic">herself</hi>;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly JWC referred to Jean Aitken&#x02019;s comments to TC, [<date when="1864-08-21">21 Aug.</date>]: &#x0201c;You seem very solitary indeed, but you can bear <hi rend="italic">that</hi> for the present better than bustle or worry of any sort.&#x0201d; She also wrote: &#x0201c;What a blessing if [JWC] could get out of this long dark lane she has come thro&#x02019; since Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last.

There really seemed to be <hi rend="italic">no</hi> turning visible for a long while.&#x0201d;</note> tho I have more appreciation of the terrible half-insane sensitiveness which drove me on so bothering you. Oh if God would only lift my trouble off me so far that I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> bear it in all silence! and not add to the own troubles of others!</p>
 <p><pb id="pg-41-10" n="41:10"/>The cheque came all safe&#x02014;the repayment of the sovereign is amusing&#x02014;when it is considered that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have long ceased to be on &#x0201c;allowance&#x0201d;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For JWC&#x02019;s satirical response, <date when="1855-02-00">Feb. 1855</date>, to the need to apply for more money to TC, both for her own allowance and the household budget, see &#x0201c;B<hi rend="small-caps">udget</hi> <hi rend="italic">of a Femme incomprise</hi>&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18550212-JWC-TC-01"><sic>29:251&#x02013;58</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1855-02-12">12 Feb. 1855</date>]</corr></ref>).</note>&#x02014;</p>

<p>I cannot write a letter today. I have passed a terrible night sleeplessness, and restlessness, and <hi rend="italic">the old pain</hi> (worse than it has ever been since I came here) and in addition to all that, an inward blackness of darkness! Am I going to have another winter like the last? I cannot live thro&#x02019; another such time&#x02014;my Reason at least cannot live thro&#x02019; it!</p>
<p>It is a fact that for a fortnight past I have been getting gradually into the old tack. and I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> so much better! had almost ceased to look for the return of <hi rend="italic">the pain</hi>! That is why I feel so wild under it now.</p>

<p>No worse today Dear; but neither can I call myself better. <hi rend="italic">The pain</hi> was worse yesterday evening, than it had ever been since I left St Leonards; and the night, tho&#x02019; I <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> off and on, was most restless and miserable.

<p>The weather has indeed been most unsettled and D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell thinks it probable that the reason of my back-going lies in <hi rend="italic">that</hi>. But whatever it lies in the results of misery and disappointment for me are much the same!</p>

<p><salute>My own dear Jeannie,</salute> I am very wae ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> thee, poor little suffering soul: but I was infinitely thankful too for the wee Letter this morning;&#x02014;indeed it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have made me quite glad ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, had not my spirits been otherwise already below par. Want of <hi rend="italic">potatoes</hi>,&#x02014;want of regular bodily health: nay it must be admitted I am myself too irregular, with no Goody near me!&#x02014; Yesternight Forster and Mrs were waiting my return; quite cut me out of my little nap,&#x02014;the consequence of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was, I slept <hi rend="italic">two hours</hi> after dinner, and then &#x26;c &#x26;c. The riding <hi rend="italic">before</hi> dinner proves a fine thing however; with brown bread &#x26;that,&#x02014;if I were but regular. There will be nothing for it but that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> come home and regulate.</p>
<p>Today there are no workpeople;&#x02014;I foresaw something of the kind from what the man at first said to me. <hi rend="italic">Not</hi> coming till Monday I perceive,&#x02014;wherefore Helen has washed down the stairs; and we are all snug, while waiting. Mrs Forster had got no ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> she said ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the curt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> poles<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-41/lt-18640905-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-09-05">5 Sept.</date></ref></note> (too ill for answer<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, my poor Goody!)&#x02014; &#x0201c;Have them <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, I said; it appears they will look -brighter!&#x0201d;</p>
<p>If you took a notion to be here <hi rend="italic">before</hi> these Hangers terminate,&#x02014;come: your Bed is standing; can be cleaned and furnished in a few hours,&#x02014;<hi rend="small-caps">all</hi> things <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> as need be; &#x26;y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> sad floor will look <hi rend="italic">more</hi> diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that way than any other!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Possibly you will have to put up with John, as the bad-best, after all? He is perfectly <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> to escort you. I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> make him understand (what w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> never answer for myself either) that he is to <hi rend="italic">stay</hi> in his own lodging.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

<p><salute>Dearest</salute> I can see from your letter this morning that you will like any sort of letter better than none. Besides after today come the two appointed blank days.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laws on the non-collection of mail in Scotland meant that Sun. and Mon. were &#x0201c;blank days&#x0201d; for letters sent by JWC to TC.</note> God grant that by the time these are over I may have better news to send.</p>
<p>I suffered less from <hi rend="italic">the pain</hi> yesterday evening, but there was no improvement in my nights rest. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell is giving me some very simple thing to try to lessen the need of getting out of bed every quarter of an hour. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell to whom he began giving it, for a much slighter affection of the same sort two days before he gave it to myself is already <hi rend="italic">all right</hi>. I might have been all right too perhaps, had it been given <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in right time&#x02014; But it is no good thinking of what <hi rend="italic">might have been</hi>! There are plenty of aids to insanity which <hi rend="italic">will</hi> offer themselves, without indulging in reflections like <hi rend="italic">that</hi>!</p>
<p>The weather is again most unfavourable. wind and rain&#x02014;rain and wind. Still it is too early in the season to expect nothing better.

<p><salute>Dearest&#x02014;</salute>you will be wondering how the blank days have passed with me&#x02014;much like the previous week&#x02014;not better&#x02014;but not worse; except saturday evening, when <hi rend="italic">the pain</hi> was worse than any time since I have been here. my nights continue painfully restless, tho&#x02019; not <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> without sleep.</p>
<p>To-day is dry and bright, with a little frost in the air. Frost does not seem now to have so bad an effect on me as damp; indeed all the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> say damp is the worst sort of atmosphere for neuralgia</p>
<p>My spirits are terribly crushed down by this relapse. I dont know that I was <pb id="pg-41-19" n="41:19"/>ever more depressed in all my illness. The few weeks of relief from that maddening irritation had made it like a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> and worse horror when it returned on me.</p>
<p>Surely, surely these wretched paper hangers will get done early this week! I never contemplated the thing lasting above two or three days. Let all the pictures in the Drawingroom as well as in my bed-room and closet lie heaped up till I am there to direct the hanging of them. I may be up to that much surely?&#x02014; Also tell the paper hanger to <hi rend="italic">leave</hi> all the odd pieces&#x02014;they are needed for repairing in case of accidents. It may not be <hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> that will ever need them&#x02014;but some one will.</p>
<p>I have a note from Jane at Dumfries<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x02019;s sister Jean Aitken.</note> inviting me to pay her &#x0201c;a composed visit of a week or two&#x0201d;&#x02014;quite <hi rend="italic">too late</hi> even had the thing been otherwise feasable. All my strength, and more, will be needed to get myself <hi rend="italic">straight</hi> home. My Aunts<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x02019;s aunts Ann, Elizabeth, and Grace Welsh in Morningside, Edinburgh.</note> too wished me to try Morningside; when they &#x0201c;would get me to see Simpson<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Young Simpson, Edinburgh physician and obstetrician.</note> who had made cures where all other D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> had failed.&#x0201d; But there is no hope for me in Simpson, or any other mortal Physicians.</p>

    <p>No Farmer with his crop still &lsquo;out&rsquo; could look out on the heavy rain this morning with more disappointment than I did! Yesterday was so bright and like the beginning of settled dry weather; and I thought, if it be the damp that has made me worse, then surely the dry cold will make me better again! And here we have the wettest day of all; so wet that the forenoon drive has had for the first time to be given up; and there has been no time to benifit by the change of yesterday&mdash;if indeed benifit <hi rend="italic">be</hi> in change of weather</p>
    <p>Oh these idiotic paperhangers! not to make sure of having paper enough!&mdash; Tell Mary when the rooms <hi rend="italic">are</hi> done and ready for occupation to take care that the <hi rend="italic">first fires put on</hi> be very small. I have known paper to come rattling all down by being dried too suddenly.</p>
    <p>Both the Diningroom and Drawingroom here have a brass rod about the thickness of a man&rsquo;s thumb&mdash;all round, at the top of the walls, and the pictures are suspended from these&mdash;so that there may be no breaking of the walls with nails&mdash; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell says such rods &ldquo;cost very little&rdquo;&mdash; I will ascertain how much&mdash;and you might speak to the paperhanger about it. Oh my Dear! when <pb id="pg-41-21" n="41:21" />
      <pb id="pg-41-22" n="41:22" />
      I have been giving directions about the House <hi rend="italic">there</hi>&mdash;a feeling like a great black wave will roll over my breast! and I say to myself&mdash;whatever pains be taken to gratify me; shall I ever more have a day of ease&mdash;of painlessness&mdash;or a night of sweet rest in that House, or in any House but the dark narrow one where I shall arrive at last?&mdash;</p>
    <p>I had two or three hours of <hi rend="italic">real refreshing sleep</hi> in M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Forsters bed<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">At Palace Gate House, Kensington, on her way through London; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640715-JWC-TC-01">

</ref>.</note>&mdash; The first night at the Gill, I slept the heavy sleep of exhaustion&mdash;and I had a good night after taking the first blue pill, here. And <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, without any exaggeration, is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the sleep to be called <hi rend="italic">human</hi> that I have had since we parted.

Nith<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >River Nith, flowing past Thornhill to Dumfries and into the Solway Firth.</note> is swollen like a Sea! In the window-place of the room I am sitting in, there are three soup-plates, one hand-basin, and two broken tea-cups catching <hi rend="italic">drops</hi>! It reminds me poignantly of certain wet days at Craigenputtoch. Thus circumstanced, especially as regarding <hi rend="italic">Sleep</hi>; the less I say about myself the better! Business is the safest topic.</p>
<p>I am thankful the paper-men are out of the House. I hope they have left some bits of paper behind them and that Mary has put them safely by. See to <pb id="pg-41-25" n="41:25"/>that, and <hi rend="italic">pray</hi> don&#x02019;t forget what I said about not overheating the rooms suddenly&#x02014; About the chinz-furniture&#x02014; Certainly, if it is dirty or even dirtyish, it ought to be cleaned and the natural and proper time for cleaning it would have been while it was out of use. A servant with a head would have needed no telling to that effect. But a servant with a head or even with half a head is a blessing not accorded us in these latter times! Tell Mary to pack it all together, keeping an account of the pieces, and then to call at <hi rend="italic">Elton&#x02019;s</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Elton, dyer, 52 and 53 Sloane St.</note> the Dyer and cleaner in Sloan Street&#x02014;nearly opposite Rhinds<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Rhind, ladies&#x02019; and infants&#x02019; outfitter, 189 Sloane St.</note> and tell <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to send for it, and make him appoint a time for having it done. It is too good chinz to be risked with poor old M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Cook who can no longer do the things herself, nor can she employ women who can. The things of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> washing that came to St Leonards were most unsatisfactory&#x02014;besides some good things changed for bad&#x02014;a new sheet for an old one &#x26;c&#x02014;a good night shirt of yours for some one else&#x02019;s old one!&#x02014;</p>
<p>And <hi rend="italic">remember</hi> not to meddle with the pictures!</p>
<p>It is no use setting a time for my return till there is a little bit of dry weather.

I have been thinking that, in the day-time, if D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle put me into the train at Carlisle, beside some other <hi rend="italic">woman</hi>, I should be just as well cared for as with <hi rend="italic">him</hi> going all the way.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

<p>Last night I had a little more sleep&#x02014;not &#x0201c;balmy&#x0201d; by any means&#x02014;but <hi rend="italic">any</hi> sort of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> is to be considered as a mercy now! Today the rain has come only in big showers&#x02014;with bright sunshine between. I hear of no harm done by the flood yesterday except the complete destruction of an embankment the Duke<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Francis Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th duke of Buccleuch.</note> was making a little below Holmhill  &#x0201c;It will be a great loss to the Duke.&#x0201d; Well! He can stand it!&#x02014; But I wish all prosperity to &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">The</hi> Duke&#x0201d;! He seems to be a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> man&#x02014;whatever other sort of man he may be  I have heard many nice things of him. Not merely in the way of <hi rend="italic">giving</hi>&#x02014;but&#x02014;for example,&#x02014;an old woman<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Agnes Brown (ca. <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x02013;<date when="1864-00-00">64</date>).</note> had an old cottage in a conspicuous part of the Park<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Drumlanrig Estate.</note>&#x02014; All the other cottages were new and highly ornamental; but this one was not only an eye-sore, but interfered with a new approach the Duke had planned. Nevertheless as old Aggy liked better her old cottage than any possible new one, the Duke promised her &#x0201c;his own self&#x0201d; and left strict orders, that so long as Aggy Brown lived, <hi rend="small-caps">her</hi> cottage was not to be meddled with. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> was kind&#x02014;human! The old woman died two or three months ago and the road is making, over the site of the old cottage.</p>
<p>The Duchess<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte, duchess of Buccleuch.</note> finding Margaret Hiddleston no longer in her Laundry (Fancy a Duchess <hi rend="italic">knowing</hi> what woman <hi rend="italic">washed</hi> for her!) inquired at D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell about her illness, and circumstances&#x02014;and sent her a quantity of wine and ordered that she should be cared for thro&#x02019; the winter. After hearing <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, I would have stayed in the room when &#x0201c;the Duchess&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;the Countess&#x0201d;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The duchess of Buccleuch was also a countess, as the duke had many titles, including at least two earldoms.</note> called here the other day; could I have executed a decent <hi rend="italic">curtsy</hi>; but in the actual state of my legs and back, I preferred making an ignominious retreat&#x02014;</p>
<p>I am thankful to see the Sun again! If <hi rend="italic">the misery</hi> would but fall into abeyance again! But I am never quite delivered from it now&#x02014;never since the day I was at Dumfries<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had recently spent a day shopping in Dumfries; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640826-JWC-TC-01"><sic>40:210</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-08-26">26 Aug.</date>]</corr></ref>.</note>&#x02014; Not that I suppose going to Dumfries hurt me&#x02014;but it <pb id="pg-41-27" n="41:27"/>so happened! I can bear all the rest, my neuralgia pains, my lameness, &#x26;c with patience, but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> seems to be connected with the nerves of my brain! I go wild under it. To keep up <hi rend="italic">pretence</hi> of <hi rend="italic">rationality</hi> is the most I am up to.</p>

<p>No, I should not like the bed in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> position. <hi rend="italic">I tried it there</hi>, and even when the space was wider by three feet it did not answer&#x02014; First objection, every time the door was opened a stream of cold air from open doors and windows poured right into the Bed. secondly, the <hi rend="italic">view</hi> from the passage of a <hi rend="italic">bed</hi> made or unmade, when the bedroom door was left open, did not fascinate the visitor&#x02019;s or inmate&#x02019;s eye like the pretty combination of books and pictures   thirdly I found the bed uncomfortably near the fire, (when there was a fire) both in regard to dust and heat, fourthly the maker of the bed had, in making it, to squeeze in between the bed and the wall rubbing against the paper&#x02014;ruinous in a case of crinoline! Oh if there were any sleep to be got in it wherever it stands! But it looks to my excited imagination, that Bed I was born in, a sort of instrument of red hot torture; after all those nights that I lay meditating on self-destruction, as my only escape from insanity! Oh the terriblest part of my suffering has not been what was <hi rend="italic">seen</hi>! has not been what <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be put into human language!</p>
<p>D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell wrote a note to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle yesterday&#x02014;so he will probably be here today&#x02014;he always comes on receiving a note. I read his letter and Walters<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably her cousin Rev. Walter Welsh.</note> but could see nothing to explain why you bid me read them! nothing <pb id="pg-41-29" n="41:29"/>but second and third news of <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>! who have my own news hot and hot! The more&#x02019;s the pity!</p>
<p>Good by Dear till Monday</p>

    <salute>My dear Mary</salute>
    <p>I did not remember that I had promised to write again, <hi rend="italic">without being written to</hi>; when I should have any good to tell. The promise must have been made &ldquo;in a moment of enthusiasm&rdquo;; such disinterestedness being quite out of my line! I have had both good news and bad news to tell, several times over, since I came here. After the first three weeks I was in good spirits about myself. For the first time since my illness I thought it possible I should really recover! My sleep continued perfectly <hi rend="italic">inhuman</hi> but I was gaining flesh rapidly, was less nervous, and, best of all, <hi rend="italic">the irritation</hi> remained in abeyance, so that I was no longer <hi rend="italic">afraid to eat</hi>! Since the weather became unsettled, and often wet, I have been worse in <hi rend="italic">every way</hi>; except that I have not yet lost any of the weight I had gained (within two pounds of <hi rend="italic">a stone</hi>!!! As I still <hi rend="italic">look thin enough, that</hi> brings it home &ldquo;to my business and my bosom&rdquo;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Cf. the dedication to Francis Bacon, <hi rend="italic">The Essayes or Counsels, Civill and Morall, of Francis Lo.

On the whole however, could I but compare my present state with the St <pb id="pg-41-31" n="41:31" />Leonards state, instead of, always, with the state of <hi rend="italic">wellness</hi>, which my weary heart longs after, I should find myself, I suppose, considerably improved.</p>
    <p>I have had every chance <hi rend="italic">here</hi> that could possibly have been given me on this earth! the purest of air, new-milk <hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi> [at will], perfect kindness, absence of all worry, and the best medical skill I know of! I must soon however leave all this for the tender mercies of Chelsea, God help me! It will not do to postpone my journey&mdash;terrible to my imagination, now that the wild excitement, on the strength of which I came here, has subsided&mdash;till the cold weather sets in. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell says &ldquo;to catch a cold in my present state would be the fatalest thing I could do&mdash;&rdquo; so I think of going home in a week or two. All seems prospering there. At least M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is considerate enough to not bother me with the short comings of the maids&mdash;if they <hi rend="italic">do</hi> come short.

<p>There is nothing new to tell, Dear. I continue to have wretched nights&#x02014;my nights have never been to be called <hi rend="italic">good</hi> even when at my best here; but for the last week they have been even worse than usual. My snatches of sleep all added together make scarcely what you would consider a fair allowance for after-dinner; and the quality is as unsatisfactory as the quantity&#x02014;restless and painful. Still my nights do not react on my days as one would expect. Except in <hi rend="italic">the special ailment</hi>. which is indeed the most important of all, I hardly seem to suffer from them! I have not lost flesh, I do not feel weaker, when once up and dressed. Only <hi rend="italic">the irritation</hi> is pretty <hi rend="italic">constant</hi> not as <hi rend="italic">severe</hi> as it used to be, but bad enough to spoil all comfort in the present and to keep me in dread of worse. And to increase my unfitness for the long journey before me. After even the <hi rend="italic">two hours</hi> drive in the carriage, I come in every day, uncertain whether I had not better have wanted the air and exercise, than have increased my <hi rend="italic">discomfort</hi> to such a degree. Last night I took a blue pill&#x02014;but it did no good&#x02014; I lay awake till between four and five after&#x02014; But neither does it seem to have done any harm. Often when I am lying tossing on my bed the words of poor bewildered M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Alfred Barnes.</note> seem spoken in my ear&#x02014;&#x0201d; You will never get rid of it! never! never!&#x0201d;&#x02014;</p>

He had presented one of his sticks to the Duke. Some years ago great depradations were committed in the Drumlanrig woods&#x02014;and an edict was issued that nobody should meddle with the trees, under penalty. On his way from Dabton<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dabton, estate 1&#xbd; mi. (2.5 km.) N of Thornhill.</note> where the Duke had been settling this with the Factor he bethought him of old Sandy&#x02014;and <hi rend="italic">the minute he got off his horse</hi>, he wrote a note to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Maxwell,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Maxwell (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x02013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630603-JWC-MR-01"><sic>39:142</sic><corr>JWC to MR, [<date when="1863-06-03">3 June 1863</date>]</corr></ref>), duke of Buccleuch&#x02019;s factor at Thornhill.</note> and <hi rend="italic">sent it back by his groom</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> to the effect that &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">Sandy Fergusson</hi> was to be made free of the woods and have leave to cut as many sticks as ever he pleased.&#x0201d;</p>

He kills their pigs for them; he prays with them in illness; and he <hi rend="italic">shaves their heads</hi>&#x02014;when <hi rend="italic">that&#x02019;s</hi> the thing in hand!!&#x0201d;</p>

I know [not]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> that by writing myself I can in any way better the matter; I might <hi rend="italic">worsen</hi> it more easily!

<p>I am not in worse health than usual (except for the unripe vegetables, <hi rend="italic">now</hi> nearly done!)&#x02014;but often enough in a gloom of spirits rather beyond common.

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>There won&#x02019;t be much peace for writing today. It is the day of the Thornhill cattle-show flower-show &#x26;c &#x26;c. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell is Secretary, a Judge, and what not?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> reported, <date when="1864-09-27">27 Sept.</date>: &#x0201c;The 27th annual exhibition of stock and dairy produce &#x02026; took place at Thornhill on Tuesday last &#x02026; .  As has always been the case at Thornhill, all the arrangements for the show were perfect, or nearly so, for which the secretary, Dr. Russell, and the committee of management are entitled to great praise.&#x0201d;</note> And D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, with his signal talent for being always <hi rend="italic">mal a-propos</hi> <pb id="pg-41-37" n="41:37"/><pb id="pg-41-38" n="41:38"/>arrived at breakfast time, just after the Doctor had left and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> still in bed&#x02014; He is gone after him to Thornhill. And D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell wont have a moment&#x02019;s time for him! so he will return here in the midst of my writing.</p>
<p>The Blue pill may be gazzetted a Bankrupt&#x02014;&#x0201c;no effects&#x0201d;&#x02014;good or bad&#x02014;&#x02014; Didn&#x02019;t I say he would interrupt me&#x02014; He is here again&#x02014;and gone to walk in the garden &#x0201c;till I have finished&#x0201d;&#x02014; &#x0201c;You will be done in a few minutes I suppose&#x0201d;!</p>
<p>When D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell told me he had written to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle that I had &#x0201c;kept my ground&#x0201d;&#x02014;I said; &#x0201c;God forgive you&#x0201d;! I meant that he didn&#x02019;t know the sort of wretched nights I was passing, or the misery I was enduring from the increased <hi rend="italic">irritation</hi>. I don&#x02019;t say much about my nights except to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. People get to be such bores with their &#x0201c;sleeplessness&#x0201d;! Most People thinking to themselves, like D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x02014;&#x0201c;Oh <hi rend="italic">perhaps you sleep more than you are aware</hi> of!! Why didn&#x02019;t you ring sooner for your breakfast, if you were <hi rend="small-caps">really</hi> all the night <hi rend="italic">awake</hi>&#x0201d;? And as to <hi rend="italic">the irritation</hi>; I am <hi rend="small-caps">ashamed</hi> to complain about that to a <hi rend="small-caps">man</hi>, more than I can possibly help, and the <hi rend="italic">positive fact</hi> that I have not lost flesh, but <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> gained, is there, to set against my unfavourable statements about myself.</p>
<p>I wish much for a little settled weather, and a little respite from <hi rend="italic">the</hi> misery, that I might <hi rend="italic">start</hi> on my journey at least, under favourable auspices.</p>

<p><salute>Oh my Dear!</salute> I should like so much to have something pleasant to tell you, in return for your nice little letters! But there is nothing new! no better night!&#x02014;no better day! neither am I worse;&#x02014;making allowance for the Colisynth<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x02019;s question mark. <hi rend="italic">Citrullus colocynthis</hi>, commonly known as colocynth, or bitter-apple; Mediterranean fruit used as a laxative.</note> pill, taken last night, to try and wake up the Blue-pill, unfortunately gone to sleep! I wish that when my education was going on there had been wise women appointed to give a course of lectures to young Ladies on <hi rend="small-caps">The Bowels</hi>! With all the wish in the world to pay the &#x0201c;particular attention&#x0201d; to them (the Bowels) which D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell recommends; I am so much in the dark as to the whole matter, that I don&#x02019;t know when to take physic and when to let it alone. When I came here first, I was nearly having an attack of jaundice, from the mistaken idea that these same perplexing bowels had returned to a state of primeval innocence! <hi rend="italic">Now</hi>, the new lights let in on me have not cleared my mind <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the subject, only unsettled and bewildered it! Medical Books, with the most fascinating Titles, lie <hi rend="italic">about</hi> in plenty; inviting me to inform myself about every mischance the Human Bowels and Human Body, generally, is exposed to. In old times I should have thought myself in clover as to &#x0201c;mental nourishment!&#x0201d;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210901-TC-JBW-01"><sic>1:382</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1821-09-01">1 Sept. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x02014; <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> I dare not&#x02014;touch one of these Books&#x02014;for &#x0201c;reasons which it may be interesting <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to state.&#x0201d;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:209</sic><corr>JWC&#x02019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10-31">31 Oct. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>And so I think perhaps that brace of pills had better have been let alone. But I was so anxious to try <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> to help <hi rend="italic">the irritation</hi>; both because it is an unendurable thing, and because it frightens me with respect to my <hi rend="italic">journey</hi>. When I <hi rend="italic">came</hi> from London I happened to have had a good sleep, and to be wonderfully delivered from the usual torment. I now only wait for some trifling improvement on my nights, and some consequent lessening of the misery by day, to set out&#x02014; But in any case I must return soon&#x02014;probably next week&#x02014; Tell Mary to sleep in my bed till I come and to put the wool mattrass uppermost.</p>
<p>The sun has just broke thro&#x02019; the clouds that have been dropping all morning! and I must go and hobble backwards and forwards a little on the gravel&#x02014; The sheep have to be &#x0201c;dipped&#x0201d; before we drive today.</p>

Please give the enclosed to Kate<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Amberley, [ca. <date when="1864-09-23">23 Sept. 1864</date>], referred to TC&#x02019;s letter to Kate, thanking TC for his &#x0201c;kind &#x26;beautiful letter to my dear Kate, whom I see you appreciate.&#x0201d;</note> &#x26;may she both be happy &#x26;deserve to be it<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amberley also wrote of his admiration for TC: &#x0201c;I have often hoped that my connection with the Stanleys might be a means of my becoming better acquainted with you, &#x26;perhaps I should hardly have ventured to address you in Rotten Row, had it not been for the consciousness that you would some day feel an interest in my name at least, if not in me. Pray do not think that you will have no more rides with Kate for I hope she will still be able to ride sometimes, &#x26;we should be very happy if you were ever to join us. &#x0002f; May I mention in concluding how large a debt I owe you already, seeing the intense delight with which I have studied your books, &#x26;the strengthening influence upon me of the many elevating thoughts I have found in them?&#x0201d;</note> (unless the &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">both</hi>,&#x0201d; which I believe, be a superfluous word.)</p>
<p>My news from the poor Wife are not so good altogether as when I saw you, rather a falling off, in the stormy wet weather they have had, wh the Doctor gives as the reason, denying any retrogression but admitting that there is almost no progress in the interior. So soon as the weather dries she is to return to me. I am kept in boundless hurry; struggling night &#x26;day, by all methods to have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with this millstone of a Book wh surely cannot now last much longer.</p>

<p>I had the pain of <hi rend="italic">excluding</hi> poor Farie last night; I knew his rap, and indeed was peremptory before that: &#x0201c;Nobody!&#x0201d; But poor wandering Farie really wishes well to both of us: in my loneliness here, it often seems to me as if there were nothing but nasty Organ-grinding, misguided-hostile, savage or indiff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> people round me from shore to shore!

<p>Only two lines today Dearest, to keep you from imagining worse than the fact. I am not matterially worse; but these pills are still worrying my inside, and I had that horrid neuralgic pain between back and breast during the night, and I got up exhausted instead of &#x0201c;refreshed,&#x0201d; and have been a long time about putting my clothes on. and have since had hot brandy and water, and my letter has to be written before our drive, and the carriage will be round in a few minutes. All which taken into consideration &#x26;c &#x26;c</p>
<p><pb id="pg-41-45" n="41:45"/>The inclosed letter from John<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1864-09-21">21 Sept.</date>, enclosing a list of various times: &#x0201c;You should allow me to go with you the whole way to London. Now that I have had time for consideration, I should feel very uneasy if you went alone, &#x26;in this I dare say D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and Mrs Russell would agree with me. I dont at all care for the fatigue of going on to London. Perhaps I might make a little tour to the Continent in October, instead of returning direct to Scotland; &#x26;London w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the place to start from. &#x0002f; It would surely be better to arrive in London in the forenoon, than late at night to run the risk of getting no sleep? And the four or five hours rest at Carlisle, with good supper &#x26;perhaps some sleep before starting for London, would make the journey comparatively easy; &#x26;the nights are not colder than the one we had in coming. Please consider the matter fully, &#x26;I shall be most ready to take any plan you think best.&#x0201d;</note> came this morning along with yours. I can&#x02019;t conceive what he means by saying it is no colder at nights <hi rend="italic">now</hi> than when we came down!

<p><salute>Oh my Dear! my Dear!</salute> Shall I never have anything good to tell you any more? The last night was perfectly awful! The <hi rend="italic">most</hi> wretched, I think, both bodily and mentally, that I have passed since I came here. It would be a consolation to have anything to blame. There was rain during our drive yesterday; but for weeks back there has hardly been a drive <hi rend="italic">without</hi> rain, more or less. Two Miss Wighams<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were four Whigham sisters: Mary, Jemima Lucy Maxwell, Georgina Helen, and Elizabeth, all living at Burnfoot, Sanquhar, Dumfriesshire.</note> came in the forenoon, and stayed dinner; but <hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> had no responsibility with them, and caring nothing about them; they neither agitated nor excited me. No&#x02014;I can give myself no reason. My illness is a thing which seems to set all <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> at defiance. Where there <hi rend="small-caps">is</hi> cause and effect to be discovered, the effect is always exactly <hi rend="italic">the opposite</hi> of what the cause was calculated to produce! So D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston said, and all of them!</p>
<p>There is a Lady<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> now living in the last house where I used to visit Lady Litton Bulwer,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Rosina Bulwer Lytton, b.

And all went on as with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>! only that she seems to have been a much stronger and more thick-skinned woman to begin with. I infer this from her being up to going to Hamburg by herself, in five months after her illness began&#x02014; I mean however to ask her to come and tell me all about it so soon as I am rested at Chelsea&#x02014; I was going to say &#x02018;at <hi rend="italic">home</hi>&#x02019;&#x02014;and the pen <hi rend="italic">scunnered at</hi> the word!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Don&#x02019;t mind if these poles and things shouldnt be ready, even when I come And don&#x02019;t let the maids be putting themselves in a fuss  there will be plenty of time after I am there.</p>
<p>I still aim at the end of next week&#x02014; It seems in vain waiting for any betterness (I seem to grow only the longer the more unfit.</p>
<p>I suppose I must accept John&#x02019;s offer.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I yesterday saw y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter to Jane; I find today she decides to accept y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> proferred assistance,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a very comfortable bit of news, among the others she sends wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are rather below average today.</p>
<p>I can give no advice ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the Trains, the Night-or-Day question, or any practical point at all: of course She, you, &#x26;Dr Russell will with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> best light consider all these things;&#x02014;and I need not advise you (what will double and treble the kindness, and is perhaps really the difficult part) to be gentle, <hi rend="italic">patient</hi>, patient, and <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> and yielding in all respects, as towards a creature <hi rend="italic">without skin</hi> in a manner! This you already well know, I am aware; and will, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> counsel of mine, do y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> very best in: it will be the greatest fav<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I can get at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> from anybody living.</p>
<p>I shall not grudge much y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> troublesome journey, if you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> really for the Continent. A day or two of you here will be a great treat to me, and I shall not grudge a little loss of time:&#x02014;before Winter quite come (before December <hi rend="italic">end</hi>, surely!) I shall be ready for any amount of roving and recreating, if things only go well!</p>
<p>Probably you may get this on Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>; at this hour, I figure you returning at 20 miles an hour over the ruck of Arrockstane:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

Sometimes I feel a deadly assurance that I am progressing towards just such another winter as the last! only what little courage and hope supported me in the beginning worn out now, and ground into dust, under long fiery suffering! D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell says, as D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> B<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Blakiston.</note> said, that &#x0201c;the <hi rend="italic">special misery</hi> will certainly wear itself out <hi rend="italic">in time</hi>; if I can only eat and keep up my strength, that it may not wear out <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.&#x0201d; But how keep up my strength without sleep? Oh dear! <hi rend="italic">you</hi> cannot help me tho&#x02019; you would! Nobody can help me! Only God&#x02014;and can I wonder if God take no heed of me, when I have all my life taken so little heed of Him!</p>
<p>John is coming today to settle about the journey. When I spoke so bravely about going alone I was much better than I am at present. I am up to nothing of the sort <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, and must be thankful for his escort&#x02014;the best that offers!&#x02014; He says Saturday is the best day&#x02014; But I don&#x02019;t incline to arriving on a Sunday morning; so I shall vote for Friday night. But you will hear from me again and again before then.</p>
<p>Of course they must get the spare bedroom ready and air the bed&#x02014; God help us</p>

<p><salute>Dearest&#x02014;</salute>you must be content with a very short letter. Two of the letters you inclosed were on business&#x02014;and have had to be answered and be hanged to them!

That matter settled, I have little strength for writing left; for the night was again dreadful bad! and in the early morning I had a spell of neuralgic pain, between back and breast, that left me, after an hour or two, <pb id="pg-41-52" n="41:52"/>smashed as if I had had a turn on the rack! <hi rend="italic">Now</hi>, it is out of my back, the pain, and has taken to my <hi rend="italic">knees</hi>; so that I cannot <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> at all!&#x02014;nice outlooks for my long journey!&#x02014; If the <hi rend="italic">special misery</hi> were driven out by these <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> pains, I would bless them! but it is not so!</p>
<p>John came yesterday, and it was settled that we should start on Friday evening.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for going by night rather than by day. The chief one which John does not know cannot be put on paper!</p>
<p>God bless you Dear! wish me well thro&#x02019; it&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> I need not bid you.&#x02014;</p>

<p>Again a night <hi rend="italic">absolutely</hi> sleepless, except for a little dozing between six and seven. There were no shooting pains to keep me awake last night; altho&#x02019; I felt <pb id="pg-41-54" n="41:54"/>terribly chill, in spite of a heap of blankets that kept me in a sweat; but it was a <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> sweat. I am very wretched today. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell handed me the other night a medical Book he was reading, open at the chapter on &#x02018;neuralgia,&#x02019; that I might read, for my practical information, a list of &#x0201c;counter-irritants.&#x0201d; I read a sentence or two more than was meant. ending with &#x0201c;this Lady was bent on self-destruction.&#x0201d; You may think it a strange comfort; but it was a sort of comfort to me to find, that my dreadful wretchedness was a not uncommon feature of my disease, and not merely an expression of individual cowardice.</p>
<p>Another strange comfort I take to myself under the present pressure of horrible nights. If I had continued up till now, to feel as much better as I did in the first weeks of my stay here; I should have dreaded the return to London as a sort of suicide. <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> I again want a change&#x02014;even <hi rend="italic">that</hi> change! there lies a <hi rend="italic">possibility</hi> at least of benefit in it; which I could not have admitted to myself had all gone on here as in the beginning.</p>
<p>I am very sorry for Lady Ashburton. Am afraid her health is irretrievably ruined.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201c;Is again in vigorous health&#x0201d; (TC&#x02019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:212).

<p><salute>Oh my own dear</salute> Suffering little Jeannie, y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter this morning is very sad, Not a wink of real sleep ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> for you! I read it with what kind of heart you may suppose,&#x02014;in the bright beautiful morning, even Margaretta Terrace looking wholesome and kind; while for poor <hi rend="italic">us</hi> there is nothing but restless pain &#x26;chagrin! And yet, Dearest, there is something in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Note wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is welcomer to me than anything I have yet had: a sound of <hi rend="italic">piety</hi>, of devout humiliat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and gentle <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> &#x26;submiss<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to The Highest; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> affects me much, and has a great comfort to me. Yes, poor Darling, this was wanted: proud stoicism you never failed in, nor do I want you to abate of it; but there is something beyond of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I believe you to have had too little. It softens the the<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word repeated at turn of page.</note> angry heart, and is far from <hi rend="italic">weakening</hi> it, nay is the final <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> of it, the format<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and nourishm<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of all real strength. I sympathise completely in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> two &#x0201c;strange comforts&#x0201d;; for they both <hi rend="italic">are</hi> comforts, each in its kind, and the <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> is in no small degree a comfort <hi rend="italic">here</hi> as well.

<p>This, then, is to be my last letter from <hi rend="italic">Here</hi>! <hi rend="italic">Where</hi> will the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> letter be from? or will there <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a <hi rend="italic">next</hi>?

<p>If I had trusted <hi rend="italic">my</hi> power of divination yesterday, I should have renounced all hope of seeing you this week. I had to go to bed at five in the afternoon. in a sort of nervous fever from want of sleep. <hi rend="italic">The irritation</hi> too unbearable! That clammy, deathly sweat, in which I had passed the previous night, as if I had been dipped in ice-water! then placed under a crushing weight of frozen blankets, seemed to have taken all warm life out of me. So I gave up, and went to bed. At night I took one of D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston&#x02019;s blue pills. (The larger doze had ceased to be beneficial)&#x02014;and&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">about</hi> twelve I fell asleep. thank God! and went on sleeping and waking till halfpast seven! It was <hi rend="italic">healing</hi> sleep, besides being a good deal of it! My first reflection this morning was; &#x0201c;And there are Beggars, nay there are Blackguards, or Both in one, who get every night of their lives far better sleep than even this, which is such an unspeakable mercy to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>! Ach! it is no discovery, that much in this world quite surpasses one&#x02019;s human comprehension!</p>
<p>I have been thrown out of my reckoning. I had calculated that on the principle of a bad night and a <hi rend="italic">less bad</hi>, the less bad would fall tonight, and I should have some sleep in me to start with. But <hi rend="small-caps">two</hi> waking nights coming together changes the order; and <hi rend="italic">to night</hi> in the course of nature (second nature) no rest is to be expected!</p>
<p>Tell Mary I now take coffee to breakfast, (John takes tea) and to have a little cream in the house that one may <hi rend="italic">fall soft</hi>.</p>
<p>And now goodby till we meet  oh that I had been a day and night&#x02014;(and the night a good one) in the House! no mortal can imagine the thoughts of my heart in returning <hi rend="italic">there</hi>,&#x02014;where I was <hi rend="italic">buried</hi> from! And my life still unrenewed!&#x02014;only the hope, often overcast, that it is in the way of being renewed.</p>

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>I had been long wondering at y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> silence; I little dreamt what the cause of it was,&#x02014;till Miss Bromley&#x02019;s Note my Wife got round to me! I have since questioned Miss B. once and ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>;&#x02014;yesterday, the last time, when her acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> was rather better. Nothing seriously wrong; but enough superficially to cause much misery; &#x0201c;gout-rheumatism&#x0201d; (or whatever they call it) and a great deal of chagrin. Oh dear, Oh dear: the ebullient effulgent Highland heart crushed down for the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> under these bad loads. My poor Wife is quite in alarm; and charges me to write. One word, one short word, if My Lady can muster spirit &#x26;strength.</p>
<p>The poor Wife is coming to me tomorrow; travels all night from midnight instant, my Brother escorting; due here tomorrow morning at 10! I confess I shudder at the enterprise: but they say it can be done, with care; and she herself wishes. For the last 4 weeks, since the weather broke, my news are much worse, or rather are <hi rend="italic">always</hi> worse, more or less; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> creates a great dispiritm<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in me: but I still believe (&#x26;even she does, as I see) that there is a great improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> since I last saw her.</p>
<p>At all moments I am either riding sleeping or else writing (and cobbling),&#x02014;all moments occupied, day or night, to get the Millstone filed from my neck! At this moment Horse <hi rend="italic">Noggs</hi> (so I call a self-willed little Horse, not vicious the least and willing to gallop into the Moon,&#x02014;Horse known to a cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Lady)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s gift of Noggs to TC, see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630517-TC-LLA-01"><sic>39:129&#x02013;30</sic><corr>TC to LLA, <date when="1863-05-17">17 May 1863</date></corr></ref>.</note> is waiting for me at the door.</p>
<p>Courage, courage, dear Friend; better days <hi rend="italic">are</hi> coming: <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the days are not <hi rend="italic">done</hi>!&#x02014; One word, if you can. <closer><salute>Yours sincerely</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

You, and dear D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell, for your goodness to me, your patience with me, and all the good you have done me! I am better aware <hi rend="italic">now</hi> how much I have <hi rend="italic">gained</hi> than I was <hi rend="italic">before</hi> this journey&#x02014;how much stronger I am, both in body and mind, than I was on my journey <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Scotland.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had traveled to Scotland overnight <date when="1864-07-13">13</date>&#x02013;<date when="1864-07-14">14 July.</date> see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640714-TC-JN-01"><sic>40:131</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1864-07-14">14 July</date></corr></ref>.</note> I felt no fatigue on the journey down, but I made up for it in nervous excitement! On the journey <hi rend="italic">up</hi>, all my nervousness was over when I had parted with <hi rend="italic">you two</hi>! Even when arrived at my own door (which I had always looked forward to as a most terrible moment, remembering the hearse-like fashion in which I was carried away from it)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC was driven away from Cheyne Row, <date when="1864-03-08">8 March</date>. in a special invalid carriage that looked like a hearse; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640309-TC-JWC-01"><sic>40:25&#x02013;26</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1864-03-09">9 March</date></corr></ref>.</note> I could possess my soul in quiet, and meet the excited people who rushed out to me, as gladly as if I had been returned from any ordinary pleasure-excursion! Very <hi rend="italic">excited</hi> <pb id="pg-41-59" n="41:59"/>people they were! D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had stupidly told his Brother he might look for us about ten, and as we did not arrive till half after eleven, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had settled it in his own mind, that I had been taken ill somewhere <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the road, and he was momentarily expecting a Telegram to say I was dead. So he rushed out in his dressing gown, and kissed me and <hi rend="italic">wept</hi> over me as I was in the act of getting down out of the cab! (much to the edification of the neighbours at their windows, I have no doubt) and then the Maids appeared behind him, looking <hi rend="italic">timidly</hi>, with flushed faces, and tears in <hi rend="small-caps">their</hi> eyes! and the little one (the cook)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary.</note> threw <hi rend="italic">her</hi> arms round my neck, and fell to kissing me in the open street; and the big one (the House maid)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen.</note> I had to kiss, that she might not be made <hi rend="italic">jealous</hi>, the first thing! They were all astonished at the improvement in my appearance. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has said again and again, that he would not have believed anyone who had sworn it to him, that I should return so changed for the better. Breakfast was presented to me, but tho&#x02019; I had still Holm hill things to eat I had not my Holm hill appetite to eat them with. All Saturday there was nothing I cared to swallow but Champagne (Lady Ashburton had sent me two dozen first rate, in the winter.) So I took the Blakiston bluepill that first night instead of the next as D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell had advised. and oh such a heavenly sleep I had! awoke only twice the whole night! It is worth while passing a whole night on the railway to get such blessed sleep the night after! Last night again I <hi rend="italic">slept</hi>&#x02014;not so well as the first night, of course; but wonderfully well for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. and this morning my breakfast was not contemptible. But it is a great hardship to have lost my warm milk in the morning&#x02014;I thought by paying an exorbitant price, it might have been obtained;&#x02014;but no! the stuff offered me yesterday at eight oclock, was impossible to swallow!&#x02014; And my poor &#x0201c;Bowels&#x0201d; perfectly bewildered by all the sudden changes put on them, don&#x02019;t seem to have any clear idea left, when to &#x02018;act&#x02019; or when to let it alone! so I am driven back into the valley of the shadow of <hi rend="italic">pills</hi>!</p>
<p>I had a two hours drive yesterday in Battersea Park and Clapham Common.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Battersea Park and Clapham Common, parkland areas S of the river Thames.</note> When one hasn&#x02019;t the Beauties of Nature,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-35/18590709-JWC-JGCO-01"><sic>35:139</sic><corr>JWC to JGCO, [<date when="1859-07-09">9 July 1859</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> one must content oneself with the Beauties of Art.</p>

Your own D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> sensible candid face was worth a hundred such faces as Simpsons, boiled down into <hi rend="italic">one</hi>&#x02014; And he has no more human feeling, that man, than a pig!

John brought her home to me again to this door&#x02014;by far the gladdest sight I shall ever see there, if gladness were the name of any sight now in store for me. A faint, kind, timid smile was on her face, as if afraid to believe fully; but the despair had vanished from her looks altogether, and she was brought back to me, my own again as before. &#x0002f; During all this black interval I had been continuing my &#x02018;comatose flight&#x02019; without intermission, and was not yet by four months got to land. To extraneous events my attention was momentary, if not extinct altogether; for months and years I had not written the smallest letter or note except on absolute compulsion. But here was an event extraneous to &#x02018;Frederick,&#x02019; which could not be extraneous to &#x02018;Frederick&#x02019;s&#x02019; biographer, never so worn out and crushed into stupefaction. This again awoke me into life and hope, into vivid and grateful recognition, and was again a light, or the sure promise of a light from above on my nigh desperate course. (Oh, what miserable inapplicable phrasing is this! or why speak of myself at all?) &#x0002f; My poor martyred darling continued to prosper here beyond my hopes&#x02014;far beyond her own; and in spite of utter weakness (which I never rightly saw) and of many fits of trouble, her life to the very end continued beautiful and hopeful to both of us&#x02014;to me more beautiful than I had ever seen it in her best days. Strange and precious to look back upon, those last eighteen months, as of a second youth (almost a second childhood with the wisdom and graces of old age), which by Heaven&#x02019;s great mercy were conceded her and me. In essentials never had she been so beautiful to me; never in my time been so happy&#x0201d; (TC&#x02019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:214&#x02013;15).</note> as per program: I was astonished to <pb id="pg-41-61" n="41:61"/>see the real and considerable improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in her since that dismal parting at St Leonards.

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>At Holm Hill at this hour I should have just drank my glass of wine and been sitting down at the dining-room table to write the daily letter to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C. The likest thing I can do here is to sit down at the Drawingroom table and write to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. I feel the same sort of responsibility for myself to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, as to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, and to you only, of all people alive! and feel too the same certainty of being read with anxious interest! Oh my dear Mary! It is an unspeakable blessing to have such a friend, as you are to me! Often when I have felt unusually free from my misery of late, it has seemed to me, that I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not be grateful enough to God for the mercy; unless <hi rend="italic">He</hi> inspired me with a spiritual gratitude, far above the poor tepid human gratitude I offered Him! And just so with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, I feel as if I needed Gods help to make me <hi rend="italic">humanly capable</hi> of the sort of sacred thankfulness I ought to feel for such a friend as yourself! I wanted to say to you, and your dear Husband, something like this when I came away. But words choked themselves in my throat at parting.</p>
<p>I have been wonderfully well since I came home&#x02014;have slept pretty well&#x02014;not as on the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> night&#x02014;(<hi rend="italic">that</hi> was sleep for only the <hi rend="italic">angels</hi>, and for the mortal who had travelled from three to four hundred miles thro&#x02019; the night!&#x02014;) but quite tolerably for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x02014;every night till the last. The last was very bad. But I have the comfort of being able to blame something for it&#x02014;and that something was my own imprudence. I wearied myself putting pictures to rights, which were hung up all crooked (D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell&#x02014;will sympathize with me); and then worried myself with the shortcomings of my large beautiful housemaid who justified (and more) all M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x02019;s tirades against her! This Creature with her goosishness and self-conceit is unendurable after little Mary.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Russell&#x02019;s maid.</note></p>
<p>Only think! I get my new milk again at eight as usual!! Our Rectors wife keeps a cow for her children,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Blunt, the Rev. Gerald Blunt, and Reginald and Elaine Mary Blunt.</note> and I have a key to their grounds, and going thro&#x02019; that way, it is not three minutes walk for my cook, to take a warm tumbler and fetch it back full of <hi rend="small-caps">real</hi> milk, milked into it there &#x26;then. I get plenty of cream, quite good&#x02014;paying for it exorbitantly, but no matter, so that I <hi rend="italic">get</hi> it. My eight stones eleven pounds and a half<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >123.5 lb. (56 kg.).</note> would soon have had a hole made in it without the milk &#x26;cream.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-41-64" n="41:64"/>I go out in a nice Brougham with a safe swift horse <hi rend="italic">whom I know</hi> every day from one till three&#x02014; And when I come in I have added your little tumbler full of excellent Champagne to the already liberal allowance of <hi rend="italic">drink</hi>!!! <hi rend="small-caps">it</hi><hi rend="italic"> </hi>is to make up for the difference in the purity of the <hi rend="italic">air</hi>!!&#x02014;</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I should have liked to give you another kiss, and my thanks and blessing by word of mouth; before going away again beyond all reach of personal communication. But the additional fatigue of going round by the Gill, and the additional agitation of taking a solemn leave, in circumstances so precarious, was not to be encountered voluntarily. I was terrified enough, as it was for the journey back, tho&#x02019; the same journey down had done me no harm. But nothing is ever so bad when it comes to reality, as one&#x02019;s cowardly imagination paints it before hand. I arrived quite safe, and the dreaded moment of reentering a house, which I had left in a sort of Hearse, with a firm conviction of returning no more, was tumbled head over heels by M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C rushing out into the street to meet me, in his Dressing gown and in violent agitation&#x02014;John having given him reason to expect us an hour and half earlier&#x02014; He had been momentarily expecting a telegram to say I had died on the road.</p>
<p>I got a heavenly sleep the first night after my return nothing like it since the first night I <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> at the Gill.</p>
<p>To expect the like of that to continue&#x02014;out of Heaven&#x02014;would have been too presumptuous! Still I have slept every night since <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> better than I was doing at Holm Hill. An immense mercy! if it were only for reconciling my imagination to <hi rend="italic">Home</hi>&#x02014;which I had got to shudder at! For the rest I have been wonderfully well&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">the irritation</hi> almost entirely in abeyance&#x02014; If it were <pb id="pg-41-65" n="41:65"/>not for my feeble, hobbling walk I might be taken for perfectly <hi rend="italic">well</hi>. Every body is astonished at me, and so glad and kind&#x02014;especially the men&#x02014; They take me in their arms most I have seen, and kiss me and&#x02014;burst into tears!! or are struck speechless&#x02014;</p>
<p>I remarked to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C that <hi rend="italic">women</hi> were always considered to have the tenderest hearts&#x02014;but George Cooke and Lord Haughton<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John George Cooke and Richard Monckton Milnes, Lord Houghton.</note> had embraced and kissed me with far most enthusiasm! He answered that &#x0201c;there was nothing very wonderful in that&#x02014;men have been understood to have more notion than women of kissing <hi rend="italic">women</hi> ever since the world began!</p>
<p>I will write soon again and tell you more particularly about us&#x02014; Today, and all days at present, I am struggling against accumulations of disorder&#x02014; Yes I should like &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">butter</hi>&#x0201d; very much&#x02014; Love to James&#x02014;I hope his back never troubles him<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary&#x02019;s husband, James, possibly hurt his back during the carriage accident in <date when="1864-07-00">July</date> while driving with JWC and Mary; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640719-JWC-TC-01"><sic>40:141</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-07-19">19 July</date>]</corr></ref>.</note></p>

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>Now that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has me here, before his eyes, in an upright posture, he considers it not only my business, but my wifely duty to answer all inquiries about me, myself.</p>
<p>I have then the melancholy pleasure of informing you and dear &#x0201c;small Individual,&#x0201d;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster&#x02019;s wife, Eliza.</note> that I am returned to this foggy scene of things with no intentions of further travels for the present. I not only &#x0201c;stood&#x0201d; the long night journey (they always bid me travel by night) very well; but, <hi rend="italic">as on</hi> the journey down, it procured me <hi rend="small-caps">one</hi> night of heavenly sleep; and as nervous illness is more <pb id="pg-41-73" n="41:73"/>benefited by <hi rend="italic">change</hi> than anything else, I felt, for the first week after my return, even better than in the first weeks of my stay in Scotland. The almost miraculous improvement is now wearing off. I have again miserable nights and plenty of pain <hi rend="italic">inter</hi>mittently. Still I am <hi rend="italic">a stone</hi> heavier (!) and in every way an improved woman from what I was when you <hi rend="italic">did not</hi> see me at Marina!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster hoped to visit JWC in <date when="1864-06-00">June</date> (see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640612-JWC-EFO-01"><sic>40:116</sic><corr>JWC to EFO, [<date when="1864-06-12">12 June</date>]</corr></ref>), but JWC was too ill; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640628-TC-LLA-01"><sic>40:123</sic><corr>TC to LLA, <date when="1864-06-28">28 June</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>

<p><salute>Dear Farie,&#x02014;</salute>Many thanks for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> diligence and despatch. Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> prospect of brougham and horse for us seems altogether good; and we will at once proceed to action upon y<hi rend="italic">r date</hi>.</p>
<p>The day after tomorrow (Jane, who is aways on the road by one o&#x02019;clock, fears you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have measure taken in time for <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi> itself),&#x02014;the day after tomorrow, i.e. Wednesday, she will (being once furnished with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> credentials &#x26;indications) drive up and herself <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the brougham &#x26;quadruped; her Driver too (who is Silvester our stable-keeper, a very honest rational man, and good judge both of horses &#x26;vehicles) will also see and examine; also perhaps, the Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Mr Blount<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, for Blunt.</note> our Parish rector will (who professes judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, and has offered help in the matter): if all these people had made up their minds and given their votes, the matter can be at once decided Yes or No. You have therefore to come down, <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>, if you will be so good, and leave with Jane y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> directions about all these preliminaries: after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> everything will go of its own accord. Tomorrow before <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, you will find her; or after 8 (say <hi rend="italic">at</hi> 8) tomorrow ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>.</p>
<p>In regard to the <hi rend="italic">vehicle</hi>, <hi rend="italic">she</hi> and her friendly advisers are the sole authority; if they like it, I like it, and all is done in regard to it. As to the <hi rend="italic">horse</hi>,&#x02014;I confess I have my misgivings; and wish <hi rend="italic">you</hi> who have good skill in such things, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self investigate farther. A good strong sound horse, <hi rend="italic">able</hi> for the carriage; that is the first point: but you know also I mean to ride the creature occasionally; therefore there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> points to be inquired into. If you suspect or dislike the horse actually offered, and know where to find a better at a better price, I shall by no means grudge the price.</p>
<p>In short do y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> best for us, dear Farie&#x02014;I am in such <hi rend="italic">hurry</hi> as is absolute frightful; and can say no more.</p>
<p>Silvester <hi rend="italic">drives</hi>; a driver &#x26;all arrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> are ready, so soon as a machine is.</p>

<p><salute>Dearest Darling!</salute> Why don&#x02019;t you write me a little word? I dont ask for a long letter&#x02014;like what you write to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Turnbul!!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> but just a line or two to break the strange silence fallen between us, so suddenly, thro the necessities of the case. It still feels strange&#x02014;and sad&#x02014;for me when Mary (not your Mary) brings me my warm milk, instead of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, and when, all thro the day, I miss your gentle ministrations. I should be too thankful that I get new milk at all, whoever brought by! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C says &#x0201c;it is little short of a daily recurring miracle!&#x0201d; At first they did not make haste enough, and the milk was pretty cold, and the froth fallen; but now it comes frothed up an inch above the tumbler. only it has not the sweet taste of milk made of grass. For cream I do pretty well. A hamper from Addiscombe (Lady Asburtons Farm) brings three times a week new laid eggs, sweet butter, and the thickest cream; besides vegetables and apples. Still, in spite of the similarity of diet, I am bothered about my&#x02014;bowels, which I look upon as a sort of sacred charge laid on me by you and the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>! Whether it be the change of air, or the hardness of the water, or some other cause I don&#x02019;t get on triumphantly on the voluntary principle,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561210-JWC-IC-01"><sic>32:48</sic><corr>JWC to IC, [<date when="1856-12-10">ca. 10 Dec. 1856</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> as I did for most part at Holme Hill (God bless it!) but have to take pills or bits of pills oftener than I like. But for all that, I am still feeling the benefit of <hi rend="italic">change</hi>. I have never had a whole night&#x02019;s sleep since the night after my return; but neither have I had a night wholly sleepless. I have fractions of sleep which pieced together make up an allowance that can be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with in default of better. And so <hi rend="italic">the irritation</hi> keeps moderate  I have found an excellent substitute for the nettles, one which will not fail me at any season or place&#x02014;a few drops of chloroform poured on a bit of web-sponge (I will inclose a bit to show you) produces exactly the sort of relief the nettles gave.</p>
<p>It is a wonder I have not been knocked up by the heaps of people who come, and make such rejoicing over me as if I were a queen bee! The social imprudences I have gone into or rather been forced into were wound up the other night to a climax. I had been several times &#x0201c;kissed and cried over&#x0201d; during the day, and I was not bound to sit up longer than was good for me with the two Confederate officers<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Reuben Thompson, journalist, in London to support the Confederate cause, and John Williams Walker Fearn, diplomatic representative sent to Europe by the Confederate state dept.</note> who came by appointment to tea. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C pours <pb id="pg-41-76" n="41:76"/>out the tea!! About nine I wanted to go away; but hadn&#x02019;t moral courage to hobble with my stick thro the room, and raise them all to their feet with &#x0201c;fears of intruding &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x0201d;&#x02014;so I sat on from minute to minute hoping <hi rend="italic">they</hi> might go away. At <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> a carriage dashed up and enter Lady Ashburton and Miss Baring<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa Baring, Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s sister-in-law. In an entry in his unpublished journal for <date when="1864-10-14">14 Oct.</date>, Thompson described the meeting with the Carlyles: &#x0201c;Drank tea and spent the evening (Fearn &#x26;I) with the great Thomas Carlyle at 5 G<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Cheyne Row&#x02014;Chelsea. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle, who has been for several months an invalid, made her appearance, an unusual thing, as we were told, and remained in the room all the evening. Lady Ashburton &#x26;Miss Baring came in after tea. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle said it was his habit to drink tea at the rate of 5 cups. He ran off into some delightful &#x02018;table-talk&#x02019; on tea and coffee&#x0201d; (MS: Univ. of Virginia).</note> who staid till eleven!! And then they all went, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C walking out with the Confederates.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thompson continued his description of the evening: &#x0201c;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle inquired about the Confederacy its resources, its army, its supplies of food, its powder, and read us a letter from R. W. Emerson in which the Yankee philosopher declared that the struggle going in America was the great Battle of Humanity. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle said he could make no sense of this at all. He amusingly referred to a Lady (M<hi rend="italic">rs.</hi> G[reenhow]&#x02014;) who had paid him a visit as &#x02018;a flamy, conspicuous sort of person,&#x02019; who had a &#x02018;notable song of a voice.&#x02019; When he rose to say good night, he called the Servant (a girl) for his coat &#x26;boots, (for he had received us in dressing gown &#x26;slippers) accepted a cigar which we offered him, and walked with us to within a stone&#x02019;s throw of the Grosvenor Hotel&#x02014;2 miles, at half past 11. On the way, passing Chelsea Hospital, he burst out into a beautiful tribute to Sir Christopher Wren, the architect. &#x02026; We mentioned Tennyson to him, &#x26;he spoke of him with great affection&#x02014;recognised in him some power. &#x02026; Thought Tennyson very greatly inferior to Burns&#x02014;but spoke of having known &#x02018;Alfred&#x02019; very intimately some years ago when he used to come in hob-nailed shoes &#x26;a rough coat to &#x02018;blow a cloud&#x02019; with him several evenings in the week. We talked of John Stuart Mill &#x26;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle said he thought Mill&#x02019;s book on Liberty the greatest nonsense he ever read, but that he had heard it was very popular in Russia! &#x02026; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle warmly invited us to come &#x26;see him again, said he should complete the &#x02018;Life of Frederick&#x02019; by Xmas, but that he was always at leisure in the evening. And so we parted&#x0201d; (MS: Univ. of Virginia; http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/collections/journals/text-context/cushman.html). TC also talked about Emerson&#x02019;s letter of <date when="1864-09-26">26 Sept.</date> to Moncure Conway who reported TC&#x02019;s comments: &#x0201c;&#x02018;I have tried to look into the middle of things in America, and I have seen a people cutting throats indefinitely to put the negro into a position for which all experience shows him unfit&#x02019;&#x0201d; (Conway, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 97).

<p><salute>Oh little woman!</salute> You will come to our aid, if <hi rend="italic">possible</hi>; but if impossible; what on Earth are we to do for Eggs? At this present, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is breakfasting on shop-eggs, and doesn&#x02019;t know it! and I am every morning expecting to hear in my bed an explosion over some one too far gone for his making himself an illusion about it. All the people who kept fowls round about having, the Maids say, during my absence ceased to keep them. And the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> eggs from Addiscombe three times a week are not enough for us both.

When I left Holme Hill M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell was in despair over her hens; <hi rend="italic">thirty</hi> of them yielded but three eggs a &#x02019;day. Yours too may have struck work. And in that case never mind. Only if you could send us some it would be a mercy</p>
<p>Only think of my getting <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, every morning, a tumbler of milk warm from the cow and all frothed up, just as at the Gill and at Holm Hill, to my infinite benefit. The stable fed cow does not give such delicious milk as those living on grass in the open air; but still it is milk without a drop of water or anything in it, and milked not five minutes before I drink it. Mr C says it is a daily recurring miracle. The miracle is worked by our Rector&#x02019;s wife who keeps two cows for her children, and she has kindly included <hi rend="italic">me</hi> as &#x0201c;the biggest and best Child&#x0201d;&#x02014;and with a key into their garden my Cook can run to their stable with a tumbler and be back at my bedside in ten minutes. Indeed it is impossible to tell who is kindest to me&#x02014;my fear is always that I shall be stifled with roses! they make so much of me, and I am so weak! The Countess of Airlie was kneeling beside my sofa yesterday embracing my feet!! and kissing my <pb id="pg-41-78" n="41:78"/>hands!!!

<p>All this time I have been keeping better&#x02014;getting some sleep&#x02014;not much nor good, but <hi rend="italic">some</hi>,&#x02014;better or worse, every night. And <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Irritation has been much subsided&#x02014; Yesterday afternoon and this afternoon it is troubling me more than usual. Perhaps the damp in the air has brought it on, or perhaps I have been overdone with people and things. I must be more careful. I have always a terrible consciousness at the bottom of my mind that at any moment, if God will, I may be flung back into the old agonies.

<p>I had found a Housemaid and engaged her&#x02014;her chief attraction for me being a certain similarity in her <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> to your Mary&#x02019;s; but she came, when I <pb id="pg-41-81" n="41:81"/>was calmly reposing on my oars and informed me she had the offer of another place which could be entered on immediately, and therefore preferable to mine which had to be waited for, thro Helen&#x02019;s &#x02018;<hi rend="small-caps">month</hi>&#x02019; of warning. When I saw what a bilious cowardly wretch she looked, in doing this thing which she knew to be wrong, I was rather glad to let her go. This morning the Rector&#x02019;s wife is to send me a woman of fifty to inspect, on the idea of making <hi rend="italic">her</hi> my Cook,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Eliza Warren, who remained at Cheyne Row until <date when="1866-07-00">July 1866</date>.</note> and Mary my present Cook to be Housemaid. I have a great distrust of women of fifty&#x02014;but we shall see.</p>
<p>The weather has been warm and moist&#x02014;often to the length of rain, to which I impute the loss of my appetite (<hi rend="italic">entirely</hi>) for some days last week and a backgoing<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anglicized form of <hi rend="italic">backgangin</hi>, <hi rend="italic">backgaun</hi>, Scots for relapse.</note> in several ways. In desperation at a ring, which <hi rend="italic">fitted</hi> me when I left Holmhill, dropping off my finger, I betook myself to the bottle of fluid quinine I had luckily brought away with me, and have taken it regular[l]y<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> twice a day, with good effects on my stomach I think, and with no bad effect on my sleep. Perhaps the air being so much more sluggish here, my brain is more difficult to excite. I mean to go on with it; so please ask the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to send me the prescription <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>. my bottle will not hold out above a couple of days, and I forget the proportions of quinine and water. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston wrote, as if in the spirit of prophecy, &#x0201c;should your appetite fail; don&#x02019;t forget to take the <hi rend="italic">Pepsine</hi>&#x0201d; But I never got any good of Pepsine and have always got good of quinine except for the effect real or imaginary on my sleep.</p>
<p>I am perfectly astonished at the impunity with which I do and suffer things that used to ruin me for days at St Leonards! Especially the talking in the evenings. I do not encourage anybody to come in the evening but cannot always keep people out without seeming too ungrateful. Lady Ashburton is still in town, and <hi rend="italic">She</hi> has come <hi rend="italic">three</hi> evenings last week, and last night Woolner the Sculptor came, just returned from his marriage tours with the graceful Lady who our Mary said &#x0201c;looked awful modest&#x0201d; (in Photograph).<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Russell&#x02019;s servant Mary; Woolner sent Alice Waugh&#x02019;s photograph for JWC in <date when="1864-08-00">Aug.</date><corr>,</corr> and TC forwarded it to Holmhill.</note> Woolner was especially <hi rend="italic">trying</hi>! for he dropt on his knees beside my sofa, and kissed me over and over, with a most stupendous beard! and a face wet with tears!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Woolner wrote to Emily Tennyson, <date when="1864-11-03">3 Nov.</date>: &#x0201c;I have seen Mrs. Carlyle &#x02026; and was charmed to find how well she was looking: she is too weak to do much more than stand upright; but her spirits are good and her state may almost be called a resurrection from the dead&#x0201d; (Woolner 255&#x02013;56).</note> I had seen him last on newyears evening, in my bed <hi rend="small-caps">dying</hi> as I thought! I had made M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C bring him, that I might bid him farewell, and he had then kissed my hand, and gone away with great sobs!

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>It was an immense comfort to receive the Eggs; but a comfort not without a pang! For although it was very pretty of you to send them in my own basket, it was a very great pity you did; the basket not holding anything like hay enough to preserve them whole! Oh my Dear! I am sorry to tell you how many of these precious eggs were smashed!&#x02014;something like a dozen! I would not indeed break your heart by telling you at all; if it were not, in prospect of future eggs, to prevent a recurrence of such disaster!</p>
<p>Depend upon it; all the new fangled ways of packing eggs, suggested to you, are downright nonsense! plenty of hay, and a paper round each egg is the only safe course. In spite of breakage, we shall now be able, with the <hi rend="italic">six</hi> weekly eggs from Addiscombe, and an occasional <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, dropt by an exceptional hen at the top of this street, to go on for some time. At the end of last week, we were <hi rend="italic">both</hi> put on shop eggs, and <hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> got one that turned me; and I didn&#x02019;t see very well what was going to become of me, there was so little in the shape of food I could swallow at the time&#x02014;I suppose it was biliousness, caused by the soft <hi rend="italic">muggy</hi> atmosphere that entirely took away my appetite&#x02014;. When a ring which had fitted me at Holm Hill dropt off my finger one morning, I thought it time to <hi rend="italic">do something</hi>; so I put myself on a course of Quinine which is doing me good. Last night however was a bad night, and today I am rather <hi rend="italic">waff</hi>.</p>
<p>D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle returned last evening from his long visit to the &#x02018;Jacks or Fletchers&#x02019;; and has established himself at his old lodgings,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle usually lodged with Mrs. Thirza Kingham, 48 Brompton Row.</note> where, he says, <pb id="pg-41-83" n="41:83"/>&#x0201c;he can sleep better than in that front bedroom of ours.&#x0201d; It is just as well so; for with the prospect of changing my Housemaid, and nobody now but myself to look after things; his staying here would have complicated my difficulties.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have been extremely hurried, with Proofsheets and <hi rend="italic">et-ceteras</hi>!</p>
<p>Accept many thanks for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> obliging Gift. Both Pieces are interesting, each an interest of its own. In the Verses, apart from their subject, I find a tone of great tenderness, and of a truthfulness wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> verses too often want. The Autograph has been carefully deposited, and is in a safe place, where it will be duly valued as the memento of a brave &#x26;good man.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thompson wrote to TC, <date when="1864-10-24">24 Oct.</date>: &#x0201c;Reverting to the conversation we had on the occasion of my visit with Captain Fearn to Cheyne Row, and the kind interest you manifested in the affairs of my unhappy country&#x02014;the Confederate States of America&#x02014;it has occurred to me that you would value an autograph letter [of <date when="1862-02-21">21 Feb. 1862</date>] of our lamented hero, &#x0201c;Stonewall&#x0201d; Jackson, and I therefore ask your acceptance of the one I send with this note. Written upon military business and dated from the Valley of Virginia, where his most brilliant campaigns were conducted, the letter has a certain historic significance.&#x0201d; Thompson also enclosed a &#x0201c;versified tribute&#x0201d; of his own to Gen. J. E. B. Stuart, hoping that &#x0201c;Some evening, when your pipe is aglow, you may find a moment to read the verses, and if they should reward the trouble of the reading, it will be a great satisfaction to one who is conscious of a heavy debt to you for many, many hours of delight derived from books of yours read on the farther shore of the Atlantic, before he had ever hoped to see your face.&#x0201d; Thomas Jonathan &#x0201c;Stonewall&#x0201d; Jackson (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x02013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>) and J.

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I sent you today the fullest accounts of that wretched M&#x000fc;ller trial;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The trial of Franz M&#x000fc;ller for the murder of Thomas Briggs, <date when="1864-07-09">9 July</date> was widely reported in the press.</note> and meant to supplement the newspapers with a letter. But a Madman (our former letter-Carrier<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Piper.</note> for twenty years) was let in to me, under the mixrepresentation that he had recovered his senses, and remained the whole hour between my leaving my bed-room and going out in the carriage; consulting me about getting a divorce from his wife,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Susan Piper.</note> whose &#x0201c;long tounge&#x0201d; was enough to &#x0201c;make him commit suicide.&#x0201d; I began to feel as if a corner of D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russells mantle had fallen on me!&#x02014; Poor man! he was a solid, industrious, religious obliging creature&#x02014;till five years ago when he became &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">filled with Devils</hi>&#x0201d; (as he <hi rend="italic">says</hi> himself) and attempted his Life in a most strangely shocking manner. and he told me today that twice since then he had tied himself by the neck at Hanwell.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hanwell Lunatic Asylum, Ealing, where Piper had been temporarily confined.</note> Not a pleasant morning-visitor! especially after &#x0201c;a bad night,&#x0201d; and with a threatening of sore-throat. I took <hi rend="small-caps">that</hi> yesterday, and thought I was <hi rend="italic">in</hi> for a severe cold&#x02014;but I am better rather since my drive; which was long today and in <hi rend="italic">the country</hi>. Yes! my Dear I saw fields of <hi rend="italic">sheep</hi>. not white but dirt-colour, and also, I saw a field with a charming lot of little black pigs in it! I am not tied to <hi rend="italic">two hours</hi> now for my drive, which was long enough to stay out in a &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">Fly</hi>&#x0201d; costing as it did six shillings! I have now set up a nice little Brougham, or <hi rend="italic">Clarence</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Clarence, a closed four-wheeled carriage with four seats inside, was similar to the Brougham, which had either four wheels and four seats or two wheels and two seats.</note> (as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> call it) all to myself&#x02014;with a smart grey horse and an elderly Driver<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> (in M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x02019;s old brown surtout)!!! I was at half a dozen coachmakers yards seeking that carriage!! examining with my own eyes, on my own legs!! of course I took <hi rend="italic">advice</hi> as to the <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> quality. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Farie and the Livery-Stable Man<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Silvester.</note> who has kept M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x02019;s horse these dozen years both approved my choice and considered it a great bargain&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">sixty pounds</hi> and perfectly new, and <hi rend="italic">handsome</hi> in a plain way.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201c;For years before this there had been talk from me of a brougham for her; to which she listened with a pleased look, but always in perfect silence. Latterly I had been more stringent and immediate upon it; and had not I been so smothered under &#x02018;Frederick,&#x02019; the poor little enterprise (finance now clearly permitting) would surely have been achieved. Alas, why was not it? That terrible street accident, for instance, might have been avoided. But she continued silent when I spoke or proposed, with a noble delicacy all her own; forbore to take the least step; would not even by a shake of the head, or the least twinkle of satire in her eyes, provoke me to take a step. Those &#x02018;hired flys,&#x02019; so many per week, which were my lazy <hi rend="italic">succedaneum</hi>, had to be almost forced upon her, and needed argument. It was in vain that I said (what was the exact truth), &#x02018;No wife in England deserves better to have a brougham from her husband, or is worthier to drive in it. Why won&#x02019;t you go and buy one at once?&#x02019; After her return to me the propriety and necessity was still more evident; but her answer still was (and I perceived would always be) that fine, childlike silence, grateful, pleased look, and no word spoken. &#x0002f; Whereupon at length&#x02014;what I ever since reckon among the chosen mercies of Heaven to me&#x02014;I did at last myself stir in the matter, and in a week or little more (she also, on sight of this, skilfully co-operating, advising me, as she well could) the long talked of was got done. God be for ever thanked that I did not loiter longer! She had infinite satisfaction in this poor gift; was boundlessly proud of it, as her husband&#x02019;s testimony to her; believed it to be the very saving of her, and the source of all the health she had, &#x26;c. &#x26;c. The noble little soul! So pitiful a bit of tribute from me, and to her it was richer than kingdoms&#x0201d; (TC&#x02019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:229&#x02013;30).

I send a shilling (in stamps) for the purpose&#x02014; But don&#x02019;t force her inclinations in the matter&#x02014;</p>
<p>My friend M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster was at M&#x000fc;ller&#x02019;s trial the last day&#x02014;saw him receive his sentence, and said he behaved very well. When the sentence was pronounced he merely bowed to the Judge and walked away with the Turnkey. But at the little door leading down from the Court he stopt and said to the Turnkey he wished to say a few words to the Judge, and the Turnkey led him back, and he said something which could not be heard, on account of his keeping his hand at his mouth&#x02014;to steady it&#x02014; Forster said the only sign of emotion he had given all thro the business was a quivering of his lips. When told to speak out, he removed his hand and said courteously to the Judge &#x0201c;I have had a most fair Trial! but I cannot help saying <hi rend="italic">some</hi> of the worst things said by the witnesses against me are gross falsehoods.&#x0201d; Then he seemed to break down and hurried out.</p>
<p>I am certain, had it not been that every Juryman felt his personal safety on the railway compromised by the acquittal of this man, he would not have been condemned to Death on the evidence. It is clear to everybody he had no <hi rend="italic">premeditation</hi> of murder and that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Briggs <hi rend="italic">threw himself</hi> out of the carriage, and <hi rend="italic">probably</hi> caused his own death thereby. The poor wretch returning from his visit to his &#x0201c;Unfortunate,&#x0201d; having <hi rend="italic">taken a second class</hi> ticket, had seen M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Briggs with his glittering watch chain get into the first-class carriage and jumped in after him, thinking that chain would take him to America. It was to take him to a far other land!<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >M&#x000fc;ller, a native of Cologne who worked as a tailor in London for several years, had recently lost his job, and wanted to go to America. He apparently followed Briggs, a chief clerk at Robarts Bank, Lombard St., into a first-class carriage at Fenchurch St. station, on the North London railway, assaulted him, and stole his gold watch and chain; Briggs was then either pushed out of or jumped from the train, and d. of his injuries. M&#x000fc;ller pawned the chain and went to New York, <date when="1864-07-16">16 July</date>. Identified by a coachman and a pawnbroker in London, he was extradited and brought back to England to stand trial; the watch and Briggs&#x02019;s hat were found in his luggage. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> carried a full account of the proceedings, <date when="1864-10-26">26</date>&#x02013;<date when="1864-10-31">31 Oct.</date>, which ended with a guilty verdict. M&#x000fc;ller was executed <date when="1864-11-14">14 Nov.</date> His &#x0201c;unfortunate&#x0201d; was Mary Anne Eldrid (or Eldred), a prostitute; M&#x000fc;ller went to see her on the night of the murder, but she had not been in.</note></p>
<p>Curious that he got off that night without the discovery of his ticket not being second class.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC means that M&#x000fc;ller&#x02019;s ticket was second class, not first class.</note> The Train had been very late, and contrary to all use and wont the tickets were not asked for in the carriages.</p>

    <p>I will write a few lines in spite of Blue-pill and bad Spirits. I have not been &ldquo;doing well&rdquo; since you left us, &ldquo;Anything <hi rend="small-caps">but</hi>,&rdquo; as the Housemaids say. I have caught some cold, (I don&rsquo;t know how or when) and this aggravates the sleeplessness, and aggravates the <hi rend="italic">Irritation</hi>, which has been the Torture and is still the Terror of my life.</p>
    <p>But I continue my daily Drives; only with greater precautions,&mdash;a <hi rend="italic">respirator</hi>

I have been so ill! I had gone and done the very thing your husband warned me <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to do! gone and caught a dreadful <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>! I dont know <hi rend="italic">how</hi>&#x02014;nor how long it was coming on&#x02014; I rather think the loss of appetite I complained of was just the first symptom of the <hi rend="italic">Cold</hi>. For the Quinine did no good, and then my throat got sore a little. <pb id="pg-41-92" n="41:92"/>And my bowels struck work&#x02014; Then a horrible pain began in my chest, and down into my stomach, and down down&#x02014;like the pain that used to pierce from my shoulder into my stomach during the night at Holm Hill&#x02014;but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> did not pass away soon, it lasted some twenty four hours&#x02014;in spite of mustard blisters, hot water,&#x02014;brandy and every thing I could think to try. And, as bad as the pain, was the nausea which made it <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> for me to swallow any earthly thing, except one tablespoonful of brandy in hot water, for six and thirty hours. My only consolation was, that except for the aggravation which feverishness is to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> pains, my special pain or <hi rend="italic">irritation</hi> was not increased&#x02014;</p>
<p>Now, had I sent for a London D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, he would have ordered me to keep my bed and take &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">draughts</hi>&#x02019; and devilries&#x02014;and Heaven knows what the end would have been. But I sent for nobody&#x02014;not indeed knowing whom to send for; now that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes is worse than dead<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Alfred Barnes was apparently suffering from dementia; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640628-TC-LLA-01"><sic>40:123</sic><corr>TC to LLA, <date when="1864-06-28">28 June</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x02014;and just prescribed for <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>, according to such lights as I possessed. In the beginning I took a four-grain blue pill&#x02014;then other physic as I clearly needed it&#x02014;and bearing in mind all the exhortations of both D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell and D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston about driving out every day, I actually did not miss one drive&#x02014;tho&#x02019; in horrible pain and one day <hi rend="italic">retching</hi> all the time!! I call <hi rend="italic">that</hi> energetic obedience to orders! But if I had <hi rend="small-caps">begun</hi> the shutting up system I should have had to lay my account with continuing it all winter&#x02014; My cold under this new treatment has run thro&#x02019; all the accustomed stages with a beautiful rapidity! I am now in the last stage, the <hi rend="italic">coughing</hi> stage&#x02014;and I rather think won&#x02019;t last long either. Tho&#x02019; eating far too little I dont feel <hi rend="italic">weakened</hi>. and the last two nights I have slept better than I was doing <hi rend="small-caps">before</hi> I caught Cold. I have not for years suffered so little from <hi rend="italic">nervousness</hi>&#x02014;unless one is to call that Irritation <hi rend="italic">nervousness</hi>. It is amazing to myself the agitations (or what would have been <hi rend="italic">agitations</hi> formerly) I can stand, without suffering from them after!&#x02014;</p>
<p>At the beginning of this cold, during the time I was constantly retching, and could swallow <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>; I got a <hi rend="italic">moral shock</hi> which would I think have <hi rend="italic">killed</hi> me at St Leonards. and all it <hi rend="italic">did</hi> to me, I think, was to astonish and disgust me! I told you I was parting with my big beautiful Housemaid because she was an incorrigible goose, and destructive and wasteful beyond all human endurance. As a specimen of the waste figure three pounds of fresh butter at 20 pence a pound regularly consumed in the <hi rend="italic">kitchen</hi>, and half a pound of tea at 4/ made away with in <hi rend="italic">four days</hi>!!&#x02014; Then, as a specimen of the destruction&#x02014;figure <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, <hi rend="italic">every one</hi>, of my beautiful fine&#x02014;and some of them quite <hi rend="italic">new</hi> table napkins, actually &#x0201c;worn out&#x0201d; of existence! Not a rag of them to be found and good sheets all in rags. besides a boiler <hi rend="italic">burst</hi>, a pumpwell gone irrecoverably <hi rend="italic">dry</hi>, a clock made to strike <hi rend="italic">fourteen</hi> every hour&#x02014;and all in the china and <pb id="pg-41-93" n="41:93"/>crokery in the house either disappeared or cracked! To be sure the Housemaid was not <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> to bear the blame of all the mischief&#x02014;and the Cook was to be held responsible for the waste of victuals at least  But Mary&#x02014;the one who attended me to St Leonards&#x02014;tho&#x02019; the slowest and stupidest of servants&#x02014;had so impressed me with the idea of her trustworthyness, and her devotion to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, that I could accuse <hi rend="italic">her</hi> of nothing but stupidity and culpable weakness in allowing the other girl, seven years her junior, to <hi rend="italic">rule</hi> even in the <hi rend="italic">Larder</hi>! Accordingly I engaged an elderly woman<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Warren; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641024-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1864-10-24">24 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> to be Cook and Housekeeper and Mary was to be Housemaid and wait on <hi rend="italic">me</hi> as usual&#x02014; Helen (the Housemaid) meanwhile took no steps about seeking a place, and when I urged her to do so&#x02014;declared she couldnt conceive <hi rend="italic">why</hi> I wanted to part with her! When I told her she was too destructive for my means, she answered excitedly; &#x0201c;Well! when <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am gone out of the House, and can&#x02019;t bear the blame of <hi rend="italic">everything</hi> any longer; you will <hi rend="italic">then</hi> find out who it is that makes away with the tea and the butter and all the things&#x0201d;! As there was no body <hi rend="italic">else</hi> to bear the blame but Mary&#x02014;and as I <hi rend="italic">trusted her</hi> implicitly; I thought no better of the girl for this attempt to clear herself at the expense of nobody knew who! especially as she would not explain when questioned. When I told slow innocent Mary she looked quite amazed and said, &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t think Helen knows what she is saying sometimes, she is very Strange!&#x0201d;</p>
<p>Well. Mary asked leave to go and see her family in Cambridgeshire before the new servant came home, and got it, tho very inconvenient to me.</p>
<p>When she took leave of me the night before starting she said in her half-articulate way &#x0201c;I shall be always wondering how you are, till I get back.&#x0201d; She was to be away near a week. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Southam who sat up at nights with me last winter, my Charlottes mother, came part of the day to help Helen. She is a silent woman, never meddling; so I was surprised when she said to me, while lighting my bedroom fire the day my cold was so bad. &#x0201c;Helen tells me, Mam, you are parting with her?&#x0201d;&#x02014; &#x0201c;Full time&#x0201d; said I &#x0201c;she is a perfect goose&#x0201d;&#x02014; &#x0201c;You know best Mam, returned the woman; but I always like ill too see the innocent suffering for the guilty.&#x0201d; &#x0201c;What <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you mean, I asked; who is the Innocent and who is the guilty?&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Well mam said the woman, it is known to all the neighbours round here&#x02014;you will be told some day,&#x02014;and if I dont tell you now; you will blame me for having let you be so deceived  Mary is the worst of Girls! She had an illegitimate child in your house on the 29<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of last July&#x02014; It was her <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Child<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude omitted from &#x0201c;She had an illegitimate child&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;second Child,&#x0201d; indicating the omission with ellipses (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:236).</note>&#x02014;and all the things you have been missing have been spent on her man and her friends  There has been constant company kept in your kitchen, since there was no fear of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> seeing it, and when ever Helen <pb id="pg-41-94" n="41:94"/>threatened to tell you she frightened her into silence by threats of poisoning <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, and cutting her own throat!![&#x0201d;]</p>
<p>Now my Dear if you had seen the creature Mary you would just as soon have suspected The Virgin Mary of such things! But I have investigated and find it all true&#x02014;for two years I have been cheated and made a fool of, and laughed at for my softness, by this half idiotic looking woman and while she was <hi rend="italic">crying</hi>, up in my room, moaning out; &#x0201c;what would become of her if I died?&#x0201d; and witnessing in me as sad a spectacle of human agony as could have been anywhere seen; she was giving suppers to men and women, downstairs laughing and <hi rend="italic">swearing</hi>, and&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; Oh I cant go on  It is too disgusting! I shall only say that while she was in labour in the small room at the end of the dining room, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle was taking tea in the dining room with Miss Jewsbury talking to him!!!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC mentioned Geraldine Jewsbury&#x02019;s visit, <date when="1864-07-29">29 July.</date> see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640801-TC-JWC-01"><sic>40:161</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1864-08-01">1 Aug.</date></corr></ref> Froude omitted from &#x0201c;I shall only say&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;way of interruptions,&#x0201d; without ellipses (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:237).</note>&#x02014; Just a thin small door between!

Imagine coming to the knowledge of all this when I was <hi rend="italic">retching</hi> at any rate!</p>
<p>Of course the wretch on her return <hi rend="italic">in a cab</hi> last Tuesday, bringing the wretched Boy-Father<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> along with her, in broad day light, to have his dinner, was met by a small packet containing her wages and the news &#x0201c;it was all found out.&#x0201d; She hurried the Papa into the Cab again and they drove off together!</p>
<p>But the Box&#x02014;I hope it will reach you safe. It contains what has a <hi rend="italic">grand sound</hi> a <hi rend="italic">real Indian</hi> Shawl!&#x02014; But I have doubts about its <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> as grand as it sounds! The <hi rend="italic">border</hi> is beautiful, I think, but the ground colour? Will <hi rend="italic">that</hi> be to your taste; yellow! I once heard you say you had something yellow that &#x0201c;you thought became you better than anything you ever had on and the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> detested it!&#x0201d; Well the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is at liberty to detest my shawl if he like, provided only <hi rend="italic">you</hi> find it becoming yourself!</p>
<p>It is near midday and I am not up yet&#x02014;have written this long letter in bed&#x02014;to be out of the way of interruptions</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>A good while ago I had in my hands an <hi rend="italic">Autograph of Fr</hi>h <hi rend="italic">the Great</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you had purchased, and wished to have <hi rend="italic">verified</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For a previous letter from Doeg to TC concerning Frederick, see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630121-TC-JN-01"><sic>39:33</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1863-01-21">21 Jan. 1863</date></corr></ref><sic>(where identified as a bookseller)</sic>; it was presumably around the same time, <date when="1863-01-00">Jan. 1863</date>, that Doeg sent Frederick&#x02019;s signature to TC for verification.</note> The signature I remember as particularly good, better than any I have seen: and repeatedly since I have had a tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of trying to find room for it (if not too difficult) in the last volume of my Book.</p>

Whether you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have the goodness to give me not only y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> permission, but a loan (for <hi rend="italic">two weeks</hi>, let us say) of the Autograph itself for that end?&#x02014;</p>
<p>By way of answer in case of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> compliance, be pleased to <hi rend="italic">send</hi> me the Autograph, as soon as possible (Monday morning is the soonest, I doubt).<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Doeg sent TC the autograph; for its reproduction, see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi>, 19:188.

<p>It will be a rather curious fatality, if after having assisted at a most diligent reading of the Latin volume<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ramage&#x02019;s companion anthology, <hi rend="italic">Beautiful Thoughts from Latin Authors</hi> (Liverpool, <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>); see also <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641125-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1864-11-25">25 Nov.</date>]</ref>.</note> by D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell, I am again to assist at as diligent a reading of the Greek volume by my Husband! But next time I shall have to deny myself the pleasure of making impertinent criticisms; as I don&#x02019;t happen to know a word of <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi>!</p>
<p>If I liked Nithsdale from of old, how must I <hi rend="italic">adore</hi> it now,  after having <pb id="pg-41-99" n="41:99"/>gained a whole stone of weight on my last visit, and shaken off so much of my terrible load of illness? I did not know all the good that D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell&#x02019;s skill and kindness, and his wife&#x02019;s angelic nursing had done me, till after my return to London; when I found myself falling naturally into old occupations, and feeling old interests that I had fancied myself shut out from for ever.</p>
<p>If it please God that I return to Holmhill another year; I hope to be more up to enjoying the sight of old Friends.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC visited Wallace Hall and Ramage with Mary Russell; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641219-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1864-12-19">19 Dec.</date>]</ref>.</note></p>

<p><salute>Oh my Darling!</salute> I should not be writing to <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi> this morning, with so many letters on my conscience which it is more my <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> tho&#x02019; not so much my <hi rend="italic">pleasure</hi> to write! But &#x0201c;Life is short&#x0201d;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Hippocrates, <hi rend="italic">Aphorisms</hi> 1.1.</note> and I feel that truth more poignantly than ever since this horrible illness; and I don&#x02019;t feel to <hi rend="italic">have time</hi> for always sacrificing my pleasure to my duty!! So the others must wait while I talk to you a bit.</p>
<p>The weather has been, as November weather always is here, horrible so raw and foggy and dyspiriting: nevertheless, I have not since my return to London, missed my drive a single day. It is the great support and comfort of my life, that movement thro the open air once a-day. Then it enables me to do my own shopping (at the carriage window) and to make visits (on the new principle of calling out the person visited, to sit in the carriage with me!). My back continuing as weak as ever, and making it too much fatigue for me to go up people&#x02019;s stairs and that sort of thing! When I have nothing particular to do in the streets, I know where to drive for a sight of <hi rend="italic">sheep</hi> (very dirty ones!) <pb id="pg-41-102" n="41:102"/>and green fields. I am out from one till about four generally! then I dine, and receive company till six.</p>
<p>Occasionally, not often, some one drops in to tea. but I seldom fail to be in bed by eleven,&#x02014;and still better, I seldom fail to get <hi rend="italic">some</hi> sleep. I have not lain awake a <hi rend="small-caps">whole</hi> <hi rend="italic">night</hi> since my return! Tho&#x02019; I am still far from sleeping like a human being!&#x02014; I take <hi rend="italic">pills</hi> at a great rate! Can&#x02019;t help myself. And no matter, so long as <hi rend="italic">the special misery</hi> keeps in abeyance.</p>
<p>I have been feeling myself very ungrateful in not going to report myself to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Richard Quain.</note> all this time. He was very kind and attentive to me last winter, and couldn&#x02019;t be persuaded ever to <hi rend="italic">take a</hi> fee! But now that the torment, which burnt up all delicacy in me, is abated, I &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">think shame</hi>&#x0201d;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:220</sic><corr>JWC&#x02019;s Journal, <date when="1855-11-21">21 Nov. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> to see him; after all the dreadful questions and answers that passed between us!</p>
<p>My new &#x0201c;Cook &#x26;<hi rend="italic">Housekeeper</hi>,&#x0201d; promises well. If I had not had another such <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> and <hi rend="italic">polite</hi> servant in the &#x0201c;Old Ann&#x0201d; who was with me six years,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201c;Old Ann&#x0201d; or Anne was a servant with the Carlyles from <date when="1853-10-00">Oct. 1853</date> to <date when="1858-03-00">March 1858</date>; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531012-TC-JCA-01"><sic>28:285</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1853-10-12">12 Oct. 1853</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540606-TC-JAC-01"><sic>29:113</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1854-06-06">6 June 1854</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580205-JWC-MR-01"><sic>33:177&#x02013;78</sic><corr>JWC to MR, [ca. <date when="1858-02-05">5 Feb. 1858</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> I should live in constant expectation of discovering some serious flaw in her! For this woman&#x02019;s characteristic is <hi rend="italic">plausibility</hi>, and I have a dread of plausible people! But probably as in &#x0201c;old Ann&#x0201d; there will be nothing to discover worse than a large amount of selfishness and an exaggerated idea of perquisites!&#x02014; The new &#x0201c;House <hi rend="italic">maid and Lady&#x02019;s maid</hi>&#x0201d; is to come on Tuesday. As &#x0201c;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren&#x0201d; (the Cook) said, &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">however</hi> she turns out, we cant well be worse off than we are at present.&#x0201d;</p>

Enough to say, you had not felt to have anything to write to me, in particular; or enough to say just nothing at all about it but when the Spirit <hi rend="italic">did</hi> move you, then rush right into the middle of Things!</p>
<p>As I shall do now. My Dear the most extraordinary things have Come to pass in this House!

But in the uncertainty as to when I should return, and in what state I should return, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C thought it best to <pb id="pg-41-104" n="41:104"/>struggle on as well as he could with the incorrigible Helen; threatening once a day at least, to &#x0201c;fling her out into the Street,&#x0201d; but never doing it! So on my return, the same <hi rend="italic">Two</hi> received me; Mary running out to embrace me in the open Street, and crying for joy to see me &#x0201c;so like myself again.&#x0201d; When I had rested, and to my own astonishment as well as the astonishment of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and everybody, found myself even better than I had been in Dumfriesshire, and capable of looking after my own affairs; I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> look after them, tried for two or three weeks patiently and strenuously to manipulate Helen into a bearable Housemaid, and failing utterly, gave her warning, not only there was no getting her to do her work like a civilized being but the destruction and waste in the House for all which she got the blame was intolerable. Imagine <hi rend="italic">four</hi> pounds of fresh butter at 20 pence a-pound consumed in the kitchen weekly! and half a pound of tea every four days!! It was too disgusting! So in spite of her extreme unwillingness to go, I engaged a woman of fifty (a widow) to be Cook &#x26;<hi rend="italic">Housekeeper</hi> and, Mary having shown such incapacity for <hi rend="italic">ruling</hi> was to try if she could <hi rend="italic">obey</hi>, in the position of Housemaid &#x26;<hi rend="italic">Ladys maid</hi>. This being settled, Mary got leave to go into Cambridgeshire (to see her Father &#x0201c;who had been dangerously ill&#x0201d;) for a week before Helen left and the new Cook came. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Southam (who <hi rend="italic">sat up</hi> with me all the last winter) was brought to assist Helen in Mary&#x02019;s absence. Mary had not been gone two days, when I was taken with a violent feverish cold; and in the first worst stage thereof I got a &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">moral shock</hi>,&#x02019; which affected me exactly like a blow with a stick on the pit of my stomach! making me <hi rend="italic">retch</hi> for half an hour, and so sick that for six and thirty hours I could swallow nothing but a tablespoonful of brandy in water!</p>
<p>This was the shock&#x02014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Southam being at my bedside, giving me some tea, said abruptly: &#x0201c;Helen tells me you are parting with her Mam?&#x0201d;&#x02014; &#x0201c;Yes, said I, and full time, she is a most unsatisfactory servant&#x0201d;&#x02014; &#x0201c;Well&#x02014;you know best Mam! But&#x02014;I never like to see the innocent suffering for the guilty&#x0201d;!&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">Who</hi> is innocent? and <hi rend="italic">who</hi> is guilty I asked in amaze; what <hi rend="italic">are</hi> you talking about?&#x0201d;&#x02014; &#x0201c;Well Mam, said the woman, it is pretty well known in the neighbourhood, and you are sure to find it out <hi rend="italic">some</hi> time, and then you would be angry at me if knowing it I had not told you&#x0201d;&#x02014; &#x0201c;Out with it for God&#x02019;s sake!&#x0201d; &#x0201c;It is <hi rend="italic">Mary</hi> Mam! Mary is just the worst girl that ever was in your House! While you were putting such trust in her, she was deceiving you in every way, and laughing at you for being so blind!! All the time you were ill, and all the time you were in Scotland she was having constant men in the House! fed at your expense! and even since you came home <hi rend="italic">The Father of her Child</hi> has pretty well <hi rend="italic">lived</hi> here.&#x0201d;&#x02014; &#x0201c;The <hi rend="italic">Father of her Child</hi>?&#x0201d; I repeated aghast&#x02014; &#x0201c;Yes; she bore a child in this house, soon after M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle returned from St Leonards, while M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle was sitting at tea with Miss Jewsbury!!! There wasn&#x02019;t a rag of clothing prepared for the Child. a woman was brought by Helen at two in the <pb id="pg-41-105" n="41:105"/>morning, and carried <hi rend="italic">It</hi> away in one of your blankets! But you will now understand the disappearance of all your small napery (!) and all the butter and tea and things that you complained of, and that were laid to Helen&#x0201d;!</p>
<p>Yes my Dear! this &#x0201c;insipid offspring&#x0201d; was born on the 29th of July three days after you left!! It is all true!&#x02014; I said to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Southam &#x0201c;Oh it is the treachery, the deceit that grieves me; I could have forgiven the <hi rend="italic">baby</hi>, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> might have been weakness <hi rend="italic">inexperience</hi>&#x0201d;&#x02014; &#x0201c;Well said M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Southam &#x0201c;inexperience&#x0201d; it couldn&#x02019;t be; for it was her <hi rend="small-caps">second</hi>!!&#x0201d;&#x02014; Every <hi rend="italic">particle</hi> of this I have had corroborated on undoubted authority! with oh such sickening details!</p>
<p>When the wretched little animal returned from Cambridgeshire, where she had gone to place her child with a married Sister; never going to her Father&#x02019;s at all! she drove up in a cab, at broad midday, with the Ex Boots (aged twenty) and was taking him in, to have his dinner comfortable, as usual; but Helen met her at the door with the wages due to to her, and the news that &#x0201c;it was all found out&#x0201d;!&#x02014; She looked horrified for a moment; and then said; &#x0201c;I knew I should be found out <hi rend="italic">some</hi> time, altho&#x02019; the Mistress <hi rend="italic">is</hi> such a simpleton!! and I don&#x02019;t care! I can get a place without a character from <hi rend="italic">Her</hi>! Come along <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi>! Get in!&#x0201d;&#x02014;and the two remounted into the Cab and drove off&#x02014;&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">Devilward</hi>!</p>
<p>Helen was kept on another month on trial, in the new conditions; with a superior servant over her; but it won&#x02019;t do! and we are to part tomorrow&#x02014;in perfect good humour! A woman of eight and twenty comes as Housemaid, of good family, and a good phisiognomy except for a too plaintive droop at the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>I have stood all this upturning wonderfully. Indeed I am not at all &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">nervous</hi>&#x02019; now tho&#x02019; the <hi rend="italic">special misery</hi>, is not altogether gone&#x02014;and tho&#x02019; my back is still so weak that I can walk no better&#x02014;hardly so well&#x02014;as at St Leonards!</p>
<p>I have got a nice little Brougham &#x0201c;all to myself&#x0201d; (as the children say) and a smart grey Horse, and a Paternal almost grand-paternal Coach-man! And I drive, in all weathers, from two to three hours daily; so I dont much miss the use of my <hi rend="italic">legs</hi>&#x02014;or rather <hi rend="italic">Back</hi>&#x02014;</p>
<p>People were so adorably kind to me when I reappeared! I never got myself so kissed and cried over in all my life! and that sort of thing does me no harm now&#x02014;rather it does me good! So you may conceive how wonderfully rehabilitated my nervous system is! I don&#x02019;t <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> yet like the rest of the world; but a degree better than in Dumfriesshire and several degrees better than at Marina. Oh Heavens! I shudder when I look back!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is extremely pleased to have me back, and in a comparitively efficient state! He hopes to finish his Book about new years day and then we propose going to Lady Ashburton in Devonshire. There is no one &#x0201c;with me&#x0201d;&#x02014; My Aunt in Law M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> George Welsh wished to come; but I did not feel to need anyone <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the House with so many visitors  Thanks to your Father love to him and Georgina <closer><salute>Your ever affectionate &#x0002f;</salute></closer>  <name>JC</name></p>

<p>I have been very much occupied of late weeks, with changes in the House &#x26;c &#x26;c. My days are so short to begin with! As I am still too weak for getting up before breakfast, it is near eleven always before I get into the Drawingroom; at half after twelve I go out for my drive, whatever weather it is, and am generally out for three hours. At four I dine, and receive visits&#x02014;till six. Then, in the evenings, I am too much wearied, to do anything but a little desultory reading. When I try writing letters in the evening, it never fails to give me a restless night, and now M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C won&#x02019;t suffer me to take a pen in hand.</p>
<p>Still it is not an unhappy Life. The <hi rend="italic">comparitive</hi> freedom from physical suffering, seems, after the long tortures I endured, positive enjoyment. And the pleasure I have in my friends is so enhanced by grateful remembrance of the kindness shown me thro&#x02019; the long period of my illness. And I am no longer <pb id="pg-41-108" n="41:108"/><pb id="pg-41-109" n="41:109"/>obliged to overexert myself, as I used to be. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has had such a fright, that it has developed in him a quite new faculty of <hi rend="italic">Consideration</hi>!</p>
<p>Did I mention in my last note that Mary the elder of my two servants, who had been with me two years,&#x02014;a slow and stupid Servant, but born with, and even cherished, for her trustworthyness, and affectionateness, and <hi rend="italic">distress</hi> about <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in my illness, so that she was taken to St Leonards and kept with me. the five months I staid there&#x02014; This Mary, while I was at Holmhill, about a week after my Husband returned from St Leonards <hi rend="italic">with</hi> the other Servant, took the liberty of giving birth to a child in the House! While M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C was entertaining Miss Jewsbury at tea!! She hadn&#x02019;t a rag of clothing prepared for it, so I suppose she had meant to make away with it. But the other Girl being present at the Birth, she had to let it be carried out of the House to nurse, in one of my blankets  The Father of her &#x0201c;insipid Offspring&#x0201d; was an Ex-<hi rend="italic">Boots</hi>, from a Hotel, age twenty, Mary being eight and twenty!&#x02014; This fact came to my knowledge when I was at the worst with my cold, two or three weeks ago; and not this fact only, but a great lot of the most disgusting details, which struck me like a blow on the breast with a stick, making me <hi rend="italic">retch</hi> for half an hour after! How she had been keeping the worst company in my kitchen, spending my substance on them all the time that my illness and absence made her safe from <hi rend="italic">my</hi> observation, and laughing at me as &#x0201c;a Simpleton&#x0201d; for my trust in her! <hi rend="italic">That</hi> was the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of it! She was turned off without notice; and the other girl went yesterday, not that there was any <hi rend="italic">vice</hi> in <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, altho&#x02019; she <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been drawn into making herself a party to the other&#x02019;s iniquities but she (the Housemaid) was a born blockhead, and the House could never have been restored to order with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> in it. Mary was a Baptist, and used always to keep her Bible, with a bunch of ornamental marks in it, on a chair at her bed-head!!</p>
<p>I have got a &#x0201c;respectable&#x0201d; widow, of fifty, for <hi rend="italic">Cook &#x26;Housekeeper</hi> (!) who has already done more for improving my appetite than all the Quinine and Pepsine that have been tried on me. There is never a speck of dust about this woman: and her manners are the perfection of courtliness! And, so far as I have seen things go on at less expense than formerly. If She only goes on as she has begun, I shall say I have lighted on &#x0201c;a treasure&#x0201d;&#x02014;at last!</p>
<p>The young Person (eight and twenty) who came yesterday, for Housemaid and <hi rend="italic">Ladys maid</hi> also promises excellently. She comes of an excellent family and I have great faith in breed. She &#x0201c;thoroughly understands her business&#x0201d;&#x02014;one can see <hi rend="italic">that</hi> the first day, and she is very modest, and intelligent and I should say from her face is not only <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> but <hi rend="italic">honourable</hi></p>
<p>So I feel myself set up in quite a magnificent style&#x02014;&#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">Housekeeper</hi>&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">Lady&#x02019;s maid</hi>&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">Coachman</hi>&#x0201d; coming every morning &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">for orders</hi>.&#x0201d;</p>
<p>I feel the comfort of all this better <hi rend="small-caps">now</hi>, than if it had come to me when <pb id="pg-41-110" n="41:110"/><pb id="pg-41-111" n="41:111"/>I was young and strong. As dear Betty<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid.</note> says &#x0201c;we hae mony mercies, may we be thankful&#x0201d;</p>
<p>I find I have written on a sheet destined for Madame Elise my beloved Dressmaker.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The start of a letter to Mme. Elise was on the reverse of the sheet on which JWC was writing this letter; only the dateline is readable, the rest has been scored out.</note> never mind!</p>
<p>My best Love to Elizabeth &#x26;Grace. Couldn&#x02019;t you persuade Elizabeth to send me <hi rend="italic">her</hi> photograph. the sitting one on metal is so ghastly<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the photograph of Elizabeth Welsh in vol. 3 of JWC&#x02019;s photograph albums; see <sic>opp.</sic><corr>above.</corr> TC wrote later underneath: &#x0201c;&#x02018;Aunt Elizabeth&#x02019; (still living; eldest of the Three).&#x0201d;</note></p>

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x02014;</salute>For a week past I have had one of the smallest of questions to ask you; and day after day in the whirl of hurries, it is lost. This day I go to <hi rend="italic">it</hi> before all else!</p>
<p>The question is, Has y<hi rend="italic">r Life of Goldsmith</hi> been translated into German?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster, <hi rend="italic">The Life and Adventures of Oliver Goldsmith</hi> (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>); there was apparently no German translation yet.</note> Or, more practically: Have <hi rend="italic">you</hi> ever heard of its being? Yes, or No: that is the whole matter.</p>
<p>It seems there is a German Lady, well qualified for such a task,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Agnes von Bohlen (ca. <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>&#x02013;<date when="1905-00-00">1905</date>), listed in the <date when="1871-00-00">1871</date> census as a German teacher living in Kensington; she had already pbd. an anthology, <hi rend="italic">Das Buch der Mutter f&#x000fc;r Haus und Erziehung Herausgegeben</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>).</note> who has decided on going forward with this Enterprise upon you, provided no other have yet done it. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> any other have done it, she thinks you must have heard. Neuberg, my faithful German, is the poor Lady&#x02019;s friend and sponsor; and I promised him to put the question;&#x02014;answer me, oh answer! I&#x02019;ll call thee King, Father, Royal Dane!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 1.4.</note>&#x02014;&#x02014;</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here are the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> referring to Scotsbrig James,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their nephew James Carlyle; the letters were probably copies of letters between William Baird &#x26;Co. and their agents in Liverpool, Messrs. Carnegy Davidson, concerning James Carlyle&#x02019;s search for work as a &#x0201c;sale clerk or shipping clerk&#x0201d; and James&#x02019;s reply to Carnegy Davidson, <date when="1864-11-21">21 Nov.</date>, which were attached to a letter from James to John A.

My impression is, that a <hi rend="italic">Factorage</hi> in Scotland w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be better than any outlook there is in Liverpool. If you will tell me H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Inglis&#x02019;s address,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

<p>My work is going on; but under endless haggles from toothache, from Printers, from mud, dyspepsia, dispirit<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c: I seem to myself nearly &#x0201c;over with <hi rend="italic">it</hi>&#x0201d; in more senses than one!</p>

<salute>&#x0201c;Dear John&#x0201d;</salute>
<p>I have been all my life under a fatality&#x02014;I mean one particular fatality&#x02014;this namely; to leave undone the things which I ought to have done;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Book of Common Prayer</hi>.</note> not thro&#x02019; <pb id="pg-41-114" n="41:114"/><pb id="pg-41-115" n="41:115"/>laziness, nor forgetfulness, nor perversity,&#x02014;the common reasons for human short-comings; but from a wish and intention to do the thing which I ought to do impossibly <hi rend="small-caps">well</hi>!</p>
<p>So it has been in acknowledging your letter and photograph.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the photograph of John Stodart in vol. 3 of JWC&#x02019;s photograph albums; see <sic>opp.</sic><corr>above.</corr></note> I should have done so in a reasonably short time, had not the idea come to me, to enhance my letter and make, what they call in Scotland &#x0201c;a suitable return,&#x0201d;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630129-JWC-JAD-01"><sic>39:40</sic><corr>JWC to JAD, [<date when="1863-01-29">29 Jan. 1863</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> by inclosing a photograph of myself, which you had not seen, and which would please you (I was sure) &#x0201c;for reasons which it may be interesting <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to state&#x0201d;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620905-JWC-TC-01"><sic>38:195</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-09-05">5 Sept. 1862</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> This &#x0201c;touching&#x0201d; likeness, however, was not in my possession, but in the Artist&#x02019;s;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Robert Tait who took many photographs of the Carlyles during his painting of <hi rend="italic">A Chelsea Interior</hi>, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x02013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580329-JWC-MR-01"><sic>33:197</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1858-03-29">29 March [1858]</date></corr></ref>; for a carte-de-visite of JWC from a photograph of that time, see 116; for the detail of <hi rend="italic">A Chelsea Interior</hi> showing JWC in the same chair, see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570811-TC-JAC-01"><sic>33:17</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1857-08-11">11 Aug. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> and altho&#x02019; I have applied for it several times, my <hi rend="italic">fatality</hi> has hitherto prevented my getting it; so I wait no longer, in case you begin to think ill of me, which at this time of day,&#x02014;after so many years of generous faith&#x02014;it would be a pity and a shame to do!</p>

<p>Ah yes! I have been dreadfully ill! I did not know that Life had in it such possibilities of suffering! For nearly a year I was in constant torture, in constant terror that the torture would drive me <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>, in constant expectation of Death as the only deliverance! And here I am after all, not only alive, and sane, but in rather better health and spirits than I had been for long, before my illness! I have done a good many strange things in the course of my life but this <hi rend="italic">recovering</hi> is the strangest thing of all!</p>
<p>Not that I am to be called <hi rend="italic">well</hi> even now&#x02014;my Back is so weak that I cannot walk six yards without being ready to sink, and I feel a constant tendency towards going on all fours! But then it is so long ago since I was <hi rend="italic">well</hi> that I dont remember the least in the world how it felt! and so don&#x02019;t pine after it!</p>
<p>For the rest, I am not unhappy; I believe in the Doctrine of <hi rend="italic">Compensations</hi>.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Emerson&#x02019;s essay &#x0201c;Compensation,&#x0201d; pbd. in Emerson&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> (<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>) 91&#x02013;127; TC wrote the preface to the English edn.

Then the People are so unspeakably kind to me since my return to the Land of the Living! I was never so kissed and cried over in all my life as in the first weeks after my Home-coming. <hi rend="italic">Men</hi> even, that I had not supposed to care twopence for me, clasped me to their &#x0201c;manly breasts,&#x0201d; and kissed me, and cried over me <pb id="pg-41-116" n="41:116"/><pb id="pg-41-117" n="41:117"/>like&#x02014; &#x02014;like anything!&#x02014; And my own Husband shared in the general enthusiasm and was become so <hi rend="italic">considerate</hi>! Bless him! He never bids me ring the bell now, without saying; &#x0201c;Oh I beg your pardon! I <hi rend="italic">forgot</hi>&#x0201d;!</p>
<p>Dear John! do you <hi rend="italic">never</hi> come to London now? I wish you would! I should like to see you again in this world; true friend that you are&#x02014;in spite of all your perverse ways!</p>
<p>God bless you. It is my hour for driving, and I live like an eight-day-clock</p>

<p>I had it in my mind, Dearest, to write you a nice long letter today, but the Fates willed that I should get up this morning late, and stupid; having had a worse night than usual. No wonder! considering the way I was used. I went yesterday to have a dress fitted on at Elise&#x02019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Madame Elise&#x02019;s shop was at 170 Regent St.</note> my black silk tunic which you liked so much, and which I have worn <hi rend="italic">every</hi> day and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> day since I left you! having fairly gone to <hi rend="small-caps">tatters</hi>&#x02014;and no shame to it! I was before the time of day for the fashionable Ladies, so Elise was disengaged and came to the fitting room herself, to superintend the process; which I don&#x02019;t believe she would have done for any <hi rend="italic">Duchess</hi> in the Land. And she <hi rend="small-caps">would</hi> <hi rend="italic">not</hi> let me have the thing done <hi rend="italic">any how</hi>, as I wanted&#x02014;saying to her French dress maker; &#x0201c;Because <hi rend="italic">Madame will not</hi> wear a crinoline and <hi rend="italic">will not</hi> be tied up; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is no reason why she should have no waist, and no style!&#x0201d; and so she fingered away at me herself, while I <hi rend="italic">stood</hi> for half an hour! Then she brought me a glass of wine, &#x0201c;to put away my fatigues&#x0201d;!! but it didn&#x02019;t! I went after to see Lady William Russell, who happened to be better up to talking than usual, poor Soul!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady William Russell suffered chronic ill health; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630100-JWC-LST-01"><sic>39:46&#x02013;47</sic><corr>JWC to LST, [late <date when="1863-01-00">Jan. 1863</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> and I couldn&#x02019;t get away from <hi rend="italic">her</hi> till within half an hour of my dinner time (four o&#x02019;clock)&#x02014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren (the new cook) never keeps me waiting; but my dinner was not well over till M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Twisselton<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Twistleton.</note> came, who staid till near seven; and between seven and eight, a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ballantyne<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Ballantyne.</note> came on the voluntary principle, and shortly after Colonel Cunningham, and Miss Cunningham <pb id="pg-41-118" n="41:118"/>(Allan&#x02019;s family)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Allan Cunningham&#x02019;s children, Col. Francis Cunningham and Mary Cunningham.</note> by appointment to tea. And just, I think, <hi rend="italic">because</hi> I was so feverishly tired, I thought fit to make tea myself! the first time these fifteen months! It was half after ten when they went away, and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x02019;s walk was not ended till near twelve. Of course I couldn&#x02019;t sleep, and when I <hi rend="small-caps">did</hi>, couldn&#x02019;t keep hold of sleep for many minutes together, and awoke finally for good at five. and such long dark mornings these are!</p>
<p>So I will put off the &#x0201c;nice long letter&#x0201d; till another more auspicious day, and just tell you how it is with me.</p>
<p>On the whole, I don&#x02019;t think I have lost ground. My cold is gone, a little tendency to cough and roughness of the throat&#x02014;but nothing to speak of. My appetite has improved since I had the new Cook, who makes every[th]ing <hi rend="italic">look</hi> nice, however it may taste, and who regulates my dinners according to &#x0201c;her own sweet will.&#x0201d;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. Wordsworth, &#x0201c;Composed upon Westminster Bridge&#x0201d; line 12.</note> Nothing so soon destroys all inclination for food in me as having to order it beforehand! So, reflecting that I was eating better I thought I might probably be gaining flesh again and yesterday summoned up resolution to go and be <hi rend="italic">weighed</hi>&#x02014;at the Green Grocer&#x02019;s<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Strange; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641031-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1864-10-31">31 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x02014;swung up in the air like a basket of potatoes! It wasn&#x02019;t half such pleasant weighing as Andrew&#x02019;s<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Hunter (b. ca. <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), plowman; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640822-JWC-TC-01"><sic>40:200</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-08-22">22 Aug.</date>]</corr></ref>.</note>&#x02014;nor was the result so pleasant&#x02014;I had lost <hi rend="italic">two pounds and a half</hi> since I was weighed last at dear Holmhill! Not much&#x02014;and the weight remaining 8 stones 9 pounds<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >121 lb. (55 kg.).</note> is fair enough for a woman of my inches. Still I should have liked to keep the &#x0201c;8 stones eleven and a half&#x0201d;&#x02014; When I came home after, I solemnly announced to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren, that she would have to fatten me to the extent of two pounds and a half&#x02014;whereupon she went and baked some sweet unwholesome biscuits, which gave me the heart-burn. For the rest; my <hi rend="italic">bowels</hi> continue very obstinate, and I take a pill or a bit of one every night. but this is <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> to me, so not to be complained of. I wish you would ask the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> if I should take anything for my water&#x02014; All thro&#x02019; my illness it was remarkable for having nothing earthly the matter with it (the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> said) But ever since I caught cold, tho&#x02019; the cold passed, it has been muddy with red sediment. Can the potash-water<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Potash water was used as a laxative and general remedy for indigestion.</note> which I take at dinner with wine, and at night with milk have anything to do with it? They prescribed potash-water for me when I was at the worst, and when my appetite failed thro my cold and the iniquities of Mary, I took to it with milk as the only thing I could swallow&#x02014;</p>
<p>My walking is as bad as ever&#x02014;constant weakness and aching at the bottom of my back. But I have had no neuralgia during the night&#x02014;except at the <pb id="pg-41-119" n="41:119"/>beginning of my cold. I am not at all <hi rend="italic">nervous</hi>. and I certainly sleep better than I did while with you, when I commit no indiscretions like last night&#x02019;s. Best of all, the special ailment&#x02014;the most unbearable&#x02014;continues much in abeyance. I never feel <hi rend="small-caps">quite right</hi>, never <hi rend="italic">forget</hi> my strange misery, never cease to have a secret dread of its bursting up again into the old tortures; but the <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> suffering if cleared of the aggravations of the Imagination&#x02014;would be nothing to make a fuss about&#x02014; Many people&#x02014;the greater number I believe&#x02014;have to suffer as much in some form or other! I dare say the exceptionalness of the form in my case has had a great deal to do with the unbearableness.</p>
<p>How is M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Menzies?<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Agnes Menzies, b. Elder (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x02013;<date when="1880-00-00">1880</date>), wife of Rev.

<p><salute>Oh my beautiful Darling!</salute> I do love you! With all my heart and more than all my strength, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> being small! And, to keep up a wholesome balance of feelings, I hate the Barings in the same degree!&#x02014;all except Louisa, who I believe <hi rend="italic">is</hi> true to you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s conflict with the Barings, see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640605-TC-LLA-01"><sic>40:113&#x02013;14</sic><corr>TC to LLA, <date when="1864-06-05">5 June</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I began a letter to tell you this, and some more, several days ago; but was interrupted; and then I waited till I had been to Wellbeck Street, to see the Bust, which Woolner had told me was much improved.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Woolner was sculpting a bust of Lord Ashburton; see Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 102.</note></p>
<p>I have now seen it, and can honestly say I think it <hi rend="italic">very</hi> like; quite a wonderful likeness considering the materials Woolner had to work from.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Woolner never met Lord Ashburton; starting the bust after Lord Ashburton&#x02019;s death, he worked from photographs and from the portrait by Edwin Landseer (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x02013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>; <ref target="volume-41/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15984"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); for Landseer&#x02019;s portrait, see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620702-JWC-TC-01"><sic>38:112&#x02013;13</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-07-02">2 July 1862</date>]</corr></ref>.</note>  I am <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> it is good! for I recognised in the brow and upper part of the face the same look of my Father which first attracted me to Lord Ashburton, and gave him a fascination for my eyes such as no other man&#x02019;s face ever had. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C too is now well pleased with the Bust. &#x0201c;Exactly the look he had when listening <pb id="pg-41-120" n="41:120"/>rather abstractedly to the talk going on in his presence.&#x0201d; It is certainly out of sight the best likeness of all you have got. Munro&#x02019;s Bust is quite contemptible beside it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Munro (<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x02013;<date when="1871-00-00">71</date>; <ref target="volume-41/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19545"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), sculptor; his bust of Lord Ashburton was exhibited at the Royal Academy in <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>; see Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 81.</note></p>
<p>Now of Miss Baring; what I wanted to tell you was this. Annie Farrer<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Annie Louisa Farrer (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x02013;<date when="1910-00-00">1910</date>), old friend of the Ashburtons; see <ref target="volume-38/ed-38-biographical-notes"><sic>38:279</sic><corr>38:biographical notes</corr></ref>.</note> came to see me after she had been visiting them, and got upon Emily&#x02019;s<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lydia Emily Baring, Lord Ashburton&#x02019;s youngest sister.</note> &#x0201c;perverse view&#x0201d; of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, I said I had never seen anyone in my life so prejudiced and ungrateful. &#x0201c;Well, said Annie; Louisa makes up for it! I never saw Louisa Baring so devoted to anybody in all my Life as she is to Lady Ashburton. You know, she is very undemonstrative, and she speaks of Lady A with enthusiasm,&#x02014;stands up for her thro&#x02019; thick and thin! And she is entirely in favour of The Will. She said to me, whom should a man leave his possessions to but his own child, and whom so fit to entrust that child to as the woman who had been everything to him and in whom he had the most perfect confidence&#x0201d;? I think you will be pleased to know this. I was.</p>
<p>Annie Farrer was also speaking of Venables&#x02019;s<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Stovin Venables.</note> &#x0201c;devotion to Lady Ashburton&#x0201d; (<hi rend="italic">you</hi>) She had met him somewhere and &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">My</hi> Word! said Annie, (her English is rather slip slop) isn&#x02019;t <hi rend="italic">he</hi> Loyal to Lady Ashburton? He won&#x02019;t suffer a breath against her&#x02014;is ready to massacre all the Barings for her sake!&#x0201d;</p>
<p>That also I liked to hear. Emily Baring has been in London some days, and was every day lunching with Annie Farrer&#x02014; She did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come to see <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x02014;as she always did on these short visits. And I took her avoidance as a compliment&#x02014;as a recognition of my belonging to the Enemy!</p>
<p>Annie said that Venables &#x0201c;would never marry Emily Baring if there wasn&#x02019;t another woman in the World!&#x0201d; that &#x0201c;at the time when they were wanting him to do it, he staid away from the Grange, and only went back when Lady A<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Harriet Ashburton.</note> gave up asking Emily to meet him.&#x0201d; Indeed Venables &#x0201c;had had a life-long engagement to Miss Lushington;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Maria Lushington (ca. <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x02013;<date when="1891-00-00">91</date>), sister of Venables&#x02019;s great friend, Henry Lushington (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x02013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>; <ref target="volume-41/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17211"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); see Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 106.</note> never carried out, for reasons known only to themselves.&#x0201d;</p>
<p>Oh my dearest Lady Ashburton don&#x02019;t let them trouble your heart,&#x02014;these mean people! Who are they? what is <hi rend="italic">their</hi> opinion worth? what would the deepest love, <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are capable of, be worth to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, that you should vex yourself at their enmity? All that was good and noble in the Baring family belonged to you, heart and soul,&#x02014;belongs to you still under new conditions; <pb id="pg-41-121" n="41:121"/>sweep the rest out of your Life, as you would the dross from which the gold had been shifted!</p>
<p>Up to the last week, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has held to his hope of getting done about new year&#x02019;s day&#x02014;and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> our going to you seemed a settled thing. And to me, this prospect has been a positive <hi rend="italic">physical</hi> support, as well as a mental one! The last two or three days some hitch has occurred in his work, and he is bilious, and despairing of all things&#x02014;of <hi rend="italic">getting done</hi> amongst the rest. I do believe I should <hi rend="italic">cry</hi>, like a Baby, if I am disappointed this time!</p>
<p>About the Horse?<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the horse (in fact a mare) which Lady Ashburton had given JWC for her brougham.</note> Let me know in time, what day he shall be sent off. To Bennet<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s groom.</note> still at your orders? If so, I suppose <hi rend="small-caps">he</hi> will come for him, and take charge of him; if not; Silvester will punctually fulfil your instructions  You will find him a most gentle, well-conditioned quadruped with quite speed enough for practical purposes.</p>
<p>I do not wonder that neither you nor the little Angel<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Florence Baring.</note> feel well just now. Everybody here is complaining of weakness, sometimes to the extent of Diarrhea owing to the damp airless weather. But <hi rend="italic">that</hi> cannot last for ever.</p>
<p>I enclose a letter from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Oliphant Author of <hi rend="italic">Edward Irvings Life, The Chronicles of Carlingford</hi>, and many pleasant novels<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margarent Oliphant&#x02019;s most recent novel was <hi rend="italic">The Perpetual Curate</hi> (Edinburgh and London, <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>); see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641209-JWC-MO-01">JWC to MO, <date when="1864-12-09">9 Dec.</date></ref></note>&#x02014; It will interest you.

<salute>Dear Inglis,</salute>
<p>It is many a year since you heard of me;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The last recorded meeting of TC and Inglis was by chance in George St., Edinburgh, <date when="1859-09-00">Sept. 1859</date>; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590909-TC-JWC-01"><sic>35:196</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1859-09-09">9 Sept. 1859</date></corr></ref>; Inglis&#x02019;s last recorded visit to Cheyne Row was in <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540210-TC-JAC-01"><sic>29:29</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1854-02-10">10 Feb. 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note> and I now come begging: but I know you will permit me willingly; &#x26;listen to my request so far as you can. The case is this.</p>
<p>A Brother&#x02019;s Son of mine,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle Jr.; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641202-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1864-12-02">2 Dec.</date></ref></note> a respectable and likely enough young man of 29, who does not want for natural faculty, and I believe has qualified himself in some reasonable degree for the business of <hi rend="italic">Factorage</hi> (as we Scotch call it) or the management of Land,&#x02014;is considerably in want of some employment in that line. You have, as is well known, a great deal to do with Landed Estates; and must often be called upon to appoint or recommend qualified persons as Factors or Managers. Now if you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have the kindness to investigate this young man, and satisfy yourself ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> his fitness,&#x02014;if you found him really <hi rend="italic">fit</hi>, and happened to have before long a place fit, I shall only say you could do me, thro&#x02019; him, a very great favour.</p>
<p>Another Brother of mine (John, whom you have heard of) who is equally interested in the case, and knows it better, has written down the inclosed particulars about it;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley,</salute>
<p>You are very kind to me; and had not I been, ever since y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Note came, the most hurried and bothered of mankind, you need not doubt but I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have thanked you sooner.</p>
<p>There are few places in the world I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like better to see ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> than Alderley House<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC last visited Alderley <date when="1859-09-00">Sept. 1859</date>; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590929-JWC-TC-01"><sic>35:222</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1859-09-29">29 Sept. 1859</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> with its pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> inhabitants. But as to this Winter,&#x02014;alas, my unfortunate Book will not finish till well on in jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi>, at the very soonest and best: and so soon as the Book ends, or even as I can <hi rend="italic">carry</hi> the end of it with me (to work at it away from home), Wife and I are due at Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s Seaside Cottage (South, in Devonshire or the border of Dorsetshire)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seaforth Lodge, nr. Seaton, Devon.</note> for I know not what length of weeks. So that as to the <hi rend="italic">North</hi>&#x02014;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alderley is in Cheshire, in the north of England.</note></p>
<p>Nevertheless my tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> do gravitate that way, as may be fancied; I have not seen my poor old Scotland &#x26;birthland for four years,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC last visited Scotland <date when="1860-09-00">Sept. 1860</date>; see vol. 36.</note>&#x02014;a kind of <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> &#x0201c;<hi rend="small-caps">threap</hi>&#x0201d; dwelling in me that I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> finish the Book, <hi rend="italic">first</hi>:&#x02014;&#x02014;I am steady in the hope, therefore, that there is a good time coming to me from the North Quarter too.</p>
<p>Poor Lord Carlisle,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George William Frederick Howard, 7th earl of Carlisle, politician; he d., <date when="1864-12-05">5 Dec.</date>, at Castle Howard, Yorkshire.</note>&#x02014;gone the way we have all to go! He was an innocent-hearted man as I ever knew or saw.</p>
<p>Some rumour reaches me that Lyulph is for <hi rend="italic">printing</hi> his late American Letters. Tell him &#x0201c;not to.&#x0201d; He will himself be strongly of that opin<hi rend="italic">n</hi> ten years hence.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Lyulph Stanley recently visited the U.S.; TC gave him a letter of introduction to Emerson, who was very impressed by him; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641012-JWC-LLA-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, [<date when="1864-10-12">12 Oct.</date>]</ref>. He apparently did not publish the letters.</note></p>
<p>My Wife keeps wonderfully well considering; I myself <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> furiously for life,&#x02014;and am pretty considerably <hi rend="italic">killt</hi> by these 12 years of digging in the quicksilver mines.

My last news was your own letter from Scotland, which reached me when I was already too ill and spiritless for answering it; tho&#x02019; I did not suspect <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, that it was a worse illness than <hi rend="italic">usual</hi>, and was to last a whole year, and was to bring me to the point of Death. All the four months I was confined to bed at home, and the five months I was being doctored at St Leonards, I had hardly more communication with the outer world than if I had been buried. I could carry on no correspondences, could see no people; it took just every morsel of strength I had, to <hi rend="italic">keep living</hi>, and to <hi rend="italic">keep my senses</hi>!&#x02014; My nervous sufferings were so terrible! In the middle of July, no <hi rend="small-caps">sleep</hi> being attainable at St Leonards, I had an inspiration of Heaven to rush off to Scotland <hi rend="italic">whether I</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">could</hi> <hi rend="italic">or not</hi>! I went by night, with the escort of my medical Brotherinlaw, and the night after I <hi rend="italic">slept</hi>! I staid about three months with dear friends I have in Dumfriesshire, the master of the House the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I know, and the mistress the best nurse! I had fallen on my feet! I gained a whole stone&#x02019;s weight there, and some strength, and <hi rend="italic">some</hi> hope, and my <hi rend="italic">special torture</hi> fell into abeyance&#x02014;comparitively! When I returned to Cheyne Row in the beginning of October, I was astonished to find myself able to lead something like my old life&#x02014;-<hi rend="italic">outwardly</hi> at least! I cannot <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> yet many yards without being ready to sink; but I drive out some three hours every day; my Husband having given me a little Brougham and Horse and Driver &#x0201c;all to myself.&#x0201d; We have few mutual friends here you and I; I could hear nothing of you; so I thought the surest way would be to go to Ealing<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ealing, now a suburb, then a village about 6 mi.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here from H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Inglis is a Note,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Inglis wrote, <date when="1864-12-14">14 Dec.</date>: &#x0201c;It is superfluous to say that I was glad to hear from you; or that anything I can do in the matter of your nephew, is most heartily at your service.&#x02014; At present, I know of no opening; but should such occur either in my own path, or in any I can influence, you may rely on my utmost exertions.&#x02014; Meantime, my friend D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Brown has written to a friend of his, a Sir Walter Trevelyan, on the subject; with what success, we shall see.&#x0201d; He asked TC and JWC (&#x0201c;to whom my kindest regards&#x0201d;) to visit him in the summer at his home in the country, 25 mi. (40 km.) from Edinburgh, &#x0201c;amongst the hills which gird Gala-water;&#x02014;where you will find tea, tobacco, and welcome. I look upon your consent as an accomplished fact.&#x0201d; He wrote that he was &#x0201c;seldom now in London; but should I chance to be there, I shall not fail in my homage to the Goethe of Chelsea.&#x0201d;</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> came yesterday morning; to wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I send no ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi>,&#x02014;but you, if you happened to see him on the streets (for he <pb id="pg-41-128" n="41:128"/>knows you by face &#x26;name, and his tone here &#x26;always is kind), might stop him &#x26;say the civilities (I much obliged, dreadfully busy &#x26;c);&#x02014;I suppose, how<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, he will really do what<hi rend="italic">r</hi> he can: so if you dislike, don&#x02019;t. There seems to be nothing open, or practically visible: Jamie will have to wait.

<p>I was very wae to think of you packing off for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>;&#x02014;a world growing cold and empty to us both: but we must not complain.

She has had no speech of your father for a long while, &#x26;is always one of the best of sisters&#x0201d; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086). John had apparently just returned to Edinburgh from visiting Jean at Dumfries.</note></p>
<p>I am sadly beclouded and loaded under this weather,&#x02014;wild long rides indispensable, tho&#x02019; hateful &#x26;c.

<p>Jane drives daily.

<salute>Dearest Friend</salute>
<p>If it is as cold, and snows as hard <hi rend="italic">there</hi> as <hi rend="italic">here</hi>: you will be fancying me broken down, if I don&#x02019;t write, and tell you I am taking all that very easily! driving out every day from two to three hours&#x02014;as usual!! The cold is not so trying for me as the damp, I find. My Horse has not stood it nearly so well! I had him <pb id="pg-41-129" n="41:129"/><hi rend="italic">roughened</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Studs were screwed to horses&#x02019; shoes to prevent them slipping on the ice; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601221-TC-JAC-01"><sic>37:67</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1860-12-21">21 Dec. 1860</date></corr></ref>. JWC still referred to the horse as &#x0201c;he&#x0201d; although she was a mare.</note> the first day of the frost and snow, but nevertheless he managed to get a strain in one of his hind legs; and is now in great trouble poor Beast! with a Farrier attending him, and his leg &#x0201c;swollen awful&#x0201d;! He is a beautiful grey Horse, given me whether I would or no by Lady Ashburton; but young, and I am afraid too <hi rend="italic">sensitive</hi> for this world! &#x0201c;Whenever he is the least put out of his way, he goes off his food&#x0201d;; the groom says.&#x02014; Nobody can say <hi rend="italic">when</hi> he will be fit for work again&#x02014;if ever&#x02014; Meanwhile I get a horse from the Livery Stables.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Silvester&#x02019;s, Church St.</note></p>
<p>I should be glad to hear that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had no misadventure with that horse you were <hi rend="italic">trying</hi>! It was a piece of conjugal obedience, I am far from feeling myself up to, to go out with a new horse to <hi rend="small-caps">try</hi> it! What a gay life you seem to be leading, now that you have not the <hi rend="small-caps">tie</hi> of <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to keep you at home! I should fret myself over the recollection how many invitations you refused on my account, if I did not also recollect that you had <hi rend="italic">no</hi> &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">cold</hi>&#x0201d; nor illness of any sort, and slept always <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, all the time, while you were taking regular drives and keeping out of <hi rend="italic">parties</hi>!&#x02014; But that doesn&#x02019;t lessen my sense of your self-sacrificing goodness, and the Doctor&#x02019;s! Often after it has come into my head, and brought a glow into my heart, and almost tears into my eyes, about that&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">clock</hi>! The thought of its <hi rend="italic">standing</hi> for so many weeks, in the lobby, where it was ever in view&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">standing</hi>&#x02014;!! Many people might have stopt a clock for me, and I should have thought it such a wonderful kindness. But D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell&#x02014;he who is so correct about everything&#x02014;who has a constitutional need of seeing everything in its proper place and discharging its proper functions&#x02014;for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to turn his clock into a practical solecism, in consideration of my nervous fancy which he could not be expected to <hi rend="italic">understand</hi>&#x02014;! indeed it was a piece of hospitality and human kindness <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, which I shall never forget to be grateful for!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Russell apparently silenced the clock so that JWC would not be disturbed by its striking during the night.</note></p>
<p>I meant to have had the poor clock set a-going, just the last thing <hi rend="italic">before</hi> I came away. But the shock of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Bairds<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Baird; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641003-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1864-10-03">3 Oct.</date></ref></note> death made me forget several things&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> amongst them.</p>
<p>The most spirited thing I have done since you last heard of me was driving to Acton with&#x02014;&#x02014;Madame Elise!! to see her beautiful place<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Madame Elise lived at Hill House, Acton.</note> there and take a dinner-tea with her, and back with her&#x02014;arriving at home as late as six o&#x02019;clock!!</p>
<p>It was a pleasant little excursion, Elise <hi rend="italic">as a woman</hi>, with a House and children, is charming. It is a magnificent House, with a dining room about <hi rend="italic">three</hi> <pb id="pg-41-130" n="41:130"/><pb id="pg-41-131" n="41:131"/>times the size of the Wallace Hall<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The home of Craufurd Tait Ramage; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641123-JWC-CTR-01">JWC to CTR, <date when="1864-11-23">23 Nov.</date></ref></note> dining room, and a drawing-room to match.

<p>A middle-aged Ladylike governess<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> took charge of the three children, perfect little Beauties!<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick, Violet, and Rudolph.</note> and the nurse and other maids<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> had the air of a &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">Great Family</hi>&#x02019; about them! They all treated &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">Madame</hi>&#x02019; as if she had been a Princess!&#x02014;a triumph of <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi>!</p>
<p>The only drawback to my satisfaction, was a dread of catching cold. The immense rooms had immense fires in them. But their size and the knowledge that they were only lived in from Saturday till Monday, in a general way, gave me a sensation of <hi rend="italic">chill</hi>; and then being abroad so late at this season was very imprudent. I went to bed with a pain in my shoulder and much self-upbraiding. But got some sleep and no harm was done.</p>
<p>Do you know that bottle of whisky you gave me has been of the greatest use! Things affect one so differently at different times! Whisky seemed to fever me at Holmhill. <hi rend="italic">Here</hi> it <hi rend="italic">calms</hi> me and helps me to sleep! I take a tablespoonful <hi rend="italic">raw</hi> when I get desperate about sleeping&#x02014;and invariably <hi rend="italic">hitherto</hi> with good effect. I take no quinine nor other medicine at present except the apperient<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, for aperient.</note> pills. half a one I have to take every night. The potash water I like very much with my wine and my milk; and take from one to two bottles of it every day,</p>
<p>I have not been weighed again but I don&#x02019;t thing<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> I can have lost any more, as I eat better since the new Cook took me in hand. She continues to be a <pb id="pg-41-132" n="41:132"/>most comfortable servant. Such courtesy! such equability of temper! Such obligingness, and <hi rend="italic">all that</hi> so cheap! for the weekly bills are <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than when I had ignorant servants. The Housemaid is also a good servant but not so agreeable a one. The droop at the corners of her mouth, indicating a plaintive, even peevish nature does not belie her I think! When M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C finds fault instead of trying to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> what he wants she <hi rend="italic">cries</hi> and sulks.</p>
<p>When do you mean to give me little Mary?<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning unclear, unless JWC was hinting (or teasing) that she would like Mary as her servant.</note> my compliments to her and to Lady Macbeth.</p>
<p>My grateful and warm love to your Husband. To yourself a hundred kisses. I will write soon again.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Sister,&#x02014;</salute>It looks unkind, and really is so that I sit so silent utterly while you are so dilig<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in writing.

<p>Jane still keeps up, really wonderfully. We must not brag; but hitherto there is room for great thankfulness, real surprise.

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>as I understood from your letter, that the butter was sent off about the same time as the eggs, I waited till I should have received both packages, and could announce the safe arrival of both at <hi rend="italic">one writing</hi>. The Eggs came <hi rend="italic">before</hi> your letter, and had not come to grief this time, at least there was no egg lost,&#x02014;half a dozen <hi rend="italic">cracked</hi>, but not spillt. The other heavier package only came to hand an hour ago. I don&#x02019;t know how long it had been on the road; but nothing had taken any hurt. The fowls look beautiful. quite fresh, and the butter all right&#x02014;only we have not had time yet to taste it. It comes, the butter, exactly at the right moment, just when Lady Ashburtons farmer at Addiscombe had written, that &#x0201c;the hamper&#x0201d; would henceforth be sent only once a week instead of three times, &#x0201c;as he had to send hampers also to her Ladyship in Devonshire.&#x0201d;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton was at Seaforth Lodge.</note> The impossibility is curious, when you consider that in each hamper there is just <hi rend="italic">two</hi> eggs, about <hi rend="italic">a gill</hi> of cream and twice a week a pound of butter! It is a compensation for those who have no toy-farms, and Farmers and Gardners, to see how a great Lady is imposed upon at all hands!&#x02014; My grey horse that Lady A&#x02019;s Coachman gave an &#x0201c;enormous price&#x0201d; for (sixty or seventy guineas!) and which Lady A absolutely <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> on my acceptance turns out too soft for <pb id="pg-41-134" n="41:134"/>even <hi rend="italic">my</hi> gentle uses. The first day of the frost I had it roughened and went out in the carriage as usual. (I have not been one day without a drive since my return) and one of the creatures hind legs got sprained somehow, and it has been laid up in its stable, with a Farrier attending it, ever since, I having to hire a horse in the meantime! The groom says that every time my horse does a little more than usual she &#x0201c;goes off her food.&#x0201d; I shall never have any comfort in driving her again, if ever she gets over this accident. And the best thing will be to sell her and <hi rend="italic">job</hi> a Horse.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C does not look to me as if he were going to keep his word and &#x0201c;get done about newyear&#x02019;s day.&#x0201d; If he get done in February I shall be thankful. I am not now so impatient for getting to Devonshire to Lady A as I was before I knew that her house there only began to be built last June! She affirms it is quite <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> nevertheless, but she had only been there for two days when she said so. As she is troubled with rheumatism herself at present, she will not be able to live in it any more than I should be unless it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> free of damp. We shall see!</p>
<p>In the mean time I have reason to thank God for the comparitive ease I still enjoy&#x02014;in spite of the severe changes of weather.&#x02014; My appetite is improved again since I had the new Cook, who sends up every thing so tidy and pretty! She seems a very nice servant indeed, and not at all extravagant. I pay her a little more wages than I was in the habit of giving; but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is not the difference at the years end. The weekly bills are diminished rather than increased since she came, tho&#x02019; we live <hi rend="italic">much</hi> better&#x02014;have all sorts of <hi rend="italic">cakes</hi> and &#x0201c;dainties&#x0201d; which no former cook unless Grace Macdonald<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles&#x02019; servant at Comely Bank and Craigenputtoch between <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date> and ca. <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280420-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:369&#x02013;70</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1828-04-20">20 April 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> was <hi rend="italic">up to</hi>. And she is a most <hi rend="italic">pleasant</hi> servant always so <hi rend="italic">polite</hi>, and obliging, with an equableness of temper rare at <hi rend="italic">fifty</hi>, and very soothing for the rest of us&#x02014;who are anything <hi rend="italic">but</hi> equable!</p>
<p>The new Housemaid is also a good servant&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">intensely</hi> &#x0201c;respectable&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;understands her business.&#x0201d; but <hi rend="italic">she</hi> is nothing like so <hi rend="italic">pleasant</hi>. The plaintive, peevish droop at the corners of her mouth which struck me at first sight don&#x02019;t belie her nature! She is too sensitive for anything but a &#x0201c;sensitive Plant&#x0201d;&#x02014;in a flower-pot! She <hi rend="italic">cries</hi> when M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is impatient, and then <hi rend="italic">sulks</hi>. And so far from <hi rend="italic">equable</hi> that she reminds me of the children of the &#x0201c;wee wifie that lived in a shoe and had so many bairns she didn&#x02019;t know what to do&#x0201d;! &#x0201c;She went to the Butcher&#x02019;s to buy them a sheep&#x02019;s head,&#x02014;and when she came back they were aa lying dead. She went to the Joiners to buy them a coffin; and when she came back they were aa sitting laughing.&#x0201d;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nursery rhyme.</note> So with Fanny. No mortal can tell the temper she will be found in! But as M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren (the Cook) says, &#x0201c;tho&#x02019; she <hi rend="italic">is disagreeable</hi> I dont see where <hi rend="small-caps">we</hi> should get a better servant on the <pb id="pg-41-135" n="41:135"/>whole&#x0201d;! I don&#x02019;t hear anything of either of the wretches who went away.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary and Helen.</note> But I am always coming upon traces of them, in the waste and destruction left behind. I was <hi rend="italic">weighed</hi> the other day and found that I had lost two pounds and a half since I was last weighed at D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russells. Considering my loss of appetite from cold and from worry, it was less than might have been expected. I am certainly sleeping better. Not to be called <hi rend="italic">well</hi> yet&#x02014;but better than I had done since before my illness. The <hi rend="italic">special misery</hi> is never so <hi rend="italic">entirely</hi> gone that I can get it put out of my head, but sufficiently in abeyance that I can lead my life <hi rend="italic">as if it were gone</hi>. Oh mercy what a different state of things from last year at Xmas! Can I ever be thankful enough!</p>
<p>God bless you Dear and all your Belongings! Many thanks for all these things and all your true affection</p>

<p><salute>Oh Darling,</salute> I have been wanting to write to you every day for a week; but the interruptions have been endless, and the unavoidable letters many,&#x02014;on Xmas day I thought I should have a quiet day for writing M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C being to dine at Forster&#x02019;s  But a young German Lady<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Elisabeth or Hedwig von Reichenbach; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641018-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to MCA, [<date when="1864-10-18">18 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> that I am very fond of &#x0201c;could not let me be left alone&#x0201d; and came at eleven in the morning, and staid till nine at night; and then our Rector,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gerald Blunt.</note> bless him! came when he left church, and sat with me till eleven!! I wonder how <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would have taken a thing that befel me last wednesday? I was waiting before a shop in Regent Street, for some items of Stationary, And a young woman, black-eyed, rosy-cheeked, with a child in her arms, thrust herself up to the carriage window, and broke forth in a paroxysm of begging; refusing to stand aside even when the Shopman was showing me envelopes  Provoked at her noise and pertinacity I said; &#x0201c;No! I will give you not a single penny, as an encouragement to annoy other people as you are annoying me.&#x0201d; If there be still such a thing as the <hi rend="italic">evil eye</hi>, that beggar woman <pb id="pg-41-136" n="41:136"/>fixed the evil eye on <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, as she said slowly, and hissing out the words, &#x0201c;This is Wednesday Lady. Perhaps you will be <hi rend="small-caps">dead</hi> by Xmas day! and have to leave <hi rend="italic">all</hi> behind you! Better to have given me a little of it <hi rend="italic">now</hi>!&#x0201d; and she scuttled away, leaving me with the novel sensation of being under a <hi rend="italic">curse</hi>!</p>
<p>Would <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi> have minded <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x02014;after the moment? I can&#x02019;t say I <hi rend="italic">took it to heart</hi>, at the same time, I was rather glad when Xmas day being over I found myself alive and just as well as before. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston writes that his wife had been dreaming about me again! Bessey is a most Portentous Dreamer! If I had been told <hi rend="italic">this</hi> between the Wednesday and Xmas day; it would have really frightened me I think!</p>
<p>My Dear! I have got five drops of my hearts-blood congealed and fastened together to encircle your wrist,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently a bracelet; JWC also called it a &#x0201c;trinket&#x0201d;; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641230-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1864-12-30">30 Dec.</date></ref></note> as a memorial of my last visit and as a newyear&#x02019;s blessing. I am hesitating whether to send it by post or by railway. I never lost nor <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> personally of anything being lost by post except the Whigham Butterfly!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a brooch in the shape of a butterfly, apparently sent to JWC by one of the Whigham sisters; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641230-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1864-12-30">30 Dec.</date></ref></note> so I had best risk it&#x02014;there is such confusion of parcels by <hi rend="italic">rail</hi> at this time of year&#x02014;only I will not <hi rend="italic">register</hi> it&#x02014;as I always think <hi rend="italic">that</hi> just points out to the covetous postman <hi rend="italic">what</hi> is worth stealing.

<p>Thanks, Dearest for so speedily satisfying my mind. After I saw my little packet tossed into the Post-master&#x02019;s Drawer, an apprehension came over me that we might have seen the last of it! To send away a trinket, which had got a prize at <hi rend="small-caps">the</hi> <hi rend="italic">Exhibition</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the Great Exhibition of <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>; unexplained further.</note> (!) unregistered, looked for the moment like a tempting of Providence! And again <hi rend="italic">the Wigham Butterfly</hi> fluttered before my mind&#x02019;s eye. But my notion is a sound one&#x02014;<hi rend="small-caps">not</hi> to seek security in <hi rend="italic">pointing out</hi> to thievish postmen the articles considered of <hi rend="italic">value</hi>, which pass thro&#x02019; their hands. No Postman of an <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> mind will risk his liberty and respectability to possess himself of a packet which the sender has not thought it worth while to pay a shilling to ensure the safety of.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-41-137" n="41:137"/>My private opinion about that Butterfly is, that it never got into the Sanquhar Postoffice at all.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641227-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1864-12-27">27 Dec.</date></ref></note> Some careless Messenger must have made away with it.</p>

I dont despair of your being in London next new years day, and of myself being alive to see it; and you shall see if I dont sit outside your bedroom door till you awake, and then glide in before the maid who opens your shutters, and speak the first &#x0201c;God bless you&#x0201d; and get your first kiss! Oh my Darling! my Darling! May this coming year be a better for you than the last! And, at the end of all my wishes for you and your wee Darling; let me add a good wish for myself! may you be as good and true for us in the coming year as you have been thro&#x02019; all the years that we have known you!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC was initially very suspicious of Louisa Stewart-Mackenzie (see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581030-JWC-MR-01"><sic>34:231</sic><corr>JWC to MR, [<date when="1858-10-30">30 Oct. 1858</date>]</corr></ref>), but was quite won over during her first visit, <date when="1860-01-00">Jan. 1860</date>, to The Grange after Lady Louisa&#x02019;s marriage to Lord Ashburton; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600116-JWC-LLA-01"><sic>36:45</sic><corr>JWC to LLA, <date when="1860-01-16">16 Jan. 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Miss Bromley was here the night before last, and told me she &#x0201c;had not heard from you but in the shape of a Turkey&#x0201d;!&#x02014; I too had heard from you in that same shape! But I want a little morsel of your perplexing handwriting besides! Morning after morning I look at my letters discontentedly&#x02014;because of the one that never comes!</p>
<p>I should have written, without waiting for a letter from you, to say several things I could not get said in the carriage that day, about the Horse!&#x02014;that Horse which I felt towards somewhat as the Gentleman of the Omnibus must have felt towards the Baby he had <hi rend="italic">taken to hold</hi>; when the mother vanished into space! But the Horse itself introduced a sudden complication into the <pb id="pg-41-139" n="41:139"/>business, which I wished to see the end of before telling you. After having done her usual moderate work one day&#x02014;the third day, I think, after you were here; she turned lame in one of her<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In this sentence she wrote &#x0201c;his,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;he,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;his,&#x0201d; then went back and overwrote &#x0201c;her,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;she,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;her.&#x0201d; She previously referred to the horse as male; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641207-JWC-LLA-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1864-12-07">7 Dec.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641219-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1864-12-19">19 Dec.</date>]</ref>.</note> hind legs, and was in such pain that the Farrier had to be &#x0201c;called in,&#x0201d; and a course of poultices adopted, and castor-oil &#x0201c;thrown into the system.&#x0201d;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18231125-TC-JAC-01"><sic>2:479</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1823-11-25">25 Nov. 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> and &#x0201c;nothing positive could be said about her for some days yet.&#x0201d;&#x02014; I have had a horse from the Livery Stable in the meanwhile; and it was &#x0201c;all right,&#x0201d;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> so soon as I felt some assurance that the poor dear Grey would not need to be shot. But you cannot think how it vexed me the dread of that consumation! Such a way of thanking you for giving me a Horse!&#x02014;to shoot it!</p>
<p>I have had Bennett to see it; and he thinks as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Silvester does, that it would be no use attempting to work the Horse at present altho&#x02019; the lameness is gone, &#x0201c;It should be let run in a strawyard over the winter Bennet says and her Ladyship would be quite willing it should run about at Addiscombe.&#x0201d; <hi rend="italic">Would</hi> her Ladyship be quite willing? Bennet would take it there himself he says, and &#x0201c;apply some strengthening blister stuff&#x0201d; which he &#x0201c;has plenty of&#x0201d;&#x02014; Will you say one word of this!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is working as hard as his Life depended on being done in January&#x02014;and is so&#x02014;so&#x02014;what shall I say? bedevilled&#x02014;! Naturally! The last mile of a journey is always the worst&#x02014;and the last mile of such a journey as <hi rend="italic">his</hi> has been!&#x02014; <hi rend="small-caps">Ach</hi>!</p>
<p>And he always speaks as if the next thing to be done after finishing were to go to Seaton. As for me it is my one bit of blue sky at present, that <hi rend="italic">Seaton</hi>!</p>
<p>The Brougham is at the door and I must go and get ready for that Driving which my sleep and I may say my Life depends on.</p>

<salute>Dear Maria</salute>
<p>Thanks for your new-year good wishes.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear of your wellbeing. I thought should have seen you before now&#x02014;either that you would come here, or that I should call at your gate someday, in the course of my daily drives. I have got a carriage and Horse now, &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">all to myself</hi>&#x0201d; (as the children say), and I am out driving from two to three hours every day, in all weathers; exercise in the open air being the only means under Heaven by which I can get <hi rend="italic">any</hi> sleep, and my power of walking being now limited to a few <hi rend="italic">yards</hi> at a time! So&#x02014;I had it in my mind to call for you someday, when driving about <hi rend="italic">the Commons</hi>  But I did, not rightly remember your address,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced.</note> and my Coachman, (not one of the Silvesters, but an old man who once fell on his head, and has been clear about nothing ever since) could give me no furtherance in finding it.</p>
<p>When I look back on my awful sufferings this time last year; I cannot sufficiently thank god for the <hi rend="italic">comparative</hi> ease I now enjoy. &#x02018;W<hi rend="small-caps">ell</hi>,&#x02019; I am not, and never expect to be; But the agony of suffering, which, for near a year, made me long for death every hour of every day&#x02014;<hi rend="small-caps">that</hi> is so far subsided that I can now lead my life, outwardly, much as I used to do; except for the weakness in my back and limbs which makes me unable to take long walks, or mount <hi rend="italic">steps</hi> (!) or go up stairs three steps at a time!</p>
<p>All my people have been adorably kind to me thro&#x02019; my long illness. As for Lady Ashburton, my own Sister, had I been blessed to have one, couldnt have been more to me than she has been! So soon as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has got his Book off his hands,&#x02014;(in a few weeks&#x02014;) He and I mean to go to Lady Ashburton at Seaton in Devonshire, where she is passing the winter. The D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> all recommended <hi rend="italic">change</hi> for me as the most important remedy. and I like being with <hi rend="italic">Her</hi>.</p>
<p>I had a nice little note from your Mother<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Chamberlayne, who had worked for the Ashburtons at The Grange.</note> this morning. When you write please thank her for me.</p>
<p>You remember Mary my little Cook? She produced a Baby in the house here, on the <date when="1864-07-29">29<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of July</date>, during my absence in Scotland. And that was far from the worst of her; as it turned out!</p>

<salute>Dear Lady</salute>
<p>So generously obliging as you are to us,&#x02014;permit me to say candidly what it is that I really do wish in regard to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last act of munificence, that handsome young Grey Mare. It is that you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> nobly take it back, and put it to the work it was bo<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for (&#x0201c;at a long price,&#x0201d; as Bennet told our man)! &#x0201c;That is impossible,&#x0201d; you will ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; &#x0201c;the work is already fallen to other <hi rend="italic">hoofs</hi>&#x0201d;? What a pity, what a pity, if that is really so! Perhaps it is not <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> altogether; and things c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be revoked if you willed it?&#x02014; But if it is irrevocable, hear what follows:</p>
<p>This fine little Mare is standing idle, in a <hi rend="italic">stable</hi> I don&#x02019;t much like (for ventilation); her lameness gone for a week past,&#x02014;but liable to <hi rend="italic">return</hi>, says everybody, if she be tried in that carriage ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. In fact everybody&#x02019;s vote is that she must never be yoked to <hi rend="italic">it</hi> more. &#x0201c;A fine shewy horse, too,&#x0201d; our good old Stable-keeper<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Silvester.</note> says; &#x0201c;very nice temper &#x26;c; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> bring a good price in <date when="`865-04-00">April</date> or May!&#x0201d;&#x02014; And mark withal, dear Lady; I don&#x02019;t think y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Bennet has been <hi rend="italic">dishonest</hi>,&#x02014;I do think only misled (if even misled, for he didn&#x02019;t calculate on a brougham of that weight). He votes however that the Mare be at once turned into looser quarter softer diet, at Addiscombe;&#x02014;will himself take her over, and give instructions whenever you bid him. Please send him a line! That I really do wish;&#x02014;and that will settle everything till at least we <hi rend="italic">see</hi> Seaton &#x26;My Lady!&#x02014;&#x02014;</p>
<p>How gladly shall we sally out thither, were the hour come. I really am close on the edge of <hi rend="italic">finis</hi>; toiling with all my strength every moment. &#x0201c;Day of Publicat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is to be <date when="1865-02-15">15 feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date> at latest!&#x0201d; And two weeks before that I hope to be personally quite out of it.&#x02014; <closer><salute>Adieu, dear Lady.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dearest.</salute> I had sworn to answer a letter from my Aunt Elizabeth,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Welsh in Edinburgh.</note> as in duty bound; before writing to any one else for my own pleasure; and duty-letters always take me so long! after trying <hi rend="italic">three</hi> morning in succession I finally paid off Elizabeth yesterday; and tho&#x02019; this morning&#x02019;s Post has brought me three letters, of which at least <hi rend="italic">two</hi> require answers, they can wait while I please <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> in telling you my news, such as they are! In fact &#x0201c;none to speak of.&#x0201d;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430818-JWC-TC-01"><sic>17:63</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-08-18">18 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> Was there ever such uncertain weather? Yesterday I speculated about substituting a shawl for my fur coat; but didn&#x02019;t do it luckily, for before my drive ended it <pb id="pg-41-145" n="41:145"/>had become extremely cold. &#x0201c;Frost again&#x0201d; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C said, but when he looked out at bedtime it was falling &#x0201c;a soft warm rain&#x0201d;! During the night, a snow-storm covered everything some inches deep! While dressing I looked out on a <hi rend="italic">white</hi> world!&#x02014; <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, already the snow has washed itself away in the rapidest thaw I ever beheld! What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a delicate object, like <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, to do amidst such changes? Follow Paddy&#x02019;s rule I suppose, &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">just keep never minding</hi>&#x0201d;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471118-TC-JF-01"><sic>22:161</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1847-11-18">18 Nov. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> Practically I <hi rend="italic">do that</hi>. No weather has yet kept me to the House a day since I left Holm Hill! I am sure that it is the driving, and nothing else, that enables me to get some sleep, more or less <hi rend="italic">every</hi> night. I observe that when I stay out three hours, as I do most days, I sleep better than when I have been out only two hours. But it is still some work to get thro&#x02019; the <hi rend="italic">nights</hi>! Such tossing about before I go <hi rend="italic">suddenly</hi> to sleep! such a many and miserable wakings when I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> gone to sleep! But I keep to the new habit of having no <hi rend="italic">night-light</hi>, and no accepible<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> <hi rend="italic">watch</hi>; and I am sure it is best so!</p>
<p>I still have the tumbler of newmilk at eight&#x02014;and I eat pretty well&#x02014;for me, who had never a large &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">receiver</hi>&#x0201d; (as a poor woman at Haddington<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> used to call stomach)</p>
<p>I take no medecine except my old pills&#x02014;but these I cannot dispense with for a day.</p>
<p>On the whole I get no worse  Not much better either I think, I have not gone into the <hi rend="italic">Shampooing</hi>; having a perfect horror of the women who come to manipulate one in any way! I have a sort of <hi rend="italic">insane</hi> objection to being <hi rend="italic">come close to</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">touched</hi> by any extraneous person, that I am not in sympathy with! Oh no! I can put on and off my own clothes now, and am so thankful I can avoid a servant fiddling about me!&#x02014; &#x02014; Even D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston who has as little patience with freaks of the imagination as anybody I ever saw, recognised the fact that the worry of &#x0201c;the woman&#x0201d; who came in to rub me &#x26;c at St Leonards<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> &#x0201c;did me more harm than her services did me good&#x0201d;! If I <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> but little, or <hi rend="italic">no</hi> better than I did at Holm Hill, at least I dont feel so much the <hi rend="italic">fatigue</hi> of walking lame&#x02014;am either stronger to bear it, or more used to it! We are an odd pair here just now; for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is walking lamer than I do! He is the most careless, most reckless of riders and has oftener brought his horse down and been pitched over its head, than any man I know. The other day again, his horse, who has no vice, only high spirits, delighted at having his head turned towards home, threw all its four feet at once into the air; and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C not so much as thinking he was on the back of a horse was tossed in the air!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x02019;s account of the fall, see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18650116-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1865-01-16">16 Jan.</date></ref></note> In general he <pb id="pg-41-146" n="41:146"/>comes out of these adventures perfectly scatheless, never seeming surprised at, or particularly thankful for his escape. This time however he hurt his ancle bone&#x02014;not a sprain, nor much of a bruise. but a sufficient hurt to make it impossible for him to take his usual <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> exercise; tho he can ride as usual.</p>
<p>I bathe it&#x02014;as much as he will let me with arnica in water&#x02014;and it is greatly better&#x02014;the swelling gone down&#x02014;and he can walk after a sort without pain, but there is no getting him to take care of it&#x02014;and I am afraid he will take a long walk and play the devil with it again&#x02014;</p>
<p>I sent M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ewart a book which I hope she will not find too dull&#x02014;also a volume of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to the young man at Laight.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Haining; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641031-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1864-10-31">31 Oct.</date>].</ref></note></p>
<p>How strange it is to think of the old Father standing crying beside me that evening, because his son was dying&#x02014;and now <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is dead and his son is alive!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> noted, <date when="1864-12-06">6 Dec.</date>: &#x0201c;At Laicht, Tynron, on the <date when="1864-11-29">29th</date> ult., Thomas Haining, farmer, Laight, aged 68 years.&#x0201d;</note> I hope the poor young fellow will recover.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x02014;</salute>In y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> solicitude you have aggravated to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self the affair of the ancle. I don&#x02019;t think it will turn out very serious. Evidently nothing is <hi rend="italic">hurt</hi> except the top of the ancle-bone (<hi rend="italic">periostium</hi> there, I suppose) and that by no means much; tho&#x02019; the whole foot had got <hi rend="italic">dirled</hi> and shaken, and is swolen in consequence tho&#x02019; the pain <hi rend="italic">gen</hi>lly lasted only the first night. Today I think the swelling is <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> rather abated than otherwise; on the outskirts too it <pb id="pg-41-148" n="41:148"/>is getting black (like a black eye, going away) as upon the toes, inside of the heel &#x26;c, and even slightly over the instep part.

Evening still vivid to me.

On her face, too, when I went out, there was a silent, faint, and pathetic smile, which I well felt at the moment, and better now! Often enough had it cut me to the heart to think what she was suffering by this book, in which she had no share, no interest, nor any word at all; and with what noble and perfect constancy of silence she bore it all. My own heroic little woman: For long months after this I sank and sank into ever new depths of stupefaction and dull misery of body and mind; nay, once or twice into momentary spurts of impatience even with her, which now often burn me with vain remorse: Madame Elise, e.g.&#x02014;I sulkily refused to alight at the shop there, though I saw and knew she gently wished it (and right well deserved it); Brompton Museum (which she took me to, always glad to get me with her, and so seldom could). Oh, cruel, cruel! I have remembered Johnson and Uttoxeter on thought of that Elise cruelty more than once; and if any clear energy ever returned to me, might some day imitate it.&#x02014;T.C.&#x0201d; (TC&#x02019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:242&#x02013;43).

<p>I have to ask your pardon, as it is mostly my fault that your letter to Mr. Carlyle has lain so long without any sort of answer.</p>
<p>My husband being exceptionally busy in these weeks, just <hi rend="italic">finishing</hi> his long laborious work (The History of Frederick), handed me the letter, and desired me to answer it. Not only was he pressed for time, he said, but I &#x0201c;had more knowledge of the subject than <hi rend="italic">He</hi> had,&#x0201d; not knowing at all what likeness of him was the best&#x02014;or rather the least bad! I took the letter and laid it by, and &#x0201c;did intend&#x0201d;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> to do his bidding as soon as I should have finished some business in hand, and&#x02014;forgot it utterly!&#x02014;till this morning that your letter fell accidentally under my eyes, giving me the sensation of a blow in the face!</p>
<p>I now hasten to inform you that there is positively no <hi rend="italic">good</hi> likeness of my husband to be had for love or money. He has been sculptured and painted and photographed over and over and over again, but with always the same ill success&#x02014;at least the result has been always more or less of a failure.</p>
<p>He promised long ago to sit to Holman Hunt for a portrait;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There is no record of a painting of TC by William Holman Hunt, although TC admired his work; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600419-TC-LS-01"><sic>36:99&#x02013;100</sic><corr>TC to LS, <date when="1860-04-19">19 April 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note> as soon as his book was done; I expect something comfortable may come out of <hi rend="italic">that</hi>!</p>

I proposed a Doctor; but poor old Barnes is quite <hi rend="italic">done</hi>;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Alfred Brooke Barnes, who was probably suffering from dementia.</note> and we were at a loss who, she answer<hi rend="italic">g</hi> positively &#x0201c;None.&#x0201d; Tuesday night, I sent for young Barnes;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Herbert Sedgwick Barnes.</note> who proves to be a very sensible fellow: he pronounced the thing at once to be <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> (taking the stomach &#x26;intestines); &#x26;at once produced some relief in it (mustard blister &#x26;c); and has gone on improving her and it steadily ever since;&#x02014;so that we hope it is now fairly on the departing hand. God grant it! In my gloom for the first two days, I was considerable alarmed.</p>
<p>My <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Proof is with Robson; he undertakes that I shall be <hi rend="italic">off altogether</hi> by Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> night (say Monday Morning)!&#x02014;</p>
<p>There has long been a hanging engage<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that, <hi rend="italic">on</hi> this event, we were to go at once to Lady Ashburnt<hi rend="italic">n&#x02019;s</hi>, who has built herself a nice little Cottage (or small mansion) by the sea-shore (Seaton the neighb<hi rend="italic">g</hi> Town, in Devonshire, close by the Dorsetshire border): of course, we cannow<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> now go there at once; but still <hi rend="italic">intend</hi>, as the perhaps eligiblest place of all, till fine weather &#x26;Scotland supervene! Ah me, ah me!&#x02014; &#x02014; I feel utterly <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi>, weak &#x26;c; but expect confidently to rally by <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>. Yesterday I first put on <hi rend="italic">leather</hi> shoes ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; walked, instead of rode. Quite well that.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I did not wish to frighten you; and so have said nothing till now, when I can give a little better acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. Last Sunday night, quite on the sudden, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> bedtime, poor Jane was taken very ill;&#x02014;lay moaning, when I came in from my final walk, and c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hardly speak to me: she had been out that day, as <hi rend="italic">every</hi> day, for a long drive; and complained of nothing all ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>. I fancied it might be something of cold; for day (the lazy <hi rend="italic">break of a storm</hi>) was a dirty damp-frosty, leaden-coloured day: but she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not hear of a Doctor;&#x02014;lay in that moaning miserable way all night, all next day; then ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> all next day, totally sleepless, foodless: at length on <hi rend="italic">Tuesday Ev</hi>g, I insisted on some kind of Doctor (the <hi rend="italic">son</hi> of our old Barnes, who has done really well): in two hours, he had produced some relief; and things have gone on well ever since;&#x02014;so that the poor soul is now in the Drawingroom ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and takes some food &#x26;sleep, and is cheerful of speech; tho&#x02019; not permitted to think of <hi rend="italic">driving</hi> ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> till Monday at soonest.</p>
<p>My Printer was to have sent me the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Sheet this morning; but has not done it, has put it off till night; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I like quite as well, not being in very fine <pb id="pg-41-154" n="41:154"/>key today. I will finish him <hi rend="italic">off</hi> on Monday, I think; Book is to &#x0201c;come out ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 20&#x0201d; (guess March 1). Today I am going (heroically!) to have a vile decayed tooth pulled out. I have endless things to sort &#x26;sweep away. I have even to have my hair cut; nay even to have my beard <hi rend="italic">clipt</hi>,&#x02014;both of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> have been neglected this long time. Scotland and you, depend upon it, I will see, if we both live. Nay I often think if I had some <hi rend="italic">hadding</hi>, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be tempted to stay there. This rousing muddy Babylon has become horrible &#x26;odious to me. Nothing can exceed the state state <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word repeated at turn of page.</note> of <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi> wreck I am in; but I confidently hope to improve when turned out to grass &#x26;the shoes off.</p>
 <p>We are due first at Lady Ashburtons, a small quiet Sea-Mansion in Devonshire (ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 3 hours off us), so soon as Jane is able to travel. It will be as dull as needs; but the <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> &#x26;clear air will be welcome. As soon as the weather invites at all, I am off, after that, by the Carlisle Rail. I am going to put away my little caper-<hi rend="italic">haddock</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >While TC used &#x0201c;haddock&#x0201d; as a derogatory term for people (cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250307-TC-JAC-01"><sic>3:296</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1825-03-07">7 March 1825</date></corr></ref>), he used it as an affectionate term for a horse (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340119-TC-JCA-01"><sic>7:68</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1834-01-19">19 [Jan.? 1834]</date></corr></ref>); &#x0201c;caper&#x0201d; was what Noggs did constantly.</note> of a Horse; man never was more tired of thing than I am of riding in the ever raging, jumbling, shrieking and every way disgusting purlieus of this Babylon the Larger (and the uglier surely!)&#x02014; I have had by computat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> near 30,000 miles<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC calculated he rode his previous horse, Fritz, 20,000 mi.

I have daily <hi rend="italic">fash</hi> with it, tho&#x02019; myself done. Sometimes I begin operating on the cartload of rubbish it has left; but not with any vigour yet.

    <salute>Dearest</salute>
    <p>I have just received your letter, and will not lose a post in answering it tho in a day or two I might be able to write more to your satisfaction&mdash; I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> been ill&mdash;<hi rend="italic">very</hi> ill, and confined to bed for a week; and tho now able to sit up most of the day, I am so wearied that I cannot do anything but read a few pages now and then of some silly novel.</p>
    <p>The D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> said I had got &ldquo;a chill&rdquo; (I am sure I dont know when or how) and the result was <hi rend="italic">inflamation of the bowels</hi> and I was for three days and nights in such agony as I never felt before&mdash;but rather <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&mdash;then the old nervous business!&mdash;</p>

    <p>
      <pb id="pg-41-160" n="41:160" />
      Now Darling I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> write a decent letter today&mdash;this is the first time I have had pen in hand since Saturday gone a week</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Jane has continued to improve, on the whole; yesterday, in spite of the frost, she ventured out to drive, for the first time; and today she is preparing ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>: bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> 2 and 3 hours each drive;&#x02014;so that I hope we are now fairly looking up; and if all go well, the poor Dame and I shall actually be able for the road on Monday <date when="1865-02-20">20th</date>, as per program. But you shall have a more punctual waybill before that. Perhaps you can tell us the <hi rend="italic">best train</hi>; and at any rate <hi rend="italic">wh</hi>h railway it is?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >London and South Western Railway; the nearest station to Seaton was Axminster, about 150 mi. (241.5 km.) SW of London.</note>&#x02014; Three hours of it is not much.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was a five hour journey; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18650216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1865-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref></note> If we can get Jane <hi rend="italic">bro</hi>t <hi rend="italic">down</hi> with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> injury, I calculate there will be less fear after,&#x02014;on y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> more temperate shore, and with so many satisfact<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> awaiting her there. With three hours or less of daily drive, she does beautifully; can walk, too, in stooping posture, with her stick; and is really cheerful company when I return at dusk. I believe it indispensable that she sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> bring her maid &#x0201c;Fanny&#x0201d; with her, this time; Fanny is an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> quietly active creature, &#x26;will do nobody any ill.&#x02014; As to me I design to be as still as a mouse, &#x26;enjoy the <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> element (spiritual &#x26;physical) and blessed silence, by way of change from what there has been. Will read a little, walk a good deal, ride d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> (since you are so good),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton arranged for a horse to be available for TC at Seaforth.</note> <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>,&#x02014;and thank Heaven for such a resting-place after a long journey thro&#x02019; Chaos and the Realms Below!&#x02014;</p>
<p>I have made a nice arrang<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for Noggs: the excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Rector Blunt<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. Gerald Blunt; his wife, Frances Blunt, wrote in her diary: &#x0201c;<date when="1865-02-06">Feb. 6</date>.&#x02014; Mr. Carlyle came in the evening; offered G. his horse. &#x0002f; <date when="1865-02-07">Feb. 7</date>&#x02014; G. tried Mr. Carlyle&#x02019;s horse in morning.&#x0201d; Their son Reginald later recalled: &#x0201c;Carlyle came round to the Rectory and offered my father his horse &#x02018;Noggs,&#x02019; which he declined to accept, but offered to keep him in the Rectory stables, and to ride him occasionally in Carlyle&#x02019;s absence. This he did during February and March, but I don&#x02019;t think he found &#x02018;Noggs&#x02019; a very satisfactory steed; he had too long been accustomed to the ways of a pre-occupied rider, who had ambled absent-mindedly about 30,000 miles&#x02014;the majority of it while he was thrashing out &#x02018;Frederick the Great.&#x02019; People had often seen Noggs grazing quietly along the roadside on Clapham Common, the reins loose upon his neck, whilst history was being evolved upon his back; and Noggs, having too long had his own way, resented a rider who had ideas of his own as to whither and at what pace they should go&#x0201d; (Reginald Blunt, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Gerald Blunt of Chelsea</hi> [<date when="1911-00-00">1911</date>] 87, 89).</note> is to ride him here in my absence; the capricious tho&#x02019; well-deserving Noggs.

<salute>My Dear</salute>
<p>The box is come&#x02014;and this time the eggs have been a great success&#x02014;not a single one broken! Neither were the cakes broken to any inconvenient degree. Already they are half eaten&#x02014;by <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C wouldnt take a morsel because <pb id="pg-41-165" n="41:165"/>&#x0201c;there was butter in them&#x02014;a <hi rend="italic">fatal mistake</hi>! on the part of poor Mary&#x0201d;! I told him I believed it was not <hi rend="italic">butter</hi> but <hi rend="italic">cream</hi>, and no &#x02018;mistake&#x02019; at all; as the cakes you made for me in that way at the Gill agreed with me quite well. It was so kind of you to take such immediate note of my longing! My dear little Woman! you not only do kind things but you do them in such a kind way! Many a kind action misses the grateful feelings it should win by the want of graciousness in the doing.</p>
<p>I continue improving; but that week of terrible pain has given me a good shake; and I don&#x02019;t feel in such good heart about the Devonshire visit as I did. Still it stands settled at present that we go on the 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi>. God willing  For how long will depend on how M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C gets on with his sleep &#x26;c&#x02014;</p>
<p>I shall take my housemaid with me as Lady&#x02019;s maid&#x02014; For I shudder at the notion of being at the mercy of other peoples servants when I am so weak and easily knocked down. She is a very respectable woman the new housemaid, and both she and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren (the cook) were as kind to me as kind could be when I was laid up. I never was so well cared for before, and with so little fuss since I left my Mothers house. It is a real blessing to have got good efficient, comfortable servants at last! And I may say I have <hi rend="italic">earned</hi> it by the amount of bad servants I have endured.</p>
<p>I have a great deal to do today&#x02014;and little strength so goodby&#x02014;I will write soon again.</p>

It was settled between Lady A and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C that we should go to Devonshire on the <date when="1865-02-20">20<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>&#x02014; I dont see the possibility if the snow dont disappear before then&#x02014; And I am much <hi rend="italic">weaker</hi> for this illness&#x02014;my appetite not returned&#x02014;won&#x02019;t I suppose till I get regular exercise again. I have been out in the carriage twice and am going again today&#x02014;tho it is ever so cold&#x02014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">That</hi> is partly why I cannot write a decent letter&#x02014; My morning time had to be spent in writing to poor dear Betty whose only son after twelve years of utter helplessness has finally been released from life</p>
<p>She will feel his loss terribly just because he has been such a weary incessant care and anxiety to her for so many years&#x02014;</p>
<p>Oh there is the carriage and I have to dress</p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>

&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I understand myself to have got from the London Library (where the <hi rend="italic">Abhandlungen</hi> are taken it, but read by nobody), and to have returned it at once. I have not the least tradit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of it farther, and have not tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of it much less seen it for the last 10 years. The thing is easily replaceable in Berlin, I dare say. Possible too that it may still lie here (tho&#x02019; surely if I knew it to be from Weimar,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The treatise was sent to TC, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date> (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540428-TC-JN-01"><sic>29:72</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1854-04-28">28 April 1854</date></corr></ref>), by Bernhard Rudolf Abeken (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x02013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), educationist and scholar, who at one time lived in Weimar; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521015-TC-JAC-01"><sic>27:333</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1852-10-15">15 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>. TC was apparently replying to a query from Neuberg about the whereabouts of the treatise.</note> I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have locked it by somewhere!)&#x02014;of course if it turn up in the now instant Doomsday of Rubbish, I will take punctual care of it.</p>
<p>You may now write to Tauchnitz<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Bernhard Tauchnitz (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x02013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>), Leipzig publisher, who pbd. a 13 vol.

<p>I sent the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> a Book yesterday; pray don&#x02019;t let him be writing to thank me for it, or the bother to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> will outrun the satisfaction!

<p>The weather is much improved in the last week, and I suppose <hi rend="italic">we</hi> shall go to Devonshire very soon. I will write before we start&#x02014;that you may not have the excuse of not knowing where I am to make for silence.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have written to you on friday;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote on a Wed.</note>
 but y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter, for wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I was much obliged, found me just in the act of mounting <hi rend="italic">Noggs</hi>;&#x02014;after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> till Monday there was no chance. On Monday I had engaged myself to Denmark Hill, for a sight of Ruskin&#x02019;s superb mineralogical Collection and a free discourse upon the same:&#x02014;an Adventure that proved pleasant enough while it lasted, but wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had considerably lamed me for bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> on the day following. You see how my poor hand shakes even now;&#x02014;I have been sending Forster&#x02019;s Books home to him; oh what a grovelling in London dust, and bundling &#x26;tying, there has been with London Library,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-41/lt-18650221-TC-JEJ-01">TC to JEJ, <date when="1865-02-21">21 Feb.</date></ref></note> with one &#x26;the other (Forster now for finis) with all that!</p>
<p>For the rest I am the idlest of all mankind; feel as if I had not only got done with <hi rend="italic">Fr</hi>h, but with all the work I had to do in this Planet. A gloomy but quiet <hi rend="italic">collapse</hi> there is, in mind &#x26;body;&#x02014;a world left very <hi rend="italic">vacant</hi> in comparison, and much less lovely to me than it once was. I know not whether I am not quite at the bottom of the process: but it is curious to see how the <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> and all things take a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> &#x26;revolutionary course, and say each in its own dialect, &#x0201c;We have done, then, Master; haven&#x02019;t we?&#x0201d;&#x02014; &#x02014; I do nothing but ride a little, walk a little, &#x26;read any supportable thing I can find. I don&#x02019;t feel as if there were much of <hi rend="italic">ruined</hi> in me; but everything is in such a <hi rend="italic">smashed</hi> &#x26;completely tired out condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> as never before. In partic<hi rend="italic">r</hi> this right hand (the left <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yet) has for almost 2 years back taken to <hi rend="italic">shaking</hi> at a new &#x26;unpleasant rate;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x02019;s handwriting was particularly shaky in this letter.</note> especially shakes, if I have been muscularly working at any thing. It must take its own way!&#x02014;</p>
<p>The Devonshire speculat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> seems to hang fire; and I am now &#x26;then impatient at hanging in the vague, <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi> for it, not knowing my times &#x26;days. I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think it probably will take effect &#x0201c;early next week.&#x0201d; For my own part, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like as well if it <hi rend="italic">said</hi> it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not at all. But I am determined to see the Spring skies somewhere with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> London defilement.&#x02014;</p>

Part I&#x02014;The Hell</hi> (<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>) had just been pbd. In his preface he distinguished his version from various previous trans., particularly those by John A.

Rossetti explained: &#x0201c;Cayley gives substance, form and spirit [but was not a literal translation]. &#x02026; Carlyle gives the substance, and its spirit, with that literality which is due to earnestness and scholarship, and to the absolute neglect of form in metre,&#x02014;his translations &#x02026; being in prose. Between Cayley&#x02019;s completeness &#x02026; and Carlyle&#x02019;s literal prose, with its entire abnegation of form, there remained a middle course. &#x02026; Pollock adopted this middle course. &#x02026; My attempt is of precisely the same class as Pollock&#x02019;s. Like him, I have aimed at unconditional literality in phraseology &#x02026; and like him I have kept to the metre&#x0201d; (<hi rend="italic">Comedy</hi> ii&#x02013;iii).</note>&#x02014;His Transl<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is very literal; but can&#x02019;t be understood, tho&#x02019; it is clever</p>
<p>If you care the least for a sight of Rosetti I will at once send it <hi rend="italic">for good</hi></p></ps>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>We have never yet got to Devonshire; but are now actually going the day after tomorrow. It was not our blame; nor indeed anybody&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">blame</hi>, only that of the wild weather, hospitably taken to be dangerous for invalids;&#x02014;and now we are not to hang off and on any longer, but to <hi rend="italic">go</hi>. My own prospects of benefit or pleasure are as moderate as possible: but there will at least be cleaner air to breathe; and a completer silence, sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> one take to reflecting in any profitable way; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I confess I have not yet in the least managed or hardly even attempted to do. Never in my life was I so sordidly indolent, so content to be so,&#x02014;&#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">Cui bono</hi> [<hi rend="italic">What is the good of it</hi>]?&#x0201d; the ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to every suggestion, that rises on that score. Whether I am even yet got to the <hi rend="italic">bottom</hi> of the rotheap, I don&#x02019;t know; but shall be prepared for deeper descents, I hope, if such are in store. The truth is I have been buried alive, these 12 years, as few men ever were; and have had such a fill of disgusting labours, mostly unprofitable, as has completely satisfied my appetite in that kind for all time coming.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x02014;</salute>Your Note yesterday morning found us just getting under way; and acted like the &#x0201c;old shoe&#x0201d; you wished. We came along beautifully; had the carriage, a great place like a drawingroom all to ourselves two; discovered Lady Ashburton herself in the train (who had run up to London on some bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> the day before); and got all home together, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> skaith or discomfort of any kind to speak of, a while before sunset. The country is all beautiful, earth and air clean as the salt sea; sky bright as diamonds, sun out strong, tho&#x02019; the <pb id="pg-41-183" n="41:183"/>north-wind in places is a little stronger. I have walked two hours this morning by myself, am afterwards to <hi rend="italic">ride</hi>, &#x26;c &#x26;c: and reading, any <hi rend="italic">work</hi> especially, I perceive, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be difficult or impossible, but that is small matter at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>; the less of that, I suppose, the better for me. Jane has bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a maid with her; and we hope will manage to make a tolerable shift, poor soul: she is to have a bout of <hi rend="italic">Bath-chair</hi> (under the Cliffs where the Sun has it <hi rend="italic">all</hi> his own way), after that to go driving, <hi rend="italic">open</hi>, I regret to say, but in all imaginable wrappages &#x26;furs, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she hopes will break the vice of the elements. We have two guests; an excell<hi rend="italic">t silent</hi> Gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (Sir Walter Trevellyan, who is to ride with me this afternoon), and his Lady an Invalid: they are elderly intellig<hi rend="italic">t</hi> very worthy people; from Northumberland by usual habitat; but are building themselves a Sea Villa here,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Trevelyans&#x02019; house, Calverley Lodge (now called Check House), Seaton, was built in the neo-Gothic style by builder and architect Joseph Good (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x02013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>), under the supervision of local architect Charles Frederick Edwards (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x02013;<date when="1897-00-00">97</date>) and based on a design by the Irish architect Benjamin Woodward (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x02013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>; <ref target="volume-41/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29941"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I was to have written before I went on my travels; but adverse circumstances were too powerful. First, the <hi rend="italic">nausea</hi>, which I think I complained of in my last letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-41/lt-1865228-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1865-02-28">28 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note>
 kept increasing; so that I had no heart to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> anything that could be let alone, till the last possible moment, and my last days were crammed full of shopping, and packing, and leave-taking, and settling with workmen about repairs and whitewashing to be done in our absence; so that any moment left me, to bless myself in, was devoted to lying quite <hi rend="small-caps">done</hi> on the sofa rather than to letter-writing.</p>
<p>When we started on Wednesday morning, with, on my part, no sleep &#x0201c;to speak of&#x0201d;&#x02014;and five hours of railway before us, besides a carriage drive after, my mood was of the blackest. But George Cooke was at the Station to look after our luggage, and, halfway, the Sun broke out, and it was new Country for me, part of the way, and very beautiful; and the <hi rend="italic">sheep</hi>, bless them! were not only <hi rend="italic">white</hi> as milk, but had dear wee lambs skipping beside them! And the river, that falls into the Sea near here, was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> muddy and slugish; like all the rivers (very few indeed) I had seen since I left dear Nith;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The river that flows near Holmhill.</note>
 but clear as crystal and bright <hi rend="italic">blue</hi>! And, at the end, such a lovely House, on a high cliff, overlooking the bluest sea! and such a lovely and loveable Hostess!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201c;Seaforth (near Seaton, Devonshire) is the Dowager Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s pretty cottage, who waited for us at the station that Wednesday evening, and was kindness itself. It was Wednesday, <date when="1865-03-08">March 8, 1865</date>, when we made the journey. The day was dry and temperate; we had a carriage to ourselves, and she (though far weaker than I had the least idea of&#x02014;stupid I!) made no complaint, nor, indeed, took any harm; though at the end (Lady Ashburton having brought an open carriage unfit for the coldish evening of a day so bright, we had to wrap our invalid in quite a heap of rugs and shawls, covering her very face and head; in which she patiently acquiesced, nor did she suffer by it afterwards. &#x0002f; I think we stayed above a month; and in spite of the noise, the exposure, &#x26;c., she did really well, slept wonderfully, and was charming in her cheerful weakness. She drove out almost or altogether daily. Sir Walter and Lady Trevelyan were close neighbours, often fellow-guests. Sir Walter and I rode almost daily, on ponies; talk innocent, quasi-scientific even, but dull, dull! My days were heavy laden, but had in them something of hope. My darling&#x02019;s well-being helped much. Ah, me! ah, me! We drove to Exeter one day (Lady A., a Miss Dempster, and we two); how pretty and cheery her ways that day! Lady A. came up to London with us. From a newspaper we learned the death of Cobden (which may serve to date if needed).&#x02014;T.C.&#x0201d; (TC&#x02019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:246&#x02013;47). Richard Cobden (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x02013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>; <ref target="volume-41/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5741"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), radical politician; he d. <date when="1865-04-02">2 April</date>.

For Miss Dempster, see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18650327-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1865-03-27">27 March</date></ref>.</note>&#x02014; So <pb id="pg-41-185" n="41:185"/>truly the latter end of that woman was better than the beginning!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 7:8.</note></p>
<p>I am glad to find the insane horror I conceived of the Sea, all in one night, at St Leonards has quite passed away. I love it again as I had always done till then&#x02014;and rather regret that no <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> of it reaches over the Cliff. But there is something I want to say to you, more interesting to me than the Picturesque. Something that my heart is set on. About your coming to see London. I know <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would make no difficulty&#x02014;for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sake if for nothing else!&#x02014; It is that calmly obstinate Husband of yours, who carries his love of home to such excess, that is the &#x0201c;Lion in the way&#x0201d;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 26:13.</note> for my imagination. Yet if he knew how much good I expect to get of having you in London with me, and what efforts I will make to repay him for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> effort; he who is so kind&#x02014;so obliging&#x02014;to the poorest old women of the countryside&#x02014;will surely not resist my entreaties.</p>
<p>You are to understand that besides the pleasure of the thing to me, your coming at the time I ask you would be doing me a <hi rend="italic">real service</hi>.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is going on his travels, shortly after our return to London from this place&#x02014;some two or three weeks hence, if all goes right <hi rend="italic">here</hi>&#x02014;and I am to be left <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> at Chelsea. Accompanying him would not suit me at all&#x02014;indeed several of the houses he is going to could not receive us both at a time as we need <hi rend="italic">two</hi> bedrooms. And then I should prefer doing <hi rend="italic">my outing</hi> (as the Londoners call it) in Autumn  So I shall be alone, needing company&#x02014;and of all company I should like best the Drs and <hi rend="small-caps">yours!</hi></p>
<p>Then; when <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is away I have plenty of House room, which is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the case when he is at home; seeing that he occupies two floors of the House &#x0201c;all to himself&#x0201d;!&#x02014; And I have my time all to myself to show you all about London, and my carriage to take you wherever you liked! Oh my Dear it would be so nice!&#x02014; I have heard you say the D<hi rend="italic">r could</hi> leave the Bank<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201c;Dr. Russell&#x02019;s special employment for years back was superintendence of a country bank; but his gratis practice of <hi rend="italic">medicine</hi>, and of every helpful thing in that region, continued and continues (<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>)&#x0201d; (TC&#x02019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:250).</note> for a <hi rend="italic">fortnight</hi> whe[n]ever he liked&#x02014; Well? if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could not stay longer than a fortnight. he might bring you up, and see and do all that could be seen and done in one fortnight and then leave you for a good while longer. You would have no difficulty in going back alone the road you <hi rend="italic">had come</hi>&#x02014;or I might find some one going that direction to take charge of you&#x02014;or&#x02014;if you were very good and staid long enough I would go and take charge of you myself and stay&#x02014;not three months next time (!) but a week or two. Oh my Darling it would make <pb id="pg-41-186" n="41:186"/>me so glad! Surely surely you and the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> will not refuse me. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle spoke of writing to you himself to to<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Repeated by JWC.</note> beg the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and you to come and take as good care of me at Chelsea, in his absence, as you had taken of me at Holmhill.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201c;Alas! they never came&#x0201d; (TC&#x02019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:250).</note> He has a fixed idea that he owes my life to your and the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, cares and <hi rend="italic">cheering</hi> But he would defer writing till he had <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> the <hi rend="italic">precise time</hi> for his starting northword. And <hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> cannot <hi rend="italic">wait</hi> to know whether my wish is to be granted me!</p>
<p>He is going first to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Aitken. And if you had seen the letters she has written, urging him <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to wait for the Devonshire visit; but to &#x0201c;come away at once&#x0201d;&#x02014;Cutting <hi rend="italic">me</hi> out of the journey and change which was expected to do me so much good, with as much indifference as if she had quite forgotten my existence! you would understand at last why I am so aggravated by that woman. Indeed it is not one letter out of a dozen, she writes to her Brother, that mentions my existence or indicates the slightest remembrance of it!</p>
<p>Now Darling write to me at once&#x02014;or no!&#x02014;wait two days; in case your or the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> first impulse should be to refuse me&#x02014;and remember that you have it in your power to make me happy or to make me&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">cry</hi>!&#x02014; If the D<hi rend="italic">r will</hi> absolutely <hi rend="italic">not</hi> leave Home&#x02014;(my heart dies in me, when I think over the instances of obstinacy I have seen in that man!&#x02014;about the photograph<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Dr. Russell refused to be photographed; otherwise unexplained.</note>
 &#x26;c &#x26;c) <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are not obliged to disappoint me&#x02014; <hi rend="italic">He</hi> could go to Carlisle with you and put you into a carriage out of which you would never need to move till you reached Euston Square where I would receive you into my protecting arms! What <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have done so often alone surely <hi rend="italic">you</hi> could do alone&#x02014; I think it will be towards the end of April that I should want you&#x02014;should have a bed, fit to hold you and the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, gaping <hi rend="italic">ready</hi>! But I will tell you particularly&#x02014;so soon as I know&#x02014;</p>
<p>Oh Mary dear <hi rend="italic">be</hi> kind, and kiss the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> till he says you shall both come!</p>
<p>Lady A has had to go off this morning for three days into Cornwall&#x02014; She asked M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to escort her and he&#x02014;&#x02014;refused!!! &#x0201c;shouldn&#x02019;t be able to sleep &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x0201d;! There is a Sir Walter and Lady Trevillian staying with us till she returns.</p>

<salute>My own darling Betty!</salute>
<p>Thanks, from the bottom of my heart, for your letter, which was all the more pleasure to me that I was not expecting such an effort from you. I know how difficult it is, to concentrate one&#x02019;s thoughts and put them into written sentences, when one is full of sorrow or pain! to do it at all, one must hold very dear the person one writes to! And you and I hold one another very dear by that, and by other tokens. When my bodily torments were nearly greater than I could bear, and I had dropt all correspondences in the outer world, I recollect of writing a few lines to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>; and now, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> write to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> when bowed down with sorrow as I was with pain!</p>
<p>Dear Thomas Erskine wrote me a kind letter about you after he had seen you. He told me the <hi rend="italic">manner</hi> of George&#x02019;s end.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Braid d. <date when="1865-02-10">10 Feb.</date>; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18650214-JWC-BB-01">JWC to BB, <date when="1865-02-14">14 Feb.</date></ref></note> In my life I never heard anything so Sad!&#x02014;and yet how merciful!</p>
<p>Yes, Dear! be sure I shall make M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Duncan&#x02019;s acquaintance if ever an opportunity offers. She has <hi rend="italic">two</hi> irresistible claims on my regard; the one her likeness to my Mother, the other her kindness to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.</p>
<p>I was not thinking of a journey to Scotland this summer, until I had the news of your loss. <hi rend="italic">Now</hi>, I should like to go, that you might see the <hi rend="italic">child</hi> <pb id="pg-41-188" n="41:188"/>remaining to you,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC herself.</note> which would be a comfort to you, would it not? If I were not still in such weak health, that I can stand no knocking about, I should decide to go. For M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, who has lately finished the great Book, in six big volumes, which has kept him busy for ten years, is going to Scotland in a little while, and to pay several visits up and down; so that I should not be needed at home. And it would be too much fatigue going from place to place along with <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, besides that, among his own people, there is not accommodation for us both at one time&#x02014;as we are both bad sleepers and need a room a-piece! So, if I had but strength for it, there would be nothing to hinder me from going back to Thornhill&#x02014;and and<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word repeated in MS.</note>
 on for a few days to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. To Thornhill is not a difficult journey, and there is such beautiful rest and welcome at the end of it! and I should find just the same welcome this year, as if I had not staid near <hi rend="italic">three months</hi> there (!) last year. But the journey from Thornhill to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is more complicated and bothering. And I dont feel at home with my Aunts<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x02019;s aunts Ann, Elizabeth, and Grace, in Edinburgh.</note> as I do with the Russells. I need a great many tender attentions now, which I could perfectly dispense with when I was stronger, and it is not <hi rend="italic">in</hi> my Aunts to be <hi rend="italic">tender</hi> towards anybody! However&#x02014;we shall see! perhaps as the weather gets warmer I may be less of an Invalid. Meanwhile I have written to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell to beg her to come to me,&#x02014;and the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> if possible,&#x02014;in London; when M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C goes north, and leaves house room for them. After showing them London I would <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> return with them I said&#x02014;as an inducement to their coming!</p>
<p>At present we are on a visit to Lady Ashburton in Devonshire; so your letter did not reach me till yesterday. As we left London on Wednesday&#x02014;forgetting to leave the address with the Postman. I had been much plagued with a constant nausea for some time, and was glad to get a change of air and scene, which the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> say is the only remedy for nervous illness; and certainly <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is my own experience.</p>
<p>I am just as much at home with Lady Ashburton as with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell. They are the two kindest hostesses on Earth. So I doubt not but I shall improve here, so soon as my sleep gets settled; which is always driven away by a new bed.</p>
<p>The House is within a hundred yards of the edge of a high Cliff, overhanging the Sea. So we have fresh air enough! The Country all round is extremely beautiful, and new to me. Chiefly I am delighted to see <hi rend="italic">clear</hi>, <hi rend="italic">running</hi> waters&#x02014;like what we have in Scotland&#x02014;also the wee lambs, quite <hi rend="italic">white</hi>, are a treat to see, after the sooty sheep near London!</p>
<p>We shall stay here some two or three weeks.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-41-189" n="41:189"/>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle was for me <hi rend="italic">not</hi> continuing to send <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi>&#x02014;as the sight of it might make you sorry.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles had regularly sent copies of <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> for George; see <ref target="volume-38/18620812-JWC-TC-01"><sic>38:136</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-08-12">12 Aug. 1862</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> But I thought your Husband<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Braid.</note> might care to look at it&#x02014;and at all rates that you took the address in my handwriting as an assurance of my welfare.</p>
<p>God bless and comfort you Dear!</p>

<salute>Dear Cunningham,</salute>
<p>We are come down hither, my Wife and I, for a little visit to friends and the Country air; and I think shall be back before very long. So far as my own guess can extend, the National-Portrait people ought to have no feeling but gladness and gratitude towards the pious contribution you intend for them: but perhaps our best way will be not to stir farther in the matters till I come home, &#x26;can report that I have seen the Bust with approval;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were three busts of Allan Cunningham: by Richard Westmacott Jr. (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>; <ref target="volume-41/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29115"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), professor of sculpture at the Royal Academy <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x02013;<date when="1867-00-00">67</date>, exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>, otherwise untraced; by Henry Weekes (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x02013;<date when="1877-00-00">77</date>; <ref target="volume-41/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28969"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), sculptor; and by Sir Francis Leggatt Chantrey (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x02013;<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; <ref target="volume-41/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5113"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), sculptor.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x02014;</salute>It is really a shame that in the utterly idle life I am leading here, there has not already been time found for a little scrap of Answer to the Note you sent. Twelve days here, and except a line on the second morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, not a word of report to the only friends in the world that are truly interested in our good and evil! One reason is, we are not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> got into the fair road, or feasible course of habitudes in this new scene; and have nothing that is fairly satisfactory and pleasant and successful to send you. &#x0201c;New habits&#x0201d;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430518-TC-CHDI-01"><sic>16:172</sic><corr>TC to [CHDI], <date when="1843-05-18">18 May 1843</date></corr></ref>; cf. also the Carlyles&#x02019; use of &#x0201c;hefted&#x0201d; [accustomed], <corr>i.e.</corr> &#x0201c;hefted to our new element&#x0201d; (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530409-TC-MAC-01"><sic>28:103</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1853-04-09">9 April 1853</date></corr></ref>) and &#x0201c;hefted in my new position&#x0201d; (<ref target="volume-15/lt-18420814-JWC-TC-01"><sic>15:14</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1842-08-14">14 Aug. 1842</date>]</corr></ref>).</note> oh what a botherat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to a poor old lazy worn-out being is all that! Hitherto I cannot for my life get over those extraordinary <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> arrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>, or know how to pick out <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> and a support to the digestive depart<hi rend="italic">t</hi> from such a <hi rend="italic">quantis non egeo</hi> [how many things I do not need], arranged at such hours. Breakfast at 10 till near 11 (omelets, fries, steaks, chops,&#x02014;cup of coffee always cold, egg d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> and half raw, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> with half a hundred <hi rend="italic">no, thank you</hi>&#x02019;s is my share of the lot); then luncheon, excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> solid dinner at 2 p.m. (i.e. in ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 3 hours),&#x02014;to me entirely impossible,&#x02014;then at 5 tea; and at 7&#xbd; till 9, <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi> proper,&#x02014;that is to say, the food of the day to be swalled<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; presumably for &#x0201c;swallowed.&#x0201d;</note> within 2 hours of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> going to bed! I cannot yet find out a <hi rend="italic">way</hi>; but I will &#x26;must or else&#x02014;&#x02014;! Poor Jane, who seemed to manage much better than I, is today flung down with &#x0201c;sick headache&#x0201d; (poor little soul) and is lying quiet in bed, as yet (1 p.m.) with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> breaking fast. Alas, alas!&#x02014; But I flatter myself it will soon change in her case. And that in fact we shall <hi rend="italic">all</hi> come to some kind of supportable <hi rend="italic">ship shape</hi>, and be able to get the benefit of this beautiful wholesome country, swift poney-exercise, and the warmest <hi rend="italic">hospitality</hi> possible for human nature even of the Highland type!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Till yesterday, the Trevellyans were here (people whom you know, &#x26;who remember you well); Sir W<hi rend="italic">r</hi> has escorted me on various poney-rides; a man that knows every inch of the country, knows geology, antiquity, all the Ologies &#x26;Sciences, and is a heartily courteous honest and good man,&#x02014;not nearly so dull as he looks at starting. Day before yesterday the Trevellyans withdrew to their own Lodging in the Village, to make room for &#x0201c;the Woolners&#x0201d; here,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas and Alice Woolner. Thomas Woolner wrote to Emily Tennyson, <date when="1865-03-24">24 March</date>. &#x0201c;I returned last night from Seaton, having spent a most pleasant time. Lady Ashburton was kindness itself and there was no state or grandeur. Carlyle was charming, and his talk was interesting in every way; he, Sir W. Trevelyan and I used to go out riding together nearly every day. &#x02026; [H]e said that as soon as the Seaforth Lodge engagement was over he was due in Scotland to stay with some of his family for a long time, and he does not expect to be back before the end of autumn or something like that, so that I shall be all that time without seeing the dear old philosopher&#x0201d; (Woolner 258&#x02013;59).</note> <pb id="pg-41-191" n="41:191"/>whom I cannot reckon an improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.

The Lady here is certainly the kindest of all Hostesses;&#x02014;discovering yesterday by accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that her dining-hour (7&#xbd; or 7&#xbe; p.m.) did not quite suit my custom, she has insisted on <hi rend="italic">changing</hi> it to 6&#xbd;, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> really is a great deal suitabler:&#x02014;and this is only one of all manner of instances that might be given.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton wrote to Lord Houghton, <date when="1865-03-17">17 March</date>. &#x0201c;The dear Carlyles are here.

Poor weak soul; so full of vivacity &#x26;shift when there is any chance at all!</p>
<p>This is the beautifullest country possible: swift brooks &#x26;rivers (clear and lively, not <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> to Scotch, but agreeably reminding you); everywhere Hill &#x26;Dale, all cultivated, hedged &#x26;trimmed to the very summits; strong ancient-looking quiet little Towns, and such Hamlets &#x26;villages in their curious old nooks as are quite a pleasure to look upon after huge London &#x26;its screameries. I have a little demon of a black Pony, fit to gallop to all lengths; I go out riding daily (oftenest with some kind of company, but quite as willingly with none): this is the one <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> act I do in the 24 hours; the rest of my time I am grieved to say is one tract of idleness, waste laziness, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is shameful to think of! I look forward to Scotland were the Spring tempests done. Ah me, I am often very sad, if that c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> help me at all!&#x02014; I know not whether the Book is out or not; but suppose it is a day or two ago. No matter whatever.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I wrote to you on Friday; but reflected soon after that you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not get my Letter till <hi rend="italic">this</hi> pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> (Monday) morning: I therefore wrote also a word to Jean, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> our gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> wellbeing, in hopes she might get her Note much ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the same time, and not need to wait for the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> one. It has since occurred to me, as a scarcely pardonable omission, that I took no notice of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lady-Hamilton<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Janet Hamilton, b. Marshall (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x02013;<date when="1877-00-00">77</date>), widow of Sir William Hamilton (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x02013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>; <ref target="volume-41/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12144"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), philosopher, whom TC had known and admired in Edinburgh in the <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>s and <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>s. She lived at 16 Great King St., Edinburgh.</note>
 request. Pardon me; and impute it to the unutterable puddle, of <hi rend="italic">thick ink</hi>, uncomfortable paper (shame on me, for it is gratis too!), a ricketty table, and still worse of unendurable (pretty continual) dyspepsia, want of sleep, and general <hi rend="italic">misery</hi> under arrange<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> that are at once the most munificently hospitable, &#x26;completely unsuccessful for me. Last night was my worst night of all. No use that I gallop 3 hours daily, walk as if for a wager &#x26;c &#x26;c: my life here is as detestable to me as c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> well be imagined;&#x02014;and this very day I think, if it were not that Jane seems to be doing a good deal better and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> object, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be tempted to be off for home. Alas, alas, what a mockery are flunkies, luxuries, endless wealth (presided over by d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> kindness) to unfortunate me, who <pb id="pg-41-194" n="41:194"/><pb id="pg-41-195" n="41:195"/>cannot <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> with my fellow creatures! Last night I lay awake till 6 a.m.; was awoke ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> at 7,&#x02014;and had fairly to take into the bath-tub, thence into the fierce east-wind, and <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> in sheltered lanes for 2 hours instead of sleeping!&#x02014; Tomorrow I expect to get round ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; for all <hi rend="italic">else</hi> is perfection!</p>
<p>Express to Lady Hamilton (with compliments) my very great desire to do anything that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be <hi rend="italic">pious</hi> to the memory of Sir William whom I honour &#x26;love so truly; but the <hi rend="italic">doubt</hi>, very sincere too, whether anything of reminiscence I could practically muster will be practically worth committing to print. I cannot even <hi rend="italic">try</hi>, in my pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> state:&#x02014;say however that I will try; actually so.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is not known why Lady Hamilton wanted TC to write a reminiscence of her husband at this time; a subscription was started this year to fund the Hamilton Philosophical Fellowship at Edinburgh University; John Stuart Mill pbd. his highly critical <hi rend="italic">Examination of Sir William Hamilton&#x02019;s Philosophy</hi> (<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>), late <date when="1865-04-00">April</date>. TC wrote a Reminiscence of William Hamilton in <date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>, which was pbd. in John Veitch, <hi rend="italic">Memoir of Sir William Hamilton, Bart</hi>. (Edinburgh, <date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>) 121&#x02013;27; see also Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 427&#x02013;33.</note> And that is all we have to ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.</p>
<p>This country is beautiful, and might be extremely beneficial &#x26;helpful to me: but if a man cannot escape dyspeptic wretchedness by any mode of eating, nor count on sleep as the close of his day&#x02019;s laborious <hi rend="italic">toil</hi> (in the grateful task of <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> nothing &#x26;enjoying nothing,&#x02014;except slightly a little tobacco),&#x02014;what is to become of him.</p>
<p>The Woolners are still here;&#x02014;I feel as if I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be much better <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, given up to my own gloom: but it will not last. Sir W<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26;Lady<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For a photograph of Sir Walter and Lady Paulina Trevelyan (possibly taken around this time) placed in vol. 2 of JWC&#x02019;s albums, see <sic>opp.</sic><corr>above.</corr> TC later wrote underneath the photograph: &#x0201c;Sir Walter Trevellyan, &#x26;his (first) Wife:&#x02014;(in Devonshire with <hi rend="italic">us</hi>; ah me!).&#x0201d;</note> are the most excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> people, and they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> too near me. Courage: I will add no more today. Forgive me dear Brother;&#x02014;&#x26;don&#x02019;t <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> any of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> pity. At bottom, I believe I am really somewhat <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than when we left Town. Yes, truly so, in spite of all!&#x02014;<figure><graphic url="volume-41-194-22.gif"/><p>Sir Walter and Lady Paulina Trevelyan, ca. 1865</p><p><hi rend="italic">Courtesy of Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Columbia University</hi></p></figure></p>
<p>Many Letters have followed me out hither,&#x02014;but with the small exception of yours and Jean&#x02019;s, they are by impertinent people, partly <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>men, partly beggars &#x26;c &#x26;c.</p>
<p>Larkin, for one, announces that with an effort approaching the superhuman he has, at last, in 3 months, <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> his Index &#x26;c, &#x26;that the Book is to be &#x0201c;out <hi rend="italic">next</hi> week.&#x0201d; From me, <hi rend="italic">altum silentium</hi> [great silence] in that direct<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. On the whole, if the violent weather were past, I must try Scotland, &#x26;so be at the end.</p>
<p>Adieu, dear Brother: did you ever read such a Letter? Victory over Fr<hi rend="italic">k</hi>, has not hitherto led to Goshen,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 46 and 47; after many years of famine, Israel and his children came to live in Egypt, in the rich and fertile land of Goshen.</note> you perceive!</p>

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x02014;</salute>I got y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter yesterday morning; and very welcome it was to me, among the heap of others, mostly mad &#x26;useless to me. I have recovered my sleeping faculty (so far as <hi rend="italic">in</hi>dispensable); that is, I make out some five or 6 bad hours of it by night; <hi rend="italic">eking</hi>, in the way you hint, a half hour or a 10 minutes now and then by day: so that, what with galloping two hours ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the breezy lanes, what with strict attention to diet, and suffering in abstaining, I rub along better or worse&#x02014; The Woolners went on Thursday; but lo, next day, the Trevelyans, to entertain <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, were bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> back! There is a Miss Dempster (from Forfarshire)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a member of the Dempster family from Dunnichen, Forfarshire, with connections to Skibo, Sutherland (near Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s family home); unidentified further.</note> really a pretty phenomenon; an actual young Lady cleverish, handsome, and of the perfect Scotch type: she is our best achiev<hi rend="italic">t</hi> at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. I caught face-ache, gum-ache, <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> a &#x0201c;scene of Loveliness&#x0201d; (Cleaveland I think they call it, 7 miles off);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced; Woolner wrote to Emily Tennyson, <date when="1865-03-24">24 March</date>. &#x0201c;I went on Wednesday to see Clevelands &#x02026; and it was without exception to my mind, the loveliest place I have ever seen even as it stands now; so that what it must be in the time of the leaf surpasses my imagination to perceive&#x0201d; (Woolner 258&#x02013;59). Clearly not Clevelands House, Axmouth, about 3 mi. from Seaton, but its old name of Pinhay House, also the name of Pinhay Bay and Pinhay Cliffs (to the W of the bay), about 3 mi. (6 km.) E of Seaton, might have led to some confusion. TC and Woolner might have ridden along the cliffs to the bay and seen the grounds surrounding Pinhay House, built <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>, just W of Lyme Regis.</note> but have kept resolutely quiet ever since. Jane does really rather well,&#x02014;tho with &#x0201c;headache&#x0201d; pretty constant; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she says is new to her, but better than what it has displaced. The Lady Hostess excels in warmth of hospitality all Ladies: on the whole, I am getting no mischief, the contrary rather;&#x02014;nevertheless I call it really good news wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have got to tell you (what is the summary of this Note), <hi rend="italic">That it is settled we are to return home on Saturday next</hi>. Saturday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>: if you have a little word lying for us then, it will be very welcome, &#x26;we shall read it in our old moorings ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.</p>
<p>I am a little disappointed to have heard nothing from Dumfries.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>We have been on these Southern Coasts for a three weeks past, among friends, in a friendlier climate; but are for coming home on Saturday next. Some evening after that, pretty much any evening, tea will be in progress at 8 o&#x02019;clock, and a welcome ready, if you please to venture to experiment. I had heard already that Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Fearn was safe thro&#x02019;,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Williams Walker Fearn accompanied Thompson on his first visit to the Carlyles, <date when="1864-10-14">14 Oct. 1864</date>; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641018-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [ca. <date when="1864-10-18">18 Oct.</date>]</ref>. He returned to the Confederacy late <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>.</note>
&#x02014;a very welcome bit of intelligence to my Wife &#x26;me. Send him our respects &#x26;kind wishes when you have opportunity.</p>
<p>Last night, y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Charleston was read, to her company, by the Lady of this House (who herself takes in <hi rend="italic">The Index</hi>);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Index: A Weekly Journal of Politics, Literature, and News</hi>, Confederate propaganda newspaper, pbd. London <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>&#x02013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>. The <date when="1865-03-23">23 March</date> issue contained a historical account of Charleston from the original English settlement of <date when="1672-00-00">1672</date> to its evacuation by Confederate forces in <date when="1865-02-00">February 1865</date>: &#x0201c;the &#x02018;capture of Charleston&#x02019; in the strict sense of the term never was accomplished by their fleets and armies. &#x02026; Charleston never did surrender. No demand was made for her surrender. No one was probably more surprised than the Federal commander himself to discover that the sad, silent, sorrowful, ruinous, beautiful city of magnolias, which had so long repelled the approaches of the invader on land and sea &#x02026; had suddenly been deserted by its defenders. &#x02026; The Confederate forces had folded their tents &#x02026; and stolen silently away.&#x0201d;</note>
 and tragically interesting we all found it. My expectat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is, and that of most people whom I see, that the &#x0201c;Conquest of the South&#x0201d; is no whit nearer than ever; nay my own private <pb id="pg-41-198" n="41:198"/>conjecture is that if perhaps Gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Lee<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Edward Lee (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x02013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>), Confederate general, commander of the Army of Northern Virginia <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>&#x02013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>.</note> were on the <hi rend="italic">field</hi> (and no longer in a city) with his Army,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. Lee and his army had been defending the city of Richmond, Va., the Confederate capital, for the previous nine months.</note> and happened to have (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am assured is the fact) something of Strategic Faculty and actual knowledge of campaigning,&#x02014;he might work such woes on those Yankee Gentleman as w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be miraculous to the Editorial mind! &#x0201c;Generals&#x0201d; are not to be made by clapping cocked hats on them; and &#x0201c;Creation&#x0201d; objects to be &#x0201c;whipped&#x0201d; by a War-ministry of Able Editors. You have a boundless extent of Territory for battlefield; a ditto of <hi rend="italic">Nescience</hi> on the part of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Enemies: unless you yourselves lose heart, it has always seemed to me, &#x26;still seems, their Enterprise is impossible. Alas, alas; I never heard of such a War in all my reading; I believe in the annals of the Human Species there was never such another!&#x02014;</p>

<salute>Dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren</salute>
<p>We have made out our visit, you see, with greater deliberation than I predicted, in leaving! Not that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> talked of <hi rend="italic">being off</hi> &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">this very day</hi>,&#x0201d; every morning after a restless night! And he has had too many of these; since his habits have been turned all heels over head, and there has been no punctual M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren at hand to <hi rend="italic">measure</hi> out his dinners!&#x02014; So I have been in constant uncertainty all the time; and no woman living hates uncertainty more than I do! It would spoil my pleasure in Heaven itself!</p>
<p>Tho&#x02019; I am in no haste to go, then; and never wearying of either the <hi rend="italic">Sea</hi> or Lady Ashburton; still it is a sort of a melancholy satisfaction to know, that our departure is finally <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> for Saturday next.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201c;Saturday next&#x0201d; was <date when="1865-04-01">1 April</date>.</note>&#x02014; When, I hope to find you well, and glad to see us! And to find the kitchen smartened up, and the cistern cured of leaking!</p>
<p>I dont know yet what hour we shall arrive; but it will probably be in time for a late dinner. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C likes mutton-broth after a journey, and <hi rend="italic">I like</hi>&#x02014;&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>!! so I can dine with <hi rend="italic">Him</hi> that day. And you must get in things for Sunday; but I need not be telling <hi rend="italic">you</hi> what to do; for, thank God, you have <hi rend="italic">sense</hi>; which is not so common a qualification as one might think! Oh dear me! there <pb id="pg-41-199" n="41:199"/>hasn&#x02019;t been a day here, that I have not wished I could have brought one half of you with me, and left the other half to take care of the House! The times and times I have been put into a rage is quite disgraceful!</p>
<p>Please tell the Postman of our coming; in time to prevent his sending off the letters that may come on Saturday.</p>
<closer><salute>Good by! / Yours kindly</salute></closer>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>We are very glad to hear of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> return;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From his travels for the Asylum Commission; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18650215-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1865-02-15">15 Feb.</date></ref></note> and you have written me a very kind and very welcome Letter,&#x02014;for wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, doubt not, there is due gratitude, in the silent form. Truly, if all readers were possessed of the sense and patient candour of Forster, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> thing to write big Books!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster had presumably just received his copy of the final two vols. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>; John A. Carlyle wrote to his nephew James Carlyle, <date when="1865-03-27">27 March</date>. &#x0201c;The two vols of Frederick have come for the Libraries here, &#x26;I know not why our copies are delayed&#x0201d; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note>
 But they (i.e. readers) by no means are; on the contrary they are a miscellany of blockheads by the hundred and of Forsters by the decimal part of a unit;&#x02014;and in fact the <pb id="pg-41-200" n="41:200"/>only thing one can handsomely do is to forget their existence altogether, and be thankful that one is alive, delivered into daylight ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, on the other side of the hill from them. I incline, in sincerity, to the private opinion that this is a Book much unsuitable to them: nay that it is in itself a baddish Book,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; verily it is the best I could make it; and has been a job, <hi rend="italic">wh</hi>h, blessed be Heaven, I have now done with to all Eternity! Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> latter is a most comfortable reflexion for the rest of my existence.</p>
<p>My best news out of these parts is, that we have got no mischief by the adventure, nay the poor Wife if not myself too has evidently rather profited; and that we are all coming home <hi rend="italic">on Saturday next</hi>, if it please Heaven! The coasts and countries hereabouts are very beautiful: chalk cliffs with azure or sea-green Ocean singing its world-old Song at the base; excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> hills and vallies, with the blessedest old villages nestled in the hollows watered by clear-flowing brooks,&#x02014;everywhere a silence, a solitude, a purity of sky and earth, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, to a denizen of London soot, London mud &#x26;noise of madness day and night, is strangely pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.

The Wife has her old spell of driving; oftenest with company she likes. Poor Mrs F. &#x26;her cold!

<p>I give you now, Dear, the only piece of news I have had to give since I went away, viz., that we are coming home on Saturday. It is very perverse of Mr. C. to be in such haste, seeing that we are only now beginning to feel the benefit of the change, and that we are not wished to go. Indeed a more cordial, more generous Hostess than Lady A. does not I believe exist on this Planet! Every time I see her I like her better than last time; and she seems more kind to me, tho&#x02019; that had seemed impossible.</p>
<p>But I will tell you all about everything by word of mouth&#x02014;which is much <pb id="pg-41-201" n="41:201"/>easier than with pen and ink. Writing continues a horrid bore to me; and if Letters from me have &#x0201c;been flying about,&#x0201d; I can only say they have flown very wide apart, and with very drooping wings!</p>
<p>Oh, what a Place this is for lovers of the Picturesque! Such a sea! Such cliffs! the one so blue, the other so white! My head was quite turned at first, with all this &#x0201c;beautiful nature&#x0201d;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590709-JWC-JGCO-01"><sic>35:139</sic><corr>JWC to JGCO, [<date when="1859-07-09">9 July 1859</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> and I had a &#x0201c;moment of enthusiasm&#x0201d; in which I was near persuading Mr. C. to buy a Devonshire Craigenputtoch to be sold extraordinarily cheap! Pine trees, and wild heaths, and black bog! a hundred acres of it; and in the midst, a charming House built in the style of a Convent!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Woolner wrote to Emily Tennyson, <date when="1865-03-24">24 March</date> &#x0201c;Last Tuesday the whole party made an expedition to the house I told you of (St. Mary&#x02019;s), and had luncheon in the open air, on the step of the terrace on which the house stands. &#x0002f; Carlyle has given up the notion of buying it, but says that if he were ten years younger and able to enter a new kind of life he should not wish a happier looking spot. The house is built of solid stone; the rooms are wainscoted all round, the ceilings also are of pine polished; and most beautifully finished throughout. There are 100 acres of land with a cottage for farm man &#x26;c., and the price asked is &#x000a3;2000&#x0201d; (Woolner 258).</note>
 The speculation was wrecked by my answering to Mr. C.&#x02019;s fear I should &#x0201c;die of the Solitude, in six months,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Oh, no! for I will keep constant company.&#x0201d; George 2<hi rend="italic">d&#x02019;s</hi> &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">Non!

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x02014;&#x02014;</salute>We got home, not on Saturday as had been anticipated, but on Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (our Lady Hostess having put in a new plea that she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> herself accompany us <hi rend="italic">then</hi>): we all had a pleasant enough ride thro&#x02019; the beautiful Spring Country; and c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say, Jane &#x26;I, that we seemed to have got no hurt by the sojourn on the South Shore. Since Monday (owing partly to her Ladyship) there has been such a racket of hurries as rarely was; so that poor Jane has suffered a little (tho&#x02019; still gate-going &#x26;cheery poor weak creature);&#x02014;and I myself have at this moment <hi rend="italic">no</hi> time at all for what I am doing! Happily the worst is over: impetuous Lady A. is as good as gone ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; I myself &#x0201c;(sitting for my bust&#x0201d; &#x26;c) shall be quite loose this day week,&#x02014;and will very seriously indeed consider when I can come to Scotland. The sooner the better I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say, if this beautiful weather do but hold (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it won&#x02019;t and can&#x02019;t!)&#x02014; However, I believe I actually shall not <hi rend="italic">be long</hi> now.</p>
<p>It delights me to think of you at poor old Scotsbrig:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their brother James Carlyle had a small cyst between his eyebrow and eyelid, and John A. Carlyle wrote with advice to James Carlyle Jr., <date when="1865-02-25">25 Feb.</date>: &#x0201c;In my young days the lancing of such tumours was done <hi rend="italic">from the outside</hi>, but the usual plan now is to do it <hi rend="italic">from the inside</hi> turning back the eyelid, &#x26;then touching with the caustic before letting the eyelid fall down to its usual position. No other treatment than lancing would do any good. The caustic destroys the little cyst, &#x26;so prevents it from filling again. I would advise your Father to have the thing done without any unnecessary delay, as the tumour would irritate the eye if it became larger.&#x0201d; It is not clear whether James took this treatment, but John wrote, <date when="1865-03-27">27 March</date>: &#x0201c;I was glad to hear by your last letter that your Father&#x02019;s eye was getting better; &#x26;I should like to hear if the little lump still continues to get smaller.&#x0201d; John A. Carlyle wrote to James Carlyle Sr., <date when="1865-03-27">29 March</date>: &#x0201c;Please meet me there [Dumfries] on the Friday or at the Gill on the Saturday for I want to see your eye again &#x26;ascertain how it is going on. I expect to be at Dumfries by one o&#x02019;clock on Friday. Jean wants you to stay with us over the Sunday at The Hill, as she has &#x02018;seen little of you for a long time past &#x26;wishes much to have some talk with you.&#x02019; Do accept her invitation if you can&#x0201d; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086); presumably Jean decided to visit James at Scotsbrig instead.</note> repairing rents &#x26;<pb id="pg-41-205" n="41:205"/><hi rend="italic">button</hi> work; sauntering ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in silence or trustful talk, in old haunts wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are so interesting to us all!

<salute>Dear Miss Smith,</salute>
<p>I am always glad to hear from you, and like to read your verses; tho&#x02019; I often wish you had taken to writing practical <hi rend="italic">prose</hi>, rather, that is, for <hi rend="italic">your own</hi> sake. There is so little appreciation for poetry in these &#x0201c;hard times,&#x0201d; and, alas! so little remuneration for it; while the appetite for magazine <hi rend="italic">Tales</hi> and three-volume novels is getting to be a positive lupus<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clearly not the current meaning of &#x0201c;lupus,&#x0201d; the immune system disease; probably the voracious appetite of a wolf; cf. &#x0201c;dog appetite&#x0201d; (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi>).</note>&#x02014;&#x02014;? something! I forget the full medical name of that disease which makes the victim gobble up, with unslaked voracity, pounds on pounds of raw beef and tallow candles! or anything that comes readiest.</p>
<p>I returned to London&#x02014;by Carlisle again&#x02014;about three months after I saw you,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This meeting must have taken place on JWC&#x02019;s journey north, when she breakfasted in Carlisle, <date when="1864-07-14">14 Jul. 1864</date> (see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640715-JWC-TC-01"><sic>40:133</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1864-07-15">15 July [1864]</date></corr></ref>); Mary Smith described her last meeting with JWC: &#x0201c;The last time I saw her, after the first salutation&#x02014;still holding my hand, and leading me to the couch on which she sat&#x02014;she said kindly; &#x02018;Come and sit ye down by me, and tell me all about yourself; what ye&#x02019;ve been doing, and how ye&#x02019;re getting on.&#x02019; So she sat me down close to beside her, and told me many things about herself and home, and Thomas, as she invariably called him. Before leaving, she said: &#x02018;I suppose you come to London sometimes. Everybody comes. Now, whenever ye do, be sure to come to Chelsea to see us&#x0201d; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 1:246). This was probably the <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date> meeting as JWC only stopped for around two hours on her last visit to Scotland, traveling via Carlisle, <date when="1865-06-16">16</date>&#x02013;<date when="1865-06-17">17 June 1865</date> (see vol. 42). Mary Smith also described a July meeting, sometime between <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date> and <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>, possibly this same one though she implies otherwise: &#x0201c;Dr. John Carlyle came down to Finkle-street once to fetch me to see Mrs. Carlyle. It was July, and he was dressed in loose light clothing, very old fashioned in make, and a white hat. When I got to the County Hotel, I found him walking up and down in front, fearing, as he said, lest I should go to the wrong place&#x0201d; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 1:245).</note> but I could not ask you to meet me at the station, even [if] it hadn&#x02019;t been <pb id="pg-41-206" n="41:206"/>too late at night. I felt too sick and nervous from the parting with my friends, and the long night journey before me, and the return in the morning to my poor old home, which I had been <hi rend="italic">carried</hi> out of eight months before, with no particle of hope that I should ever set eyes on it again! I felt a sacred horror of the house in which I had suffered such tortures and such despair.</p>
<p>But so much had been done to change the aspect of my rooms, and I was received back with such enthusiasm,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC traveled home from Scotland overnight <date when="1864-09-30">30 Sept. 1864</date>, having left Cheyne Row for St. Leonards, then Holmhill, <date when="1864-03-08">8 March 1864</date>; she was received home with great enthusiasm by TC and her maids; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18640308-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1864-10-03">3 Oct. 1864</date>]</ref>.</note>
 that all my morbid repugnance soon passed away, and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> changes having a good effect on me, so even the change back to London had a beneficial effect on my health. I am still a very feeble, rather suffering creature, but so much better than I was a year ago, that I can never be thankful enough.</p>
<p>I am just returned from a month&#x02019;s stay in Devonshire, and it was there your letter reached me, when I was being driven thro&#x02019; the loveliest country all days, and wearied to death at nights, so wrote not at all to anybody.</p>
<p>I wish you could have given me better news of yourself; and I wish most heartily that I could aid you in finding some position more suited to your needs and tastes. But my wishes are one thing, and my powers, alas! a quite other thing! At least be sure I will let slip no opportunity of serving you.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Smith wrote later: &#x0201c;No help, in the way I desired, came from my acquaintanceship with Mrs. Carlyle, and yet it was a help. I felt that I had been recognized as a fellow sufferer with higher and nobler souls than myself, and I felt encouraged and strengthened to hope and hold on my way&#x0201d; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 1:247).</note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am dawdling along here, in a very idle way; tied up so far, till the end of this week, by a daily journey to Welbeck Street,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Thomas Woolner&#x02019;s studio.</note>

<salute>Dear Larkin,</salute>
<p>We are got home from the Country; and I have at length got sight of the Book in its complete state, and have been looking over it hither and thither,&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">your</hi> part of it as well, tho&#x02019; not yet with a critical eye. The Plans &#x26;c are very neat and pretty, so much I can testify; nor do I hitherto see above one or two even slight points on wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I could have advised alteration, had there been the freest chance for it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin wrote later: &#x0201c;At last, to the inexpressible relief of all concerned, the index was not merely completed, but printed; and the last volumes of Frederick were published, Carlyle being then away from town on a visit. Soon after his return, I received [this] brief letter of thanks, which (notwithstanding the comparatively stinted, and perhaps slightly injured tone of it), considering all the irritations we had struggled through together, I now prize as highly as any letter he wrote to me. This, at least, was written with clear consciousness of the distance which hopelessly separated us. &#x0002f; After the completion of the general index&#x02014;having faithfully struggled with him, almost with my life in my hands, through what Mrs. Carlyle well called &#x02018;the Valley of the Shadow of Frederick&#x02019;&#x02014;I considered my long apprenticeship to Carlyle fairly and honourably ended. There were many little friendly services which I still continued to render. Perhaps for some time I was there almost as frequently as before; and certainly we never afterwards met in any other spirit than that of the friendliest cordiality&#x0201d; (Larkin, <hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 80&#x02013;81).</note></p>
<p>I am very sensible of the great pains you took, the true wish you have had all along (even in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own confusions and distresses)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC presumably refers to the death of Larkin&#x02019;s baby da., Nora; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640325-TC-JWC-01"><sic>40:44</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1864-03-25">25 March 1864</date></corr></ref>; and possibly also to the Larkins moving at least twice during the preceding year; they moved into the Carlyles&#x02019; house, June to <date when="1864-00-00">July 1864</date>, subletting their house in Cheyne Row; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640715-JWC-TC-01"><sic>40:133</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1864-07-15">15 July [1864]</date></corr></ref>; Larkin then went to stay with his sister while his wife went to Northampton; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640801-TC-JWC-01"><sic>40:161</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1864-08-01">1 Aug. 1864</date></corr></ref>; towards the end of <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date> they moved to their new home (Larkin, <hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 79).</note> to be helpful to me; and your loyalty in this sore Enterprise from first to last is a thing I shall always remember. Let us be thankful we have seen the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of it; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, at one time, and indeed more times than one, seemed almost desperate!&#x02014;</p>
<p>I inclose you a Checque,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC recorded: &#x0201c;<date when="1865-04-13">13 April 1865</date> &#x0002f; to Larkin &#x0002f; (as finis) &#x0002f; &#x000a3;70 .. 0 .. 0&#x0201d; (TC&#x02019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).</note>&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">crossed</hi> so that nobody can steal it;&#x02014;and need not add that if I can ever help you in any honest purpose I gladly will.

<dateline>5 Cheyne Row / <place>Chelsea</place> Good Friday [<date when="1865-04-14">14 April 1865</date>]</dateline>
<p><salute>Oh my Dear!</salute> I have been wanting to write to you every day this week! And hindered by a <hi rend="italic">laziness</hi>, so oppressive as to amount to <hi rend="italic">illness</hi>.</p>
<p>I dont know whether it has been the change from pure sea air to London air, or the change from the cold of winter to the heat of summer, so sudden and extreme!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1865-05-12">12 May</date>, printed a letter claiming that <date when="1865-04-00">April 1865</date> in London was hotter than any April for at least 94 years: &#x0201c;the heat of last month is not only unprecedented, but considerably (2.2 deg,) above the highest previous record. &#x0002f; I may add that the temperature in the sun exceeded 100 deg. [38 C.] on 19 days, and on the 22nd was 125 deg. [52 C.].&#x0201d;</note> or rash exertions I made in the first days of my return, driving about with Lady Ashburton to look at Pictures &#x26;c &#x26;c! or what! But the fact is, I have been in a very poor way, sick, and weak, and sleepless, and pusillanimous! And I can think of nothing to do, beyond taking a blue pill&#x02014;which I have done&#x02014;with no beneficial results. I am now, just <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi>, with what patience I can, and avoiding over fatigue. The last two nights have been a degree less miserable&#x02014;and it is to be hoped I shall come round by degrees.</p>
<p>But how is it that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> so often catch cold? <hi rend="italic">You</hi>&#x02014;with a D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (and just the best of Doctors) &#x0201c;all to yourself&#x0201d; and always beside you? It is clear to me you need a change of air to brace you up&#x02014;and London air would be a complete change from Nithsdale air, as good as another! A friend of mine who lived at a beautiful country House in Lancashire used to fly off for a few days into the smoke of Manchester whenever she got quite out of tone, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> always set her up.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Elizabeth Paulet, b. Newton (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x02013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410719-TC-JWC-01"><sic>13:189</sic><corr>TC to JWC, [<date when="1841-07-19">19 July 1841</date>]</corr></ref>) who had lived at Seaforth House, Seaforth, 4 mi. NNW of Liverpool, rather than Manchester.</note> There is still plenty of time for you to &#x0201c;tak a thoct and mend&#x0201d;&#x02014;and how nice it <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be.

I suppose it will be into May before he can bring himself to lift anchor again&#x02014;So you see it is still time! And, I have positively said <hi rend="italic">No</hi> to Lady A&#x02019;s entreaties that I would go back and take possession of Seaforth Lodge &#x0201c;till winter if I like&#x0201d;&#x02014; <hi rend="italic">She</hi> goes to German <pb id="pg-41-210" n="41:210"/>baths<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton went to Wiesbaden, spa town in SW Germany, late <date when="1865-07-00">July</date>.</note> for her rheumatism and will not be needing the Place till winter.

This letter was to John Watkins, identified by the reference to TC&#x02019;s daguerreotype, taken in a studio in which John had worked. The MS has attached a small cutout of TC&#x02019;s profile, apparently taken from Watkin&#x02019;s profile of TC without a hat (see <!-- 214 -->above). The National Portrait Gallery, London, lists six photographs of TC by Watkins and his brother Charles, &#x0201c;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>s.&#x0201d; NPG also lists several Charles Watkins&#x02019; photographs of TC in a hat, <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>s&#x02013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>s.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Of the nine Photographs, three seem to me excellent, and worthy to be circulated among those curious about them. The rest I will request you to <pb id="pg-41-214" n="41:214"/><pb id="pg-41-215" n="41:215"/>annihilate, tho&#x02019; some of these also are, in parts, highly meritorious. The Three that I wish to live are as follows:</p>
<p>1&#xb0; The big Head, <hi rend="italic">Profile</hi> (or nearly so) <hi rend="italic">with Hat</hi>; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was done on Monday. This I consider to be the truest likeness ever taken of me hitherto.

    <p>I suppose you know that we have been a month in Devonshire with Lady <pb id="pg-41-218" n="41:218" />Ashburton.

What however I am sure you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> know is that in rumageing in those &#x0201c;wardrobe drawers&#x0201d; for long left aside finery; (that I had never expected to need again) to pack a different sort of portmanteau from that <hi rend="italic">little</hi> melancholy one I took, as all my luggage, to Dumfriesshire; I came upon&#x02014;only think:&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">two tags</hi> of your gown! which I remember telling you to look for, as they had been taken off&#x02014; You wouldn&#x02019;t have been so careless, had it been for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> you were looking instead of for yourself! Well I caried these tags in my writing case (!) to Seaton, meaning to inclose them forthwith. And every day they met my eyes, and every day I was so tired with the drivings and dinings and talkings of a Country House that I went to bed every night without having written! Then I came home, just when the weather became insufferably hot, and the sudden heat, or the change from the pure sea air of Seaton to the airlessness of London, or both together, or something else, made me quite ill&#x02014;not <hi rend="italic">nervous</hi> (thank God) but <hi rend="italic">sick</hi>, and sleepless again, and terribly <hi rend="italic">tired</hi> always&#x02014;and incapable of putting pen to paper&#x02014; I have continued my drives for three hours a day; and kept &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">about</hi>.&#x0201d; But it needs the recollections of past horrors of illness to make me patient with the present state.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for the Notes (last of them this morning), for the <hi rend="italic">Sat</hi>y <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> &#x26;c.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The article in <hi rend="italic">The Saturday Review</hi>, <date when="1865-04-22">22 April</date>, began: &#x0201c;The concluding volumes of Mr. Carlyle&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> have appeared, and a premature death cannot now intervene to add one more melancholy example to the long list of great historical works left half finished.&#x0201d; It discussed TC and his admiration for heroes: &#x0201c;Frederick &#x02026; presents many of the qualities which Mr. Carlyle has spent his life in trying to make the world admire. He was very hard-working, very despotic, with a stern purpose to which he succeeded in making other men bend, and full of bulldog courage. &#x02026; But the life of Frederick totally fails to give Mr. Carlyle scope for his power of seizing that which is pious, noble, and good in the characters of pious, noble, and good men. &#x02026; To do things moderately good, with a perfect indifference to the feelings of every one, is the ideal of human life which Mr. Carlyle, amid some waverings, has set himself to preach up for the last thirty years; and Frederick the Great approaches this ideal sufficiently to warrant Mr. Carlyle in choosing him as a representative man.&#x0201d; It continued with praise for TC&#x02019;s attention to detail: &#x0201c;He loves to take the utmost pains to make his geography and his chronology right. He is not satisfied with knowing that Frederick and his army crossed a brook; he wants also to know whether this brook had a gravelly or a muddy bottom. He is not satisfied with knowing that the brook was crossed on such a day of such a month, but he wants also to know what was the hour and the minute. Frederick&#x02019;s history offers an ample field for this sort of labour, for Frederick was continually, for near thirty years, crossing brooks, and the glory and delight of finding out these brooks is much increased by the dismal character of the country where they are to be discovered. &#x02026; In spite of all the pains Mr. Carlyle has taken to make [the Seven Years&#x02019; War] lively, the history of the struggle remains as dreary as ever. It is nothing but a long mournful series of marches across brooks at 2 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi> and into bogs at 5 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi>The brook and the bog are minutely described to us, and the hour precisely noted; but we can neither realize, nor persuade ourselves to care about, the contest.&#x0201d;</note> The latter I found really entertaining in a degree,&#x02014;and greatly superior to some balderdash of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> review of vol. 5, <date when="1865-04-18">18 April</date>, began: &#x0201c;Mr. Carlyle has at length reached the conclusion of his great work, and may repose on his laurels. The great soldier of the 18th century is indebted to him for the best conceivable history of his military exploits and his domestic administration.&#x0201d; The review continued by summarizing the contents of vol. 5 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> very much in the prose style of TC himself, concluding: &#x0201c;Here Mr. Carlyle calls in the aid of Prometheus and the Titans, and at this stage of his ecstacy, at the close of his fifth volume, we leave him.&#x0201d; The review, presumably of vol. 6, was &#x0201c;to be concluded in our next,&#x0201d; but it was apparently not published.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Miss Jewsbury left here one day; and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> <pb id="pg-41-220" n="41:220"/>was totally enigmatic to me till I heard incidentally that the creature who wrote it was <hi rend="italic">given to liquor</hi>, &#x26;had (as I then saw) gone at it raging <hi rend="italic">drunk</hi>!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> Sordid <hi rend="italic">canaille</hi> will be canaillish; why not?&#x02014;</p>
<p>The thing I write ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> today, is to tell you that I find myself still with a &#x000a3;2,000 to <hi rend="italic">invest</hi>; &#x26;sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be privately glad of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> advice ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it. Chorley (apropos of my American outstandings) was, the other day, recommending the <hi rend="italic">Indian Guaranteed</hi> (Something), &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">Gov</hi>t responsible for it, interest on the very border of 5 per cent &#x26;c,&#x0201d; said Chorley: price was only ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x000a3;101 per 100 &#x26;5 <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the percent; but I heeded him little, not knowing at the time that I <hi rend="italic">had</hi>, still to invest.&#x02014; Pray give me advice, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> this &#x0201c;India&#x0201d; or what<hi rend="italic">r</hi> be the advisablest.</p>
<p>I am beginning to think of <hi rend="italic">being</hi> off ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> May 10: but I have not written to Jean yet, to fix the day.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am in great hurry, and in bad <hi rend="italic">fettle</hi> for writing; but must not delay send you a word in reply to Jamie&#x02019;s Letter.</p>
<p>It is bad news to me to hear of the almost impossibility you find in getting farms, while ready to pay a fair rent; especially that you are actually thinking of the likelihood of being obliged to leave Scotsbrig (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> much grieve at); and that you have turned your eyes on such a sad refuge as that of banishment to Craigenputtock<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was increasingly using the spelling &#x0201c;Craigenputtock.&#x0201d;</note> and the Galloway Wilderness far away!</p>
<p>You know very well, dear Brother, how ready I am, and shall at all times be, to do anything for you that I can;&#x02014;and surely a far greater favour than that of &#x0201c;allowing you to offer for Craigenp<hi rend="italic">k</hi>&#x0201d; when it falls vacant might well be expected of me! Clear it is in fact that if you <hi rend="italic">were</hi> in Craigenp<hi rend="italic">k</hi>, and contentedly and prosperously living there, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a very great pleasure to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and a visible increase to my small resources of comfort or enjoy<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for the poor <pb id="pg-41-221" n="41:221"/>remainder of my life. But I much doubt, for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own side of the matter, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very questionable, when you came to approach it practically or to try it. There are some objections to Brother being tenant to Brother (as you well enough know, &#x26;have <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> in my own case):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x02019;s brother Alexander (Alick) had farmed at Craigenputtoch, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x02013;<date when="1831-00-00">31</date>, during the time that TC and JWC lived there; the place was then under the control of Grace Welsh, JWC&#x02019;s mother.</note> but perhaps these are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> insuperable;&#x02014;and in fact it is not these that alone, or perhaps chiefly, raise my doubts in the case. My fear is you might all be rather miserable there, and not &#x0201c;contented&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;prosperous&#x0201d;; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a very sad result to me to witness!</p>
<p>However, we need not prosecute the subject farther just yet: I am just ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> gathering myself for Scotland as you have often heard; and in 3 or 4 weeks I expect to be in my old home, namely in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> old Scotsbrig, once ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>: there will then be opportunity to talk the matter over between ourselves two, till we are fairly at the bottom of it, and have ascertained to the satisfact<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of us both what really can be done in it. Not only an honest, but an honourable, candid, practical &#x26;prudent man I have always found you to be; and I believe we shall be able to arrive at a result wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> both of us can agree to be the right and wise one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I will not mention a world of it to <hi rend="italic">anybody</hi> (Jane excepted, who already knows), nor need any of you; so that it will remain silent between us, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is much the best way for it, being withal so <hi rend="italic">easy</hi> a case.</p>
<p>I have not yet fixed a <hi rend="italic">day</hi> with Jean for Dumfries; but am thinking of the 10th or so of next Month. I must rouse myself, say <hi rend="italic">when</hi>; and get out of this element, the sooner the better. Jean &#x26;I will soon be down at Scotsbrig; &#x26;<hi rend="italic">she</hi> will &#x0201c;do&#x0201d; for me while there.</p>
<p>I have a fine little Horse here, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am thinking of forwarding to Carlisle &#x26;your keeping till I come. &#x0201c;Noggs&#x0201d; they call him: a &#x0201c;little bay chestnut&#x0201d;; hardy as a <hi rend="italic">flint</hi> &#x26;a most innocent useful fellow, tho&#x02019; of (superficially) obstinate &#x26;<hi rend="italic">thrawn</hi> turn of mind. He is in the height of &#x0201c;condition&#x0201d;; higher than he has any need to be: if you have any grass (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will soon be the case) he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be delighted to live on that,&#x02014;passionately likes grass even in the withered state:&#x02014;if you gave him a fair bite of oats twice a day or perhaps once, &#x26;let him run ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> foraging, he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be much obliged to you. I doubt he will have to be <hi rend="italic">sent for</hi> when he arrives at Carlisle? But perhaps the Station-Master at Ecclefechan can tell you whether I can have him booked and paid <hi rend="italic">at London</hi> all the way to the Swaugh or to the Galls:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stations near Ecclefechan; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471002-TC-AC-01"><sic>22:108</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1847-10-02">2 Oct. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 I cannot learn <hi rend="italic">here</hi> with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> difficulty, if well at all. Pray ask, some time soon. I am thoroughly tired of riding the creature <hi rend="italic">here</hi>; &#x26;come he must <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>. Last time I inquired here (years ago), there was only one train for <hi rend="italic">Horseboxes</hi>: 6 in the morning; no other all day.</p>
<p>What a mass of scribble I have put down: ten times more than I intended!&#x02014;</p>

    <salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Duffy.</salute>
    <p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle read in a newspaper ten days ago that you had &#x0201c;returned from Australia&#x0201d;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Charles Gavan Duffy, now living in Australia, was in Europe for an extended holiday; he traveled aboard the <hi rend="italic">Great Victoria</hi>, which arrived from Melbourne <date when="1865-04-11">11 April</date> (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1865-04-12">12 April</date>); the newspaper report of Duffy&#x02019;s arrival untraced.</note> and was &#x0201c;<hi rend="italic">stopping</hi> in London.&#x0201d; I said it couldn&#x02019;t be true; you wouldn&#x02019;t have been many hours in London without coming to see <hi rend="italic">us</hi>!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Duffy recalled later: &#x0201c;For a couple of weeks, I found it impossible to visit Cheyne Row, and my dear old friend Mrs. Carlyle was impatient that I did not find her earlier. &#x02026; In all England, and in all Ireland afterwards, there was but one woman each to welcome me with the frank and cordial salute, and I rejoice always to remember that Mrs. Carlyle was one of the two who so honoured me&#x0201d; (Duffy, <hi rend="italic">My Life</hi> 2:254, 255).</note> But M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C thought otherwise&#x02014;that you might have found no time yet&#x02014;and he desired me to put George Cooke (a friend of ours who can find out everything) on discovering where you were lodged. Had this failed, I suppose he would have advertised for you in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>;&#x02014;if still you had made no sign!</p>
    <p>You may figure then how glad I was, when your letter and basket arrived to me this forenoon, just as I was starting off for my long daily drive. Since I came back, I have done nothing but admire the various presents you have sent me, and think how kind it was of you to collect these things for me so far away!</p>
    <p>But we want to see you! when will you come?</p>

    <p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C says he is going to call for you to morrow morning; but most likely you will be gone out. So it would be best to make an appointment to meet <hi rend="italic">here</hi>&#x02014; At dinner&#x02014;say at six o&#x02019;clock&#x02014;when a Man&#x02019;s day&#x02019;s work is, or ought to be done? Name any day you like? only let it be soon if you please! For I am impatient to see you!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">During the rest of his stay in England, Duffy paid regular visits to Cheyne Row: &#x0201c;On Sunday I generally went to Chelsea, and after a pleasant gossip in the little sitting-room at the foot of the stairs with Madame, I sallied out with Carlyle and walked for several hours in Hyde Park or Battersea Park, talking as of old&#x0201d; (Duffy, <hi rend="italic">My Life</hi> 2:258). During one of these meetings, Duffy later recalled, he asked TC &#x0201c;whether he would follow Frederick by any other historical study. No, he said, he would probably write no more books; writing books was a task to which a man could not be properly encouraged in these times. Modern literature was all purposeless and distracted, and led he knew not where&#x0201d; (Duffy 221). For a photograph of Duffy, probably taken around this time, see <sic>opp.</sic>

       It was photograph 39 in vol. 3 of JWC&#x02019;s photograph albums, and, according to TC&#x02019;s note underneath, it was the last photograph she inserted: &#x0201c;(That is the last of Her insertions).&#x0201d;</note>
