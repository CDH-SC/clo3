<p>With volumes thirteen through fifteen we can review progress since the first appeared in <date when="1970">1970</date>. When work began the aim was to publish in chronological order and in full all the letters of Thomas and Jane Carlyle to be found; and this is now done to the end of <date when="1842">1842</date>. There is still a long way to look ahead; but a point in time has been reached well beyond Froude&#x02019;s halfway mark in his four-volume biography of Thomas Carlyle, and we have so far given 1,978 of Thomas&#x02019;s letters, 347 of Jane Carlyle&#x02019;s, and a few others directly about them, and with this period we have consulted, listed, and quoted from more than 1,080 surviving letters to them.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A recent accession (9086) to the NLS remains to be fully assessed; it adds many further letters connected with TC written <hi rend="italic">to</hi> or <hi rend="italic">by</hi> other members of the family.</note> The present edition is clearly indebted to previous editors of their letters, without whose work many of them might have been lost; but it is also very far from being simply a rearrangement and reprinting of what is already available in a scattered form. In spite of the attention both Thomas and Jane have attracted, many, if not most, of their letters have not been printed before, others have been given incompletely, and still more are to be found only in newspapers, periodicals, biographies, catalogues, and other works difficult to consult. With the present set of volumes it appears that more than originally expected have not been published before. In addition, not only are they now given as fully and correctly as possible, but they are more exactly dated and explained than before; and events, correspondents, and figures of the Carlyle circle are better accounted for.</p>
<p>To some degree this has already been shown in headnotes to the letters which indicate their previous history. Over the whole fifteen volumes, 33.85% of all letters by Thomas and Jane have not been published before, and another 23.95% have previously been printed only in part. Of the remainder, 29.45% have been published in various collected volumes, and 11.95% have been printed but uncollected, while a few others (about .8%) of which there are no surviving texts are now systematically recorded for the first time.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The headnotes classify the letters as (i) hitherto unpublished, (ii) previously given incomplete or merely quoted from, (iii) in collected volumes of their letters; (iv) in other books or publications, and (v) merely recorded, usually in booksellers&#x02019; and auction catalogues. The least definite category is the second, which may mean that nearly everything, or almost nothing, of any particular letter has already been published, but a high proportion of their texts is new. In volumes 1&#x02013;12 there were 1,836 letters (TC 1,545, JWC 256, others 35); in volumes 13&#x02013;15, 525 letters (TC 433, JWC 91, others 1).</note> This means, therefore <pb id="pg-13-x" n="13:x"/>that though the general account provided by the letters may seem vaguely familiar, well over a half will be new to any reader.</p>
<p>In the present three volumes the proportion of new letters is much more marked. The penny post and the Carlyles&#x02019; changing reputations meant that they wrote more short letters, more of which were kept. In the current set more than half of Thomas&#x02019;s letters have not been published before (50&#x02013;75%), or nearly half (49%) of those of both Thomas and Jane. If to these are added those that have been printed only partly before (Thomas 16%, Thomas and Jane 20%), then as many as 70% have not been previously published in full. In other words, the current volumes may or may not be thought to show us the familiar figures of the Carlyles, but their texts are new, and the picture a fresh one. In addition, though a reader might gather together with some difficulty the letters that have appeared in collected volumes, those from other sources are by no means easily available.</p>
<p>Much else is new both in text and notes. Where appropriate some of Thomas and Jane&#x02019;s other papers have been appended or recorded which extend the record: these have included previously unpublished passages and information from Carlyle&#x02019;s Journal (of which Froude made dramatic use) to which we have not called attention before. In the present volumes, for example, we have also begun to draw on dated personal memoranda from Carlyle&#x02019;s drafts made while he was preparing to write on Cromwell, and, in volume 12, there were his informative notes on his reading before composing the first of the lectures on <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the memoranda see, for example, <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410928-TC-JAC-01"><sic>13:266</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1841-09-28">28 Sept. 1841</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411009-TC-JAC-01"><sic>272</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1841-10-09">9 Oct.</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411019-TC-AC-01"><sic>283</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1841-10-19">19 Oct.</date></corr></ref>; for TC&#x02019;s reading northern literature, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400206-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:32&#x02013;35</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-06">6 Feb. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> Letters <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the Carlyles have been quoted sparingly, especially if already printed in such editions as those of Joseph Slater of the correspondence with Emerson, or Francis Mineka&#x02019;s letters of John Stuart Mill; but the way in which the Carlyles&#x02019; papers were preserved has given a new and unmatched opportunity to verify and explain what their own letters were about.</p>
<p>Jane Carlyle&#x02019;s part now increases, and to some readers she may seem of greater interest. Before the period of the present volumes relatively few of her letters survived; from this point her own brilliant contribution will be seen as increasingly balancing Carlyle&#x02019;s. No woman writer in English (unless Virginia Woolf) has written better <pb id="pg-13-xi" n="13:xi"/>letters or more extensively. Until now she has been published in various selections, starting with the letters collected and annotated by Carlyle himself (<date when="1866">1866</date>&#x02013;<date when="1873">73</date>) from which Froude selected for the substantial three-volume <hi rend="italic">Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle, Prepared for Publication by Thomas Carlyle, edited by James Anthony Froude</hi> (<date when="1883">1883</date>).<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The manuscript was about half as long again as the published version. It was an astonishing tribute, in a sense their joint work, and a longer one than anything undertaken by TC other than his six-volume <hi rend="italic">Frederick The Great</hi>.</note></p>
<p>In our own editing no comments (apart from redating) are passed on predecessors&#x02019; mistakes: it can be profitless, and tolerance is desirable. Yet previous publications have often been faulty. Froude&#x02019;s editing, for example, shows mistakes shared by others, and they have the special importance that his vigor and intelligence have largely preempted how Carlyle is seen. In particular, the text of hundreds of letters given in his biography of Carlyle pretends to be exact but often gives a misleadingly dependable impression. For example, his ellipses seem to show where omissions have been made, but these are highly unreliable. Carlyle&#x02019;s Scottish words are turned to English, either intentionally or through misreading. While silent omissions may have been made to avoid repetition, others are deliberate alterations. No doubt it was carelessness that made him quote from one of Carlyle&#x02019;s letters as if the passage came from his Journal (see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421221-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1842-12-21">21 Dec. 1842</date></ref>), or that he ran two letters together without indication, as with <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420326-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-03-26">26</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420327-TC-JWC-01"><date when="1842-03-27">27 March 1842</date></ref>. Such objections may be dismissed as mere technicalities, like the countless small inaccuracies which do not &#x0201C;conform to modern standards.&#x0201D; But the chief problem lies in the fact that this excuse and his practice disguise the general coloring and bias of his biography, and even lead us to forget that this was in many ways inevitable. In particular, as we read the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> we are often given a generalized account of the Carlyles, contracted into a close circle, with their individuality suppressed&#x02014;all from someone who proclaimed that he wrote the truth with &#x0201C;no reserve.&#x0201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Examples are given only from the present volumes, <date when="1841">1841</date>&#x02013;<date when="1842">42</date>. Froude irregularly omits ellipses and adds them where they should have been left out. Where TC writes &#x0201C;scind&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-13/lt-18410218-TC-MAC-01"><sic>13:39</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1831-02-18">18 Feb. 1831</date></corr></ref>, meaning &#x0201C;servered&#x0201D;) and &#x0201C;trows&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-13/lt-18410820-TC-JAC-01"><sic>13:220</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1841-08-20">20 Aug. 1841</date></corr></ref>, a way of fishing), Froude has anglicized them, which is innocent enough but part of the normalizing tendency. Silent omissions are common, as, for example, in JWC to John Sterling (<ref target="volume-13/lt-18410429-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>13:121&#x02013;22</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1841-04-29">29 April 1841</date></corr></ref>), which cuts a comment about Emerson&#x02019;s new <hi rend="italic">Essays:</hi> &#x0201C;I find him getting affected, stilted, mystical, and in short &#x02018;a considerable of a bore&#x02019; A bad imitation of Carlyle&#x02019;s most Carlylish translations of Goethes most Goetheish passages!&#x0201D; This is from <hi rend="italic">Letters and Memorials</hi> of <date when="1883">1883</date>, the year after Emerson&#x02019;s death; perhaps understandably censored but now restored after a century. JWC&#x02019;s haphazard spelling and punctuation are regularized (even TC had tidied them), small endearments are missed out, and TC&#x02019;s concern for others is restricted or omitted. Altogether this considerably changes both writers. The most frequently read collection of TC&#x02019;s letters (i.e., Froude&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>), in spite of its virtues, is probably the most misleading. Froude&#x02019;s urgent stress on having &#x0201C;no reserve&#x0201D; is in the introduction to the third volume of his biography (<date when="1884">1884</date>).</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-xii" n="13:xii"/>In the main this can be illustrated only by multiple minor instances. But, to take a single example, in <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410728-TC-JAC-01">Carlyle&#x02019;s letter to his brother John, of <date when="1841-07-28">28 July 1841</date></ref>, written on holiday from the shores of the Solway, he speaks in delight about bathing &#x0201C;in sheer nakedness,&#x0201D; wearing only his brother&#x02019;s old shoes, which is silently expunged; numerous members of the family are reduced to just &#x0201C;Alick, Mary &#x00026;c&#x0201D;; their gifts of welcome, which Carlyle lovingly details and could &#x0201C;weep over,&#x0201D; are accepted dry-eyed and smothered under a conventional phrase; and the whole passage is rewritten in commonplace generalities but as if straight from Carlyle&#x02019;s pen. Yet Froude (3:218) piously preserves the contrasting solemnities about &#x0201C;the multitudinous everlasting moan of the Frith of the <hi rend="italic">Selgovae</hi>,&#x0201D; and references to &#x0201C;Plinius,&#x0201D; changed to Pliny. There may be nothing in such a single instance for indignant reprobation; but it is part of a persistent, if possibly unintentional, dehumanizing of the Carlyles. For the present it can be said only that it may exemplify a general tendency in Carlylean studies: an inclination to shirk the specific and write about him in terms of a Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckhian ideal, which, continued long enough, always collapses into the shocking realization that both the Carlyles were mockingly, self-consciously, sensitively, and deplorably human. Nothing is less Carlylean (either with regard to Jane or Thomas) than to rearrange them in a prophetic, pretentious, superior stance. All this might deserve a separate study, for Froude&#x02019;s editorial practice and its result are unsatisfactory just because he aims to appear so smoothly authentic. Other editors, at times, have similar limitations, but fewer pretensions.</p>
<p>Yet whether some of the letters have been unpublished and others known inaccurately is not just a question of how far they let us judge their authors fairly. The Carlyles are central to their age, a touchstone of what was Victorian, certainly a primary source of a period that is often generalized about. The value of a completer edition of their letters also lies in the remarkable insight they give into what was meant by the period and the people who belong to it. Carlyle himself writes to Emerson, <date when="1842-08-29">29 August 1842</date>: &#x0201C;Well, I do believe &#x02026; a man has no right to say to his own generation, turning quite away from it, &#x02018;Be damned!&#x02019;&#x0201D; He does the reverse, and both he and Jane give what he praised, <date when="1842-12-29">29 December 1842</date>, in his friend Varnhagen von <pb id="lastpage-13-xiii" n="13:xiii"/>Ense, a chance to see &#x0201C;what passes in God&#x02019;s universe. &#x02026; A Historical Picture of the living Present Time.&#x0201D; What we mean by <hi rend="italic">Victorian</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Carlylean</hi>, in general or detail, should depend on what we can really know, not what we can most conveniently select. Letters in general have been losing their status as literature or even part of the biographical record, perhaps because though highly expressive their context makes them resistant to reinterpretation. Their value may lie in that very combination.</p>

<p><salute>My Dear Mother,&#x02014;</salute>I designed to begin the New Year with writing a Letter to you; but I was interrupted yesterday: Jack came to me yesterday, he and several other interruptions, so that I <supplied>[am]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brackets in pbd. source.</note> driven upon to-day, and much hurried still, as I usually am. Perhaps Jack himself may be writing to you at this very time: we were to meet again to-day at his inn up in town, when I go out for walking&#x02014;which must be in an hour or so now. He had come in with his Patient and his Patient&#x02019;s Aunt,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x02019;s brother John A. Carlyle (<date when="1801">1801</date>&#x02013;<date when="1879">79</date>) was physician to William Ogilby; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400101-TC-JCA-01"><sic>12:4</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1840-01-01">1 Jan. 1840</date></corr></ref>. The aunt was Mary Scott. They had been in the Isle of Wight.</note> seemingly upon a mere excursion of amusement: he looks well and cheerful; tho&#x02019; he is still in daily doubt as to <hi rend="italic">continuing</hi> in his situation; and indeed speaks as if it were possible that in these very days he might get some intelligence which would lead him to give it up very soon. He has much correspondence with the many parties interested in his Patient&#x02019;s sanity or insanity; for great estates of money and land would be taken from the poor man, and put into other people&#x02019;s possession, if he were once proved to be mad; hence endless jealousies one of the other, anxieties, surmises, &#x00026;c., &#x00026;c.; add to all which that several of the persons concerned seem to be naturally <foreign><hi rend="italic">gomerils</hi></foreign> [fools], and even noisy <hi rend="italic"><foreign>gomerils</foreign>;</hi> so that there is confused folly enough, and oftentimes much ado about nothing. Jack appears to <pb id="pg-13-4" n="13:4"/>manage all very handsomely, and rather to <hi rend="italic">amuse</hi> himself with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">gomeril</hi></foreign> part of the correspondence than otherwise: happily the people who alone have any <hi rend="italic">power</hi> are people of sense, with whom he has nothing but satisfaction. Besides, he seems not to care a <foreign>doit</foreign> about giving up the place at an hour&#x02019;s warning any time; this is an immense point in his favour. He tells the fools on all occasions that if they don&#x02019;t <hi rend="italic">hold in</hi> their ineptitudes a little, he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be off, and leave <hi rend="italic">them</hi> to rid their troubles. He expects, I think, very soon, to get several matters <hi rend="italic">straightened</hi>, and so the matter to go on more smoothly for time coming. I think it quite an uncertainty whether he may not continue in it yet a long time, or cut it short very soon. Such uncertainty would be, perhaps, more unpleasant to any of us than it is to him&#x02014;in his own present uncertain humour, unable to fix on any plan for himself if he were free of this engagement. He has plenty of <hi rend="italic">travelling</hi>, sees all kinds of places, reads a little, has nothing to <hi rend="italic">overburden</hi> his mind; and gains the royallest wages&#x02014;as much as all the rest of us do, put into a lot! Whenever it becomes pressing upon him to settle and sit down, he can do it with a good supply behind him now. Poor fellow, I am sorry he is not settled, notwithstanding; there is little real profit for a man rolling about in that fashion; but one cannot help him, save with silent wishes: I have undertaken not to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> with him, again about that subject: all speech is useless or worse.&#x02014; All these things observe, dear mother, are <hi rend="italic">secrets;</hi> not to pass beyond your own walls: I should be finely rated if Jack got any wind of them coming round to him again!</p>
<p>Jean sent me a Letter last week with news that poor Jenny had got handsomely through her work.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x02019;s sister Jean Carlyle Aitken (<date when="1810">1810</date>&#x02013;<date when="1888">88</date>), m. to James Aitken; they lived in Dumfries. On <date when="1840-12-24">24 Dec. 1840</date> Janet (Jenny) Carlyle Hanning (<date when="1813">1813</date>&#x02013;<date when="1898">98</date>), TC&#x02019;s youngest sister, had given birth to her second child, Mary, who was to m. a Holden.</note> Yesterday Alick confirms that; adding also that mother and daughter continue to do well. I am right glad to know it; I mean to send poor Jenny a &#x0201C;scrape of a pen&#x0201D; before long.&#x02014; What Alick says about Mary Harkness, her dumb surprise, then her silent purchase of cotton sheets and clothes, is deeply affecting to me.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x02019;s brother Alexander Carlyle (<date when="1797">1797</date>&#x02013;<date when="1876">1876</date>), who ran a shop in Ecclefechan. TC had sent a sovereign to his cousin Mary (Carlyle) Harkness (d. <date when="1847">1847</date>); see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401216-TC-AC-01"><sic>12:364</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1840-12-16">16 Dec. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> Alas, the hardship, hunger, and misery of thousands on thousands in this world is frightful. Jane here has been looking out a little into one case that came before her; the emblem of a whole world of others: a woman with famishing, naked children, husband out of work; frost, <pb id="pg-13-5" n="13:5"/>despair, starvation: Jane got something done for the poor body, who seemed capable of help, willing to work and struggle; all seemed to be going fair, when the unfortunate wretch was discovered to have <hi rend="italic">stolen</hi> a miserable hat-brush from the lobby here! It would be worth to her at the Pawnshop about ninepence. The unfortunate who want only food can be supplied; but they that have lost their honesty, alas, are beyond <hi rend="italic">man&#x02019;s</hi> help! One&#x02019;s heart is sore to think of all this.</p>
<p>Our frost, however, is over now; it has ended in a beautiful thaw, and to-day the sun is shining out of clear skies. It will be better for us all. Jane has got out again: she declared she was threatening to &#x0201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">stock</hi></foreign> [become stiff and numb],&#x0201D; as the horses for want of exercise do!&#x02014; You never told me anything about your cold: not a word! <hi rend="italic">Has</hi> it in reality left you? I again and again recommend all manner of care and caution. I hope you will get no harm on this <hi rend="italic">Sacrament</hi> occasion;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Communion was celebrated twice yearly, with services beginning on Thurs., communion on Sacrament Sun., and finishing on Mon.</note>&#x02014;if all go right, perhaps you will get this Letter on the Monday, and Alick and Jenny will make you a good cup of tea, while you read me, before taking the moor again! Jemmy had a Letter from me;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x02019;s brother James Carlyle (<date when="1807">1807</date>&#x02013;<date when="1890">90</date>), who farmed Scotsbrig; the letter was of <date when="1840-12-09">9 Dec. 1840</date>.</note> but he makes no kind of response,&#x02014;the lazy fellow.</p>
<p>You may tell Alick there is some sort of confusion about that Ecclefn. Library; but that now I see how to clear it again. Having once <hi rend="italic">got</hi> their copy of the Book they ordered, it is of course irrevocable, no Bookseller can be asked to take it back. Had I known this, it had been all straight. But not hearing anything at all, on Fraser&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">day</hi> having finally arrived last Tuesday, I was obliged to proceed: I addressed a copy of the Miscellanies to James Aitken at Dumfries, with an inscription on it for the Ecclefechan Library, and there it will probably be lying while you read this!&#x02014; Well, I will write to James <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to send forward the Book; we will get the inscription <hi rend="italic">changed</hi> (that will not be difficult), and make a present of it to W. Grahame.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham (<date when="1770">1770</date>&#x02013;ca. <date when="1857">1857</date>), who farmed Burnswark, 3 mi.

Pray let me have this, some of you, without delay: you, dear mother, if no other will. One word is easily written; and a penny will carry it!</p>
<p>Good be with you all, my ever dear mother, my dear kind friends one and all. Here new &#x0201C;interruptions,&#x0201D; on foot and in coach! Jane shall receive them, not I. There is no end to tumult here. I struggle to work <pb id="pg-13-6" n="13:6"/>in spite of it; threatening sometimes to <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> it, and kick it to <hi rend="italic">pieces</hi>. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear mother.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Letter, which had been long looked for, and was welcome when it arrived. I shall have to write at greater length before long; but today, in the extremity of haste, I send merely a word on something of the nature of <hi rend="italic">business</hi>. This is it. A Parcel, sent by Fraser,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Fraser (d. <date when="1841">1841</date>), TC&#x02019;s publisher.</note> to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, will arrive shortly addressed to James by Coach; perhaps is already arriving.

This is the whole business so far as relates to the <hi rend="italic">Siller Gun</hi>. But now beside this there will lie a larger Parcel with the address &#x0201C;Ecclefechan&#x0201D; on it: this, all wrapt up as for instant despatch, I hereby authorize him to <hi rend="italic">open</hi>,&#x02014;and indeed to <hi rend="italic">keep by him</hi> till he get farther instruction.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your prompt Letter; I shall impatiently expect another tomorrow to hear how it goes with poor Jenny. She ought to take great care of the cold: I will hope, it is nothing else for the present, and that the danger of it for this time may be over. Poor little thing, she is very weak, and of an irritable constitution at any rate.&#x02014; Our Mother happily is well again;&#x02014;unless she too get mischief by this job.</p>
<p>I have settled about the Book of <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies;</hi> and will today send word to Aitken about having it <hi rend="italic">prepared</hi> (a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> inscription cunningly put upon it), and sent to Grahame.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham.</note> It were of course as well if nothing were <hi rend="italic">said</hi> about this till Grahame see it. I have got a new <hi rend="italic">yellow leaf</hi> from Fraser;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For an inscription to replace the original one at the front.</note> and the Bookbinder at Dumfries must do the rest.&#x02014; I begin now to decide upon actually printing my volume of <hi rend="italic">Lectures:</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">On Heroes, Hero-Worship, &#x00026; the Heroic in History</hi>, hereafter <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi>.</note> the poor Ecclefechan people will stand fair for a copy. It does seem <pb id="pg-13-9" n="13:9"/>very strange what <hi rend="italic">they</hi> can get to read in these things. Fraser offers me &#xa3;75 <hi rend="italic">in hand</hi> for this volume (the munificent man!)&#x02014; I fancy I had better take it than go out among the gross asses that deal in the Book-trade, and have my soul vexed: it is not for <hi rend="italic">money</hi> that I have ever made a good job of writing; and at present, thank Heaven, I do not fail for want of money. Often it strikes me as if I had no need of more money; as if money could really do no more <hi rend="italic">good</hi> to me at all: having clothes to wear and a house and food convenient in it, is one not a <hi rend="italic">free</hi> man, freer than most Dukes &#x00026; Kings are?</p>
<p>Jane has not forgotten you; but is sore confined and stagnated by the continuous cold. She has not been out above once these three weeks. She does not <hi rend="italic">cough</hi> yet, but always hovers too near it. Our beautiful thaw went off again: Sunday brought a sharp Northwest wind; a hard frost next day; then snows &#x00026;c; and today we have the streets all <hi rend="italic">glass</hi>, a detestable <hi rend="italic">frost-fog</hi> which bites you to the bone; and the sun after looking out for an hour, like a great red warmingpan unable to <hi rend="italic">act</hi>, has taken his leave! I pray you all put on thick clothing; and especially keep my Mother in from such weather.</p>
<p>Jack is still here; amusing himself largely; his Patient well pleased with London, giving little trouble; and all going well. I meet him every day. Nay <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, at this moment are the Patient and he, come hither in a thing they call a <hi rend="italic">Cab</hi> (cabriolet, or one horse chaise)!&#x02014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign> till they go.&#x02014;</p>
<p>Ogilvie the Patient is off into the City; Jack prefers remaining to walk with me. So I must end.</p>
<p>Let me hear good news from you tomorrow, dear Alick; and be a good <foreign>bairn</foreign> yourself.</p>

<salute>My dear Susan</salute>
<p>I always thought you a woman of admirable good sense; and I rejoice to see that marriage has not spoiled you. This speaks well for your Husband too; for I defy any woman unless she be no better than a stone, to hinder herself from taking something of the colour of the man she lives beside all days of the year. We women are naturally so <pb id="pg-13-10" n="13:10"/>impressible, so immitative! the more shame to men if we have all the failings they charge us with! Our very self-will, I believe which they make such a fuss about, is after all only a reflex of their own!</p>
<p>I find in your letter no less than three several proofs of this &#x0201C;admirable good sense&#x0201D;&#x02014;first you love <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the same as ever&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is highly sensible in you&#x02014;secondly you improve in admiration of my Husbands writings; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> also is highly sensible&#x02014;thirdly you understand that my silence means nothing but&#x02014;that I am silent; and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> (to use my Mothers favourite phrase) is sensible &#x0201C;to a degree.&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; Grace Welsh (<date when="1782">1782</date>&#x02013;<date when="1842">1842</date>).</note> Indeed if my silence is indicative of any thing at all dear Susan, it indicates more trust in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> steady sentiments of kindness towards me, than I have in the generality of peoples who profess to love me best&#x02014;if I thought that you imagined me forgetful when I am only not making periodical affirmations of my remembrance of you, and that you were to cast me out of your remembrance in consequence, I would write certainly, would conquer my growing repugnance to letter-writing, rather than risk the loss of your affection&#x02014;but I should not feel so grateful to you as now, with the assurance I have that I may give way to my indolence and keep your affection nevertheless.</p>
<p>In fact in my character of <hi rend="italic">Lion&#x02019;s</hi> wife here I have writing enough to <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, by constraint, for disgusting even a Duchess of Orleans<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Which Duchess of Orleans is not traced, but see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370304-JWC-JWE-01"><sic>9:159</sic><corr>JWC to JWE, <date when="1837-03-04">4 March 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> Applications from young Ladies for autographs, <hi rend="italic">passionate</hi> invitations to dine, announcements of inexpressible longings to drink tea with me&#x02014;all that sort of thing which as a provincial girl I should have regarded perhaps as high promotion, but which at this time of day I regard as very silly and tiresome work, fritters away my time in fractionary writing, against the grain, and leaves me neither sense nor spirit for writing the letters which would suggest themselves in course of nature. Dear Susan I am sorry to say this world looks always the more absurd to me the longer I live in it! Human beings always the more like sheep! But thank heaven I am not the shepherd set over them: so let them go their way, while we who are a little higher than the sheep go ours! Now dont be fancying that I am growing into a &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">proud Pharisee</hi>,&#x0201D; which were even a degree worse than a sheep! Not at all! I have a bad nervous system keeping me in a state of greater or less physical suffering all days of my life, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the most infallible specific against the sin of spiritual pride that I happen to know of.</p>
<p>I am better this winter however than I have been for the last <hi rend="italic">four</hi> winters&#x02014;only the confinement&#x02014;for I never get across the threshold in <pb id="pg-13-11" n="13:11"/>frost&#x02014;is rather irksome, and increases my liability to headach&#x02014;but it is a great improvement to have no cough and to be able to keep in the perpendicular.</p>
<p>For my Husband he is as usual, never healthy, never absolutely ill&#x02014;protesting against &#x0201C;things in general&#x0201D; with the old emphasis&#x02014;with an increased vehemence just at present, being in the agonies of getting underway with another book. He has had it in his head for a good while to write a life of Cromwell and has been sitting for months back in a mess of great dingy folios, the very look of which is like to give me lock-jaw.</p>

<salute>Dear Murray,</salute>
<p>Yesterday, after some delays at Sea as I suppose, your Book-parcel arrived; a most welcome advent; for which many thanks. I will be <pb id="pg-13-14" n="13:14"/>careful of your <hi rend="italic">Baillie;</hi> I expect great good from the Book; it threatened otherwise to prove unattainable here. The Bannatyne people, I perceive, are reprinting it; if they would make a cheap edition for sale, the favour were still greater.</p>
<p>Already I have read your <hi rend="italic">Rutherford:</hi> a really meritorious work in its department; full of accurate extensive research, presented in the most lucid manner. I have read it with real satisfaction. The <hi rend="italic">Miss Craig</hi> too, whoever she is or was, that did that Bushy-Bield,&#x02014;thank her for me! The ancient peat-<foreign>reeky</foreign> mansion, with its door-porch, its <foreign><hi rend="italic">louping-on stane</hi></foreign> [mounting-stone], its weathered windowless walls, sheltered under the scraggy Hill,&#x02014;it is an authentic piece of poor old Scotland, infinitely touching to one here!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Life of Samuel Rutherford</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1828">1828</date>). Its frontispiece is entitled &#x0201C;Bushy-Bield, The Residence of Rutherford, while Minister of Anworth,&#x0201D; and signed &#x0201C;Miss Craig,&#x0201D; who is otherwise unidentified.</note></p>
<p>Have you among your Books, <hi rend="italic">Scots Presbyterian Eloquence, Magapico, Naphtali?</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jacob Curate (pseud. of Gilbert Crokatt and John Monroe), <hi rend="italic">The Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence; or, the Foolishness of their teaching discovered from their books, sermons, and prayers</hi> (<date when="1692">1692</date>); Magi Magapica (pseud.), <hi rend="italic">The British and American liturgy: being a new form, proposed and adapted to the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland and the thirteen United States of America</hi> (<date when="1783">1783</date>); James Stewart and James Stirling, <hi rend="italic">Naphtali; or, the Wrestlings of the Church of Scotland for the Kingdom of Christ</hi> (Edinburgh? <date when="1667">1667</date>).</note> The latter I have never seen, and perhaps can hope almost nothing from; the two former I have seen, and could by some <hi rend="italic">very</hi> convenient opportunity look at again. But indeed I have not yet tried <hi rend="italic">here</hi> whether they are attainable. Pray take no trouble about them, in the mean while&#x02014;</p>
<p>If your Mr Simpson still persist in his candidateship,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunter Simpson, candidate for the librarianship of the London Library; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401218-TC-TM-01"><sic>12:368</sic><corr>TC to TM, <date when="1840-12-18">18 Dec. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> would it not be well to have certain of his Testimonials printed; a copy distributed to each of the Committee &#x00026;c? I am not sure but he has a better chance now than formerly; Cochrane seems very likely to withdraw. Had Mr Simpson been a London man, the odds might have lain in his favour at present. If he can get anybody to testify that he has an expertness for <hi rend="italic">business</hi>, skill in <hi rend="italic">buying</hi> books, getting them bound &#x00026;c &#x00026;c&#x02014;it might serve him considerably.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you judge it wiser not to speak with Mr S. at all about this, or involve him farther in expence with such chance of disappointment? I cannot say that this were <hi rend="italic">un</hi>wise.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Good b&#x02019;ye, dear Murray. My pen is of the worst; my haste great.</salute></closer></p>

<p>Thanks for your offer of the old Sermons.

<salute>Dear Lord Lyttelton,</salute>
<p>I wish you were here yourself, as we hope you soon will be, to assist us in choosing a Librarian! Candidates multiply: two fresh ones were here today; Cochrane himself, it seems, has hardly altogether given up yet.</p>
<p>Your <foreign>Protegee</foreign> Washbourne I have seen: he seems an intelligent, vivacious, cheerful-hearted, serviceable-looking man;&#x02014;unluckily perhaps with more skill in Biblio<hi rend="italic">poly</hi> than Bibliography: but we are to remember that the meed is not laurel crowns and the Bank of England, but hard work and &#xa3;150 a-year; Perfection is a thing we must not look for! I am not sure but, in defect of Cochrane, this Mr Washbourne is likely in very truth to be the suitablest of all for us. Pray come yourself, and look.</p>

<salute>Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Thanks again for your Letter: who knows but you will grow an altogether punctual copious Correspondent by and by! We hope poor Jenny is now out of danger; we shall count on <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for writing if there is anything more that creates anxiety. Be a good Boy and look to it.</p>
<p>What I want of you today is to get that Bit of Paper changed at Postie&#x02019;s into a gold half-sovereign, and give it to Jenny at Kirtlebridge<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where the Hannings lived, ca. 3 mi. ESE of Ecclefechan.</note> along with the note. One can now <hi rend="italic">send</hi> money for three-pence! You have to take the thing to the Post-Office, and sign your name to it.&#x02014; Gold rather than shillings: that will be handsomer!</p>
<p>I enclose you Jack&#x02019;s last Note; which you need not <hi rend="italic">publish</hi> any farther <pb id="pg-13-18" n="13:18"/>than you see useful; perhaps not farther than <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>.&#x02014; He is well; and tumbles along amid his coil of <foreign><hi rend="italic">fasheries</hi></foreign> [troubles] with considerable cheerfulness. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Fashery</hi></foreign>, I think indeed, is most of the work he has to do; and gets about as good as &#xa3;1,300 a-year for doing!&#x02014; My printing is not yet started; I <foreign><hi rend="italic">scunner</hi></foreign> [flinch] somewhat at it: I can get for four months close labour the handsome sum of &#xa3;75! On the whole if a man have bread to eat, why should he complain?</p>
<p>That is a sore tragedy which I read last night in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, of John Bell, his Wife, Mother and Aunt Jean; all known to me, all dead, probably in great misery!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1841-01-11">11 Jan.</date>, reported that John Bell and his wife, his mother Janet, b. Carruthers, and his aunt Jean Carruthers had d. of the fever in Ecclefechan in the space of seven days. They left eight children.</note> I came upon it late at night, sitting quite alone amid my own reflexions.&#x02014; The weather appears to be even worse with you than here.</p>
<p>A wretched mortal that was wont to leap from top masts, bridges &#x00026;c, and dive and do feats of that kind, perished in a shocking manner (as you will see by that Newspaper) here this week. One of his tricks was to <hi rend="italic">act</hi> hanging; the noose slipt; he was found hanged in earnest! When I think of the mob looking at him, brutal animals, the still more brutal &#x02018;gentlemen&#x02019; of the Bridge Committee encouraging such a scene,&#x02014;few things I have ever heard of seem more detestable.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Gilbert Scott, age 27, d. on <date when="1841-01-11">11 Jan.</date> as TC explains (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1841-01-12">12</date>&#x02013;<date when="1841-01-13">13 Jan.</date>).

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Jenny</hi>,&#x02014;</salute> We have heard very frequently from Alick of late about you, for which punctuality we are greatly obliged to him. You have had a bad turn, poor little Jenny, and we were all anxious enough to hear from day to day, as you may believe, how it went with you. Alick reports of late, yesterday in particular, that you are now considered out of danger, steadily getting better. We will hope and believe it so, till we hear otherwise. You must take good care of yourself. This weather is good for no creature, and must be worst of all for one in your situation. Do not venture from the fire at all, till the horrible slush of snow be off the ground.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-19" n="13:19"/>And what becomes of our good Mother all this time? She could not be at rest of course if she were not beside you, watching over you herself. Alick struggles to report favourably of her, but we have our own apprehensions. What can I do but again and again urge her to take all possible precautions about herself (which however she will not do!) and trust that she may escape without serious mischief. If you were once up again I will fancy <hi rend="italic">you</hi> taking care of her. It must be a great comfort to have you so near her&#x02014;within walking distance in the good season.</p>
<p>We have never had here so ugly a winter: first violent frost, snow &#x00026;c., then still nastier times of the thawing sort; for a week past there has been nothing but sleet, rime and slobber, the streets half an inch deep with slush and yet a cake of slippery ice lying below that; so in spite of daily and hourly sweeping and scraping, they constantly continue. I, with some few others, go daily out, whatever wind blow. I am covered to the throat in warm wool of various textures and can get into heat in spite of fate. Jane too holds out wonderfully, ventures forth when there is a bright blink once in a week; sits quiet as a mouse when the winds are piping abroad. We understand you are far deeper in snow than we. I believe there is now a good thick quilt of it lying over the entire surface of the Island.</p>
<p>The Doctor was here till Tuesday morning. We saw him daily with much speech and satisfaction. A letter yesterday announced that they were fairly settled in Wight again. He looked as well as need be.</p>
<p>I have sent by Alick a bit half-sovereign to buy the poor new <foreign>bairn</foreign> a new <foreign>pock</foreign>. You must take it without grumbling. Tell my dear Mother that she <hi rend="italic">must</hi> take care of herself, that I will write to her before many days go. Better health to us all. Our kind wishes to Robert.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hanning (d. <date when="1878">1878</date>), Jenny&#x02019;s husband.</note> Good be with you every one.</p>

<salute>Dear Christie,&#x02014;</salute>
<p>I rejoice to find you still busy,&#x02014;visible or invisible.</p>
<p>Were it not for the frightful four miles of mud and frost-fog, I would gladly be with you tomorrow night: but really it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> frightful; <pb id="pg-13-20" n="13:20"/>almost equal I think to swimming of the Hellespont in that <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi> climate of Leander&#x02019;s!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Greek legend Leander regularly swam at night across the Hellespont from Abydos to Sestos to meet his beloved Hero.

<p>But do you want me at the Library Office tomorrow by daylight! We will say 3 o&#x02019;clock, and decide on punctuality. Or if you do not like tomorrow, call it Friday, and warn me.</p>
<p>Cochrane, two days ago, apprises me that he is still a candidate; that he is rapidly printing Testimonials &#x00026;c.

<p>Washbourne seemed to me a sensible, goodtempered, active, useful-looking man.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Having a minute of time, I will write you half a line today; merely to keep you in peace about us! You did hear very lately, I believe; for Alick and Jenny both had bits of Notes from me: but I know you have a great appetite for Letters, and can never hear too much!</p>
<p>Jenny&#x02019;s own Letter arrived, I think, on the same day with one from Jamie. I was glad enough to see poor Jenny&#x02019;s hand, after the late fighting she has had. Jamie&#x02019;s account of himself is also very interesting to us. Poor Tom&#x02019;s leg does seem to be getting better.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James&#x02019;s son Thomas (<date when="1838">1838</date>&#x02013;<date when="1841">41</date>). Sickly from birth, he also seemed to have a paralysed leg; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400229-TC-MAC-01"><sic>12:65</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1840-02-29">29 Feb. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> It must have been <pb id="pg-13-21" n="13:21"/>a singular bout that of Jamie&#x02019;s reading the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution!</hi> His observations on it were solid Annandale observations, well worthy of the paper they took up, and altogether entertaining to us. We heard somewhere that the <hi rend="italic">Murrain</hi> had been among his cattle: but he does not mention it, wherefore we hope there was nothing serious in that.</p>
<p>My chief anxiety now is about you, my good Mother; for loss of sleep, anxiety and fatigue during Jenny&#x02019;s distress cannot but have hurt you more or less. Yet you would have been <hi rend="italic">un</hi>easier at home! It is simply a misfortune, for which there was no help. What you can do now, dear Mother, is to take double care of yourself; especially while this wild winter lasts. It is the severest season I remember since <date when="1819">1819</date>&#x02013;<date when="1820">20</date>; it must be dismal for many a poor unsheltered, unprovided creature.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A storm had struck most of the country, <date when="1841-01-03">3 Jan.</date>, with much snow, gales and flooding, resulting in widespread distress; see <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1841-01-03">3</date>, <date when="1841-01-17">17</date> and <date when="1841-01-26">26 Jan.</date>, and <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1841-01-11">11 Jan.</date></note></p>
<p>We had thaw since I wrote; plenty of soft wind (which you too had it) on Saturday night; our snow and frost all gone, and nothing but mud on the morrow. Some three days of warm <hi rend="italic">mud</hi>, such a <hi rend="italic">de</hi>gree of <hi rend="italic">mud</hi> as London alone knows; and now we have Northwest wind and once again frost!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Copeland (111&#x02013;12) gives this description by TC from an undated fragment: &#x0201C;Our weather is grown decidedly good for the last three days; very brisk, clear and dry. Before that it was as bad as weather at any time need be: long continued plunges of wet, then clammy <foreign>glarry</foreign> days on days of <hi rend="italic">half</hi> wet (in a kind of weather peculiar to London, and fully uglier than the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> wet):&#x02014;a world of black sunless <foreign>pluister</foreign> [muddle], very unpleasant to move about in! The incessant travel makes everything mud here, in spite of all that <foreign>clats</foreign> [scrapers] and besoms can do; a kind of mud, too, which is as fine as paint, and actually almost sticks like a kind of paint! I took, at last, into the country, with old clothes and trousers folded up; there the mud was <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> mud, and far less of it, indeed, <hi rend="italic">little</hi> of it in comparison with other country. We dry again in a single day of brisk wind.&#x0201D;</note> First it blew, as the American said, then it <hi rend="italic">snew</hi>, then it <hi rend="italic">friz</hi>, then it <hi rend="italic">thew</hi>, and then it <hi rend="italic">friz</hi> again!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390204-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:18</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-02-04">4 Feb. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Jane stays in the House almost close, except when a gleam of warmth comes. She certainly holds out much better this season than in several past ones. She bustles about the house, when not out, and dresses warm.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; I have had two bits of Notes from Jack out of the Isle:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Wight.</note> he was in good sound health, I thought, while here, and seemed to get along wonderfully well. Little petty confusions from day to day, the wise quenching of these: this seems to be the main work he has. A kind of hope that he is doing his patient good withal prevents him from entirely wearying of it.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-22" n="13:22"/>I am on a kind of bargain with Fraser about the printing of my Lectures:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi>.</note> but the dog will not come up to my terms, I doubt. We shall see soon now. I have been, and am still, reading much; very stupid stuff mostly! I keep a close mouth; will <hi rend="italic">see</hi> what comes of it.</p>
<p>Now, dear Mother, if you like to send me the <hi rend="italic">scrape of a pen!</hi>&#x02014; Yet do not plague yourself; I will force myself to believe nothing ill, till I do hear. Keep in the house, till the weather mend!&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; I saw a paragraph about Mr Tait your minister in the last <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It reported, <date when="1841-01-11">11 Jan.</date>, that William Tait of the Secession Church had been given a clock by the women of the congregation because of his &#x0201C;kindness of heart, urbanity of manner and faithful attention to his public duties.&#x0201D;</note>&#x02014; <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You must allow me to thank you very cordially for this little Book;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The South Sea Islanders: a Christian Tale. Moraig; or, the Seeker for God: a Poem</hi> (<date when="1841">1841</date>).</note> which I have just read, with a pleasure rare to me in such cases. The Drama is of the wildest, spurning at Dramatic canons, Probability, or even if you will, Possibility; the Poem too is naked enough:&#x02014;yet in both the one and the other, spite of every objection, there lies a singular fascination for me. The very verses I have read with true pleasure, true love; and if you knew the aversion, amounting almost to a kind of <hi rend="italic">sacred horror</hi> which I usually feel against the soul-confusing insolent jingling emptiness of most modern &#x0201C;Poetry&#x0201D; (which in general I decline altogether to look at), you would understand how much this means in my case!</p>
<p>But there is a fascination, as I say;&#x02014;a fascination of which I see the origin well enough. A genuine, simple, manful soul looks thro&#x02019; these words. It is long since I have seen such a piece of right <hi rend="italic">Scotchmanhood;</hi> a pure gleam of what yet survives of best among us; very beautiful;&#x02014;like the right &#x0201C;silver-gleam,&#x0201D; that glances in the eye of the <pb id="pg-13-23" n="13:23"/>refiner; betokening that, amid all scums and drosses, there is genuine metal in the crucible!&#x02014;</p>
<p>What can I wish you more; except that you would go on writing to our good people, as you find audience and occasion, in that same spirit, on <hi rend="italic">all manner of subjects;</hi> not on Temperance alone,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is presumably referring to Dunlop&#x02019;s other recent works, <hi rend="italic">The Philosophy of Drinking Usage</hi> (<date when="1839">1839</date>), and <hi rend="italic">The Temperance Emigrants; a Drama</hi> (<date when="1840">1840</date>), as advertised at the back of <hi rend="italic">The South Sea Islanders</hi>.</note> but on a thousand other things: Heaven knows they need greatly to be written to, and spoken to; and have, in these days, few or none to do it.&#x02014; Something like ten Dramas, of the kind they call &#x0201C;legitimate Dramas,&#x0201D; &#x0201C;classical Dramas,&#x0201D; have been sent to me this year: yours, with all its faults, is, as it were the only one of them that did not deserve to be instantly flung into the fire. A word is a word; precious, and means a thing: but a babblement which means no-thing&#x02014;?&#x02014;</p>
<p>In great haste I scribble you this line of thanks, of rough-spoken hearty acknowledgement.</p>
<p>We have lost your address; I must, if better be not, address to your Bookseller. We hope to see you again at Chelsea before long.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday came your Little Note, very welcome to us; in the evening came the <hi rend="italic">outermost</hi> of these two from our Mother. I send it, and the preceding one. There was also a most flowing acknowledgement from W. Grahame of the receipt of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>. I cannot find it at this moment: there was no news; a good hope of the Consulship but no additional certainty.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham hoped to be appointed American consul at Glasgow; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401031-TC-WG-01"><sic>12:309&#x02013;10</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1840-10-31">31 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>In the course of last week I bargained with Fraser for my Lecture-Book. &#xa3;75 the dog would give no more; but he also gives a &#xa3;75 for a thousand <hi rend="italic">Sartors</hi>, the edition of that being run out too: so we go on printing <hi rend="italic">both</hi>, with all imaginable velocity; and I am to have &#xa3;150 for the two.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> and the 2d edn. of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>.</note> We must be content. &#x0201C;4 sheets of each, 8 of both&#x0201D; are to come to me every week <foreign><hi rend="italic">credat Judaeus!</hi></foreign><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201C;<foreign>Credat Judaeus Apella</foreign> [Apella the Jew may believe this]&#x0201D; (Horace, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> 1.5.100).</note> I am very busy <hi rend="italic">revising</hi> the Lectures; am now thro&#x02019; the First. I design to make few changes. In five or six weeks I may fairly expect the quit of the concern;&#x02014;free for another.</p>
<p>We rejoice to hear of your coming back. Such neighbourhood to us is one of the best features of your place. By degrees you will be able to decide what can be done. As you say, it will probably be all of your own deciding. Nobody else seems capable of getting such <hi rend="italic">insight</hi> as will suffice for a decision. Meanwhile every day you continue, simply without explosion, is well paid for in money: that is already a point decided.</p>
<p>We are bothered here not a little with choosing of &#x0201C;London Librarians&#x0201D;! Old Cochrane, I hope will be the man. I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> stand to till he or some fit man be got.</p>

<salute>Dear Brother</salute>
<p>It is difficult for me to give you an advice in reference to this of Hanning.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Hanning was now a shopkeeper in Kirtlebridge. His scheme is explained in a letter from John Carlyle to James of Scotsbrig, <date when="1841-01-28">28 Jan.</date>, in which he said that &#x0201C;two days ago&#x0201D; he had heard from Hanning and his wife (their sister Jenny) that Hanning wanted to buy oatmeal while it was cheap in order to sell later at a profit. John followed TC&#x02019;s advice in asking James to enquire into the matter, with a view to the possibility of an immediate loan of &#xa3;50 (see also <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410206-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1841-02-06">6 Feb.</date></ref>). John wrote to James again, <date when="1841-02-08">8 Feb.</date>, saying that he had agreed to the loan, providing that he was repaid in <date when="1841-10">Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;I have got the impression that Robert has a tendency to expand himself beyond his means &#x00026; undertake new things without calculation. &#x02026; He has always seemed to talk in a loose, vivid way about business; but he is active, diligent &#x00026; sober &#x00026; may easily prove &#x02026; that the impression his conversation has given me is erroneous. &#x02026; Enough of this transaction!&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> I certainly consider it questionable to give him so much headway; it would be foolish, for himself and for yourself, to do it without more certainty of insight than there is yet. Perhaps your best way would be to ask Jamie about it; send his Rob&#x02019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201C;Rob&#x02019;s&#x0201D; is written above &#x0201C;his.&#x0201D;</note> Letter on to Scotsbrig and ask, what prospect really <hi rend="italic">is</hi> there? It would be hard to prevent poor Rob from doing a good turn to himself, when you could so easily forward him. But; on the other hand, you remember the black-whiskered Hash that came here inquiring for &#x0201C;Mr &#x02019;Anning!&#x0201D;&#x02014; Tell Jamie to answer you decisively, in a practical manner; then ask Rob to get you some <hi rend="italic">security</hi>,&#x02014;by way of evidence to you that his scheme is practicable. Perhaps you might bid him get Jamie of Scotsbrig to be your security; and say, if Jamie will stand good, you will consider it right evidence. Jamie will not burden himself with such a risk, unless he see his way thro&#x02019; it; and he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> see, whether there is a way or no way.&#x02014; On the whole I think perhaps the plan would be to write to Jamie (as above), and write to Rob also; and let them make it out between them. Let Rob understand that you must have <pb id="pg-13-27" n="13:27"/>a written <hi rend="italic">bill</hi>, and all things in order; that you mean to be strict, and to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> repaid at the date.&#x02014; Moreover perhaps &#xa3;50 would be enough at first, for one year; till you see how it prospers?&#x02014; I have no more light upon it. Hanning is not well known to me, never transparent to me as yet, and his trade at present is of course wholly unknown.&#x02014;</p>
<p>Today I have finished my revisal of <hi rend="italic">Mahomet:</hi> very poor stuff I am in a terrible fright too about certain leaves of the end of <hi rend="italic">Odin</hi>, which I thought to have found here; but which I <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> are at the Printer&#x02019;s! I must go and see. No Proofsheet as yet.</p>
<p>Alas I know not <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I shall begin to write <hi rend="italic">Cromwell!</hi> Perhaps never. <hi rend="italic">Here</hi>, with my present nerves, it is like sitting in the hollow of the great Bell of St Paul&#x02019;s: one can write nothing.</p>
<p>It is fine Spring weather. Jane is gone out; so must I. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>: let me hear again soon.</salute></closer></p>

<p>I called, the other day, partly for the purpose of urging your benevolent diligence about Cochrane and the Librarianship.

<salute>My dear good Mother,</salute>
<p>Take <hi rend="italic">half</hi> a word from me today, since I have no time for more! I had forgotten that it was Saturday, till after breakfast I learnt it. And ever since, there has been business on business!&#x02014;</p>
<p>We received your good little Letter, one evening, and sent it on to John. Thanks to you for it. I had a Letter too from Grahame about his <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies;</hi> for which he seems amazingly thankful, poor fellow. We will not tell him about the Ecclefechan Library: let well be!</p>
<p>John also sends word of himself: all right enough: a probability that he will be here again before long.</p>
<p>Jane and I are well; rejoicing in the improved weather. Not the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> of weather yet; but immensely better than it was: some days have been sunny and bright, a pleasant prophecy of spring.</p>
<p>I have <hi rend="italic">bargained</hi> with Fraser for my <hi rend="italic">Lectures;</hi> they are now at press; that keeps me so very busy. He would give me only &#xa3;75, the dog; but then he undertakes a new edition of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> too (the former being sold) and gives me another &#xa3;75 for that too. It is not so bad; &#xa3;150 of ready money,&#x02014;at least money without risk. I did not calculate on getting anything at <hi rend="italic">present</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi>. You see we are rather rising than falling: &#x0201C;mall in shaft&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning &#x0201C;keeping things going&#x0201D;; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18290305-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:9</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1829-03-05">5 March 1829</date></corr></ref>. &#x0201C;Teufelsdrockh&#x0201D; in the following sentence is without the umlaut in the MS.</note> at any rate; that is always a great point. Poor Teufelsdrockh, it seems very curious that money should lie even in him! They trampled him into the gutter at his first appearance; but he rises up again, finds money bid for him.</p>
<p>On the whole I expect not to be obliged to <hi rend="italic">lecture</hi> this year; which will be an immense relief to me. I shall not be so broken in pieces; I shall have strength for perhaps some better thing than lecturing.</p>
<p>You spoke of going to Dumfries.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the birth of Jean Carlyle Aitken&#x02019;s son, <date when="1841-02-06">6 Feb.</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410206-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1841-02-06">6 Feb.</date></ref></note> I am always afraid of your getting hurt on those expeditions: but I suppose you will not be able to rest without going. I wish Jean and you both were thro&#x02019; it!</p>
<p>By the bye, did I ever sufficiently tell Isabella<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Carlyle, b. Calvert (d. <date when="1859">1859</date>), James&#x02019;s wife. Margaret Carlyle lived with them at Scotsbrig.</note> that her Butter continues excellent, none better. I owe Jamie a Letter, too. Alick ought to have been apprised, how good his bacon was,&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">was</hi>, for alas I myself <pb id="pg-13-29" n="13:29"/>eat the most part of it, and it is done. Some weeks ago his Tobacco ran out: I never told this either;&#x02014;I forget everything!</p>
<p>Well, dear Mother, here is all I can say in my hurry! I will write again soon. But with <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Books at the Printer, with &#x00026;c, &#x00026;c, what can a poor man do? Be good <foreign>Bairns</foreign> one and all of you!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday you had as brief a Line as might be. Today also you must be satisfied with very little.</p>
<p>I have been terribly taken up with various things. First, with electing a Librarian. Cochrane, not without very considerable industry on our side of the house, has carried it. I judged his appointment to be an important matter; the final signal for my washing my hands of it,&#x02014;leaving it in his, as in <hi rend="italic">good</hi> hands. Cochrane comes to take possession on the <date when="1841-02-17">17<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>. At the earliest possible day there will then be a General Meeting summoned (probably, alas, not till after Ladyday<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="--03-25">25 March</date>. At the meeting of <date when="1841-02-03">3 Feb.</date>, Cochrane, proposed by TC, seconded by Craik, was chosen by nine votes to eight in preference to Hayes, proposed by Prof. Henry Malden (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400410-TCEMF-LLS-01"><sic>12:101</sic><corr>TCEMF to LLS, <date when="1840-04-10">10 April 1840</date></corr></ref>), seconded by Christie.</note> when we get a house); I then formally resign my shadow of Secretaryship, and withdraw, to let the whole matter sink or swim. No good can be done without <hi rend="italic">somebody&#x02019;s</hi> taking trouble; I am one of the somebodies on this occasion: I must not grudge.</p>
<p>Secondly, Proofsheets have much occupied me. We are now far into the second Lecture: the First needed very heavy correction; paragraphs to be added &#x00026;c: twice I sat a whole day; sometimes like the <hi rend="italic">cooking of a cucumber</hi>, after getting something all ready with great labour, I flung it out of window, as the best course! We are thro&#x02019; all that now, in tolerable fashion. I find these Lectures not so bad a thing. Nothing new in them for <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> but much like to be new enough for many others. Puseyism,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Also Tractarianism, Anglo-Catholicism, and the Oxford Movement, &#x0201C;Puseyism&#x0201D; called after Edward Bouverie Pusey (<date when="1800">1800</date>&#x02013;<date when="1882">82</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22910"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400926-TC-RWE-01"><sic>12:268</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1840-09-26">26 Sept. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> many other <hi rend="italic">Isms</hi> that have hailed me Brother, will find now that I am fatal to them, or they to me. Be it so. I am here only to speak; nor have I been in any hot haste to speak.&#x02014; This morning I wrote for <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Perfect-Copies of every sheet: one for you, one for America. You will probably get three or four together. <hi rend="italic">Take care of them;</hi> that you may bind them up, and make <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Presentation <pb id="pg-13-30" n="13:30"/>Copy of them! Fraser the dog allows me only a dozen in all; and many people, with some right, expect copies from me.</p>
<p>Besides all this, <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdk</hi> goes on, and with great rapidity. Him I print according to the printed copy, and correct only with pencil, a <hi rend="italic">comma</hi> or so in the page.&#x02014; Nay Saunders and Otley, the Blockheads, threaten to get into a kind of controversy, as if <hi rend="italic">they</hi> had some shadow of right to this Second Edition too!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Publishers of the first British edn., <date when="1838">1838</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380612-TC-MAC-01"><sic>10:96</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1838-06-12">12 June 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> One Letter I wrote them about a week ago, full of the choicest politeness (in fact I had, unintentionally, neglected a piece of good manners to them): today there comes a new Note from them still harping on the old thing; this I have just answered with brevity, not without pungency. The Absurdities Incarnate!</p>
<p>You see how I am situated! Last night I went to Milman&#x02019;s,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Hart Milman (<date when="1791">1791</date>&#x02013;<date when="1868">1868</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18778"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), at this time rector of St. Margaret&#x02019;s, Westminster; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400303-TC-HHM-01"><sic>12:69</sic><corr>TC to HHM, <date when="1840-03-03">3 March 1840</date></corr></ref>. His letter of invitation was dated <date when="1841-01-27">27 Jan.</date></note> to his antique sumptuosities in the Cloisters of Westminster. It was the <hi rend="italic">price</hi> he demanded for voting in Cochrane&#x02019;s favour!

The dinner expanded itself, in due time, into a <foreign>Soiree</foreign>; highdressed women beautiful and not, sitting circularly on a huge round Ottoman, back to back, by way of centre; miscellaneous flood of male stagers, old and young, flowing all round. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ut mos est</hi></foreign> [As the custom is].<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Juvenal, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> 6.392.</note> Not interesting to me. I left it at 11 o&#x02019;clock, while they were still arriving.</p>
<p>Till this horrid frost abate at any rate, there can be no thought of travelling! Were the Sun out again I should really like to see the country for a day or two.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>What in world is becoming of you in these dreadfully tempestuous days? It is the fiercest weather I ever remember since <date when="1819">1819</date> in Edinburgh. Frost everywhere, hard as iron, water will freeze in few minutes within any room that has no fire; and a storm of East wind blowing all day and night! The like of me, that can buckle myself up, and <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> with large rapid strides, flourishing my stick,&#x02014;does well enough: but those who cannot take exercise! Every morning I think of you; the clear lighted fire is so grateful to me; and I think how <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have to get out of bed, and light the fire for yourself! It will never do, dear Mother. We must get you some young &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">help</hi>,&#x0201D; as the Americans call it. It must be done,&#x02014;as good soon as <foreign><hi rend="italic">syne</hi></foreign> [late]. The &#x0201C;<foreign>fash</foreign> [bother]&#x0201D; of these people, indeed, is hateful to one. I do wish, however, you would think of that, or of some equivalent to that. We will bear the expense of it,&#x02014;I myself would bear the expense of it, and think it a great blessing to do so,&#x02014;if you could arrange it otherwise. Think of it maturely. It is a shame for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to rise to a clear fire, and my good Mother who toiled so long for me obliged to rise and <hi rend="italic">light</hi> her fire!&#x02014;&#x02014;</p>
<p>Jane stays in the house, close. She does wonderfully for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, far better than of late years. Many poor wretches are terribly ill off. Begging <pb id="pg-13-32" n="13:32"/>in the streets; half-naked, dolefully &#x0201C;singing&#x0201D; &#x00026;c. In the Cotton Countries,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Industrial Lancashire.</note> I suppose they are still worse situated.&#x02014; People&#x02019;s minds do begin to be opened to the necessity, the pressing perilous necessity of getting something done for the innumerable miserable labouring clan. But it is far off yet, that of getting anything effectual done. Heaven send it <hi rend="italic">be</hi> done <hi rend="italic">in time;</hi> before violence and conflagration arise!</p>
<p>This morning there came a little Note from John. He is well, and speaks of lending Hanning some money.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1841-02-01">1 Feb.</date> John Carlyle said that he meant to lend &#xa3;50 &#x0201C;in the first instance,&#x0201D; to Robert Hanning; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410127-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1841-01-27">27 Jan.</date></ref></note> Their &#x0201C;travels,&#x0201D; if they meant any travelling, are all suspended by this weather. They ask me to come down, and see <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, were the frost once done.</p>
<p>My Proofsheets keep me in a perpetual whirl of swift occupation. Two Books going on at once, and the Printers using all speed! But already we are almost as good as half done. By the end of this month I expect we shall have it entirely off our hands. I send you some leaves of the beginning of the <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi>. I find it will be a rather curious Book. Likely to give great offence; perhaps to do some considerable. I find more worth in it, now that it comes to be printed, than I thought there was. We shall see.</p>
<p>What is Jean doing? <hi rend="italic">You</hi> cannot go to Dumfries in such weather. Impossible!&#x02014; She will perhaps put it off, a little? Poor Jean, I should like well to hear from her again that all was well.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Carlyle Aitken has written in pencil on the MS here, &#x0201C;Yes all was well. This very night Another Tom sees the light JCA,&#x0201D; referring to the birth of her son Thomas.</note></p>
<p>But now, good Mother, I must be off. Alas, I feel as if in <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi> about your fire, I had <hi rend="italic">got</hi> it actually <hi rend="italic">lighted</hi> for you! It is not so. I wish I knew what to do to make it so.</p>
<p>My affections and excuses to Jamie, to Isabella and little Tom. Alick, I think, is to write to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. He performed admirably during Jenny&#x02019;s illness. <closer><salute>Good be with you all always! Your Affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Christie,</salute>
<p>I have read the Pamphlet,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">An Explanation of the Scheme of the London Library in a Letter to the Earl of Clarendon</hi>, pref. dated <date when="1841-02-15">15 Feb.</date> It explained the object of the Library committee as to establish &#x0201C;a large, general, comprehensive&#x0201D; lending library; and argued that continental cities possessed such libraries as did Manchester, Edinburgh, etc., but that London did not have one &#x0201C;capable of satisfying the intellectual wants of its inhabitants.&#x0201D; It was its aim to supply &#x0201C;good books in all departments of knowledge,&#x0201D; and with 5,000 subscribers and an annual income of &#xa3;10,000 London might then &#x0201C;raise its head &#x02026; from its present deficiency and disgrace&#x0201D;; summarized by Harrison 89&#x02013;93.</note> and find it, except one or two errors of the press, all well. The only point now is that we could get all the world to read it, and lay it to heart! For the present I have no hold of any Review; and indeed not a moment&#x02019;s time if I had. By and by, we shall see.</p>
<p>Your augury that Cochrane will be an inert Librarian is far from mine.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christie had voted for Hayes rather than Cochrane.</note> I know the man, for one thing, to be a most assiduous diligent man; and his whole faculty and ambition are now directed on this object. I think it will be a great pity if we do not, as I prophesy we shall, allow him to conciliate us all; and start fairly with what of resources the Enterprise has.</p>
<p>Brittan did look very pettish when I proposed the new fortnight <pb id="pg-13-34" n="13:34"/>to him. I had to fling the reins on his neck, and say &#x0201C;He might go then,&#x0201D; before he would agree to sit still on the old terms. He complained of nothing specific, but seemed in a general bad humor. I suppose him to be unhappy, poor fellow, not without reason. It is of no use quarreling with him now; let him depart, as peaceably as may be, and give him your blessing.</p>
<p>Cochrane undertakes to be in the office &#x0201C;on the <date when="1841-02-17">17th</date> at 10 in the morning.&#x0201D; Could you, who have the whole threads of the business in your hand, give him <hi rend="italic">hold</hi>, in some way, of the work he has to do. The rest will gradually arrange itself, were a beginning once made.</p>
<p>We shall have to get our joint Secretaryship laid handsomely down in some way,&#x02014;I suppose in presence of some General Meeting. It is what I want, and long for, no less than you. The burden has been almost altogether yours; but the hypocritical semblance of a burden, this, with many pitiful <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>, weighs heavy too on me. We shall then be Non-Secretaries! The London Library will have the breath of life in it; may grow as it can. Your promptitude, your swift diligence, energy and dexterity will always be a memorable thing to me.</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Jewsbury,</salute>
<p>Your good Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1841-01-23">23 Jan.</date></note> would have got a readier answer, had I not been unusually busy. Some ten days ago I was for answering it; but the Letter itself at that moment, huddled hastily aside and locked up somewhere, in my shifting out of one room into another,&#x02014;was not discoverable. I am up to the chin in papers and flying fragments;&#x02014;here nevertheless lies yours once more!&#x02014; I am printing two Books; an old one, and a new. Nay I have had to sit almost half a week, till the life was almost choked out of me, in the Babel element of Westminster Hall; deciding a Jury-case some of your Manchester people sent me, about patent India-rubber cards!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410212-TC-HMS-01">TC to HMS, <date when="1841-02-12">12 Feb.</date></ref></note>&#x02014; In short, there is no limit to my confusion. But I have shoved the welter aside, a little, today; and will have a few words of speech with my brave Geraldine. In some week or two, this hurly-burly, what of it is peculiar, will have rolled itself off altogether, into a decent completion.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-35" n="13:35"/>Curiously enough what you say about <hi rend="italic">Fate</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201C;Do not you think that the secret of the strength of those old Heroes, who had as it were the <hi rend="italic">rough hewing</hi> of the World, &#x00026; whose steadfastness of purpose makes one even now regard them as <hi rend="italic">Gods</hi>, lay in the firm conviction that <hi rend="italic">Fate</hi>, was above all &#x00026; not to be avoided by any effort; so that they were free to give their whole energy to their work without any wavering of hope or fear.&#x02014; I think the doctrine of <hi rend="italic">Prayer</hi> being of no avail to alter the dispensations of Providence has a tendency to enervate one&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Will</hi> for if we once begin to believe it, we are disturbed by hope, &#x00026; our actions are uncertain.&#x0201D;</note> arrived here precisely while I was correcting a Proofsheet in which something to the very same effect stood printed! <hi rend="italic">Prayer</hi>, in the mere sense of asking something that is pleasant or deprecating what is painful, seems to me, as it does to you, a mistaken thing. Our modern convictions, if we will look honestly at them, are in fact hardly consistent with it. Yet there is more in <hi rend="italic">Prayer</hi>, as the Christian people meant it, than that. Something which we too cannot dispense with, get it in what <hi rend="italic">shape</hi> we may! The prostrating of our own will before the Highest; agreeing fervently to take <hi rend="italic">his</hi> will, however cruel-looking, and not ours, for the best, for the blessedest: that is, I think, the highest morality there is in man.</p>
<p>You will find hints and glimpses about all that, in these <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi> of mine, the Book I am printing. I expect a very confused response to the many strange things set forth there,&#x02014;strange and new, as I found, to the world, but not new to me for ten years past: it was because of their turning out to seem so new, that I decided on printing them. From here and there a true hearted Geraldine, intent on hearing a true word rather than a plausible one, I discern well enough that the response will not be confused! The number of souls who, in these Islands, are weary of being walking &#x0201C;Formulas,&#x0201D; and intent at all costs on being &#x0201C;Realities,&#x0201D; is, thank God for it, rapidly increasing of late years.&#x02014; The other Book is your old friend <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, which they are reprinting. It is strange, and other than joyful for most part, to look back upon your <hi rend="italic">Self</hi> of ten years ago! Good part of this Book I find to be true; but it all lies at a distance from one&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Here</hi>,&#x02014;so visible, so inaccessible, in the &#x02018;transparent prison&#x02019; of the Past!&#x02014;</p>
<p>You ask yourself, too vivid Geraldine, &#x0201C;Is <hi rend="italic">this</hi> all I am here for?&#x0201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had written: &#x0201C;to <hi rend="italic">live</hi> is no trifle&#x02014;and one has a wearing sense of responsibility without knowing too well how to fulfill it&#x02014;it seems as if with <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> before us we had the power to do much, yet we always seem as if we were either wasting it utterly, or spreading it on things of no worth &#x02026;&#x02014; Even those things generally called the <hi rend="italic">business</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> &#x00026; the <hi rend="italic">duties</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, are in <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi> of too little value to <hi rend="italic">fill up</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>.&#x02026; Still one cannot help standing sometimes to ask, is <hi rend="italic">this</hi> all for <hi rend="italic">wh</hi>. we were sent here?&#x0201D;</note>&#x02014; Alas yes, we have all to ask that, in our struggling moods, and answer it very mournfully: &#x0201C;Yes, <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, paltry insignificancy of a <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, is all!&#x0201D; At <pb id="pg-13-36" n="13:36"/>bottom, our very asking of it is a part of the answer. It is a struggle of the incompressible infinite Soul to enlarge that same &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">This</hi>,&#x0201D; to ennoble it, and make it (whether the Newspapers mention it or not) a great &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">This</hi>.&#x0201D; For the rest, the question itself, the remonstrance in the question, is one of the many that have no answer. If we consider it well, the immensest thing man does (writing <hi rend="italic">Iliads</hi>, founding religions, governing empires) is small, most small;&#x02014;one day, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> will have vanished, the Earth herself will have vanished, and not be! Small, I say, as good as non-extant (on one side); and yet the meanest thing a man faithfully does is great withal, great as the world.&#x02014; Our <hi rend="italic">purpose</hi>, dear Friend? Our best purpose, so far as I could articulate it, is to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> what God made us capable of being and doing. To each one of <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, it is literally an infinite purpose; wide as our own <hi rend="italic">Selves</hi>, deep as the mystery of our Life. The working of it out; that is the problem for us; a problem of wise calculation and detail from day to day. Mark moreover, The instinct of general resolute <hi rend="italic">tendency</hi> towards this, continual wish and effort towards it: that alone is what can be demanded of us; nay I think that alone has much wisdom or value in it. Your acquaintance who wanted to make himself &#x0201C;a name&#x0201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had spoken of a man she knew &#x0201C;who has more steadfastness of purpose than any other I ever met with, &#x00026; I looked on him with wonder, till he spoiled all by telling me, that he had lived <hi rend="italic">one</hi> idea from boyhood, w<hi rend="italic">h</hi>. had carried him thro&#x02019; all difficulties &#x00026; discouragement &#x00026; that was to make himself a <hi rend="italic">name</hi>&#x02014;&#x00026; go down to posterity:&#x02014;all he was doing was merely a <hi rend="italic">means</hi> to that end. now if it were not worth doing for its <hi rend="italic">own sake</hi> how could the accident of renown make it worth spending a life on? Will you &#x02026; tell me something more about the purpose we <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to have?&#x0201D;</note> would have seemed to me as entirely poor a man as he did to you. We are not expected to have a signal-post set up for ourselves as the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of our career: no signal-post on this intricate low, complex, <hi rend="italic">convex</hi> Earth we live in;&#x02014;none but a kind of fanatic or fool, I think, has such very commonly. The wise man, as I say, has his pole-<hi rend="italic">star</hi> up aloft, instead of signal-post down below. He says to himself I will travel northward,&#x02014;northward, not southward, by God&#x02019;s help,&#x02014;towards that everlasting loadstar: but my windings on the labyrinthic Earth, with its mountain-precipices, with its seas, and impassable torrents,&#x02014;Heaven alone knows at what signal-post, goal or restingplace I shall arrive on <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, or with how many circuits and searchings by the way!&#x02014; Do I give you any idea? I know partly what I myself mean.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. TC on ambition in <hi rend="italic">Heroes, Works</hi> 5:222&#x02013;23.</note></p>
<p>In Your letter is one passage which I interpret to mean that the most important of all practical questions for a young woman has come before you for decision. Dear Geraldine, lonely young heroine, may a good Genius guide your judgement! It is in our arrangement of things, <pb id="pg-13-37" n="13:37"/>and indeed must more or less in all arrangements be, a questionable thing for a woman (somewhat more than for a man) not to wed at all. And yet to wed<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is reading between the lines as Jewsbury is not specific but says: &#x0201C;I know not how to answer what you say about having a purpose &#x00026; following it out&#x02014; the point toward w<hi rend="italic">h</hi>. for many years, all <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hopes &#x00026; wishes tended, was last week in a modified form placed most unexpectedly within my grasp&#x02014;I long thought I had become reconciled to doing without it&#x02014;&#x00026; when I come to look on the matter with fresh eyes, it seems of very questionable value, yet I have been much unsettled by the occurrence &#x00026; the chances are, that I shall do an unwise thing, possibly a <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> one, to secure it, only because it <hi rend="italic">once</hi> seemed so much to be desired.&#x0201D;</note> when the <hi rend="italic">infinitude</hi> of Hope and Affection is all awry<supplied>[?]</supplied>!&#x02014; On the whole, I find it all a dubiety, a confused lottery: one of the few fixed precepts I would quote for myself is, &#x0201C;Have nothing to do with a <hi rend="italic">fool!</hi>&#x0201D; Between the wise, some wise relation will in the worst case spring up; but a <hi rend="italic">fool</hi>,&#x02014;he is the most fatal fellow always! <closer><salute>God bless you, dear Geraldine, and guide you well!&#x02014; Yours&#x02014;</salute></closer></p>

<p>No Letters from you: I hope nevertheless nothing is wrong. Here are the two next sheets; they came late last night. I have corrected into the beginning of the Fifth Lecture now; that is the length we are got. The <hi rend="italic">Pressman</hi> follows always at a few days distance.</p>

<p>Before going out I will write you a line; merely to say we are well. I am kept in a perpetual <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kippitch</hi></foreign> [confusion] with the Printers at present.

<p><pb id="pg-13-39" n="13:39"/>When I wrote last in answer to poor Alick&#x02019;s mournful message, I had been summoned again, under unheard-of penalties, to attend a Jury-trial about &#x0201C;Patent India-rubber cotton-cards&#x0201D;! Two people from Manchester had a controversy, whose was the invention of said cards. It had cost them perhaps ten thousand pounds, this controversy or lawsuit. There were 150 witnesses summoned, from all parts of England and Scotland. It had been left unfinished last term, that was the reason of the &#x0201C;unheard-of penalties&#x0201D; for us Jurymen&#x02014;that they might not be obliged to begin at the very beginning again. The same Twelve Men did all assemble. We sat for two endless days, till dark night each day: about 8 o&#x02019;clock at night on the second day, we imagined it was done, and we had only to speak our verdict;&#x02014;but lo and behold, one of the Jury stood out, we were eleven for the Plaintiff, and <hi rend="italic">one</hi> the other way who would not yield! The Judge told us we must withdraw. Thro passages, stairs up and down; into a little stone cell with twelve old chairs in it, one candle, and no meat, drink or fire! Conceive our humour,&#x02014;not a particle of dinner, nerves worn out &#x00026;c &#x00026;c. The refractory man, a thickset flathead <hi rend="italic">sack</hi>, erected himself in his chair; said, &#x0201C;I am one of the firmest-minded men in England. I know this room pretty well; I have starved out three juries here already!&#x0201D;&#x02014; Reasoning, demonstration was of no use at all: they began to suspect he had been <hi rend="italic">bribed;</hi> he looked really at one time as if he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> keep us till half past nine of the morning, and then get us dismissed <hi rend="italic">without</hi> any verdict at all,&#x02014;the whole trial to begin again! One really could not help laughing; tho&#x02019; one had a notion to <hi rend="italic">kill</hi> the <foreign>hash</foreign> [oaf]! &#x0201C;Do not argue with him,&#x0201D; I said; &#x0201C;flatter him: don&#x02019;t you see he has the obstinacy of a boar, and little more sense in that head of his than in a swedish turnip!&#x0201D; It was a head all cheeks, jaws, and no brow; of shape, somewhat like a great ball of putty dropped from a height. I set to work upon him, we all set to work; and in about an hour after our &#x0201C;withdrawal,&#x0201D;&#x02014;the <foreign>hash</foreign> (I pulling him by the arm) was got <foreign>scind</foreign> [severed] from his chair,&#x02014;one of the gladdest moments I have seen for a month; and then, in few instants more, we were all rejoicing on the road home! In my life I have seen nothing more absurd. I reflected, however, that really <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had perhaps contributed to get justice done to some poor unknown Manchester man; that had I not been there, it was very possible they would have quarrelled with this &#x0201C;firmest-minded man in England,&#x0201D; and cost somebody another &#xa3;10,000!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude notes (3:206n.): &#x0201C;As Carlyle told the story to me, the man had settled himself down in a dark corner of the room, there meaning to stay out the night. &#x02026; Carlyle sat down beside him, congratulated him on being a man of decision, able to have an opinion of his own in these weak days, and stand by it, a quality both rare and precious &#x02026; but, &#x00026;c. In fact, did he not see that by standing out he would hurt his own friends? &#x02026; The jury were eleven to one. &#x02026; What chance was there that any future jury would agree to the verdict which he wished? There would only be more expense with no result, &#x00026;c.&#x0201D; The ellipses are in Froude&#x02019;s note.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-40" n="13:40"/>My <hi rend="italic">health</hi> has profited nothing by that business; but I am getting round again, nearly as well as I was. There has been a speculation about my going down to the Isle of Wight; which I really almost think I shall do: I have a great longing to see the green country, or even the <foreign><hi rend="italic">blae</hi></foreign> [dark-bluish] country, the everlasting sea; and the weather is getting to have bright blinks in it now.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; Jack as you will see there, writes me this morning one of the shortest of all letters, that perhaps <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are coming hither. We must wait till that decide itself. Perhaps I had better wait at any rate till my Books be done.</p>
<p>Next door to us, a certain poor Dr Marshall&#x02019;s Wife has died, in a very mournful way; and Jane is much occupied, these two days, doing what she can for the poor people. Mrs Marshall, now departed, was from Edinburgh, a relative of Haddington people well-known to Jane.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Marshall&#x02019;s father, Daniel Wilkie (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x02013;<date when="1838">1838</date>), had been minister at Yester, nr. Haddington, <date when="1821">1821</date>&#x02013;<date when="1829">29</date>, and then minister of New Greyfriars, Edinburgh, <date when="1829">1829</date>&#x02013;<date when="1838">38</date>. He was possibly a brother of James, John, and Nancy Wilkie, all referred to by JWC in vol. 2, the children of James Wilkie Esq., of Rathbyres and Gilchriston, J. P. at Haddington, and grandchildren of Patrick Wilkie, minister of Haddington, <date when="1720">1720</date>&#x02013;<date when="1771">71</date>. For a description of JWC skating with John, as children, see Hansons 14&#x02013;15.</note> She was a hapless woman; never very sound of mind, we thought.</p>
<p>I hope Jean is recovered, or recovering well. Perhaps you are <hi rend="italic">there</hi> just now?&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; Poor Alick! Go and speak a word to him, <hi rend="italic">look</hi> a Mother&#x02019;s look on him, as you have opportunity. It was a sad thing.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick&#x02019;s sadness was probably because of the illness of his son James (b. <date when="1840-07">July 1840</date>), mentioned in <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410321-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1841-03-21">21 March</date></ref>.

<salute>Dear Mrs Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your Husband&#x02019;s Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1841-01-31">31 Jan.</date></note> shall have answer when some moment of leisure is granted me; he will wait till then, and must. But the beautiful <pb id="pg-13-41" n="13:41"/>utterance which you send over to me;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had written to TC, <date when="1841-01-31">31 Jan.</date>, thanking him for the copy of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> he had sent her: &#x0201C;I must no longer be a silent participator in my husband&#x02019;s enjoyment of your friendship now that yet another beautiful gift calls for an expression both of my gratitude for your kind remembrance, and of the deep interest I have&#x02014;these many years, felt, both in your writings and in their Author. / I will not seek to say how much you have done for me&#x02014;my acquaintance with your works began a new era in my life. And I am thankful to the Highest that one man at least&#x02014;sees into the needs of Humanity with an eye made clear by Love. / The hope of seeing you by our fireside has cheered me from year to year. It is now rather a faint hope&#x02014;certainly, but I will trust it shall yet be realized. When a child I used to live over in my dreams the wonders of the Arabian Nights.&#x02014; I think, always, of your actual presence with us&#x02014;here in Concord&#x02014;with the very feeling which possessed me in those childish dreams. / And your Wife&#x02014; in her I have thought I might even find a <hi rend="italic">sisterly</hi> friend. Certainly there are strong points of sympathy between us.&#x02014; Our devout regard to certain literary productions&#x02014;to say nothing of our believing love for their Authors&#x02014;must be no slight bond of union. Tell Mrs Carlyle, with my love&#x02014;that I hope, one of these years if I may not say months&#x02014;will find her beneath our roof-tree&#x02014;an honoured and cherished guest. She must not send you over the ocean alone&#x02014;you will be but half welcome without her. You must make her sure that she will arrive&#x02014;not among strangers&#x02014; but find herself at once in the midst of a circle of friends&#x02014;all interested in her for her Husband&#x02019;s sake, and those who have seen or heard of her for her own. Am I warped by national partiality when I say that here she will be shined upon by a constellation&#x02014;a very little one though it be&#x02014;of true and beautiful souls in whose light we perpetually rejoice, and in which we still look for her star-beam. / I would offer through you, kindest regards to Miss Martineau if you should see her / Will you pardon my signing the unheard-of name by which my husband has presumed to re-baptise me? He will have me known by no other&#x02014;and believes it valid even to Civil Law&#x02014; / Lidian Emerson.&#x0201D;</note> melodious as the voice of flutes, of AEolean Harps borne on the rude wind so <hi rend="italic">far</hi>,&#x02014;this must have answer, some word or growl of answer, be there leisure or none! The Acadia, it seems, is to return from Liverpool the day after tomorrow I shove my paper-whirlpools aside for a little, and grumble in pleased response.</p>
<p>You are an enthusiast; make <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights</hi> out of dull foggy London Days; with your beautiful female imagination, shape burnished copper castles out of London Fog! It is very beautiful of you;&#x02014;nay it is not foolish either, it is wise. I have a guess what of truth there may be in that; and you the fair Alchymist, are you not all the richer and better that you know the <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> gold, and will not have it called pewter or splelter,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably &#x0201C;spelter&#x0201D; misspelled.</note> tho in the shops it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> only such? I honour such Alchymy, and love it; and have myself done something in that kind. Long may the talent abide with you; long may I abide to have it exercised on me!</p>
<p>Except the Annandale Farm where my good Mother still lives, there is no House in all this world which I should be gladder to see <pb id="pg-13-42" n="13:42"/>than the one at Concord. It seems to stand as only over the hill, in the next parish to me, familiar from boyhood. Alas, and wide waste Atlantics roll between; and I cannot walk over of an evening!&#x02014; I never give up the hope of getting thither some time. Were I a little richer, were I a little healthier; were I this and that&#x02014;!&#x02014; One has no Fortunatus&#x02019; &#x0201C;Time-annihilating&#x0201D; or even &#x0201C;Space-annihilating Hat&#x0201D;:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 153.</note> it were a thing worth having in this world.</p>
<p>My Wife unites with me in all kindest acknowledgements: she is getting stronger these last two years; but is still such a <hi rend="italic">sailor</hi> as the Island hardly parallels: had she the <hi rend="italic">Space-annihilating Hat</hi>, she too were soon with you.</p>
<p>Your message shall reach Miss Martineau; my Dame will send it in her first Letter. The good Harriett is not well; but keeps a very courageous heart. She lives by the shore of the beautiful blue Northumbrian Sea; a &#x0201C;many-sounding&#x0201D; solitude which I often envy her.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harriet Martineau (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x02013;<date when="1876">76</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18228"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), ill since <date when="1839">1839</date>; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391208-TC-RWE-01"><sic>11:228</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1839-12-08">8 Dec. 1839</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Above two months ago I was on the point of writing to you, and ought not to have heeded the fallacious whispers of Indolence but actually to have written, That <hi rend="italic">Baillie&#x02019;s Letters</hi> had actually come into my possession. A certain Dr Murray,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Murray.</note> an early acquaintance of mine in Edinburgh, happened to possess the Book; and sent it me for an unlimited time. I have read it; with unusual interest and profit. One wonders that such a Book ever fell into such a state of rarity, of un-procurability. It is scandalously edited too, or rather not edited at all, only printed,&#x02014;and that also in an entirely scandalous manner.&#x02014; The Bannatyne people, I am very glad to find, are getting out a proper reprint of <hi rend="italic">Baillie</hi>, to be accompanied with Notes.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie, A.M., Principal of the University of Glasgow</hi>, ed. David Laing; vols. 1 &#x00026; 2 came out in the autumn.</note> He is a great block-head B., but he carried a pair of eyes in his head; which so few do! I have got <hi rend="italic">Turner</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Turner (<date when="1632">1632</date>&#x02013;<date when="1686">86</date>?), <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of His Own Life and Times</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1829">1829</date>), pbd. by the Bannatyne Club.</note> from Cambridge; I can get a variety of things: but all that has been suspended for some time with Proofsheets and chaotic <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>.</p>
<p>What you say of Dodds<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Dodds (<date when="1813">1813</date>&#x02013;<date when="1874">74</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7747"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400205-TC-JADO-01"><sic>12:30</sic><corr>TC to JADO, <date when="1840-02-05">5 Feb. 1840</date></corr></ref>. Aitken and Dodds did not meet till <date when="1841-03">late March</date> but Dodds had corresponded with him enthusiastically since TC had recommended their meeting; see also <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410300-TC-JADO-01">TC to <sic>JD</sic><corr>JADO</corr>, [<date when="1841-03">mid-March</date>]</ref>.</note> corresponds pretty exactly with all I have been able to learn or surmise about him. The other day he sends me a most tumultuous boisterous explosion of a Letter: good in the heart of it, something almost like <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> in the heart of it; but wild as the woods. Such an Orson<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The wild man; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311220-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:72</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-12-20">20 Dec. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> will take terrible shaving and <foreign>tawing</foreign> [dressing: as of leather]!</p>
<p>On the whole I wish you saw the man, to report about him. A poor <pb id="pg-13-44" n="13:44"/>brother struggling in that same Orson-state, if he be aidable at all, appeals to one. Help is due to the help-needing!&#x02014; I want your report about Dodds as soon as you can.</p>
<p>We are not ill here; glad in some gleams of returning spring. The tumult of London, ever onwards from this season, gets triple and ten-fold; more and more hateful to me, fatal to me! Were the weather once warm, I seriously meditate running off somewhither.</p>
<p>We unite in all kind regards to Mrs. Aitken.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza, b.

<p><salute>Alas dear Mrs Welsh,</salute> it is strange as well as very sad that the only intercourse betwixt us for so many years should be made up of announcements of death and letters of condolence.

<p>Write to me when you <hi rend="italic">can</hi>, and tell me about the other, and yourself, and how this poor boy died&#x02014;</p>
<p>This has been a dismal week with me&#x02014;your intimation of death in my own kindred found me in the midst of death, which did not <pb id="pg-13-45" n="13:45"/>affect me in my personal affections, but has affected me deeply in my sympathies    The wife of a surgeon next door had died after giving birth to a crippled infant and the poor husband has been nearly out of his wits ever since, with no woman about him except myself, not so much as a servant that could be of the smallest use to him&#x02014;his old Mother is upwards of eighty and half insane&#x02014;the poor child has a frightful prospect in life&#x02014;if God spare it&#x02014;for the Father has to go on the expedition to Africa from which he will probably never return.</p>

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>The secret of the Authorship of your <hi rend="italic">Election</hi> shall not be disclosed by either of us. A nominal <foreign>incognito</foreign>, I suppose indeed, is all you aim it; and indeed is all that could be attained now: but as for us we will let it be as real as it can.</p>
<p>This week past I have been living under the frightfullest despotism of Influenza;&#x02014;in bone, muscle, head, heart, soul body and spirit, one of <pb id="pg-13-48" n="13:48"/>the most perfect <hi rend="italic">wrecks</hi> anywhere extant! Neither does the thing seem in any haste to go away: indeed it is the outcome and culmination of a very extensive set of things which I have painfully had my eye upon for a long while.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; You too have been suffering: alas, it is far the saddest fruit of the Fall of Man this of having a sick body to live in! There is no remedy in Art that I can hear of: but Nature herself brings one before long.</p>
<p>I have serious thoughts of getting out of London altogether this season, to witness one other Summer before I die. No words can do justice to the abhorrence I feel of this place sometimes. We shall see.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> and the Hero-<hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi> are both printed, and away from me. With great pleasure I bequeath them both to the Prince of the Power of the Air<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Satan; see Eph. 2:2.</note> to work <hi rend="italic">his</hi> good pleasure with them: it is not probable that he dislikes them much worse than I do,&#x02014;under many points of view. He is a very useful fellow that Prince; he tramps you off the <hi rend="italic">husks</hi>, in his rough way, and then you see whether there was any kernel and what.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Happily here is a Letter from you this morning; we had begun to fear there was something wrong as you did not write.</p>
<p>Today, thank Heaven, I feel decidedly better; it is the third day I have kept the house,&#x02014;sitting even with a <hi rend="italic">Rob-Roy</hi> shawl pinned round my neck:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A large shawl in the Rob Roy tartan; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310911-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:412</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-09-11">11 Sept. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> but my sleep is coming back to me; my <hi rend="italic">influenza</hi> is giving clear sign of departure. There is in my nostrils, for one thing, a strange <hi rend="italic">smell</hi>, what I remember out of very old years as a symptom of the departure of bad colds. I have really had an ugly fit of it this time; perhaps I shall be better than I was now that it is gone.</p>
<p>I spend much of my thought at present in scheming out some possibility of passing this whole season in the country; seeing another summer yet again on the Earth! I make but small progress towards a Practicability as yet: but we shall see. I feel utterly incompetent to undertake any new work of magnitude in Cockneydom at present. Probably the deepest wish of my soul is even that, to get out of Cockneydom forever and a day! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Voyons</hi></foreign> [Let us see].</p>
<p>No Copy of the <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi> or of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> has come hither yet. Jane is up in Town today; and undertakes to inquire about it. I have no pleasure in the thing myself; little wish ever to see it.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Taylor,</salute>
<p>For the last ten days we have been labouring here under a doleful visit of <hi rend="italic">Influenza;</hi> unable to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> anything, not so much as live without doing mischief! It is not usual with me to meddle with these epidemics; but this time it has been my lot. I believe it is perhaps a beneficial crisis: for these many months I have been in a very bad way; and now this, were it once over, may perhaps be the beginning of improvement. Unfortunately, just as I began to recover, my Wife has taken ill. Your Note would have been answered sooner, had it not been for all this.</p>

But <pb id="pg-13-51" n="13:51"/>it is possible for every human soul: it is pity if a gifted human soul should not at least tend thitherward, strive thitherward.</p>
<p>When you get back to Kent Terrace we shall surely see you. One of my most ardent hopes is to get out of London this summer; far away from it. I know not yet whitherward, and indeed care not much: but the demand for &#x0201C;silence&#x0201D; is getting very peremptory with me.</p>
<p>Really as Mahomet says, there ought to be &#x0201C;pearl houses&#x0201D; for us all; each his own hollow pearl of due size for living in;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The word &#x0201C;pearl&#x0201D; occurs about six times in the <hi rend="italic">Koran</hi> but not in connection with houses.

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>Your Letter has lain more weeks unanswered than I intended. I will write you a little Note today; for indeed there has been less heard of us at Scotsbrig for a while back than is usual. About ten days ago I got my Proofsheets all done; tho&#x02019; I do not know that the Books are yet <hi rend="italic">out</hi>,&#x02014;a great many things require to be done before all is ready. Probably they will come out this very day.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The 1st edn. of <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi>, and the 2d (London) edn. of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>, pbd. by James Fraser, sent to Scottish relatives and friends, <date when="1841-03-09">9 March</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410309-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1841-03-09">9 March</date></ref>.</note> Some copies of them will try to reach Ecclefechan and the kindred there, about the <date when="1841-04">beginning of April</date> I hope.&#x02014; I have sent a copy in Sheets to America; where, I suppose, they will print an edition for themselves. Jack got a copy in sheets too; not without trouble on my part: and guess only whither he sent it! Not to my Mother; not to any of you,&#x02014;but to Glen at Carstammon!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410218-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1841-02-18">18 Feb.</date></ref></note> I have laughed several times, to consider it: A place where one man only could by any chance see it, and that man not in his wits! He is a wonderful fellow, our Doctor, in some of his notions.</p>
<p>One of my projects was to get down to Ryde and see the Doctor; I wanted much to see the country at the same time. I have not gone yet, and so do not know whether I shall now go. Just as my sheets were <pb id="pg-13-52" n="13:52"/>ending I was taken ill with an <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi> which all the world has here. It is like an ugly kind of cold; weakness, aching bones, loss of appetite &#x00026;c. There is no danger attending it; but it is a very irksome disorder, and keeps you lame on the place. I did not venture out at all for some days. I have not gone up to Town even yet; I get across the Bridge<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Battersea Bridge; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400615-TC-JCA-01"><sic>12:168</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1840-06-15">15 June 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> into a kind of resemblance of country. The disease is gone now; but a considerable weakness is only yet going. I rather consider it will do me real good, were it once gone: for I have had a dull ugly kind of peculiar biliousness hanging about me for a long time. What is worst, poor Jane, just as I was getting better, fell ill of the same business; and has been keeping her bed these two days. Hers takes the shape of a sore throat: she is not very ill; I have seen her far worse every winter since we came here. She too will be clearer and better most probably were this thing once away.</p>
<p>The bright weather makes me think of the summer that is coming: I have a very great desire indeed to get out of this place, and pass the whole Summer among the green grass! If Jane did not like Puttock still worse than I do, I think I could run even <hi rend="italic">thither</hi>. But one might get a house somewhere else. Are there no houses (something like Puttoch, with a park attached) within ten miles of you? I wish you would really send us word. I am decided to consider about it. What is Newington Lodge at Annan? What is the rent of it; the nature of it?&#x02014; I am not entirely without cash; and cash, I imagine, can do little that were more grateful or more useful than get me into the free air and silence for a while. I often feel as if it would be useful for me to quit London altogether; and make my headquarters in the country, only visiting this frightful tumult when I had real business there.</p>
<p>Will you give these two Letters (two in one) to my Mother. Isabella will read them to her; they will be entertaining for a moment. I am to write to my Mother myself very shortly. Jack sent me word as from Jenny at Kirtlebridge that all was in the usual way at Scotsbrig. I have had a letter from Jean too; she had been complaining since her confinement; but professed to be well again.</p>
<p>You and Alick may consult about this of the <hi rend="italic">House</hi> in Annandale! Tell me whether there is any thing eligible; or what things there are. I do not think I will stay here thro&#x02019; the summer; and I am about as free to go to one place as another.</p>
<p>Give my love to them all; beginning with my dear Mother, ending with little Tom. Jane will send you her goodwishes next time, she hopes, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> from bed. <closer><salute>Good be with you all, good souls!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Jane is considerably better; she came out of her room for a short while last night, and today I left her quiet enough on the sofa. It was rather a kind of sore-throat that she had than influenza; and I think it is now as good as gone; at least if this beautiful weather hold.</p>
<p>As for me, I believe there is no doubt at all but the wise thing for me to do, in spite of all pusillanimities whatsoever, will be <hi rend="italic">to come off to the Isle of Wight</hi>. I decide accordingly that I will go the day after tomorrow, that is <hi rend="italic">thursday</hi>. I cannot yet tell you by what conveyance,&#x02014;except in general that it will be railway; and that I will write tomorrow again so soon as I know the hours (if indeed I can discover them). Your Rocket Coach will not do for me:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had recommended coming by &#x0201C;the Rocket coach,&#x0201D; starting from Regent&#x02019;s Circus at 9:30 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi> and arriving &#x0201C;in time for the last boat at 4 o&#x02019;clock. I could cross &#x00026; meet you at Portsmouth.&#x0201D;</note> the getting up into the <hi rend="italic">Circus</hi> at such an hour is equal to a journey itself.&#x02014; The first railway train that starts after ten o&#x02019;clock is likely to be mine: we have steamers now again, and it is altogether convenient to get off in that way.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You must be content with a very short word today; a short one, if it bring good news, will be worth a penny.</p>
<p>Jane is got out of her Influenza again; the weather has grown excellent, and she is for venturing forth today, into Cheyne Walk by the side of the River. She kept her bed three days: it was rather a sore-throat she had, and it went suddenly about its business: she never was very ill. As for me I am &#x02026; -ngth; but am still a de<supplied>[gree]</supplied> &#x02026; <supplied>[t]</supplied>han I want to be! Tomor<supplied>[row]</supplied> &#x02026; <supplied>[foreno]</supplied>on I set off for Jack and the Isle <supplied>[of Wi]</supplied>ght. I decided on that yesterday. The bright weather has awakened in me, a kind of passion for seeing the quiet fields and the sea. If I do not feel prosperous in Wight, I can easily run home again. I calculate, it will do me great good. This place is crowded, and gets ever more crowded for the next three months; the very sight and sound of it is unwholesome for me at present. After a few days of silence, I shall see better how to turn myself: the tumult of these streets will not be afflictive to me, but amusing.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-58" n="13:58"/>Yesterday a set of <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi> went off by a Steam-conveyance of Fraser&#x02019;s to Edinburgh;&#x02014;or rather it is <supplied>[today]</supplied> they are to <supplied>[go.]</supplied> I addressed them all yesterday. There <supplied>[is one]</supplied> &#x02026; for my Mother; a copy for Alick as <supplied>[the ol]</supplied>der Brother; a third copy for the kindred generally, which, when they have all done with it, may go back to Dumfries. There was also a copy both of <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> for the Ecclefechan Library. Fraser the dog allows me only 12; I have already given them <hi rend="italic">all</hi> away.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Among those given copies were Thomas Erskine (<date when="1788">1788</date>&#x02013;<date when="1870">1870</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8875"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), TC&#x02019;s good friend since <date when="1838">1838</date> (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380201-TC-JAC-01"><sic>10:18</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1838-02-01">1 Feb. 1838</date></corr></ref>), and Anna Brownell Jameson (<date when="1794">1794</date>&#x02013;<date when="1860">1860</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14631"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), author (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340506-TC-JPE-01"><sic>7:144</sic><corr>TC to JPE, <date when="1838-10-12">12 Oct. 1838</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381012-TC-ABJ-01"><sic>10:196</sic><corr>TC to ABJ, <date when="1838-10-12">12 Oct. 1838</date></corr></ref>); both wrote letters of thanks.</note> Perhaps you will get yours on Wednesday next by the Dumfries Carrier. They were all addressed to James Aitken; to whom I have written today. If any <hi rend="italic">undue</hi> delay occur (after Wednesday come a week, for instance), let me know, and I will stir them up.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; You have all copies of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, have you not? This is a much prettier one; but the same otherwise.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; The <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi> will be much <supplied>[easier?]</supplied> to read than any of my <supplied>[other?]</supplied> Books. Fr<supplied>[aser]</supplied> seems greatly contented with <supplied>[the sales?]</supplied> of it hitherto. He will have to pay me, the knave; and let <hi rend="italic">him</hi> sell it as he can!</p>
<p>I have a great many things to do, getting myself packed together. I calculate on sending you a line from Ryde. Jack writes, with great brevity, in good spirits always: he has got a <hi rend="italic">turning-room</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A room in which a lathe is operated.</note> for his Patient; and there they are, <foreign><hi rend="italic">scrieving</hi></foreign> [scraping] away, with a man to teach them to turn!</p>
<p>Jane salutes you all with her love. Jamie was to tell me about Newington Lodge:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Annan, which the Carlyles thought of renting in the summer.</note> I do not expect anything will come out of that.

<p><salute>My Dear Sir,&#x02014;</salute> The truthful genial temper manifested in your letter cannot but increase the interest I felt in you. It will be good news in <pb id="pg-13-59" n="13:59"/>all time coming to learn that such a life as yours unfolds itself according to its promise, and <hi rend="italic">becomes</hi> in some tolerable degree what it is capable of being. The problem is your own, to make or to mar; a great problem for you, as the like is for every man born into this world.</p>
<p>You have my entire sympathy in your denunciation of the &#x0201C;explosive&#x0201D; character. It is frequent in these times; and deplorable wherever met with. Explosions are ever wasteful, woeful; central fire should not explode itself, but lie silent, far down, at the centre, and make all good fruits <hi rend="italic">grow</hi>. We cannot too often repeat to ourselves, &#x0201C;strength is seen not in spasms, but in stout bearing of burdens.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>You can take comfort in the meanwhile, if you need it, by the experience of all wise men, that a right heavy burden is precisely the thing wanted for a young strong man. Grievous to be borne; but bear it well; you will find it one day to have been verily blessed. &#x0201C;I would not for any money,&#x0201D; says the brave Jean Paul in his quaint way, &#x0201C;have had money in my youth.&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201C;Jean Paul Richter Again,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 27:122.</note> He speaks a truth there, singular as it may seem to many.</p>
<p>By the way, do you read German? It would be well worth your while to learn it; and not impossible, not even difficult, even where you are, if you so resolved. These young obscure years ought to be incessantly employed in gaining knowledge of things worth knowing, especially of heroic human souls worth knowing; and you may believe me, the obscurer such years are, it is apt to be the better. Books are needed, but yet not many books; a few well read. An open, true, patient, and valiant soul is needed; that is the one thing needful.</p>
<p>I have no time here, in this immeasurable treadmill of a place, to answer letters.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your good Letter and little package of Tobacco came in safe, two nights ago, and gave me great pleasure. I smoked the Tobacco, in three successive pipes, before bedtime. My taste is none of the truest at present; something of influenza still hanging about me in that if in few other respects: but I thought the Weed a very genuine sort of thing, so far as I could judge; and indeed the <hi rend="italic">history</hi> of it would have given it a good taste independently of all else. I think however that we will not venture on importing any of it at present. The Tobacco I have here is tolerable: a large stock, in the summer time especially, is very difficult to keep, as I have found. The last stone-weight threatened at one time to spoil upon me altogether. We will let this lie, therefore; I will live in the hope of finding some of it ready at Ecclefechan, when I get thither! There will be several other things and persons that will be glad sights for me there!</p>
<p>I have never got to Wight yet; Jack still continues here; has set day after day for going, but does not go.&#x02014; Nay I find here he is at this moment, down stairs; wanting me to go somewhither with him! Perhaps I shall not get my Letter finished in that case. He is well, and never rests long; keeps his arm still in a sling, but does not mind it at all,&#x02014;has reduced the evil now to one &#x0201C;black spot&#x0201D; somewhere.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle told William Glen, <date when="1841-03-22">22 March</date>, that he had sprained his elbow and wrist hurrying to the railway station, that his hand still bothered him when writing, and that he and Ogilby had been in London for nearly a fortnight though they had meant to stay only a day or two.</note> He has a mo<supplied>[s]</supplied>t<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> enviable situation so far as the best wages, and apparently only an <hi rend="italic">imaginary</hi> employment can make any situation desirable. Whatever thing he wants done, to whatever place he wants to be carried,&#x02014;he persuades his Patient that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> (his Patient) wants it, and straightway chaises are ordered, machinery is got, and the rich Ogilvie does it, and is the better for doing it! Jack needs prudence, of course, and dexterity of management in his place; but he seems to have all that. I should not wonder if he continued in this occupation, always at liberty to quit every month, and yet not quitting for perhaps a long while.</p>
<p>I in these days do very little; read somewhat &#x00026;c. I am sitting for my Picture too: a little Painter,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Laurence (<date when="1812">1812</date>&#x02013;<date when="1884">84</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16130"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>). He did several portraits of TC in crayon, oil, and chalk, <date when="1838">1838</date>&#x02013;<date when="1841">41</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380711-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>10:118</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1838-07-11">11 July 1838</date></corr></ref>. This portrait is probably the oil shown in the Royal Academy exhibition in <date when="1841-05">early May</date>.</note> of great talent, whom I like much, has <pb id="pg-13-61" n="13:61"/>been prying about me, peering at me and watching me these three years and more, to get the real figure of my face: I say to him now, Take it, and let me have done with you! Till Thursday he keeps me sitting two hours every alternate day. It is a frightful demon-countenance hitherto, full of energy and ugliness; but Jane who has more skill than I declares that it will be an &#x0201C;admirable picture.&#x0201D; At all events I shall have done with it; let <hi rend="italic">it</hi> be what it likes to be.</p>
<p>We are very sorry to hear of the poor child&#x02019;s sickliness. Cold is above all to be guarded against; cold, and indigestible or otherwise unwholesome food. There is good hope however, as you say, in the weather, in the ever-growing power of the Sun. Encourage Jenny to be as careful of the poor little fellow as she can, till the Summer relieve her of him.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Carlyle, b. Clow (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x02013;<date when="1891">91</date>), m. since <date when="1830">1830</date> to Alexander; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301219-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:200</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-12-19">19 Dec. 1830</date></corr></ref>. The child was James.</note></p>
<p>As for us here, we get our Influenza more and more cast behind us; I mean the effects of the Influenza, for the disorder itself is properly gone long since. I have not the same almost frantic <hi rend="italic">passion</hi> for the country that I had ten days ago; yet I still think I shall go for a short time,&#x02014;most probably to Wight, were John gone. We have strong West winds now; not so bright a sky; a grey one indeed with occasional rains, which have stilled all our <date when="1841-03">March</date> dust again; but upon the whole it is beautiful weather.</p>
<p>If you could chance upon any suitable &#x0201C;lodging&#x0201D; for us in Annandale, it would be a right useful thing to let me hear of it! I continue bent on spending this summer, under the free air, out of London;&#x02014;in what quarter of the Earth is still vague enough for me! If Jane did not hate Craigenputtoch even more than I do (which Heaven knows is enough), I almost think I would put Corson out, and go thither! But at bottom it is perhaps best that one do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go thither; the Earth has other places in it; and of places as ugly, as inconvenient, and for all things but the quietude of it, as unsuitable, the Earth has not many! Annandale is terribly far off; but our dear Mother is there, you are all there. If Puttoch stood in some cultivated spot of Annandale, I believe I should try to furnish out a room or two of the house again, and keep it as a City of refuge. We must do nothing rashly. By and by I shall see better what to do. The relief from lecturing, this year, will be an immense point for me.</p>
<p>The Printed Lectures were sent off as you heard in my Mother&#x02019;s <pb id="pg-13-62" n="13:62"/>Letter. Was it last Wednesday they ought to have arrived at Ecclefechan,&#x02014;or not till this Wednesday that is coming? When they do arrive safely I shall be glad to hear. There was a copy for you; the &#x0201C;Library of Ecclefechan&#x0201D; too was not forgotten.</p>
<p>My Mother&#x02019;s kind little Letter<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1841-03-12">12 March</date> saying that &#x0201C;there is two or three rooms at Scotshbrig which you will get a most heaty welcome they are fully better than formerly we all wish <supplied>[you]</supplied> to come here and come soon. We will do all in our power to make you both comfortable for you must bring your beloved wife with you.&#x0201D;</note> came to hand, tell her, and was welcomed as all hers are. She shall hear from me again before long.&#x02014; Jack sits still down stairs; but I conjecture his patience must be at the last ebb. No more today, dear Alick.&#x02014; Commend me to every one of the kindred. Bid Jamie prosper with his sowing, but Jenny of Kirtlebrig take care of colds. My blessing with one and all of you.</p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>About an hour before the time appointed for my going to Wight to visit a Brother of mine there, the Brother himself (perverse mortal) was found sitting on the ground floor here, waiting for breakfast! He has continued in Town ever since, my Portmanteau has stood packed ever since;&#x02014;I am not returned yet, I am not yet gone, only waiting to go. My <hi rend="italic">influenza</hi>, in spite of town uproar, slowly dissipates itself; I even feel as if by and by I should be somewhat better than before.</p>
<p>On Tuesday<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1841-03-23">23 March</date>.</note> I will come to you, either during or after Breakfast,&#x02014;if I can and dare. I have a real liking for your Bishop;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes&#x02019;s friend Connop Thirlwall (<date when="1797">1797</date>&#x02013;<date when="1875">1875</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27185"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), appointed bishop of St. David&#x02019;s the previous summer; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390619-TC-JOST-01"><sic>11:132&#x02013;33</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1839-06-19">19 June 1839</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400809-TC-JOST-01"><sic>12:221</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1840-08-09">9 Aug. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> and also for another man of the party.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-63" n="13:63"/>It remains extremely credible to me, in my secret judgement, or rather it remains as if clear and undeniable, that the author of <hi rend="italic">Cecil the Coxcomb</hi> is one Richard Monkton Milnes. What do you think? I have seen nothing yet but what was quoted in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner;</hi> yet this is my inference.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The anon. novel by Mrs. Gore. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1841-03-14">14 March</date>, said: &#x0201C;Its lighter touches of society remind us of Mrs Gore, Mr Disraeli might have furnished its serious platitudes, and the happier wit and wise intention of the writer reminds us of [Bulwer&#x02019;s] <hi rend="italic">Pelham</hi>.&#x0201D;</note></p>
<p>I know not whether I should counsel the said Milnes to be more austere and &#x0201C;serious&#x0201D;;&#x02014;probably not. I will counsel him to be <hi rend="italic">sincere</hi> and ever more sincere, in his own province, in his own fashion; and to consider that there is a gift in him, which <hi rend="italic">may</hi> either be reported in Heaven&#x02019;s Treasury forevermore, or squandered in Mayfair in a few seasons,&#x02014;with unspeakable difference of profit to the said Milnes!</p>
<p>Heaven guide you, and be good to you&#x02014;</p>

<salute>Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>You are very good, first to think so many kind things about that little Book, and then to volunteer writing them to me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Though his letter is not found, what Mill said about <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> is partly shown by his comments to R. B. Fox, <date when="1841-05-06">6 May</date>: &#x0201C;That little book contains almost all his best ideas in a particularly attractive shape, &#x00026; with many explanations which he has not given elsewhere or has given only by way of allusion&#x0201D; (Mineka 13:475).</note> I may well value your approbation;&#x02014;what man&#x02019;s more? It was mine at a time when I had very few other men&#x02019;s in the world. That will be always memorable to me.</p>
<p>Something like what you say did occasionally gleam forth upon me while I wrote down those things. But now that it all lies there, little is visible but triviality, contemptibility,&#x02014;and the happy prospect of washing one&#x02019;s hands of it forever and a day. No Book of mine ever looked more insignificant to me: it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> all as if I had been trying &#x0201C;to <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> thro&#x02019; the barrel of a quill&#x0201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x0201C;A votary of the desk&#x02014;a notched and cropt serivener&#x02014;one that sucks his sustenance &#x02026; through a quill&#x0201D; (Charles Lamb, &#x0201C;Oxford in the Vacation,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Essays of Elia</hi>).</note>&#x02014;a very ineffectual song!</p>
<p>You must not abandon your reprint. The words that a man speaks from his own clear insight and belief are not so plentiful among us at present as they should be! There is good always in such words, whatever <pb id="pg-13-64" n="13:64"/>they may otherwise be. They are the only words worth printing and reprinting! Go over those Essays again; you will find much in them which the world would be no worse for a second reading of.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had been intending to rpt. his essays from the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400715-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:193</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-07-15">15 July 1840</date></corr></ref>), but was presumably discouraged because of the work involved in rewriting <hi rend="italic">Logic</hi>.

<p>I do long to see your Book on Logic;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill was rewriting his first draft, finished late autumn <date when="1840">1840</date>, of <hi rend="italic">A System of Logic</hi> (<date when="1843">1843</date>).

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter arrived last night while the Doctor sat with us at tea. His Patient was out on an Excursion to Windsor; and the Doctor had come down to spend the evening here. We deliberated upon your Letter; and it was agreed that I should write to you this morning,&#x02014;both as being in some measure the umpire of the business between John and you, and also as his sore arm is not in good order yet for writing much.</p>
<p>We find that you have omitted one essential thing: you have forgotten to tell us the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> of the Farm! This defect you must at once remedy, if any step whatever is to be taken. One cannot write to any <pb id="pg-13-65" n="13:65"/>man of business about a Farm which one does not know the name of, without giving a bad impression of one&#x02019;s own business habits. We know whereabouts the situation is; and might perhaps describe the place as a farm near Dornock which George Lowther once occupied; or we might guess that it is called &#x0201C;Dornock Mains&#x0201D; (a name you once used): but the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> itself is evidently indispensable in the first place!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lowther otherwise unidentified; Dornoch is a parish and village on the Solway Firth 3 mi. E of Annan; evidently there was the chance of a tenancy of one of the Duke of Buccleuch&#x02019;s farms, for which James would need more capital.</note></p>
<p>The Doctor, with his affectionate nature which amid all faults we all know well in him, hopes you understand that there is no brotherly act which he would not readily do to assist you. He is not grown stingy or <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> at all, that I can see,&#x02014;as some of them used to represent to me. He is a kind fellow; and he believes of you his Brother that you are a faithful industrious true-hearted man, whom it were a pleasure for him to assist. At the same time he urged very reasonably last night, that for him alone of us all the <hi rend="italic">money</hi> that he was now making was hitherto simply the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> result of his life; he had yet no home, station or family, as all the rest of us had, and except by the money which he was now earning, in a slavish uncomfortable uncertain way, he had no outlook of ever getting any home for himself. It behoved him therefore to look well before taking any step of this kind, both what was the extent of it, and what would be probably the result of it not only to himself but also to you. I could not but admit all this to be reasonable. I have no doubt too but you with your candour and justness of view will think it the same. I can speak the more freely, as it is not in my own cause: my stock of money is so inconsiderable at present, and my outlooks so complicated that, as the Doctor at once discerns, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> and not I is to take that part of the business on him. I yet owe him the half of Austin&#x02019;s money; which he declares he will not have from me till I can spare it better.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391002-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:199</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-10-02">2 Oct. 1839</date></corr></ref>; John had advanced money to Austin for the Gill, evidently with the promise of TC&#x02019;s help.</note></p>
<p>What John doubts of therefore is this: whether the &#xa3;200 for two years is not altogether a rash and erroneous calculation about what your wants in that new farm would actually be. He says he could venture &#xa3;200, and even if he were not paid in &#x0201C;two years,&#x0201D; he would think it well-spent could he do you such service; but his apprehension is that it might rather require &#xa3;400 or &#xa3;500 to get fairly into a farm of that kind; and this is a sum he could not venture. If this latter were actually the sum needed, the &#xa3;200 would of course not only be lost, but no help, nay much misery, would be entailed on you in the process <pb id="pg-13-66" n="13:66"/>of losing it. That is too plain a case; and the result would be too grievous to both parties. If this new farm has twice as much rent, will it not take almost twice as much stock as Scotsbrig; will it be actually possible to work it in the way you say?&#x02014; I have great confidence in your prudence, fairness, practical good sense and manfulness: I will therefore bid you, my dear Brother, both for John&#x02019;s sake and perhaps still more for your own, <hi rend="italic">meditate</hi> on this matter again and calculate it, not with the arithmetic of hope, but with that of doubt and rigorous practicality, and consider whether it is a thing you dare fairly commit yourself to. For Fact, when we come to try it, will be very rigid with us! If this thing do not prove practicable, it will be far better we had never meddled with it, but tried some other thing. Pray compute again therefore, and look on all sides of the affair, and then speak. Any thing you can reasonably ask, your Brother will do for you; but let it be a really executable thing, a thing which you will undertake to fulfil and stand to; not a vague semblance of a thing which when tried in practice will tumble into ruin.</p>
<p>For the rest, these preliminaries once settled, John will write to the Duke for you; tho&#x02019; he professed not to know whether it would be of much avail:&#x02014;I think it could hardly miss to be of some avail, more or less. At any rate he will write of you what he knows to be <hi rend="italic">true;</hi> adding that you are his Brother and your welfare dear to him: the Duke can then do what <hi rend="italic">he</hi> likes and finds best.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">name</hi> of the Farm therefore; and a more rigorous sceptical stern computation: these two things are wanted; so soon as you send these, John will directly bestir himself. You had better write again to <hi rend="italic">this</hi> address. The Doctor may be here or in Ryde; but it is easy to manage in either case. No time, as you say, is to be lost. The Duke is in Scotland, not here at present. Bestir yourself therefore my dear Brother; and decide like a wise candid man.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The prospective tenancy came to nothing; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410426-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1841-04-26">26</date></ref> and <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410429-TC-JWC-01"><date when="1841-04-29">29 April</date></ref>.</note>&#x02014; I have neither room nor time for

<p>Your letter found me in bed, transacting that abomination to which they have given the mellifluous Italian name <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi>&#x02014;the hardest mouthful of German gutturals would better suit it. But it would lead one into endless quarrel with the world if one should insist on everything going by its right name: so let Influenza remain Influenza; and many other things besides <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> musically, so that an unexperienced person would almost desire to have them, while they <hi rend="italic">are</hi>&#x02014;what we know. What I had to tell you, more to the purpose, is, that I got out of bed a day sooner than I should otherwise have done for fear of missing your young Hopeful;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Scot Skirving (<date when="1821">1821</date>&#x02013;<date when="1900">1900</date>), Mary Scot&#x02019;s nephew, also from Haddington, educ. Edinburgh Univ., <date when="1836">1836</date>&#x02013;<date when="1838">38</date>. Ritchie gives Skirving&#x02019;s account of the first time he saw JWC, <date when="1833-02">Feb.</date>&#x02013;<date when="1833-03">March 1833</date>: &#x0201C;I was one day following the congenial occupation of robbing sparrows&#x02019; nests in the ruined portion of the grand old church of Haddington&#x02014;&#x0201C;The Lantern of the Lothians&#x02019;&#x02014;when, to my horror, I saw Mrs Carlyle come and seat herself on her father&#x02019;s tombstone &#x02026; , and then she bowed her head and prayed and meditated for at least half-an-hour. I hesitated a moment, when she came, whether to make myself known, and be over with it; but I preferred to slink into a corner close up to the wall. &#x02026; I recognised her, because I had heard my mother and aunt talk about her, and I knew she was staying with her friends, the Donaldsons&#x0201D; (Ritchie 303).</note> and this is fact, and not <foreign><hi rend="italic">blarney</hi></foreign>. He had sent on the letter by post, with no other indication of his whereabouts than the tolerably vague one contained in the postmark &#x02018;Cheapside&#x02019;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the City.</note> so I expected from day to day that he would come to justify this unnatural proceeding. But no; and now it is so long, that I fear he is actually gone on his way, and I am not to see him at all. This is really a considerable <foreign><hi rend="italic">b&#xEA;tise</hi></foreign> [stupidity] which the young gentleman has committed at the very outset of his travels. There was Giovanni Ruffini, asking me continually &#x02018;was he come?&#x02019; having been instructed by his brother in Edinburgh<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Giovanni (<date when="1807">1807</date>&#x02013;<date when="1881">81</date>) and Agostino Ruffini (<date when="1812">1812</date>&#x02013;<date when="1855">55</date>), Italian political exiles, members of Young Italy party; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400316-TC-SWH-01"><sic>12:74</sic><corr>TC to SWH, <date when="1840-03-16">16 March 1840</date></corr></ref>. Giovanni and Mazzini had shared lodgings nr. Cheyne Row since <date when="1840-07">July 1840</date>. JWC took a great interest in Giovanni, and he, poor and lonely in an indifferent London, reciprocated by sharing with her his most intimate concerns. She was, he wrote to his mother in Italy, <date when="1840-12-18">18 Dec. 1840</date>, his protectress, the only person really interested in his precarious situation. She found him students for Italian lessons and demonstrated various kindnesses towards him every day. During the four years of his residence in England, he wrote, <date when="1841-02-27">27 Feb.</date>, JWC was the only person who had shown him &#x0201C;true sympathy&#x0201D; and made him remember that he was &#x0201C;a man who could be treated with respect and refinement.&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Lady Jane&#x0201D;&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">Monna Giovanna</hi>, as he sometimes called her&#x02014;was like a sister to him. TC was like unpolished gold (<foreign><hi rend="italic">il nostro burbero benefico, il burbero di buon cuore</hi></foreign>), and Giovanni admired him. But, he told his mother, TC did not seem properly to appreciate his wife, and their marriage could not be a happy one. Where she was all poetry and passion, he was cold and positive. When Giovanni was forced, primarily by financial considerations, to move to Paris in <date when="1841-06">June</date>, it seems to have been separation from JWC that made him mainly regret leaving London. See <hi rend="italic">Giuseppe Mazzini e I Fratelli Ruffini</hi>, ed. C. Cagnacci (Porto Maurizio, <date when="1893">1893</date>) 253&#x02013;57.</note> to show him all the second-hand <hi rend="italic">gratitude</hi> in his power to <pb id="pg-13-68" n="13:68"/>show; and Mazzini himself, the first of Italian men, the young chief of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Giovane Italia</hi></foreign> [Young Italy], had offered me some letters for him, to Florence and elsewhere. And then, only think of the stupidity of not coming to see my Husband! one of the most popular London sights at present, which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> might have seen &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">for nothing</hi>&#x02019;; not to speak of the interest which he ought to have felt in myself, who knew him before he was born, and whom he must all his life have heard tell of as an ornament to Humanity!</p>
<p>By the time he comes back from Italy, he will have learned, it is to be hoped, to look a little sharper to his own interests. Meanwhile, what can one do but recommend him to Providence?</p>
<p>I wish you had come along with him to see him safe out of the kingdom; not that I have any fears about his safety, but that I should like to have had you here, and I know that people so <hi rend="italic">rational</hi> as you are never <hi rend="italic">fatigue</hi> themselves, except for the benefit of others. If you who saw me in the Desert<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Craigenputtoch. For JWC&#x02019;s humorous account of her visit, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310420-JWC-EA-01"><sic>5:265&#x02013;66</sic><corr>JWC to EA, <date when="1831-04-20">20 April 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> saw me in Chelsea, you would admit that never was a poor woman so tried between &#x0201C;fierce extremes&#x0201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 2:599.</note> and I would like you should, that I might have a confidential fit of laughter with you over this melodramatic life which has been appointed me to live here below, or a fit of crying, whichever you liked best.</p>
<p>But among all the people I see it is so seldom I look upon a face that speaks to me of long ago&#x02014;so seldom I hear a voice with a tone of home in it. The few people I know here connected with Haddington are so <hi rend="italic">disconnected</hi>, so incompatible with the sort of thing we live in, that I have long since renounced all attempts <hi rend="italic">to piece them into it</hi>. James Aitken<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of JWC&#x02019;s suitors.</note> makes me a visit once a year or so, and brings me news tolerably out of date; and George Rennie,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x02013;<date when="1860">60</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23373"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), another early suitor; sculptor, politician, elected M.P. for Ipswich <date when="1841-07">July</date> to <date when="1842-05">May 1842</date>; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220100-JBW-EA-01"><sic>2:17</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1822-01-15">15 Jan. 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note> whom I have more of, looks always so out of humour when I speak of East Lothian!&#x02014;as is natural perhaps in <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.</p>

James was a capt. of the Royal Engineers, on half-pay since <date when="1824">1824</date>; resident engineer of Birmingham &#x00026; Gloucester Railway Co., <date when="1836">1836</date>&#x02013;<date when="1840">40</date>, currently preparing his plan for a ship canal between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea (pbd. <date when="1843">1843</date>, later acknowledged by de Lesseps); later concerned with sewerage and drainage and consulting engineer to the admiralty; m., <date when="1832">1832</date>, Alexandrina Auld (d. <date when="1853">1853</date>).

Captain Veitch, or (as my maid announced him, familiar with foreign names, and taking him on the strength of his own pronunciation for some Russian), Mr. <hi rend="italic">Keppen-witch</hi>, seems to me since I saw him last to have been &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">learning himself to be gay</hi>,&#x0201D; the result, like such attempts <supplied>[at]</supplied> the falsifying <supplied>[of]</supplied> nature, is rather <hi rend="italic">odd</hi>, to say the least of it.</p>
<p>I do not know what Augustine Ruffini wrote <hi rend="italic">to</hi> you, but I know that <hi rend="italic">of</hi> you he wrote such things as I, who do not myself deal in <foreign><hi rend="italic">couleur de rose</hi></foreign> [rose-color], should feel it indecent to repeat.

I thank you for that little notice of her; it brought all the woman before me better than the best drawn picture could have done. How I should like to assist at the eating of one of the said turkeys!

<salute>My dear Eliza</salute>
<p>We have scripture for it &#x0201C;woe unto you when all men speak well of you!&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luke 6:26.</note>&#x02014;but when one man speaks extravagantly well of you&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> I hope does not imply <hi rend="italic">woe</hi>&#x02014;otherwise your husband and you run a terrible risk!

With her unobtrusive character I was particularly struck and charmed: so unlike the flaunting fripperies with which so-called genteel society abounds&#x02014;so kind and good, yet no display or honied courtesy, but rather with a delicacy of feeling almost shy&#x02014;lustrous as the sweet evening star, yet ever gently and modestly twinkling like that serene star, as if to hide and close from observation the lustre of her excellencies.&#x0201D;</note>&#x02014;and as to laying them by with select letters, I should be afraid of their igniting the whole <pb id="pg-13-71" n="13:71"/>mass&#x02014;so I enclose them to you whom the<supplied>[y]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> chiefly concern&#x02014;I advise you to put them under glass in a frame, and hang them up over your sideboard, as George Rennie did with an address from some borough, which was ambitious of having him for it&#x02019;s representative in Parliament</p>
<p>By the way, George Rennie has been here three times within the last ten days; which I impute to his having had Influenza&#x02014;illness softens his heart always, and in rendering the present extremely disgusting to him inclines him to seek consolation from the <hi rend="italic">past</hi>&#x02014;the same phenomena occurred after his smallpox&#x02014;</p>

<salute>Dear Murray,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your kind assiduity about those Books.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray had written, <date when="1841-03-29">29 March</date>, to say he had sent &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Magopico, Naphtali, &#x00026; Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence displayed</hi>&#x0201D;; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410112-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1841-01-12">12 Jan.</date></ref> He had had to borrow some of them from the Signet Library.</note> The Parcel has not yet reached Fraser, as indeed there is usually more delay <pb id="pg-13-72" n="13:72"/>than one expects in those cases: but it will in all likelihood arrive safe; and shall then be duly welcomed and made use of. I will look at <hi rend="italic">Magapico</hi> and the rest, which I have never yet seen but once, for a short while, long ago; and will then, with all convenient despatch, add <hi rend="italic">Baillie</hi> to the lot, and pack it up for Edinburgh again. <hi rend="italic">Baillie</hi> has been read for some time;&#x02014;an excellent Book, frightfully misprinted, misedited or unedited; which requires and deserves editing more than anything I have seen of late.</p>
<p>Why I read all these things would not be easy to say. My curiosity about the Puritan Revolt in England and Scotland has always been great; repeatedly in the last twenty years I have made attempts to get some insight into it; and have gone thro&#x02019; as many dull Books as another: but always hitherto with the smallest possible effect. The Thing remains in the bodily physiognomy of it as good as invisible to me; only the unsufferable jargon and wearisome leaden Babble <hi rend="italic">about</hi> the Thing becomes plain! It is a thing I understand the soul of to my own satisfaction long since; but the <hi rend="italic">body</hi> of it I doubt is not authentically recoverable at all. Certainly no human writers had ever a more perfect talent of <hi rend="italic">killing</hi> whatsoever they wrote upon than those Historians and Memoirists of the Seventeenth Century in Britain! Given the heroic transaction, equal perhaps to the most heroic in the modern world, these are the fellows for touching it with the mace of Death, so that it lie stiff and cold, an unreadable stupifying Stupidity, to be avoided as you would an Infection and Torpedo. Since last Autumn I believe I have read some of the dullest Books ever written by any mortal. Think only of this one thing: <hi rend="italic">Whitlocke</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Memorials;</hi> see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410111-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1841-01-11">11 Jan.</date></ref></note> from beginning to end and no skipping!

<p>I am about writing to Mr Laing some Queries, perhaps this very day.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>May I, tho&#x02019; personally unknown to you, venture to trouble you with a small inquiry in the Scottish Bibliographic Department. The reputation you have attained in that, and the obliging character you bear, must be my apology.</p>
<p>For a long while, in investigating the history of the Puritans in Britain, it has been one of my impressions that the ridiculous riot which occurred in St Giles&#x02019;s Church in your City on <date when="1637-07-23">july 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, 1637</date>, was not ridiculous alone, but tragic withal,&#x02014;the first spurt as of an opening submarine ocean, which in some years more submerged the whole British Lands! An actual <hi rend="italic">tumult</hi>, and what follows out of that, is sometimes a most momentous thing. It seems to me as if the stroke of Jenny Geddes&#x02019;s stool flung at the Priest&#x02019;s head on that occasion<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The apocryphal story of Jenny Geddes who began the riot against the new prayer book in St. Giles by hurling her stool at the bishop&#x02019;s head, <date when="1637-07-23">23 July 1637</date>; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390227-TC-JF-01"><sic>11:36</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1839-02-27">27 Feb. 1839</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401026-TC-JGL-01"><sic>12:300</sic><corr>TC to JGL, <date when="1840-10-26">26 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> were the beginning of an altogether boundless universal battle, one of the <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> strokes of which cut of K. Charles&#x02019;s head.&#x02014; In brief, I have had a real curiosity to know about Jenny and her riot whatsoever thing was knowable. Hitherto my endeavours, I grieve to say, have yielded almost nothing: and I think if your reply throw no fresh light on the matter, I must give it up as a matter sunk irrecoverably in darkness;&#x02014;at any rate, as a &#x0201C;game which is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> worth the candle.&#x0201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note></p>
<p>Of all the modern Historians Brodie is the only one who details this riot with the smallest attempt at <hi rend="italic">delineating</hi> it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Brodie (<date when="1786">1786</date>&#x02013;<date when="1867">1867</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3487"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), <hi rend="italic">History of the British Empire from the Accession of Charles I, to the Restoration</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1822">1822</date>) 2:452&#x02013;56. As well as describing the riot, Brodie gives a story of a woman hitting a young man who had responded to the service by saying &#x0201C;Amen&#x0201D; in her ear as the origin of &#x0201C;the story of a woman beginning the tumult, by throwing a stool.&#x0201D; Clearly TC wanted to believe the tale in spite of Brodie&#x02019;s doubts.</note> What he gives is like a whet to a man already hungry enough! The other moderns pass the business over, as &#x0201C;beneath the dignity&#x0201D; &#x00026;c, I suppose. Neither in Baillie nor in any of the contemporaries can I find any satisfaction hitherto. In your Signet Library Catalogue, I descried some months ago a joyful reference to &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Peck</hi> v. 2&#x0201D; (p. 79, p. 1.) At the Britain Museum accordingly on two successive days I diligently consulted Peck&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Desiderata</hi>, but discovered not the smallest allusion to it there. Can <pb id="pg-13-75" n="13:75"/>you explain to me how this is;&#x02014;or what were still more interesting can you mention in what page of Peck there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> any account of the business?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laing replied, <date when="1841-04-24">24 April</date>, referring to a letter from Dr. John Cosin, <date when="1637-08-04">4 Aug. 1637</date>, reporting that &#x0201C;the very last <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> but one, after the Reading of the new Service Book &#x02026; they had like to have slaine their Bishop with Stones &#x00026; pulled him all to Pieces. &#x02026; The Tumult &#x00026; Uproar was made by 2000 of the baser Sort of People, but set on (as it is thought) by others&#x0201D; (Francis Peck, <hi rend="italic">Desiderata Curiosa</hi> [<date when="1732">1732</date>] 2:Lib. XI, art. xiii, 50).</note> I conjecture that the whole is a mistake on the part of your Predecessor; whose Catalogue otherwise seems to deserve great praise.</p>
<p>In Rothes&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Relation</hi>, one of your Bannatyne Books, I find printed as a Note by much the best relation,&#x02014;yet still far from good enough. It is vague, without names or circumstances, has no preliminaries, notes of preparation; is evidently written by a satirical partisan: one cannot construe Edinburgh and the riot out of that.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John, Earl of Rothes, <hi rend="italic">A Relation of Proceedings Concerning the Affairs of the Kirk of Scotland, from <date when="1637-08">August 1637</date> to <date when="1638-07">July 1638</date></hi>, ed. James Nairne (Edinburgh, <date when="1830">1830</date>) 197&#x02013;201, where Nairne gives in full a description of the riot supposedly written, <date when="1637-08-08">8 Aug. 1637</date>, by &#x0201C;an anonymous satirical writer.&#x0201D;</note> Yet perhaps it is the best, nay perhaps the only, Narrative attainable now?&#x02014; In the Text of <hi rend="italic">Rothes</hi> (p. 3) I find allusion made to a <hi rend="italic">trial</hi> of the rioters by the Town &#x0201C;Magistrates, Bishops and Lords of the Secret Council&#x0201D;: this, if there existed any record of this, would be the thing to consult. Perhaps you can inform me whether anybody has ever tried to find such; whether such have been found; whether, in your Edinburgh Archives anywhere, such may be supposed to exist. What is curious enough I do not find the name of Jenny Geddes mentioned at all in any of these Narrations. Where does her name come from? Tradition alone? Burns called his mare Jenny Geddes;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The mare Burns rode on an excursion to the Highlands, <date when="1787-06">June 1787</date>.</note> the Antiquarian Society has a Stool they call Jenny Geddes&#x02019;s; Kirkpatrick Sharpe insinuates (Notes to <hi rend="italic">Kirton</hi>) that Jenny had sat shortly before on the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Cutty</hi></foreign> Stool! What is the <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> of all that; where is Jenny first named in authentic history?&#x02014; Pray do not laugh; tho&#x02019; indeed I myself cannot help laughing! This thing has got to be, over and above all other considerations, partly of the nature of a puzzle to me; a thing that provokes and piques you into solving it. I consult the Secretary of the Bannatyne Club as I would the Delphic god on this occasion; the Oracle&#x02019;s response, be it negatory be it affirmatory and hopeful, shall be a guidance for me.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Sharpe&#x02019;s note to <hi rend="italic">Kirkton</hi>, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401026-TC-JGL-01"><sic>12:300</sic><corr>TC to JGL, <date when="1840-10-26">26 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>. TC had found the reference to Jenny&#x02019;s stool being in the museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Edinburgh (founded <date when="1780">1780</date>), in Nairne&#x02019;s notes (199). Nairne had acknowledged Laing&#x02019;s help in his intro. to Rothes&#x02019; <hi rend="italic">Relation</hi>, and Laing told TC, <date when="1841-04-24">24 April</date>, that he had already investigated TC&#x02019;s questions when the <hi rend="italic">Relation</hi> was in progress. He also firmly told him that &#x0201C;I am wholly unable to furnish you with any satisfactory evidence for exalting your favourite Jenny Geddes to the character of a <hi rend="italic">Heroine</hi>. In none of the Records of the time&#x02014;the Privy Council, Town Council, or contemporary writers can I find her named. The <hi rend="italic">stool</hi> shown in our Antiquarian Society may be as apocryphal as the story told by Sharpe.&#x0201D; (Replicas have recently been on sale in St. Giles.) In spite of this evidence to the contrary TC still told the legendary story in <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:96&#x02013;97), excusing it in footnotes by saying that &#x0201C;Helen of Troy, for practical importance in human history, is but a small Heroine to Jenny:&#x02014;but she has been luckier in her recording.&#x0201D; He also adduced &#x0201C;the Continuation of <hi rend="italic">Baker&#x02019;s Chronicle</hi>, by Philips (Milton&#x02019;s Nephew); fifth edition of <hi rend="italic">Baker</hi> (London, <date when="1670">1670</date>), p. 478,&#x0201D; and acknowledged Laing&#x02019;s help. He is somewhat clearer about his purpose in the drafts of <hi rend="italic">Historical Sketches:</hi> &#x0201C;There remains the shadow of her name. As Hercules represents whole generations of Heraclides and their work; as Marat in our compressive imagination did all the Reign of Terror; so Jenny is the rascal multitude. &#x02026; Her name is not mentioned for Twenty-five or thirty years afterwards in any book; nevertheless it remains lively to this day in the mouth of Scottish tradition,&#x0201D;&#x02014;and he refers to Burns. It is one of the crucial indications of TC&#x02019;s approach to history. He wanted to believe in her, but knew she was merely legendary; yet the legend itself was fact. There are further drafts about Jenny Geddes in the FC.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-76" n="13:76"/>
My curiosities do by no means restrict themselves to Jenny Geddes and her one riot: the whole of those transactions in Scotland, the Signing of the Covenant, Assembly at Glasgow &#x00026;c &#x00026;c are full of interest to me.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The National Covenant was the manifesto signed all over Scotland, <date when="1638">1638</date>, by which the subscribers swore to defend the protestant religion and to resist all contrary errors and corruptions. The Glasgow Assembly, <date when="1638-11">Nov. 1638</date>, deposed the bishops and repudiated the king&#x02019;s innovations in worship.</note> But, alas, insight seems not attainable on them, in any sense of the word. Let me put a question or two nevertheless, now that my hand is in.</p>
<p>Besides <hi rend="italic">Sir James Turner&#x02019;s Memoirs</hi>,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410222-TC-DA-01">TC to DA, <date when="1841-02-22">22 Feb.</date></ref></note> is there any contemporary account of Scotch Military matters worth much? Montrose, for example, is entirely unintelligible in <hi rend="italic">Wishart;</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Wishart (<date when="1599">1599</date>&#x02013;<date when="1671">1671</date>), chaplain to Montrose, <date when="1644">1644</date>, pbd. an account of Montrose&#x02019;s campaigns in Latin, <date when="1647">1647</date>, trans. as <hi rend="italic">Compleat History of the Warrs in Scotland under &#x02026; Montrose</hi> (<date when="1660">1660</date>).</note> Napier&#x02019;s last Book has real worth;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mark Napier, <hi rend="italic">Life and Times of Montrose</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1840">1840</date>).</note> many curious quotations and glimpses, but still leaves much to desire. Does anybody know anything about the old Earl of Leven,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Leslie (<date when="1580">1580</date>?&#x02013;<date when="1661">1661</date>), 1st earl of Leven, soldier with the Swedish army, <date when="1605">1605</date>&#x02013;<date when="1638">38</date>; leader of the Covenanters&#x02019; army against Charles I; later he was for Charles II.

<salute>Dearest Jeannie,</salute>
<p>The last look thy face wore today has haunted me all the way hither! I will write half a word before going to bed;&#x02014;tho&#x02019; in a Traveller&#x02019;s-room, with two bagmen dining and conversing on one side of the apartment, and Milnes diligently reading a Tragedy of Landor&#x02019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Savage Landor (<date when="1775">1775</date>&#x02013;<date when="1864">1864</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15980"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:365</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March 1833</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400401-TC-RWE-01"><sic>12:93&#x02013;94</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1840-04-01">1 April 1840</date></corr></ref>. His most recent tragedy was <hi rend="italic">Fra Rupert</hi> (<date when="1840">1840</date>), the last pt. of a trilogy begun with <hi rend="italic">Andrea of Hungary</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Giovanna of Naples</hi>.</note> at the other side of my table; two blazing jets of gas flaming away right overhead.</p>
<p>We did not arrive here till towards Nine; not from any accident, but because it was the usual rate of going for our Machine on this railway. We got along without the slightest accident; comfortable enough. Sir R. Peel&#x02019;s eldest son,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert (<date when="1822">1822</date>&#x02013;<date when="1895">95</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21765"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 3d bart.; he had just left Harrow and was about to enter Christ Church, Oxford; later a diplomat, then M.P. for Tamworth, <date when="1850">1850</date>&#x02013;<date when="1880">80</date>. TC&#x02019;s prediction was correct.</note> and the heir apparent of some Lord whose name I forget, sat in the same Carriage with Richard and me: harmless lads, full of civility, who will never set the Thames on fire. They left us, the last of them left us at Tamworth, some twenty miles short of this. Our weather was of the brightest: I sat looking out at the green spring fields, the beautiful honest-looking villages and hamlets; it is many a year since I had <hi rend="italic">seen a Spring day;</hi> this was a kind of sample of spring,&#x02014;rich in all kinds of sad and tender recollections for me  The village of <hi rend="italic">Ivanhoe</hi> (Iv<hi rend="italic">ing</hi>hoe, they spell it), standing at <pb id="pg-13-79" n="13:79"/>the base of a Knot of smooth bare green hills or Knolls among the kindly <hi rend="italic">croft-lands</hi> of Buckinghamshire,&#x02014;Hampden&#x02019;s old property,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hampden (<date when="1594">1594</date>&#x02013;<date when="1643">1643</date>), statesman; his estate at Great Hampden was ca. 9 mi. S of Ivinghoe.</note> the scene of Scotts novel,&#x02014;this and some other things I have <hi rend="italic">gained</hi> today.</p>
<p>Milnes and I get along beautifully hitherto. He has read Oxford Tracts<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Tracts for the Times. By Members of the University of Oxford</hi>, written by J. H. Newman, E. B. Pusey, and others, <date when="1833">1833</date>&#x02013;<date when="1841">41</date>. Milnes was preparing his pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">One Tract More</hi> (<date when="1841">1841</date>), a plea for tolerance of the Tractarians&#x02019; views.</note> &#x00026;c all the way; argued and talked in the smartest manner. We snatched up a &#x0201C;plate of mutton broth&#x0201D; at some midway station; other dinner was not attainable. Tea and mutton-chops, in a very respectable style, was furnished us here. I managed to smoke <hi rend="italic">three</hi> cigars,&#x02014;two of them in the railway, in spite of regulations. My bed for tonight looks out on the Street here, on the intersection of <hi rend="italic">three</hi> Streets, in this centre of Derby: but still there is some prospect of sleeping. We set off again at nine in the morning; shall arrive about one or two I fancy. M&#x02019;s servant manages all the luggage &#x00026;c; it is the easiest travelling one could have.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; On the whole, Dearest, didst thou ever receive written on paper any more perfect <hi rend="italic">clatter</hi> than this I now write? Never! And yet is not clatter as good as sense; in one point of view, better?</p>

<salute>Dearest,</salute> 
<p>According to the Program you would receive from Derby, we got hither yesterday about 2 O&#x02019;clock. My fate at Derby was none of the brightest: bed at half past one o&#x02019;clock (to make sure of quiet), then awoke again by the stroke of five! However, one must put up with the accidents of the road. I was not so miserable as might have been expected, at least not till late last night when I had got worn out. This Country is altogether like a beautified kind of Scotland: streams of water, fields alternating of green and of red, with hawthorn hedges, honest-looking unclipt trees all in bud: the silent sight of it for some hours yesterday afternoon did me real benefit. To finish the <hi rend="italic">bulletin</hi> part of the business,&#x02014;I awoke this morning again at six (woe&#x02019;s me, for it was after <hi rend="italic">one</hi> before I lay down),&#x02014;but gradually, in spite of noisy servants, in spite of all things, I fell first into sluggish torpor, the<supplied>[n]</supplied> gradually into <hi rend="italic">treacle</hi> sleep, and so lay sound as a stone till half past ten. My hope and expectation is that I shall improve in health here: if I could get <hi rend="italic">riding</hi> out among these silent fields and rough country lanes, I should amend fast; nay perhaps I shall get riding, but the prospect is rather a hope than any certainty yet. There seems to be a superabundance and yet a practical defect of horses here,&#x02014;as is the way with several things in this world!</p>
<p>&#x0201C;Richard&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes.</note> made me dismount some two miles on <hi rend="italic">your</hi> side of our appointed goal in the railway, and walk homewards, by a smarter way, thro&#x02019; woods over knolls. Walking was not my <foreign>forte</foreign>; however, I persevered, and did well enough. Over rough-looking spaces (somewhat <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; la</hi></foreign> &#x0201C;Slodahill,&#x0201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nr. Alexander&#x02019;s old farm of Catlinns.</note> some of them, we got at last to the Fryston Mansion, a large irregular pile, of various ages, rising up among ragged old wood, in a rough large park, also all sprinkled with trees, grazed by sheep and horses,&#x02014;a park chiefly beautiful because it did not set up for beauty. Ancient-looking female figures were visible thro&#x02019; the windows, as we drew nigh. Mrs Milnes,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henrietta Maria Milnes, b. Monckton (<date when="1789">1789</date>&#x02013;<date when="1847">1847</date>), second da. of 4th Viscount Galway, m. <date when="1808">1808</date>.</note> a tall ancient woman, apparently of weak health and nerves, of motherly kind heart, curiously buckramed in oldfashioned stately politeness; on the whole a prepossessing <pb id="pg-13-81" n="13:81"/>woman: she welcomed us at the door of the drawing-room &#x0201C;in the silence of the stately hall.&#x0201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> In the drawing-room itself sat or soon arrived &#x0201C;three Aunts&#x0201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably his unmarried aunts, Louisa, Caroline, and Amelia Jane Milnes, his father&#x02019;s three youngest sisters.</note> all of whom Richard successively kissed on the cheek, and introduced me to: I have not yet learned their names, but shall. They are devout women; the youngest of them not much above your age; they have been long in Rome, know our brother Jack (by repute), Edward Irving<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x02013;<date when="1834">1834</date>); see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170212-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:92</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1817-02-12">12 Feb. 1817</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x00026;c;&#x02014;are not without intelligence of a grave slightly <hi rend="italic">ligneous</hi> politeness; stiff in their Tory theorems, in their saintships &#x00026;c, not without a dash of gigmanity: comparable to the dear Donaldsons,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean, Jess, and Kate Donaldson; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400603-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:160</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-06-03">3 June 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> perhaps, or other of that respectable <foreign>genus</foreign>. What is worst, they seem to expect me to talk to them, when we meet,&#x02014;which however is not so frequently as to be burdensome.&#x02014; The last member of the family, to whom I had to pay my <foreign>devoir</foreign>, was the head of it, the elder Milnes;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Pemberton Milnes (<date when="1784">1784</date>&#x02013;<date when="1858">1858</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18794/18795"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), M.P. for Pontefract, <date when="1806">1806</date>&#x02013;<date when="1818">18</date>; lived abroad, <date when="1828">1828</date>&#x02013;<date when="1835">35</date>, to economize as he had made himself responsible for his brother&#x02019;s gambling and racing debts. After inheriting his wife&#x02019;s stepmother&#x02019;s estate at Bawtry and his mother&#x02019;s at Fryston, <date when="1835">1835</date>, the family came to Fryston, where he took up his life as a Yorkshire squire. He had had a bad riding accident, <date when="1840">1840</date>, and was subject to ill health and depression for the rest of his life. Reid says that Milnes had brought TC to Fryston partly &#x0201C;to see the effect which one original mind had on another&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:251).</note> a tall greyhaired lean figure, rather lame at present, whom we found smoking cigars and reading in a large old Library he has: I have not yet made <hi rend="italic">him</hi> out,&#x02014;except that he seems at basis a true hearted well-affectioned man, of a fluttering nervous temperament, of much embarrassment, timidity, at times a kind of momentary stutter even,&#x02014;thro&#x02019; all which his natural intelligence and honesty (cased too, I think, in some disappointed pride, gigmanity, country Toryism) shines out, very considerably obstructed! Perhaps we shall grow better acquainted yet. He seems to like me somewhat, and fear me still more, that is, fear the embarrassment of me; and resides chiefly in his Library.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reid gives an account of the conversation at their first meeting. While smoking cigars, Milnes, in response to TC&#x02019;s admiration of the view, expressed regret at a factory chimney on the horizon spoiling the view. TC replied: &#x0201C;Spoiled the view! &#x02026; why, sir, I think that is just the pleasantest feature in the whole bit of scenery. It shows that somebody is doing something in this part of the world, at any rate&#x0201D; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:254&#x02013;55).</note> &#x0201C;Richard&#x0201D; is the soul of all; without Richard we were a ruined nation. Let us wait, let us see.</p>
<p>One&#x02019;s Goody is one&#x02019;s self; therefore there is no harm in telling <hi rend="italic">you</hi> all these crudities: but my good Jeannie knows, none better, that <pb id="pg-13-82" n="13:82"/>th<supplied>[ere]</supplied> would be most condemnable harm in uttering any whisper of them to any other person whatever; wherefore let the <foreign>lassie</foreign> be <hi rend="italic">discreet</hi>,&#x02014;mum to all the world! I add only one other fact, that I am lodged in a bedroom with four enormous windows, which look out over woody garden-spaces and other silent ruralities: the apartment furnished as for Prince Albert and Queen Victory; the most absurd place I ever lived in (when I look at myself and my equipment) in this world. I am charged to smoke in it too; I have a fire in it all day; I now write in it to thee. The bed seems to be about eight feet wide; a ladder conducts you to it if you like. Of my paces the room measures fifteen from end to end,&#x02014;forty-five feet long, height and width proportional; with ancient dead-looking portraits of queens, Kings, Straffords and principalities; with buhl cabinets, wardrobes of &#x0201C;Hon<hi rend="italic">dur</hi>as May&#x02019;ogany&#x0201D; with carving and veneering;&#x02014;really the uncomfortablest acme of luxurious comfort that any Diogenes<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Greek cynic philosopher (ca. <date>412&#x02013;323 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>).</note> was set into in these late years! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ex uno disce omnia</hi></foreign> [From one you may learn all].</p>
<p>O my dear, what clatter. But to thee it will be welcome. Think not hardly of me, dear Jeannie: in the mutual misery we often are in we do not know how dear we are to one another. By the help of Heaven, I shall get a little better, and somewhat of it shall abate Write instantly; say how you are, how all is. Last night at dinner, Richard made them all laugh with a saying of yours: &#x0201C;When the wife has influenza, it is <hi rend="italic">a slight cold;</hi> when the man has&#x0201D; &#x00026;c.&#x02014; Remember me to Darwin. Tell me about everything;&#x02014;especially that you are getter [getting] stronger</p>

<p>Virtue its own reward? &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Never</hi> Sir&#x0201D;!&#x02014; Had you been neglectful and sent me no letter yesterday, some scriblement better or worse would have proceeded from me yesterday&#x02014; But the <hi rend="italic">receiving</hi> of your letter assuaged those wants of my heart (to speak in the language of the Minerva press<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Early nineteenth-cent. press, in Leadenhall St., known for publishing sentimental novels.</note>) which would else have sought assuagement in writing to you&#x02014;and besides&#x02014;that letter on glazed paper, written with the best of pens, beautiful outwardly and inwardly, gave me such an ideal of what you would expect of what you were entitled to in &#x0201C;return,&#x0201D; that I had no longer assurance enough to put you off with one of my rough and ready scrawls, which, as Goddess of Chaos, presiding over the rumbling and tumbling of a first-rate earthquake, and with a considerable of a headach at the same time, was the best I could have done for you. Today I thought I should be able to write copper plate, to spell, and to put my words together, if not with a certain grace, at lowest with a certain intelligibility. And you see!&#x02014; But &#x0201C;it is of no use rebelling against Providence&#x0201D;!&#x02014; And so I will carry on and &#x0201C;keep never minding&#x0201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably coterie speech.</note>&#x02014;</p>
<p>No letters have come except your own&#x02014;and your own having come no others are missed&#x02014; Thank Heaven it is no worse with you!&#x02014; So far as I can read your horoscope at this distance it seems to me pretty fairish&#x02014; I have great faith in your <hi rend="italic">young</hi> host<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes was nearly thirty-two.</note>&#x02014;in fact I believe we might have &#x0201C;riddled Creation&#x0201D; without finding a man better fitted for taking charge of you &#x0201C;under difficult circumstances.&#x0201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first quotation coterie speech, the second possibly.</note> If he brings you <pb id="pg-13-86" n="13:86"/>back <hi rend="italic">a gladder and a foolisher</hi> man,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. penultimate line of &#x0201C;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.&#x0201D;</note> I shall be under eternal obligations to him&#x02014;say so with my kind regards&#x02014;</p>
<p>Darwin came yesterday &#x0201C;fully confident of finding Carlyle still here&#x0201D;&#x02014; He staid but a short while, having to call for &#x0201C;old M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pepoli&#x0201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Pepoli, whom the Carlyles regarded as elderly (though only about seven years older than TC).

TC replied, according to Mazzini, &#x0201C;in terms sufficiently flattering about me&#x0201D; (letter to his mother, <date when="1841-03-24">24 March</date>, trans., <hi rend="italic">Scritti di Mazzini</hi> [Imola, <date when="1914">1914</date>] 10:121).

<p><salute>Many thanks, dear <foreign>Bairn</foreign>,</salute> for your brisk kind little Letter, which was handed in to me yesterday morning. The Flunky in red quilted coat walked solemnly round the breakfast table with his silver salver, laying Letter after Letter on it, for this and the other; and behold at last there was one for me too. I escaped with it into the air, to read it there at leisure. Happily nothing is wrong; nothing is worse than I expected, all is rather better.</p>
<p>I have no time or means today to send you right <hi rend="italic">news</hi> of what is going on here; it would take such a length of time to make any clear description of it: I merely write to signify that I am still swimming along in this wondrous element, and that nothing goes amiss with me as yet. That will season your slice of bread for you on Saturday sufficiently. <pb id="pg-13-88" n="13:88"/>Pour a glass of sherry for yourself, and read such news thankfully to the relish of that.</p>
<p>All would be well and supremely well with me here,&#x02014;if <hi rend="italic">I could but sleep</hi>. A small faculty, but an important one! You know my talent that way, especially in such <hi rend="italic">lionizing</hi> occasions: ah me! Nevertheless, after the most tumultuous watchings, sluggings and tumblings thro&#x02019; the night-watches, I get up wonderfully cheery; a <hi rend="italic">cigar</hi> smoked in the open sunshine, amid the sound of trees, with one&#x02019;s foot on the soft grass, sets me quite up again; and I meet the household at their &#x0201C;halfpast ten&#x0201D; breakfast with a cheerful kind of heart. We <hi rend="italic">dine about eight</hi>, and I am here acting as a Lion&#x02014;cannot get out of it: <foreign><hi rend="italic">tout est dit</hi></foreign> [all is said]!&#x02014; But I have had one long ride; mean to get another this day (unless the rain return); it is above all a <hi rend="italic">new kind</hi> of shatterment that I suffer, and therefore a relief from the old. I believe I am getting quieter and better in spite of the very Devil. Enough of that for one time.</p>
<p>&#x0201C;Richard,&#x0201D; I find, lays himself out while in this quarter to do hospitalities, and of course to collect notabilities about him, and play them off one against the other. I am his trump card at present. The Sessions are at Pontefract even now, and many Lawyers there; these last two<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201C;Three&#x0201D; has been crossed out.</note> nights he has brought a trio of Barristers to dine,&#x02014;producing champagne &#x00026;c: plate, &#x0201C;of massy <hi rend="italic">silver</hi>,&#x0201D; four or five embroidered lackeys and the rest of it, are the order of all days.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Just about an hour before leaving London I received Jean&#x02019;s Letter, naturally with great pleasure; and sent it off to Jack at Ryde to whom also it would have welcome news. Another Letter, which I had just received <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Jack, was appointed to be sent on to you at Dumfries, and Jane writes to me here that she has done it. She would naturally tell you where I was, and give you some hints about motions and position: but I daresay you are daily looking for some authentic word at first hand; and daily ever since Wednesday, my second day here, have I been determined to write: but never till this morning could I get a chance; and, alas, it is only &#x0201C;twenty minutes&#x0201D; that I have:&#x02014; Well, dear good Mother, these twenty minutes shall be yours.</p>
<p>My kind Landlord here is a Mr Milnes a Member of Parliament and young literary man whom I have known for several years, and liked much: such a blithe, kindhearted intelligence in him; I have always a real pleasure to see him in the whirl of London. His Father and Mother reside here (it is some twenty or thirty miles off Hull,&#x02014;or by another direction, it is perhaps some sixty miles <hi rend="italic">eastward</hi> of Manchester). Well, &#x0201C;Richard Monkton Milnes Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi> M.P.&#x0201D; &#x00026;c being, like others at this time, midnded<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in text.</note> to have three weeks of &#x0201C;Easter holidays&#x0201D; as men name them, set about persuading me to get into the Railway with him, and so here I am! We arrived on Tuesday after a very prosperous drive, divided in two by a night at Derby. The Country is different from London country; it is a kind of beautified fertile Annandale;&#x02014;most delightful to me to look upon at present. The people too are most kind polite people, and Richard is the best landlord man ever had. I am lodged literally as if I were a Duke or Serene Highness: my <hi rend="italic">bedroom</hi>, to take only one item is 15 paces (45 feet) in length! Fires kept up all day, troops of flunkies waiting to tie your shoes &#x00026;c &#x00026;c, all this goes on to a length that seriously encumbers me. The people live in a great way, have quantities of company; I regret <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> here but that. For I wanted to <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> and be quiet; and my sleeping here is hitherto none of the best,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; my bed is some 8 feet square, a perfect <hi rend="italic">sea</hi> of down, which you mount into by a ladder. Alas, as Dick of Paddickha&#x02019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> use to say in prayer, &#x0201C;What&#x02019;s ta use o&#x02019; a&#x02019; their grandeur, <pb id="pg-13-93" n="13:93"/>when the flames o&#x02019; Hell come and burn&#x02019;t a&#x02019;?&#x0201D; That is too like the case of a sleepless man in a sea of down! However, we have now got two horses, and are to ride forth like lions this very day in few minutes; this I have no doubt at all will do me good. I am also about to make certain changes in my diet, and way of management (for they let me take my own way altogether, the good people): on the whole, I hope to have acquired the sleeping talent too before long. It will then be <hi rend="italic">all</hi> right.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; Thus you see what I am about, dear Mother; this will serve better than nothing for the present: You shall have another Letter in a day or two, I hope; the instant anything is settled about my <hi rend="italic">future</hi> movements, I will certainly endeavour to write. Consider me as admirably well off; a man only too well off!</p>
<p>Jack ought to be arriving at Richmond today, which is within nine miles of London, only seven from Chelsea. His arm still disinclines to write; otherwise he has nothing to complain of: the Letter you got by Jane is the last I heard from him. I wrote yesterday.&#x02014; Jamie of Scotsbrig will be in great anxiety about his Farm: one may hope he will get it, and be able to do well in it, poor fellow. I send a Newspaper to Alick today from Wakefield (whither we are riding). If Jean would enclose this Letter to him, perhaps&#x02014;?&#x02014; Tell Jean how I thank her for her little Note: I will answer before long. Did Mrs Welsh send her the <hi rend="italic">Tablet?</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Roman Catholic weekly; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400516-TC-JF-01"><sic>12:145</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1840-05-16">16 May 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> Here is another review of me in the <hi rend="italic">M. Chronicle</hi>, which I despatch for perusal among friends. Jane sent it me this morning; and along with it a slip of abuse out of the chief blackguard Newspaper of England:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the reviews, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410407-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1841-04-07">7 April</date>]</ref>.</note> that I do <hi rend="italic">not send you;</hi> tho&#x02019;, indeed, it is little inferior to the praise, if you understood it. But no praise I have got is like what Jean tells me, of your <foreign><hi rend="italic">greeting</hi></foreign> [weeping] to read my account of Luther and Knox. My dear Mother! It is <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that taught me to lecture in that way;&#x02014;really so.&#x02014; No room for more.&#x02014; <closer><salute>Your affectionate,</salute></closer> <name>T.

Your Mother&#x02019;s approbation is also very agreeable to me, and my own Mother&#x02019;s &#x0201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">greeting</hi></foreign> [weeping] over Knox &#x00026; Luther.&#x0201D; And now, at last, I do think we are very sufficiently applauded and approved;&#x02014;and ought if possible to go and do something <hi rend="italic">deserving</hi> a little applause!</p>
<p>Sleep prospers somewhat better with me now: all the rest was and is as well as it need be wished. I wrote last time <hi rend="italic">with the remains of a pill in me;</hi> you know me then! It should always be specified at the top of the sheet. I had, after that, close following on that, another wretched night: but on the morrow Richard who had been bestirring himself in the interim, produced, besides his own horse, a respectable sharp-footed galloway (got &#x0201C;from the neighbourhood,&#x0201D; he says, borrowed or hired perhaps from one of his farmers), and invited me to ride with him to Wakefield, twelve miles off, not to speak of detours in search of the picturesque. Nay he did not plague me with the picturesque either, the good Richard; on my declaring that simple knolls and fields with brooks and hedges among them were the best of all for me, and the picturesque a mere bore, he admitted that partly at bottom it was so to him also, and probably to all men. I like Richard better and better; a most goodhumoured, kind cheery-hearted fellow, with plenty of <foreign><hi rend="italic">savoir-faire</hi></foreign> in him too. He answered me the other day when asked, If he liked Spenser&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Faery Queen?</hi> &#x0201C;Is it as a <hi rend="italic">public</hi> question that you ask me, or as a private confidential one?&#x0201D; Nobody could answer better. By the bye, you may tell Darwin that R. did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> write <hi rend="italic">Cecil</hi>, nor that Quarterly Review Article;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably &#x0201C;State of Society and Education in France,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">QR</hi> 67 (<date when="1841-03">March 1841</date>): 394&#x02013;436, a review of Girardin&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">De L&#x02019;Instruction Publique en France</hi> (Paris, <date when="1840">1840</date>), in fact by H. H. Milman. It refers to &#x0201C;our friend Mr. Carlyle&#x02019;s very eloquent &#x02018;Chartism&#x02019;&#x0201D; (406).</note> both of which items of intelligence, <pb id="pg-13-95" n="13:95"/>at least the former, will be welcome news to the man of closed lips, who rather likes Richard.</p>
<p>The lady Galway went off on Saturday, but talked of returning with her husband on Wednesday, when, as I gather by ominous indications, there is to be a dreadful field-day here. I was not able to make much of the young lady: she seemed desirous to talk, but unused to it, unable; I gathered rather by her ways of <hi rend="italic">singing</hi>, of looking, laughing &#x00026;c, that she had more in her than she <hi rend="italic">could</hi> speak all at once. She has had much sickness; has no children, great wealth, a hunting husband, and professes to read <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Goethe:</hi> think of all that. I refused to go to her place<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Serlby Hall, nr. Blyth, Notts.</note> at present as decisively as was polite: but Richard has not given it up yet, the dog. We shall see what kind of man the husband is: above all, we shall see how we sleep;&#x02014;it is but so so, hitherto. With the rest of the family I continue well, but make no progress towards intimacy; indeed, except mutual good-will, I think there is not much more possible. Gig and No-gig, unless some depth of intelligence or originality of character happen to connect them, cannot get well into union. The eldest Aunt, a pale sickly woman (in figure too, an English edition of Miss Donaldson),<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa Milnes and Jean Donaldson.</note> who speaks far the least, pleases me the best: she zealously follows Calvinistic Church-of-Englandism; makes remarks which indicate sincerity and insight; looks over upon me sometimes with a pale kind smile, which I like. &#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; Richard&#x02019;s ride to Wakefield, where we saw a smoky spinning Town, and an ancient Socinian lady named Gaskill (sister-in-law, I think, of the <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> Gaskill<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either Mary, b.

<p><hi rend="italic">Tuesday Noon</hi>.&#x02014; Alas, Goody, we never got home last night till near six, an hour after the post leaves <hi rend="italic">Ferrybridge</hi> not to speak of Fryston! I take time by the forelock this morning again.</p>
<p>The &#x0201C;Dragon of Wantley&#x0201D; is Lord Wharncliff, so nicknamed hearabouts; a solemn old Tory Lord, judging the people in quarter-sessions at Pontefract in these days; who, by his advent hither, raised the steam almost to bursting of boilers. I found him innocent, wooden-limited, a very good old Dragon, and was heartily content to see him take his leave last night positively for the last time. We had three nights of him, nay properly four, and the steam always up.</p>
<p>Last night moreover we had the James Marshall&#x02019;s Wife and man: Miss Spring Rice that was sits now flowering in the Drawing-room, with Richard and ladies; James I suppose is out to walk with the elder Mr Milnes. They look well enough, both. He a shade older, a shade more at his ease in Zion;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amos 6:1.</note> she much the same as before. They are ardent to get me up to Headingley: but I tell them I am a waiter on Providence, and know not whitherward I am bound at all. They do not seem to promise any very particular solacement to me, if I go: we shall see. Indeed I have yet talked little with either of them, being in a crowd of people.</p>
<p>Today either, no news. Indeed I did not deserve any; being in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> debt: yet somehow I thought a Notekin would come.&#x02014; Have you heard anything of Jack yet and Richmond? I wrote to him addressing &#x0201C;Post-Office&#x0201D; there: not a word of response.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Since a penny will carry a Letter anywhither, it seems a pity that I should not tell you I am here, which perhaps you do not otherwise know. I have written to my Mother at Dumfries; but there is no saying whether they would send you any word about it. A Doncaster Newspaper, sent to Jamie, would be <hi rend="italic">enigmatic</hi> rather than otherwise if you knew no more. Take one word from me therefore; a word of brotherly affection and remembrance if of nothing other. Poor old Ecclefechan! It is so strange to think of all your simple doings there, in such a whirl of things as this! Poor old Ecclefechan; dear to me, with the kind souls that are there and thereabouts; ever dear to me, go whither I may!</p>
<p>This place is in Yorkshire, in the region of Leeds, Hull and Wakefield; somewhat nearer <hi rend="italic">you</hi> than it is to London. It is the Mansion of a young man of fortune, and of Literature withal, an M.P. &#x00026;c, by name Richard Milnes, whom I have known since we came to live in London, a man whom I greatly like, and who likes me. These people fly all out of Town for some three weeks about this time, to what they call the &#x0201C;Easter holidays.&#x0201D; Being disappointed of Wight in the way you heard, and having still a boundless appetite for the country, Milnes also asking me, and offering as it were to <hi rend="italic">take</hi> me, I found I ought to go; and <pb id="pg-13-98" n="13:98"/>so we bundled off on Monday gone a week by railway, and here I am for the seventh day now. We are a great family, with endless troops of flunkies, large dinners of Lords dames and squires, a most restless whirlpool of a concern; but I have a room of my own, a horse to ride, books to read; the fields are beautiful, the country almost like old Scotland; on the whole, it does me good, in spite of the lords and dinners. I am likely to be here or hereabouts for a week more yet: whither I shall go <hi rend="italic">next</hi> is not made out yet; sometimes I think of Annandale, being already half-way or more, but the weather I fear is too cold yet. One thing only is is<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in text.</note> made out: that I do not mean to pass the summer in London; that, with all probability I can hope to see you all before long somehow or other.</p>
<p>Jack was to remove to Richmond, almost close on London and Chelsea, on Saturday last; I have written thither to him, but got no answer yet. A lame arm he had which rather hindered him in writing. He will likely hang about the region he is now in, off and on, for some time yet.</p>
<p>Jamie&#x02019;s Letter about the Farm came just before I left London. Tell him how anxious I am to hear of his success. It must be decided soon. Pray write, one of you, the moment anything is settled. If within a week of this date, send the Letter hither; after that, or indeed at any time, &#x0201C;Chelsea.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>I add not a word, but blessings to one and all of you. Good be ever in you and about you, dear Alick, and all your dear ones!&#x02014; <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>I will contrive to indicate by some Newspaper or the like, which way I go.&#x02014;&#x0201C;Care of R. M. Milnes Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi> M.P. &#x00026;c/Fryston/Ferrybridge&#x0201D;</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Wifie,</salute>
<p>Are you <hi rend="italic">ill;</hi> or what has befallen? Why in the world do you not write to me, one scrape of a pen, franked by a stamp worth one penny?&#x02014; I really begin to be seriously alarmed that you are not as you should be. Pray write <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi>, if you are not at this very instant doing it. I shall not know what in the world to make of it if I do not hear tomorrow or next day.</p>
<p>I am going to Headingley Leeds<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit James Garth and Mary Alicia Marshall.</note> on Saturday (<hi rend="italic">after</hi> post-time), at least I have written today to propose doing that. The Galways are <pb id="pg-13-99" n="13:99"/>here, and want me into Nottinghamshire; but that does not look very promising. We shall see. The Husband is a good, brisk spirited young man for a hunter: the Lady <hi rend="italic">continues</hi> to be a dry fountain,&#x02014;I begin to fear now, no fountain, but a dry <hi rend="italic">cistern</hi>&#x02014; I stay at Headingley till Monday; it is not above 20 miles off this, and by railway.</p>
<p>Write; for God&#x02019;s sake write, even if you are ill.</p>

A woman cannot, in her turn, be to the man all that he is to her&#x02014;she cannot (except in rare cases) be the first and last object of life to him. All the great business affairs of the world must get themselves transacted by men, and only occupation that comes by necessity&#x02014;and not, as a woman&#x02019;s occupation does, from a voluntary setting about something to avoid idleness&#x02014;will prevent the most desperate devotion and the most sublime affection from being other than secondary to the daily grand business affairs which keep society in shape and going. Added to which, a man does not, in a general way, understand our refinements in the matter of love; owing to our having little real occupation, our own female branch of the subject has been much more highly cultivated and comes to a greater perfection than with men; we love with a desire to give them pleasure&#x02014;they love us to please themselves&#x0201D; (Ireland 1, 4&#x02013;5). Even in her first letters there is much about love and marriage, though it is not clear how far, or what, JWC had already confided in her. She writes with extraordinary warmth and intensity, even at the start of a friendship of which Mrs. Ireland says, &#x0201C;if it did not &#x02018;pass the love of woman,&#x02019; it certainly reached the utmost boundary of which that sacred &#x02018;relationship of the spirit&#x02019; is capable&#x0201D; (vi). They made a pact to see that their letters did not survive them, but JWC d. without keeping her side of the agreement and so, as Mrs. Ireland explains, they did survive and were presumably passed to Jewsbury by TC. As she was dying, Jewsbury destroyed all of JWC&#x02019;s but one. Mrs. Ireland&#x02019;s fervid, slackly-dated, expurgated, and rather inaccurate selection is all we have, but remains the only known, substantial, continuous group of letters to JWC apart from those by TC.</note></p>

<salute>Dearest little Goody,</salute>
<p>Your two Letters both reached me; the last only few minutes before the time of departure; both, especially the first, were a great consolation and entertainment to me. I have this moment enclosed Emerson&#x02019;s Letter in a <hi rend="italic">Twopenny</hi> cover for Fraser (your cover was <hi rend="italic">over-weight</hi>), and directed James to send off the missing sheets as soon as possible: I do not suppose any great benefit will ever come to us from that New-England reprint, especially as there is already a robber in the field;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The sheets of <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi>, sent <date when="1841-02">early Feb.</date> (see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410221-TC-LEM-01">TC to <sic>LE</sic><corr>LEM</corr>, <date when="1841-02-21">21 Feb.</date></ref>), had gone astray and the work had been pirated by D. Appleton, the New York publisher.</note> but we must do the best we can for it, the rather as that is so easily done.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-104" n="13:104"/>
Richard and I rolled off from the door of Fryston Hall, in a handsome enough manner, yesterday about eleven o&#x02019;clock. He was bound to Barnsley-dale, on visit to the &#x0201C;Dragon of Wantley&#x0201D;; the Galways also were to return homewards in an hour: so that we left a vacant house,&#x02014;to a quietude which, I should think, must have been welcome to it! I never lived before in such an element of much ado about <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> nothing: life occupied altogether in getting itself lived! Troops of flunkies bustling and becking at all turns; the meat-jack creaking and playing all day, and I think all night (for I used to hear it very early under my room), and such champagning, clareting and witty-conversation-ing; <foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott</hi></foreign>, I could sooner be a ditcher than spend <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my days so! However, we got rather tolerably thro&#x02019; it,&#x02014;for these ten days; and I really think I can report a favourable change in my inner man, in spite of every drawback. I have not yet made out one good sleep: this morning I had a fair chance; had fallen asleep <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, and was afar in sweet oblivion apparently for hours,&#x02014;when the visage of a flunky at the foot of my bed roused me in <foreign><hi rend="italic">sursaut</hi></foreign> [with a start]: &#x0201C;What o&#x02019;clock?&#x0201D;&#x02014;&#x0201C;&#x02019;Af pas&#x02019; seven, Sir!&#x0201D;&#x02014;&#x0201C;When is breakfast?&#x0201D;&#x02014;&#x0201C;&#x02019;Af pas&#x02019; eight!&#x0201D;&#x02014; Flunky of the Devil! I rose as <hi rend="italic">slowly</hi> as I possibly could; smoked, read newspapers &#x00026;c &#x00026;c you may judge with what felicity, till <hi rend="italic">ten</hi>, when breakfast did arrive! No wealth should in any case induce me to be concerned with retinues of flunkies;&#x02014;and yet poor fellows! Even this flunky of the Devil is a very assiduous helpful creature: I will tell him not to call me tomorrow at all, and so forgive him. I gave our Fryston valet half a sovereign, five shillings to the housemaid, half a crown to the groom,&#x02014;small by degrees, and beautifully less,&#x02014;and so parted at peace with all men. Milnes and the Galways expect me down in Nottinghamshire (expect me, tho&#x02019; with doubts manifold); indeed Richard seemed almost to know that he was to be disappointed! I do not now think there is much chance. The Lady Galway proved, as I feared, a cistern rather than a fountain: of eight o&#x02019;clock dinners and aristocrat shoulderknots there has been, for the present, enough. L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Galway himself I found to be a fine hearty wellbred hunter, not without shrewdness, fun and good-nature: next to Richard he, I think, suited me fully best. I will write to his Lady G. a promise to come and fox-hunt for a week some <hi rend="italic">other</hi> time?&#x02014;</p>
<p>Here at Headingley I feel my situation decidedly improved. The house is very greatly quieter; the people have, almost all, decidedly more sense: two altogether important elements! Besides we dine at <hi rend="italic">six</hi>,&#x02014;nay we have a smoking-room; the youngest brother Arthur<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Marshall (<date when="1814">1814</date>&#x02013;<date when="1898">98</date>), who also worked in the family firm.</note> has <pb id="pg-13-105" n="13:105"/>cigars and pipes!

<salute>Dear good Wife,</salute>
<p>You are much suprised to find me dating out of Annandale; nor have I time to explain what incident and chain of incidents it was that bowled me hitherward yesterday forenoon out of Leeds, rather than Londonward, or some other ward: suffice it to say the Marshalls could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be made to conceive that my original proposal to stay &#x0201C;till Monday&#x0201D; was other than irrevocable; nor would they give the slightest hint of invitation to continue longer,&#x02014;otherwise I should have accepted! As it was, I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to get in motion; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> towards Nottinghamshire,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To the Galways at Serlby Hall.</note> where I was not expected till Wednesday; therefore, either towards London or hitherward;&#x02014;and you see how it has gone. Hardly in my Life have I had a more dispirited entirely miserable day (so far as nerves and atrabiliar humour went) than yesterday was with me. I thought of stopping in Manchester; where it was five o&#x02019;clock, and I still dinnerless: but the railway Inn looked squalid, dingy; the Liverpool train was about starting: I rumbled along again. At Liverpool I asked for Chorley;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably John Rutter Chorley (<sic><date when="1807">1807</date>?</sic><corr><date when="1806">1806</date></corr>&#x02013;<date when="1867">67</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5351"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), sec. of the Liverpool-Birmingham Grand Junction Railway; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18341211-TC-UC-01"><sic>9:400&#x02013;1</sic><corr>TC to UC, <date when="1834-12-11">11 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> he was gone home: an omnibus was starting for the steamers; I mounted, partly that I might have privilege to smoke a cigar,&#x02014;the first since morning. The omnibus left me <hi rend="italic">short</hi> of the Steamers, at an Inn where I demanded <hi rend="italic">beefsteak</hi>: the beefsteak proved tough, cold, price 2 shill and 11 pence, and every way horrible,&#x02014;the room all full of scandalous curly-headed Bagmen: I could not think of fronting strangers that night, of passing the hours in such an alien tumult: I called &#x0201C;a car,&#x0201D; and was in the Ox-belly of the Annan Steamer, amid platitude, grease, sea-sickness and the plagues of Egypt! It was a windy night and my mood, such as you know&#x02014;such as the poor Goody <pb id="pg-13-107" n="13:107"/>knows too well: ah me! Nevertheless I had the privilege of being <hi rend="italic">totally let alone</hi>; I passed the day in absolute silence, consuming my own smoke; except that imperfect beef-steak and a little vapid water pretending to be of the fountain, I tasted no living. Strange to say, my sleep was <hi rend="italic">better</hi> last night than any night since I left you; I woke (for the second time) about 8 o&#x02019;clock decidedly a little better. Ben Nelson<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1783">1783</date>&#x02013;<date when="1845">1845</date>); see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210109-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:304</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1821-01-09">9 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381226-TC-JAC-01"><sic>10:249</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1838-12-26">26 Dec. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> got me tea at Annan; and I walked hitherward in the afternoon three hours ago, not at all such a miserable man. Poor Alick provided me with a <hi rend="italic">bacon</hi> dinner, which has done well enough; infinitely better than the champagne ones. From Annan I w<supplied>[rote]</supplied> to Lady Galway, How I had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come. What amazing <supplied>[ex]</supplied>tremes is a man used to in this shuttlecock wor<supplied>[l]</supplied>d,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> racketing one from extreme to extreme!</p>
<p>The sad news is that my Mother seems to be very much out of order in health, and to have lain so these two weeks at Dumfries. I can get no right account of it; but must get off, myself, tomorrow and see. I have written to John about it, whom in the course of the day you will probably see.&#x02014; I took order with Mrs Marshall to have your Letter forwarded. Shall I get one tomorrow morning? <closer><salute>my wife, my ever dear Good Jeannie! Pity me, do not cease to love me! Yours evermore</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We have arrived here,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Jean Aitken&#x02019;s house.</note> Alick and I, about two hours ago, not without difficulty (the Scotsbrig <hi rend="italic">stud</hi> being one of the weakest ever seen, at present); and found our Mother, thank Heaven, decidedly in the way of recovery; growing gradually, slowly but steadily better, as she says, for a week past. She has been up all daytime these two days past; the Doctor (one MacLellan,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Dr. Robert D. MacLellan, graduated M.D., Edinburgh, <date when="1825">1825</date>, the year before John Carlyle.</note> an acquaintance of yours) has now ceased to give her anything, and merely orders a course of bitters, to promote the general strengthening of the stomach. Our poor Mother! She was <pb id="pg-13-108" n="13:108"/>surprised and very glad to see us. She does not look much different from what she was wont. I propose taking her home (where she is very anxious to be) tomorrow in a <foreign>chaise</foreign>. The weather is too cold for a Gig. We have some speculation about getting to Thornhill or Templand<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grace Welsh&#x02019;s home, 1 mi. from Thornhill.</note> tonight; but I fear it will misgo.&#x02014; On the whole, things are better than I expected here.</p>
<p>They have your two <hi rend="italic">Shades</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Silhouettes.</note> which they are very proud of. The likeness is very recogniseable; but the <hi rend="italic">primness</hi> of the upper lip is exaggerated.&#x02014; &#x02014; James Aitken has got a Letter from Mrs. Welsh, about paper-hangings &#x00026;c, today; all is therein reported &#x0201C;well.&#x0201D; You can step down to Jane at Chelsea, and tell her your news of tonight. I write amid bustle enough, and the noise of many voices; I do not send anything to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> by this post. No Letter from her had come to Leeds, I think; at least none was at Ecclefechan this morning. Last night I had a better kind of sleep. &#x02026; We called at the Austins&#x02019; <hi rend="italic">Gill</hi>;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The farm 4&#xBD; mi. NW of Annan where TC&#x02019;s sister Mary (<date when="1808">1808</date>&#x02013;<date when="1888">88</date>) and her husband, James Austin, had moved, <date when="1839-10">Oct. 1839</date>.</note> indeed our Gig lay there (in a state of dilapidation,&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">now</hi> repaired), and the nag was working at the harrows. It is a neat little Farm; comfortable it promises to be in all senses; good houses built or building, a good landlord and factor, &#x00026;c, &#x00026;c.: I do expect the poor Austins will be better there than they have ever before been. Mary had just had a new daughter,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary&#x02019;s fifth da.</note> two days ago. &#x02026;</p>
<p>We are now past eight p.m., and there is little hope of Templand tonight! Tomorrow, if we all prosper!&#x02014; Go to my poor Jane, and tell her all this; and also that very soon I will come and tell it all myself.</p>
<p>Mother, Jean, James and Sandy, all at my hand, do expressly salute you. <closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>We accomplished our expedition very happily yesterday: in spite of stopping both at Gill and Ecclefechan, we got here with the sun still shining cheerfully, and our good Mother no way incommoded. Today I do not think such a feat would have been practicable. Our Mother had a good sleep last night, and really looks little below her ordinary way today. We keep her in the house, good fires about her; Isabella assiduously managing all. It is very lucky the business has ended so.&#x02014; My Mother says Jean&#x02019;s waiting on her was &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">won</hi>derfu&#x02019;; I <foreign>wate na</foreign> [know not] when I&#x02019;ll get her paid, poor thing!&#x0201D;</p>
<p>It seems in the hurry yesterday a certain &#x0201C;union-dress&#x0201D; (a woollen <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> case) was forgotten, and also a drugget gown.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A union dress is an undergarment, drugget a coarse woollen material.</note> You can send them when James sends the Book of Martyrs.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Popular title of John Foxe, <hi rend="italic">Actes and Monuments of These Latter and Perilous Dayes Touching Matters of the Church</hi> (Latin <date when="1559">1559</date>. English <date when="1563">1563</date>).</note></p>
<p>Mary yesterday was as brisk as ever. They had <hi rend="italic">never yet</hi> got your Letter; which your Goodman himself left in the Postman&#x02019;s quarters! You should mark on the back of them the day of the week and month; that might be a kind of check.</p>
<p>I have had some sleep, but am terribly churned to pieces. Nothing is so good for me as to sit here, and do and even say as nearly as possible <hi rend="italic">Nothing</hi>.&#x02014; A Letter from Jane this morning reports all to be well. I have not been down at Jenny&#x02019;s yet; but must try perhaps to walk so far this evening.</p>
<p>Jamie&#x02019;s Boy ought to be waiting down stairs before now! Our Mother is in bed; courting sleep, by a gentle perusal of one of my Books. Good day, dear Sister. I hear some talk of Glen Stewart house (near Mary, near the Gill &#x00026; Kinmont) for our summer residence;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Glen Stewart was 5 mi. NW of Annan, and Kinmont House 4 mi. WNW; both belonged to the Marquess of Queensberry.

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>John is writing to you upstairs. You must certainly have got two letters from me by this time, and so, I merely take up this bad pen to &#x0201C;let you know I am in being,&#x0201D; and heartily glad to hear good accounts of your mother&#x02014;if not the best of your poor self. A letter from <hi rend="italic">my</hi> mother had told me before John came that she was much better&#x02014;God bless me! if you walked into Templand without note of preparation &#x0201C;how dreadful would be the result&#x0201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably in imitation of Mrs. Welsh&#x02019;s way of speaking.</note> for my <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi> evidently writing in the idea of your being <hi rend="small-caps">here</hi> and the sudden apparition of you <hi rend="italic">there</hi> would surely throw her into fits!&#x02014; My dear Good, I do not like to say make haste to come back&#x02014;for I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> get along tolerably without you <hi rend="italic">for a time</hi>&#x02014;and you hate this poor place so much! but still&#x02014;I fancy that this knocking about Annandale is not the sort of thing to make you stronger, and that after all that you would mend just as fast in London&#x02014;bad as it is&#x02014;beside <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x02014;</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Welsh,</salute>
<p>The morning before yesterday I had very nearly surprised you; more than I believe this Note will now, for Jeannie has most probably apprised you that I am here.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, very suddenly, almost contrary to <hi rend="italic">expectation</hi>, I found myself flung out at Annan-foot once more on my native soil. I had come from Leeds, thro&#x02019; Manchester and Liverpool, literally as driven by the Devil,&#x02014;the <hi rend="italic">Steam</hi>-Devil, at least; or, as Jane expresses it, &#x0201C;like one shot out of a cannon.&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410422-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1841-04-22">22 April</date>]</ref>.</note> At Scotsbrig I found alarming news that my Mother had been seriously unwell at Dumfries for ten days. On the morrow morning, with such inadequate conveyance as could be had here, I was off to Dumfries; found my Mother considerably recovered, and very anxious to be home at her own hearth. Part of my plan was to drive up to Templand, next morning, pass the day there, and return with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to Scotsbrig, in some <foreign>chaise</foreign> or close vehicle, on the day following. It turned on small chances that I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come,&#x02014;that I was not off with the early sun, and there perhaps before the coffee <pb id="pg-13-114" n="13:114"/>was boiled! But they persuaded me to wait breakfast at Dumfries; and the day, after that, broke out so beautiful and mild, that my Mother, greatly averse to <foreign>chaises</foreign>, declared herself eager to venture in such weather if I would take her in the old slow-going gig. You see the result!</p>
<p>We are terribly off for <hi rend="italic">cavalry</hi> here at this season; all horses at work,&#x02014;worn out, even when they <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be spared. Nevertheless I do not yet give you up. I am still to be here for a day or two; and if &#x0201C;Austin&#x02019;s nag&#x0201D; (almost our sole resource) prove attainable, and this dull headache which is daily departing go its ways,&#x02014;who knows?&#x02014; I have written to the Newcastle steam people; partly meaning to return that way: if so, I must depend on <hi rend="italic">their</hi> day, which is not yet known to me. On the whole, it is uncertain;&#x02014;on the whole you must not look for me till you see me! I will do what I can. Nobody will look the blither on me (not even <hi rend="italic">I</hi> myself) if I return without seeing you again!</p>
<p>Jeannie&#x02019;s Letters of which I had <hi rend="italic">two</hi> yesterday (one that had gone round by Leeds) are brisk and of cheery temper; I hope all is going tolerably right, poor little thing. She has been far better this winter than in any other for several years back.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Accept these hasty salutations, my dear Mrs Welsh, from</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>I send you the Dame&#x02019;s Leeds Letter, which will amuse you.&#x02014; If I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> come I will write again. About Tuesday or Wednesday Evg is the likeliest.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Welsh replied, on <date when="1841-04-26">26 April</date>: &#x0201C;I am just favoured with your letter&#x02014; I see your perplexity, and so write immediately to still your unsettled mind. You know, I think, how glad I would have been to see you, and how sorry I shall be in not seeing you&#x02014;and too, when almost with in sight of me. Yet I see your many straits, and inconveniences besides, the shortness of time &#x00026; the unfavourable weather so that I believe it would be more pain than pleasure to both of us, to get only a <foreign>heaff</foreign> of you at so dear a rate.&#x0201D; She then went on to say that her niece and nephew, Margaret and Walter Welsh, were sailing from Liverpool and due to arrive at Annan on <date when="1841-04-30">Fri., 30 April</date>, and to suggest that TC meet her at Dumfries when she went to meet them.</note></p>
<p>But ah! here is rain again: I fear, I fear&#x02014;</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Accept my salutations out of my Mother&#x02019;s cottage in poor old native Annandale! They will reach you on the other side of the Cumberland Mountains, in a scene differing from this as green Earth does from Hades,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; this too is Earth, were not I too <hi rend="italic">spectrish</hi> at present! I found my Mother taken suddenly unwell at a Daughter&#x02019;s house, some twenty miles off this; and had to hasten thitherward without halt. That is the reason of my delay in writing to you. Happily all is now right again; and we are here in safety, met one other time under this Sun.</p>
<p>The moors are silent as death,&#x02014;a strange unwonted blessing to me. The sun shines with a kind of metallic brightness, beautifying even moors and simple furrow fields. Specks of snow still chequer the blue of Skiddaw and Helvellyn,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mountains in Cumbria.</note> my noble friends. Ah me! these brooks still gush along as they did thirty years ago, as they did three thousand years ago; and with me in that period, in that <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> period especially, so much has altered! I study to live silent, as the moors themselves; and feel, as I always do here, extremely like a Ghost,&#x02014;which indeed I am, and you are.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 264&#x02013;65.</note> Yet outside these windows, larks are singing, far up over their earth-nests: we are <hi rend="italic">alive</hi> withal, as I understand it. O Puseyisms, Shovelhat-isms,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Church of England clericalism, so called from the shape of certain clerical hats.</note> and all <hi rend="italic">Isms</hi> that are or were, hold <hi rend="italic">your</hi> foolish scraggy jaw;&#x02014;all the jargon <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can utter, is it not like a kind of personal insult in the presence of that entirely unutterable Fact!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Dear Milnes, I beg you to continue to have some regard for me. Enclosed is the small money-debt converted into gold; the debt of thankfulness I owe will not be soon paid. You are, upon the whole, a good man,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; with terrible perversities.</p>
<p>I shall be proud if Lady Galway and her Husband will remember me at all. I desire you to offer my best regards to your good Mother, to your Aunts and your Father. Fryston shall be memorable to me; Fryston and the inhabitants there. You too, you rogue, in spite of all you pretend, have you not a certain faintly perceptible but undeniable degree of kindness for me!</p>
<p>In not many days I hope to see you again in Pall Mall.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Stanley,</salute>
<p>Your pretty little Note finds me here, far off in rude Annandale regions,&#x02014;&#x0201C;impossible&#x0201D; stamped evidently on the face of it! How strange that little bit of paper looks to me in this environment. There is &#x0201C;Grosvenor Crescent&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Stanleys&#x02019; London address.</note> and the fair signature of a &#x0201C;Henrietta Maria&#x0201D;;&#x02014;in the middle of wet spring tempests, wild moorland solitudes, and the earliest facts of my existence. The Cumberland Mountains, when the clouds leave them, stand blue and beautiful, the Solway sea-water glitters, ever as of old: it is all the old Earth, and the Son of it is such a changed one! &#x0201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Allah akbar</hi></foreign>,&#x0201D; as our friend Mahomet says, &#x0201C;God <hi rend="italic">is</hi> great.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>I have been with Richard Milnes in Yorkshire:&#x02014;he is a good little fellow, in spite of all they say or sing. I have been in Leeds; was tumbled along, thro&#x02019; Manchester, Liverpool, hitherward, thro&#x02019; the volcanic Cotton-land, a true <foreign><hi rend="italic">Terra di Lavoro</hi></foreign>;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Literally land of labor; the name given to the fertile and densely populated volcanic plain N of Naples in the Campania region.</note> in wondrous humour, tied to the tail of their demon Steam-horse;&#x02014;entirely a wondrous business!

<salute>Best Wifekin,</salute>
<p>Here is another pretty little epistle<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of [<date when="1841-04-24">24? April</date>].</note> from thee, inclosed safe in Jack&#x02019;s with various little snips and fragments; altogether interesting to me in this wilderness! <hi rend="italic">She</hi> beats us all for a smart cheery word, once put the pen in her hand. It is a real charity, such a pennyworth, in these tempestuous solitary days.</p>
<p>Pray know, and tell Jack whom I do not write to till at soonest tomorrow, <pb id="pg-13-117" n="13:117"/>That my Mother continues to go on very tolerably, and seems to have nothing but the natural weakness produced by such a disorder left now to struggle with. She keeps her bed today, having taken some slight medicine, but is not otherwise ill: indeed the bed in such wild weather is by no means the worst place for her. I believe, tho&#x02019; she asserts the contrary, that the crowding of us all about her yesterday, as is the wont on Sundays, has done her mischief; that perhaps <hi rend="italic">my</hi> absence in a few days will be as beneficial as my presence.</p>
<p>I have written to your Mother: it was perhaps well, as you say, that we did not flurry her nerves. I did not hold out much prospect of my getting up in person now; but did not cut off hope either;&#x02014;wrote kindly, and said I should at least write again.</p>
<p>This morning Stewart had a woman messenger down at me, thro&#x02019; the rain; with the Letter which I inclose. The dinner of course was a devout imagination; as to the House of Glen I acquiesced likewise in his hint;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Stewart of Gillenbie Rig had suggested they rent Glen Stewart House.</note> and undertook, if the weather brightened a little, to go and <hi rend="italic">look</hi> at the house, to <hi rend="italic">ask</hi> the man about his furniture, and then to await what he, Stewart, would say,&#x02014;addressed to Chelsea. We are not to meet now, on this occasion.</p>
<p>As to my health and sleep, it is veritably not a little improved. I am convinced I should grow considerably better than ever,&#x02014;and perhaps also write better Books!&#x02014;had I a fair chance under the impartial sky of our general Mother Earth somewhere! &#x0201C;Let me see,&#x0201D; as the blind man said.</p>
<p>The Newcastle Steamers sail, it appears, every Wednesday and Saturday. They are slightly the cheapest conveyance. But if the weather continue as surly, one will be better off the sea, I think. As before, we shall <hi rend="italic">see</hi>. It seems as if Saturday first might be a reasonable day for quitting: but hitherto I can <hi rend="italic">fix</hi> nothing. I will keep the date &#x0201C;about a week hence&#x0201D; in my eye. The <date when="1841-05">May</date> of London, I suppose, will be already too hot for me! In <date when="1841-06">June</date> I must get out of it somewhither; fly for life and sanity. A sad case;&#x02014;but Patience, Peace!</p>
<p>Jamie has no certain news yet about the Farm; but we consider it much likeliest that <hi rend="italic">another</hi> has got it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tant pis,&#x02014;tant mieux</hi></foreign> [So much the worse&#x02014;so much the better]?</p>
<p>O my dear, wilt thou be good to me when I return? Art thou getting thy little self made <hi rend="italic">better</hi>. Jack reports great things of the &#x0201C;Earthquake&#x0201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The house cleaning at Cheyne Row.</note>&#x02014; Here is Isabella with a too early dinner <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Good be with thee ever!</salute></closer></p>

<dateline><place>Scotsbrig</place>, Thursday, <date when="1841-04-29">29 April, 1841</date>&#x02014;</dateline>
<salute>Best Goody,</salute>
<p>I have just written to your Uncle Robert;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh (<date when="1786">1786</date>?&#x02013;<date when="1841">1841</date>), JWC&#x02019;s paternal uncle, the fourth Welsh brother, a solicitor; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201014-JBW-EA-01"><sic>1:280</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1820-10-14">14 Oct. 1820</date></corr></ref>. He d., <date when="1841-04-28">28 April</date>, at his home, 60 Northumberland St., Edinburgh.</note> I will now write a word to you, tho&#x02019; in no great case for it, being in much bustle &#x00026;c, and with only a fraction of time left.</p>
<p>Your Letter was handed to Jamie and me yesterday, as we drove thro&#x02019; Ecclefechan, on way to the Gill and Glen Stewart; on one of the beautifullest days ever seen, by far the beautifullest I have yet seen here. Down the Hoddam Road I read you. Hoddam Brig, with the rooks cawing and the river rushing, one of the finest spots in Scotland, not unknown to poor Goody either: this, and earliest and some later recollections, had come in view as I ended. <foreign>Ay de mi!</foreign></p>
    <p>We found Austindom; then the Glen House,&#x02014;one of the stillest strangest-looking places my eyes ever saw. It stands not two gunshots from the Dumfries Highway in middle of a populous country; and yet La Trappe<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Soligny-la-Trappe, NW France, NE of Alen&#xe7;on, site of the monastery of the Trappist order.</note> could hardly be more secluded. A clear-gushing simple Annandale <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> has hollowed out a little dell for itself; just as all Annandale burns do; but here some mortal of the house of Douglas has planted beeches, firs, junipers; built impassable stone-fences, and the strangest Fantasticality of a many-cornered, many-winged two-storey Mansion or Cottage, shut out from the profane eyes of all men! Walks serpentise thro&#x02019; the woods, all round, especially rearward towards Kinmont House and Marquisdom;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kinmount was the Marquess of Queensberry&#x02019;s seat, 4 mi. WNW of Annan. Douglas was the Queensberry family name.</note> the brook gushes, the trees musically <hi rend="italic">sough</hi>, and many linnets and sparrows do their best to sing; a moss-house perched on one height, and alas a green <hi rend="italic">hydrastisy</hi> with steps cut to it on another: this with the Fantasticality of a Mansion or Cottage, desert now as Hades or nearly so, is Glen Stewart. O Heaven, why cannot I anywhere on this Planet get some such sheltered little <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gill</hi></foreign>, with a reasonable commonplace of a Cottage built in it,&#x02014;that I might live there in some degree of sanity, not habitually half mad or rather more so!&#x02014; Arrived in front of the Mansion (Austin and Jamie were with me), the motionless <foreign><hi rend="italic">mutch</hi></foreign> [night-cap] of an old woman became visible thro&#x02019; one of the windows; so motionless that I thought it was a <foreign>mutch</foreign> hung on some stick to rest itself: but no, an old woman, <pb id="pg-13-119" n="13:119"/>to our knocking, stirred under it; hobbled out on a crutch, blind of one eye, all but utterly deaf in both ears, yet <foreign>gleg</foreign> [quick] as a hawk in the inner chambers of her intelligence,&#x02014;a most fantastic wreck of an old woman in the middle of this Fantasm: I did not till <hi rend="italic">now</hi> bethink me that it was one of Tieck&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Tales</hi> (that of the <hi rend="italic">Parrot and Old Woman</hi>)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably J. L. Tieck&#x02019;s &#x0201C;Der blonde Eckbert,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Phantasus</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1812">1812</date>) 165&#x02013;93, trans. by TC as &#x0201C;The Fair-haired Eckbert,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 21:269&#x02013;87.</note> that she put me obscurely in mind of there!&#x02014; We were admitted, and saw the place: alas, I fear it will do nothing for us. It has four rooms of no extraordinary dimensions, and perhaps some fifteen or twenty closets; a labyrinth of nicknacks,&#x02014;wholly a Cockney Fantasticality put down there in Cummertrees:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The parish in Annandale containing Glen Stewart House.</note> it ought to pay a great rent from some foolish Cockney, and to me such a House as the Craigenputtoch one would very literally be far more useful, agreeable, valuable! I have said nothing yet; but do apprehend this will be the issue. I must look elsewhere. My appetite, almost passion, for the country grows by what it feeds on:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 1.2.</note> <hi rend="italic">travelling</hi>, too, I may have made out, does not suit me at all. Heaven guide me to what is wise, not foolish! I return to London, <foreign><hi rend="italic">qua</hi></foreign> London, as towards sulphurous penal fire. My soul is sore here, but it is not mad; I feel health of all kinds returning to me fast, could I but get staid here.</p>
<p>Yesterday I should have been at Templand; the weather having partly dried, that was my intention; but the night before, came this Letter from your Mother.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1841-04-26">26 April</date>.</note> I wrote straightway to say that I would conform. On the whole she is, as usual, &#x0201C;with the best intentions <hi rend="italic">un</hi>fortunate.&#x0201D; The meeting at Annan seems far easier: but it involves me, owing to the hours and dates of the Steamers, in the ugliest complexity; and I fear has thrown Newcastle altogether over the lists for the present! I mean to try still to be off towards Liverpool on Saturday by the Annan Steamer: if I rush right on, you may see me on Sunday! I think, rushing right on, might perhaps be my best plan: we shall see. I am not unhappy; on the contrary I am very composed, and in a state rather pleasant for me,&#x02014;but in which speech of any kind, except commonplace to friendly ears, were a positive nuisance to me. I must write to you again tomorrow, were it but one word,&#x02014; Nay, hang it, I suppose there is no writing tomorrow, for the Sunday post! Well: it is possible I may come on Sunday morning; but it is likelier on Monday: if you do not see me on Monday, expect a letter: that is all I can say.</p>
<p>My poor Goody! Ah me, I wish I were happier, healthier that is, <pb id="pg-13-120" n="13:120"/>for thy sake still more than for my own. One must take thought, one must hold his peace, and <hi rend="italic">do</hi>. Why should we despair of anything <hi rend="italic">now?</hi> Surely the worst and unmanageablest of our days seem past!&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; I continue to sleep from 8 to 9 hours.

<ps><p>Jamie has guessed or as good as known, since Thursday gone a week, that he was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to get the Farm, and has said nothing, till I spoke to him yesterday by accident! I continue to like Jamie; a piece of right unadulterated Annandalism!</p></ps>

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>Arrived here, in a fresh bright morning, with horse and <hi rend="italic">clatch</hi> all roadworthy, I am met by <hi rend="italic">this</hi> epistle!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had replied immediately to Mrs. Welsh&#x02019;s letter of <date when="1841-04-26">26 April</date> agreeing with her suggestion for a meeting in Dumfries (see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410424-TC-GW-01">TC to GW, <date when="1841-04-24">27 [24] April</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410429-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1841-04-29">29 April</date></ref>), but apparently saying that Annan would be more convenient for him. In her reply, &#x0201C;Thursday,&#x0201D; [<date when="1841-04-29">29 April</date>], she said: &#x0201C;I have this instant <hi rend="italic">yours</hi> and have only a moment to catch the first post&#x02014;nothing but vexation of spirit betwixt the Liverpool letters and mine they have done nothing but cross each other in the way so that there was no time to make anything like advance arrangement. They write me they sail at four in the afternoon&#x02014;expect to be at Annan early&#x02014;and in time for the coach to Thornhill from Dumfries&#x02014; again that they are delighted at the prospect of my meeting them with a Thornhill chaise at Dumfries&#x02014;so there I am and I can not for the life of me step out of Dumfries. I do so much regret it&#x02014;but there is no help.&#x0201D;</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Que faire</hi></foreign> [What to do]?&#x02014; The Postmaster, being asked, assures me that a letter will get to London tomorrow at <hi rend="italic">two O&#x02019;clock</hi>. Pray Heaven he be right, and that our assiduous <hi rend="italic">Twopenny</hi> deliver this before bedtime on Saturday night. It will at least explain to poor Goody what mischance has come athwart us; and that, on the whole, I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be expected on &#x0201C;Sunday or Monday.&#x0201D;&#x02014; So far as the dim circumstances will allow me to decide at this moment, I meditate driving on to Thornhill tomorrow with Jamie; returning on Sunday; getting thro&#x02019; perhaps, to Newcastle on Tuesday, seeing poor Harriet,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Martineau.</note> and embarking by the Steamer next day. But I shall have time to write again, before the thing be completed. I wish to Heaven, I had the wearisome confusion of a journey over, and were home again beside my dear Goodie!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-123" n="13:123"/>
All continues well here. The weather has grown bright: I had the most glorious of moonshine walks yesternight, escorted by <hi rend="italic">Hesperus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mars</hi> with a few other Stars, and the old outline of Burnswark and the Annandale Hills lying clear, earnest, almost preternatural-looking, against the Northern Sky. My Goody, my dear Wife! O what an existence is mine!&#x02014;</p>
<p>There is another &#x0201C;Country-house,&#x0201D; it seems, of perhaps a more promising sort, extant on Kirtle-side, Nether Auldby by name: I will go and look at it too since there is time this afternoon. <closer><salute>Thousand <foreign>adieus</foreign>!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear <foreign>Bairn</foreign>,</salute>
<p>I can hear nothing from thee in these days; nothing till I hear it from thy own mouth,&#x02014;hearing and seeing, and much else, all at once! It is my own blame and Fortune&#x02019;s; it is my own sorrow and no other&#x02019;s.</p>
<p>Jamie and I made out Templand on Saturday, as prophesied; we drove, in the beautifullest Mayday sun, thro&#x02019; the Hills of &#xc6; water, silent, clear, with small groups of peasants planting potatoes in the hollows of them;&#x02014;we arrived, not unlooked for, not unwelcome, about 5 in the evening. All is as before, in those Nithsdale spaces: one finds it strange to come upon them after absence and oblivion; <hi rend="italic">they</hi> have not been dead or sleeping tho&#x02019; forgotten; <hi rend="italic">they</hi> still exist there, and are green with the new Spring! I saw old Mundell<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Robert Mundell of Closeburn (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390805-TC-TA-01"><sic>11:164</sic><corr>TC to TA, <date when="1839-08-05">5 Aug. 1839</date></corr></ref>), author of <hi rend="italic">An Abridgement of Roman Antiquities, Proper Names, and Geography</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1820">1820</date>).</note> in the distance, very clean and stiff-looking; poking about his Garden in the Saturday afternoon. Little Bennett<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Bennett (<date when="1794">1794</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872">1872</date>), previously tutor to the Menteaths, had been minister at Closeburn since <date when="1830">1830</date>.</note> also appeared on his glebe; a smooth soft oilbag, basking in Heaven&#x02019;s ray, at the end of an enlarged Manse he has been getting built. Walter and Maggy were your Mother&#x02019;s only guests; a fine quiet sensible girl, poor Maggy; Walter too is gathering sense,&#x02014; &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">a real fine</hi> <foreign>chiel&#x02019;</foreign>,&#x0201D; Jamie calls him: he is to <hi rend="italic">finish</hi> his trials and get his licence tomorrow.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To preach. Walter (ca. <date when="1799">1799</date>&#x02013;<date when="1879">1879</date>), educ. at Edinburgh Univ., minister of Auchtertool, Fife, <date when="1843">1843</date>&#x02013;<date when="1879">79</date>.</note> Your Mother looked well, tho&#x02019; somewhat of a flurry was perceptible. All right: she, Templand House, the garden, and all the rest of it, fit to be put in bandboxes, so perfect was their state of <pb id="pg-13-124" n="13:124"/>order. I am very glad I went up. I had to talk all evening till late; and again all morning, after imperfect sleep. I was not improved by my journey; as indeed what journey does improve me?</p>
<p>My dear Jeannie, what a shock would it be to your heart, the news that poor Uncle Robert was already no more! Your Mother had the melancholy message for me: nothing more she could tell me, if not that his decease had been generally anticipated. The letter I wrote for him, had gone off some few hours before he died.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had written to Robert Welsh, <date when="1841-04-29">29 April</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410429-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1841-04-29">29 April</date></ref>. According to the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1841-05-08">8 May</date>, Welsh d. <date when="1841-04-28">28 April</date>.</note> How strange that Postscript now looks,&#x02014;what the people call <foreign><hi rend="italic">fey</hi></foreign> [unnatural, under doom]. Alas, I thought of poor Robert; I thought of my poor Jeannie who has now as it were no kindred; none at all but me&#x02014;who am worth as good as nothing to her! My poor Jeannie, yet thou must cleave to me; I will not forsake thee, such as I am.&#x02014; It is to me also very mournful to reflect on Robert: but <foreign><hi rend="italic">was thut&#x02019;s</hi></foreign> [what&#x02019;s the use of it]? it is all a mournfulness together this sad and solemn, beautiful and awful life of ours.&#x02014;</p>
<p>On Saturday morning I wrote to Miss Martineau, asking if I could see her by &#x0201C;calling&#x0201D; on Tuesday Evening. Contrary to my expectation, but owing most probably to the Posts, there is no answer this morning. If no answer come at all, or none before breakfast tomorrow, it will be impossible for me to manage Newcastle, and I must take the Liverpool Steamer on Wednesday,&#x02014;and see <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> on Thursday! It is a day shorter at both ends; a day later here, and a day sooner in London, than if you go by Newcastle. My Letter to Harriet was one of the kindest: at bottom, alas, what good can I do her; what good can she do me?</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter of Grahame&#x02019;s to me sent very lately, which will in some sort serve as an answer to your <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Newspaper, and the inquiry you made about the Consulship.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The American consulship in Glasgow; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401031-TC-WG-01"><sic>12:309</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1840-10-31">31 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> All up, as you see.&#x02014; If you step down to Jane, she will next tell you what news or rather no-news there are, and also predict about my homecoming. On Thursday or else on Friday I hope I shall see you again.&#x02014; Our Mother goes on very well: she needs a good <hi rend="italic">recipe</hi> for pills, I think: pray write her out one, and send it as soon as you like. She seems to go upon <hi rend="italic">Ol-ricin</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Oleum ricini:</hi> castor oil.</note> chiefly at present, and has certain Dumfries pills, of which the <hi rend="italic">recipe</hi> was stolen the other day by one of the children.&#x02014; Jamie Austin is here today with <foreign><hi rend="italic">stirks</hi></foreign> [steers] which he has been selling to James of Scotsbrig: all is well on his side of the country.&#x02014; The weather is of the clearest, brightest, with a small chill Northwind breathing. The Cumberland Mountains had a coating of white when I went out first, which Helvellyn still retains. The stillness of this region would be a kind of Heaven for me, could I get it enjoyed.

<salute>Dear Jeannie,</salute>
<p>Do but read that poor letter of Harriet&#x02019;s; enough to make one almost cry. Poor Harriet! For it does not arrive here, till <hi rend="italic">today</hi> at noon, when it has become flatly impossible to go.</p>
<p>I am accordingly off for Annan and Liverpool, tomorrow, to embark about 12 o&#x02019;clock. If I get to Liverpool before 11 p. m. I will go and stay at Maryland Street, or at least try to do it; if after 11, I mean to make straight for the railway, and bowl on by the first train. I write a word to your Cousin Alick,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh&#x02019;s son, at Maryland St.</note> to say this, and explain what went <hi rend="italic">before</hi>. If Alick catch me, it will be thursday night; if he do not, we may hope thursday morning,&#x02014;when I get home.</p>
<p>Poor Harriet, she will be sitting waiting me for tea; and it is to no purpose, for behold I do not go!&#x02014; The &#x0201C;laudanum <foreign><hi rend="italic">pro tempore</hi></foreign> [for the time being]&#x0201D; too: I am very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> about her.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Still ill; and evidently taking laudanum.</note></p>
<p>One counter sorrow is a kind of consolation: this day is very wet, and would have made sad travelling to Carlisle, had I gone.</p>
<p>Your Mother sent a gingerbread cake, and a considerable mass of entirely fat bacon. The cake I will bring carefully in the bottom of my portmanteau The bacon I have had <hi rend="italic">tried</hi>, twice over, and found it naught,&#x02014;seemingly a piece of the <hi rend="italic">belly</hi> of some aged femal swine, which the Thornhill huckster had passed off as not bad and worst but superexcellent. I need not get a new box, or grease my clothes for that. I will leave that.</p>
<p>And so then, Thursday, thou little gypsey. I write no more; this is all the needful.</p>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your last Letter found me on the southern border of Yorkshire; whither Richard Milnes had persuaded me with him, for the time they call &#x0201C;Easter Holidays&#x0201D; here. I was to shake off the remnants of an ugly <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi> which still hung about me; my little portmanteau, unexpectedly driven in again by perverse accidents, had stood packed, its cowardly owner, the worst of all travellers, standing dubious the while, for two weeks or more; Milnes offering to take me as under his cloak, I went with Milnes. The mild, cordial, tho&#x02019; somewhat dilettante nature of the man distinguishes him for me among men, as men go. For ten days I rode or sauntered among Yorkshire fields and knolls; the sight of the young Spring, new to me these seven years, was beautiful, or better than beauty. Solitude itself, the great Silence of the Earth was as balm to this weary sick heart of mine; not Dragons of Wantley (so they call Lord Wharncliff, the wooden Tory man), not babbling itinerant Barrister people, fox-hunting Aristocracy, nor Yeomanry Captains cultivating milk-white moustachios, nor the perpetual racket, and &#x0201C;dinner at 8 o&#x02019;clock,&#x0201D; could altogether countervail the fact that green Earth was around one and unadulterated Sky overhead, and the voice of waters and birds,&#x02014;not the foolish speech of Cockneys at <hi rend="italic">all</hi> times!&#x02014; On the last morning as Richard and I drove off towards the Railway, your Letter came in, just in time; and Richard, who loves you well, hearing from whom it was, asked with such an air to see it that I could not refuse him. We parted at the &#x0201C;station,&#x0201D; flying each his several way on the wings of Steam; and have not yet met again. I went over to Leeds, staid two days with its steeple-chimnies and smoke-volcano still in view; then hurried over to native Annandale, to see my aged excellent Mother yet again in this world while she is spared to me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x02019;s visit to Yorkshire, see his letters <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410407-TC-JWC-01"><date when="1841-04-07">7</date></ref>&#x02013;<ref target="volume-13/lt-18410418-TC-JWC-01"><date when="1841-04-18">18 April</date></ref>.</note> My birthland is always as the Cave of Trophonious<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial: all those who consulted Trophonius as an oracle, buried in a cave in Boetia, emerged melancholy and pale.

It is not yet eight-and-forty hours since I got back; your Letter is among the first I answer, even with a line; your new Book<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>.</note>&#x02014; But we will not yet speak of that.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-128" n="13:128"/>For first I have to say that from Leeds without any loitering I wrote Fraser about the defective &#x0201C;first six sheets&#x0201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <hi rend="italic">Heroes;</hi> see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410418-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1841-04-18">17 [18] April</date></ref>.</note> by whom, as I learned shortly after, they were straightway made up in the due post-office figure; despatched to Liverpool, and there &#x0201C;shipped in the <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> for Boston on the <date when="1841-04-22"><hi rend="italic">22d</hi> of April</date>&#x0201D;;&#x02014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">quod bonum sit</hi></foreign> [may it turn out well].<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18151211-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:67</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1815-12-11">11 Dec. 1815</date></corr></ref>.</note> I cannot conjecture what has become of the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> set; for they, and all the sheets of the Book were duly sent off, in swift succession, by conveyances which fair judges reckoned safe. Probably <hi rend="italic">they</hi> have now arrived, before Fraser&#x02019;s? If they have not, if Fraser&#x02019;s too have not, and there is still somewhat wanting,&#x02014;then let it and them wander forever and ever in the Ocean brine, let the New York pirate work his will, and my brave Emerson free himself from such sorry trouble; for which I would again apologise, were not apologies a new trouble to him! Nay, probably he feels it a luxury to help in any way his brother over here; in which case why should I grudge it him? Is not the man worthy to help,&#x02014;one of these rare men that <hi rend="italic">are</hi> worthy?&#x02014; As for the antecedent Bookseller&#x02019;s Account, to me dim as hieroglyphics, James Fraser did look it over, with his sharp trade-eyes; declared it, if I remember, to be all correct according to bibliopolic tables of the Law,&#x02014;except (now I bethink me) that of one Book (I no longer know, or almost never knew, which Book) there were more copies marked printed than were accounted for as either sold or unsold in the statement,&#x02014;an error which your man will by and by rectify of himself; or else we will denounce it, specify it with details!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had said, <date when="1841-02-28">28 Feb.</date>, that he was enclosing the accounts of one of TC&#x02019;s American publishers, James Munroe, made out by George Nichols, the clerical partner in the firm: &#x0201C;I have long been that man&#x02019;s victim, semiannually, &#x00026; never dare to make head against his figures. You are a brave man, &#x00026; out of the ring of his enchantments, &#x00026; withal have magicians of your own who can give spell for spell, &#x00026; read his incantations backwards.

<p>My friend, I <hi rend="italic">thank</hi> you for this Volume of yours; not for the copy alone which you send to me, but for writing and printing such a Book. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Euge!</hi></foreign> say I, from afar.

This is the one feat for me, which absorbs all others whatsoever. Persist, persist; you have much to say and to do. Those voices of yours which I liken to <hi rend="italic">un</hi>embodied souls, and censure sometimes for having no body,&#x02014;how <hi rend="italic">can</hi> they have a body? They are light-rays darting upwards in the East; they will yet <hi rend="italic">make</hi> much and much to have a body! You are a new era, my man, in your new huge country: God give you strength, and speaking and silent faculty, to do such a work as seems possible now for you! And if the Devil will be pleased to set all the Popularities <hi rend="italic">against</hi> you and evermore against you,&#x02014;perhaps that is of all things the very kindest any <hi rend="italic">Angel</hi> could do.</p>
<p>Of myself I have nothing good to report. Years of sick idleness and barrenness have grown wearisome to me. I do nothing. I waver and hover, and painfully speculate even now, as to health, and where I shall spend the summer out of London! I am a very poor fellow;&#x02014;but hope to grow better by and by. Then this <hi rend="italic">alluvies</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An anglicized form of alluvium.</note> of foul lazy stuff that has long swum over me may perhaps yield the better harvest. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Esperons</hi></foreign> [Let us hope]!&#x02014; Hail to all of you from both of us.</p>

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Any time these six weeks I have been fully and even eagerly minded to send you a word of remembrance, a word of inquiry; and yet till this moment, in so many weeks all of perfect idleness, it is never done! How the like of this takes place in private history, with a Penny-Post all in action round us, and paper and ink not unattainable,&#x02014;is a phenomenon which I will leave Philosophy to give account <pb id="pg-13-131" n="13:131"/>of. Man was known long ago as a very strange fellow,&#x02014;partaking much of the nature of the Ass.</p>
<p>About the <date when="1841-03">end of March</date>, being greatly broken by Influenza and long imprisonment in Cockneydom, I had decided on a run into the country; but found obstacles seemingly endless tho&#x02019; of small moment; and so was sitting in the melancholy character of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Rusticus expectat</hi></foreign> [the rustic who waits],<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> 1.2.42.</note> when Richard Milnes (everlasting honour to him!) as it were lifted me up, carried me with him to Yorkshire, and set me flying. I returned only on Thursday last from a long gyration, which had included a glance at native Annandale withal; and am seated here in a small upper back-room in the summer twilight at this date; a sadder and alas <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a wiser man!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x0201C;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,&#x0201D; penultimate line.</note> Friend John shall at least know authentically my whereabout; that will be one small duty done.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; My Life threatens all to go to rubbish here, if I do not look to it. The braying uproar of this City is distractive and destructive to me: and yet the question, How to keep what of really valuable I possess in it, and avoid what renders all possession nearly worthless? baffles my best endeavour hitherto. Patience,&#x02014;at lowest Silence, and shuffle the cards!</p>
<p>Varnhagen von Ense,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl August Varnhagen von Ense (<date when="1785">1785</date>&#x02013;<date when="1858">1858</date>), German biographer; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371231-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>9:382</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1837-12-31">31 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> the beneficent munificent man, has sent by way of gift a set of German Books, which I merely inquired the names of: these, such of them as turn upon Luther, I read for the present. Oliver Cromwell lies inaccessible, ever more inaccessible (like a Tower far up among granite chasms), the nearer I get to him&#x02014; By what art or aid of Clio<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Muse of history.</note> can any man ever make a History of <hi rend="italic">him?</hi> Yet he had a history; as great as another&#x02019;s! Only the man to write it will probably never be born.&#x02014; Or leaving History altogether, what do you say of Prophecy? Is not <hi rend="italic">Prophecy</hi> the grand thing? The volcanic <foreign><hi rend="italic">terra di lavoro</hi></foreign> [land of labor] of Yorkshire and Lancashire: within that too lies a prophecy gran<supplied>[der]</supplied> than Ezekiel&#x02019;s;&#x02014;and the &#x0201C;Church of the Future,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">its</hi> dome is the skyey vault; a much finer than St. Peter&#x02019;s or St Paul&#x02019;s dome! In short, the essential point is to know whether you will look before or after, or stand like the Ass between his two bundles, looking at nothing save his own stupidity!&#x02014; And so, having got now into another sheet, I will quit all that embroiled disconsolate concern; leave it partly in the hands of the upper and under Powers.</p>
<p>My Wife has a copy of a little Book which Emerson the American has written for you (for you and me and others), and sent you a copy <pb id="pg-13-132" n="13:132"/>of to her care. I inquired again this evening, Whether it was yet gone? She had offered it to your Father, had duly apprised you of it: but the little volume itself still lies <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. I long somewhat to hear what you will say of it. Not for a long time have I read anything with more <hi rend="italic">profit</hi>. I cannot so much say pleasure as profit: this man, for the veracity of the rude word that is in him, seems to me one of a thousand. I do regard him as the sign of a New Era in Yankee-land. As the last malodorous flicker of expiring lamps is to the first (cold) gleam of morning out of Heaven, so is Puseyism &#x00026;c &#x00026;c to poor Emersonism, cold tho&#x02019; it be&#x02014; Well, you must read that little Book of Essays, and tell me if you do not find a right tone in it here and there</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Election</hi> arrived here during my absence. All the changes I have noticed are improvements;&#x02014;especially the change from dreadful illegible handwriting into clear print, is not that an improvement! Upon the whole there is real worth in the Piece, <hi rend="italic">real</hi> worth you observe;&#x02014;and you will not believe me at all, when I say, and persist in saying, that there is far more of real worth, of real poetry too, in the prose you have written and can write, than there is any clear proof of in this! Well, do not believe me; it would be a dreadful responsibility if you did. It is amazingly difficult to know what to believe in such matters. A man has to read with all his eyes, with the best spectacles and only makes out the truth approximately after all. Curious: there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a work which we here and now could best of all do; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> were the thing of things for us to set about doing. But alas what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> it? A advises one thing, B another thing, C still more resolutely a third thing; the whole Human Species actually or virtually advise all manner of things; and <hi rend="italic">our own</hi> vote, which were the soul of all votes, the <hi rend="italic">word</hi> where all else are hearsays, lies deep-buried, drowned in outer noises, too difficult to come at!&#x02014;</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Sterling; I must not begin another sheet. Today at Milnes&#x02019;s there was due inquiry made for you among the lions, and joy at the prospect of seeing you before long Good be ever with you, my Friend. Forget us not.</salute></closer></p>

<p>There are two Notices of Mantegna&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Triumph of Caesar</hi>, written by Goethe; in the <hi rend="italic">Kunst und Alterthum</hi>, vol IV. No 1. p. 111, and N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> <pb id="pg-13-133" n="13:133"/>2. p. 51 of the same volume.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrea Mantegna (<date when="1431">1431</date>&#x02013;<date when="1506">1506</date>), Italian painter, among whose works are nine tempera pictures representing <hi rend="italic">The Triumph of Caesar</hi> (<date when="1482">1482</date>&#x02013;<date when="1492">92</date>), acquired by Charles I, now at Hampton Court. <hi rend="italic">&#xdc;ber Kunst und Alterthum</hi>, 6 vols. (Stuttgart, <date when="1816">1816</date>&#x02013;<date when="1832">32</date>), ed. Goethe. TC&#x02019;s information about it in the next sentence is slightly mistaken. He wrote with confidence since he owned a copy, inscribed by Goethe (Sotheby&#x02019;s sale, <date when="1932-06-13">13 June 1932</date>).</note> Neither of these that I can find has been admitted into the general Collection of his Works. The <hi rend="italic">Kunst und Alterthum</hi> (Art and Antiquity) is a kind of Periodical which Goethe in his latter years used to publish at irregular intervals; some 4 or 5 N<hi rend="italic">os</hi> of it making a small dumpy volume, of which at his death there were 5 in all. What were judged the best pieces have been reprinted among his Posthumous (<hi rend="italic">Nachgelassene</hi>) Works; but this of Mantegna, as I said, does not appear among these. I remember well enough reading them, a number of years ago. There is much praise given to Mantegna; extracts from Vasari; correspondence with Dr Noehden (at that time, of the British Museum), from whom chiefly Goethe has procured a minute account of the Mantegnas in Hampton Court, and of the English history of them.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Giorgio Vasari (<date when="1511">1511</date>&#x02013;<date when="1574">74</date>), Italian painter, architect, and art historian; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400300-TC-JHLH-01"><sic>12:90</sic><corr>TC to JHLH, <date when="1840-03-30">30 March 1840</date></corr></ref>.

There is even now, as I compute, a better stock of reading laid open than the London Public ever had presented to it in that manner, <pb id="pg-13-134" n="13:134"/>since London first rose out of mud.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Some six weeks ago, while I was just running off into the country, your very welcome and most friendly Letter reached me here. An ugly disorder, which they call <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi>, had altogether lamed me, in the cold weather of Spring; the Doctors, and still more emphatically my own feelings, declared that I could not shake the dregs of it off except in the quiet of the fields. Always, after a certain length of time spent in this enormous never-resting Babel of a city, there rises in one not a wish only but a kind of passion, for uttermost solitude,&#x02014;were it only some black ever-desolate moor, where Nature alone was present, and Manufacture and Noise, speech, witty or stupid, had never reached! I prolonged my Excursion, which at first was only a visit to Yorkshire, into the South of Scotland my native region, where Brothers of mine, where an aged good Mother still live for me. I myself, to all other persons, am now as good as a stranger there. It is a mournful, solemn, nay, almost preternatural place for me now, that birthland of mine; sends me back from it <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, for there are no words to speak the<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> thoughts and the <hi rend="italic">unthinkables</hi> it awakens! Arriving here, ten days ago, your Berlin Books,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably including Gustav Pfizer, <hi rend="italic">Martin Luthers Leben</hi> (Stuttgart, <date when="1836">1836</date>) and Martin Luther, <hi rend="italic">Sinnreiche Tischreden</hi>, 2 vols. (Stuttgart, <date when="1836">1836</date>) (both recorded amongst TC&#x02019;s books in <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x02019;s House</hi> [<date when="1897">1897</date>] 81, 87); see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401107-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>12:316</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1840-11-07">7 Nov. 1840</date></corr></ref>. Also probably Philipp Marheinecke, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der teutschen Reformation;</hi> see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410521-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1841-05-21">21 May</date></ref>. TC had also asked about a life of Frederick the Great.</note> one of the most interesting Gifts, lay all beautifully <pb id="pg-13-135" n="13:135"/>arranged on a table for me; I had heard of their safe arrival in my absence, and here they lay like a congratulation waiting my return.</p>
<p>You forbid me to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> of this altogether extraordinary Gift; accordingly I shall say nothing of it, how much soever I must naturally feel,&#x02014;except that, under penalty of my never <hi rend="italic">asking</hi> you again about any book, you must not <hi rend="italic">purchase</hi> for me any more than these! No; that would never do; for I shall want perhaps to ask about many Books. I will put them on my shelves, having once read them thro&#x02019;; there let them stand as a peculiar thing, a memorial to me of many things.&#x02014; All my days I have laboured and lamented under a fatal lack of Books; as indeed England generally and London itself would astonish you in that particular: think only that in London, except it be the garbage of new Novels and such like, there is no Library whatever from which any man can borrow a Book home with him. One library alone, in our huge <hi rend="italic">empire</hi>, that of the British Museum here, is open to the public, to read <hi rend="italic">in it;</hi> there at first I used to attempt reading, but found that in a room with 500 people I could do no good as a reader. A German, a Frenchman can hardly believe the existence of such a state of things: but it is a lamentable fact. We are a strange people, we English. A people, as I sometimes say, with more <hi rend="italic">in</hi>articulate intelligence and less of articulate than any people the Sun now shines on. Speak to one of us, speak to almost any one of us, you will stand struck silent at the contractedness, perhaps Cimmerian<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like the remote land of darkness and gloom described by Homer.</note> stupidity of the <hi rend="italic">word</hi> he responds; yet look at the <hi rend="italic">action</hi> of the man, at the combined action of 28 millions of such men. After years you begin to see thro&#x02019; their outer <hi rend="italic">dumbness</hi> how these things have been possible for them; how they do verily stand in closest continual communication with many a Power of Nature, clearest insight into that; how perhaps their very dumbness is a kind of force! On the whole I grow to admire less and less your <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi> peoples. The French are a speaking people, and persuade numbers of <hi rend="italic">men</hi> that they are great; but coming to try veracious Nature, the Ocean for example, Canada, Algiers or the like, Nature answers, &#x0201C;No <foreign>Messieurs</foreign>, you are little!&#x0201D; Russia again, is not that a great thing, still speechless? From Petersburg to Kamtchatka, the Earth answers&#x02014;,&#x0201C;Yes&#x0201D; I love the English too, and all the Teutons, for their silence.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi> 10:157&#x02013;58. France had occupied Algiers, <date when="1830">1830</date>, and fought over the rest of Algeria until conquest, <date when="1847">1847</date>. In Canada TC possibly refers to the French failure to retain control of their colonies in the eighteenth cent., but more probably to the revolt of the French Canadians in Lower Canada, <date when="1837">1837</date>. Kamchatka is a peninsula on the Siberian coast of the N Pacific.</note> Th<supplied>[ey]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">can</hi> speak too,&#x02014;by a Shakspeare, by a Goethe, <pb id="pg-13-136" n="13:136"/>when the time comes. So<supplied>[me]</supplied> assiduous whisking &#x0201C;dog of knowledge&#x0201D; seems to itself a far cleverer creature than the great quiet elephant or noble horse;&#x02014;but it is far mistaken!</p>
<p>However, this of the lamentable want of Books in London (owing to that &#x0201C;outer stupidity&#x0201D; of the English) has now brought about some beginning of its own remedy. What I meant to say was, That the generous Varnhagen <hi rend="italic">need</hi> not send me any more Books, because any good Book, German or other has now become attainable here. Some two years ago, after sufficiently lamenting and even sometimes execrating such a state of matters, it struck me, Couldst not thou, even thou there, try to mend it? The result, after much confused difficulty, is a democratic Institution called &#x0201C;London Library,&#x0201D; where all men, on payment of a small annual sum, can now borrow Books; a thing called here &#x0201C;Subscription Library,&#x0201D; which in such a city as London, appetite growing by what it feeds on, may well become by and by one of the best Libraries extant. We are democratic as I said, or rather we <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> to be; for as yet only the elect of the Public could be interested in the scheme. Prince Albert, good youth, is Patron, by his own free offer; has given 50 pounds of money, and promises &#x0201C;a stock of German books.&#x0201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410309-TC-RMM-01">TC to RMM, <date when="1841-03-09">9 March</date></ref>.</note> Varnhagen&#x02019;s are already there. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Faustum sit</hi></foreign> [May it turn out well].</p>
<p>You give an altogether melancholy account of your health; in which, alas, I can too well sympathize! It seems to me often the one misery in this world. But the Supreme Powers send it: we are to work under such condition, we cannot alter that condition. Perhaps there is even much good in it: I often feel so.&#x02014; Your response to the poor Pamphlet <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had sent a copy with his letter of <date when="1840-11-07">7 Nov. 1840</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401107-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>12:316</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1840-11-07">7 Nov. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> is that of a generous human heart, <hi rend="italic">resonant</hi> to all human things, never so remote from it. We are struggling as thro&#x02019; thick darkness, in this England of ours,&#x02014;towards light and deliverance as I do believe. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Sir; better health of body to you, and no worse healthy brotherliness of soul! <closer><salute>With affectionate esteem, Yours always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>After I had determined on writing you a line today, there has arrived a little Note from Alick, which I am heartily glad of. He reports <pb id="pg-13-137" n="13:137"/>that you are still doing well, that you can &#x0201C;come over to sermon&#x0201D; (he does not say whether on your own feet or not,&#x02014;but indeed I hope you do not <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to walk so far), that you are gradually &#x0201C;recruiting&#x0201D;; and that all the rest are in their old state. Such a Note, now that they cost but a penny, would be welcome <hi rend="italic">oftener!</hi>&#x02014; I will persist in writing to <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> I will thank Alick, and write to him another time.</p>
<p>It is precisely a fortnight now, I think, since I wrote last; the day after my return hither. It seems a much longer time to me; for I have had a great many things in my head; have lived almost altogether by myself; and, except one morning when we <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to breakfast with Milnes my Yorkshire landlord and a party of his,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1841-05-13">13 May</date>.</note> I have gone out only once, to meet the good Thomas Erskine, and declined all other <foreign><hi rend="italic">outrakes</hi></foreign> [expeditions] whatsoever. I very rarely even go into London town; the roaring tumult of the streets in this <date when="1841-05">May</date> month rather does me ill to <hi rend="italic">look</hi> upon it; I prefer the lanes and gardens to the westward, where I can get my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> thought followed, and only hear the Babylon from afar. For a good many days I felt rather worse for my journey, and seemed not to be in haste to recover completely,&#x02014;such a sad business is all travelling to me: this week, however, I am fully got round again, and altogether as well as when you saw me. Jane has sorted up for me a pleasant little <hi rend="italic">back</hi> closet, where I sit all morning, refusing to see anybody, even to open a Letter, till &#x0201C;my own work&#x0201D; be over: here I look out over pleasant spaces, gardens, even a field, and many green tall trees, which hide almost all the bricks; all noise too is damped, and I <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> as if I were alone, no neighbour but the great heavenly Summer and its leaves and flowers! I am reading a long German Book about Luther;&#x02014;endeavouring withal to settle a great many <foreign><hi rend="italic">burbled</hi></foreign> [tangled] accounts with my own unworthy Self and its concerns! Would the weather always continue so, my health would do very well, and I could not be better than here. When the heat comes, however, I suppose I must run for it; and the question, Whitherward? is still undetermined.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1841-06-04">4 June</date>: &#x0201C;On the Monday, not meaning it decidedly, I travelled along (most mournfully, uncomfortably) towards Manchester, Liverpool, and the Annan Steamer. On the morrow morning at Annan! Ben Nelson&#x02014;dreary. Walk up to Ecclefechan; in great <hi rend="italic">solitude:</hi> my Brother Alick;&#x02014; Mother not well at Dumfries! Who could describe the mood all these things put me into? To Dumfries on the morrow, and bring my dear Mother home. Stay-beside her, and the rest of them, amid silent unutterabilities, for two weeks; on the <date when="1841-05-05">first [fifth] of May</date>, Brother Jamie down with me to Annan, and again off hither-ward. Coleridge&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Table-talk</hi> with queasiness, all day, in the <date when="--05">middle of May</date> cattle: an unutterable day. Right onwards without ever pausing; home here at one o&#x02019;clock on the morrow: sick (that is <hi rend="italic">sicker</hi>) almost ever since. <foreign>Eheu!</foreign>&#x02014; But, hush, my sickness is more than of body; it is of mind too, and my own blame. I ought to know <hi rend="italic">what I am going to work at:</hi> all lies there!&#x02014; The summer heat does not yet drive me out: but probably soon will. To Glen-Stewart in Annandale? to Wales, to Sussex?&#x02014; or quit London altogether; retire to the neighbourhood of London, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> need to break up one&#x02019;s household once every year? We shall see; ought already to <hi rend="italic">have seen</hi>, but cannot yet. Despicable mortal! Know thy own mind; go then and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it&#x02014;in silence. &#x02026; Lectures published <hi rend="italic">before</hi> I went with Milnes: babble, babble about them; a thing I take <hi rend="italic">no</hi> interest in, a thing I am almost ashamed of. Ought I not never to lecture more?&#x02014; Tasks in Literature are as yet none for me. I have been reading Luther. Cromwell still a task? Is perhaps some articulate task getting itself ready for me! O that it were!&#x02014; Let me cease writing here.&#x0201D;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-138" n="13:138"/>Ben Nelson wrote to me about that &#x0201C;Lodge&#x0201D; house, rent &#xa3;26; but I could not on the spur of the moment answer Yes; I answered, No, therefore and do not yet regret that. James Stewart has also written to me about the Glen Mansion, That the Marquis<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Douglas (<date when="1779">1779</date>&#x02013;<date when="1858">1858</date>), 7th marquess of Queensberry, who owned Glen Stewart.</note> <hi rend="italic">wished</hi> us to come, would have <hi rend="italic">no rent</hi> &#x00026;c, &#x00026;c; all which are comfortable circumstances; yet I doubt whether we should do well under the wing even of the best of Marquises, and have not yet decided. I answered, for the time, that they were to let all stand as it was at Glen Stewart; to accept many handsomest thanks (which so kind a thing merited); and that before the <date when="1841-06">middle of June</date> we would either say Yes or No. Jane is willing to go thither with me, or anywhither. Then, about a week ago, our Welsh Friend,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Redwood (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x02013;<date when="1854">54</date>), solicitor in Cowbridge; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400109-TC-CR-01"><sic>12:13</sic><corr>TC to CR, <date when="1840-01-09">9 Jan. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> he of the <hi rend="italic">leg-of-mutton</hi>, called on us; a brisk, modest, very kind-looking; he was most earnest to have us into his beautiful sea-coast of Wales; so &#x0201C;silent,&#x0201D; so &#x00026;c; and where <hi rend="italic">he</hi> kept an excellent horse and never used it,&#x02014;very much at <hi rend="italic">my</hi> service! Our own nearest sea-coast is about Brighton, only some sixty miles off; which nearness is a great temptation. On the whole we know not what to decide as yet; and often I think of my dear Mother&#x02019;s wish as the only good one: &#x0201C;I wish thou may be guided to choose wisely!&#x0201D; So be it. We ought to be very thankful, meanwhile, that we <hi rend="italic">can</hi> choose. I am not without money enough for present wants: the Americans too have sent me back &#xa3;100 which I ventured on them in the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> matter some two years ago,&#x02014;so that I have now my own money back again at any rate, and they may keep their promise of more if they can. The <hi rend="italic">Lecture</hi> Book has come out there, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> on my account: an impudent Bookseller of New York <hi rend="italic">forestalled</hi> the good Emerson; set it out for his own profit, and even defended the deed, and said he meant to do so with <hi rend="italic">all</hi> works of mine in future. As to the &#x0201C;future,&#x0201D; however, we have a plan for him. This time he does his own way, poor hungry man. Nay Emerson says, They have printed me in a huge <pb id="pg-13-139" n="13:139"/>newspaper at Boston (a sheet almost like a barndoor), and sell me for three-pence! Better so than worse.&#x02014; Poor Fraser cannot give me his accounts at present (which I wanted to have, as one important item in my plans): he is ill of a lingering dangerous sickness, which has made him very weak at present; and I cannot press the poor man.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He d. <date when="1841-10-02">2 Oct.</date></note></p>
<p>Jack dines with us every sabbath: I do not see much of him at other times; he gallops about with his Patient, is here and is there, all in a <foreign><hi rend="italic">flaff</hi></foreign> [flutter], and I daresay rather avoids my grim countenance till he have got himself composed a little! He seems well, and in very good spirits; doing well with his Patient too; only unhappy in being anxious at bottom that he is properly not <hi rend="italic">working</hi>, but mainly idling&#x02014;at very high wages.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201C;&#xa3;1000 a year and more&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s Journal, <date when="1841-01-04">4 Jan.</date>).</note> He was to write to Isabella about her complaint; which he seemed to believe like me to proceed entirely from the stomach. He has got for his Mother the Book on <hi rend="italic">Luther and his Times</hi>,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >[Hannah F. Lee], <hi rend="italic">The Life and Times of Martin Luther</hi> (Bristol, <date when="1840">1840</date>).</note> which will interest her: poor Doil<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Family nickname for John A.

He has sat a second time for his Portrait by a strange machine they have got here, called Daguerrotype,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >New process of photography named after Louis J. M.

Jane tried for one of herself; but it was &#x0201C;horrible&#x0201D; (they do not always succeed, or yet understand the ways of the thing): she will not go back, she says; neither need I go.</p>
<p>All men are <hi rend="italic">lashing</hi> and talking Politics here: Corn-laws, change of Ministry &#x00026;c &#x00026;c.

But, on <date when="1841-05-18">18 May</date>, the govt. was defeated after a debate on sugar duties. There were disagreements within Lord Melbourne&#x02019;s ministry whether to resign or to dissolve parliament and have a general election.

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>About a week ago I wrote to you, after too long a silence. Since that, there has another Letter come,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1841-04-30">30 April</date>.</note> with a Draught of one hundred pounds in it, and other comfortable items not pecuniary; a line in acknowledgement of the money is again very clearly among my duties. Yesterday, on my first expedition up to Town, I gave the Paper to Fraser; who is to present the result to me in the shape of cash tomorrow. Thanks, and again thanks. This &#xa3;100, I think, nearly clears off for me the outlay of the second <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution;</hi> an ill-printed, ill-conditioned publication, the prime cost of which, once all lying saved from the Atlantic whirlpools and hard and fast in my own hand, it was not perhaps well-done to venture thitherward again.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The second American edn. of 500 copies, printed by James Fraser and pbd. by Little &#x00026; Brown (Dyer 87&#x02013;88), had cost TC &#xa3;95; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390824-TC-JFR-01"><sic>11:175</sic><corr>TC to JFR, <date when="1839-08-24">24 Aug. 1839</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390904-TC-RWE-01"><sic>178&#x02013;79</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1839-09-04">4 Sept. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> To the new trouble of my friends withal! We will now let the rest of the game play itself out as it can; and my friends, and my one friend, must not take more trouble than their own kind feelings towards me will reward.</p>
<p>The Books, the <hi rend="italic">Dial</hi> N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 4, and Appleton&#x02019;s pirated <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi>, are still expected from Green.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1841-04-30">30 April</date> Emerson explained that before TC&#x02019;s sheets of <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> had come, Appleton of New York had issued a pirated edn.

He was also sending (by &#x0201C;John Green&#x02019;s, Newgate Street&#x0201D;) a copy of <hi rend="italic">The Dial</hi>, no. 4.</note> In a day or two he will send them: if not, we <pb id="pg-13-141" n="13:141"/>will jog him into wakefulness, and remind him of the <hi rend="italic">Parcels Delivery Company</hi>, which carries luggage of all kinds, like mere letters, many times a day, over all corners of our Babylon. In this, in the universal British <hi rend="italic">Penny Post</hi>, and a thing or two of that sort, men begin to take advantage of their crowded ever-whirling condition in these days, which brings such enormous disadvantages along with it <hi rend="italic">un</hi>sought for.&#x02014; Bibliopolist Appleton does not seem to be a &#x0201C;Hero,&#x0201D;&#x02014;except after his own fashion.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had said that Appleton &#x0201C;told us that he intends to print in future everything of yours that shall be printed in London complaining in rude terms of the monopoly your publishers have exercised &#x00026; the small commissions they allow to the Trade.&#x0201D;</note> He is one of those of whom the Scotch say, &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Thou</hi> wouldst do little for God if the Devil were dead!&#x0201D; The Devil is unhappily dead, in that international bibliopolic province, and little hope of his reviving for some time; whereupon this is what Squire Appleton does. My respects to him: even in the Bedouin department I like to see a complete man, a clear decisive Bedouin.&#x02014; For the rest, there is one man who ought to be apprised that I can now stand robbery a little better; that I am no longer so very poor as I once was. In Fraser himself there do now lie vestiges of money! I feel it a great relief to see, for a year or two at least, the despicable bugbear of Beggary driven out of my sight; for <hi rend="italic">which</hi> small mercy, at any rate, be the Heavens thanked. Fraser himself for these two editions, 1000 copies each, of the <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pays me down on the nail &#xa3;150; consider that miracle! Of the other Books which he is selling on a joint-stock basis, the poor man likewise promises something, tho&#x02019; as yet ever since Newyearsday I cannot learn what, owing to a grievous sickness of his,&#x02014;for which otherwise I cannot but be sorry, poor Fraser within the Cockney limits being really a worthy, accurate and rather friendly creature. So you see me here provided with bread and water, for a season,&#x02014;it is but for a season one needs either water or bread,&#x02014;and rejoice with me accordingly. It is the one useful, nay I will say the one <hi rend="italic">innoxious</hi>, result of all this trumpeting, reviewing, and dinner-invitationing; from which I feel it indispensable to withdraw myself more and more resolutely, and altogether count it as a thing not there. Solitude is what I long and pray for. In the babble of men my own soul goes all to babble: like soil you were forever <hi rend="italic">screening</hi>, tumbling over with shovels and riddles; in <hi rend="italic">which</hi> soil no fruit can grow!

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Today I can do nothing more than send you, in the hastiest manner, an instruction for your Goodman about a little piece of easy business. Yesterday, namely, I sent off, in the old way, addressed to him at the Commercial Bank Dumfries, a sum of a hundred-and-ten pounds; which he is to get me a receipt for, as before, and put beside the other, safe, in his drawer till we hear farther. I think the money will be there ready about Monday;&#x02014;or perhaps they only communicate with Edinburgh once a week; in which case it will be there, on Wednesday. Pray let me have a small notice that the thing is done and right, and then we have it off our hands. A half word will suffice; or even an empty cover <hi rend="italic">addressed</hi> merely! You make a wonderful <foreign><hi rend="italic">scraffle</hi></foreign> [struggle] to write; for which I give you great credit, knowing how busy you are held with all the <foreign>Bairns</foreign> and <foreign>Etceteras</foreign>.</p>
<p>This new &#xa3;100 is from America; a purse of my own which I <hi rend="italic">sank</hi> there, almost two years ago, in the second edition of the F. R.&#x02014;this now once more in my hands, I will let them fight with the rest, and all <pb id="pg-13-144" n="13:144"/>that comes will be clear gain. Booksellers, it appears, are in a confused state there as here, and all trade much out of joint. A considerable knavery, I also doubt, is seldom wanting.</p>
<p>Jane received your Letter, the other day, with the straw plait, and will write for her own behoof. She seemed to think the plait beautiful and not dear,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; the charge of <hi rend="italic">making</hi> adds 7/6 to the bonnet here.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Plaited for JWC by Miss Graham; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401016-TC-JCA-01"><sic>12:290</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1840-10-16">16 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Jack was with us yesterday; brought a present of a walking-stick, which you can spread out, put straps upon, and make into a stool! I have it sitting in the garden under the <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> shadow of our one plumtree upon the &#x0201C;bleaching-green,&#x0201D; to repose upon while smoking. I went out with Jack and his patient, who were bent towards the City and region of <hi rend="italic">banks</hi> (my errand was that Comm. Bank money for James&#x02019;s care); we prosecuted our expedition by rope-railways, steamers and all sorts of conveyances,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC could have gone to the City by steamship as far as London Bridge, then by the partly finished London &#x00026; Blackwall Railway, hauled by cable, completed in <date when="1841-08">Aug.</date> as 3.3 mi. of five-ft. gauge railway. Cables were replaced by locomotives, <date when="1848">1848</date>&#x02013;<date when="1849">49</date>.</note> across the entire diameter of London, and saw the clear countr<supplied>[y]</supplied> on the <hi rend="italic">east</hi> side of it. Jack never rests; his patient and he fly like a pair of <hi rend="italic">thunder-<foreign>spaiks</foreign></hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pieces of wood tied by string and whirled round the head by children to mimic thunder.</note> For the rest they seem very happy together. The good Doctor! He has sent his <hi rend="italic">second</hi> metal portrait<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A daguerrotype.</note> to our Mother; has Books under way, which James I think will hear tell of about the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>The weather these last three days has been absolutely fiery. The sun blazes down on us with all his fierce splendour; a strong <hi rend="italic">north</hi> wind blows, but even this is like the breath of a furnace, so heated is our continent of stone. We hope for thunder and rain. A little more of this would soon set me travelling; tho&#x02019; as yet I know not at all whitherward. The Glen House can be had for <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>,&#x02014;except the obligation, which indeed is perhaps something! I begin to find on the whole that I must give up my old<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Last page missing. PS at head of letter.</note></p>
<p>We have heard nothing since of my mother; and should like very well indeed to hear! But they are lazy people, and leave us to our <hi rend="italic">hopes</hi></p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Mr</hi>. <hi rend="small-caps">Strachey</hi>,&#x02014;</salute> You judge rightly that it would at any time give me very high satisfaction could I be of the smallest service to the lady now named Mrs. Phillips,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Aurora (&#x0201C;Kitty&#x0201D;) Phillips, b. Kirkpatrick (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x02013;<date when="1889">89</date>), m. James W. Phillips; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240610-TC-MAC-01"><sic>3:81</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1824-06-10">10 June 1824</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241004-TC-JCE-01"><sic>166</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1824-10-04">4 Oct. 1824</date></corr></ref>. E. Strachey says that Mrs. Phillips, his mother&#x02019;s cousin, had asked him to inquire how her da.&#x02019;s ex-governess could find work translating from German.</note> the remembrance of whom, under what name soever, is always pleasant to me! I have, unfortunately, however, no connection at all with any publisher of German things; nor do I know in the least how they manage that business now, except, perhaps, that as there is greatly more demand for German ware in these days than gold, some wages <hi rend="italic">may</hi> now, by wise methods, be derivable from it, which was hardly the case in my days. Mrs. Austin seems to be the established hand at present; Mrs. Jameson, too, works in it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Austin and Anna Jameson.</note> I rather fancy the chief difficulty is to <hi rend="italic">fix on some book</hi> likely to succeed,&#x02014;which of course is the translator&#x02019;s own task. There is seldom any offer of a given book to be translated; or indeed, if there were, I suppose hundreds are ready for it on bread-and-water terms. Translation, I doubt, is no very good resource; indeed, literature in any shape, without some express vocation and necessity, is a thing not to be recommended to any one,&#x02014;to a young lady least of all. My own prosecution of it was entered upon only by the severest compulsion, and has been a life-and-death wrestle all along. Whosover does not think lightly of <hi rend="italic">starvation</hi>, in comparison with several things that he will see practiced, ought to keep aloof altogether from that province.</p>
<p>However, if the young lady so decide on trying the enterprise, I should think her best plan would be to <hi rend="italic">prepare</hi> some actual translation and write it out in a legible hand,&#x02014;some promising book, if she know of one, not of great extent,&#x02014;whereby it could be judged what faculty she had fit for this business, and whether there were any hope in prosecuting it. I could show Mrs. Jameson such a performance; ask her advice about it; she is a reasonable, energetic, and very helpful woman. This is all very light; little other, as you see, than darkness visible.</p>
<p>You are very kind to sympathize so heartily with my books; the response <pb id="pg-13-146" n="13:146"/>of an honest, natural human heart is precious to whomsoever speaks. The tolerance of men is very great; I might say, the rarity of every word honestly spoken, and the growing desire for such, and for such only, is very notable in these times,&#x02014;with deep sorrow, yet with hope that cannot die!</p>
<p>You should have come to see me. But indeed my wayfarings have been a little will-o&#x02019;-wispish this season, and even still liable to be; for I feel I must soon be out of this Nebuchadnezzar furnace<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Dan. 3.</note> of a London, and know not in the least whitherward. Will you offer my loving remembrance to your good lady mother, from whom it is very long since I have heard anything? For yourself, be of good hope; and what is perhaps almost better, be a good patient<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >E. Strachey explains that &#x0201C;for some years I was confined to crutches, couch, and invalid chair&#x0201D; (821).</note> in the interim, resigned to the will of One who knows better than we.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your unexceptionable <hi rend="italic">Bottle of Sea-water</hi>, and your very kind Letter, arrived here, close on the back of one another, the day before yesterday. No Sea-water need, for practical purposes, be clearer; no letter more hospitable or friendly. Whatever become of our project, I can keep it always in memory, as a thing pleasant to think of in this generally not too hospitable world of ours.</p>
<p>The choosing of summer quarters, which is for most people a pleasant enough business, is for me on this occasion an altogether painful and embarrassing one. Few persons can more dislike indertermination than I; and yet to determine is at present in the highest degree difficult. Not summer quarters alone, but probably a permanent change in residence and way of life: all this hangs on the balance! I have discovered, after very sore experimenting, that I cannot live all the year round in London; that if I decide on continuing here, where many otherwise unknown advantages attend continuing, I must decide also on having some country place of refuge, whither when the fret of this place is like to kill me I can run, and hide me and refit. <hi rend="italic">Two</hi> houses;&#x02014;and <pb id="pg-13-147" n="13:147"/>hitherto it has been the sternest of problems to keep <hi rend="italic">one</hi> tight over head! Besides my <hi rend="italic">cat</hi>-like horror of new places; which is always extreme. Probably the place I go to for this season may be my place for many seasons to come. Hence this weighing and counter-weighing; this higgling and cheapening with Destiny,&#x02014;who has her <hi rend="italic">price</hi>, altogether <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> price, for everything, if one could but discover that!</p>
<p>We have the offer of a House (unfurnished) in Dumfriesshire, among my kindred, by the shore of the Solway,&#x02014;not so clear a sea as yours, but my native one: unfortunately this House is 300 and odd miles off; and is the House of a Lord Queensberry, very slightly known to me, who will not have any &#x0201C;rent&#x0201D; for it,&#x02014;a somewhat questionable offer. Then we have Tynemouth (Northumberland) in view; which also is within reach of my native district, and a pleasant shore with deep-<hi rend="italic">blue</hi> sea, and our friend Miss Martineau now living there. Then too the coast of Sussex offers temptations. And lastly, what perhaps is reasonablest of all, one might get a country cottage in the close neighbourhood of London, in Herts, in Essex, Kent or Surrey; fly out thither straightway; and make that, without sea-water, without travel, waste or commotion, serve one for all the year.&#x02014; Every one of these arrangements, the Llandough one added to the list, has its promises, its menaces; they are all hanging on the steelyards <hi rend="italic">together;</hi> you may fancy what a weighing we have! Hitherto I have decided nothing, except that within the next ten days I must and will decide. For I can heartily begin no <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, till I get all that, one way or other put to sleep.</p>
<p>You see therefore how it stands; how I can for the present send you no answer;&#x02014;that I do not, at least, answer in the negative. No: it seems by no means impossible that I by myself, or perhaps the whole of us (for our whole household is but Two and a maid-servant), may come running over to Cardiff and the solitudes of Wales, which are at least solitary, cheap, and the dwellingplace of one friend,&#x02014;there to take from you cheerfully whatsoever help it is prudent between honest-hearted men to render or to receive. You need not write again till you hear. Within some ten days, as I said! I wish you could bottle up your wanton horse, and send him hither!</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It seems very absurd that I do not send you a short line, value one penny, to assure you at least of our welfare here! I think every day I ought to do it; and then again it strikes me our summer plans ought to be matured first. Our summer plans, alas, do not yet indicate maturity: wherefore, today, I will wait no longer, but write as matters stand. Jack has just sent me down your little Note to him; a dear little Note: I will send you this salutation before going out.</p>
<p>Our speculations about a residence do not get on fast here; indeed I have hardly ever in my life been more at a loss to make up my mind. Jane, as you know, does not want to stir at all, but would willingly, were she alone concerned, stay here from <date when="--01">January</date> to <date when="--12">December</date>. She will of course go with me &#x0201C;to any place I like&#x0201D;; but the charge of the whole choice is thus left with me. I feel too as if it were not a choice for one year (<hi rend="italic">which</hi> might very soon be managed), but perhaps a choice for many years; some new arrangement of my way of life, which must not be ventured upon rashly. I should regret greatly to quit London; and yet <hi rend="italic">in</hi> it, my health is always a little worse, and my work has to go on with sore obstruction: <hi rend="italic">What</hi> it were of all things wisest for me to do? This is a question! On the whole I can but repeat your prayer, &#x0201C;May we be guided to some <hi rend="italic">true</hi> decision!&#x0201D; &#x02014; At bottom too the chief grievance at present is that I am not yet fixed heartily to any work, and even do not like to fix on any till I have got some arrangement about a habitation. Why should I begin <hi rend="italic">weaving</hi>, till my <hi rend="italic">loom</hi> is fairly set up!</p>
<p>After much study, in many humours, I begin to see that the House at the Glen will not suit us. I dread, not. Its being the <hi rend="italic">gift</hi> of anybody is a bad feature of it. And then the furniture;&#x02014;one might launch out a considerable quantity of money and trouble of all kinds; and then not find it do!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Offered rent-free but unfurnished by the Marquess of Queensberry.</note> I wrote about a fortnight ago to Ben Nelson, asking about Jamie Ewart&#x02019;s furniture,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Ewart, grocer and spirit dealer, High St., Annan; previously a draper; he was now also a shipowner.</note> <hi rend="italic">what</hi> it really was &#x00026;c; Ben has yet made no answer: but indeed I do not much think any answer of his would now decide us for the Glen. I do not want any grand house of that kind: ah no, a little cottage would serve for all I want!</p>
<p>Another entirely different scheme you have sometimes heard of is that of getting out into the <hi rend="italic">neighbourhood</hi> of London there to reside <pb id="pg-13-150" n="13:150"/>all the year round, without the necessity to shift at all. Well; I went out one day into a place called Epping Forest,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Essex, ca. 20 mi. NE of London.</note> to look for houses with this view: I had a pleasant enough walk; but as for houses, found none, at all likely.&#x02014; I have to go and see Brighton also which is on the <hi rend="italic">coast</hi>, some sixty miles off. And then the Welshman,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Redwood.</note> he still lies, poor fellow, as another resource. And indeed the weather hitherto has been so very cold, ever till yesterday, that there was no great haste about quitting London. In a few days now, however, I must and will decide, were it even unwisely.</p>
<p>Thus, dear Mother, have I explained our uncertainties. What a blessing that they are of no worse character; that we have some money at any rate, to go whither we like when any place grows insupportable!&#x02014; Jane is well; I too am well, and hope to grow better.</p>
<p>Jack comes down to dine with us every Sabbath; he and Ogilvy, or sometimes he himself, will dash in at various other odd times thro&#x02019; the week. The day before yesterday, they even had me up to dine with them. They are good people in their way; poor Ogilvy is himself a hapless interesting man. Jack seems to think him improving; they fly about in all directions, drive every evening in their carriage &#x00026;c &#x00026;c It all goes right enough, I think; and the only fault of the place, if that be a fault, is that there still is very little or at bottom almost nothing <hi rend="italic">to do</hi> in it. Jack is, of course, a considerable comfort to me here.</p>
<p>Alas, here is a poor man, by name Thackeray, just come in from Paris; where his poor Wife is left, having fallen <hi rend="italic">insane</hi> on his hands some six or eight months ago!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410409-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1841-04-09">10[9] April</date></ref>. Isabella Thackeray showed the first signs of insanity, <date when="1840-09">Sept. 1840</date>. She was treated in France and Germany; Thackeray brought her back to England in <date when="1845">1845</date>, where she remained under constant care for the rest of her life. The Carlyles did much to befriend Thackeray and his two das. See Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CF</hi> 226&#x02013;66.</note> I believe he is not well off for cash either, poor Thackeray (tho&#x02019; <hi rend="italic">born</hi> a rich man); he is very clever, with pen and pencil; an honest man, in no inconsiderable distress! He seems as if he had no better place, of all the great places he once knew, than our poor house to take shelter in!&#x02014;Welcome the coming guest, especially him that is in misfortune! I must go down to poor Thakeray,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> and bid my Mother farewell. Does Alick forgive me that I have not written? Ah me, I will write to him, to Jenny, and to them all, if they give me time. My heart&#x02019;s love with every one of them. Jean says that you, dear Mother, are a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> thinner, but not otherwise ailing. The Summer weather I hope will set you up again. Be good to <pb id="pg-13-151" n="13:151"/>yourself! The good Isabella does not let you want for <hi rend="italic">news?</hi> Good be with you all ever!</p>

<salute>Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came on the evening of Saturday, an hour after all our posts, or I would have written without loss of a moment. Nothing had been fixed here, except the <hi rend="italic">giving up</hi> of the Glen House; but things were on the point of <hi rend="italic">being</hi> fixed; the long uncertainty had become insupportable to us. Ben Nelson even had never written, I knew not for what reason; and I had set about resolving without any news from him. Tomorrow morning I was to go to Brighton; and failing there, I meant to hold straight towards Wales. We have had an altogether deplorable dubitation about this matter, and are both of us extremely glad to see a prospect of ending it.</p>
<p>If what Jamie says about the rent of Newington<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Newington Lodge.</note> be correct, that it can be had for &#x0201C;a half less rent&#x0201D; (that is to say for the half of &#xa3;26), it will be a cheap house indeed, and I will commission him or you to go straightway and secure it for us. Pray set off without delay, and make <pb id="pg-13-153" n="13:153"/>the bargain with Carruthers.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Carruthers, previously &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">hash</hi> Wull&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-02/lt-18220222-TC-AC-01"><sic>2:54</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1822-02-22">22 Feb. 1822</date></corr></ref>) of Breckonhill, who was a lawyer in Annan (<ref target="volume-08/lt-18351127-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:258</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-11-27">27 Nov. 1835</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370921-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:313</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-09-21">21 Sept. 1837</date></corr></ref>).</note> I put this Letter in a certain office this night, and you will get it I think on Tuesday morning thereby. Send somebody over with it to Jamie; and let him or you lose no time in acting; and then directly let us know that you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> acted.&#x02014; We shall gather ourselves together in not many days after that, and see old Annandale once again! This house will do much better than the Marquis&#x02019;s,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Queensberry. Glen Stewart House.</note> where I felt I could never have been at ease. We can make up any kind of <hi rend="italic">gypsey</hi> establishment within four walls <hi rend="italic">of our own</hi> (for that is quite a different matter) and live there, &#x0201C;free and independent,&#x0201D; in such sort as our means will allow.</p>
<p>But now if the house should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be procurable for &#xa3;13? That is the question for you!&#x02014; Well; I can only say I should rather give a pound or two <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, than miss it at present: you must endeavour to <hi rend="italic">deal</hi> with Carruthers, and do the best you can.</p>
<p>Above all things, do not let us fail for want of writing,&#x02014;in these penny-post times! Write to us, half a word, the instant anything is fixed with C.,&#x02014;perhaps on Tuesday itself; at all events on Wednesday: we got your last on Saturday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> about 6 o&#x02019;clock; you will know what length of time that takes: our other <hi rend="italic">Country</hi> post is about 11 in the morning.&#x02014; I go upon the hypothesis already that you <hi rend="italic">get</hi> the house; and will be partly arranging on that basis. Yet still we are not <hi rend="italic">tied</hi> (if things unexpectedly grow perverse): we have a habitation <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> and all England and Europe to choose upon!</p>
<p>If Nelson&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">invoice</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had written to ask Nelson about Jamie Ewart&#x02019;s furniture, <date when="1841-06">early in June</date>.</note> were complete, we should rejoice to see it! Perhaps it may come tomorrow morning. <supplied>[If we]</supplied> then knew what rooms there are, we <supplied>[coul]</supplied>d begin scheming and projecting.</p>
<p>Our dear Mother will rejoice that we have a likelihood of getting near her,&#x02014;as you all will. Jack is here at this moment (smoking a cigar in the garden): all right. They call on me &#x0201C;for Tea&#x0201D;; there is not a moment&#x02019;s time for more. Do swiftly what you find written here, and then let us hear. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother.&#x02014;Ever your aff<hi rend="italic">e</hi></salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>For a good while past it has occasionally seemed to me as if I might do worse than, some time or other, write an Essay on that notable Phenomenon, consisting of George Sand, Abb&#xE9; Lamennais &#x00026;c with their writings; what Goethe well names the &#x0201C;Literature of Desperation.&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Sand, pseud. of Amandine Aurore Lucile, b. Dupin, Baronne Dudevant (<date when="1804">1804</date>&#x02013;<date when="1876">76</date>), novelist; intimate of Alfred de Musset and Frederic Chopin; member of an artistic group including Chopin, Liszt, Balzac, Delacroix, and F&#xE9;licit&#xE9; Robert de Lamennais (<date when="1782">1782</date>&#x02013;<date when="1854">1854</date>), religious writer (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400316-TC-RMM-01"><sic>12:74</sic><corr>TC to RMM, <date when="1840-03-16">16 March 1840</date></corr></ref>).

The taste for it, among Radical men, especially among Radical women, is spreading everywhere: perhaps a good word on it, in these circumstances, were worthy of uttering?&#x02014;</p>
<p>For several reasons, especially at the present moment, your Review rather than another were the place for such a thing. I do not know, of late years, how you go on at all; but I think, if you gave me elbow-room, I might produce a useful and pleasant piece, not entirely discordant with your general tendencies. At all events, I will ask you to write me, as soon as possible, a word on this project. I hope very shortly to get away into my native region for some months: if, on closer practical inspection, the thing seemed feasible and suitable, I might take the necessary Books with me, and occupy some portion of my leisure with it there.&#x02014; Before a week, I shall certainly not have left this place.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many months ago you were kind enough to send me your <hi rend="italic">Sordello;</hi> and now this day I have been looking into your <hi rend="italic">Pippa passes</hi>, for which also I am your debtor.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Sordello</hi>, a poem in six bks. (<date when="1840">1840</date>). For <hi rend="italic">Pippa Passes</hi> (<date when="1841">1841</date>), see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410422-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1841-04-22">22 April</date>]</ref>.</note> If I have made no answer hitherto, it was surely not for want of interest in you, for want of estimation of you: both Pieces have given rise to many reflexions in me, not without friendly hopes and anxieties in due measure. Alas, it is so seldom that any word one can speak is not worse than a word still unspoken;&#x02014;seldom that one man, by <hi rend="italic">his</hi> speaking or his silence, can, in great vital interests, help one another at all!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Unless I very greatly mistake, judging from these two works, you seem to possess a rare spiritual gift, practical, pictorial, intellectual, by whatever name we may prefer calling it; to unfold which into articulate clearness is naturally the problem of all problems for you. This noble endowment, it seems to me farther, you are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> at present on the best way for unfolding;&#x02014;and if the world had loudly called itself content with these two Poems, my surmise is, the world could have rendered you no fataller disservice than that same! Believe me I speak with sincerity; and if I had not loved you well, I would not have spoken at all.</p>
<p>A long battle, I could guess, lies before you, full of toil and pain, and all sorts of real <hi rend="italic">fighting:</hi> a man attains to nothing here below without that. Is it not verily the highest prize you fight for? Fight on; that is to say, follow truly, with steadfast singleness of purpose, with valiant humbleness and openness of heart, what best light <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can attain to; following truly so, better and ever better light will rise on you. The light we ourselves gain, by our very errors if not otherwise, is the only precious light. Victory, what I call victory, if well fought for, is sure to you.</p>
<p>If your own choice happened to point that way, I for one should hail it as a good omen that your next work were written in prose! Not that I deny you poetic faculty; far, very far from that. But unless poetic faculty mean a higher-power of common understanding, I know not what it means. One must first make a <hi rend="italic">true</hi> intellectual representation <pb id="pg-13-156" n="13:156"/>of a thing, before any poetic interest that is true will supervene. All <hi rend="italic">cartoons</hi> are geometrical withal; and cannot be made till we have fully learnt to make mere <hi rend="italic">diagrams</hi> well. It is this that I mean by prose;&#x02014;which hint of mine, most probably inapplicable at present, may perhaps at some future day come usefully to mind.</p>
<p>But enough of this: why have I written all this? Because I esteem yours no common case; and think such a man is not to be treated in the common way.</p>
<p>And so persist in God&#x02019;s name, as you best see and can; and understand always that my true prayer for you is, Good speed in the name of God!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1885-08-13">13 Aug. 1885</date> Browning sent Charles Eliot Norton some of his letters from TC and wrote: &#x0201C;The first of the Letters was written, as you see, forty-four years ago; and the goodness and sympathy which began so long ago continued unabated to the end of the writer&#x02019;s life. I repaid them with just as enduring an affectionate gratitude. It was not I who ventured to make the acquaintance nor ask the correspondence of Carlyle: his love was altogether a free gift, and how much it has enriched my life I shall hardly attempt to say&#x02014;certainly not at this moment, when I write in all the haste of approaching departure from home&#x0201D; (A. Carlyle, pref. to <hi rend="italic">CMSB</hi>).</note></p>
<p>I would have called for you last year when I had a horse, and some twice rode thro&#x02019; your suburb;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Browning lived with his parents and sister in Hatcham, Surrey.</note> but stupidly I had forgotten your address;&#x02014;and you, you never came again hither!</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>After not a little dubitation and negotiation, in the midst of which your hospitable Welsh Coast more than once looked forth with welcome likelihood, and always lay as a solacing background and place of ultimate refuge, it has now been as good as settled that we are to encamp in my native country for this summer. The offer of a house, furnished so as to be habitable, on very cheap terms, in that quarter, did at last suffice to decide us. The place is designated &#x0201C;Newington Lodge, Annan, N.B.&#x0201D;&#x02014; I wrote by last post to close the bargain; and hope to hear this week that all is fixed,&#x02014;the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> of all fixed, and supplementary adjustments set in progress. If the scheme still go off, you <pb id="pg-13-157" n="13:157"/>shall hear from me again. If you hear nothing, I will send you in two or three weeks some Dumfriesshire Newspaper, in which you will see the one postmark, and infer that we are settled as I now forecast; and resolute to hold out in that quiet country till the last gleam of summer weather has left the sky, or till this parched Horror of a Babel has grown to seem desirable again.</p>
<p>As to your valley of Glamorgen I will by no means renounce the hope of seeing it with my eyes one day; and already, on the very map, it has a beauty for us beyond that of hills and rivers: this chiefest beauty and essence of all attraction, that there is a kind heart there, sometimes thinking of us there, making the dead waste Earth into a home and garden for us there! Think not that your kind invitation, tho&#x02019; unaccepted, came in vain; not so, by no means so.</p>
<p>When you come to London again, seek us out, and stay longer with us. May your good Mother<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Redwood (d. <date when="1846">1846</date>).</note> return to you happily; may all go well with you and her.</p>

<p>Accept many thanks for your kind gift of <hi rend="italic">Nala</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Nala and Damayanti, and Other Poems</hi>, trans. from Sanskrit (Oxford, <date when="1835">1835</date>).

He took up Sanskrit in the last two years of his appointment, lectured on the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ramayana</hi>, and pbd. &#x0201C;Sanscrit Poetry and Hindu Drama,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> 45 (<date when="1831-04">April 1831</date>):1&#x02013;38, 39&#x02013;57.</note> which I have read with great interest and pleasure. Such a Translation was well worth making, since you could so make it. Whether, indeed, that fine trumpet music to which we rhythmically march with such satisfaction, come altogether from the Sanscrit, none of us knows,&#x02014;except yourself!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The metrical form used by Milman is discussed in his pref. (vii&#x02013;viii), and is the Sloka, a distich of two lines. Milman used fifteen-syllable lines.</note> But come from where it may, it is very fine. An ancient earnest spirit reigns in the old Poem: in curious dialect, great rude traits of human passions, human destinies, disclose themselves;&#x02014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">aliquid humani</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-13-158" n="13:158"/>[some human element] from which no <foreign><hi rend="italic">homo</hi></foreign> [man] of us, in what dialect soever he may speak, can be entirely a foreigner.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x0201C;<foreign>Homo sum; humani nihil a me alienum puto</foreign> [I am a man; there is nothing that touches man that is not my concern],&#x0201D; Terence, <hi rend="italic">Heautontimorumenos</hi> 77.</note></p>
<p>I like the other pieces too; great Cyclopean things. What a head of hair that God must have had, which could hold the Ganges running in it for half a century or more!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In &#x0201C;The Descent of the Ganges&#x0201D; (145&#x02013;48), as Milman explains, Ganga descends through &#x0201C;the locks of Shiva&#x0201D; that are &#x0201C;Vast and boundless as the woods upon the Himalaya&#x02019;s brow.&#x0201D;</note>&#x02014;</p>
<p>Since I saw you I have also read the <hi rend="italic">Moallakat</hi> and other Eastern things.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Moallak&#xe2;t, or Seven Arabian Poems</hi> (<date when="1783">1783</date>), trans. Sir William Jones (<date when="1746">1746</date>&#x02013;<date when="1794">94</date>), poet, scholar and judge in India. TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1841-06-04">4 June</date>: &#x0201C;Jones seems to me rather an inconclusive, unproductive character: his curiosity and memory (his &#x02018;learning&#x02019; the fruit of these) are great, probably &#x02018;immense&#x02019; if you will; but the knowledge he conveys is small in proportion. His intellect I do not call great; the whole man is vivacious, dextrous, rather than great. Prettily <hi rend="italic">articulated;</hi> balanced, smooth-shaven, orthodox-tolerant, &#x00026;c &#x00026;c according to the approved fashion of that age: but except his <hi rend="italic">Translations</hi>, what is there in him that you can <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> for any useful purpose; what that will at bottom repay the trouble of reading? A certain subdued but very evident self-conceit, a petty turn for antithesis, a certain clear-varnished <hi rend="italic">Pharasiaco-dandiacal</hi> air of Oxfordian blinded even with a dash of <hi rend="italic">red-tapist</hi> (a very barren tho&#x02019; accredited combination) disaffects me still more. I will thank him for his <hi rend="italic">Moallakat</hi> (could I once find it in our Library, as I have once failed to do), for his <hi rend="italic">Sacuntala</hi> [Kalidasa&#x02019;s Sanskrit drama, trans. by Jones (<date when="1789">1789</date>)], for his Persian fragments &#x00026;c; and leave him resting on his own basis.&#x0201D; TC had borrowed two vols. of Jones&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> from the London Library, <date when="1841-06-05">5 June</date>.</note> A beautiful Book might be gleaned out of Jones, by taking merely his Translations which are almost all good, and leaving out his Disquisitions and Originalities which are all of an entirely transitory character. Strange how Antar<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arabian poet and warrior of the sixth cent. &#x0201C;The Poem of Antara&#x0201D; is fifth in the <hi rend="italic">Moallak&#xe2;t, The Works of Sir William Jones</hi>, 6 vols.

<p>When are our Oriental Books to be got into the Library? I hope soon, and also well.&#x02014; I am to come to you if I can next Saturday, and propose the speedy printing of some kind of Alphabetical List (not a Librarian&#x02019;s Catalogue at all, but a mere Auctioneer&#x02019;s List, of the simplest sort, till we have time for a <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi> proper) of what Books we have or are soon to get: a thing for which all manner of subscribers are dunning me. I incline to think it might answer. We could print it as the roughest of Pamphlets, and cover the expences by selling it to Subscribers at a shilling each; moreover, if we had a man to hawk it <pb id="pg-13-159" n="13:159"/>thro&#x02019; the world, would <hi rend="italic">it</hi> not be the best of all <hi rend="italic">Advertisements</hi> for us?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milman was one of the leading committee members, elected <date when="1841-04-26">26 April</date>. At a meeting, <date when="1841-06-26">26 June</date>, TC proposed and it was agreed that the librarian prepare a brief alphabetical catalogue to be printed; it was finished in <date when="1841-11">Nov.</date>, and sold for 2s. od.</note> Pray consider this. Our Bookshelves at present are a chaos, in which no reader can find his way; and before a regular &#x0201C;class catalogue&#x0201D; can be in readiness there may be many months and much complaining.</p>
<p>The daylight fails me, and I take my leave.</p>

June</date>]: &#x0201C;I have just been looking over some pages of a new work called Emerson&#x02019;s essays; the copy was a present sent by the author to a Lady, so that I could get no answer to my question: is it to be had any where in London. / I have been so struck with the little I have read that I should feel uncomfortable were I obliged to go away without having the book in my pocket. Must I get it from America? can you name me a bookseller that corresponds with that country?&#x0201D;</note> Failing Mrs M., John Sterling has a copy, which I think I can get with some difficulty.

<p>We hope now we have got a house in Scotland in my birthland; very cheap, commodious, tolerably solitary, yet within reach of my kindred and of most of the North-Country people I care about. It <pb id="pg-13-160" n="13:160"/>is close by a place called Annan; final news of the bargain being struck are expected this week. Do you know the Scotch song:</p>

<salute>Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came punctually last night: thanks for your punctuality; for all the trouble you are taking about me. You and Jamie would be wearied enough before 11 at night that Tuesday,&#x02014;and the business not to be finished after all!</p>
<p>It seems, however, already certain that we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to undertake this same Newington adventure, prove as it may; I infer from your Letter that you <hi rend="italic">would</hi> take the house, last night, from Carruther&#x02019;s even at his own rent; that the only question undecided was as to certain additional pounds of expense. That was right; and according to the spirit of the directions I gave you. The expense indeed is greater than I anticipated; for, foolishly, I had supposed that as the first rent of the place, <hi rend="italic">park and all</hi>, seemed to be &#xa3;26, the half of it all would be some &#xa3;13!&#x02014; However, we must rush <hi rend="italic">forward</hi> now, I fancy; and go thro&#x02019; with it, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> counting costs too strictly. If I can get a little clear health and composure back again, it will be a cheap purchase at any price I have money to pay.</p>
<p>Nelson&#x02019;s neglect to write is a thing I cannot complain of, for the whole office was one of charity on his part; but it does really seem <pb id="pg-13-161" n="13:161"/>astonishing. One word would have been so easily written, any time these three weeks!&#x02014; Well, we do not yet know Ewart&#x02019;s furniture; we must go forward, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> knowing it then. The <hi rend="italic">shape</hi> of the House, number of rooms, whether there are stables &#x00026;c &#x00026;c: all this is unfortunately quite dark to me. I can accordingly give you no advice about the little Park: probably it is not necessary to decide that, all at once, or till I myself am there; you in the meanwhile can consider how a horse can best be kept, whether on hard old hay (and what the price of that is),&#x02014;and do what <hi rend="italic">undelayable</hi> thing may arise in the wisest way you can. I should like right well to have <hi rend="italic">riding</hi> too: but that along with <hi rend="italic">gigging</hi>, I suppose, is impossible. I wish I had my sleek black mare back again;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Citoyenne; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400926-TC-RWE-01"><sic>12:267</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1840-09-26">26 Sept. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> which I sold, last year, saddle and all for &#xa3;17!</p>
<p>We expect to hear from you again tomorrow evening, as to the result of Thursday. Meanwhile we both take for almost as good as certain that we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to come; and so shall begin to bestir ourselves without delay. Do not fail to write! One word can be written; and a single penny will carry it as on the wings of the wind.</p>
<p>On the whole, it seems agreed between us here, that we shall get no sense of the real figure of affairs till one of us be on the spot. Jane and her maid,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Mitchell.</note> accordingly, are to remain here, ready for all sorts of packing and sorting; while I forthwith depart for Annandale, and tell them <hi rend="italic">what</hi> to pack and sort. Your Letter of tomorrow evening <hi rend="italic">can</hi>, of course, still give me pause; but I do not think it will. I have some small things to settle; and then&#x02014;off! It is likeliest, if the weather grow hot, especially,&#x02014;that I may come by sea and Newcastle: I want to lose no time now, and shall try to be off next week!&#x02014; Ah me, my dear Brother, it is a terrible confusion for me, all this; but I cannot help it; I must do it. May it answer well!</p>
<p>Jack has not been here since Sunday. Jane was sickly for a week; but brightens up again. She is hearty for Newington; nay heartier than I, now that it comes to the actual push.</p>
<p>Not a word more. My dear Mother hears what we are doing; with pleasure, I doubt not. <closer><salute>Good be with you all!</salute></closer></p>

<dateline><place>Chelsea, London</place>, <date when="1841-06-25">25 june, 1841</date>&#x02014;</dateline>
<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Now that there begins again to be some program possible of my future motions for some time, I hastily despatch you some needful outline of the same.</p>
<p>After infinite confused uncertainty, I learn yesternight that there has been a kind of country-house got for us, at a place called Annan, on the north shore of the Solway Frith, in my native county of Dumfries. You passed thro&#x02019; the little Burgh, I suppose, in your way homeward from Craigenputtoch: it stands about midway, on the great road, between Dumfries and Carlisle. It is the place where I got my schooling;&#x02014;consider what a <hi rend="italic">preter</hi>natural significance such a scene has now got for me! It is within eight miles of my aged Mother&#x02019;s dwelling-place; within riding distance, in fact, of almost all the kindred I have in the world.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; The house, which is built since my time, and was never yet seen by me, is said to be a reasonable kind of house. We get it for a small sum in proportion to its value (thanks to kind accident); the 300 miles of travel, very hateful to me, will at least entirely obliterate all traces of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Dust-Babel; the place too being naturally almost ugly, as far as a green leafy place in sight of sea and mountains can be so nicknamed, the whole gang of picturesque Tourists, Cockney friends of Nature &#x00026;c &#x00026;c, who penetrate now by steam, in shoals every autum,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> into the very centre of the Scotch Highlands,&#x02014;will be safe over the horizon! In short, we are all bound thitherward in few days; must cobble up some kind of gypsey establishment; and bless Heaven for solitude, for the sight of green fields, heathy moors; for a silent sky over one&#x02019;s head, and air to breathe which does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> consist of coal-smoke, finely powdered flint, and other beautiful <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign> of that kind among others! God knows I have need enough to be left altogether alone for some considerable while (<hi rend="italic">forever</hi>, as it at present seems to me), to get my inner world, and my poor bodily nerves, both all torn to pieces, set in order a little again! After much vain reluctance therefore; disregarding many considerations,&#x02014;disregarding <hi rend="italic">finance</hi> in the front of these,&#x02014;I am off; and calculate on staying till I am heartily <hi rend="italic">sated</hi> with country, till at least the last gleam of summer weather has departed. My way of life has all along hitherto been a resolute <hi rend="italic">staying at home:</hi> I find now however that I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> alter <pb id="pg-13-163" n="13:163"/>my habits, cost what it may; that I cannot live all the year round in London, under pain of dying or going rabid;&#x02014;that I must, in fact, learn to travel, as others do, and be hanged to me! Wherefore, in brief, my Friend, our address for the next two or three months is &#x0201C;Newington Lodge, Annan, Scotland,&#x0201D;&#x02014;when a letter from Emerson will be a right pleasant visitor! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Faustum sit</hi></foreign> [May it turn out well].</p>
    <p>My second piece of news, not less interesting I hope, is that <hi rend="italic">Emerson&#x02019;s Essays</hi>, the Book so-called, is to be reprinted here; nay, I think, is even now at press,&#x02014;in the hands of that invaluable Printer, Robson, who did the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>. Fraser undertakes it, &#x0201C;on <hi rend="italic">half-profits</hi>&#x0201D;; T. Carlyle writing a Preface,&#x02014;which accordingly he did (in rather sullen humour,&#x02014;not with you!) last night and the foregoing days.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x02019;s pref., 6 pp., dated <date when="1841-08-11">11 Aug.</date>, is mostly concerned to praise Emerson as a writer for &#x0201C;the small thinking public,&#x0201D; notable for &#x0201C;the many things he has not spoken and has forborne to do &#x02026; one of those rare men who have withal the invaluable talent of sitting still!&#x0201D; It presents him as a Carlylean American hero uninterested in &#x0201C;Pleasures of Virtue, Progress of the Species, Black Emancipation, New Tariff, Eclecticism, Locofocoism, ghost of improved Socinianism,&#x0201D; which are &#x0201C;squeaking, jabbering &#x02026; round this man.&#x0201D; It briefly outlines Emerson&#x02019;s previous work, and refers to the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>&#x02019; &#x0201C;literary talent&#x0201D; as secondary: &#x0201C;The utterance is abrupt, fitful; the great idea not yet embodied struggles towards an embodiment.&#x0201D; It sees him as valuable because &#x0201C;the idea&#x0201D; is &#x0201C;the chief question.&#x0201D; &#x0201C;In a word while so many Benthamisms, Socialisms, Fourrierisms, <hi rend="italic">professing</hi> to have no soul, go staggering and lowing like monstrous mooncalves&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;even galvanic Puseyisms &#x02026; are visible, and dancings of the sheeted dead,&#x02014;shall not any voice of a living man be welcome to us, even because it is alive?&#x0201D; Robson, Levey &#x00026; Franklyn were the printers.</note> Robson will stand by the text to the very utmost; and I also am to read the Proof-sheets. The edition is of 750; which Fraser thinks he will sell. With what joy shall I then sack up the small &#xa3;10 sterling perhaps of &#x0201C;Half-profits&#x0201D; and remit them to the man Emerson; saying: There, man! Tit for <supplied>[tat]</supplied> the reciprocity <hi rend="italic">not</hi> all on one side!&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; I ought to say, moreover, that this was a volunteer scheme of Fraser&#x02019;s; the risk is all his, the origin of it was with him: I advised him to have it reviewed, as being a really noteworthy Book; &#x0201C;write you a Preface,&#x0201D; said he, &#x0201C;and I will reprint it&#x0201D;;&#x02014;to which, after due delay and meditation, I consented. Let me add only, on this subject, the story of a certain Rio, a French Breton, with long, distracted, black hair. He found your Book at Richard Milnes&#x02019;s, a borrowed copy, and could not borrow it; whereupon he appeals passionately to me; carries off my wife&#x02019;s copy, this distracted Rio; and is to &#x0201C;read it <hi rend="italic">four</hi> times&#x0201D; during this current autumn, at Quimperle in his native Celtdom!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexis Fran&#xe7;ois Rio. Quimperl&#xE9; is in Brittany, NW France.</note> The man withal is a <hi rend="italic">Catholic</hi>, eats fish on friday;&#x02014;a great lion here when he visits us; one of the <hi rend="italic">naivest</hi> men in the world: concerning whom nevertheless, <pb id="pg-13-164" n="13:164"/>among fashionables, there is a controversy, &#x0201C;Whether he is an Angel, or partially a Windbag and <hi rend="italic">Humbug?</hi>&#x0201D; Such is the lot of loveliness in the world! A <hi rend="italic">truer</hi> man I never saw; how <hi rend="italic">wind</hi>less, how windy, I will not compute at present. Me he likes greatly (in spite of my unspeakable contempt for his fish on friday); likes,&#x02014;but withal is apt to <hi rend="italic">bore</hi>.</p>
<p>Enough, dear Emerson; and more than enough for a day so hurried. Our Island is all in a ferment electioneering: Tories to come in;&#x02014;perhaps not to come in; at all events not to stay long, without altering their figure much! I sometimes ask myself rather earnestly, What is the duty of a Citizen? To be, as I have been hitherto, a pacific <hi rend="italic">alien?</hi> That is the <hi rend="italic">easiest</hi>, with my humour!&#x02014; Our brave Dame here, just rallying for the <hi rend="italic">remove</hi>, sends loving salutations. <closer><salute>Good be with you always. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear E.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Again I have to thank you for your punctuality, both in despatch of business, and in apprising me about it. A short letter in such cases is well worth writing; and what a stupidity were it to neglect such a thing,&#x02014;which nevertheless many are so apt to do!</p>
<p>My plan is still to set off by the Newcastle Steamer, which leaves this on Wednesday evening at 8 o&#x02019;clock.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1841-06-30">30 June</date>.</note> The weather is grown very wet: but I have a <hi rend="italic">mackintosh;</hi> we must take the weather as it comes. The Steamer should arrive at Newcastle, I think, on Friday morning. I must see Miss Martineau as I pass; perhaps, since nothing is <pb id="pg-13-166" n="13:166"/>concluded at Newington, I may as well take a view withal of the lodgings about Tynemouth, and what kind of country that is. We once had it in our eye: Scotsbrig is within reach of it, and the <hi rend="italic">sea</hi> at least I believe is greatly preferable to your Solway,&#x02014;as is the communication with London. Of course I should <hi rend="italic">settle</hi> nothing till you are spoken with; nor indeed is there anything likely to turn up so good as Newington: however, we can look.</p>
<p>The Newcastle Railway-<hi rend="italic">times</hi> have gone out of my head, and I have no paper of them here. My freest plan will be to regulate myself by the time of your Carlisle evening mail; which I do remember must leave Carlisle sometime between 4 and 6 o&#x02019;clock. On Friday evening, it is possible that I may come; but considerably likelier next evening. If you hear nothing more of me, Jamie might be over with the gig at Ecclefechan on Saturday evening, and look whether I am not in the coach! On Monday we could go down to Annan, and start business.</p>
<p>Things standing so, I will write this day to Wull Carruthers to have all his answers ready, at a word, on Monday; and also that he need not conclude anything whatever till then, as I am coming so soon. You will not need to take any farther trouble with him, or see him at all on Thursday next, unless you chance to be down to Annan at any rate. This seems the reasonablest arrangement.</p>
<p>Your account of Ewart&#x02019;s furniture is precise enough for practical purposes: why did not Nelson, in three words, send it long ago! Your own contributions to our projected stock are very kind, friendly as ever from you all: we must not strip you naked; we must see what can be done.</p>
<p>Jack was here last night; is coming tonight again.

<salute>My dear Mrs Stanley,</salute>
<p>After considerable voyaging and wayfaring for a week past, I find myself arrived here once more;&#x02014;and, alas, have still to ask with some dubiety, Whither next? In a day or two now, I do hope, that question will have got some kind of answer for a quarter of a year to come. It is a fearful curse that of the Prophet, &#x0201C;Make them like unto a wheel!&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 83:13.</note>&#x02014; You shall hear from me again, so soon as I have any address likely to last above a week.</p>
<p>Today my petition to you is, for a Cheshire Newspaper, or the smallest Note of hand, that I may learn how your Election has gone,&#x02014;or promises to go if still undecided.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There candidates for North Cheshire&#x02019;s two M.P.s were nominated at Knutsford, <date when="1841-07-05">5 July</date>. A show of hands declared in favor of W. Tatton Egerton and George Cornwall Legh, the conservatives, and against Edward Stanley, whig, who demanded a poll. On <date when="1841-07-12">12 July</date> Egerton gained 2,782 votes, Legh 2,652, and Stanley lost with 2,206. Stanley had been sec. to the treasury in the whig govt.</note> My fears for the Cheshire yeomen are great; the heads of yeomen and men are very thick! Unless, indeed, there be <hi rend="italic">witches</hi> in North Cheshire&#x02014;?&#x02014; Who knows! We will hope the best, till we hear otherwise.</p>
<p>The result of the Elections in general, it seems already, is all gone awry; our poor Whigs are out, and Peel and the Sliding Scale are in.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The whigs wanted a fixed duty on imported grain; Peel&#x02019;s conservatives advocated a sliding scale depending on the price of grain in the country during the current year.</note> Well;&#x02014;and yet it is not well. I declare, the aspect of these things is sad to see. The Whigs will come in again when they grow wiser. If they do not grow wiser, they had better stay out. God mend us all; we ought all to grow wiser!&#x02014;</p>
<p>I have found out Alderly Park on the maps, and discover now that I have often whirled past it, sending no thought thitherward.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alderley Park, the Stanleys&#x02019; family seat in E Cheshire, 14 mi. S of Manchester, was noted for its woods, containing some of the largest beech trees in England, and for the lake, Radnor Mere.</note> Surely I shall never do <hi rend="italic">so</hi> again any more.</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mrs Stanley. I am in infinite hurry, in confusion worse confounded,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 2:996.</note> as is usual when I return hither.</p>
<p>This place, now a rough Farm-house, was once a Border Robber-Tower, belonging to &#x0201C;the Carlyles,&#x0201D; to &#x0201C;the Bells&#x0201D; or I know not whom; <pb id="pg-13-168" n="13:168"/>and called itself <hi rend="italic">Godsbrig,&#x02014;Bridge</hi> built by <hi rend="italic">God;</hi> over a chasm of rocks, and &#x0201C;Devils Cauldron&#x0201D; we have got here.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to a note in <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 1, &#x0201C;It was anciently called Gotsbrig, and was once a border &#x02018;keep&#x02019; or tower.&#x0201D; See also <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 17&#x02013;18.</note> Only think of that.&#x02014; This whole region is to me like a kind of <hi rend="italic">Hades;</hi> or even ghastlier and stranger than that can well be,&#x02014;were we once got to it.</p>
<p><closer><salute>&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014;In one word, I beg for a Newspaper, for a Note, for some tolerant Non-oblivion; and am and remain always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jeannie,</salute>
<p>I said, in two posts expect to hear from me again. Alas, Dearikin, yesterday was a day of continual rain, unfit for any human creature&#x02019;s travelling; a day fit only for &#x0201C;proving one&#x02019;s mackintosh&#x0201D;: I sat all day within doors, reading the scoundrel Balzac<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Honor&#xE9; de Balzac (<date when="1799">1799</date>&#x02013;<date when="1850">1850</date>), novelist; presumably <hi rend="italic">Sc&#xE8;nes de la vie Parisienne;</hi> see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410621-TC-MN-01">TC to MN, <date when="1841-06-21">21 June</date></ref>.</note> (brutallest blackguard now extant with any talent), and consequently there was nothing whatever done. Today, blessed be Heaven, for the first time since I left you the blessed sun shines out, and there is prospect of an altogether lovely day. Jamie and I set out for Annan, to see this wondrous Newington,&#x02014;also to investigate another chance there has arisen of geting a kind of house <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> furnished. The furnishing of Newington does not flatter my imagination much at present; a fine house, but the stock of goods to put in it a scanty and very miscellaneous one: however, there is certainly nothing to be had <hi rend="italic">without</hi> trouble; we will endeavour to choose the eligiblest, and to have the thing set in motion if possible this very day. The furnished house is a dandy cottage close by the shore at a place called Newby (which Jack knows, tho&#x02019; the cottage is <hi rend="italic">since</hi> his time); a mile and half from Annan to walk, three miles to ride or drive. I shall see and try; I will write to you what I have seen probably tomorrow.</p>
<p>Add only, dear Jeannie, that my Carlisle sleepless night<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably <date when="1841-07-03">Sat., 3 July</date>.</note> has not yet been followed by any sufficient sleep. Yesterday morning I awoke <pb id="pg-13-169" n="13:169"/>at 5,&#x02014;miserable enough for a while; today again at 5, having sat up too till near one. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tout est dit</hi></foreign> [All is said]. I am not <hi rend="italic">radically</hi> ill, however, at all; I am radically even well. I sleep in the <hi rend="italic">east</hi> room, the one <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were in; and I am now writing there, about half past 7 by the clock, while my Mother makes breakfast in the other end of the edifice. Poor body, she slept today till 7, and makes a thousand apologies: her normal hour of awakening is my bitterest exceptional one, 5 o&#x02019;clock: I feel ashamed of myself when I hear her speak of it.</p>
<p>Tell Jack, when he calls, that she is well; that they are all as well as usual; that I have yet had no composure to write to him, but will soon.</p>
<p>The Annan people have elected Ewart, with considerable difficulty, with some rioting and <hi rend="italic">tarring</hi> of clothes.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Ewart (<date when="1798">1798</date>&#x02013;<date when="1869">1869</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9011"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370810-TC-JSM-01"><sic>9:277</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1837-08-10">10 Aug. 1837</date></corr></ref>. He defeated Sir Alexander Johnston for Dumfries Burghs, <date when="1841-07-02">2 July</date>, by 412 votes to 352, and held the seat till <date when="1868">1868</date>. The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Times</hi>, <date when="1841-07-05">5 July</date>, reported anti-tory violence in Annan, the burning of Sir Alexander in effigy, and the use of tarred swabs to assault voters. J. J. Hope Johnstone (<ref target="volume-08/lt-18350128-TC-AC-01"><sic>8:19</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1835-01-28">28 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>) was elected for Dumfries County. TC&#x02019;s brother-in-law, James Aitken, in Dumfries, voted for Ewart.</note> A pretty prize they have got.</p>
<p>Has Harriet written to you? Write you to me,&#x02014;as indeed I daresay this very morning you will, like a good <foreign>lassie</foreign>! And so blessings on your early cup of coffee for you, poor little thing, and be good, and let us meet soon!</p>

<p>I began to look for a letter on Saturday morning&#x02014; You had told me it would not be possible till Monday&#x02014;but no matter for that; I looked for it all the same! Accordingly I found it dreadfully long of coming&#x02014; But at least it was &#x0201C;all right,&#x0201D;&#x02014;when it did come. You had emerged alive out of the horrible Steam boat&#x02014;had prospered at Tynemouth&#x02014;and had a prospect of some Christian com-<hi rend="italic">fort</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251114-JBW-MAC-01"><sic>3:412&#x02013;13</sic><corr>JBW to MAC, <date when="1825-11-14">14 Nov. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> in shape of breakfast!&#x02014;and on Wednesday god willing I shall hear something definitive&#x02014;and then make all the haste I can to wind up here: for sitting <foreign><hi rend="italic">in meditatione fuge</hi></foreign><supplied>[?]</supplied> [meditating flight] is a sort of sitting that yields no rest either to body or soul&#x02014;&#x02014;</p>
<p>Poor Harriet she seems quite enraptu<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed with your visit I have <pb id="pg-13-170" n="13:170"/>a letter from her this morning which I would send;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Martineau wrote, <date when="1841-07-04">4 July</date>: &#x0201C;I had seen all manner of good things in him before; but what he was in good Spirits I never had witnessed,&#x02014;nor imagined. O! he was so light &#x00026; gay! He had given all his cares to the winds on his voyage, I suppose; for he seemed to have no more troubles than a school-boy. &#x02026; For my part, I took plenty of opium, in order thoroughly to enjoy the day &#x02026; &#x00026; this ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (opium time again) I know it will all come back again, &#x00026; I shall enjoy it all a second time. He seemed so pleased with the place, &#x00026; praised our clear blue sea so warmly, that I wanted him to send for you at once. &#x02026; The London Steamer passes before my window, &#x00026; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> bring books &#x00026; friends. &#x02026; We are within 20 minutes of Newcastle, where every thing may be had. &#x02026; And he says you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to come. &#x02026; But how changed all is by his being happy! His kindness &#x00026; sympathy are always eminent, in his darkest times,&#x02014;as much so as his truth; but how far better they are when he is gay! &#x02026; And you too, dear friend, sending me that pretty handkerchief.&#x0201D; She also told JWC that she was feeling better and hoped to have a rest from writing after finishing no. 4 of <hi rend="italic">The Playfellow: a Series of Tales</hi> (<date when="1841">1841</date>).</note> only I want to shew it first to Darwin&#x02014; Had Tynemouth been settled on from the beginning I should have thought it a feasabler scheme by far than a house for <hi rend="italic">a year</hi> at Annan&#x02014;but having entered practically on <hi rend="italic">that</hi> arrangement perhaps one should work it out, on the same principle that you finish a manuscript even when it displeases you&#x02014; How ever it goes; I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> see my Mother now, after the positive hopes I have given her&#x02014;but she could be got at, I suppose, with little difficulty from Tynemouth&#x02014; Darwin has be<supplied>[en]</supplied> sitting over maps of the north country for several days back and tell<supplied>[s]</supplied> me that <hi rend="italic">Anann</hi> and Tynemouth are &#x0201C;no distance at all&#x0201D;&#x02014;</p>
<p>Nothing has come for you since you went except the enclosed letter from Jane<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Carlyle Aitken had written, <date when="1841-06-28">28 June</date>, about the safe arrival of a money order.

Most of the letter was about the electoral nominations in Dumfries: &#x0201C;Nothing astir but canvassing &#x00026; electioneering tomorrow &#x02026; Sir A Johnston W Ewart Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x00026; our little sooty neighbour of Lovett Court A Wardrope Framesworth will be proposed as candidates!!!

<salute>Dear <foreign>Bairn</foreign>,</salute>
<p>Your good little Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1841-07-06">6 July</date>.</note> did lie waiting at Ecclefechan last night; the stupid Postmaster had forgotten to deliver it; only after we were gone did little Jane<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Welsh Carlyle (<date when="1831">1831</date>&#x02013;<date when="1884">84</date>), Alexander&#x02019;s da.</note> come tripping over with it (her <hi rend="italic">second</hi> journey that day); and Jamie and <supplied>[I]</supplied>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Omitted by TC.</note> returning in from a <foreign><hi rend="italic">gloaming</hi></foreign> ramble over the fields, found it lying here. You are always good and punctual; you always write, too, a pleasant Letter, let the news be what they may.&#x02014; As to &#x0201C;Paper,&#x0201D; pray break into that of Fraser&#x02019;s; part of it was intended for you!</p>
<p>Last night did not bring a sleep either, but only promised that one was coming. Let us be content; thankful for the stillness, greenness, bright sun or <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> of bright sun; and piously ask what of clearness we can muster. This morning I have written to engage the Cabin Cottage for one month, beginning on the <date when="1841-07-26">26<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of july</date> (Monday come a fortnight) the first vacant time for it. Isabella,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle, James&#x02019;s wife.</note> who has lived in a <pb id="pg-13-173" n="13:173"/>room of the place, represents to me that I have somewhat exaggerated its extreme littleness; its comfort and completeness, she says, is great: there was either that or no supportable house in this region; for Johnston&#x02019;s of Shawhill was of the nature of <hi rend="italic">rooms</hi> in another person&#x02019;s house; and I learned that there lived on the other side of a wall within thirty yards a family of Middlebie Laird&#x02019;s people,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnston of Shawhill and Middlebie Laird unidentified.</note> the most distinguished basest gossips known even in this quarter; a circumstance which was at once final. We are to go to this solitary cabin, then; which you must not dislike too much! Our mother, or Isabella and her child,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the youngest, Tom.</note> can occasionally come and take advantage of the spare beds; there is a round-faced handy little woman, with whom Ellen I think will do very well, who will look after all supernumeraries, &#x0201C;take care of the horse,&#x0201D; go errands &#x00026;c: for four weeks we shall decidedly contrive to do! After that, Chelsea or Tynemouth, Quimperle<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rio had hoped to persuade the Carlyles to visit him in Brittany. In his letter of [<date when="1841-06-14">14? June</date>] he said, &#x0201C;have you made up your mind about the journey to Brittany? &#x02026; When my wife comes, we must absolutely meet some way or other; I hope her eloquence will succeed better than mine in persuading you that it is a wiser plan to cross the water than to stay here cursing the wind and damning the Queen&#x02019;s eyes&#x02014;&#x0201D;</note> itself, any place is accessible. You will have time to see your Mother in the interim. I suppose Ellen must go with you thither. You send her by Steam from Liverpool; an omnibus for Dumfries receives her at Annan, and then (next morning I think) a second coach for 2/6 sets her down at Templand. You clip out the Steamers Advertisement from the next <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Newspaper:</hi> that will tell you the days and hours. So much for Ellen.</p>
<p>As for yourself, you know the way now; for there is now nothing to bring,&#x02014;nothing but as many Literature-of-Desperation Books as will serve me four weeks: I shall evidently get no work done if it be not reading and riding. Consult Mazzini. Catch what you can in the London Library or by borrowing; I suppose that will be enough; for I grow dreadfully weary of it, and think it doubtful if I shall now bite at the &#x0201C;Article&#x0201D; for some time yet; and plenty of other books are here. I am writing on another bit of paper a list of some little things I want you to bring.&#x02014; As for your money, if you have any anxieties, give it to John and he will send it by the City Banker&#x02019;s to James Aitken&#x02019;s care at Dumfries.</p>
<p>And now what day will you come? As soon as you like and can! Monday first, Tuesday, Wednesday? Look in the Dumfries Advertisement, and see what day answers for the steam. Arrived in Liverpool, <pb id="pg-13-174" n="13:174"/>write to me; I will meet you with the Gig at Ecclefechan, Annan or even Carlisle. At Carlisle, I believe, there is apt to be some possibility of a kind of <foreign>hank</foreign>[entanglement] about getting right on by the Mail, if there be too many applicants. The Steamer cabin is now 12/; but in the fairest weather I do not advise you to try such a rig again.&#x02014; And so, Ducky, is not this all? Your next Letter will say on what day you are coming. I ought to add as <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nota Bene</hi></foreign> [Mark well] that this Newby Cottage is not yet absolutely <hi rend="italic">got;</hi> it is only offered for; and the man may let it to another, if any other apply for it on a longer lease than ours. But that I do not reckon likely.</p>
<p>And now, <foreign>adieu</foreign>, and no words more, but start to pack! I wish I had seen Sterling<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had thought that Sterling was coming to London. He wrote to her, <date when="1841-07-06">6 July</date>: &#x0201C;I enclose a few words for Carlyle not knowing how to direct them, &#x00026; hoping that you may still be in London. It is a doom to me that you are both going away so far &#x00026; is more like the long separations of death beds than anything in this life.&#x0201D;</note> and Cavaignac. Is there no hope of Cavaignac&#x02019;s staying till I return? Give my regrets and remembrances to both, in your kindest style.&#x02014; I too should not care if they printed Mazzini&#x02019;s Article: the <foreign><hi rend="italic">sentiment collectif</hi></foreign> is certainly not alive in me,&#x02014;for I have never found any but charlatans more or less decided, and egoists, and heretical fanatics, to make any <hi rend="italic">collectivity</hi> out of in these days; with none of whom <hi rend="italic">could</hi> a poor man like me <hi rend="italic">collect</hi> or unite! Give my kind remembrances to poor Giuseppe nevertheless: I love him in spite of all his &#x0201C;Progress of the Species,&#x0201D; and <foreign>Lamennais</foreign> &#x0201C;small beer struck with lightning&#x0201D;!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note></p>
<p>You may tell Darwin the distance from Tynemouth to Annan by miles is some 87; by hours is some 6&#xBD;, a sixty of the miles being railway ones.</p>
<p>Enough now. I have John to write to, and Jean.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Jane has doubtless communicated my history to you, as it arrived at Chelsea; how Newington House would not do at all; how hardly anything promised to do; and now today how I have taken a cottage of Slater&#x02019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> furnished and ready, at Newby,&#x02014;a lonely-standing, dainty but extremely small kind of Bathing Mansion, for four weeks beginning in a fortnight hence. That was the best I could do. If the man Slater refuse me, I shall not even have done that! But I expect he will accept. We shall be fairly out of Annan; shall have a horse, sea-bathing of a sort; and be in the middle of all our friends, who, my Mother among them, may come in succession, and bathe beside us there. After a month we can stay longer or go anywhither. The rent is two guineas a week. I am very glad to have it settled any way.</p>
<p>My voyage after I parted from you was in the highest degree monotonous, silent, <hi rend="italic">grey-weathered</hi> outwardly and inwardly; a kind of stagnation or almost annihiliation<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS. For Harriet Martineau&#x02019;s description of TC&#x02019;s happiness after the voyage, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410706-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1841-07-06">6 July</date>]</ref>.</note> of one&#x02019;s whole being for two days; which perhaps was useful too. On the Friday and Saturday I surveyed Tyndale from the very mouth of the river to its source,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC exaggerates. He took several walks in Tynemouth, <date when="1841-07-02">Fri., 2 July</date>; and his railway journey to Carlisle, <date when="1841-07-03">3 July</date>, followed the course of the Tyne to WNW of Hexham and of the S Tyne to Haltwhistle.</note> and found it an interesting country; the more so as nothing but what was rather pleasant befel me there. The people I observe are, properly speaking, <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi>, and their dialect as well as the features of their countenance are pure Annandale: the Scotch of Roxburghshire,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scottish border county bounded by Dumfriesshire, Cumberland, and Northumberland.</note> &#x00026;c.; which curiously enough, meets another sort of <hi rend="italic">Western</hi> Scotch, precisely about Dumfries, or at Dodbeck between Annan and Dumfries!</p>
<p>Our good Mother is well here again, as they all are, in a tolerable degree. Jamie&#x02019;s Boy alone still suffers from illhealth;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom, who d. <date when="1841-12-27">27 Dec.</date></note> but is considered to be growing better. Alick has gone over to Liverpool yesterday, not to be back till Tuesday; in quest of merchandise goods &#x00026;c: he seems to be going on fully better than when we last saw him. &#x02026;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellipsis in typescript. The passage omitted may have referred to Robert Hanning&#x02019;s financial difficulties; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410728-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1841-07-28">28 July</date></ref>.</note></p>

<salute>dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>You are dreaming perhaps that I am gone away without sending the address&#x02014;but no fear of that, or perhaps I should rather say, no <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> of it! The fact is I am still here, feeling more like a Gohst that cannot get itself <hi rend="italic">laid</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline</hi> 4.2.</note> than anything else in prose or verse! I begin to be ashamed of showing my face even to the unknown persons who pass me by in the streets&#x02014; I fancy them all saying to themselves &#x0201C;Chirst Almighty! what is that woman still doing above ground?&#x0201D; What indeed but waiting for the crowing of the cock!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 1.1.</note>&#x02014; and no cock will <pb id="pg-13-177" n="13:177"/>crow! &#x0201C;Did you ever know anything in the least like it?&#x0201D; (as my good Mother says).&#x02014; He went according to the programme, and since his arrival has written me three letters, each promising that the next should contain &#x0201C;some thing definite,&#x0201D; and the whole three proceeding in a rapidly increasing ratio towards &#x0201C;confusion worse confounded&#x0201D;&#x02014; Today&#x02019;s beats the world! If you only read it you would not know whether to laugh or cry over it!&#x02014;five pages of infinitismal details about houses issuing like one of our friend Oliver&#x02019;s parliamentary speeches in simple <hi rend="italic">zero!</hi> &#x0201C;And now,&#x0201D; he says, &#x0201C;comes the practical question what are <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi> to do?&#x0201D; God knows! unless I set about getting a divorce, and marry again, some man with <hi rend="italic">common sense</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">Genius!</hi></p>
<p>Perhaps&#x02014;indeed positively&#x02014;if he do not forbid&#x02014; I will cut the matter short at once, by putting myself and my maid on the Railway next week and going straight to the Mother that bore me&#x02014;some thirty miles <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> that <hi rend="italic">Annan</hi> of his&#x02014;having placed <hi rend="italic">her</hi> in safe keeping, for she cannot be trusted in her own&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">you remember!</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster had just missed coming to dinner on the night Helen had been drunk; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401016-JWC-JF-01"><sic>12:287</sic><corr>JWC to JF, <date when="1840-10-16">16 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x02014;I could then join this much-agitated <hi rend="italic">Calebs in search of a house</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

Schiller, <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Tell</hi> 3.1.</note> and <hi rend="italic">this</hi> man considers <hi rend="italic">everything</hi> and some things more&#x02014;</p>

<p>I am glad you have conceived better thoughts of the cabin&#x02014; The devil will be in it, or in us surely, if we cannot contrive to be comfortable <supplied>[in]</supplied> it for all the time&#x02014;and then as you say we can go to Tynemouth or to Brittany even&#x02014;to be sure we <hi rend="italic">can</hi>&#x02014;or to Kamtschatka even if we <hi rend="italic">will!</hi>&#x02014; So now the business is to get under way&#x02014; No Dumfries newspaper has been sent to me last week&#x02014;but I looked in the former one and found the sailing days were Monday and Thursday I suppose they are the same for all weeks&#x02014; To profit by Thursday&#x02019;s we should need to be in Liverpool on Wednesday<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1841-07-14">14 July</date>.</note>&#x02014;and I shall not be ready to start so soon&#x02014;by hurrying I might get all done that is to do&#x02014;but there are reasons besides what is <hi rend="italic">to do</hi>&#x02014;purely <hi rend="italic">feminine</hi> reasons&#x02014;connected less with <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> than with <hi rend="italic">suffering</hi>, which make it necessary for me to delay my travelling till the end of the week.

<p>I wish I could bring myself to go by the steamboat also&#x02014;it would be so much cheaper and so much less trouble for all parties&#x02014;but for the present I shudder at the idea of it&#x02014;it is such torture&#x02014;and then arriving among ones friends nearly defunct&#x02014;and needing two or three weeks to get refitted again!&#x02014; On the whole I believe it is better not to&#x02014;</p>

<salute>Dear Goodikin,</salute>
<p>Your little Letter which came last night answered quite as well as the larger one at that date could have done: the larger one today, after my second letter; that will be a <hi rend="italic">better</hi> plan.</p>
<p>You will find now that I have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> the Cabin Cottage, inclosed today is the man&#x02019;s letter. Four weeks of the thing cannot beat us. If it <pb id="pg-13-180" n="13:180"/>prove extremely disagreeable, we shall rejoice the more that we were not doomed to it for three months.</p>
<p>I find you have sent <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the Dumfries Paper; I therefore clip out the Steam Advertisements. They may still find you on monday. Dumfries will be a rather better place for Ellen<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Mitchell.</note> than Annan: she might in that way escape passing a night on the road to Templand: na<supplied>[y]</supplied> perhaps she may walk on foot, in case of extremity; it is but 13&#xBD; miles. The coach leaves Dumfries (I think) some time about 8 every morning. The Steamer from Liverpool by Dumfries will take at least about Twelve hours.&#x02014; It is little matter which way.</p>
<p>The address of the place we settle in for our month is Newby Cottage (I suppose) or &#x0201C;Newby, Annan N.B.&#x0201D;&#x02014; Till the <date when="1841-07-26">26<hi rend="italic">th</hi> next</date> (<date when="1841-07-24">24<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> at London), Scotsbrig, or Templand)</p>
<p>They are waiting for me to go off with this for the day mail. It is <hi rend="italic">sacrament</hi> at Ecclefechan. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu, adieu!</foreign> Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your courteous and obliging Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Accepting TC&#x02019;s offer of an article; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410621-TC-MN-01">TC to MN, <date when="1841-06-21">21 June</date></ref>.</note> reached me before I left Town. For the last fortnight I have been wandering to and fro; and could not till a few days ago make any definite reply.</p>
<p>Arriving here, I find myself disappointed of the House I had counted on occupying, in this native region of mine, till winter; find myself disappointed of several things;&#x02014;and on the whole not likely to continue here much longer than a month; but again to wander, and to spend my summer season differently from what I had expected. One of the things that fall to the ground in consequence is that project of an Article on the present aspects of Poetic Literature in France. It returns, alas, to the state of a hope or wish; and cannot, I fear, become a fact, for the present! You must pardon me for having troubled you with it. My excuse is that of Melbourne on the Corn Laws;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to Melbourne&#x02019;s paraphrase, <date when="1841-05-03">3 May</date> (in defense of his change of policy on the Corn Laws), of his own speech, <date when="1840-06-11">11 June 1840</date>, to the House of Lords: &#x0201C;I do not mean to pledge myself to the continuance of the existing laws &#x02026; This is a question of circumstance; because circumstances connected with the state of the country, considerations of various kinds &#x02026; may arise, which would not only justify, but would render it necessary to pursue, a different course.&#x0201D;</note> that of <pb id="pg-13-181" n="13:181"/>many men in the like circumstance: &#x02018;Sons of Time,&#x02019; and subjects more or less of Chance which Time brings!&#x02014;</p>
<p>If I ever do write the Article, if it do not die in the mere condition of a wish, as so much does with us, I will offer it to you; and have you and your terms and capabilities in view while writing it.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many thanks for the past, many wishes for the future,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Well, dear Mrs Stanley,</salute> what was the final issue of the Poll?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stanley was defeated; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410706-TC-HMS-01">TC to HMS, <date when="1841-07-06">6 July</date></ref>.</note> You do not tell me; tho&#x02019; it must have decided itself on Thursday last. Perhaps you did not understand that I was still here. Or am I to infer from the Manchester Newspaper itself that all went as it should have done?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently Mrs. Stanley had sent him the newspaper for which he had asked, <date when="1841-07-06">6 July</date>.</note> Pray indicate to me, by some word or sign.</p>
<p>You had truly all the talent on your side, and by much the better half of the right,&#x02014;such right as was going! Indeed, if the poor Tories did not mean, in some obscure way, something far other and better than anything they can articulately speak or propose, their existence in the world at present would be a kind of insult to mankind. Their Corn-Law, considering what they have now become, and what England has now become, is perhaps the fatallest-looking platitude any class of mortals utters in our day. It goes on the tacit hypothesis that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> created all this land of England; that we, twenty-six million lacklands, are to be very thankful if they will let us bring wheat out of it on any terms whatever! They force every thinking soul in this Empire to ask himself, <hi rend="italic">Did</hi> they create it? The fatallest of all questions, as matters stand; which should never be asked at all till the inevitable latest moment!&#x02014; If any Peel or body of Peels can find that course ultimately <pb id="pg-13-182" n="13:182"/>prosper with them, they will have outdone all gods and devils. No: they may beat people in County Elections; but they cannot beat the Laws of Nature; these, I bet, will prove too hard for them.&#x02014;</p>
<p>&#x02014;Meanwhile, it seems the Hon. Mrs Stanley and her Ladies sat in the Jury Box, wearing her Husband&#x02019;s colours; apparently even more interested than he. You then, I find, retired to the front of the Court House and sat in open carriages. The Editor asserts that for beauty and grace, nothing could be admirabler. This also I can partly believe,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; it would have been as satisfactory perhaps had one been there and seen!&#x02014; Pray tell me, at any rate, what the result of Thursday was.</p>
<p>As for me, I am here till the <date when="1841-07-26">26<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> of this current month; I then withdraw for four weeks of bathing to a little crib of a Cottage, in a lonely part of the beach of the Solway Frith; the designation of it, &#x0201C;Newby, Annan, N.B.&#x0201D; The noble Cumberland mountains lie in front, divided from one by the multitudinous elegiac music of the everlasting Sea. I am to walk silent there; uttering hardly any word;&#x02014;meditating for the good of mankind; especially for the sanity of my own poor soul. My Wife with her maid is to be there; all other creatures, remote. The Steeple of the place where I got my Schooling is within view; but nothing worth conversing with except the Sea only.</p>
<p>After those four weeks, which bring us towards the <date when="1841-08">end of August</date>, my history again becomes indistinct: prophecy utters nothing, or only this, that I then vanish &#x0201C;into unknown space,&#x0201D; and shall probably have reappeared at Chelsea a good while before you turn thitherward again.</p>
<p>And so <foreign>adieu</foreign>, dear Mrs Stanley. Good be with you all among the woods of Alderley. Tell me in any way how this Election has gone, and I will not trouble you with another syllable for six months or more.</p>

<p>I am to be off at last god willing on Friday morning by the eleven oclock train! I have stupidly neglected to ascertain the hour of arrival in Liverpool&#x02014;but Alick<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen&#x02019;s brother.</note> can perhaps do it without difficulty and if anybody will come to meet me <foreign><hi rend="italic">tant mieux</hi></foreign> [so much the better]&#x02014; Only <pb id="pg-13-183" n="13:183"/>do not <hi rend="italic">plague</hi> yourself to do so as you know like the bad sixpence I always turn up&#x02014;</p>
<p>If I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> turn up on Friday comfort yourself by thinking that nothing has prevented me except only death or a bad headach.&#x02014; And tell so to a certain young lady of <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi>&#x02014;who will probably inquire for me at your house on Saturday, giving her name <hi rend="italic">Geraldine</hi> Jewsbury.&#x02014; Whereupon she will infallibly shed many tears, and go away &#x0201C;heavy and displeased.&#x0201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; source unknown.

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1841-07-06">6 July</date>, addressed to Cheyne Row and forwarded by JWC.</note> reached me here last night; welcome, as all your Letters to me are. It is a long while since I have had a word from you; the hope that we might meet before I left Town came also, like many other hopes, to nothing. Pray write a little oftener,&#x02014;especially while I am here, and have leisure and composure for answering! Today you must be content with very little; a very little will not be without importance to you.</p>
<p>Know then that you have been radically misinformed as to my withdrawing hitherward at present; that your friendly sorrow at parting <pb id="pg-13-184" n="13:184"/>with me may straightway console itself again!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had written: &#x0201C;Just as the waves had abated &#x00026; the wreck of my household [by workmen] was nearly repaired came the disastrous news that you had positively migrated to Scotland once and for all. Little as I could hope to see of you even had you continued in London I have heard nothing for a long time that sounded more truly grievous.&#x0201D;</note> I have no thought of quitting London altogether, in the actual state of matters; I never had any thought, only vague rebellious impulses, blind longings and <foreign><hi rend="italic">velliet&#xE9;s</hi></foreign> [<foreign><hi rend="italic">vell&#xE9;it&#xE9;s:</hi></foreign> impulses]. I do not think I shall leave London for a while yet! I might readily go farther and fare worse; indeed in no other corner of the Earth have I ever been able to get any kind of reasonable social existence at all; everywhere else I have been a kind of exceptional anomalous anonymous product of Nature,&#x02014;provoked and provoking in a very foolish unprofitable way. Till once I feel ready for absolute solitude, which is not yet my case, I do not see where I could rationally hope to repay myself for what I should leave if I left London.</p>
<p>One fearful drawback there is: the thinness of the animal&#x02019;s skin, the sad unavoidable effect of London on his health! I am ill in all places, but a measurable degree worse always in London. What then? After infinite confused strugglings and deliberatings, I seem to have made out little more than this, That I cannot live all the year round in London;&#x02014;that I must, at this mature age, alter the whole habit of my existence, and become annually a locomotive animal; fly into the country in summer time, as other Cockneys do! One still house for all months of the year: this I cannot have in London; I must give up this, or give up London;&#x02014;it begins now to appear to me that I ought to be a good boy, and handsomely agree to do <hi rend="italic">the former,</hi> as so many other mortals do.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; With regard to Annan our project never was to stay longer than a few months there: a mere chance, offering some likelihood of a house that might suit well, induced me to turn thitherward, instead of bending towards Sussex, Wales, or any of the other azimuths: and accordingly here I am. The house however does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> turn out to suit well, or to suit at all; after various searchings, not without difficulty, I have at last found a Bathing Cottage not far off which we are to take possession of in a week, for the month of <date when="1841-08">August</date>, thereafter to set out again on our Travels if we like; and this is all the settlement in Annandale hitherto.

No, I tell you; there are others that I know of perhaps very considerably uglier. Besides if you will but take care of yourself, if you will learn that great art as you will have to learn it, the &#x0201C;uncertainty&#x0201D; will amazingly diminish; you will find a very handsome modicum of faculty still left at your own disposal. Believe all this, for it is true. One other aphorism I will give for comfort to you on another head, that of &#x0201C;Idleness.&#x0201D; Do you call the wheatfield idle on all days except when men are reaping wheat from it?

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I owe you a few words this morning, before the people go off to the Preaching: there is but half an hour to work on, they tell me; wherefore I must be brief.</p>
<p>&#x02026; Our dear Mother is very brisk and active here; makes me breakfast, and bustles about, with great alacrity; fully as well as one could expect at her years. The weather till two days ago has been continally showery; my mackintosh and white hat are valuable, an independent panoply against such evils: nay an occasional wetting is worth enduring for a sight now and then of the great elemental rain-laboratory, shower answering to shower, all rivers, brooks and seas from Tyndal Fell and the streams of Northumberland onward to St. Bees Head and the edge of Ayrshire,&#x02014;all playing with one another:</p>
<p>Criffel his cap hath got</p>
<p>And Skiddaw wots full weel of that!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial. Criffel, a granite hill ridge, in SE Kirkcudbrightshire, faced Skiddaw across the Solway Firth.</note></p>
<p>However we have now dry times, and today is one of the noblest of summer days. Old Jamie Ritchie was hounding his cattle when I went out at eight o&#x02019;clock to smoke my pipe at the house-end; poor old Ritchie, near 90 years of age, &#x0201C;thy servant&#x02019;s business still about cattle,&#x0201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 46:34. James Ritchie is not identified further.</note> rejoicing still to see with his old eyes the young foals of this year frisking in the summer sun. The day before yesterday I rode (on a rough kind of Shelty) round by the Gair, Springkell and Langshaw.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Springkell and Langshaw were houses nr. Kirtlebridge ca. 2 mi. apart.</note> The world is all green as an emerald, a beautiful promise ligible<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Typescript reads &#x0201C;ligible.&#x0201D;</note> on the old Earth. The <hi rend="italic">authentic</hi> rusticity of everything is good; the <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> of everything especially is what I hardly dare believe in,&#x02014;till I reflect that in very deed it is silent, and there will be no noise of Cockneys, but the fields all belong to the grasshoppers and me. Yesterday I blackened our Mother&#x02019;s Peathouse with an effectual coat of coaltar! She had provided the liquid, good provident woman, but could get nobody to put it on; nobody understood it: Jamie and I with an old firebrush soon smeared it on, to the wonder of all! &#x02026;</p>
<p>Alick and Jenny<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Typist had inserted &#x0201C;(Mrs. A. Carlyle).&#x0201D;</note> drove off on a jaunt to Dumfries on the Fast-day<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Observed on a weekday before Sacrament Sun.</note> <pb id="pg-13-188" n="13:188"/>last week;&#x02014;the one clear holiday they have in the year &#x02026; They have given me <hi rend="italic">two</hi> half hours, or I should never have got so far! Here they are now however.&#x02014; Where Jane is today I can only guess. At Liverpool most probably. May be here perhaps on Tuesday or so <foreign>Adieu</foreign>. Here is Mother with a candle; with many &#x0201C;kind regards and loves to you.&#x0201D;</p>

<p>Thanks, <foreign>Bonny Bairn</foreign>, thousand thanks for the Letter. I was threatening to get seriously uneasy. &#x0201C;Never in my life did I know Jane behave so unpunctually: not one word, tho&#x02019; words now go for a penny!&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had probably reached Liverpool on Fri.; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410710-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [ca. <date when="1841-07-10">10 July</date>]</ref>.</note> I was about to write myself this day, had there no Letter come, at latest in the evening: but Alick and I settled yesterday that he was to have a messenger in readiness at <hi rend="italic">each</hi> post; and so here is your Name-sake Jane, a most wise little <foreign>Lassie</foreign>,&#x02014;and all is right. Be a better <foreign>Bairn</foreign> for the time to come, or&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014;!&#x02014;</p>
<p>I am by no means sure that you have done wisely in undertaking to come by the Steamboat. The temptation was indeed considerable; and the last agony is two years old now. You have good weather, the best of the year as I will hope; and with the bed on deck, and Helen to watch you, it must be risked now. Cannot you take a thimbleful of brandy? It is a great resource for some. Take care also what dinner you eat; no sloppy article. Heaven guide you! I will be on the pier at the hour (so soon as I have learnt it); I will have the Gig, and whisk you up to Templand that day. We will find some resting-place at Annan, or go on to Mary&#x02019;s,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Gill, nr. Annan.</note>&#x02014;kind always, tho&#x02019; at present the houses being a-rebuilding she lives in a <hi rend="italic">barn,</hi> I believe! As for Hellen, it has struck me might it not be as well to leave her at the Cottage, with some work that would serve her <hi rend="italic">till Monday next?</hi> The likelihood is that there will be some kind of vacant bed-closet procurable for her there, and she would have the ground investigated, the house all clean &#x00026;c for our arrival. I think I will go and look after that tomorrow: we can do as we like when we meet. An omnibus goes to Dumfries; the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> I now <pb id="pg-13-189" n="13:189"/>find is fully as convenient even for Dumfries as the Nithsdale is. If we had Ellen (<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the way to spell her, is it not?)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen or Ellen Mitchell.</note>&#x02014;if we had Ellen put up, we can travel ourselves at our own rate. It is but for four days; I rather think the Cottage, if there be room, will be the place.&#x02014; Have you some <hi rend="italic">small</hi> thing (bag, or my little portmanteau, or even <hi rend="italic">both</hi> then, but <hi rend="italic">no more</hi>) for going into the Gig: it holds very little. And this is all I can recollect to counsel you about.</p>
<p>Much good may Liverpool do you, or rather have done you, for it will be the last day when you get this. Had I known the Paulet was so superior a character I ought certainly to have gone and looked at her!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This was JWC&#x02019;s first meeting with Elizabeth Paulet, eldest da. of the renowned Wesleyan Methodist preacher Robert Newton (<date when="1780">1780</date>&#x02013;<date when="1854">1854</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20066"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), m., <date when="1832">1832</date>, to Mark Etienne Paulet (d. <date when="1850-05-20">20 May 1850</date>), apparently a Swiss businessman, of Charles Imer, Paulet &#x00026; Co., 11 Dale St., Liverpool, said to be consul there. She was the sister of Emma Newton, author of two pious novels, <hi rend="italic">Difficulties of a Young Clergyman in Times of Division</hi> (<date when="1844">1844</date>) and <hi rend="italic">The Modern Unbeliever</hi> (<date when="1847">1847</date>) which was dedicated by name to their parents. The Paulets lived at Seaforth House, Seaforth, 4 mi. NNW of Liverpool, a large mansion built in <date when="1813">1813</date> by John Gladstone, father of the future prime minister; he left in <date when="1830">1830</date>. Now demolished, it was rented by the Paulets by <date when="1834">1834</date>. The <date when="1841">1841</date> census shows that their family was Charles (age 11), Julia (10) and Frank (4); they had five female and two male servants, and three other people were living there at the time. Not much is known about her and her circle (though it included A. H. Clough and Emerson on his <date when="1847">1847</date>&#x02013;<date when="1848">48</date> visit and later) apart from the JWC/Jewsbury correspondence, but she was evidently attractive, intelligent, a strong feminist, intensely concerned with undogmatic religion, and (in later years at least) a passionate supporter of Italian independence. Much about her can be inferred from her novel <hi rend="italic">Dharma; or Three Phases of Love</hi> (<date when="1865">1865</date>), the epigraph to which begins, &#x0201C;&#x02018;The history of ideas is the only true history.&#x02019;&#x0201D;</note> But I do not believe she is equal to the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi>-faced,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henrietta Maria Stanley.</note>&#x02014;not Moon-faced, as only the profane Darwin calls her; not she. By the bye, here is a Letter from <hi rend="italic">her</hi> this morning; I wrote to ask about their election; then saw in the Newspaper that they had <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> it, whereupon I wrote again to say she need not write:&#x02014;this is the upshot. Burn it, and speak nothing of it in that Cheshire neighbourhood.&#x02014; &#x02014;I should on the whole like best of all to see poor Geraldine: an ardent spark of Life, struggling and striving, one knows not whitherward too well! May the bounteous Heavens be good to her, poor Geraldine. I wish she could once get it fairly into her head and heart that neither &#x0201C;woman&#x0201D; nor man nor any kind of creature in this universe was born for the exclusion or even for the chief purpose of falling in love, or being fallen in love with! Good Heavens, it is <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the purposes most living creatures are produced for; but except the zoophytes and coral insects of the Pacific ocean, I am acquainted with no creature (except George Sand too, and <pb id="pg-13-190" n="13:190"/>the Literature of Desperation) with whom it is the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> or grand object! That object altogether missed, thwarted, and seized by the Devil, there remain for man, for woman and all creatures (except the zoophyte), a very great number of other objects, over which we will still shew fight against the Devil! Ah me, these are sorry times, these of ours, for a young woman of genius. My friend Herr Mone (whom I am reading here) greatly prefers the old deep Norse Paganism, with its stalwart energy and self-help, with its stoicism, rugged nobleness, and depth as of very death, to any Christianism now going!&#x02014; Recommend me to Geraldine at any rate, as one who love her, and will lament sore if she gain not victory, if she find not by and by some doctrine better than George-Sandism,&#x02014;inclusive of G-Sandism and <hi rend="italic">suppressive</hi> of that.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The debate about George Sand went on between TC and Jewsbury; but (while acknowledging that he had a rational point of view) it would be wrong to suppose that Jewsbury&#x02019;s enthusiasm was nothing but a weakness for romantic &#x0201C;love.&#x0201D; Nor was it &#x0201C;phallus worship.&#x0201D; Espinasse gives another picture, admitting that it was notorious that TC usually spoke of Sand as &#x0201C;distinguished&#x0201D; only by &#x0201C;a lax treatment of&#x0201D; sex. But he repeats a story of G. H. Lewes&#x02019;s that he once found TC &#x0201C;with some of George Sand&#x02019;s books &#x02026; confessing that he had broken down in an attempt to indite a scathing invective against her and them. &#x02018;There is something Goethian about that woman,&#x02019;&#x0201D; he told Lewes, &#x0201C;as an excuse for his failure.&#x0201D; TC also surprisingly said that she was &#x0201C;shrewd&#x0201D; (Espinasse 223&#x02013;24). For an explanation of Sand&#x02019;s importance, see, for example, Patricia Thomson, <hi rend="italic">George Sand and the Victorians</hi>, especially ch. 2, &#x0201C;&#x02018;George Sandism&#x02019; in Cheyne Row&#x0201D; (<date when="1977">1977</date>), though even this may under-estimate her importance to women such as JWC, Jewsbury and Elizabeth Paulet in helping them to value themselves and present their point of view. She had broken the implied contract between the sexes. Already she must have been discussed with her and the Carlyles&#x02019; friend Godefroid Cavaignac, Mazzini (who was to present Sand with a copy of <hi rend="italic">Zoe</hi>), Milnes and many more.</note> Enough now.</p>
<p>Not a word in the shape of news can stand here. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Je fais le mort</hi></foreign> [I sham death]; I live in a <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> unequalled for many years; I grow daily better, am really very considerably recovered now. My popularity is suffering somewhat by the absolute refusal to see any body whatever. I let it suffer.</p>
<p>Harriet Martineau answered me; upon the whole I had better send <hi rend="italic">her</hi> Letter than the Stanley&#x02019;s, which contains nothing except &#x0201C;kindest remembrances to Mrs Carlyle.&#x0201D;</p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Letter;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >[<date when="1841-07-12">12 July</date>], from the grand jury room, York courthouse, sent to TC in London.</note> for your kind remembrances of me in the Court-house of York. Pontefract too has a Court-house, as you say; an ancient solid-minded wry-necked Dragon, imperturbable amid cockatrice Roebucks and the sinners of the Riding; on leather seats sits many a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Custos rotulorum</hi></foreign>,&#x02014;sits a bright bevy of Fryston friends; ushers distribute Letters on long poles; poor old Barney, with eyes wide-staring in terror, &#x0201C;sowld him a bit o&#x02019; hay,&#x0201D; but will not perjure himself:&#x02014;all this, and what surrounds it, stands in very lively memory with me too.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410409-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1841-04-09">10[9] April</date></ref>. The <foreign><hi rend="italic">custos rotulorum</hi></foreign> is the principal justice of the peace in a county, in whose care are the records or rolls of the session.</note></p>
<p>For a fortnight and a day I have been here, in the uttermost extreme of seclusion; sunk in <foreign><hi rend="italic">Naturanschauung</hi></foreign> [contemplation of nature], deep as a Druid; sunk in reflexions that cannot be spoken, in indolence that need not be spoken! It is very wholesome for me. Like a &#x0201C;chapped flute&#x0201D; (or scrannel-pipe) which you steep in the ditch till it close again, and become a whole flute or scrannel.&#x02014; I spent about a week in coming hither, by Newcastle &#x00026;c. At Tynemouth I had a swim <pb id="pg-13-192" n="13:192"/>in the beautiful blue Sea; saw Harriet Martineau, saw the North Shields Election;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The election for Tynemouth and North Shields when Henry Metcalfe, liberal, was elected.</note> admired the rugged energy of that population, and how completely Annandale Scotch they are! From the Humber to the Forth, still more from the Tyne to the Forth, I find no real distinction at all,&#x02014;except what John Knox introduced: it is all Scotland Scotch in features of face, in character, in dialect of speech;&#x02014;you too, if you behave yourself, shall be accounted Scotch! They are all Danes, these people, stalwart Normans: terrible Sea-Kings are now terrible Drainers of Morasses, terrible spinners of yarn, coal-borers, removers of mountains; &#x0201C;a people terrible from the beginning.&#x0201D; The windy Celts of <hi rend="italic">Gall</hi>oway<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Gall</hi> derives from &#x0201C;Gael,&#x0201D; meaning Celt.</note> meet us, not many miles from this, on the edge of Nithsdale: is it not a considerable blessing to have escaped being born a Celt?</p>
<p>As to poor Harriet (who asked for you among other things), I found her confined to a sofa; dangerously ill, I believe, tho&#x02019; not in immediate danger; for the rest, brisk, alert, invincible as ever. There is a kind of prompt completeness in Harriet which does honour to Nature and the Socinian Formula. In my travels I have met with few more valiant women. Poor Harriet, she was absolutely affecting, amiable, almost sublime to me there. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sunt lachrymae rerum</hi></foreign> [There are tears for human affairs].<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> 1:462.</note> How are all human souls crushed in by this Formula or that, by this bad fortune or that,&#x02014;and hardly any Formula supportably fits a man, and the most are not coats but strait-waistcoats; very lamentable!

<p>How can you ask me back to Fryston, when the smoke of my tobacco is hardly yet cleared from that sublime bedroom?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes had invited him for the <date when="1841-08">first two weeks of Aug.</date> Thackeray had just been at Fryston with W. Frederick Pollock, who described their welcome by Milnes and his father, &#x0201C;standing at the door, the latter in a dressing-gown and smoking a cigar. He at once &#x02026; gave one to each of us, and added, &#x02018;You may smoke anywhere in this house&#x02014;in your bedrooms, if you please&#x02014;and Mrs. Milnes does not mind it in her drawing-room. Only you must not smoke in Richard&#x02019;s room, for he doesn&#x02019;t like it&#x02019;&#x0201D; (Sir Frederick Pollock, <hi rend="italic">Personal Remembrances</hi> [<date when="1887">1887</date>] 1:177).</note> I must not think of it again yet, for indefinite periods of time. Meanwhile surely I hold all things there in the liveliest remembrance: whosoever is interested <pb id="pg-13-193" n="13:193"/>in that most important fact ought to be apprised of it, on occasion. From valet Frederick up to the Lord of the Manor and Lady of the Manor, I can make an embossed image of it all, at any time, and be very glad to contemplate it all. Good be at Fryston always.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I go to catch my Wife from the Steamer at Annan; carry her up to Nithsdale, her Mother&#x02019;s country, for a few days: after that we proceed to take possession of a certain small furnished Cottage, situated apart in solitude and sea-gravel, on the North beach of the Solway,&#x02014;to bathe there, and be altogether silent there or nearly so, for about the space of one calendar month. Skiddaw is right in front, with Helvellyn and his everlasting brothers; St Bees Head, the broad water, and Criffel and Caerlaverock<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A ruined castle nr. the mouth of the Nith, 7 mi.

This life of wandering is infinitely discordant with me, with all old habits of mine. Nevertheless it now seems inevitable. I believe on the whole I must by and by endeavour to procure myself some kind of permanent hut, or inverted tub, somewhere or other under the free canopy in this soil of Britain, that I may fly thither at any time out of Babylon, when it is like to kill me. I grudge to leave London altogether; yet cannot afford to be killed by it just yet.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>Have you not observed in the household Gods, of late days, a certain air of tender melancholy? even as tho&#x02019; they compassionated you for you knew not what! as tho they saw some black doom overhead which they doubted their power to shield you from! And has not your heart, so elastic in general, been weighed down with presentiments of evil? Ah! if it have not been so; there is none of that supernatural sympathy betwixt us which is the characteristic of a genuine <hi rend="italic">&#x0201C;eternal friendship&#x0201D;!</hi> If you have not <hi rend="italic">feared</hi> for me in these days, you have not <hi rend="italic">cared</hi> for me. For in these days my life has been beset with perils&#x02014;the shadow of which, must have fallen dark over the soul of any one to whom I was really dear.</p>
<p>Seriously, I have come thro sad things since we parted&#x02014;have had motion and emotion enough to bring on <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, had not my <pb id="pg-13-196" n="13:196"/>moral power of resistance been stronger than my physical&#x02014;and besides I have twice over narrowly escaped a violent death&#x02014; But I will begin at the beginning, and tell you my whole travel&#x02019;s history;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> 1.3.</note> that you may rightly estimate the mercy of my being quite alive&#x02014;alive and writing to you!&#x02014;</p>
<p>The first half of my journey&#x02014;that is, the railway part from London to Liverpool, was hardly more laborious than one of my Omnibus-excursions, on blue-devil-days, from Chelsea to Milend<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mile End, in E London, beyond Bethnal Green, nr. Bow.</note>&#x02014; But at Liverpool, where I staid three days to <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> in the house of my Uncle, I found myself unexpectedly laid hold of by a blind Destiny, and forcibly made a Lion of!! I was not the Rose but I had been near the rose<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201C;<foreign>Je ne suis pas la rose, mais j&#x02019;ai v&#xE9;cu avec elle.</foreign>&#x0201D; Attrib. to Henri Benjamin Constant (<date when="1797">1797</date>&#x02013;<date when="1830">1830</date>).</note>&#x02014;and in that mercantile City <hi rend="italic">roses</hi> being a decided rarity they are ready to fall into raptures even over the rosified clay! It was very irksome not to be allowed a simple moment for being &#x0201C;as ugly and stupid and disagreeable as I pleased&#x0201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.

A very dashing Lady,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified, though possibly Mrs. Paulet.</note> one of that sort of people born to write a book on &#x0201C;the rights of women&#x0201D; carried me off in her carriage one day <foreign><hi rend="italic">par vive force</hi></foreign> [by main force],<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380909-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:170</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1838-09-09">9 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> so to speak&#x02014;the horses were <hi rend="italic">dashing</hi> as well as their mistress&#x02014;they also seemed born to maintain <hi rend="italic">the rights of horses</hi>&#x02014;and at the top of a steep Hill called Mount <hi rend="small-caps">pleasant</hi>, they commenced a violent protest, and appeal to posterity&#x02014;reared, plunged, played the Devil, finally got both coachman and reins among their feet and were rushing down with us into a <foreign><hi rend="italic">grand peut &#xEA;tre</hi></foreign> [great perhaps]<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Attrib. to Rabelais; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380918-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:180</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1838-09-18">18 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> when mercifully a gentleman dashed forward and seized their heads at the risk of his life&#x02014; One of them bolted up into the air, then kissed its mother-earth and while Horse, Coachman, and our gallant deliverer were all lying in a heap, we terrified women scrambled out as cleverly as we could.

What makes this man&#x02019;s action the more heroic, is that he had not youth to inspire him&#x02014;he is a man about fifty&#x02014;in delicate health, with a <pb id="pg-13-197" n="13:197"/>large family of children&#x02014;a clergyman but <hi rend="italic">suspect</hi>&#x02014;as unorthodox and democratical&#x02014; God bless him!

<p>From Liverpool I came to <hi rend="italic">Annan</hi> by Steamboat after all! Performing the rest of my journey by Mail&#x02014;and separating myself from Helen and the luggage was going to have proved a very expensive piece of self-indulgence, besides causing a world of trouble to other people&#x02014;so I resolved after a severe struggle to make myself a victim&#x02014;and a victim I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> sure enough! For a few minutes, just till we got out into the deep sea, I flattered myself I was going to have rather a <hi rend="italic">sublime</hi> night of it&#x02014; To give myself the best chance of escaping the old agonies; I had a matrass spread for me on deck, and stretched myself there to pass the night in the cool air&#x02014;with the &#x0201C;starry vault,&#x0201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Common saying.</note> as they call it right over head&#x02014;the dark waters plashing round&#x02014;nothing alive beside me except the man at the helm&#x02014;but all too soon my poetic feeling gave place to one of the most desperate prose&#x02014;and this night like all others I have passed at sea, was one long <hi rend="italic">conscious</hi> fainting-fit&#x02014;even the occasional torrents of rain which poured down on me could not revive me out of this horrible state&#x02014;surely to Heaven if I keep my senses I will never sail again&#x02014; &#x0201C;When he gets you,&#x0201D; said my Helen in the morning with a curious mixture of <foreign>pathos</foreign> and rage, &#x0201C;I think it will but be picking up a dead dog&#x0201D;!

<salute>My dear Jeannie,</salute>
<p>Here is your second Note; for which, as well as for the other, many thanks You do not say whether you got mine or not; but I conclude there is no doubt.</p>
<p>Today, ever since 3 in the morning, I am decidedly out of order (<hi rend="italic">Castor</hi> in me &#x00026;c, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> any effect,&#x02014;a bad outlook for this night!)&#x02014;and for anything I can yet see it may chance to prove rather a bad business for me, that of driving even to Dumfries and back again. Especially as there is, at bottom, no need of it. If you do not see me on arriving at Dumfries, you have only to continue in the same Coach some eleven miles farther, and be set down &#x0201C;at the Flosh Toll-bar,&#x0201D; or rather a hundred yards beyond it, which is Austins <foreign><hi rend="italic">yett</hi></foreign> [gate]: there, if able to crawl I will be, or if not I some to receive you, and the Gig to Newby will be in readiness. It seems clearly the best place. Your Coach stops about a quarter of an hour at the King&#x02019;s Arms Inn: during this interval if you do not <hi rend="italic">dine</hi> with the others as is very unlikely you may run over to Jean&#x02019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken&#x02019;s.</note> and explain why I am not there.&#x02014; To avoid all uncertainty, I will conclude by undertaking <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be at Dumfries: so you may engage from Thornhill at once all the way to &#x0201C;the Flosh Bar&#x0201D; (7 miles on this side of Annan), and then there will be no anxiety about your &#x0201C;place&#x0201D; &#x00026;c at Dumfries.</p>
<p>If by some unexpected chance (bad headache &#x00026;c) you should even fail us on Monday, I will go to Newby myself,&#x02014;very desolate, I do suppose,&#x02014;and on Tuesday (the hour is about 4&#xBD; p.m. I believe) there will again be I and a Gig at Austin&#x02019;s for you,&#x02014;or 100 yards beyond that same Flosh Bar above spoken of. The name of Austin&#x02019;s farm is <hi rend="italic">Gill</hi> (hard <hi rend="italic">g</hi>). Is not this enough?</p>
<p>Writing is making me horribly sick; I have had one of the ugliest days, but passed it happily all alone,&#x02014;and done less mischief than usual.</p>
<p>Good night, poor Goody. You will come <hi rend="italic">on Monday</hi> now, in spite of that unexampled toleration I give you? Good night.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Before setting out for an evening walk, the only walk I have schemed for myself today, I will write you a little word, to go up with the &#x0201C;woman to Annan.&#x0201D; I would have written to you earlier in the day; but we had not a <hi rend="italic">drop of ink in the house;</hi> and had to wait till we went to Annan and bought some!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Wullie</hi>, whome<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS. Wullie not further identified, but possibly a herdsman at Scotsbrig (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18290331-TC-HI-01"><sic>5:14</sic><corr>TC to HI, <date when="1829-03-31">31 March 1829</date></corr></ref>).</note> we met last night just on arriving, would inform you, I hope, that we were all here safe, Jane well, and I very much improved by my drive. It sputtered and rained upon me all the way to the Gill, but without doing me the slightest mischief; I arrived some time before 3 o&#x02019;clock; Mary fried me my bit of mutton, which made an excellent dinner for me; then Austin came home &#x0201C;from the Moss&#x0201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peat bog; specifically the part of the moor where tenants had the right to cut peats.</note> had discharged his peats, and was just looking over the world with me, a little, from his stack-yard, when the coach came in sight, and we making all speed towards the Toll-bar found the Goodwife getting out, and all right. Her Letter and Jean&#x02019;s Letter had both gone duly. Mary made us tea, and so about 7 o&#x02019;clock the journey happily ended.&#x02014; Your trunk was <hi rend="italic">left</hi>, partly by mistake; but on the whole it makes no matter, for there is nothing like a chest of drawers here. Isabella&#x02019;s things were all duly set out; her milk jar yielded excellent coffee-cream this morning; but I think they had put it in an impure bowl, for tonight the rich cup of cream proved all sour, and even the milk sour;&#x02014;so that we had to wait till &#x0201C;the Woman&#x0201D; ran over to the Farmer&#x02019;s, and there got a supply. We are to have threepence worth a-day from the same place (it is close by), or as much more as we like.</p>
<p>This is a dainty little house; but in wan<supplied>[t]</supplied> of several things. We have this day been at Annan buying&#x02014;a tin kettle, two pairs of 4-penny snuffers, a horse-comb and curry-comb; with a piece of mutton, a small stock of candles,&#x02014;for last night there was hardly one in the house: in short, we are getting a start made in housekeeping, and shall do bravely straightway.&#x02014; Our good Alick&#x02019;s Gift stood all ranked in the press. I am really <hi rend="italic">vexed</hi> that he should go to such expense, yet much touched by his affection, poor fellow: Jane drew one of her bottles of Sherry today, and found it right generous liquid: I <hi rend="italic">supped</hi> on the brandy last night, and got a very wholesome refection from it. I slept <pb id="pg-13-200" n="13:200"/>very sound till half past five or later; tonight I expect to be still better off, for all day I have felt much healthier, and mean to do myself good still by a walk. It is the quietest place, this, I ever in my life was in, at present. Nothing heard or seen all day but the grey morning sea;&#x02014;solitary (for the rough wind keeps all people at home) as if we were on the coast of New Zealand. We shall do very well, I believe.</p>
<p>But the best news, dear Mother, is that we propose driving up to you on <hi rend="italic">Friday first</hi>. We will come <hi rend="italic">to Tea</hi> (if the day is not bad), may perhaps arrive long before tea, but shall need <hi rend="italic">no dinner</hi> (and <hi rend="italic">will have none</hi>, remember!); then drive off again in good time:&#x02014;all this if the weather be good. If <hi rend="italic">not</hi> good, then the engagement stands for <hi rend="italic">next</hi> day. But we are to see Jamie on Thursday, are we not? Tell him our dinner-hour is 4 o&#x02019;clock, and that he ought to be smart and punctual!</p>
<p>There will be excellent bathing here about Monday or earlier; the whole of this garret room where I now write is vacant absolutely: either you or else Isabella and Tom must get ready to come down forthwith,&#x02014;that the thing be not thrown away. This is fixed.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your short Note was lying duly for me at Alick&#x02019;s, as I returned, in a rather disastrous manner, from escorting Jane up to Templand, a week ago all but a day. Jane had left Liverpool on the Tuesday after you saw her (Tuesday gone a week); deciding, not very wisely I believe, to come by the Steamer with Ellen, after all: Jamie and I were duly at Annan to meet them; they arrived sick but recovering; Jamie took charge of Ellen along to the Cottage here, I drove off with Jane towards Dumfries and Templand, purposing to stay with her there till the Monday came. Templand was already crammed with Liverpool guests; our bed was <hi rend="italic">six inches too short;</hi> I had slept ill for two nights before, and Jane for one night had not slept at all: the result was, there could no wink of sleep be had there for me, and very few winks for poor Jane: wherefore, about three in the morning, I <pb id="pg-13-201" n="13:201"/>arose, packed up my bag, yoked my Gig, and drove off again towards Dumfries and Scotsbrig, thro&#x02019; the blessed dawn. All was hanging wet as a sponge, the Nith running red and swoln,&#x02014;various <hi rend="italic">Herons</hi> fishing in it; who, with the Thornhill Post and myself, seemed the only terrestrial labourers awake at that hour. At Dumfries I contrived to get some hours of sleep; and reached Ecclefechan, in such mood as you understand. It was there and then that I found that Letter of yours.</p>
<p>My news since amount to the simple fact that I have been considerably out of order, below par a good way in point of health, and am not righted even now; but that on Monday I did succeed in meeting Jane at the Flosh Toll-bar, and getting hither in the evening, and am now decidedly in the way of being righted. That Templand Expedition was not the cause of my illness, I think, but rather the accelerator of it merely; I know not whether it is the new <hi rend="italic">milky</hi> diet of Scotsbrig, or what it is, but this new biliousness of mine is not of the old sort at all, but a totally opposite one, as if, according to my guess, there were now not too much bile in me, but too little or next to none at all! Am I not a pretty oscillating character? This wretched body of mine is really all but too great a burden to be borne.&#x02014; Happily Jane is rather in good heart, and I contrive to keep myself very quiet.</p>
<p>This same &#x0201C;furnished cottage&#x0201D; is a considerable curiosity of a place; of the tiniest dimensions, as if space here on this beach had been not less precious than in the heart of London; but it is papered, dry, well-carpentered, and free from smoke; by her contrivances, by the purchase of some small odds and ends, Jane is making it all very habitable. Already this morning at nine I had a bathe: the tide is not ten yards off; I ran out wrapt from sheer nakedness in my dressing-gown; flung off the gown, and laid a stone on the top of it, then plunged in, one plunge and no second. I had a pair of old shoes on my feet, which some six or eight years ago were yours. Jane had coffee ready when I came in. Our friends, good hearts, are perfectly affecting by their kindness, by their true wish to help us. Poor Alick had a gift standing here of a half-a-dozen of Port and Sherry for Jane, a bottle of good brandy and one of whisky for me, &#x00026;c &#x00026;c: I could almost weep over it, yet I am very glad of it. Mary had her girl over here with a little bottle of cream, with offers about peats, coals, and I know not what: we are to drive over thither this afternoon. Tomorrow (Thursday) Jamie of Scotsbrig is expected as he returns from Annan market; next day we make a flying call at Scotsbrig: there are two beds and a snug little garret (where I now write, looking out towards Cumberland, or rather the <hi rend="italic">shroud</hi> of Cumberland) which either my Mother or Isabella, or both of them together, are to come and take <pb id="pg-13-202" n="13:202"/>possession of about Monday, when the tides will be prime. Yesterday we drove only into Annan, for the wind was a tempest there; bought groceries from Jamie Ewart, bought <hi rend="italic">snuffers</hi>, wafers, ink, and a whole miscellany of &#x0201C;Bath bricks and <hi rend="italic">other combustibles&#x0201D;:</hi> I put most of my cash into Nelson&#x02019;s Bank; saw Nelson himself, looking old, sourish, saddish and embarrassed; spoke to no other but to him and Ewart, and the vender of ink. Such is our history here,&#x02014;if you add Books enough, M&#xfc;her&#x02019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified; reading uncertain.</note> &#x00026;c, and tobacco enough.</p>
<p>It is the <hi rend="italic">loneliest</hi> place surely I could have found anywhere in the world, this, at present. Sky and Sea, with little change either of sound or colour (for all <hi rend="italic">day</hi> yesterday it was but half light)&#x02014;such is our whole environment. Very strange, very sad yet very soothing, is this multitudinous everlasting moan of the Frith of the <hi rend="italic">Selgovae</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Roman name for British tribe inhabiting parts of Dumfriesshire and Galloway.</note> vexed by its winds; swinging in here and again out, like a huge pendulum hung upon the Moon, ever, <hi rend="italic">ever</hi>, as in the days of Plinius<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either Gaius Plinius Secundus (<date when="0023">23</date>&#x02013;<date when="0079">79</date>) or Gaius Plinius Caecilius (ca. <date when="0061">61</date>&#x02013;ca. <date when="0112">112</date>), Roman scholars.</note> and far earlier! Eternity is long, is great; and Life, with all its grievances and glories and other &#x0201C;trash, trash,&#x0201D; is very short and small.&#x02014; Last night, about nine, I walked round by Water-foot: on the top of the knoll there, they have now got a lighthouse; I was looking up as I passed, and there at that instant the sputter of some lucifer, or kindled wick, disclosed within few feet of me a red bristly Annandale face, busy in getting the lamp lit;&#x02014;I met no other living thing on my round all the way by Milnfield to Newby again. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sehr Gut</hi></foreign> [Very good]!</p>
<p>Mary <hi rend="italic">has</hi> now got her &#xa3;20; Jane brought it down with her from Dumfries: all safe, and accepted with infinite gratitude. The like is one of your chief luxuries. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was to write and tell you. Has Jenny ever written? I believe her to be very unhappy just now; I believe Rob not to be <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>, but be ruined, not to have any money, never to have had any, but to ha<supplied>[ve]</supplied> been a liar from the beginning. Your Note meanwhile has availed him well: he has ceased <hi rend="italic">horse dealing</hi>, appears to be thinking seriously <foreign><hi rend="italic">Que faire</hi></foreign> [What to do]?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had written to TC, <date when="1841-07-10">10 July</date>: &#x0201C;I have written to Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Hanning, &#x00026; also a little note to poor Jenny. Monomania not unfrequently begins in such a way, as that of the foolish speaking you describe. Jenny must take the firmest ground she can poor thing, &#x00026; let her feel that we will all stand by her. I perfectly agree with you that a note from me, requesting repayment of the money, was necessary &#x00026; may be useful.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Lest you chance to have the trouble of a fruitless journey to Chelsea, and so be discouraged from coming back, I had as well apprise you straightway that your loyal-minded, welcome little Note finds me not there but here,&#x02014;on the Scotch shore of the Solway Frith; I might say, on the very beach, amid rough sea-grass and gravel; remote from all haunts of articulate-speaking men; conversing with a few sea-mews alone, with the ocean-tides and gray moaning winds! I have fled hither for a few weeks of utter solitude, donothingism and sea-bathing; such as promised to prove salutary for me in the mood I was getting into. London in the long run would surely drive one mad, if it did not kill one first. Yearly it becomes more apparent to me that, as man &#x0201C;was not made to be alone,&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 2:18.</note> so he <hi rend="italic">was</hi> made to be occasionally altogether alone,&#x02014;or else a foolish sounding-board of a man, no <hi rend="italic">voice</hi> in him, but only distracted and distracting multiplicities of echoes and hearsays; a very miserable and very foolish kind of object!</p>
<p>My Wife is here too, with her maid; a wondrous little cabin of a &#x0201C;furnished cottage,&#x0201D; built as if expressly for us, has been discovered here; a savage of the neighbourhood even takes charge of a horse; Annan a sufficient little Burgh stands but two miles off, and yet our place is lonely (owing to its ugliness), lonely as if it were on the coast of Madagascar;&#x02014;a place altogether as if made for us! Thank God, there are still some places <hi rend="italic">ugly</hi>, if that is the price of their loneliness!&#x02014; We are to continue here for some four weeks yet; and do not count certainly on Cheyne Row again till the last hope of sunshine, perhaps in the <date when="1841-09">end of September</date>, have abandoned us for this year. Pray observe the date; and let us hope we may actually see you then.</p>
<p>The spirit you profess is of the best and truest: perhaps one man only, yourself only, could do much more for you than I who can do nothing, but only say with all my heart, Good Speed! Doubt it not at <pb id="pg-13-204" n="13:204"/>all, you will prosper exactly according to your <hi rend="italic">true</hi> quantity of effort,&#x02014;and I take it you already understand that among the &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">true</hi> quantities of effort&#x0201D; there are many, very many which the &#x0201C;public,&#x0201D; reading or other, can simply know nothing of whatever, and must consider as falsities and idlenesses, if it did. But the everlasting Heart of Nature does know them, as I say; and will truly respond to them, if not today or tomorrow, then some day after tomorrow and for many and all coming days. Courage!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Browning needed the boost; his <hi rend="italic">Sordello</hi> had met with all but universal disfavor and his <hi rend="italic">Pippa Passes</hi> (<date when="1841">1841</date>) had fared little better.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I bethink me that you may as well send for at least <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> yards of of that fine plaid cloth: I shall need a waistcoat at any rate as well as breeches and perhaps a dressing-gown.</p>
<p>You may also send us five yards of your <hi rend="italic">diaper</hi> towelling (on Monday), 2 lbs of your mould-candles, and for me 2 quarter-pounds of tobacco. Have them all ready wrapt in the morning.</p>
<p>Farther, as our tide is about noon, and we are very <hi rend="italic">slow</hi> here, I think it will be better if <hi rend="italic">Jamie</hi> undertake to bring down Isabella and our Mother; trusting to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> they would be in danger of missing their bathe for Monday, which would be a pity. I can drive my Mother home again if she do not consent to stay. Pray be punctual about this; punctual, Boy!</p>
<p>We got nicely home last night; I have had a good sleep and am yet but half dressed from my bathe. Jane&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">wound</hi> is better;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had hurt her ankle on some rocks on the seashore.</note> she complains a little of headache, but will soon be better I hope.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>. There is not a moment to spare. I must walk with this to Annan myself.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>This is the second letter you get from me today; perhaps they will be both delivered at once tomorrow, tho&#x02019; the first is at Ecclefechan already. Before going to bed, whither all the rest have already gone, I will send you a small message about a small plan of mine for Tuesday; the weather is so fine that I have formed a small plan today.</p>
<p>The Nag being again in order, our time here short, and the tides good, it seems to me I might be up at Scotsbrig on Tuesday morning about half past nine, to take breakfast with my Mother and Jenny, and then bring my Mother down with me still in time to have a bathe here; for the tide will not be till about one. If my Mother would consent to stay here, there is plenty of room for her; and perhaps Jenny would not dislike at all to be left alone altogether to her own reflexions just now. Or even if my Mother <hi rend="italic">would</hi> go back, reason or none, we could contrive to humour that too: for instance you could come riding down on the Poney, and manage it.&#x02014; In short, if my Mother will consent, and the weather prove fair, I think I will come up that morning. Will you accordingly go over on Monday night, and ask her. If she say <hi rend="italic">Yes</hi>, I will take your silence for assent. If <hi rend="italic">No</hi>, you can write me a half-word in time for Postie&#x02014;?&#x02014; No, hang it! You cannot possibly write to catch me on Tuesday morning: I bethink me of this even now! Well, I will come at any rate on those terms, <hi rend="italic">if the morning be fair</hi>. You can tell my Mother that, and do what you can to have her ready.</p>
<p>Furthermore I will bring up my new erroneous trowsers, and if I could contrive that I should see Garthwaite<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom or his brother John, Ecclefechan tailors. See Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 2:142&#x02014; 43</note> at your house, I would try to instruct him what to do. The trowsers will not suit as they are, and it is a pity if they be spoiled for me. Try if you can bring Garthwaite to bear. If he be working in his own house that day (say, at the waistcoat &#x00026;c), it will be very easy. Enough I will come,&#x02014;on the above condition of the weather; which I hope will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be bad, tho&#x02019; as good as today we can hardly expect it to be! This has been one of the beautifullest of days; a blessing to feel the air visit one, the sun shine on one.</p>
<p>And so good night, dear Brother. Ah me, what tragedies and miseries one has to witness, and in one&#x02019;s turn to suffer! Endeavour to comfort <pb id="pg-13-206" n="13:206"/>poor Jenny, and to be useful to her. We will all assist her as we can: perhaps this affliction may in the end prove good and not evil.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About this time Robert and Janet Hanning temporarily separated, she going to stay with her mother at Scotsbrig and he remaining in Kirtlebridge. A longer separation was to occur in <date when="1841-09">Sept.</date> when he emigrated to Canada. She and the children joined him in <date when="1851">1851</date>.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>On this desolate strand of the Ocean flood, where the memory of all friends revives on one with new distinctness, your good Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated Falmouth, <date when="1841-07-23">23 July</date>.</note> was altogether welcome. Rowland&#x02019;s penny-postage too shall have some praise from us;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Penny Postage, started after the efforts of Rowland Hill (<date when="1795">1795</date>&#x02013;<sic><date when="1897">1897</date></sic><corr><date when="1879">1879</date></corr>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13299"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).</note> the one instance as yet, or one of the very few instances in which mankind have taken the full advantage of that same &#x0201C;crowded civilization,&#x0201D; from the over-crowded state of which they suffer so many miseries! Let no sacrilegious Peel lay hands on that.</p>
<p>We have been here now for a matter of ten days, and begin to get accustomed to singular life we have. Our house is a small dandified fantasticality of a Cottage, almost close upon the gravel of the beach; a foot path, on coarse downs, with gorse, broom, hairy imitation of grass, passes east and west before our windows; behind us is an oat-field now in ear, are fishers&#x02019; huts and cabins; right in front from this garret-window lies all Cumberland, lie Skiddaw, Helvellyn, and a thousand wondrous peaks, known to me from infancy;&#x02014;at the present moment, all blue and shining in the <date when="--08">August</date> Sun; oftenest sunk in grey tempest; always worth a look from me. The place is very strange; most <pb id="pg-13-207" n="13:207"/>lonely; for three days after our arrival we had no phenomenon at all, but the everlasting roar of loud winds, and the going and coming of the great Atlantic Brine, which rushes up and rushes down, once every twelve hours, since the Creation of the world,&#x02014;never forgetting <hi rend="italic">its</hi> work; a most huge, unfortunate-looking thing; doomed to a course of transcendent monotony, the very image as of a grey objectless Eternity; the sound of it like a sublime complaint against <foreign><hi rend="small-caps">ennui</hi></foreign> that had no end nor limits! To me all this is impressive enough; wholesome enough: it is solitude unbeautified by any Zimmermann,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the Zimmermann brothers who were all German landscape painters, August Albert (<date when="1808">1808</date>&#x02013;<date when="1888">88</date>), August Maximilian (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x02013;<date when="1878">78</date>), August Robert (<date when="1818">1818</date>&#x02013;<date when="1864">64</date>), and August Richard (<date when="1820">1820</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872">72</date>).</note> real solitude. For the rest, I bathe daily, ride often; drive my Wife, or my Mother who is with us in these days, to and fro in frail vehicles of the gig species. It is a savage existence for most part, not unlike that of gypsies;&#x02014;for example, our groom is a great thick-sided laughing-faced redhaired <hi rend="italic">woman;</hi> she comes to me, from time to time, with news of inextricable imbroglios in the harness, in the headstalls and hayrack; if I could not myself perform, the whole equine establishment would come to a stand-still. But none knows me, none ventures to know me; I roam far and wide in the character of ghost (a true <foreign><hi rend="italic">revenant</hi></foreign>): such gypseydom I often liken to the mud-bath your sick rhinoceros seeks out for himself, therein to lie soaking for a season; with infinite profit to the beast&#x02019;s health, they say!&#x02014; In three weeks or less this will probably be at an end. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Majora canamus</hi></foreign> [Let us sing a better song].<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Eclogues</hi> 4:1.</note>&#x02014;</p>
<p>What you say of Emerson is not entirely without some echo in myself:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had asked what TC was writing about Emerson in his pref. to the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> (see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410625-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1841-06-25">25 June</date></ref>): &#x0201C;There are in the original volume many (irreconcileable) contradictions, some trivialities, some empty absurdities. But we have hardly anything half as good in modern English. Coleridge could have written something like it though with deeper touches &#x00026; more system as well as more pedantry&#x02014;had not his outward difficulties combining with his inward timidity prevented him ever speaking out. Do you know if there is any procurable head of Emerson?&#x0201D;</note> accordingly I love his Book not for its detached opinions, not even for the scheme of the general world he has framed for himself, or any eminence of talent he has expressed that with: but simply because it is his own Book; because there is a tone of <hi rend="italic">veracity</hi>, an unmistakable air of its being <hi rend="italic">his</hi> (wheresoever he may have found, discovered, borrowed or begged it), and a real utterance of a human soul, not a mere echo of such. I consider it, in that sense, highly remarkable; rare, very rare, in these days of ours. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott</hi></foreign>, it is frightful to live among echoes! All that I have &#x0201C;done&#x0201D; for poor Ralph <pb id="pg-13-208" n="13:208"/>Waldo, accordingly, is to express that sentiment in a short and very crabbed Preface; and allow James Fraser to reprint the work for his own behoof and Waldo&#x02019;s (if for any one&#x02019;s behoof!) with that <foreign><hi rend="italic">imprimatur</hi></foreign> on it; which poor Fraser was most anxious to do, without further trouble of mine. The few that read the Book, I imagine, will get benefit of it. To America, I sometimes say, this Emerson such as he is seems to me like a kind of <hi rend="italic">new era:</hi> really in any country all sunk crown-deep in <hi rend="italic">Cant</hi>, Twaddle, and hollow Traditionality, is not the first man that will begin to speak the truth, <hi rend="italic">any</hi> truth, a new and newest era?&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; &#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; There is no likeness of the face of Emerson that I know of; I fancy he never yet was engraved: poor fellow, it lies among his liabilities, to be engraved yet, to become a sect-founder, and go partially to the Devil in several ways,&#x02014;all which may the kind Heavens forbid! What you ask about my likeness in the Exhibition is unanswerable: the thing belongs to one Lawrence, a young artist of great promise as yet all unripe; the thing, so frightful was it, and I suppose is it, shall forever belong to him!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had asked what was to become of TC&#x02019;s portrait by Laurence &#x0201C;which they call very good.&#x0201D; Samuel Laurence&#x02019;s portrait had been shown at the Royal Academy Exhibition since <date when="1841-05">early May</date>. TC had sat for a portrait in <date when="1841-03">March</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410321-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1841-03-21">21 March</date></ref>.</note> I likened it, four months ago when I struck work in <hi rend="italic">sitting</hi>, to a compound of the head of a Demon and of a Flayed Horse; <foreign><hi rend="italic">infandum</hi></foreign> [abominable], <foreign><hi rend="italic">infandum</hi></foreign>.</p>
<p>I am really anxious to see what you have made of Strafford.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had written about good progress on his tragedy saying he would like TC to read it when it had been copied.</note> But for Heaven&#x02019;s sake do have it copied into some entirely legible type of handwriting before you send it to me: in that amazing alphabet of yours, all like innumerable &#x0201C;pairs of spectacles&#x0201D; laid out in line (you careless fellow!), I can enjoy nothing. You shall have as faithful a verdict as I can give. You will know of yourself, my Friend, whether it is right or not; no other verdict is worth the hundredth part of one&#x02019;s own, if that be actually a verdict.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; My good Sterling, you have a beautiful talent in you; alas, it is such a business finding out what way to express that in!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had said: &#x0201C;every day it seems harder to write any thing really good: &#x00026; <hi rend="italic">slap-dash</hi> turns out to be the worst of Fetishes from which Inspiration might be looked for.&#x0201D;</note> You will find better and better, if you seek; that is all that can be said of any mortal. To our loud passionate questionings, What must I do? What must I do to be saved?&#x02014; there do come answers, right audible, tho&#x02019; in the smallest lowest voice, which one must listen to with open ear, with patient humble heart, or one will never <pb id="pg-13-209" n="13:209"/>hear them,&#x02014;more than the rest do. Courage: the battle is well worth fighting, if battle ever was!</p>
<p>God bless you, my man; I love you very well always. Remember me to Signor Hurricane the good Father and Thunderer if he is still near you. My wife would send her love to both of you; but is not here, is not well today, poor little woman. She has bathed but once, and, that time, hurt her ancle to lameness on an ugly stone of the beach. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>.</salute></closer></p>

Knight was not formally bankrupted though obviously having severe financial problems as Harriet Martineau wrote to Fanny Wedgwood: &#x0201C;My comfort under my supposed losses by poor Knight&#x02019;s failure was &#x02026; that I might rest.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Very probably a small word to you today will be worth a penny.</p>
<p>I received my <foreign>Dame</foreign> out of your hands at Flosh Bar, as appointed, and after a mouthful of Tea at Gill, came over hither [&#x02026;]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had traveled via Jean at Dumfries to Flosh Toll-bar, the nearest toll point to the Gill, ca. 11 mi. from Dumfries.</note> am back again into my usual state of health; my Mother is here since Monday, very well, and bathing daily: all the rest right except poor Jane only who fares very indifferently here. She slept badly, or hardly at all (as last night), lay one whole day in bed, &#x00026;c. She begins to consider that it is the breakdown after her journey; she having never till now got leave fairly to be at rest, and to break down. One thing was specially unlucky: she resolutely ventured out one of our first days into the tide here [&#x02026;] all suddenly took &#x0201C;the cow-sickness&#x0201D; &#x00026;c &#x00026;c; Isabella could not try it till next week.</p>
<p>You, I think, said you could not honour us with a visit at all; which <pb id="pg-13-210" n="13:210"/>seems to me a kind of pity. In this room our Mother and you with the child<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Thomas, Jean&#x02019;s youngest child, b. <date when="1841-02-06">6 Feb.</date></note> might have done, or might still do, very well; and the bathing here, <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> at all times, is very good when any tide is in.</p>
<p>We have tried the place for some nine or ten days now; and find it indeed very savage, no provision made for the wants of civilized man,&#x02014;not a drop of milk to be had, for one thing;&#x02014;but still an inhabitable place; and to me with its Gypsey life very solacing and wholesome. Our Gig nag has fallen utterly lame! His hoofs, not his shoes only, one of his hoofs had been unwell that day at Dumfries: the smith has now scraped out a large mass of suppuration from under the sole, and so the beast walks at large at Gill, shod for the present only with leather. We have a little shelty of Alick&#x02019;s, which at any rate is fully as handy.&#x02014; We have to drive up to the Gill for a can of new milk occasionally, and Mary occasionally sends down one with her eldest <foreign>Lassie</foreign>:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Austin (b. <date when="1831">1831</date>).</note> there is no other way of not going milkless here!&#x02014;they seem to me to be doing very well at Gill; and will be comfortabler than most people if they had their new house up, and the game fairly begun, we can hope.</p>
<p>Here is the Dr&#x02019;s last Letter. My Mother does not know I am writing to you, nor Jamie; else perhaps they would have messages! <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Sister. Commend me to James, to the two Jameses. <closer><salute>Yours ever,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>We were at Scotsbrig, and saw Jenny there, on Friday; she is quite well, seemed cheerful enough; but I suppose Rob&#x02019;s true destiny is yet undetermined. Some ugly work, I doubt, lies ripening there. <hi rend="italic">Silence</hi> of it, in the meanwhile!&#x02014;</p></ps>

<p>bathing: we led behind us a little Shelty of Alick&#x02019;s, equal, small as it is, both to gigging and riding; in the evening we <foreign><hi rend="italic">hipple dillied</hi></foreign> [limped slowly] again in the same style over to Gill; left the lame quadruped there at its home, and returned with the little Shelty, rather inexperienced in the reins, but <hi rend="italic">whirring</hi> along as for the King&#x02019;s Hundred, like a little &#x0201C;industrious flea,&#x0201D; being really altogether rapid, and a wonder for its size. In all these expeditions, my Mother alone accompanied me; Jane <pb id="pg-13-211" n="13:211"/>being in no case for a drive, and greatly disapproving of our conveyance besides. Yesterday I rode with the little Shelty to Newbrigg,&#x02014;silent, moist-green, curious for me to see; and in the beautiful evening we had to drive to Gill, <hi rend="italic">in quest of milk</hi>.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter with the Portrait of Merck has found me here.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Heinrich Merck (<date when="1741">1741</date>&#x02013;<date when="1791">91</date>), writer and critic; friend of Goethe, whose <hi rend="italic">G&#xF6;tz von Berlichingen</hi> he pbd. at his own expense, <date when="1773">1773</date>.</note> I have often heard of the sardonic Merck, have read some of his Letters; but never saw any likeness of his face before.

<p>It is not very clear to me what benefit my good wishes for your new international literary journal, the <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi>, can bring you:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >K&#xfc;nzel perhaps wanted to use TC&#x02019;s letter in a testimonial to support his plans for the pub. of <hi rend="italic">Britannia&#x02014;eine Wochenschrift f&#xfc;r englische Literatur und englische Gesamtleben</hi>, a weekly periodical to deal with English life and literature.

Such Enterprises may be conducted with all degrees of merit, with all degrees of faithfulness, openmindedness and insight; but with almost any degree, their tendency is sure to be useful. It will give me real pleasure to hear that you succeed.

<salute>Dear Mr Spedding,</salute>
<p>We look daily, from all our windows here, out at your Mountains, or the grey storm-veil of your mountains; and had been often thinking of you before your letter came.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A playful, flowery letter of <date when="1841-08-06">6 Aug.</date>, in which Spedding invited the Carlyles to visit him on their return to London. He wrote: &#x0201C;Whereas it hath reached our ears that &#x02026; Sartor Resartus has sought a brief refuge from Cocknies &#x00026; Cackle in a stone <foreign>tugurium</foreign> hard by Annan, whence all that calls itself the great world looks to him as turbid as the Sandy Frith waves. &#x02026; Let him reflect that Cumberl<hi rend="italic">d</hi> lies between him &#x00026; Chelsea yet, &#x00026; that the Nomadic Cockneyism of the Lakes will but graduate his descent upon Cockaigne, &#x00026; as it were break his fall, whereas an abrupt steam transit from the lone <foreign>tugurium</foreign> into the very bowels of Babylon were as bad as Jonah&#x02019;s leap from the stormy deck into the whale&#x02019;s belly.&#x0201D;</note> A visit from us, which depends on two parties, Destiny and Mortal men, is predetermined by one of these: we will hope that the other will not, as so often before, play us false! As proof that resolve is already passing into action; tho&#x02019; small action, learn that I have last night procured from Fraser of Regent Street a travelling map of Cumberland, significant I do believe of your very footpaths; with this I hope to drive and fare: to such length have we already gone. I fancied that I knew Helvellyn and Saddle-back <pb id="pg-13-213" n="13:213"/>here;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mountains nr. Keswick: Saddleback or Blencathra is ca. 4 mi. NE, and Helvellyn ca. 5 mi. SW.</note> this morning I try to confirm them by the new authority; but the light is never good: not once, for seven years, have I seen these beautifullest mountains of a right colour; sometimes about sunset they get to be, not of azure, but of a kind of mournful dirty bishop&#x02019;s-purple, which is their best; for which too I am thankful. Not a peak of them that is not rich with old memories for me; sad and beautiful as Life is, as Death is. On the whole, it is long since I have had so interesting a Dialogue with any of my Fellow-creatures as with this waste sandy ever-moaning Tide-flood of the Solway! A great, an ugly, inarticulate, lamentable but veracious kind of thing; with hoarse voice as from Eternity; of whose meaning there is no end. And my friends the Seamews, the Gulls and the Sandlarks&#x02014;not to say the Halve-net Fishers, and the two-and-thirty Winds of heaven, bringing cloud-fields and savage wind-music out of all lands under the Sky, and from the very Sky itself! Cockneydom shrinks all into the size of a worm-eaten walnut, and this whole existence of ours with its Peel-ministries and solar systems is worth little and worth much!&#x02014; Let us be thankful.&#x02014;</p>
<p>We quit this place precisely about the time of your return out of Yorkshire;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spedding had said that he would be visiting in Yorkshire till <date when="1841-08-23">23 Aug.</date></note> I think the very day before. We have then a visit of about a week to my Mother-in-law&#x02019;s &#x0201C;Templand, Thornhill, Dumfries&#x0201D;; after which,&#x02014;we think seriously of what is next to be done!</p>
<p>The great obstacle here is, getting across the Firth. At Wigton, I think you once said, we are but some 16 miles from you? From Wigton here we can scarcely be above 7 or 8; not above 15 even at Scotsbrig from which we should likeliest start. To go round by Carlisle is heart-breaking; to stay all night in an Inn,&#x02014;with the beautiful likelihood, among others, of not sleeping; of coming to you blear-eyed, shattered, half-distracted and undone! Some how or other we must manage to get on in a single day. It seems there is a man hereabouts, there are men, who will &#x0201C;guide&#x0201D; a bad old gig and quiet horse over to Bowness at low-water, and we ourselves can go at high-water and find it ready there. Do we come by Ireby after Wigton, or how? Some way or other we must actually try to come,&#x02014;and not waste our map, and so much else!</p>
<p>For the rest, pray let us have nobody at all, except the Colonial Secretary and what the ground naturally brings.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spedding had written: &#x0201C;For human fellowship, there <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> haply be some far enough from the Lion worshipping kind;&#x02014;Colonial Secretary [James Spedding (<date when="1808">1808</date>&#x02013;<date when="1881">81</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26090"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350800-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>8:196</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1835-08-13">13 Aug. 1835</date></corr></ref>] fallen back upon his principles, &#x00026; a Utilitarian or two from Leeds or Ulleswater beginning to suspect that the greatest happiness theory will not hold&#x02014; A few such upon reasonable notice might be assembled around the table of one who is grown tolerant of all manner of doctrines &#x00026; of Doctrinaires without losing hold of his own steadfast conviction that Heaven is above all yet, &#x00026; that the Crooked will in somebody&#x02019;s time be made straight, &#x00026; the rough places plain.&#x0201D;</note> We bargain for pot-luck <pb id="pg-13-214" n="13:214"/>in all senses; pot-luck, the Colonial Secretary and a little tobacco.

<p>On the whole if you let us hear from you the day after your return, it will be as speedy to address, &#x0201C;Scotsbrig, Ecclefechan&#x0201D; (Thornhill lies rather apart from Mail ways); I will answer shortly: we shall see better then what face Destiny makes.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Having half an hour to myself at present, I will write you again, tho&#x02019; it is but two days since my last sheet went off. It is the brightest, stillest Sunday; Isabella and Jane have gone out I know not whither; <pb id="pg-13-215" n="13:215"/>Ellen returns from Annan Kirk, with the false tidings, &#x0201C;There is no Post today, Sir&#x0201D;!&#x02014; The last intolerable volume of my Balzac <hi rend="italic">Lis dans la vall&#xE9;e</hi> is finished, and nothing farther of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Litt&#xE9;rature du d&#xE9;sespoir</hi></foreign> [Literature of Desperation]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Le Lys dans la Vall&#xE9;e</hi> (Paris, <date when="1836">1836</date>); also pbd. as <hi rend="italic">Le Lis dans la Vall&#xE9;e</hi> (Brussels, <date when="1836">1836</date>).</note> yet begun. The faint murmur of the declining Tide, and the chatter of many sea-birds are all the sounds I hear in this garret: over the sands Skiddaw, or rather the ghost of Skiddaw clad in mists and sunshine, is all I see.</p>
<p>&#x02026; Yesterday thro&#x02019; the dim dewy evening Isabella and I drove to Scotsbrig, by Hoddam Brig and the Howes. It is all like a kind of vision of Hades, this country, to me; especially when it sinks all <hi rend="italic">grey</hi>, like a formless blot; future and past alike nothing, or an unintelligible something! The truth is, I myself, in these weeks, make no debate whatever against the great exterior <hi rend="small-caps">not</hi>-I; there is nothing but passivity, idleness and Balzac Literature in me: perhaps it is good so; I shall get to working, to asserting of my <hi rend="italic">self</hi>, by and by. Never have I been idler than here since I can remember. If my health do not improve a little, it is very hard! I see nobody, will let nobody see me. &#x02018;It is not to be a Lion,&#x02019; Jane says, &#x02018;but to be a Tiger.&#x02019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The last two sentences are from Froude.</note></p>
<p>&#x02026; Did I ever tell you that John Johnstone (the Minister&#x02019;s Son), lately Minister at Glasgow, wrote to me since I came hither, for a recommendation or certificate for America, whither he was just bound, and has now, I suppose, sailed? I gave him the Certificate instantly. Poor John: the last account I got of him he was receiving &#x0201C;massive silver snuff-boxes,&#x0201D; now he is on his travels, an aged disappointed man.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x02019;s testimonial: &#x0201C;The Rev. John Johnstone, lately minister in Glasgow, now about removing to America, has been known to me, either directly by personal intercourse, or indirectly from the distance ever since my boyhood and his early youth. I clearly understand him to be a man of natural intelligence and faithfulness of character; a man of affectionate, graceful disposition, of good talent, usefully as well as gracefully cultivated; whose whole past life has been spent in honourable and well-accepted labour as a Christian minister; and whose repute among men, judging even by that strict standard, is without any flaw. To me he was a benefactor&#x02014;my first good instructor in the Latin language: his father was my father&#x02019;s venerated minister, and still dwells in my memory as one of the most venerable and truly Christian men I have ever seen in the world. If Mr Johnstone fail to do good in his new country, verily he will much differ from his parents and all their connections in this old one; for they, in piety, sobriety, and every modest virtue, were among the chosen of our Scotch people. My affectionate wishes and hopes go with him over the sea&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">United Presbyterian Magazine</hi> [<date when="1864-08">Aug. 1864</date>] n.s. 8:345&#x02013;46).

<p><salute>My dear Sir&#x02014;</salute>The Conference of Dissenting Ministers on the Corn-Laws at Manchester,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The conference was held, <date when="1841-08-17">17</date>&#x02013;<date when="1841-08-20">20 Aug.</date>, to discuss the Corn Laws and supply of food for the people. About 650 ministers attended to urge abolition of the Corn Laws and help for the unemployed.</note> is to begin to-morrow, if I remember rightly; it seems to me a matter rather more than usually remarkable. If any good account of it, such an account as might in some measure make one present at it, come out in any Newspaper, your own or another,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently Ballantyne moved from editing the <hi rend="italic">Bolton Free Press</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Liverpool Journal</hi> some time after <date when="1840-11">Nov. 1840</date>, where TC believed he was still; but Ballantyne wrote, <date when="1841-08-18">18 Aug.</date>, that he had been replaced by a former ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>. Reports of the conference were given in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1841-08-21">21</date> and <date when="1841-08-28">28 Aug.</date>; and probably the fullest account is in the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Times</hi>, <date when="1841-08-21">21 Aug.</date></note> I should be obliged to you if you would be so good as send it hither. The Dissenting Ministers, if they had due insight and faculty, have an immense task to discharge at present. Could they leave behind them as dreary and inane the things that have become a dreariness and an inanity, and discern the huge reality calling on them in these days to give it a voice, it were something! I fear they have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> faculty and insight; but I should like to see what it is they do. It seems pretty certain the Corn-Laws will have to terminate before long; but, alas, the business will only be beginning then. The dumb Poor have no voice; and must and will find a voice&#x02014;other than Rick-burnings, Gunpowder and Chartism!</p>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Two days ago your Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1841-07-31">31 July</date>.</note> direct from Liverpool, reached me here; only fifteen days after date on the other side of the Ocean: one of the swiftest messengers that have yet come from you. Steamers have been known to come, they say, in nine days. By and by we shall visibly be, what I always say we virtually are, members of neighbouring Parishes; paying continual visits to one another. What is to hinder huge London from being to universal Saxondom what small Mycale was to the Tribes of Greece,&#x02014;a place to hold your &#x03A0;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;-&#x0399;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;&#x1F31;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; [Panionia] in?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A gathering of all the Ionians at the temple on the mountain of Mycale.</note> A meeting of <hi rend="italic">All the English</hi> ought to be as good as one of All the Ionians;&#x02014;and as Homeric &#x0201C;equal ships&#x0201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> 1:306.</note> are to Bristol Steamers, so, or somewhat so, may New York and New Holland be to Ephesus and Crete, with their distances, relations, and <foreign>etceteras</foreign>!&#x02014; Few things on this Earth look to me greater than the Future of that Family of men.&#x02014;</p>
<p>It is some two months since I got into this region; my Wife followed me with her maid and equipments some five weeks ago. Newington Lodge,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where TC had asked Emerson, <date when="1841-06-25">25 June</date>, to write to him.</note> when I came to inspect it with eyes, proved to be too rough an undertaking: upholsterers, expense and confusion&#x02014;the Cynic<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Diogenes.</note> snarled, &#x0201C;Give me a whole Tub rather! I want nothing but shelter from the elements, and to be let alone of all men.&#x0201D; After a little groping, this little furnished Cottage, close by the beach of the Solway Frith, was got hold of: here we have been, in absolute seclusion, for a month,&#x02014;no company but the corn-fields and the everlasting sands and brine; mountains, and thousand-voiced memories on all hands, sending their regards to one, from the distance. Daily (sometimes even nightly!) I have swashed about in the sea; I have been perfectly idle, at least <pb id="pg-13-218" n="13:218"/>inarticulate; I fancy I feel myself considerably sounder of body and of mind. Deeply do I agree with you in the great unfathomable meaning of a colloquy with the dumb Ocean, with the dumb Earth, and their eloquence! A Legislator would prescribe some weeks of this annually as a religious duty for all mortals, if he could. A Legislator will prescribe it for himself, since he can! You too have been at Nantasket;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written: &#x0201C;Do you not believe that the fields and woods have their proper virtue, and that there are good and great things which will not be spoken in the city.&#x0201D; Emerson had been at Nantasket, ca. 10 mi. SE of Boston, &#x0201C;to sit by the sea and inhale its air and refresh this puny body of mine.&#x0201D;</note> my Friend, this great rough purple sea-flood that roars under my little garret-window here, this too comes from Nantasket and farther,&#x02014;swung hitherward by the Moon and the Sun.&#x02014; It cannot be said that I feel &#x0201C;happy&#x0201D; here, which means joyful;&#x02014;as far as possible from that. The Cave of Trophonius<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401203-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:343</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-12-03">3 Dec. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> could not be grimmer for one, than this old Land of Graves. But it is a sadness worth any hundred &#x0201C;happinesses.&#x0201D; <foreign><hi rend="italic">N&#x02019;en parlons plus</hi></foreign> [Let us not speak of it further]. By the way, have you ever clearly remarked withal what a despicable function &#x0201C;view-hunting&#x0201D; is.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 151&#x02013;52.</note> Analogous to &#x0201C;philanthropy,&#x0201D; &#x0201C;pleasures of virtue&#x0201D; &#x00026;c, &#x00026;c. I for my part, in these singular cricumstances, often find an honestly ugly country the preferable one. Black eternal peat-bog, or these waste-howling sands with mews and sea-gulls: you meet at least no Cockney to exclaim, &#x0201C;How charming it is!&#x0201D;&#x02014;</p>
<p>One of the last things I did in London was to pocket Bookseller Brown&#x02019;s &#xa3;38: a very honest-looking man, that Brown; whom I was sorry I could not manage to welcome better. You asked in that Letter about some other item of business,&#x02014;Munro&#x02019;s or Brown&#x02019;s Account to acknowledge?&#x02014;something or other that I was to <hi rend="italic">do:</hi> I only remember vaguely that it seemed to me I had as good as done it.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Brown (<date when="1800">1800</date>&#x02013;<date when="1855">1855</date>) of C. C. Little &#x00026; James Brown, TC&#x02019;s Boston publishers. Brown had brought TC a copy of Jones Very, <hi rend="italic">Essays and Poems</hi> (Boston, <date when="1839">1839</date>). Emerson had asked TC, <date when="1841-05-30">30 May</date>, to &#x0201C;look into your account with him, &#x00026; make it a little plainer than I have succeeded in doing,&#x0201D; and to acknowledge the account from Munroe &#x00026; Co.</note> Your Letter is not here now, but at Chelsea.</p>
<p>Three sheets of the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> lay waiting me at my Mother&#x02019;s, for correction; needing as good as none. The type and shape is the same a<supplied>[s that]</supplied> of late <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Heroes</hi>. Robson the Printer, who is a very punctual intelligent man, a scholar withal, undertook to be himself the Corrector of the other sheets: I hope you will find them &#x0201C;exactly conformable to the text, <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> mere typographical blunders and the <pb id="pg-13-219" n="13:219"/>more salient American spellings (labor for labour &#x00026;c).&#x0201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably quoting Robson.</note> The Book is perhaps just getting itself subscribed in these very days. It should have been out before now: but poor Fraser is in the country, dangerously ill, which perhaps retards it a little; and the season, at any rate, is at the very dullest. By the first conveyance I will send a certain Lady<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lydia Emerson.</note> two copies of it. Little danger but the Edition will sell; Fraser knows his own Trade well enough, and is as much a <foreign>&#x0201C;desperado&#x0201D;</foreign> as poor Attila Schmelzle was!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In J.

Harriet Martineau, whom I saw in passing hitherward, writes with her accustomed enthusiasm about it.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harriet Martineau wrote to Fanny Wedgwood, in <date when="1841-08">Aug.</date>: &#x0201C;I suppose it is the first immortal Amer<hi rend="italic">n</hi> book. It has come to me like a visitation of health.&#x0201D; And she said that she had told Emerson it would live &#x0201C;1,000 years&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Harriet Martineau&#x02019;s Letters</hi>, ed.

John Sterling scolds and kisses it (as the manner of the man is), and concludes by inquiring, whether there is any procurable likeness of Emerson? Emerson himself can <hi rend="italic">answer</hi>. There ought to be.</p>
<p>&#x02014;Good Heavens!

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The second of your unacknowledged parcels of cigars<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first parcel was sent with John Carlyle&#x02019;s letter from St. Leonard&#x02019;s-on-Sea, Sussex, <date when="1841-08-09">9 Aug.</date></note> has just arrived this morning. Thank you kindly for them all. The <hi rend="italic">matches</hi>, I feel with my fingers, are in this latter parcel: I am now completely equipt for smoking; my cigar-case full, these two Sussex packages unopened, and one cigar over,&#x02014;in all, some 37 cigars! I use very few here; but shall find them come in excellent stead if I go to Speddingdom, as seems likely.</p>
<p>Yesternight Jamie came down for Isabella and my Mother, and took them all away after dinner. I know not if I mentioned that on Tuesday last I was to go up again for my Mother, that she might have an additional bathe: I managed that enterprise; brought Jamie and Alick, who had both some business in this quarter, down too,&#x02014;Jamie riding in the gig with us as far as the <hi rend="italic">Howes;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Half mi. W of Annan where Alexander and his family had lived, <date when="1835">1835</date>&#x02013;<date when="1837">37</date>.</note> both assembling with the general company here at dinner; the whole day going off in <hi rend="italic">busy donothingism</hi>, pleasant enough for me. They are all gone now: Alick and his Wife are to come down on Sunday; that will be our last visit, for on the morrow<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1841-08-23">Mon., 23 Aug.</date></note> we ourselves go away. Mary&#x02019;s eldest <foreign>lassie</foreign> has come down again this morning, with milk &#x00026;c; we propose driving her up again in half an hour, and I write to you in the interim. Our time, which is about done here, has gone along as well as was needful,&#x02014;in a kind of vagabond style; the fruits of which I expect afterwards. I have lived as it were entirely alone; in company with the Titanic Elements, Spirits of the Water, Earth, Wind and Mud: by no means the worst company. Last night, after dusk, I walked along the River to Annan, then across the Bridge, Smiddie-Brae (once &#x0201C;Trimmie&#x0201D;!) and up the cow holm as far as Gallowbank Pool; in a grey wild wind, in perfect solitude, except for sleeping cows, except three fishers too whose rude Annan voices I heard, busy in their <hi rend="italic">trows</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fishing by dragging a baited line through the water. For a photograph of the pool, see J. M. Sloan, <hi rend="italic">The Carlyle Country</hi> (<date when="1904">1904</date>) 197.</note> in the Gallowbank Pool when I arrived. No walk in the world could be more impressive to me. I looked into the Lady Well in passing home again; Annan Street had groups of &#x02019;Prentice <foreign>Lads</foreign> &#x00026;c on it, and maid-servants in white aprons. Tom Willison&#x02019;s shop-light was shining far up the <pb id="pg-13-221" n="13:221"/>street (Beyond Scott&#x02019;s Bank, you remember);<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Scott, Commercial Bank; Willison not further identified.</note>&#x02014;but Tom himself I suppose is laid long since in the everlasting Night, or the everlasting Day. I said to myself, God <hi rend="italic">is</hi> great, and this World of His! Near ten o&#x02019;clock I was here again.</p>
<p>Our good Mother, still occasionally in great vexation, is pretty well in health, and undoubtedly getting more composed. Jenny, when I saw her on Tuesday morning, did not seem yet to have resolved on any thing: it is better that she take time.&#x02014; Grahame&#x02019;s sister of Burnswark, Mrs Howatson, is just on the verge of her end;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Howatson, d. <date when="1841-08-30">30 Aug.</date>, aged 71.</note> in great suffering, poor woman. Nelson I have seen nothing more of; of Stewart yet nothing.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably James Hope Stewart.</note> The other morning we had to witness a Shipwreck: right opposite our windows here, on the Cumberland coast, an American <hi rend="italic">Timbership</hi>, in very fine weather, with all sails set, had gone too shallow; and &#x0201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">coupit</hi></foreign> [capsized],&#x0201D; directly on striking &#x02018;the bank&#x02019; It was painfully interesting till the Belfast Steamer, making all way against the rush of the tide, got up and saved the crew, 11 men. The poor Steamer came swashing by in two hours after with a flag at every mast and yard, in token of her joy.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410818-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1841-08-18">18 Aug.</date></ref></note> The wreck lay like a great drowned Leviathan, with limbs broken, for two tides: she then vanished, to the Docks of Port Carlisle I fancy.</p>
<p>Templand is still pretty full of Liverpool people:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Welsh family.</note> it is very possible <hi rend="italic">I</hi> may leave it again on Tuesday, to <hi rend="italic">come up</hi> again for Jane.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Today I write to you by our Mother&#x02019;s request, as well as by motion of my own; she has had your Letter for some days, and is altogether restless at not being able to fill the cover you sent her. Literally it has not been well in her power. I was to make innumberable apologies. Our poor good Mother! She is lying in bed today, really very sick,&#x02014;a temporary fit of biliousness, I think, brought on by the many confusions she has been living in of late. The little dose of medicine that she has taken will soon bring her round again, we hope.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-222" n="13:222"/>On my arrival here last night I found that Jenny had <hi rend="italic">gone back to her Luckless of a Husband;</hi> such had been the conclusion she arrived at. The Blockhead has never yet rightly quitted his house at Kirtlebrig, where I suppose all manner of confusion and peril still reigns for him; no outlook but that of hard daily labour or starvation; which alternative is indeed the only wholesome one for the like of him. I got it made plain to Jenny that if she chose to stay with her children and take care of our Mother, you and I would consider that she was working for us, and allow her annually &#xa3;10 apiece, which, with my Mother&#x02019;s income, might in some quiet cottage with cow-park and <foreign>etceteras</foreign>, make up a sufficient income for them both, and an eligible kind of life for her. I had, before that, explained that so long as she continued with such a man as hers had proved to be, no aid or countenance could be afforded to him or her. She made her choice, as above, the day before yesterday: who shall say, poor thing, that she did wrong? Jamie tells me that my Mother and she were like to be quite miserable together; that he himself considered it to be the elegiblest course, the one Jenny took, in the mood she was in. We all lament the sharp suffering of my Mother, which nobody can save her from: but expect that a little time, aided by keeping her as much as possible out of all sound of that sorry business, will compose her again. Poor body, she was miserably sick, taken all of a sudden, this forenoon; she is very weak, even at the healthiest:&#x02014;already now however while I write (4 O&#x02019;clock) she has taken some vestige of dinner, and is greatly better again.</p>
<p>We left on Monday, as computed; got up to Templand, in pleasant weather, an exception out of deluges and tempests. Three Welshes, Walter, Alick, Margaret were there: I passed two days, well enough, in &#x0201C;total silence,&#x0201D; or the approach to such,&#x02014; poor Jane lying sick. On the latter of these days Archy Glen came; on his way to see W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> at Carstammon: Peter wants <hi rend="italic">more money</hi> for W.;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Archibald Glen of Glasgow (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390607-TC-AG-01"><sic>11:122&#x02013;23</sic><corr>TC to AG, <date when="1839-06-07">7 June 1839</date></corr></ref>); his insane brother William boarded with Peter Austin of Carstammon, nr. Craigenputtoch, from <date when="1834">1834</date> till his death; see earlier vols.</note> I advised Archy not to give it. A shrewd, active, rather humorous, clever kind of man, this Archy. Except David Hope,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Hope (d. <date when="1857">1857</date>), of Fleming &#x00026; Hope, commission merchants, 26 South Hanover St., Glasgow; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220323-TC-DH-01"><sic>2:71</sic><corr>TC to DH, <date when="1822-03-23">23 March 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note> who came down to us on the Sunday evening while Alick and Jenny were there, I have seen no other stranger at all, had no other adventure at all.</p>
<p>Jean at Dumfries was suffering much as I passed yesterday: what they call a <foreign><hi rend="italic">beelin&#x02019;</hi></foreign> [festering] <hi rend="italic">breast</hi> was her ailment; and she knew not what Surgeon to consult, with any chance of getting a rational advice about it. There seemed a chance too that the suppuration was <hi rend="italic">complete;</hi> <pb id="pg-13-223" n="13:223"/>that perhaps a prick of the lancet might now put an end to it. I urged her to go and consult somebody. She was looking wretchedly thin, poor Jean; otherwise her Goodman and she appear to be doing altogether well. Alick, last night, was with Jamie at Carlisle Fair, as I passed thro&#x02019;: they came home about 9 O&#x02019;clock, that is, Jamie arrived here then. Jamie Austin was here this morning about sheep. There is a bulletin from all sides of the Kindred!</p>
<p>As for me, I am off to Speddingdom on Monday morning, to continue in that quarter for a week. Jane will remain with her Mother till I come back. Jamie takes me down in the gig to Carlisle; at 2 o&#x02019;clock a Coach sets off thence for Keswick, arrives about 8&#xBD;. I will take all your cigars with me, for one item! Let me have a Letter from you thither; thereupon I will answer. The address is Greta Bank, Keswick (T. Spedding Esq). I have two other persons to see, and shall make out my week among them better or worse.</p>
<p>Poor James Fraser, we shall likely never see him more. I was truly sorry to read that Note from his Brother last night, in answer to a word of inquiry I had sent.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was to die, <date when="1841-10-02">2 Oct.</date> His brother was a solicitor, either Alexander Fraser, 1 Serle St. and 6 Lincoln&#x02019;s Inn Fields, or Michael Fraser, 2 Furnival&#x02019;s Inn.</note> Ah me!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> was lying for my Mother; I brought it over in my pocket. One came to myself the week before: a dull crabbed Paper, <hi rend="italic">wort</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">h</hi>]</supplied> reading now and then.</p>
<p>&#x02014;Along with David Hope that evening, Wull Carruthers came in, or indeed it was to <hi rend="italic">seek</hi> David that he came: one of the notablest Orsons!&#x02014;</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother. Write to Keswick and be well.</salute></closer></p>

<p>Certainly, Darling, I am not &#x0201C;virtuously disposed&#x0201D; today&#x02014;since I came into the world, I do not remember to have been ever more <hi rend="italic">vicious</hi> than for the last four weeks&#x02014;but virtuous-looking actions proceed often enough out of the purest egoism; and so I write to you today simply because my desire to know what you are all doing and where you all are begins to be &#x0201C;rather exquisite.&#x0201D; In my &#x0201C;cottage by the seaside&#x0201D; I lost all definite notions of time; and in the confusion of removal I put your letter, along with most other things which I needed to bring with me here, into the trunk that was left to be sent direct, to London. So that I have not your programme to refer to with such exposition from maps and dates as were now attainable&#x02014; I write then to beg that you will give me a new programme&#x02014;and shall address my letter to the care of the only one among us who preserves himself calm and clear in the midst of all terrestrial confusions and commotions,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erasmus Darwin.</note> and has always some practical sense in him for the service of his infatuated friends, beyond what is needed for the preservation of his own life and fortunes.</p>
<p>I need not tell you of <hi rend="italic">Newby;</hi> you seem already to have been sufficiently well instructed in the particulars of that grotesque location&#x02014;enough that we have quitted it, and hope never to look upon its like again! never! Even Carlyle who viewed it thro&#x02019;out thro&#x02019; that extenuating medium, thro&#x02019; which a man naturally views his own &#x0201C;realized ideal&#x0201D; joins I believe most cordially in my thanksgiving at having quitted it, and my hope never to set foot there anymore&#x02014;and Helen has gone back to Cheyne Row declaring it to have been &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">poor pleasure</hi> as ever she tried&#x02014;a really miserable job&#x0201D;&#x02014; On my arrival at my Mothers, the first thing I did was to go to bed and be very ill for two days&#x02014;and the comfort of these two days was indescribable! To feel myself so <pb id="pg-13-225" n="13:225"/>intensely once more in the region of white sheets, and pretty chintzy curtains and soft carpets and green waving trees!&#x02014;and to have one&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> nice-looking mother bringing one little seductive-looking <hi rend="italic">white</hi>-napkined trays, which one had the firmest, most consolatory assurance would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> contain&#x02014;a <hi rend="italic">flounder!</hi> And to have no Sea moan-moaning under ones window&#x02014;no cat followed by a stream of kittens invading ones privacy&#x02014;no &#x0201C;industrious fleas&#x0201D; constraining one to light Lucifers in the dead watches of the night&#x02014;no anything to disturb one&#x02019;s exquisite sense of quietude and cleanness and maternal blessing&#x02014;oh you cannot figure what a &#x0201C;rehabilitation of the flesh&#x0201D; all this was for me! Now I am up again&#x02014;running about looking at every thing, and extacizing over every thing as if I had been just imported from the backwoods&#x02014;actually I have looked at myself in every mirror in the house with a sort of childish exultation in beholding the face of me once more all of a piece!&#x02014;at Newby I never saw myself but &#x0201C;with the eyes all about&#x0201D; and divided into sections&#x02014; Carlyle too I observed looking into all the mirrors with a singular, tho silent complacency,&#x02014;. But he is off again!&#x02014;alas is he not &#x0201C;made like unto a wheel&#x0201D;?&#x02014; He might have done so well here for a little while&#x02014;if like Macready<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W.

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Good Young Friends</hi>,&#x02014;</salute>It is many years since I ceased reading German or any other metaphysics, and gradually came to discern that I had happily got done with that matter altogether. By what steps, series of books, and other influences, such result was brought about, it would now be extremely difficult to say.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On pp. 56&#x02013;58 Espinasse tells of TC&#x02019;s influence on himself and Dunipace: &#x0201C;Carlyle had in his own case reconciled reason with faith; this &#x02026; it was that attracted to him those two striplings. And he had indicated that for others this consummation so devoutly to be wished was attainable through a right study of German literature. &#x02026; With limited resources we had essayed to decipher this new revelation. But though the effort brought us much knowledge, its object still eluded us. Then, in an impatient mood, we indited a brief letter to Carlyle, in which something was said of what seemed to us his supreme position in contemporary English literature. We mentioned our slender studies in German philosophy, and, with the audacity of youth &#x02026; , we asked him for a solution of the mystery of existence. To our surprise &#x02026; there arrived before long an answer. &#x02026; Our foolish epistle had found him in a genial mood.&#x0201D;</note> Few books stand prominently with me above the general dimness. My power to serve you in this matter is accordingly very small. I can only say that my curiosity was once as intense as yours; my obstructions and obscurations perhaps greater than yours; that by studying of great thinkers (wheresoever met with, howsoever named or rubricked), above all, by thinking and struggling earnestly myself, help and victory were certain for me, as they will be for you and for all that do the like.</p>
<p>Those two little books of Fichte&#x02019;s and Schelling&#x02019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Fichte, <hi rend="italic">&#xdc;ber das Wesen des Gelehrten</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1806">1806</date>) and F. W. J. von Schelling, <hi rend="italic">Vorlesungen &#xfc;ber die Methode des Academischen Studium</hi> (T&#xfc;bingen, <date when="1803">1803</date>); see Espinasse 59.</note> are bright in my <pb id="pg-13-228" n="13:228"/>memory beyond all others that I read on that subject. Perhaps there is not elsewhere, for a British student, as much of interest and novelty extant, in equal compression, in the whole literature of German philosophy. One other book I also favourably remember: <hi rend="italic">The Life of Fichte</hi>, by his Son, two moderate German volumes, of recent date comparatively,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Immanuel Hermann von Fichte, <hi rend="italic">J. G. Fichte&#x02019;s Leben und litterarischer Briefwechsel</hi>, 2 vols. (Sulzbach, <date when="1830">1830</date>&#x02013;<date when="1831">31</date>).</note> in which, I think, you will find some glimpses of the general field of German metaphysics, and indications for you of roads, towards whatever quarter you may be bound. It is easily read, too, which is an advantage. I may say further that after all the Fichteisms, Schellingisms, Hegelisms, I still understand <hi rend="italic">Kant</hi> to be the grand novelty, the prime author of the new spiritual world, of whom all the others are but superficial, transient modifications. If you do decide to penetrate into this matter, what better can you do than vigorously set to the <hi rend="italic">Kritik der reinen Vernunft</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Immanuel Kant (Riga, <date when="1781">1781</date>).</note> a very attainable book, and resolutely study it and re-study it till you understand it? You will find it actually capable of being understood, rigorously sequent, like a book of mathematics; labour that pays itself; really one of the best metaphysical studies that I know of. Once master of Kant, you have attained what I reckon most precious, perhaps alone precious in that multifarious business of German philosophy: namely, deliverance from the fatal <foreign>incubus</foreign> of Scotch or French philosophy, with its mechanisms and its Atheisms, and be able perhaps to wend on your way leaving both of them behind you. In fine, if you prosecute the study, it will be well to consult Sir William Hamilton, your neighbour, probably your former teacher;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hamilton was prof. of logic and metaphysics, <date when="1836">1836</date>&#x02013;<date when="1856">56</date>. Neither of them was a philosophy student.</note> he of all men, British or foreign, is the best acquainted with the bibliography of German and other metaphysics, the ablest, therefore, to direct you towards books in any specific case. A Mr. Ferrier<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Frederick Ferrier (<date when="1808">1808</date>&#x02013;<date when="1864">64</date>;<ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9369"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), advocate and metaphysician; nephew of Susan Ferrier (<ref target="volume-10/lt-18380906-TC-JWC-01"><sic>10:163</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1838-09-06">6 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>); first educ. by the Rev. Henry Duncan of Ruthwell; studied philosophy in Heidelberg, <date when="1834">1834</date>; contrib. to <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x02019;s Magazine;</hi> a close friend of Sir William Hamilton, he became prof. of civil history, <date when="1842">1842</date>, the chair the students wished TC to fill.</note> of your city I believe to be likewise worth inquiring of. On this business of metaphysics, I know not that I can safely counsel further. Go on, and prosper.</p>
<p>For the rest, let it be no disappointment, if, after all study, you do not learn &#x02018;what we are;&#x02019; nay, if you discover that metaphysics cannot by possibility teach us <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a result, or even that metaphysics is but a <pb id="pg-13-229" n="13:229"/>kind of disease, and the inquiry itself a kind of disease.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x0201C;Characteristics,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 28:40.</note> We shall never know &#x0201C;what we are;&#x0201D; on the other hand, we can always partly know, what beautiful or noble things we are fit to do, and that is the grand inquiry for us. The Hebrew Psalmist said, &#x0201C;I am fearfully and wonderfully made;&#x0201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 139:14.</note> <hi rend="italic">God</hi> so made me. No Kant or Hegel,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. W. F. Hegel (<date when="1770">1770</date>&#x02013;<date when="1831">1831</date>), German philosopher.</note> as I take it, can do much more than say the like, in the wider, complicated dialect we now have.</p>
<p>On the whole, we learn better what man is by seeing extensively what good or great things have come out of man; I mean practically here: that the literature of Germany is perhaps likely to be a far greater possession for you than its metaphysics. The anatomical skeleton,&#x02014;nay, we will call it the impalpable, unembodied soul; contrast that with the living man, visible and audible there! Your rule in reading for self-culture is to get acquainted with great men, and great thinkers, on what subject soever they may write; it will be a <hi rend="italic">humane</hi> subject, or they will not deserve the name of great. Goethe, Schiller, Jean Paul! I will name these three to you. It seems to me there lies more in these men, and in men like them, than in all bodies of philosophy. He who has discerned the world as these men discerned it,&#x02014;is not he educated to the highest point of vision human kind has yet attained to, an authentic man of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> generation, with all past generations lying obedient under his feet, not <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>obedient round his legs, round his very throat?</p>
<p>Good young friends! I have no time to write more. I bid you persist in the same noble temper. Through many difficulties and confusions, you need not doubt a good issue, if you have strength to endure honestly, manfully. Your help lies within yourself; your hindrance too lies there.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 196&#x02013;97.</note> Courage. Forward, forward!</p>

Presumably Weir had now moved to London and asked TC to vouch for his suitability to Craik, who worked with Knight on the pubs. of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge; he was to contribute to Knight&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pictorial History of England</hi>.</note> My Mother too fell very unwell yesterday (happily better again, tho&#x02019; still weak), and there is on all hands confusion enough. I hope my poor Jane has slept, and is well, and will be well till I return.</p>
<p>Spedding&#x02019;s Letter, which is here, awaited me at Ecclefechan: I have written that I am to go by Carlisle on Monday. Do you address to me there.&#x02014; The trunks are all here; safe apparently; Mary also reported that your two rings were safe in the hands of Ellen.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Mitchell on her way back to Chelsea.</note> The old Solway steamer, which saved those wrecked men, is herself a wreck this week: my Mother was in great anxiety about Ellen; but that is not Ellen&#x02019;s ship at all. The people were all saved, but many Irish cattle had to be thrown overboard and perish.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Solway</hi> from Belfast ran aground and was hopelessly damaged 3 mi. SW of Southerness, Galloway, <date when="1841-08-24">24 Aug.</date>; most of the cattle were saved; the people were Irish reapers coming for work in Scotland.</note></p>
<p>A Letter from Fraser&#x02019;s Brother explains that there is no hope for poor James; who has returned three weeks ago to his Mother&#x02019;s house in Argyle street, and is composedly dying there! Alas poor James!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Jenny and her children had left this the day before my arrival, and returned to her blockhead man. Her conclusion had been that she could not yet quit him: who shall say that the poor creature was wrong? I am heartily sorry for her, but can do nothing except altogether hold my tongue.</p>
<p>In looking in my trunk yesterday, I found the fatallest deficiency of collars; only <hi rend="italic">five</hi> washed or unwashed, and three of them very ragged and unserviceable! Isabella, called to counsel, got her sister<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Martha Calvert.</note> set on, and there are six new ones to be ready and dressed this night. My Mother had failed in certain flannel shirts; happily only one was made at all: I keep it, and the other two uncut, for you and Ellen. I wish I were off and back!&#x02014; If there be a Letter at Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, I will add a <hi rend="italic">stroke</hi> below the address. Remember Greta Bank,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spedding&#x02019;s home.</note>&#x02014;<closer><salute>and so <foreign>adieu</foreign> now!</salute></closer></p>

<p>I have your letter only now (Monday at one oclock) and it could have come from London in twenty four hours! &#x0201C;Was there ever any thing in the least like it&#x0201D;?&#x02014; In fact as Helen says of the weather sometimes <pb id="pg-13-233" n="13:233"/>&#x0201C;it is <hi rend="italic">most</hi> dilatory&#x0201D;! I went myself to the postoffice thro&#x02019; the rain, old Mary not having turned up<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Mills; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390727-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:154</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-07-27">27 July 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x02014;and sent off two newspapers on the spot&#x02014;addressed to Greta Bank&#x02014;Penrith&#x02014;and now I begin to think I should not have put Penrith but Keswick<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Keswick is correct; Penrith further E in Cumberland.</note>&#x02014; What a wretched day you are getting for your journey&#x02014;what a wretched day everybody is getting for everything&#x02014; In fact the whole world is going to perdition it strikes me! My Mother has a bad headach&#x02014;myself am <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> and there is now no bread that [&#x0201C;]<hi rend="italic">can</hi> be eaten&#x0201D;&#x02014;the scones and cakes have been discontinued, as it was observed that I eat only these&#x02014;and my Mother declared them to be &#x0201C;exceedingly indigestible for me&#x0201D;&#x02014;so that I live upon coffee and butchersmeat&#x02014;and am terribly in need of having some flour thrown into the system! For two or three nights I slept very well nevertheless&#x02014;almost alarmingly well for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x02014;but I felt no better for it during the day&#x02014;so that I have returned without regret to my old course of lying awake till three! And <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are still jumping up at untimely hours and swallowing castor! What a beautiful pair we are!</p>
<p>Helen is <hi rend="italic">safe</hi> at Chelsea&#x02014;at least so I gather from the strange little document I received from her today&#x02014; &#x0201C;very much detached&#x0201D; and destitute of particulars &#x0201C;to a degree&#x0201D;! indeed it seems as if she had been struck by lightening in the middle of it&#x02014;only that the thing was addressed and wafered afterwards! I have finished <hi rend="italic">Le dernier jour d&#x02019;un condamn&#xE9;</hi> [<hi rend="italic">The Last Day of a Condemned Man</hi>]&#x02014;and declare Victor Hugo to be &#x0201C;a sort of man that one would like to see&#x0201D;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(Paris, <date when="1829">1829</date>).

<salute>Dear Jeannie,</salute>
<p>You must be content with one brief word today; it is much, in the mood I am in,&#x02014;on the morrow after my arrival.</p>
<p>Monday, which proved wet as Noah, over all this quarter of the Island, happily declared itself in a manner reckoned decisive some few minutes <hi rend="italic">before</hi> Jamie had yoked and taken me away. &#x0201C;It is going to be nothing but wet,&#x0201D; said he: whereupon I decided to wait; having prepared my Keswick hosts for such a result in such a case. My baggage stood packed; the little portmanteau, hatcase, and my Mother&#x02019;s old carpetbag (for I have taken dressing-gown and all); Isabella washed my remaining shirts;&#x02014;the shirt-collars of Ecclefechan manufacture, passable not excellent, were all ready the day before. And so yesterday morning we did get off. Jamie had me at Carlisle, thro&#x02019; a damp gradually brightening morning, about one o&#x02019;clock; at two I was rolling off in a melancholy vehicle drawn by two bad horses named the &#x0201C;royal victoria Keswick Coach&#x0201D;; faring in which over hilly laborious roads in the brightest afternoon with the beautifullest occasional views (up beyond <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in Nithsdale and elsewhere!) I got sluggishly along to Cockermouth about sunset, and then hither 13 miles farther by beautiful moonlight, along the edge of Bassenthwaite Lake, some time between 9 and 10. I had got no dinner, had no appetite for any! The good <pb id="pg-13-235" n="13:235"/>Thomas Spedding was waiting for me with a gig. The lady was all smiles;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Spedding.</note> had tea standing,&#x02014;I preferred mutton chops and a glass of punch. I had to talk, talk,&#x02014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott!</hi></foreign> At one o&#x02019;clock I got to sleep, in a sumptuous commodious bed (except that there was no fire); and awoke, in a most <hi rend="italic">lively</hi> humour a little before five. A footman enters about 7; half past 9 does at last arrive, and we have breakfast. I have smoked 3 cigars since I awoke, and am here in my own upper-room about 11 o&#x02019;clock, writing to poor Goody. The day again, as if by miracle, is bright; a talk exists about horses and riding if my Letters were done. My head is none of the wholest;&#x02014;I shall be better tomorrow. James Spedding is not here, but with his Father some miles off; I rather conjecture he and Pollock who is with him are coming to dine here today.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Frederick Pollock (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x02013;<date when="1888">88</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22480"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), barrister; B.A., Trinity College, Cambridge, <date when="1836">1836</date>; admitted to bar, <date when="1838">1838</date>; master of the court of exchequer, <date when="1846">1846</date>; succeeded to baronetcy, <date when="1870">1870</date>; known for his <hi rend="italic">Personal Remembrances</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1887">1887</date>). He and James Spedding stayed with John (<date when="1770">1770</date>&#x02013;<date when="1851">1851</date>) and Sarah (d. <date when="1842">1842</date>) Spedding, at Mirehouse on Bassenthwaite Lake, nr. Keswick, and later with James and Mary Marshall at Monk Coniston.</note> I find all hospitable, elegant, honest and good here; I shall do well enough for a day or two. It is a new large many-winged House, on smooth elevated lawns, with woods, with walks, the everlasting moan of the Greta water (rather louder than Newby) heard far down under these windows. On looking out at 6 o&#x02019;clock this morning, my view was up Borrowdale; gnarled mountains, umbrageous, verdant craggy, spotted and fretted with shadow sunshine rock and tree; about the beautifulest view I ever in my life looked on. &#x0201C;What&#x02019;s ta use on&#x02019;t?&#x0201D; I wish my poor Goody had been here to see with me! But she has not strength for it more than I. Great regret is expressed for her,&#x02014;expressed <hi rend="italic">and</hi> understood!</p>
<p>I have my Mother to write to, then Jack (for cigars), then Miss Fenwick. Sister Jean is very poorly at Dumfries with a gathering in the breast; poor Jean. Jenny I believe is coming back, for good, to my Mother.&#x02014; Jamie says if you want to get carried away Tynewards, or anywhither, <hi rend="italic">before</hi> my return,&#x02014;you have only to let <hi rend="italic">him</hi> know, and he will meet you &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">ai</hi>ny day.&#x0201D; I got your two Letters, as perhaps the <hi rend="italic">strokes</hi> would testify: thanks to you. I answered the two philosophical chickens; poor fellows.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Espinasse and Henry Dunipace.</note>&#x02014; Are you well, dear <foreign>Bairn</foreign>? Write, write; perhaps you have already written. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu, Basta</foreign> [Enough]!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I think your affectionate anxieties could hardly contrive to give you much misery about me yesterday, especially after Jamie&#x02019;s safe arrival; the day was so fine! I hope he did arrive safe, about 7 o&#x02019;clock, and poor Jenny with him.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle had driven TC to Carlisle and, on return, had picked up his sister Janet Hanning at Kirtlebridge.</note></p>
<p>It was one of the beautifulest days; our voyage was slow, but pleasant and prosperous: I often saw Burnswark and all Dumfriesshire as on a map, when we got to the tops of hills. I smoked plenty of cigars; I could have had another luncheon of food about 5 o&#x02019;clock, but had no appetite for any: at Cockermouth, where the Sun was just setting and the great round Moon rising over the Mountains, I put on my shawl and mackintosh; we had still 13 miles; it was about 9 o&#x02019;clock when we arrived: I had suffered nothing from cold or the like; and the good Spedding was waiting when I arrived, to whirl me off in his gig. I dined <hi rend="italic">then;</hi> I had a capital bed, and four hours of deep sleep: the whirl of my head will have settled, I hope, before tomorrow;&#x02014;I am to have some riding today were these Letters of mine done. Our day is again bright: it is by far the beautifullest country this to look upon I ever saw; the prospect from my bedroom windows, where I now am, is up that hollow space which you observe immediately to the right of Skiddaw, a mass of wild ragged hills and mountains, fringed with woods, with grassy sides, with the strangest <hi rend="italic">gnarls</hi> of tops and edges. If the day keep fair, we may perhaps ride to look at some of them close at hand.</p>
<p>But I have still a Letter to write to Jack; I have already written a Note to Jane and another short one to a Lady in this quarter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Isabella Fenwick.</note> whom I had to apprise of my arrival here. I should be better riding than writing!</p>
<p>All things lay right in my trunks and bags; thanks to Isabella and the rest of you. I must endeavour to get a pipe or set of pipes today; I am getting quite tired of cigars, independently of the <hi rend="italic">price</hi> of them. I hope you have news from Jean, and favourable news. Jamie undertook that it was to be conveyed hither to me. I rather fear we are almost as far off (by post) as at London here! It is another reason for our losing no time to write.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-237" n="13:237"/>Dear Mother, I will write to you again in a few days, whether I hear from you or not. I pray you, if it were possible give up those never-resting anxieties which do you great mischief: Jenny&#x02019;s misfortunes, and all our misfortunes, are we not taught that they can all become the material of <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, of profit and joy? Is not that a truth?</p>
<p><closer><salute>God be with you, dear Mother; with you and them all! I am greatly privileged to have you still here on Earth. Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter found me at Scotsbrig; mine<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1841-08-26">26 Aug.</date></note> I hope has reached you on the Sussex coast, and apprised you that I was bent hither.</p>
<p>Monday proved so dreadfully wet, there was no stirring out; but yesterday we had one of the finest days of the year, and so I managed the adventure. Jamie drove me along to Carlisle, then at 2 O&#x02019;clock a lumbering monster of a waggon-coach brought me along hither, by Wigton and round by Cockermouth: some 40 miles by that road (perhaps some 30 direct) in 7 hours. To any other man the adventure would have been of unmixed pleasure; to me it was pleasant but not unmixed. Alas, I have such a set of nerves: there is such a head on me today!</p>
<p>Your cigars were and still continue to be assaulted with terrible effect! I have nothing else since yesterday: but today I will find myself a pipe; I long for one even as a matter of taste (not <hi rend="italic">aesthetic</hi> taste!)</p>
<p>We had the beautefullest widest views yesterday: from Cairnsmoor (all the three Cairnsmoors<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC presumably means Cairnsmore, a mountain (2,612 ft.), 3&#xBD; mi. N of Carsphairn, N Kirkcudbrightshire, and Cairnsmore of Fleet (with two peaks, 2,331 and 2,152 ft.), 6&#xBD; mi. E of Newton Stewart, SW Kirkcudbrightshire.</note>) Dunscore Black Crag, Queensberry, Hartfell, Ettrick Pen, all Dumf<hi rend="italic">shire</hi> spread out as on a map;&#x02014;this Earth is God&#x02019;s; and one&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">natal</hi> land; one&#x02019;s cradle, one&#x02019;s table, one&#x02019;s everlasting bed of rest. O my brother, my brother!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 188&#x02013;89.</note></p>
<p>Spedding&#x02019;s place here is a very nice thing, a good roomy ashlar house, white-painted well-furnished, among trim lawns, close by the roar of the Greta (<hi rend="italic">Great-Aa,</hi> Big water) which rushes swiftly far below; half a mile from Keswick towards the south: in one of the noblest <pb id="pg-13-238" n="13:238"/>amphitheatres of crag and shaggy verdure,&#x02014;married together sweetly, like Eternity to Time in a healthy Life (as Jean Paul would say). Positively I care little about scenery. Yet this surely is worth looking at. Today we are to go and ride: that, I hope, will still this head of mine a little.</p>
<p>Having arrived so very lately I know not my whereabout altogether; that is, tho&#x02019; I must try to see Miss Fenwick at Ambleside and the Marshalls at Hallsteads,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John and Jane Marshall.</note> I yet know not when or how I shall or can go, or whether at all. <hi rend="italic">This</hi> is to be my head-quarters. I engaged to be back in Annandale again, probably about Monday. I will write to you again before I go.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I will beg you to send me again a little <hi rend="italic">tinder</hi> (matches, I mean): one of your matches is worth two of mine in this damp atmosphere, and at any rate I know not where to get more here and and<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> am fast ebbing. James S. the younger Brother, who is coming today, will probably have some. Never mind the cigars: them I can buy here,&#x02014;and indeed I will and must have <hi rend="italic">pipes</hi> till I begin travelling again.&#x02014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother: I have written nothing; I am not at all in good case for writing; but I could not but say a word to you of announcement that I was here.&#x02014; Jean had not got better (on Saturday last); Jenny was coming <hi rend="italic">back</hi> to my Mother, last night. A puddle of a business!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Wifie,</salute>
<p>Your Letter, with the great crowd of Newspapers (and one other Newspaper from Craik direct), lay waiting for me yesterday when I got down to dinner. Mine for you had gone off; I write another word this morning, having nothing so good to do for a few minutes as talk with you.</p>
<p>No sleep, no bread: I am heartily sorry for my poor Goody. We shall, it may be hoped, relish our own little brick dwelling, even tho&#x02019; at Chelsea among fogs, all the better when we get back. Ellen it does seem is there,&#x02014;or at least somewhere where &#x0201C;all is right&#x0201D;: her epistolary powers are certainly extraordinary.</p>
<p>Mrs Spedding is an extremely hospitable, mannerly woman; but <pb id="pg-13-239" n="13:239"/>silent to a degree; you, as her chosen companion, would have had no sinecure of it! Perhaps you are better away, listening to the howl of the winds, yourself in silence,&#x02014; Yesterday our Landlord and I, after my Letters were done, and the bright day had unexpectedly blackened itself into wind and rain, went out riding, in broadbrims and mackintoshes, on slow galloways, slow but sure, all round the Lake of Keswick or Derwentwater; a pleasant ride, in spite of the rain; for the rocks did not bore me, the rocks were beautiful with their wood plumages all rustling and moaning; and every step took away a bit of my headache, sunk out of sight a bit of my heartache. We did very well, considering. Arrived at home again, <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Spedding and Pollock had come over, with tobacco, with copious utterance: a dinner rather before six with one Meyers,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederic<sic>k</sic> Myers (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x02013;<date when="1851">51</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19688"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), educ. Cambridge, B.A., <date when="1833">1833</date>; perpetual curate, St. John&#x02019;s, Keswick (a new church built by the Marshalls), <date when="1838">1838</date>&#x02013;<date when="1851">51</date>. His second wife, m. <date when="1842">1842</date>, was Susan Harriet Marshall. He founded an infants&#x02019; and girls&#x02019; school and a public library, funded by the Marshalls, and began the lectures for the mechanics institute. Thomas Spedding wrote of him to James, <date when="1840-05-17">17 May 1840</date>: &#x0201C;I have seen something of Myers lately, who bears closer examination well. Tis only a Pity he should have been a Parson. He understands Carlyle well, &#x00026; is much smitten with &#x02018;Chartism.&#x02019;&#x0201D;</note> a fat little young parson of this place dependent on the Marshalls, went off with tolerable effect; and late in the evening the silent Lady <hi rend="italic">sang</hi> rather well: Jacobite songs and the like. I was not in bed till 1, awake again at 6: an hour or two of <hi rend="italic">George Sand</hi>, with the aid of a pipe and patience, brought me on to 9 o&#x02019;clock again, and plenty of tolerable coffee. The day is cloudy, and our new guests seem undecided what to do: I care not; I, with Literature of Desperation, and four new pipes, am prepared for all. The headache still continues; will continue, likely, but in a milder manner. We shall get along tolerably well. What a nuisance are lackeys! The plush-coat of this place bursts in every morning at 7, deranges all ones cigar-cases, tinder-boxes, apparatus, for the sake of a few strokes of brushing on one&#x02019;s clothes. Last night he or the housemaid had altogether hidden, lost or burnt my poor nightcap: had I not prudently been provided with a second in my drawer, I must have slept bare! Diogenes perhaps took the shortest cut to comfort, after all: that of <hi rend="italic">having</hi> the minimum of wants; the minimum therefore of disappointments.</p>
<p>Our Parson yesterday was a fat little oily character; gladder of me than I was of him. A celebrated &#x0201C;Russian Count&#x0201D; on the other side of the valley is to be dreaded today.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified, though Henry Crabb Robinson, <date when="1843-08-08">8 Aug. 1843</date>, refers to a request from John Wordsworth of Keswick, to get a trans. of a Russian letter &#x0201C;to an imposter calling himself Count Osolinski&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Henry Crabb Robinson on Books and their Writers</hi>, ed. E. J. Morley [<date when="1938">1938</date>] 2:633).</note> Miss Fenwick, I learn, is not in this <pb id="pg-13-240" n="13:240"/>country but at Bath in these weeks: my Note went off not the less, nay the more. The Marshalls all and sundry, it appears, are to be in this quarter precisely <hi rend="italic">about Monday</hi>,&#x02014;the James Marshalls here in this house on Saturday. I see not well how to manage; but think I will make James Spedding take me over to Hallsteads today or tomorrow (no, not today&#x02014;for the Russian Count!)&#x02014;and so get done with it. It is a thing to <hi rend="italic">do;</hi> as in fact all this matter is;&#x02014;as so many matters are! Yesterday we saw gig-fuls of people; ladies with enormous waxcloth hoods &#x00026;c, whirling up and down in spite of the rain, <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> Lodore Falls,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the head of Derwentwater.</note> and the other objects: hapless bodies!&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; I flatter myself I have declined Wordsworth, Dr Arnold (Rugby) and Hartley Coleridge:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Wordsworth (<date when="1770">1770</date>&#x02013;<date when="1850">1850</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29973"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); Thomas Arnold (<date when="1795">1795</date>&#x02013;<date when="1842">1842</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/686"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); Hartley Coleridge (<date when="1796">1796</date>&#x02013;<date when="1849">1849</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5880"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), eldest son of S.

To continue in the same: the harmonious blacksmith<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Whewell.</note> is to lecture at Keswick to some Mechanics<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Members of the mechanics institute.</note> or School-people, &#x0201C;on astronomy,&#x0201D; for Meyers the fat Parson: one individual will find it interesting not to hear.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, meaning himself.</note> Cordelia<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marshall.</note> too, however, is coming.&#x02014; Did you you<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> at all know John Marshall, the one that died lately? His Widow, since Spring last when I saw her at Headingley, has produced a kind of shock on all hands, by suddenly marrying the assistant Surgeon (I think, not the chief surgeon) of an Irish marching regiment; a man called O&#x02019;Callaghan.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Marshall (<date when="1797">1797</date>&#x02013;<date when="1836">1836</date>), M.P. for Leeds, second son of John Marshall.

<p>That night I came hither the old coachman pointed me out the clump of trees amid which stands Southey&#x02019;s house; where the light of his candle was there visibly shining, the light of his own soul gone out into darkness forever! They say he is not in much likelihood of dying soon. His poor Wife: she has had, in addition to all, a flagrant quarrel with two young Southeys a Son and Daughter, which grew to such height that the neighbours had to be called in (Thomas Spedding, among others), and the households had to part, the Son and Daughter taking up one of their own in the village hard by.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Southey (<date when="1774">1774</date>&#x02013;<date when="1843">1843</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26056"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), poet, who lived at Greta Hall, Keswick, had m., <date when="1839">1839</date>, his second wife, Caroline Anne Bowles (<date when="1786">1786</date>&#x02013;<date when="1854">1854</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26054"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391208-TC-RWE-01"><sic>11:229</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1839-12-08">8 Dec. 1839</date></corr></ref>, mistakenly noted as Catherine.

<salute>Dear Jeannie,</salute>
<p>I have just got the Marshall visit<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Patterdale Hall, Hallsteads, nr. Penrith.</note> accomplished; a business of four and twenty hours, in which James Spedding and my kind Landlord have most hospitably forwarded me. Our Landlord lent his Britschka, horse and groom over the mountain roads; James left his Pollock here, <pb id="pg-13-242" n="13:242"/>and volunteered to go with me and bear me safe thro&#x02019;,&#x02014;as he has honourably done. We had a dim threatening sky yesterday, which however did not actually rain much; we had tobacco, greatcoats, freedom, and a road by the base of Saddleback and pleasant valley of Threlkeld, over to Ulleswater, the beautifullest of all the Lake districts. We arrived some time after four; found the old pair and three of the daughters (Cordelia, the sick one, and the youngest<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Marshalls had six surviving das.; Cordelia was the second; &#x0201C;the sick one,&#x0201D; Ellen, remained a spinster; the youngest, Susan Harriet (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x02013;<date when="1878">78</date>), m., <date when="1842-03">March 1842</date>, Frederick Myers.</note>) at home, and very glad to see us. Some Sisters<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellen Pollard and another or other sisters.</note> of Mrs M. who live close by were engaged to dine,&#x02014;the hour 5. We were well lodged, well treated every way; I might have been very happy, had it not been for the old story, headache, sleeplessness &#x00026;c &#x00026;c, which make me a man like no other man. As it was, I have had few more insupportably obfuscated evenings;&#x02014;like to sink with weariness, weakness, stupidity and somnolence; then when <hi rend="italic">in</hi> bed, awaking at 3 &#x00026;c! A melancholy business;&#x02014;which however is now <hi rend="italic">done</hi>.&#x02014; Great regret was expressed for you; schemes were started of having you still brought on to Penrith, and so forth: in fact, I believe we could both of us do very well there, if we were once habituated: they are among the kindest truest people, and their house is among the completest and most perfectly elegant and convenient I have ever been in. Wealth and good sense can do no more. In beauty of situation, looking up from smooth shady lawns (the very cows on them seem all <hi rend="italic">curried</hi>) over the lake waters at their broadest to an amphitheatre of mountains crowned by Helvellyn; I never saw any view comparable to that out of their windows; I, who care next to nothing about views, found it really grand. Cordelia looked still more abashed and a little paler than of old. The sick one pleased me much. The Mother too I liked; and the good old Father better than ever. Why did you not come, and let us fairly get habituated! Our <supplied>[Or?]</supplied> would you not still? The Marshalls are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> to be convened again here on Monday, and the Speddings press me greatly to stay over that day, when doubtless &#x0201C;regrets&#x0201D; and perhaps reinvitations will once more come to light.</p>
<p>Alas, the James Marshalls to lodge, with the Monteagles to dine,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Garth and Mary Marshall and Thomas and Mary (Spring Rice), Lord and Lady Monteagle.</note> and that Russian Count (no escape <hi rend="italic">this</hi> time!) are looked for in an hour or two; and my head is still bad enough (tho&#x02019; I slept again, long treacle-sleeps after 3), and I have begged lip-salve for my lips, and <pb id="pg-13-243" n="13:243"/>my heart is entirely stupid and weary; and I could wish greatly to be let alone!</p>
<p>From you nothing came yesterday or the day before; I hope, but with no entire confidence there may be something today. I did get the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, by the bye; I also wrote to the Newsvender, about the change of address.</p>
<p>Here enters James<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spedding.</note> inviting me to Keswick with his Brother for a walk. It will heat my feet at any rate.</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Goody. Send me a favourable word, if thou canst, of thyself. <closer><salute>God help thee, poor thing, and me</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear&#x02014;</salute> Your letter written on Thursday morning<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1841-09-02">2 Sept.</date></note> was read yesterday afternoon&#x02014;from all parts of the kingdom letters take precisely the same time to arrive at Templand <foreign>viz</foreign>: two nights and two days! &#x0201C;After all, a <hi rend="italic">postman</hi> for all the <hi rend="italic">tatooing</hi> he makes is a comfortable phenomenon&#x0201D;!

<salute>Dear Jeannie,</salute>
<p>These four days I have been waiting, with more and more eagerness, for a Letter; but begin now to see that I shall hardly get one. <pb id="pg-13-246" n="13:246"/>Heaven grant you be not ill! Yesterday there did come a Newspaper, but without any strokes. Perhaps you have only &#x0201C;nothing to say,&#x0201D; and that is all. I have not heard from John either, tho&#x02019; I asked to write and <hi rend="italic">send tinder!</hi> I must be content. I write today for the last time from Keswick; it is still possible a Letter may come, but this will have gone first.</p>
<p>The kind Landlord here has, as it were, constrained me to stay yesterday and today, for which too there were other inducements; but tomorrow morning I do go: and as the Coach is one of the worst, this hospitable Spedding forwards me in his gig, by a near cut, about half way towards Carlisle; by which means we do not need to start till half past seven in place of six, and escape some nine miles of extremely ugly driving. The Coach finally will set me down in Carlisle about 12 or 1 o&#x02019;clock; and then, after 5 hours of painful donothingism, I get on to Ecclefechan, and may hope to arrive before eight. Write you <hi rend="italic">thither</hi>, at any rate, and let me know what you wish your motions to be.&#x02014; Perhaps, on the whole, it will be better that I <hi rend="italic">meet you at Dumfries</hi> with the gig; my travels have been so manifold of late. I am considerably ruined; but hope to recover soon again.</p>
<p>We have had Mr James and Mrs ever since the day predicted, who are apt to keep us terrib<supplied>[l]</supplied>y<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> back at dinner. Mrs James is very large and <hi rend="italic">interesting;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pregnant with the first of their four children, Victor A. E.

She invites me strongly to Coniston,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their country home, Monk Coniston, by the lake.</note> but I decline. James Spedding and Pollock are to go instead.

Yesternight, for example, all Keswick Parish was invited to tea, and literally about 200 took it; Monteagle (it was in the Infants School room) handed the sugar, with many Marshall millionnaires, Cambridge tutors and other Laking<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Visiting the Lake District.</note> notabilities in presence; then the &#x0201C;harmonious blacksmith&#x0201D; lectured on astronomy,&#x02014;learned <foreign>galimathias</foreign> [nonsense] unintelligible to the Parish, and the Parson (a young foolish admirer of mine) winded up with <pb id="pg-13-247" n="13:247"/>a tritical essay on things in general, deadly tedious; after which a a<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, as is &#x0201C;tritical.&#x0201D;</note> <foreign>soiree</foreign> at <hi rend="italic">his</hi> house, with &#x00026;c &#x00026;c&#x02014;<foreign>ach Gott!</foreign></p>
<p>To conclude, dear Goody, I am heartily glad to get off dressed dinners again, and back into authentically ugly country where I can hope to be <hi rend="italic">at rest</hi>.&#x02014; <closer><salute>Write my dear; write to Scotsbrig any way. Thine ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>Tomorrow, that is Wednesday, if nothing misgo, I am to get into that same Royal Victoria Keswick Coach, and endeavour to get back to the Carlisle Coffee house Inn again. The unfortunate Royal Victoria, perhaps the slowest coach now running, leaves Keswick about six in the morning, too early an hour;&#x02014;but as it has to go round 9 miles by Cockermouth, and drives so very deliberately, my kind Landlord here has undertaken to drive me along by a direct road in his own gig some 12 miles, whereby we shall intersect the slow Coach in its <hi rend="italic">mid</hi> career (at a place called Cock Bridge, six miles on <hi rend="italic">our</hi> side of Wigton); and so have liberty to stay here till about <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> o&#x02019;clock, and come along with much less lumbering. I find it a very obliging procedure.</p>
<p>Our Royal Victoria arrives in Carlisle I understand about noon: I am busy thinking with myself whether there is or is not any coach to Ecclefechan till 5 in the evening? Whether there is not some Opposition Vehicle at a much earlier hour? The prospect of waiting 5 hours in Carlisle with nothing whatever to do is none of the cheerfullest: but how can we help it? Could I but find you and Donald, yoked there, as I left you! But that is not very likely;&#x02014;nay I know not whether you will get this Letter in time to make it possible. Perhaps too you are busy, making hay or the like: if so, think not of it for a moment.&#x02014; In short I know not what the value of Donald&#x02019;s time and yours is on Wednesday; I know only that the Coach will bring me up for some 7 shillings, and that the Misery of waiting five hours in a peaceable city cannot be considered intense.&#x02014; Spedding is not likely to miss the Victoria tomorrow; nay I think there is a Whitehaven Coach some <pb id="pg-13-248" n="13:248"/>hours after even if he did. One way or other I am likely to get into Carlisle in excellent time for the evening Glasgow Coach; and I suppose at bottom it will be real folly to think of driving a gig and horse so far, even if you do (which is very uncertain) get this Letter <hi rend="italic">tonight</hi>, and in good time. Therefore do not think of it; only expect to see me at Scotsbrig, and tell my Mother of me.</p>
<p>I got Jean&#x02019;s Letter forwarded by Alick. I have heard nothing from Templand nor from the Doctor, tho&#x02019; rather expecting word these three days.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; I have seen nearly all the people I meant to see hereabouts, and even some more, tho&#x02019; in a rather different order: all has gone off well,&#x02014;and I am glad to have it done!&#x02014; <closer><salute>No more at present, dear Jamie</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>No answer has come from you to my Keswick Letter; which a little disappoints me. Perhaps you only <hi rend="italic">had no matches</hi>, and did not like writing till they came? I hope it will be nothing of a worse sort. One Letter of yours<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1841-08-31">31 Aug.</date></note> did come; in answer to my Scotsbrig one: I think it was the day after mine went away. I have had a notice that our Sister Jean&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">breast</hi> was in the way of recovery: nothing else out of Annandale; from my Wife, these four days, nothing at all. Perhaps I may still get a Letter from you today: in that case it will be sent after me to Scotsbrig. That, at present, is the best address I can give you.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning it is fixed that I go off; an ugly journey from which my laziness repugns. I get to Carlisle about noon; after waiting there till five, a coach will take me up to Ecclefechan.</p>
<p>I have seen all the people I expected in this region, so far as that was possible; and can consider my poor purpose in it as accomplished: <foreign><hi rend="italic">tant mieux</hi></foreign> [so much the better]. I was on the top of Skiddaw on Sunday.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Pollock walked down Skiddaw with TC, who &#x0201C;talked all the way down about shams and windbags, and how Burns ought to have been king of England, and how George the Third ought to have been the exciseman. But he was more severe about Parliaments and parliamentary representation, and voting for members, and all the apparatus that belonged to it, including the registration of voters.&#x0201D; TC knew that Pollock, as a revising barrister, was shortly to work on the lists of voters in E Cumberland and he &#x0201C;chaffed and laughed at me in the heartiest and absurdest of ways.&#x0201D; TC also went to church, where, &#x0201C;never having been present at the service of the Church of England before,&#x0201D; he was &#x0201C;curious and attentive about everything&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Personal Remembrances</hi> 1:178, 179&#x02013;80).</note> We have had some three dry days; one of them, yesterday, an almost <pb id="pg-13-249" n="13:249"/>preternaturally bright one. I was over at Hallsteads on Ullswater at the house of the elder Marshalls; but only for a night: our times did not suit for my ending with their house, and getting home by Penrith, as I at first proposed. We had a grand Mechanics-Institute <foreign>soiree</foreign>, last night, Whewell the huge Cantab lecturing to the rustics on astronomy! Some wild Cambridge students, at present rusticating here, let off rockets &#x00026;c in honour of the occasion. The Monteagles are here, a great bevy of people are here; four besides myself are in this house. I am right glad that I have not to stand the racket much longer: but shall get to repose again in a little.</p>
<p>From Scotsbrig I will write whether I hear or not. Jane I suppose is getting impatient to be let away. I too must shrink away back to Chelsea before long. Every fox to its hole,&#x02014;especially the sick fox. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Jack.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear</salute>
<p>You <hi rend="italic">would</hi> get a letter from me on Tuesday, I trust&#x02014;to show at all events that I was not <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>&#x02014; &#x0201C;The devil fly away with&#x0201D; such posts!&#x02014; I congratulate you on having <hi rend="italic">done</hi> your visiting with so little scathe and congratulate myself that I was not with you&#x02014;the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gorb</hi></foreign> [unfledged bird] <supplied>[o]</supplied>f a M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Spedding and &#x0201C;interesting&#x0201D; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> James&#x02014;and all the rest of them in my present state of nervousness would have driven me to despair&#x02014;</p>
<p>I dare say you are right in proposing to meet me at Dumfries rather than to come on here&#x02014;this place is so antipathetical to you&#x02014; My Mother talked of going so far as Dumfries with me at any rate, and so it is &#x0201C;probably just as well&#x0201D;&#x02014;</p> 
<p>For the <hi rend="italic">time;</hi> I do not see what good is to be done by staying any longer&#x02014;now that I have fairly seen my Mother&#x02014; I have read out all my books, and my slipper begins to be <hi rend="italic">intolerable</hi>&#x02014; Harriet is anxiously expecting me at Tynemouth&#x02014;Helen anxiou<supplied>[s]</supplied>ly expecting me at Chelsea&#x02014; <pb id="pg-13-250" n="13:250"/>And so if it suits you I should like to be met on Monday at Dumfries&#x02014;and forwarded to Carlisle with your earliest convenience&#x02014; If <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are not going yet&#x02014;it will be all the better that I should get home before you&#x02014;to spread a little air of comfort over the &#x0201C;Barren Wilderness,&#x0201D; and give you a welcome when you arrive&#x02014;</p>
<p>I shall be heartily glad to awake some morning and find myself in my own red bed&#x02014;after all this tumbling ab<supplied>[o]</supplied>ut</p>
<p>Helen said some books were come from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Frasers and the boy told her he was &#x0201C;very bad&#x02014;no life expected&#x0201D;&#x02014; Poor James&#x02014;how one <hi rend="italic">likes</hi> him now! I wrote to Helen yesterday and sent her half a sovereign in case of her being reduced to the horrible predicament of having neither money nor credit!&#x02014;</p>
<p>That abominable Miss Sedgwick has printed all manner of impertinences about her visit to <hi rend="italic">England</hi>&#x02014;&#x0201C;her impression is that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> live in a rather humble way&#x0201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catharine Maria Sedgwick (<date when="1789">1789</date>&#x02013;<date when="1867">1867</date>), New England novelist; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390529-TC-RWE-01"><sic>11:119</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1839-05-29">29 May 1839</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>Dear Jeannie,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came last night, thro&#x02019; the pouring rain; your other Letter also got to Keswick on the afternoon before my setting off; that is, a few hours after I had written. Thanks to you.&#x02014; I got well home; the good Spedding<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas.</note> conveying me 12 miles, in spite of weather and too early hours, in his gig, to intercept my lumbering Coach: he is the kindest of men, and one of the sensiblest I have seen for years; a far better judgement and deeper eyesight than his Brother,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James.</note> who produces himself much more. I looked at Carlisle Cathedral, at Carlisle Castle; after infinite fiddling, got at last on a Coach; Alick and Jamie were waiting for me at Ecclefechan, and it had all wound itself up well. I had looked into Borrowdale, been on the top of Skiddaw, seen all manner of Marshalls &#x00026;c that were visible, and so could lie down to sleep in peace. Two wet days of absolute silence, two good sleeps and one not bad, have greatly set me up again; and I am ready for a new enterprise,&#x02014;that of getting home, I think, as the wisest of all!</p>
<p>I will meet you on Monday at Dumfries; before two o&#x02019;clock I expect to be heard of at Sister Jean&#x02019;s, who is now better. You will find me there when you come at 3; if, as is likelier, I have not found <hi rend="italic">you</hi> before, waiting for you at the Coach. Or perhaps if Mother come with you, you will come in some <foreign>chaise</foreign>? Jean&#x02019;s about 2 o&#x02019;clock is the surest <foreign>rendezvous</foreign> I can give you. We ought to start as soon after three as possible. You will find a neat enough little rustic room here with a fire, with a good bed; and none to meddle with you. Poor Jenny keeps herself in the other end of the house, or down stairs: many children float about, but none get admittance here.</p>
<p>As to the weather on Monday: if it should be only <hi rend="italic">showery</hi>, we must not mind it at all. If it should prove a streaming all-day deluge, such as we have had often enough, you seeing it so at noon had better not stir: have a line sent down to Jean by the guard of the Coach; and we will consider that the adventure stands over, altogether as before, for the morrow. But I think you will come. And so good luck to poor Goody!</p>
<p>We are waiting here this third day for seasonable weather, my Mother and I to get over to Gill, and consult the Austins about a winter <pb id="pg-13-252" n="13:252"/>lodging for Jenny. This day, the last possible otherwise, is understood to promise well; and they wait only till I have done writing, to yoke the gig, and let us be off. So enough!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Miss Sedgwick seems to be the commonplace unwonderful wonder she looked to be. Her impertinences will gratify the reading public; which ought not to blame what it likes and wishes. Our &#x0201C;rather humble way&#x0201D; is a truth, tho&#x02019; a gigmanic <foreign><hi rend="italic">niaiserie</hi></foreign> [foolishness]. I was not aware that I had &#x0201C;preternaturally bright eyes,&#x0201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Miss Sedgwick had said that &#x0201C;his eyes have a preternatural brilliancy&#x0201D; (1:85).</note>&#x02014;the real fact is that owing to bilious and other causes they are rather muddy eyes! &#x0201C;<foreign>Canaille</foreign> [Rabble]!&#x0201D; with a grunt, Cavaignac would say.&#x02014;&#x02014; <closer><salute>Enough <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, dear Jeannie, Goody.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letters<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Only one has been found, of <date when="1841-09-01">1 Sept.</date></note> have all come: two to me here, the last of them two days ago, and then last night one to my Mother with your address at Worthing. I wrote to you a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> time from Keswick: there is no conclusive light from your Letters whether you have got that. It was addressed as before, &#x0201C;St Leonard&#x02019;s,&#x0201D; and will be lying there if you still need to apply. Should it be altogether lost, I do not think the damage will be great; there were no secrets or even news in it; simply the announcement that I was off from Keswick, and had not heard from you there.</p>
<p>It was Wednesday last, as predicted, when I arrived here. Tolerable weather, from the middle of rain, was again granted me: Jamie and Alick stood waiting on the slope of the &#x0201C;Hags,&#x0201D; about five O&#x02019;clock in the moist evening sun, as my vehicle, named <hi rend="italic">Rapid</hi>, came whirling in; and that friendly expedition to the Lake country had handsomely terminated. All was well here: in a considerable hubbub, owing to Jenny&#x02019;s children being shifted down stairs for me; but all heartily glad at my return. Jenny seems to behave herself very well here: the houseroom is defective; but they must put up with it till a new term, I believe; my Mother and I went over to Gill, inquiring how it stood with the new houseroom at Mary&#x02019;s, where poor Jenny thought she might better hide,&#x02014;but we found plasterers still working, nothing but damp <pb id="pg-13-253" n="13:253"/>and chill to be looked for (especially in the two vacant rooms) all winter, and so we concluded it would by no means do. Rob<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Hanning.</note> is off, to Lancashire or somewhither; none mentions the name of him: Jenny in secret, it is thought, has not yet quitted hope. I will leave some money with her before I go, and commit her to her own good sense and the affection of her friends. Poor little Jenny!&#x02014;</p>
<p>I went yesterday; met Jane at Dumfries, and brought her hither, where she now is. The confusion we occasion is sufficient to warn us, in harvest weather, that we ought not to linger. I too am weary of tossing about; long to be at anchor even in Chelsea. The morning after tomorrow we propose to embark for Carlisle; thence along to Tynemouth, where an interview with poor Harriet has long been promised to Jane: I myself am obliged to admit that I too ought to go. So be it. I go down to Annan, to sort up my Bank matters with Ben Nelson (my Mother goes with me for a ride in the gig, the weather being dry); tomorrow I will perhaps try to make out Burnswark; then the next morning (Thursday) about half past six&#x02014;off! Poor Grahame has just lost his elder Sister, Mrs. Howatson, after long sickness: Jamie and Alick were up with the funeral at Dalgarnock, close by Templand, while I was in Cumberland.</p>
<p>Mazzini had written an Article about me, and offered it to Kemble; an Article in K&#x02019;s review is accordingly announced, and tho&#x02019; Mazzini has had no answer, it is not Mazzini&#x02019;s. Very scandalous usage to poor M.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For J. M. Kemble and for Mazzini&#x02019;s article, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410706-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1841-07-06">6 July</date>]</ref>.

<p>Jean&#x02019;s breast was about well again; all going reasonably well with her and hers. Mrs Welsh came down with Jane yesterday; and glided out almost by stealth, feeling I suppose that she could no longer otherwise avoid a scene. I was truly sorry, with a kind sorrow.&#x02014; My Mother has given me your address to copy: the &#x0201C;comb&#x0201D; did not come yet; I suppose Alick has it. Address next to Chelsea: we shall be there about Sunday, I conjecture; there is railway, but not the most commodious,&#x02014;by Leeds, Derby, Rugby, I believe. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>The Post will go away tomorrow morning at eight; so I write a word before going to bed, that it may go with him for your sake and my own. I have been talking, and again talking, all evening, with poor Miss Martineau, and my wits are all scattered to pieces; but my good Mother will take the will for the deed. This morning a <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> with two strokes went off, which I hope will perhaps already have indicated (at least <hi rend="italic">already</hi> to Alick) that we are here safe; and indeed as yet there is little more to be indicated.</p>
<p>We got beautifully down to Carlisle soon after one o&#x02019;clock; the man of the luggage was there waiting; at half past two he was to be off again,&#x02014;too short a rest for the poor Nag; who however, I hope, got home again without much injury. Jamie was to take him over to Austin the first day he could manage it; and so wind that matter up.&#x02014; At half past two, their <hi rend="italic">omnibus</hi> had landed us in the railway machine, which proved somewhat of a <hi rend="italic">jolty</hi> one, being too light-laden as I thought; however, we had the more room, and the greater freedom, and being in the open class of carriages with a beautiful afternoon we did very well; tho&#x02019; half past <hi rend="italic">six</hi>, not half past five as advertised, was the time of our arriving at Newcastle We had dined out of our tin-box, on the bread and fowl, which served us very well, in the case we were in. It was an interesting ride: for a good while, Burnswark stood frequently in view, and we fancied you all as busy about the foot of it,&#x02014;my good Mother rejoicing more than any in the bright day, for our and all men&#x02019;s sake: but at last Burnswark too vanished behind the Hills, and all that too was gone and away. Ought we not to be glad that we have been permitted to <hi rend="italic">meet</hi> once again under this sun? Let us all think of each other with love and grateful affection, and strive to banish the pain,&#x02014;which, alas, will not altogether banish.</p>
<p>At half past eight thro&#x02019; two new omnibuses and another ten miles of railway, we had got landed here: an excellent lodging not far off over the way had been secured for us by Miss Martineau&#x02019;s landlady: thither about ten o&#x02019;clock we were glad enough to retreat. A little drop of brandy-punch sent us to sleep in our braw double-bedded room; and this day&#x02019;s rest, one of the finest sunniest days, has set us all up again, or nearly so. The lodging cannot be too much commended: even taken by the <hi rend="italic">day</hi> it is somewhat cheaper (4 shillings a day) than our <pb id="pg-13-255" n="13:255"/>Newby one taken by the three months; and the accommodation here is complete according to quite another standard than the Slater one. We have a fine sitting room down below; and up above two of the cleanest comfortablest beds anywhere to be met with. It is a pleasant quiet kind of town (more like Moffat than any in your region,&#x02014;a wide clear street with high weatherbeaten houses, but close upon the cliffs of the sea), the weather is pleasant, and the sea is full of beauty, and very fit for bathing yet. All this has decided us on staying here over Sunday at any rate; I have been in the sea today, a sea as clear as glass; I never had a finer bathe. Jane too got a <hi rend="italic">hot</hi> bath of sea-water somewhere: in short here we are, I think, till Monday, about as well as we could hope to be, and likely to be fit enough for the remainder of our journey. We think of stopping for the first night at Leeds; then there is but some dozen hours, all railway, till we are at London, and our wandering for the present over. If we stay longer here than Monday, which is by no means likely, I will write to you again. But if Monday be not wet, I think we shall go. About the middle of the week, Thursday or Friday, you may expect some farther news of us.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, what more can I say? My head is all whirling with that endless talk, talk! Poor Miss Martineau seems to me far worse than when I came up in <date when="1841-06">June</date>; much weaker, and with a <hi rend="italic">false</hi> kind of excitement in her manner. The sight of her gives me real sorrow: nor am I sure that our staying here is calculated to do her any good. Accordingly I will see as little of her as I handsomely can, and spend my time in reading, in solitary walking, and a daily plunge in the beautiful salt sea. Jane may take the visiting herself. The weather promises to be good; which I rejoice in for Jamie&#x02019;s sake, and that of all farmers and men. Harvest is not at all over here; perhaps a week ahead of Hoddam or so: the land is all still muddy and wet.&#x02014;&#x02014; Jane is already in bed. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother; I can say no more. <closer><salute>God&#x02019;s blessing be with you and them all. remember me in love, and forgive all my faults. Yours affectionately</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Do not let Jenny forget to send me some word of herself. Study dear Mother to be soft and quiet with her (as I know you will); you yourself have much need of composure.</p></ps>

<p>to sail on Monday by a ship from Liverpool for America.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to Robert Hanning.</note> My Mother was infinitely relieved; Jamie and all the rest of us agreed that there was simply that one chance left for him. I long greatly to hear that <hi rend="italic">he is actually off</hi>. They seemed to have no doubt of it, any of them: but what is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> doubtful about such a character as poor Rob!</p> 
<p>Jenny is to remove to Gill, so soon as they are fairly in their new house there. They are to get coke-cinders, burn chaffing-grates on the floor;&#x02014;it will be horribly damp, I fear: but on the whole there was no other feasible thing for poor Jenny, she herself was bent on it as an inexpressible relief. My Mother and she cannot, for either of their sakes, live together at present; that is clear: my Mother was like being killed by it if it lasted. Jenny will be better there; were her poor Luckless once fairly gone, she might perhaps gradually think of something she could <hi rend="italic">do</hi>,&#x02014;sewing, dress-making, or I know not what; in all which I depend considerably, dear Jean, on <hi rend="italic">your</hi> assisting her. You seem to know her better than any of the rest, except perhaps Jamie, does: poor thing, she certainly deserves all manner of help that any and all of us can afford at present. Pray do you go by and by to Gill; inspect her with your own eyes, and tell me how it goes. She is not in want of money; Jamie says she will have money of her own for a good while: but, alas, there are so many wants besides money.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>For the last three days that Letter of yours containing your future Brighton address has been mislaid among the miscellanea of my pockets: but tonight I have laid hands on it; and just before setting forth from this angle of our pilgrimage I will throw you a word to say how and whither we are and have been bound.</p>
<p>We left Scotsbrig for London by this oblique route on Thursday morning last. Jane had been promised a visit to Miss Martineau in passing: the road seemed so confused, uncertain, that on the whole I found I should go with her. We arrived here, by gig, by railway and omnibus about 8 that same Thursday evening. We were to stay only two nights: but our lodging was so comfortable, the sea and weather were so beautiful, we decided to make it four nights. And so now here we are at the <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> and last; poor Harriet taken leave of; packing done, supper itself finished, and a long journey either to Leeds or to Derby before us on the morrow. We must leave this soon after nine; we start from Newcastle by some coach about 11 for Darlington, a space of 30 miles; there at half past 3 the rail-way receives us, and I must learn from persons better skilled whether Leeds or Derby will be the eligible place to night at. The next day, Tuesday, if all go well, we shall be at Chelsea, and these chaotic wanderings all behind us.&#x02014; This is essentially all I had to write.</p>
<p>The three days I have spent here have been, as near as I could make them, altogether vacant silent ones. To Jane I willingly gave up as much as possible of Harriet&#x02019;s speech; contenting myself with that of the blue sea and the autumn winds. I have bathed daily; I have visited rocks insulated and cavernous; today I had a four-hours walk, over a fine Scotch-looking region, with many <foreign><hi rend="italic">endimanch&#xE9;s</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >People dressed in their Sun. clothes.</note> visible, the strange semi-Annandale dialect of them audible, garnished with the <hi rend="italic">burr</hi>, on all hands of me. It is frightfully smoky; one land of soot and <foreign>reek</foreign>: otherwise a very pretty land. Poor Miss Martineau seems to me not better but weaker than when I saw her last. She gives me real pain, as I now look upon her,&#x02014;her very cheerfulness, so creditable to herself, is painful to me.</p>
<p>All was as before at Scotsbrig; Jamie begun to shear; my Mother much worn by anxieties about Jenny, but otherwise in her common <pb id="pg-13-258" n="13:258"/>health. It is settled now that Jenny is to go to Gill as soon as the house is ready, that is in about a week hence; Rob was to sail for America (would he were fairly there!) &#x0201C;on Tuesday&#x0201D; from Liverpool. It was far the best arrangement we could make. Ah me, ah me!&#x02014; But let us look before, not behind. We <hi rend="italic">must</hi> part with friends, if we have met them.&#x02014; <closer><salute>My dear Brother, I will give you my best blessing and good night, with hopes of soon seeing you.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Without loss of a post I write to put you out of <supplied>[y]</supplied>our<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote &#x0201C;our.&#x0201D;</note> anxieties about us. We arrived here this morning, along with the <hi rend="italic">letters;</hi> that is to say at the railway-end about half past 4, and down to our door rather before 6;&#x02014;all safe without accident or misventure of any kind. Jane did not sleep, nor I either, on the nights before Monday; accordingly she awoke with a very severe headache out of her last <hi rend="italic">attempt</hi> at sleep, and was so miserably ill that we had to put off the business altogether for that day; I bathed another time; wandered about by the shore of the tempestuous sea, and passed another altogether quiet day. The weather was bad, which made me regret our delay less. Yesterday however found us road-ready, and the weather bright: we got off about half past nine; into Newcastle about 11, and there after some <foreign><hi rend="italic">fiking</hi></foreign> [trouble] got upon a coach for Darlington (33 miles), which brought us into the York and London railway about half past 3; and once there, we had only to <hi rend="italic">sit still</hi>. We thought of stopping for the night at York, and then at Derby 90 miles farther on; but our prospects of sleeping seemed so questionable, we decided rather to proceed. So here we are; all safe. Helen roused herself at the first pull of the bell; got us some tea, and washing-water; Jane took instantly to bed, and had to be awoke to take her tea: I got myself into bed about 9, and am just awoke after six hours of sleep. You see we are all in the way to do well.</p>
<p>Among a huge package of Books, messages, Letters &#x00026;c, which lay waiting me, was this shortest of Notes from John. I had already written to him from Tynemouth; he has my Letter, I doubt not, before now.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-259" n="13:259"/>The post-hour has <hi rend="italic">struck;</hi> I have not a moment to lose; I shall even have to walk a mile and a half with this, that it may go off at all.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, therefore, dear Mother, for I will write again very soon.</salute></closer></p>
<p>Tell Jamie the harvest seemed to be nearly over from the time we got to York: the people were carrying some remnants of corn, and mowing their stubble: after York, we lost sight of it and of all things but the night with its stars and railway lanterns and officials. This morning it began raining when we arrived; a rather heavy shower of two hours. I fear poor Jamie and you have the weather bad again in Annandale.</p>
<p>We have often asked ourselves how poor Jenny is, whether her unfortunate husband actually got to sea or not? She must be of courage; all may yet go well. Our affection to one and all of you. <closer><salute>Farewell, dear Mother.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC did his accounts before departure to Scotland and on his return: &#x0201C;<date when="1841-06-29">29 june 1841</date> (ready for setting out to Annan; no accounts kept till now; but, in mind): / rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> (<date when="1840-11">end of Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1840</date> for American <hi rend="italic">Miscel</hi>. sold by Fraser): &#xa3;239.0&#x02014;/ had as above 44 / horse sold 17 / is &#xa3;300 / From America (F.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Returning from a long rustication in the North, I find your two Packets lying here; for which pray accept my thanks. Your two Oxford <pb id="pg-13-260" n="13:260"/>Dignitaries are very interesting scarecrows; hard to say which is uglier,&#x02014;Pusey with his prying suffering contracted weazel-countenance, Sewel with his small triumphant ferret one.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One packet apparently contained Noel&#x02019;s anti-Corn Law pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">A Plea for the Poor</hi> (<date when="1841">1841</date>), the other caricatures of Edward B. Pusey and William Sewell (<date when="1804">1804</date>&#x02013;<date when="1874">74</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25148"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390520-TC-JGL-01"><sic>11:104</sic><corr>TC to JGL, <date when="1839-05-20">20 May 1839</date></corr></ref>); see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410930-TC-TSS-01">TC to <sic>TS</sic><corr>TSS</corr>, <date when="1841-09-30">30 Sept.</date></ref> As an evangelical, Noel would have disapproved of tractarians.</note> The world and Oxford are rarely off for Prophets at present.</p>
<p>Emerson has written no Books except the one you now have. His other publications are separate &#x0201C;Orations,&#x0201D; I think three in number; a little pamphlet called &#x0201C;Nature&#x0201D;; and scattered pieces in reviews, nowhere collected or clearly indicated. The &#x0201C;Orations&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;Nature&#x0201D; can be had, I suppose, by sending to Boston or New York; hardly otherwise: a certain Bookseller, Green, in Newgate street here,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Green, 121 Newgate St.</note> communicates almost weekly with that country, and I doubt not with all Booksellers in this. Perhaps, on the whole, your readiest way of learning what Emerson means will be to re-read that Book of <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> till you see clearly what is in it: the figure of the man is nowhere so distinctly shadowed as there. The figure of his School (for he begins to have a School) is best traceable in the <hi rend="italic">Dial</hi>, a small quarterly publication,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Founded, <date when="1840">1840</date>, as the organ of the American transcendental movement.</note> which I imagine Green regularly imports. A most shadowy shadow this latter;&#x02014;the opposite pole of Puseyism, not less notable and far less miserable than it: a real living <hi rend="italic">soul,</hi> but without body, and obliged to go about as ghost; contrasted with an arrogant <hi rend="italic">suit of clothes</hi> pretending to exist comfortably without either body or soul!&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014;</p>
<p>I never came to visit the Bodleian; it is now doubtful whether I shall come for the original purpose. I have found many Portraits and <hi rend="italic">Illustrated Graingers</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Named after works such as a <hi rend="italic">Biographical History of England</hi> (<date when="1769">1769</date>) by James Granger (<date when="1723">1723</date>&#x02013;<date when="1776">76</date>), in which blank leaves were left, on which illustrations from various sources could be pasted.</note> here, and can derive but little profit from them.</p>
<p>It gives me pleasure to learn that you are about being settled in your own country in the way that pleases you, in the profession you find a call for. In all professions, on all courses of life, the true and diligent man infinitely differs from the false and slothful. I bid you go on zealously, and do your best with good omens.</p>

<p>It is a most acceptable present you have made me, this of <hi rend="italic">Baillie,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laing&#x02019;s edn. for the Bannatyne Club of the <hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie &#x02026; <date when="1637">1637</date>&#x02013;<date when="1662">1662</date>,</hi> 2 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1841">1841</date>). A third vol. was pbd., <date when="1842">1842</date>.</note> which I find waiting my return here. The Letter, after some wanderings, had already reached me, about two weeks ago, in Cumberland;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1841-08-21">21 Aug.</date>, addressed to TC at Chelsea, forwarded to Newby Cottage and then Templand, where apparently enclosed in one of JWC&#x02019;s letters to TC at Greta Bank.</note> but I delayed answering it till I should see the Book itself. The Book itself is now here, all right and safe: many thanks to you;&#x02014;thanks for this special gift to myself; and thanks in the name of all students of British History for your general gift. It will be a real pleasure to me to recommend this book in all ways I can. I am already cutting it up (in the <hi rend="italic">literal</hi> sense, with a bone folder!) in all quarters, especially in the Appendixes; and hope to glean many useful notices from it. Your pains, which must have been great, are not misspent; Baillie was well worth such trouble: no other more so that I have ever met with in this department of things, except perhaps Spalding alone, who I find has already been cared for.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Spalding, <hi rend="italic">History of the Troubles and Memorable Transactions in Scotland from the Year <date when="1624">1624</date> to <date when="1645">1645</date>,</hi> 2 vols. (Aberdeen, <date when="1792">1792</date>). TC refers to James Sterne&#x02019;s edn. for the Bannatyne Club (Edinburgh, <date when="1828">1828</date>&#x02013;<date when="1829">29</date>).</note></p>
<p>I perceive you have omitted the old meagre <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of Baillie:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Included in Baillie&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals,</hi> 2 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1775">1775</date>).</note> I hope you mean to furnish us with one of your own writing instead? Some short Historical Compend, digested into periods, and exhibiting the general posture of affairs from crisis to crisis,&#x02014;such as might perhaps fitly enough be introduced into a <hi rend="italic">Life of Baillie,</hi>&#x02014;would greatly facilitate the common reader&#x02019;s access to these Letters, increase the circulation of the Book, and be useful to everybody. I will also petition for a good copious <hi rend="italic">Table of Contents,</hi> or even a general <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Persons</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Matters:</hi> this latter, or still more both latter and former, would be a great accommodation.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vol. 3 has an index of names.</note> No Book of that period is so like a File of contemporary Newspapers; which, with an Index is so valuable, and without one is like a filled warehouse without windows or shelves!</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Since I wrote last nothing material has altered with us, nothing at all for the worse; but Jenny&#x02019;s welcome letter, with its good news, arriving last night, reminds me to answer by a word.</p>
<p>We have kept perfectly quiet ever since our return; are getting &#x0201C;window-blinds&#x0201D; and other necessary <hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi> ready,&#x02014;let me hope, for a strenuous winter campaign! I have been too long idle; and shall know no right peace at all till I get handsomely to work again.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; We have continual rains here; I hardly remember a wetter week in London than this last. It began raining when we reached our own door; and daily and nightly there has been frequent pouring ever since. The <supplied>[wind]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> is from the South; we have not here the satisfaction <pb id="pg-13-264" n="13:264"/>of seeing the wet cloudfields gathering in between Criffel and the Cumberland Hills; we see only the fruits of the commotion in torrents out of the black sky. I fear Jamie&#x02019;s good weather does not last! We were greatly surprised by Jenny&#x02019;s intelligence that the weather was at all good there.</p>
<p>On friday night last, we heard a brisk rap at the door; and presently afterwards the Doctor entered! Hale and fresh, with cigars in his pocket; as lively as ever. I explained by word of mouth how <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had not written. He seemed well satisfied with Jenny&#x02019;s resolution, with the course Hanning had now adopted; his feelings towards Jenny are, like those of the rest of us, affectionate sympathy, desire to help her by all ways possible.&#x02014; We made Jack some tea; I walked with him to Hyde Park Corner (half-way to his &#x0201C;H&#xF4;tel&#x0201D;) when it became time to go; and there kindling each a cigar we parted. Next day we saw no more of him; they had returned to Brighton. A railway has just been opened thither: with plenty of money people can fly to and fro that way at a great rate; they do the journey in less than two hours, by the best trains, tho&#x02019; the distance is about sixty miles. Jack said he thought they might stay there some three weeks, and then probably come up to London for the winter. His Patient, he said, got a little more uncomfortable in the country, as the daylight left them, especially if the weather were rainy.</p>
<p>Miss Martineau writes Jane that a celebrated London Doctor,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Charles Clarke (<date when="1782">1782</date>&#x02013;<date when="1857">1857</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5490"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), gynecologist. Harriet Martineau wrote in her journal, <date when="1841-09-24">24 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;Sir C. Clarke came. I could not but admire the frankness with which he told me that my illness is incurable; and I can never again feel health, if his judgement be true. It is strange that this did not move me in the least. &#x02026; I have long disbelieved that I should ever be in health again. &#x02026; At present I fear only the intellectual and moral consequences of a life of confinement&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> [<date when="1877">1877</date>] 3:238). Sir Charles, in a note to T. M. Greenhow, <date when="1841-09-30">30 Sept.</date>, made it clear that her condition, prolapse of the uterus, though inoperable, was not fatal; for this and other details of her illness, see T. M. Greenhow, <hi rend="italic">Medical Report of the Case of Miss H&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; M&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014;</hi> (<date when="1845">1845</date>).</note> passing thro&#x02019; Tynemouth, has examined her case, and pronounces it <hi rend="italic">hopeless</hi> no use in any &#x0201C;operation,&#x0201D; such as was expected hitherto! Poor Harriet affects to take it quite cheerfully; but who can be other than cut to the heart by such an announcement? <hi rend="italic">Our</hi> comfort is that perhaps this celebrated London Doctor knows almost nothing about it!&#x02014; &#x02014;</p>
<p>We wish Jamie had done with his harvest. Are the Gill people<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary and James Austin.</note> actually <hi rend="italic">burning</hi> coal-cinders in the place that is to be Jenny&#x02019;s? Be good to her, poor Jenny! Our love to Isabella; to Alick, and all the rest. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We did not give you up on Saturday, nor even on Sunday: on Sunday, about two o&#x02019;clock, I got myself equipped, and fared forth with an umbrella, thro&#x02019; numerous showers (sheltering myself in doorways during the chief paroxysms) all the way to Berners Street; where I learned that you were gone, the day before. I had left word here that you were to dine with us; but it was, of course, over, then! The London Streets had a curious physiognomy that day while the rain fell. We had nothing for it but Books, in the evening; no Jack there! Craik indeed came in; with a steady <hi rend="italic">light,</hi> but with no radiance in the train of him.</p>
<p>I sleep a very great deal since my return, and as yet, unluckily, that is almost all I do. Daily one meets some new face on the Street; but it is not in these that help can lie for me. I have a feeling that solitude, and private reflexion, will alone be wholesome for me. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Taisons</hi></foreign> [Let us keep quiet]&#x02014; John Sterling is said to be coming up soon. I met W. Cunningham the other day, who told me so; and also that he himself, by aid of his Wife, had realized a little daughter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1841-09-11">11 Sept.</date> William Coningham (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x02013;<date when="1884">84</date>), Sterling&#x02019;s cousin (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391024-TC-MAC-01"><sic>11:207</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1839-10-24">24 Oct. 1839</date></corr></ref>), and Elizabeth Coningham, b. Meyrick (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401015-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:287</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-10-15">15 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>).</note> Cunningham looked thin, but perhaps healthier than last time we had met. Darwin has been twice here; but I have missed him both times,&#x02014;only seen him once, in the distance, in his own street. On Sunday, after missing you, I was too dispirited and dull to call there.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; Your Lafarge Memoirs give great satisfaction to the female mind;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Madame Lafarge, written by herself,</hi> 2 vols.

<p>Last night came the enclosed Letter from poor little Jenny. I like the tone of it well, and also the news it brings. I will write to the poor <foreign>Lassie</foreign>, and do you write when you have any good moment.</p>
<p>Had one money enough, Brighton were now almost as near as Bayswater was! The Berners-H&#xF4;tel waiter thought it &#x0201C;very likely indeed <pb id="pg-13-266" n="13:266"/>that the gentlemen would come back:&#x0201D; I heartily hope it may be so.</p>
<p>The rain is all but perpetual here; one dare not go out except fortified with an umbrella. I am surprised, by Jenny&#x02019;s Letter, to hear of good weather in Annandale; and fear it cannot last. The wet South pours out continual showers on us. I am getting <hi rend="italic">cloth blinds</hi> for my three windows here to shut out altogether the landscape, or rather <hi rend="italic">brick</hi>scape and <hi rend="italic">rubbishs</hi>cape of Chelsea and its doings. I am myself my own salvation or perdition.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had returned to face the problems of writing about Cromwell or his period. There were difficulties: the problem that, in spite of wide reading, he had not mastered the field; uncertainty about the need to write history; and an inability to find the right form and subject. Notes in the Forster MS: ff. 107r.&#x02014; 108v. show that he was making himself write without knowing what to write about. Under the heading &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Oliver Cromwell</hi> (<date when="1841-09-27">27 Sept<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> 1841</date>; Monday 1&#xBD; p.m.)!&#x02014;&#x0201D; he begins: &#x0201C;O Oliver, my hero, can I by no alchemy extricate thee from the dim cave, where buried under Presbyterian, Royalist and other obsolete rubbish thou liest unintelligible, all defaced, unrecognisable! Thou art become a most gaunt, spectral nondescript; little other than a ghastly chimera. Yet of a very truth thou wert no chimera. Alas, neither was thy Time chimerical. A most rugged, real, hard-struggling Time; when the sun shone on heroic toil of men &#x02026; fighting with all weapons the battle of the brave.&#x02014; (Awful trash!)&#x0201D; These notes are followed (f.108r. and v.) by a lengthy sketch, &#x0201C;Oliver Cromwell as a Drama.&#x0201D; See K.

It would seem that these and other drafts of various kinds, were experiments to find the right form; see K. J.

<p>Does any of you know that Belfast Lady; Authoress of a rather notable little Book which has arrived here?

Sarah was unharmed. Blakesley was charged with murdering Burdon (who had died from his wounds) and stabbing Sarah and Eliza. He confessed, &#x0201C;I did not mean to hurt Burdon or his wife. I intended to murder my own wife and then kill myself, and if Burdon had not come between us he would not have been hurt.&#x0201D; He was hanged, <date when="1841-11-15">15 Nov.</date>, and Sarah d. of a seizure after being told of her husband&#x02019;s execution.</note>&#x02014; how many things the impartial stars look down on!

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your <foreign>braw</foreign> gray Glengarry Cap;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A flat-sided woolen cap.</note> which, greatly to the surprise of the Postman, arrived yesterday. Jane called me down stairs specially to look at it, to say what it could be: for the general rule is, that I am not to come down for Letters, but stay here at my work till the day&#x02019;s task is done; the Postman flings in his ware thro&#x02019; a slit we have contrived for him, and passes on without so much as knocking. I tore open the package, and disclosed our new Glengarry! It fits excellently well, is much approved of in regard to appearance; and indeed will altogether fulfil very well the function of a winter-cap. What is singular, I had just two days before sent word to Alick that he must get me the best attainable Glengarry, and put it in along with cargo of Scotsbrig meal. Had you waited till then, you might have saved your sixteen-pence of postage!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The rate was one penny for one-half oz., with a limit of sixteen ozs.</note> It is a queer thing this penny post.&#x02014; As to the comb, it was not mine at all but our Mother&#x02019;s: if I can get it done here, I will send it back to her by a similar conveyance.</p>
<p>We are going on very tolerably since our return; as quiet as possible, much quieter than we anywhere were in the country. There are hitherto only few acquaintances got back to Town: on the whole, I often say, the fewer the better! Jane is busy getting carpets, window-blinds and other equipments, chiefly for this my &#x0201C;Library,&#x0201D; ready against the winter campaign: I feel a terrible necessity for getting to some sort of real effectual labour, and my hand, alas, is much out. There is nothing for it but to <hi rend="italic">bore</hi> away; to insist upon succeeding, and take no denial.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x02019;s comments in his Journal, <date when="1841-10-03">3</date> and <date when="1841-10-04">4 Oct.</date>, on his progress: &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Ought</hi> I to write now of Oliver Cromwell? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gott weiss</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">;</hi> I cannot yet see clearly: I have been scrawling somewhat during the last week; but entirely without effect.&#x0201D; He recorded his reading: &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Kames&#x02019;s Life</hi> by Tytler read yesterday: milk-and-water regimen, better than zero. Seward&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Darwin: ditto</hi> with the addition of some most singular cordial drops (Lichfield peppermint, English <foreign>eau-de-cologne</foreign> or I know not what), making simply the strangest draught I have had for years! Mean to read the <hi rend="italic">Botanic Garden,</hi> and get to know Darwin a little. Scotch Book of Archaeology on Catherine Moor (More or Muir): trash&#x0201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:223&#x02013;24 prints a slightly different text).</note></p>
<p>We had the Doctor here one night about a week ago; he had come running up, he and his Patient and another of their party, from Brighton by a new railway just opened; they went down again next day. It is sixty miles off; but the journey is accomplished in less than two <pb id="pg-13-270" n="13:270"/>hours. Very fast travelling;&#x02014;nay I heard last night that there had been a fatal frightful accident already on that railway, and several lives lost; but none of our people, thank Heaven, could be concerned in it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The London &#x00026; Brighton Railway had opened, <date when="1841-09-21">21 Sept.</date>, and on <date when="1841-10-02">Sat., 2 Oct.</date>, the derailment of a train nr. Hayward&#x02019;s Heath killed four. An inquest was held, <date when="1841-10-05">5 Oct.</date></note> Jack seemed well and hearty; his work nothing worse than <hi rend="italic">wearisome:</hi> he thought it likely they would return hither in a fortnight or so (from the present date), and take a house for the winter. We had a Newspaper from him yesterday.</p>
<p>Poor James Fraser the Bookseller is dead; on Saturday last,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1841-10-02">2 Oct.</date>; see &#x0201C;The Late Mr. Fraser,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x02019;s Magazine</hi> 24 (<date when="1841-11">Nov.</date>):628&#x02013;30.</note> after long sickness: I know not how my affairs stand on his Books&#x02014;but I expect that all will be straight and correct there: poor James; it is a mournful and a solemn thing for me, this loss of him in middle course; I think he could only be some five and thirty; he was an innocent-hearted, <foreign><hi rend="italic">gleg</hi></foreign> [eager], accurate little man. Ah me!</p>
<p>Your account of Jenny and the rest is very welcome to me. I shall depend on you chiefly for news especially about such matters. The chief thing I apprehend for Jenny at present is the frightful <hi rend="italic">dampness</hi> of the new Gill house. I left some directions about getting a <foreign><hi rend="italic">chauffer</hi></foreign> [portable stove] and coke-cinders to burn in it, before she should enter the place: if you or James can afford any furtherance there, pray do it. Rob is got well away; he <hi rend="italic">may</hi> perhaps improve where he is. You must go down and see Jenny with your eyes before very long, and report to me.&#x02014; I understand your &#x0201C;pa<supplied>[v]</supplied>ing of granite,&#x0201D; and approve of it!&#x02014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Jean.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Accept a fraction of a Letter once more, since there is nothing better to give you. I am ill off; I cannot get on with any work, and have to sit daily, trying, trying,&#x02014;altogether refusing to be turned back. It is a necessary, but one of the miserablest processes. Nothing but trial, and success, can convince me that I have any intellect at all left at present.</p>
<p>Your Letter came, and the Newspapers; no W. Ogilvie and no <pb id="pg-13-271" n="13:271"/>Books have yet come to light. Perhaps he discovered Sterling&#x02019;s address? It is &#x0201C;2. South Place Knightsbridge.&#x0201D; John Sterling is in his own residence at Falmouth, I believe; threatening always to come off for a visit to London, but never yet coming. The old Stimabile<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Sterling.</note> comes very little here at present, and I in particular have never yet seen him: he turns out to be mortally offended at some quizzical response of mine to a Letter of his received at Newby;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1841-08-02">2 Aug.</date></note> I forget nearly all I said, but remember clearly that I was in good humour towards him, and fancy it must have been banter which he has taken in earnest; he is now engaged in that salutory Scotch process of &#x0201C;cooling in the skin that he grew hot in.&#x0201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scots proverb (Kelly 8).</note></p>
<p>Yesterday in the middle of my work, there walked in&#x02014;John Gordon!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(D. <date when="1882">1882</date>), general sec. of Edinburgh Univ., since <date when="1833">1833</date>; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270329-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:201</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-03-29">29 March 1827</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320528-TC-MN-01"><sic>6:168</sic><corr>TC to MN, <date when="1832-05-28">28 May 1832</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400501-TC-TA-01"><sic>12:129</sic><corr>TC to TA, <date when="1840-05-01">1 May 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> I am right sorry you were not here, that I might have handed him over to <hi rend="italic">you!</hi> He looks well, poor John: talks rationally, tho&#x02019; in stinted quantity, and has his old explosive laugh. We have asked him to dinner for today: I think he is about returning very speedily.</p>
<p>Dr Chalmers sent me a Book on <hi rend="italic">Pauperism</hi> with a civil Letter;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1841-09-29">29 Sept.</date> Thomas Chalmers (<date when="1780">1780</date>&#x02013;<date when="1847">1847</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5033"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), theologian and church leader; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270913-JWC-JAC-01"><sic>4:260</sic><corr>JWC to JAC, <date when="1827-09-13">13 Sept. 1827</date></corr></ref>. He had sent <hi rend="italic">On the Sufficiency of the Parochial System, Without a Poor Rate, for the Right Management of the Poor</hi> (Glasgow, <date when="1841">1841</date>).</note> to which, alas, I shall have an answer to write. I have received also from the Irish Miss Macdonald a very indistinct light-weighted &#x0201C;Essay on <hi rend="italic">Educators</hi>.&#x0201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410928-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1841-09-28">28 Sept.</date></ref></note> These &#x0201C;&#x02019;Cators&#x0201D; Jane said, are rather a fatal people! All this, with a visit from Scott, and a whole bundle of Newspapers &#x00026;c, coming on me in one day, was too much. Of the &#x0201C;&#x00026;c&#x0201D; I send you only one Prentice&#x02019;s &#x0201C;Supplement extraordinary,&#x0201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Archibald Prentice (<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x02013;<date when="1857">1857</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22717"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Times</hi>. He had rpt. Noel&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">A Plea for the Poor</hi> in his newspaper, <date when="1841-08-07">7 Aug.</date>, and excerpts from <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution,</hi> <date when="1841-10-02">2 Oct.</date>, as &#x0201C;Revolutionary Reminiscences for the Party employing Sir Robert Peel&#x0201D; (sent to TC&#x02019;s mother; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411012-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1841-10-12">12 Oct.</date></ref>), which were then rpt. as a pamphlet, the &#x0201C;supplement extraordinary&#x0201D; sent to John.</note> which perhaps you will think curious at present.</p>
<p>Scott (of Woolwich, it was he I saw yesterday) is lecturing about Pentonville in these weeks; on something about Social Philosophy and Christianity, I think.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rev. A. J. Scott was repeating nine lectures, <hi rend="italic">Social Systems of the Present Day, Compared with Christianity</hi> (<date when="1841">1841</date>), contrasting chartism, socialism, conservatism, and anglo-catholicism with what he considered the true social principles of Christianity, already given at Woolwich, <date when="1840-12">Dec. 1840</date> to <date when="1841-02">Feb.</date> Presumably he was giving them in the Pentonville area, not &#x0201C;about&#x0201D; the prison, not yet known by that name, though to be opened in <date when="1842">1842</date>.</note> The topic to me is not interesting. Darley, whom <pb id="pg-13-272" n="13:272"/>I saw one day, stuttering rather worse than ever, is engaged on a Tragedy actually meant for the Stage: Macready is to bring it out this very season, and Darley considers himself to have it &#x0201C;h-h-half done.&#x0201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Darley&#x02019;s third verse play was apparently never finished. Macready did, however, produce a play by his brother, the Rev. Charles Frederick Darley, <hi rend="italic">Plighted Troth; or, a Woman her own Rival</hi> (<date when="1842">1842</date>), which failed after one performance at Drury Lane, <date when="1842-04-20">20 April 1842</date>.</note> One is really rather glad for poor Darley&#x02019;s sake: if he were to succeed, it might prove the best activity that could now be got out of him.</p>
<p>I have never been at Fraser&#x02019;s shop yet; I wished to let the Funeral be over. Poor Fraser is a greater sorrow to me than I thought he could have been&#x02014; Last night I walked up that street (taking the air): &#x0201C;How often has poor James stept along here, and his little pilgrimage is done now&#x02014;done!&#x0201D;</p>
<p>I have heard no word from Annandale.</p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Your new Letter has arrived before the sealing of this. All right;&#x02014;alas, I have lost another day, which is <hi rend="italic">all wrong!</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude (3:324) explained TC&#x02019;s difficulty &#x0201C;in beginning &#x02018;Cromwell&#x02019;&#x0201D; as mainly due to a wish to say something &#x0201C;about the present time.&#x0201D; This is less than a half truth. The Forster MS, f.105r. and v. show him still trying to find a way through experimentally dramatizing scenes (this time on &#x0201C;Jenny Geddes&#x0201D;), rambling off into general observations, ending with a ballad of his own composition, &#x0201C;The lasses of the Canongate may kaim their yellow hair,&#x0201D; and the note &#x02018;<date when="1841-10-07">7<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1841</date> [twice underlined].&#x02014; Dull still, as ditchwater and dark as chaos!&#x0201D; A little earlier he comments, &#x0201C;this is dreadful work,&#x0201D; &#x0201C;<foreign>Ay de mi</foreign>,&#x0201D; and writes: &#x0201C;Oliver like an iceberg. Grim thunder lodged in him. Who told thee great men were &#x02018;amiable&#x02019;? &#x02018;Loveable&#x02019;? Yes; but the lover must be given as well as the thing to be loved.&#x02014; [My hand was no day more completely out. I am very miserable. Were it not for the rain, I should forth and walk.&#x02014; At bottom, what <hi rend="italic">do</hi> I want with Oliver? A certain love for the man I do feel. &#x02026; But alas, alas. Some toil has been funded in the enterprise now. &#x02026; Or should I give it up once for all? I wish to Heaven I were fairly in it, or in some thing. <hi rend="italic">This</hi> will no longer do!]&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s square brackets). A genuine history, he continued, cannot be written without understanding what men believed in: &#x0201C;But suppose the phenomenon were not the new Book, the new ministerial Harangue; but human life itself, the summary of all phenomena whatsoever! To utter this, the complete meaning of this, the tongue of archangels were inadequate: what shall a poor detached individual utter concerning it? It is as high as Heaven, what canst thou know; it is as deep as Hell, what canst thou understand? Alas, all men, with their united wisdom in all times and places, stand foiled before this mystic tablet; can decipher but a word here and there of its prophetic meaning.&#x0201D;&#x02014; That is to say, a true history is unwritable; hence his almost desperate search for the right form for Cromwell or his period; but he cannot have supposed he would really write a play or intersperse his work with ballads.</note></p></ps>

<dateline>Monday (<date when="1841-10-11">11<hi rend="italic">th Oct.,</hi> 1841</date>)</dateline>
<p>Who could have foretold, dearest Helen, in marking the fine glow of cousinly enthusiasm with which I perused your Newby letter, that I should only for the first time acknowledge it in the month of <date when="1841-10">October</date>! Alas, sweet one, there are depths of inconsistency in human nature which human nature&#x02019;s self stands astounded before, when it is at the pains to fathom them! For my part, I own at once, I am born to fallibility as the sparks fly upwards!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 5:7.</note> &#x0201C;But then,&#x0201D; as a certain old woman of Haddington told some charity-ladies who were reproaching her with her shortcomings, &#x0201C;but then, dear <foreign><hi rend="italic">hinnies</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">honeys</hi>], <hi rend="italic">I repent a great deal!</hi>&#x0201D; I assure you I have <hi rend="italic">repented</hi> late and early of the damnatory fact above mentioned&#x02014;and it has required all the illusions I could make to myself, of its being <hi rend="italic">superfluous</hi> to write from Templand, whence others were sending bulletins world without end,&#x02014;of its being <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> to write from Tynemouth, where Harriet Martineau exhausted in talk my every particle of intellect, imagination, and common sense,&#x02014;of its being next to mad to think of writing from here, while everything about me is in a transition state&#x02014;old things giving place to new&#x02014;a house blooming forth in new carpets and our &#x0201C;rather humble way&#x0201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Catharine Sedgwick&#x02019;s comment, <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410909-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1841-09-09">9 Sept.</date>]</ref></note> getting itself improved into a certain modest <hi rend="italic">respectability</hi>&#x02014;it has required, I can tell you, all these flattering unctions to my soul to enable it to sustain its load of self-reproach in thinking of my shameful silence towards <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> kindest of cousins and <foreign>bonny</foreign> white-skinned Missy!</p>
<p>Happily when I do write I have no ill news to tell you. Since my return to London I have been gradually recovering from the nervous excitement occasioned by the winds and waves and &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">industrious</hi> fleas&#x0201D; and other unimaginable horrors of my husband&#x02019;s &#x0201C;realised ideal&#x0201D; &#x0201C;a cottage by the sea-shore!&#x0201D; It went hard with me at Newby&#x02014;another month of it and I must have lost my wits or taken to drinking&#x02014;or died of <foreign>ennui</foreign> and flea-bites&#x02014;but my escape was effected just in time to spare the world the cruel shock of such untimely loss of one of its brightest ornaments. And surely my husband will never tempt Providence in so daring a manner again! Since we have been here, the scales one would say, have fallen from his eyes, and he has awaked to some sense of the quiet and comfort of No. 5 Cheyne Row in comparison with all the other places he has tried and found wanting&#x02014;&#x0201C;it must be <pb id="pg-13-274" n="13:274"/>confessed his bedroom here <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the very freest from noise he ever slept in&#x0201D;&#x02014;and several other things have been to be &#x0201C;confessed,&#x0201D; which hitherto he has most sceptically denied. And so we are not to <hi rend="italic">flit</hi> as he threatened me with next Lady-day<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1842-03-25">25 March</date>.</note>&#x02014;at least I infer so not only from these verbal concessions, but from the still more conclusive fact, that he is investing a small amount of capital in new carpets for the stairs and library, which were an imprudent outlay if he had still thought of leaving in six months&#x02014;and imprudence in spending is a thing which not man&#x02014;or woman&#x02014;can lay to his charge. You cannot imagine what an amelioration of my earthly lot it were to be delivered, tho&#x02019; only for <hi rend="italic">one</hi> year, from his hitherto unceasing speculations about &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">flying</hi> presently,&#x0201D; he knows not whither; but to some &#x0201C;remote region,&#x0201D; or &#x0201C;solitary shore of the sea,&#x0201D; or even &#x0201C;solitary island in the sea&#x0201D;&#x02014;where, the beauty of it is, in six months&#x02019; time he would be ready to cut his throat. With some people the difficulty of realising their desires is small, compared with the difficulty of ascertaining for themselves what their real desires are. And my husband belongs to this perplexing and perplexed section of humanity. &#x02026;</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Sir</hi>&#x02014;</salute> The book you have honoured me by sending, and the letter along with it, arrived here two days ago. Allow me to return many kind thanks for this attention. I am glad and proud to be remembered by one who is always memorable to me, and memorable to all the world, whether they have seen or have not seen him.</p>
<p>A wholesome, grateful air of hope, brotherly kindness, cheerful sagacity, salutes me from this book as I eagerly glance over it: to read it with care, as I purpose shortly to do, will be no task for me, but a pleasure. One is sure beforehand of finding much, very much, that one must at once and zealously assent to; and slower assent, doubt, examination,&#x02014;nay, ultimate dissent itself, (turning only on the application and details), can but render a beautiful deeper basis of agreement more visible. It seems to me a great truth this fundamental principle of yours, which I trace as the origin of all these hopes, endeavours, and <pb id="pg-13-275" n="13:275"/>convictions in regard to Pauperism, that human things cannot stand on selfishness, mechanical utilities, economics, and law-courts; that if there be not a religious element in the relations of men, such relations are miserable and doomed to ruin. A poor-law can be no lasting remedy; the poor and the rich, when once the naked parts of their condition come into collision, cannot long live together upon a poor-law! Solely as a sad transitionary palliative against still fiercer miseries and insupportabilities can it pretend to recommend itself, till something better be vouchsafed us, with <hi rend="italic">true</hi> healing under its wings!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the book, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411009-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1841-10-09">9 Oct.</date></ref> In his letter of <date when="1841-09-29">29 Sept.</date>, Chalmers had said: &#x0201C;My chief anxiety is for the insertion of a permissive clause in the New Poor-Law Bill which might empower Parishes to commence the retracting process to a better order of things without being fettered by the general provisions of the Bill. Could I obtain the concurrence of yourself and other literary and influential men of London in this view, it might go far.&#x0201D; Dr. William Pulteney Alison (<date when="1790">1790</date>&#x02013;<date when="1859">1859</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/350"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) had provoked Chalmers&#x02019;s lectures, on which his book was based, by attacking the Scottish system of parochial relief in <hi rend="italic">Observations on the Management of the Poor in Scotland</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1840">1840</date>). Chalmers failed in his campaign for a return to the system of voluntary benevolence, as a commission of inquiry, <date when="1844">1844</date>, led to an act embodying Alison&#x02019;s suggestion for legal provision by assessment for poor relief, <date when="1845">1845</date>.</note></p>
<p>Alas! the poor of this country seem to me, in these years, to be fast becoming the miserablest of all sorts of men. Black slaves in South Carolina, I do believe, deserve pity enough; but the Black is at least not stranded, cast ashore, from the stream of human interests, and left to perish there: he is connected with human interests, <hi rend="italic">belongs</hi> to those above him, if only as a slave. Blacks, too, I suppose, are cased in a beneficent wrappage of stupidity and insensibility: one pallid Paisley weaver, with the sight of his famishing children round him, with the memory of his decent independent father before him, has probably more wretchedness in his single heart than a hundred Blacks.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes noted that TC said, probably in <date when="1840">1840</date>, that &#x0201C;there is more misery in one starving Lancashire weaver than in a population of negro slaves&#x0201D; (MS: Trinity College, Cambridge 216).</note> Did you observe the late trial at Stockport, in Cheshire, of a human father and human mother, for poisoning three of their children to gain successively some &#xa3;3,8s. from a Burial Society for each of them!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann and Robert Sandys had been accused of murdering their children, <date when="1840-11">Nov. 1840</date>. At the trial in <date when="1841-08">Aug.</date> only Robert Sandys was found guilty of one of the murders; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401118-TC-AC-01"><!-- 12:329 -->TC to AC, <date when="1840-11-18">18 Nov. 1840</date></ref>.</note> A barrister of my acquaintance, who goes that circuit, informs me positively that the official people durst not go farther into this business; that this case was by no means a solitary one there; that, on the whole, they thought it good to close up the matter swiftly again from the light of day, and investigate it no deeper. &#x02018;The hands of the pitiful women have sodden <pb id="pg-13-276" n="13:276"/>their own children!&#x02019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lam. 4:10.</note> Such a state of matters cannot subsist under the firmament of Heaven: such a state of matters will remedy itself, as God lives&#x02014;remedy itself, if not by mild means, then by fierce and fiercest!</p>
<p>That you, with your generous hopeful heart, believe there may still exist in our actual Churches enough of divine fire to awaken the supine rich and the degraded poor, and act victoriously against such a mass of pressing and ever-accumulating evils&#x02014;alas! what worse could be said of this by the bitterest opponent of it, than that it is a noble hoping against hope, a noble strenuous determination to gather from the dry deciduous tree what the green alone could yield? Surely, for those that have still such a faith, I will vote that they should have all possible room to try it in. With a Chalmers in every British parish, much might be possible! But, alas! what assurance is there that in any one British parish there will ever be another?</p>
<p>But enough of this. Go as it may, your labours in this matter are not lost&#x02014;no jot of them is lost. Nay, in one shape or another, as I believe, the thing that you advocate must verily realize itself in this earth&#x02014;across what famines, poor-laws, convulsions, and embroiled strugglings is not known to man. My prayer is, that a voice so humane, so true and wise, may long be heard in this debate, and attentively laid to heart on all sides.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>If I am good for nothing else today, I may at least send you a little news of myself! I awoke in the night-time, and <hi rend="italic">have slept till almost noon;</hi> besides they are putting new carpets on my room, and I am banished into a back closet: in short there is little prospect of my doing much work for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> morning at any rate.</p>
<p>We have been living as quietly as possible here, and are doing tolerably well in all ways. Jane begins to dislike the approaches of winter; the mornings and evenings already have a very frosty breath, and <pb id="pg-13-277" n="13:277"/>our weather keeps continually damp: however, she does not complain specially, and indeed is very busy, getting all manner of improvements made in my <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> apartment,&#x02014;so that I may be able to do something useful and notable thro&#x02019; the winter! Alas, I am dreadfully <foreign><hi rend="italic">spavined</hi></foreign> in that department; <hi rend="italic">&#x0201C;stiff to ye reise, Sandy, man&#x0201D;:</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400723-TC-AC-01"><sic>12:204</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1840-07-23">23 July 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> it will be a good while before I get fairly under way yet. Otherwise I have nothing to complain of. I must just struggle on till I do get into heat, and the <hi rend="italic">stiffness</hi> leave me somewhat. I have had a long rest now; and I was not sent hither to rest.</p>
<p>If Jenny have gone to the Gill, or whether she have gone or not, I wish she would write me a short line. Did they ever actually introduce that <foreign><hi rend="italic">chauffer</hi></foreign> with the coke-cinders? The rooms will be terribly damp otherwise. And with regard to the chauffer itself, Jenny must take very particular care never to have it burning without a bit of the window open,&#x02014;at least never to go near it without first opening the window: the air of it will choke one, if not freely mixed with atmosphere air; and is dangerous for children. But she is a <foreign><hi rend="italic">feat</hi></foreign> [clever] methodic little body; I hope she will get herself adjusted in some tolerable way in spite of all.</p>
<p>Jack has sent me two Letters, the last of them on Saturday; I enclose you both: there was a Newspaper yesterday. The Brighton people have had an accident on their railway; which perhaps will make them more careful, and their conveyance safer, for the time coming.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; Poor Fraser&#x02019;s business is to be carried on, but we do not yet know by whom: my accounts are to be furnished me &#x0201C;as soon as possible&#x0201D;; I hope there will be something in them when they come!</p>
<p>Jean lately sent me a <foreign><hi rend="italic">braw</hi></foreign> Glengarry Cap, of a grey colour, from Dumfries: will you therefore apprise Alick that he need not send me the one I talked of;&#x02014;unless indeed he have already got it, in which case I will not let it go to waste. I wish Jamie would tell me how his harvest is coming on: he must have had an awful fight, if your weather was like ours. We have hardly had two entirely dry days.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wet weather had led to a bad harvest in Scotland and England.</note> It threatens to be a very miserable winter this for innumerable poor people. Some think that Peel really expects a degree of uproar and mobbing among the cotton-people; that he will then turn round to his Corn-Law friends, and say, &#x0201C;See! we must give way, or they will burn us and kill us.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>Dr Chalmers, a few days ago, sent me a new Book of his, on Poor Laws; on the possibility of still doing without a Poor-Law in Scotland: he wishes, he says, to gain my vote for that side of the question. I answered his civility very civilly; but can by no means be of his opinion <pb id="pg-13-278" n="13:278"/>there.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Chalmers believed in the voluntary principle for poor relief, but TC was aware of the need for a poor rate of some kind; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381229-TC-AC-01"><sic>10:255</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1838-12-29">29 Dec. 1838</date></corr></ref> and <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411011-TC-TCH-01">TC to <sic>TCh</sic><corr>TCH</corr>, <date when="1841-10-11">11 Oct.</date></ref></note> The <hi rend="italic">Manchester Times</hi> Editor takes a much notabler step: he prints at great length my account of the riots and burnings at the beginning of the French Revolution, and calls it &#x0201C;Supplement extraordinary to the <hi rend="italic">Plea for the Poor!</hi>&#x0201D; Perhaps you might notice it in the Newspaper I sent you: it is now reprinted as a little pamphlet, and circulating up and down by post. It is indeed a Supplement <hi rend="italic">extraordinary:</hi> it would not be amiss if all manner of Serene Highnesses took note of it. A hungry belly has no ears; and against mad oppression mad revolt has been appointed as a remedy.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, when are you going to indite me a little &#x0201C;scrape of a pen,&#x0201D; up in your little room, now that perhaps you are again alone up there? I want always to know whatsoever goes on. The little black &#x0201C;witch&#x0201D; teapot, how often do I see it in my mind, when sumptuous silver services and all manner of grand apparatuses are at work before my eyes!&#x02014;</p>
<p>I sometimes think it would be as well if I wrote seldomer,&#x02014;and waited till there was something to say! But you are glad to hear of me, even when I say nothing&#x02014; If Jenny be not gone, perhaps she will not be in such a hurry now, till the plaster dry a little.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Farewell, dear Mother, for this day: it rains, rains; I must <hi rend="italic">try</hi> whether there be no work possible for me. I send my brotherly affection to one and all. Good be ever <supplied>[with]</supplied> you all!&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have read your blockhead M&#x02019;Gregor&#x02019;s Dissertation on <hi rend="italic">Ossian,</hi> his Appendixes &#x00026;c; and cannot say that he seems to have thrown any light whatever, worth noting, upon any subject under the sun. His &#x0201C;Highland Society&#x0201D; is the Highland Society <hi rend="italic">of London,</hi>&#x02014;an august body whom I have hardly ever heard of till now.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Patrick MacGregor, <hi rend="italic">The Genuine Remains of Ossian. Literally Translated: with a Preliminary Dissertation</hi> (<date when="1841">1841</date>), pbd. under the patronage of the Highland Society of London, founded <date when="1778">1778</date>. TC was familiar with the Highland Society of Scotland, founded <date when="1784">1784</date> in Edinburgh, whose <hi rend="italic">Report of the Committee of the Highland Society of Scotland, Appointed to Inquire into the Nature and Authenticity of the Poems of Ossian</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1805">1805</date>), was drawn up by Henry Mackenzie. This concluded that no one epic poem existed and that James Macpherson (<date when="1736">1736</date>&#x02013;<date when="1796">96</date>; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190714-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:191</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1819-07-14">14 July 1819</date></corr></ref>) had trans. and ed. traditional Scottish Gaelic poetry and inserted passages of his own, conclusions confirmed by Derrick S. Thomson, <hi rend="italic">The Gaelic Sources of Macpherson&#x02019;s Ossian</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1952">1952</date>).</note> He is one of those Celtic <pb id="pg-13-279" n="13:279"/>blockheads, against whose nationalities, as Pinkerton says, argument has and can have no effect; who are <hi rend="italic">past</hi> logic:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Pinkerton (<date when="1758">1758</date>&#x02013;<date when="1826">1826</date>), Scottish antiquary and historian. TC presumably refers to Pinkerton&#x02019;s description of &#x0201C;a Celtic understanding, which always judges by the inverse ratio of reason&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">A Dissertation on the Origin and Progress of the Scythians or Goths</hi> [<date when="1787">1787</date>] 67n). TC shared Pinkerton&#x02019;s feeling of racial superiority to the Celts; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410719-TC-RMM-01">TC to RMM, <date when="1841-07-19">19 July</date></ref>.</note> let us leave him alone in his glory then.</p>
<p>The only article, it seems to me, worth writing on Ossian at present were perhaps some genetic history of the Chimera of Ossian, <hi rend="italic">treated</hi> as a Chimera; some sketch of the quack-career of James Macpherson (rather a curious man), and of the curious reception he met with from pretentious Noodledom in that time; a delineation which might illustrate several things. But ample elbowroom would be indispensable for such an article; nor do I know that sufficient materials exist for it, even on research,&#x02014;nor that they would be worth seeking for if they did.</p>
<p>Not long ago I had a transient notion of something about <hi rend="italic">Baillie&#x02019;s Letters and Journals;</hi> that is to say, about Scotch Covenanterism, the Edinburgh gatherings in <date when="1637">1637</date>, Strafford&#x02019;s Trial, Montrose &#x00026;c: but it remained only as a vague, not very manageable cloud, in my head; I do not yet know whether manageable on any terms; and certainly as a short Article nothing could be made of it.</p>
<p>On the whole, I fear much there is nothing to be got of me that will suit you at present. My hand is entirely out, in the &#x0201C;article&#x0201D; department; and indeed, as matters stand, perhaps it is fully as well so.</p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>In writing to my Mother the other day, I forgot, what was an essential part of my message, to make mention of our situation as to meal and butter!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><ref target="volume-13/lt-18411012-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1841-10-12">12 Oct.</date></ref>; for the arrival of butter, meal, cheese, and bacon at Chelsea, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411110-JWC-IC-01">JWC to <sic>ICC</sic><corr>IC</corr>, [<date when="1841-11-10">10 Nov.</date>?]</ref>.</note> I must now send you a separate word about it.</p>
<p>Our meal, which is found to make very respectable porridge when well boiled, will hold out, it seems, some fourteen or fifteen days from this date. Pickford&#x02019;s Canal conveyance never yet was known to take less than about 9 days from Liverpool. You see therefore there is no time to be lost! However we will not have you overhaste yourself, or us; we will wait rather for another week than have meal that the Miller of Satur and you do not entirely approve of. The quantity we had last time, which perhaps you remember better than I, was the right quantity. So of the Butter: it was all right last year; Isabella has only to do the same over again, and everything will suit.</p>
<p>If Alick could conveniently get the four pounds of that Tobacco from Ewart&#x02019;s Carlisle man (I forget the name of him,&#x02014;Alison? or what?),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Allison &#x00026; Son, 1 English St., Carlisle.</note> it would be of service here; it could come, not too tightly wrapt up, yet sufficiently covered from the meal; and in the cold weather it would not be apt to spoil. I have ordered three pounds from the Tobacconist here; but it is very inferior. If Alick ever <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> the Carlisle man, he could perhaps make some arrangement with him as to sending me, at any time, direct thro&#x02019; Newcastle a four-pound packet: if it could arrive here at the rate of 4 shillings a lb., and be as good as Ewart sells it, I should find it generally an accommodation worth the trouble to me.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; But Alick need not enter upon all that, nor indeed trouble himself with the Weed at all, unless the business happen to be convenient <hi rend="italic">at present;</hi> we would not have the meal delayed a day on account of it. This is all.</p>
<p>We do not hear a word of your practical history in these weeks; nothing authentic even about the weather can I glean anywhere; M&#x02019;Diarmid whom I consult weekly is as vague as the wind. I can only consider that in all probability you have an &#x0201C;awfu&#x02019; struggle,&#x0201D; as poor old Cowthwaite<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340706-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:236</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-07-06">6 July 1834</date></corr></ref>. Cowthwaite had been a carrier.</note> used to have, and that with your old patient energy you <pb id="pg-13-281" n="13:281"/>are working thro&#x02019; it, better or worse. A written word on the subject by and by will be very welcome.</p>
<p>Neither do I hear whether Jenny has yet gone to the Gill: I hope the rooms are dried a little there now;&#x02014;and also that all persons will take care of choking themselves, if the charcoal still go on!&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; We are struggling along here, in fair health; I still very <hi rend="italic">stupid,</hi> unable handsomely to get to any work. I must and will prosper, by and by. My Mother ought not to venture out in these damp raw-frosty evenings Make my compliments to little Tom, and upwards from him to the whole house. <closer><salute>Good be ever with you all!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter from some of your Lady Correspondents, which has just arrived, along with the one from yourself for me. Alick&#x02019;s too came at the same time.</p>
<p>Your plan of subscribing to the Library seems to me altogether a proper one: for &#xa3;26 paid at once you have good reading for the rest of your days. Or if you choose to do it <hi rend="italic">annually,</hi> there is a break left for persons going out of the country; a man going out of the country can discontinue, and begin again.&#x02014; For the rest, you need not wait till you <hi rend="italic">come</hi> up. Employ me, if you like that, and I will subscribe at once, and send you off 15 volumes. A catalogue, I understand, will be out very soon.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The catalogue of the London Library was drawn up, <date when="1841">1841</date>, and pbd., <date when="1842">1842</date>.</note> Is there no Book or set of Books I could get for you, straightway, otherwise, and send it?</p>
<p>We have wretched weather for most part; this morning a drop-dropping about my bed was the first sound I heard: water, as yet in small quantity, coming in! Perry&#x02019;s men have been all forenoon on the roof,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably those employed by John Perry, builder, 29 Lawrence St., Chelsea.</note> and declare it sound now. Our &#x0201C;Library&#x0201D; is all beautifully fitted up for me, at last: curtains, window-blinds, new carpet;&#x02014;fit for doing some literary feat in! I sit daily in it, <hi rend="italic">au secret</hi> [in secret]: but nothing comes of me yet. Hickson, poor slut, most pathetically requests an &#x0201C;article.&#x0201D; I am not sure but I may give him one, to bring in my hand. Better <pb id="pg-13-282" n="13:282"/>write anything than not write at all. I must and will write something!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Gordon went away on Thursday.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Gordon.</note> We did not see him after Saturday night. He was dreadfully prosaic, computing the incomes of people &#x00026;c; but affectionate, wholesome, seemingly happy: Good be with poor Gordon. John Sterling is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> coming now. The old Stimabile is off &#x0201C;to Dorsetshire&#x0201D;; I have never yet seen him: he came, the day before setting out; in few minutes, succeeded in quarrelling with Jane too, and flung off, his skin <hi rend="italic">hotter</hi> than ever!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201C;Cooling in the skin that he grew hot in&#x0201D;; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411009-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1841-10-09">9 Oct.</date></ref></note> The unfortunate Stimabile. Mrs S. laughs, and says, He is a fool, you know. By a Letter we had from Jeffrey, he seems to have been in a very dangerous fever (at Haylebury, his Son-in-law&#x02019;s), and to be still as weak as possible, tho&#x02019; recovering.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey had written from William Empson&#x02019;s at Haileybury, <date when="1841-10-12">12 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;The worst accounts you had of me, were nearest the truth:&#x02014;for 5 weeks I have scarcely been out of bed&#x02014;and the fever is at last gone, and the cough too. &#x02026; For some days I was as near dead as <hi rend="italic">possible</hi>&#x02014;and am less than half alive, even now. &#x02026; With truest and kindest love to my dear Jane and my cordial regards to yourself.&#x0201D;</note> John Mill is vigorously getting ready a &#x0201C;Book on Logic&#x0201D;:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410321-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1841-03-21">21 March</date></ref>.</note> we never see him here. Indeed we see almost nobody here, as yet; we are as quiet as mortals can well be: the far profitablest fashion for some of us. I read every night and <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to write every morning. Courage!</p>
<p>Nothing, I think, has yet been decided about poor Fraser&#x02019;s &#x0201C;business&#x0201D;: Nickisson told me it had been offered to him for a sum of money; somebody would take it for a sum; meanwhile my &#x0201C;accounts&#x0201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George William Nickisson, publisher and ed. of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x02019;s Magazine,</hi> <date when="1842">1842</date>&#x02013;<date when="1847">47</date>.</note> would be got ready for me soon.&#x02014; My time is quite done: I have other Letters to write; my <hi rend="italic">trial</hi> to write has been again futile. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Jack:</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your good little Letter; which was very welcome here. I had one from John the same day; I sent yours on to him, for we had yet neither of us got any word; I have this morning had a second line from the Doctor: both these, as an apology for this scrap of my own, I will now inclose to you. There has a Letter also just come from Jean <pb id="pg-13-283" n="13:283"/>at Dumfries, reporting all well; and yesterday I had a very short note from Jenny herself, whom my Mother and Jamie had that same day been over to see. Nothing, it seems, is far wrong among you; for which I am very thankful.</p>
<p>Jamie&#x02019;s harvest must be a heavy handful to him at present; I wish he were handsomely thro&#x02019; it, poor fellow! Today and yesterday the wind is brisk from the North, and I have got a fire lighted here: there was wet, however, in the night; and it continues still the worst weather I have ever seen <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.&#x02014; Wheat, it seems, after all the &#x02018;grand harvest&#x02019; reported in the Newspapers, is &#x02018;threshing very <hi rend="italic">light&#x02019;:</hi> no doubt of it; how can wheat prove &#x02018;heavy&#x02019;! It is a dismal-looking season for innumerable poor people in our Country, this that we are now entering on.</p>
<p>We find by a Letter lately that poor Lord Jeffrey has been dangerously ill, and still continues very weak; not likely to be in order again, I conjecture, all winter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411016-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1841-10-16">16 Oct.</date></ref></note> He is in this Country, with his Daughter and Son-in-law; some twenty miles north of London.</p>
<p>I wrote something to Jamie about Alison&#x02019;s Carlisle Tobacco.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411015-TC-JC-01">TC to JC, <date when="1841-10-15">15 Oct.</date></ref></note> Do not mind it; it will but confuse you,&#x02014;unless there be a clear opportunity. In which case truly I suppose the real man to apply to were not Alison but the Whitehaven Tobacconist: his Tobacco as I used to get it fresh from you was better than Ewart&#x02019;s,&#x02014;stronger and as genuine.</p> 
<p>We are well enough; I still struggling to get ground broken in my work,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster MS, f.170r. is headed &#x0201C;<hi rend="small-caps">oliver</hi> still!&#x02014;<date when="1841-10-19">19 Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, 1841</date>&#x02014;&#x0201D; and makes some interesting comments on biography, including the dismissal of them, &#x0201C;<foreign>Ay de mi!</foreign> (Yes, indeed!) (Was ever greater nonsense).&#x0201D; They are another indication that he was concerned with the problems of writing history and biography in a way that his earlier essays on the subject had hardly touched on.</note>&#x02014;or as Tom Garthwaite when <hi rend="italic">lame,</hi> &#x02018;to <hi rend="italic">work out</hi> the <foreign><hi rend="italic">streen</hi></foreign> [strain],<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> and get along like a real worker!</p>
<p>May all go well with you, my dear Brother, for this world and for the next! Ah me!&#x02014; But there is not another scrap of room or time.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir</salute>
<p>That letter from you &#x0201C;all to myself,&#x0201D; as the children say, made me both proud and glad. My romantic journey with you thro&#x02019; beautiful dream-like places,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the Highlands. In his letter to TC, <date when="1841-09-29">29 Sept.</date>, Chalmers had hoped that &#x0201C;I have still a place in the recollection of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle, whose acquaintance I first made on the waters of Loch-Lomond in <date when="1821">1821</date>.&#x0201D;</note> seen then for the first time, and the last, with poor Edward Irving following desperately in our track, your and your wife&#x02019;s kindness<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grace Chalmers, b. Pratt (<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x02013;<date when="1850">1850</date>), m. <date when="1812">1812</date>, well known for her kindness.</note> to the audacious stranger-girl,&#x02014;all <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was not likely ever to die out of my recollection: but in reading, here, at Chelsea, kind words to me under your own hand; it seemed as if I were still hearing your voice in <hi rend="italic">the improvised cart,</hi> amidst <foreign>lochs</foreign> and hills, or in the steamboat on the Clyde! I have <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> you, however, more recently than you think&#x02014;both seen and heard you, while I was the last person you were dreaming of&#x02014; Some years ago, when you preached in the Swallow-Street-Chapel I was sitting there looking wistfully in your face, and feeling, at the <hi rend="italic">rousing</hi> you were giving the people, almost as if I had a hand in it!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Swallow St. Scotch Chapel, off Piccadilly; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370803-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:273&#x02013;74</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1837-08-03">3 Aug. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> It was the Preacher of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> country, the Apostle of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> youth, whom they were there listening to in breathless attention; and I felt as if I had a part and lot in you which <hi rend="italic">they</hi> had not&#x02014;I took such a long look at you in coming away that I think you must have felt some emotion <hi rend="italic">at your heart</hi> without knowing what could be the cause of it! But I was no longer the head-long young Lady that used to start away at a tangent and catch people by the skirts in the open street; &#x0201C;actually believing&#x0201D; as my sarcastic uncle used to tell me &#x0201C;that every body was as pleased to see me, as I to see every body&#x0201D;! I could still have found in <hi rend="italic">my heart</hi> to run after you, and catch you by the skirt, and take my chance! but my <hi rend="italic">head</hi> protested against a procedure so startling, so affronting to all the <foreign><hi rend="italic">convenances</hi></foreign> [propriety] of this world. I feared to importune you&#x02014;to make a fool of myself&#x02014;and so&#x02014;let you go&#x02014;with a sigh!&#x02014; Next time that you come to London, you will perhaps be kind <pb id="pg-13-285" n="13:285"/>enough to tell me how you may be arrived at in a way more suitable to my years, and grave manners; or perhaps you will find your road to Chelsea, if it were only to give yourself the benevolent pleasure of seeing how improved I am&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">in common decency</hi>&#x02014;whether or no in anything else; I never feel perfectly sure! Meanwhile I will read your Mrs Marshalls books<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Hermiston Marshall of Manchester had sent Chalmers some of her &#x0201C;little tracts&#x0201D; in <date when="1841-09">Sept.</date> and had been invited by Chalmers to visit him in Burntisland. Not further identified.</note>&#x02014;very thankful to have them recommended to me by <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> just at a crisis in my history when I was feeling &#x0201C;rather exquisitely&#x0201D; that the generality of books do not &#x0201C;touch upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> crime,&#x0201D; as the strangler Burke neatly phrased it.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Burke (<date when="1729">1729</date>&#x02013;<date when="1829">1829</date>), Edinburgh body-snatcher and murderer; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18290113-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:7</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1829-01-13">13 Jan. 1829</date></corr></ref>.</note> I do not disclaim the opportunities of making them more known which you attribute to my position, as my position is not of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> making&#x02014;and in all modesty I may own to its <hi rend="italic">publicity</hi>.</p>
<p>My dear Mother, thank God is still spared to me, and enjoying tolerable health. I spent a month in Dumfriesshire with her this summer&#x02014;after a separation of two years. I often think, because perhaps, having no children of my own, I am interested in finding reasons for not regretting it&#x02014;how little good poor Mothers get of their married daughters, whom they have had such a world of plague in bearing, and nursing up, and training, and teaching, until they could shift for themselves! She will be heartily gratified by your remembrance of her, which I forwarded in my last letter.</p>
<p>My husband is upstairs with his inkstand and books&#x02014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">au secret</hi></foreign>&#x02014;in so very strict a sense that even <hi rend="italic">I</hi> dare not intrude upon him to tell him that I am writing to you&#x02014;otherwise doubtless he would send some answer to your message, which I can answer for it he <hi rend="italic">looked</hi> gratified in receiving&#x02014;</p>
<p>Be kind enough to remember me <hi rend="italic">affectionately</hi> to Mrs Chalmers, on my own account, and also on poor Edward Irving&#x02019;s who always talked of her to me with grateful affection. Alas! what traces of himself has that noble spirit left on this earth!&#x02014;a few shrieking bewildered men collecting the rabble&#x02014;and the <hi rend="italic">police</hi>&#x02014;at street corners! But surely <hi rend="italic">that</hi> cannot be all! &#x0201C;throw thy bread on the waters and thou shalt find it after many days.&#x0201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccles. 11:1.</note> He threw his bread on the waters and&#x02014;his life-blood after it&#x02014;shall it not be made good to him even here?&#x02014;</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I had better write you a few words today than none at all; a few words will tell you that we are all well, which will still be worth something. My morning&#x02019;s work, or rather I should say <hi rend="italic">attempt</hi> to work, is done; I will send you my salutation before running out to have my walk.</p>
<p>Jenny sent me a small Letter from Gill, poor little Jenny; in which she mentions that you and Jamie were over there that day, and that you in particular seemed to be improving from your former state of health. I can well believe you have much more composure now; and we all hope you will rapidly get back to your old condition at least; and that this new arrangement will suit better for everybody. Jenny&#x02019;s poor little Letter affects me with great sympathy; I will surely write to her soon. Will Jamie tell me: Has she any <hi rend="italic">ready money</hi> in her pocket, and how much? I want to know that.&#x02014; There came a Letter also from Jean, enclosing one from Isabella to her; the tidings of which were to the same purport.</p>
<p>We have got our upper room made very smart and comfortable here: I have the sole possession of it till 2 or 3 o&#x02019;clock; then in the evenings Jane too moves up stairs, for it is warm, roomy, by far our best winter room, indeed the only good <hi rend="italic">winter</hi> room we have. The room down below is not habitable in winter, except divided into two, with the &#x0201C;folding-doors&#x0201D; of it all sealed up and papered; at least I never like to inhabit it.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014;  Our weather is occasionally dry and cold; but for most part, rainy, rainy! I wonder what Jamie and the latter &#x0201C;half of his crop&#x0201D; are doing.</p>
<p>As to myself and my work, there is yet nothing whatever of a definite nature to be said. I am trying this and trying that, all round the workshop: I only know that <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi> is naturally agreeable, to me as to all animals and men,&#x02014;yet naturally desperately <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>agreeable too; and that I must and will get myself to work! I think of some small short thing first, till once my hand come in again. You will surely get better news of me before long.</p>
<p>On Thursday evening last, in the dusk before tea, a knock was heard; and the Doctor from Brighton walked up stairs. He had come in with his Patient and the Aunt<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Ogilby and Mary Scott.</note> and others of them: he was well, cheerful; and all was as well as usual in their establishment. He did <pb id="pg-13-287" n="13:287"/>not know but they would go back on the morrow. However I still found him last night in their H&#xF4;tel; Miss Scott (he said), the Patient&#x02019;s Aunt, was a little unwell; so that perhaps, I suppose, they will not go now till monday,&#x02014;especially as today the weather proves bad. They know not yet when they are to return to London for good; &#x0201C;their house at Brighton is taken <hi rend="italic">for one other week&#x0201D;:</hi> I fancy they will not stay very long at Brighton now.</p>
<p>Alas, dear Mother, there is <hi rend="italic">three</hi> o&#x02019;clock striking; I must run, and snatch myself a walk! I have said nothing at all today;&#x02014;alas, I would like to say so many things. But the thoughts of men are often <hi rend="italic">voiceless,</hi> and cannot be said. Ah, how many thoughts do you send to me, and I to you, of which there is nothing at all said! I will try to have another short word for you ready about Sunday next, when you come to the preaching. One word will be worth something. I am terribly tattered about at present,&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">till I get to work</hi>. <closer><salute>Farewell, dear Mother; may God be with you all, and bless you always!</salute></closer></p>

<p>beginning yet. How they are to get thro&#x02019; the winter might seem a mystery to us. I think there is considerable danger of disturbance and riot in the large towns.</p>
<p>Our last news from Scotsbrig was by a Letter from Jean; who I think meant to return by Gill, and you, after writing that Letter. Your news therefore are later than ours.</p>
<p>I asked them to tell me at present what money you had in hand; but they have not done it yet. Jamie (of Scotsbrig) said formerly he thought there were upwards of fifty pounds worth of things belonging to you in his hands; and that he would furnish you with what part of the payment of it you gradually needed. That seemed to me a reasonable plan. Meanwhile not knowing how things actually go on, and whether you have got fairly started yet, I imagine it may be as satisfactory to me if I send you a Five-pound Note herewith;&#x02014;as I accordingly do. If you have no need of it, lay it by till you have. I could like at any rate to hear that you had <hi rend="italic">plenty of good firing</hi> for those rooms <pb id="pg-13-288" n="13:288"/>of yours in winter; and I wish you to get yourself two carts of coals out of this money: James will bring them for you from Annan; or if he is too busy an Annan Carter will do it.</p>
<p>Write me a single word by return of post to say that this Letter has arrived safe. I enclose you a cover, which is already stamped (it came here by mistake in that state), and needs only to be sealed.&#x02014; Write to me more at large afterwards; write to me always, dear Jenny, when you are in difficulty, when I can do any service whatever for you. <closer><salute>And so Good be with you!&#x02014; Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Could you conveniently send me that Address <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have lately emitted in the name of Leeds Reform Association. An extract of it appeared in the last <hi rend="italic">Examiner;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> <date when="1841-10-23">23 Oct.</date>, gave excerpts from J. G. Marshall&#x02019;s address to the Leeds Parliamentary Reform Association. He referred to the &#x0201C;corn-law aristocracy. &#x02026; They, the wealthiest, most powerful, and splendid aristocracy in the world, and who are indebted for by far the largest portion of those advantages to the labour of yourselves, their industrious fellow-countrymen, the inhabitants of populous cities, the moving forces of the workshops, the ships, commerce, and colonies of England.&#x0201D;</note> and I want to see the whole.&#x02014; It seems also your long-eared noisy Dr Holland is still going on with his <hi rend="italic">Millocrat;</hi> his brayings too, with your original <hi rend="italic">Letter to Fitzwilliam,</hi> which provoked the same,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles William Wentworth (<date when="1786">1786</date>&#x02013;<date when="1857">1857</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9653"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 3d Earl Fitzwilliam, friend of the Marshall family, opponent of the Corn Laws and previously an advocate of parliamentary reform; he had refused an invitation from the Leeds Parliamentary Reform Association, of which Marshall was pres., because he did not believe there was &#x0201C;any great discrepancy between the opinions of the people and those of Parliament,&#x0201D; and could see no reason for further reform (<hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1841-01-29">29 Jan.</date>). Marshall&#x02019;s reply, <date when="1841-02-05">5 Feb.</date>, on the state of the manufacturing classes, was rptd. in full from the <hi rend="italic">Leeds Times</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1841-02-12">12 Feb.</date> George Calvert Holland (<date when="1801">1801</date>&#x02013;<date when="1865">65</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13519"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), physician, previously a liberal, now a supporter of the Corn Laws, and a banking and railway director. <hi rend="italic">The Millocrat, a Series of Letters to J. G. Marshall, Esq., of Leeds</hi> (<date when="1841">1841</date>).</note> I could like to have in full: but this, as far too post-heavy in proportion to my impatience, may wait for an opportunity.</p>
<p>We are well here; I have hopes of beginning to get to some work <pb id="pg-13-289" n="13:289"/>again,&#x02014;thank Heaven! I wrote, twice I think, to your Brother Henry<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Cowper Marshall.</note> from Tynemouth, about meeting him at Leeds in our passage hither: alas, on arriving at York, we found that the route did not go by Leeds at all; that it would be better to plunge right onward, without stopping at all. Pray state this to him, with my compliments, with my regrets.</p>
<p>It begins to appear to me, in these days, that perhaps there ought to be a right Radical <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> set on foot, and that I should undertake the editing of it! The poor existing <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review,</hi> lies now, I believe, in the last stage of abject languor and despicability,&#x02014;must go out, one would prophesy, before long, like an expiring wick among rancid fish oils; a miserable end! Molesworth laid out on the business several thousand pounds; which he might as well, except for his own good intentions, have flung over Westminster Bridge.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir William Molesworth (<date when="1810">1810</date>&#x02013;<date when="1855">55</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18902"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), politician, though not an M.P., <date when="1841">1841</date>&#x02013;<date when="1845">45</date>.

His proprietorship ended, <date when="1838-04">April 1838</date>. TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1841-12-13">13 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;I have lately had thoughts that I should have a Review of my own; that the West<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, perishing in the present hands, ought to be my Review! A rash thought.&#x0201D;</note> In fact the thing seems to me a kind of emblem of the poor hidebound Benthamee Radicalism it set about representing. That too lies dyinging;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> cast out miserably into the ditch, never in all Eternity to live more. Black, Atheistic, unsympathizing Radicalism is ended; a new nobler sort seems to me on all hands struggling to begin. Perhaps, for the sake of England, it really ought to be preached abroad with all the heart and energy that is to be found alive in England? Your only Church and Pulpit, in these times, is a Periodical Book. To set such a Pulpit handsomely up, much is wanted, how much! Cash, first of all;&#x02014;no not <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of all: Faith and Insight, first of all.&#x02014; I do occasionally think of these things, afar off or near at hand: I invite you to turn them over also.

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>The news that you had got out of bed again was of all others the welcomest here. You are very kind to think of us in your sickness; to see us beautified thro&#x02019; that pale moonlight medium, and to love us as you with your kind heart do! We heard from your Mother that there was &#x0201C;blistering&#x0201D; afoot again. Happily it is now over for this time: my practical &#x0201C;use of terror&#x0201D; from it (as the Puritan Preachers say) would be, Take double and treble care of yourself in future. That you should be hunted out of Falmouth too by that scamp of a &#x0201C;Nosology&#x0201D; (a dangerous fellow for us all) were too bad. I bid you work slow, and dress warm.</p>
<p>The lithograph cockadoodle is not here now,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410927-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1841-09-27">27 Sept.</date></ref></note> did not stay here above a day; packing up a mass of abominable scarecrow effigies of Oxford Puseyites for Thomas Spedding, I found the Lithograph still lying on my table, and put it in by way of salt, to give a kind of savour to the mass, and perhaps keep off putrescence. So Spedding has it,&#x02014;and who knows accordingly but future ages will have it! A man must look to that when he lithographs. Prince Posterity is always on the watch withal, if anything be going!&#x02014;</p>
<p>At present, and for the last four weeks, I sit upstairs here, rigorously secret, almost sacred; no mortal, not the very postman or his knock, admitted till two o&#x02019;clock. My Wife has swept and garnished the place for me, curtained, carpeted window-blinded it, really into civilized habitability for the first time; and bids me work or perish. I write daily some quantity of things; which then go into the fire. It is the miserablest kind of task I have, the like of this, which recurs on me duly at intervals. The fire once lit, you have some warmth, tho&#x02019; it is burning away your life; but this miserable quasi-fruitless <hi rend="italic">kindling</hi> of <pb id="pg-13-291" n="13:291"/>the fire, puff-puffing at it as with a pair of asthmatic bellows&#x02014;!&#x02014; The likelihood is, I may fling the bellows down again, and decide upon living tho&#x02019; in a shivering state.</p>
<p>By the way, hinting at Books, I must mention a fact as to <hi rend="italic">The Election a Poem</hi>. It is generally known here, known or guessed among all your friends at least, that you are writer of that work. I had mentioned it absolutely to nobody, nor did yet mention it, but everybody knew;&#x02014;and as everybody approved, what matter? thought I. Well, the other evening, a certain John Forster, your Critic in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster had reviewed <hi rend="italic">The Election,</hi> <date when="1841-04-25">25 April</date>: &#x0201C;Since Crabbe, we have had nothing at all equal to this short poem, in any similar style or province of poetry. And it is thoroughly original.&#x0201D;</note> was standing by this mantelpiece, gazing for novelties, and said, &#x0201C;Whose medallion is this?&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Why that is Sterling&#x02019;s, John Sterling&#x02019;s, the Author of the <hi rend="italic">Election</hi>,&#x0201D; said I, in a moment of unguardedness! Forster (whom Lady Bulwer has called &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Fuzboz</hi> a man of Brummagem enthusiasm&#x0201D;)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rosina, Lady Bulwer, b. Wheeler (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x02013;<date when="1882">82</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17316"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), novelist, separated from Sir Edward Bulwer; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390415-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:87</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-04-15">15 April 1839</date></corr></ref>. In <hi rend="italic">Cheveley; or, the Man of Honour</hi> (<date when="1839">1839</date>) she caricatured Forster as &#x0201C;Mr Fuzboz &#x02026; a sort of lick-dust to Mr. Fonnoir, and to Mr. anybody, and everybody else of celebrity to whom he could get access; he &#x02026; did the theatrical and other plasterings in &#x02018;the Investigator&#x02019;; &#x02026; always having a stock of &#x02018;Brummagem&#x02019; enthusiasm on hand, and being a perfect Boreas at a puff&#x0201D; (3:35&#x02013;36).</note> gave instant sign that he had not already known the secret. What could I do? I swore him to hold his peace; and he, with much laughter, swore,&#x02014;and will keep his oath according to circumstances, I daresay! What was better than our outlook that way, he stated his intention to give a &#x0201C;second notice&#x0201D; of the Poem, for which he had a great &#x00026;c &#x00026;c. This Forster is a most noisy man, but really rather a good fellow (as one gradually finds), and with some substance in his tumultuary brains; a proof of which is that Bulwer does seem to be no longer all of gold to him, as once was the case, but to give fatal symptoms here and there (to Forster&#x02019;s huge astonishment) of being mere scoured brass.</p>
<p>In conclusion I must beg of you to trust me with no more secrets of that kind,&#x02014;secrets which everybody gets to know, and which everybody is liable to be blamed for disclosing; and which, at bottom, might without harm be talked of on the housetops by all men. I have studied to keep this like a masonic word; and yet see, if you do not forgive me, where am I!</p>
<p>You say nothing about <hi rend="italic">Strafford;</hi> which I infer to mean that the Tragedy still lies in the &#x0201C;pottering furnace,&#x0201D; getting the dross, of carbon earth and extraneous alkalis, burnt out of it; in its geometrical shape no change yet visible. I am not sorry for this. Be <hi rend="italic">Strafford</hi> what <pb id="pg-13-292" n="13:292"/>it may, the longer you keep it, my belief is it will grow the better. A &#x0201C;pottering furnace&#x0201D; is expensive to keep up, no doubt of that: but you cannot make steel without one; you make mere pig-iron, not so much as malleable at all! These are truths, my Christian friend; which, if it please the pigs,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371223-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:376</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1837-12-23">23 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> you shall gradually learn somewhat better.</p>
<p>I agree in nearly every word you say about <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, and call your delineation just and vivid both of that Book and its Author as they impress one there. Truly, as you say, moreover, one might ask the question, Whether anybody ever did love this man,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe.</note> as friend does friend; especially, Whether this man did ever frankly love anybody? I think, in one sense, it is very likely the answer were No, to both questions; and yet, in another sense, how emphatically, Yes! Few had a right to &#x0201C;love&#x0201D; this man, except in the very way you mention: nay what living man had? Schiller, perhaps to some extent; and accordingly Schiller did, to something like that extent. One does not <hi rend="italic">love</hi> the Heaven&#x02019;s-lightning, in the way of <hi rend="italic">caresses</hi> altogether! This man&#x02019;s love, I take it, lay deep-hidden in him, as fire in the earth&#x02019;s centre; at the surface,&#x02014;since he could not be a Napoleon, did not like to be a broken self-consumed Burns,&#x02014;what could it do for him? The earliest instincts of self-culture, I suppose, and all the wider insights he got in the course of that would alike prescribe for him: Hide all this, <hi rend="italic">renounce</hi> all this; all this leads to madness, indignity, Rousseauism, and will forever remain bemocked, ignominiously crucified one way or the other, in this lower earth: let thy love, far hidden, spring up as a Soul of Beauty, and be itself victorious beautiful; let <hi rend="italic">summer-heat</hi> make a whole world verdant,&#x02014;and if Sterling ask, next century, &#x0201C;But where is your <hi rend="italic">thunderbolt</hi> then?&#x0201D; Sterling will take another view of it one day!&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; Actually that seems to me the case. But I want a week of time and a quire of paper to explain myself about it. Also a stock of patience greater, I doubt, than that of any Christian friend would be!</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu, adieu</foreign>. Get well, and keep well, my dear Sterling. No danger of our &#x0201C;forgetting&#x0201D; you, of our ever getting &#x0201C;angry&#x0201D; at you&#x02014; Yours always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>According to a promise given to Alick last week, I am to have a word ready for you on Sunday Morning: I hope you will call and get this! It will be a kind of encouragement I suppose to your coming to the Preaching, and make worthy Mr Tait&#x02019;s Sermon go down not the worse.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Tait (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x02013;<date when="1867">67</date>), minister of the Burgher church, Ecclefechan, <date when="1840-06">June 1840</date> until <date when="1867">1867</date>.</note>&#x02014; I meant to write in time for this evening&#x02019;s mail, so that my Letter might have been delivered at Alick&#x02019;s on <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> evening, and thus have needed no calling for. But I was too late with my task; I found it towards 3 o&#x02019;clock; and so had to <hi rend="italic">rush out</hi>, and put this business off till after dinner;&#x02014;at which time accordingly (half past 5 o&#x02019;clock) I am now writing.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I was right glad to hear of you from Jean; and much obliged for your mindfulness in make<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> her write. I had sent <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a short Note, which I think would arrive shortly after Jean wrote. Since that, my Dame has had a Letter from Isabella, which brings the news of Scotsbrig down to a still later date. They all agree in representing you as better than when I was near you, tho&#x02019; none of them assert that you are yet completely got into your old state. You must avoid all occasions of getting yourself hurt, by excitation or otherwise: I do not know, for example, whether you ought to risk yourself away staying about Mary&#x02019;s, in that damp house of theirs, or not? At all events you ought to stay only for a day, or not more than two, and then come home again to your own hearth and <foreign><hi rend="italic">hadding</hi></foreign> [holding]; you are generally best there, I believe. Upon the whole, dear Mother, the gladdest news I got was that <hi rend="italic">you were spinning</hi>,&#x02014;Jean said, almost a dozen in the day! That is what I call excessive spinning; no need for such extreme despatch as that;&#x02014;but I see My Mother is of the same kind of material that I myself am made of, and cannot take any leisure in the doing of her work! Well, you must just spin away: if I could hear of you spinning <hi rend="italic">half</hi> a dozen in the day, I should be well content.</p>
<p>The thing, I dare say, that beyond all others grieves you still is the uncertain situation of poor Jenny. Jean has written to me about her since her return to Dumfries. It seems Mary will require the use of those rooms for herself before long; so that after this present winter Jenny will have to remove elsewhither. This is rather unexpected, I suppose; <pb id="pg-13-294" n="13:294"/>but on the whole, Jenny could not <hi rend="italic">permanently</hi> stay at the Gill; before summer come she may have resolved on some course of her own; and certainly some <hi rend="italic">house</hi> of her own, fit to lodge her and her two children in, will be no deadly matter to get in Dumfriesshire somewhere!&#x02014; I had written to Jenny before Jean&#x02019;s Dumfries Letter came; I am expecting perhaps tomorrow to get some kind of signal from Jenny that the Letter arrived safe. On the whole, dear Mother, you really must not fret yourself any more about that matter: if Jenny even determine on going and joining Rob in America (tho&#x02019; I will by no means advise that), <hi rend="italic">you</hi> really, nor any one of us, have no right to restrain her; she must do the thing that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> finds will be pleasantest and likeliest for her: we actually are no judges of that. People like Rob have been known to reform, when they had been brought down to their beam-ends for a while: I think it is not impossible but he may do some good in America. We must hope the best for poor Jenny, and do all that is in our power to assist her, and guide her: but if she will, reason or no reason, join her lot with his again, I do not see how we could advantageously hinder her, even if hindering lay in our power. But I am convinced she will, on the whole, determine on something that is wise and not foolish; she need do nothing rashly, but take time and choose. She should be encouraged, poor thing, and softly treated; she has much to bear. We will hope too, as I told herself, that all will yet turn out for her instruction and admonition, and be found to be for her good at last.</p>
<p>You ask, kind Mother, whether I sleep well. My sleep and health are as good as when you saw me;&#x02014;and, what is better still, I really think I am going to get to work now! All is as quiet here, as it can be: I keep myself out of the road of everybody; shut up in my upper chamber, trying <hi rend="italic">if I can work</hi>. The only use of living is to do some good work. In the world too there seems need enough of me at present. Am I not happy enough that I am good for something in God&#x02019;s Earth? Courage!

<p>This is the &#x0201C;<date when="1841-11-05">fifth of November</date>,&#x0201D; Gunpowder-Plot day; and a great ringing of bells &#x00026;c there is, and little boys running about to burn the effigy of Guy Faux.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1605-11-05">5 Nov. 1605</date> the plot by some Roman Catholics to blow up the Houses of Parliament was discovered; its leaders, including Guy Fawkes (<date when="1570">1570</date>&#x02013;<date when="1606">1606</date>), were executed, and henceforth the day was celebrated with bonfires.</note> We hear the <foreign><hi rend="italic">jowing</hi></foreign> [ringing] of the bells here even now.

<salute>My dear Isabella</salute>
<p>The packages arrived last night all safe and satisfactory&#x02014; So that we have only been out of meal <hi rend="italic">one night!</hi>&#x02014; This will seem to you hardly credible; but so it is, whether by natural or miralculous<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning &#x0201C;miraculous.&#x0201D;</note> means, the little bag of meal we brought along with us&#x02014;not only became quite excellent after the journey but has held out till Monday last. I was almost glad when Helen said, &#x0201C;you have the last of it now&#x0201D;; for I was beginning to think there was something <hi rend="italic">uncanny</hi> in the business&#x02014; What a glorious prospect of food for many days! such as we starved wretches in towns hardly ever see the like of, buying as we do, I know not why, every thing in pennyworths&#x02014; I can say nothing as to the taste yet of any one article for Carlyle would not leave his work last night to break up the lids&#x02014;but I never saw any thi<supplied>[n]</supplied>g<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> that was not <hi rend="italic">good</hi> come out of your hands and so in my next I expect to tell you that butter cheese meal and bacon is all what the ravenous heart of man could wish it to be&#x02014; I was rather provoked to have to go to bed without seeing my plaid&#x02014;but now I have had it about me for the last two hours. and like it very much indeed&#x02014; C trys to persuade me that I cannot wear such a thing here, in the idea I plainly perceive that he will <hi rend="italic">get it to himself</hi> to go out at nights in&#x02014;but I not only <hi rend="italic">can</hi> but <hi rend="italic">will</hi> wear it!&#x02014;indeed if he kept his eyes open where women are concerned he would perceive that there are hundreds of women going about this winter in plaids of every colour and quality under the sun&#x02014;so that I shall be able to get the good of my comfortable wrappage without exciting the slightest consternation to the fashionable world&#x02014; I have often however regretted that I said anything about it, and so gave you <pb id="pg-13-296" n="13:296"/>all the plague of getting it made for me&#x02014;you have worries enough at home; delicate as you are, without my willfully adding to them&#x02014; And now I wish I could send the shawl <hi rend="italic">by post</hi>&#x02014;as I shall no longer require it&#x02014;but it must wait I suppose till some <hi rend="italic">old clothes</hi> be going&#x02014;as it is not worth carriage by itself&#x02014; If the plaid is not warm enough there will be nothing for me but to <hi rend="italic">wear one</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Mrs Carlyle&#x02019;s blankets</hi> which with the pretty pink border would have a rather dashing effect I imagine!</p>
<p>Today we have a most violent frost&#x02014;every thing covered with ice&#x02014;but I look out upon with a surpri<supplied>[si]</supplied>ng<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> indifference considering the horrible suffering which I have had from the winter<supplied>[s]</supplied> of late years&#x02014; My chest is evidently quite sound again, and I may not die of consumption after all&#x02014;as I confidently anticipated at one time&#x02014;but after all what does it signify which malady one dies of&#x02014;to die of <hi rend="italic">old age</hi> is as bad a way of it as any other<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC wrote to Geraldine Jewsbury, in similar depression, about this time, since Jewsbury answered: &#x0201C;Your letter arrived yesterday. &#x02026; It has created a painful yearning to see you and talk to you. &#x02026; Do not, my love, speak of yourself in such tones. You are not a judge of yourself, or your own case.

<p>My husband is writing an article<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201C;Baillie, the Covenanter.&#x0201D;</note> with such a vengeance that I hardly get twenty words of him thro&#x02019;out the day&#x02014;it is a wonder he has not put himself off sleeping with it; but he has been having much more quiet nights since he came home&#x02014; He professed to be greatly tormented in the first nights by <hi rend="italic">fleas!</hi>&#x02014;but I incline to think it had been only the ghosts of those we slew at <hi rend="italic">newby</hi>&#x02014; Any how I have heard no more of this entirely novel disturbance&#x02014;</p>
<p>Helen goes on very comfortably&#x02014;much more in her element than when you saw her&#x02014;she speaks from time to time of the puddlement at newby with a sort of sacred horror which is really edifying&#x02014; It is a great mercy for me that I have the like of her that I can keep, and who likes to stay with me&#x02014; I should be very solitary in the house if I were as at one time always changing a bad <foreign>scrog</foreign> [broken branch] for a worse&#x02014;</p>

<salute>Dear Marshall,</salute>
<p>We had heard, with much sorrow and sympathy, of the sad event you allude to.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His sister Julia Ann Elliott (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x02013;<date when="1841">41</date>) had d. <date when="1841-11-03">3 Nov.</date> She had m., <date when="1833">1833</date>, Henry Venn Elliott (<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x02013;<date when="1865">1865</date>) and left five children.</note> It would have been too valid an excuse had you forgotten to write at all.</p>
<p>You enter largely into my hasty idea;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x02019;s suggestion in his letter of <date when="1841-10-27">27 Oct.</date> that a radical review be established which he would ed.</note> and approve yourself, what I have understood you to be, a man ready to act,&#x02014;to work, according to your opportunity, in whatsoever seems reasonable and feasible. <hi rend="italic">Much</hi> is entrusted to a man in your place, in these times; and I rejoice always to know that there is one man who does not forget this. <pb id="pg-13-298" n="13:298"/>Were there a hundred such, a thousand such, were all the <hi rend="italic">rich Workers</hi> of England alive to their duty, to their dignity, and real position such as God and Nature have now ordered it here,&#x02014;the <hi rend="italic">rich Idlers</hi> would sing another song shortly; a better time would be beginning for us all!</p>
<p>To the most of what you say about Christianity and Society I have nothing to answer at present but zealous approval. I can also discern, and do at all times discern, much good in such men as Drs Arnold and Whately;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Arnold and Richard Whately (<date when="1787">1787</date>&#x02013;<date when="1863">1863</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29176"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), archbishop of Dublin (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370530-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:218</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-05-30">30 May 1837</date></corr></ref>), a founder along with Arnold of broad church policy, proponent of common nonsectarian religious education.</note> nay their <hi rend="italic">Priest</hi>ship too, which happily is no business of mine, but their own business, clearly enough announces itself to me as one of a most useful class of facts on the part of Nature,&#x02014;the wise thrifty Mother, who wants no wasteful convulsive <hi rend="italic">Suddennesses</hi>, but that all should if possible <hi rend="italic">die quietly;</hi> and so gets good men persuaded to be <hi rend="italic">Priests</hi> and some other things, under very strange circumstances! For the rest, I do not much think either of these two would be first-rate guns in a Periodical; though their talent there too might be turned to use. They have work elsewhere in abundance, if they are inclined to do it; another wing of the great broad harvest to labour in, and reap. On the whole I do not feel that I have much either of friendship or enmity to that great Fact of a Church, called the Church of England here and now: it is <hi rend="italic">a Fact</hi>, which no prudent man addressing England will omit to take note of; even a great Fact,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; I apprehend too its <hi rend="italic">bulk</hi> is very much greater than any real <hi rend="italic">magnitude</hi> it has in these hard times of ours! It shall sail its own voyage for me. Alas, if I hated it much worse than I do, is it not perishing rapidly enough, much too rapidly perhaps, without help of mine?&#x02014; In one thing I must dissent from you, that there should never in any case be Priest<supplied>[s.]</supplied> On the contrary, it is very deeply my conviction that wherever human souls do see the hidden things of God and worship them, there must and will be <hi rend="italic">chosen interpreters</hi> of them,&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">priests</hi>, that is to say,&#x02014;whom the world will pay a most just reverence to, and in all ways assist, honour and forward, if the world has any sense left in it for what is worthy of honour! A true Priest, of what men do verily believe and hold to as their soul&#x02019;s anchor, is the venerablest of all men under the sun. And accordingly, a Sham-Priest, again; or a convulsive, fanatic, <hi rend="italic">would-be-true</hi> Priest, of what men at bottom do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> any longer believe (what we can call <hi rend="italic">believing</hi>) is not he precisely the lamentablest, fatallest,&#x02014;the one you like best to get away from, and leave alone in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> glory! For this reason, I get out of the way of <hi rend="italic">Puseyism</hi>, more speedily than <pb id="pg-13-299" n="13:299"/>of most things; for there seems to me a trace of everlasting truth in it, embedded in <hi rend="italic">deliration</hi> (considering what o&#x02019;clock it now is): a very shocking spectacle! But enough of all that.</p>
<p>Well, certainly it will be a rather grave business, that of starting a Periodical. A thing difficult to succeed in; a thing that ought to be weighed well before it be entered on! There are some radiances of true thought, and valiant endeavour, now visible here and there among us; which it might be a great matter to unite into a light-beam: but it would be a most difficult thing. Ought <hi rend="italic">I</hi> to try it, here where I stand? That is a question which has only flitted once or twice thro&#x02019; my head as yet. It would have to be meditated with quite another gravity, did it ever come in a practical shape; and, alas, most probably the deliberate answer would be&#x02014; What?&#x02014;</p>
<p>For on the whole I have thoughts of my own to utter, <hi rend="italic">which</hi> it is my great interest and work, the utmost I can do in God&#x02019;s world, to get uttered;&#x02014;my own thoughts, howsoever <hi rend="italic">other people&#x02019;s</hi> get themselves uttered and edited! Well, and here already I can do that,&#x02014;not without a certain savage convenience; as of some Arab shiek<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> in the wilderness, whose tent indeed is of rusty camel-skins, and poor and rude in all equipments and conveniences, but whose right-hand holds his own spear,&#x02014;who reverences no &#x0201C;Grand Turk&#x0201D; however blustery;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The post of Grand Vizier (Grand Turk), chief minister of the Ottoman Empire, had been restored, <date when="1839">1839</date>.</note> whose circle of desart is his own, and <hi rend="italic">above</hi> him God only. Certainly I will not quit my camel-skin tent, without well considering of it. I had a rather stiffish fight for it hitherto, and did not get it for nothing! Praise to Allah!&#x02014;</p>
<p>In short, dear Marshall, the <hi rend="italic">thing to be done</hi> at present is to send me that Address,&#x02014;leaving the long-eared <hi rend="italic">Millocrat</hi>-Letters<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411027-TC-JGM-01">TC to JGM, <date when="1841-10-27">27 Oct.</date></ref></note> till better leisure or opportunity!

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Since that going down of the American Timber-ship on one of the banks of the Solway under my window, I do not remember that you <pb id="pg-13-300" n="13:300"/>have heard a word of me. I only added that the men were all saved, and the beach all in agitation, certain women not far from hysterics;&#x02014;and there ended. I did design to send you some announcement of our return hither; but fear there is no chance that I did it! About ten days ago the Signor Gambardella arrived with a Note and Books from you:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the books, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411112-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, [ca. <date when="1841-11-12">12 Nov.</date>]</ref>. Emerson had written, <date when="1841-10-14">14 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;Mr Gambardella, a native of Italy, whence his liberal political opinions drove him to this country some years ago desires to see you during his visit to England whither the love of painting and of pictures draws him. He pleases himself and his friends with the purpose &#x02026; of sending us back some day an effigy of yourself. Mr Gambardella who is only recently known to me is esteemed &#x00026; beloved by good persons, my friends: and beyond our interest in him, you see, has contrived to give us all a personal interest in his acquaintance with you.&#x0201D; Spiridione Gambardella, b. Naples, originally an operatic tenor, become a portrait painter in New York and Boston, <date when="1835">1835</date>&#x02013;<date when="1840">40</date>, before coming to Britain. He exhibited at the Royal Acad. and the British Inst., <date when="1842">1842</date>&#x02013;<date when="1852">52</date>, and apparently at Liverpool. His attempt to paint TC was unsuccessful. He painted JWC, <date when="1843">1843</date>, and Jeannie and John Welsh.</note> and here now is your Letter of <date when="1841-10-30">October 30<hi rend="italic">th;</hi></date> which, arriving at a moment when I have a little leisure, draws forth an answer almost instantly.</p>
<p>The Signor Gambardella, whom we are to see a second time tonight or tomorrow, amuses and interests us not a little. His face is the very image of the Classic God Pan&#x02019;s; with horns and cloven feet we feel that he would make a perfect woodgod;&#x02014;really some of Poussin&#x02019;s Satyrs are almost portraits of this brave Gambardella.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nicolas Poussin (<date when="1594">1594</date>&#x02013;<date when="1665">1665</date>), French historical and landscape painter. Antonio Gallenga, another Italian refugee, described Gambardella as &#x0201C;in the prime of youth &#x02026; a tall and elegant figure, fine Grecian features, and wonderful animal spirits; withal a great versatility of talent which enabled him to take up anything he had a fancy to and become familiar with subjects from which his utter want of elementary studies might be expected to have utterly debarred him. It is thus he dabbled, not without success, in astronomy&#x0201D; (M. C. Wicks, <hi rend="italic">Italian Exiles in London</hi> [Manchester, <date when="1937">1937</date>] 180).</note> I will warrant him a right glowing man of Southern-Italian vitality,&#x02014;full of laughter, wild insight, caricature, and every sort of energy and joyous savagery: a most profitable element to get introduced (in moderate quantity), I should say, into the general current of your Puritan blood over in New England there! Gambardella has behaved with magnanimity in that matter of the Portrait: I have already sat, to men in the like case, some four times, and G. knows it is a dreadful weariness; I directed him, accordingly, to my last Painter one Lawrence a man of real parts, whom I wished G. to know,&#x02014;and whom I wished to know G. withal, that he might tell me whether there was any probability of a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> picture by him in case one did decide on encountering the weariness<supplied>[.]</supplied> Well; G. returns with a magnanimous report that Lawrence&#x02019;s picture<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the portrait exhibited at the Royal Acad.; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410804-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1841-08-04">4 Aug.</date></ref></note> <pb id="pg-13-301" n="13:301"/>far transcends any capability of his; that whoever in America or elsewhere will have a likeness of the said individual must apply to Lawrence not to Gambardella,&#x02014;which latter artist heroically throws down his brush, and says, Be it far from me! The brave Gambardella: if I can get him this night to dilate a little farther on his Visit to the <hi rend="italic">Community of Shakers</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the community at Harvard, Mass., one of the sights of Concord. They were a celibate and communistic sect, popularly named for the dancing that was part of their worship, originating in England, <date when="1747">1747</date>, reaching the U.S., <date when="1774">1774</date>.</note> and the things he saw and felt there, it will be a most true benefit to me. Inextinguishable laughter seemed to me to lie in Gambardella&#x02019;s vision of that Phenomenon,&#x02014;the sight and the seer: but we broke out too loud all at once, and he was afraid to continue.&#x02014; &#x02014; Alas, there is almost no laughter going in the world at present. True laughter is as rare as any other truth,&#x02014;the sham of it frequent and detestable like all other shams. I know nothing wholesomer; but it is rarer even than Christmas, which comes but once a year, and does always come once.</p>
<p>Your satisfactions, and reflexions, at sight of your English Book are such as I too am very thankful for.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written on receiving the British edn. of his <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> with TC&#x02019;s pref., <date when="1841-10-30">30 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;It seems I am to speak in England&#x02014;great England&#x02014;fortified by the good word of one whose word is fame. Well it is a lasting joy to be indebted to the wise &#x00026; generous; and I am well content that my little boat should swim, whilst it can, beside your great galleys. Nor will I allow my discontent with the great faults of the book&#x02014;which the rich English dress cannot hide,&#x02014;to spoil my joy in this fine little romance of friendship &#x00026; hope. I am determined &#x02026; to send you something better another day.&#x0201D; Slater points out that it was rumored in <date when="1842">1842</date> that Emerson &#x0201C;did not like the patronizing strain of Carlyle&#x02019;s preface to his volume of essays&#x0201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 308).</note> I understand them well. May worse guest never visit the Drawing-room at Concord than that bound Book. Tell the good Wife to rejoice in it: she has all the pleasure;&#x02014;to her poor Husband it will be increase of pain withal: nay let us call it increase of valiant labour and endeavour; no evil for a man, if he be fit for it! A man must learn to digest praise too and not be poisoned with it: some of it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> wholesome to the system under certain circumstances; the most of it a healthy system will learn by and by to throw into the slop-bason, harmlessly, without any <hi rend="italic">trial</hi> to digest it. A Thinker, I take it, in the long-run finds that essentially he must ever be and continue <hi rend="italic">alone;</hi>&#x02014;alone: &#x0201C;silent, rest over him the stars, and under him the graves!&#x0201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe&#x02019;s &#x0201C;Symbolum,&#x0201D; trans. by TC as &#x0201C;Mason-Lodge,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 10:237.</note> The clatter of the world, be it a friendly be it a hostile world, shall not intermeddle with him much.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; The Book of Essays, however, does decidedly &#x0201C;speak <supplied>[to]</supplied> England,&#x0201D; in its way, in these months; and even makes what one may call a kind of appropriate &#x0201C;sensation&#x0201D; here. Reviews of it are many, in all notes of the <pb id="pg-13-302" n="13:302"/>gamut;&#x02014;of small value mostly; as you might see by the two Newspaper specimens I sent you (Did you get these two Newspapers?). The worst enemy admits that there are piercing radiances of perverse insight in it; the highest friends, some few, go to a very high point indeed. Newspapers are busy with extracts;&#x02014;much complaining that it is &#x0201C;abstruse,&#x0201D; neological, hard to get the meaning of. All which is very proper. Still better,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; poor Fraser, alas is dead (poor Fraser!), and no help could come from industries of the Bookshop, and Books indeed it seems were never selling worse than of late months&#x02014;I learn that the &#x0201C;sale of the Essays goes very steadily forward,&#x0201D; and will wind itself handsomely up in due time, we may believe! So Emerson henceforth has a real Public in Old England as well as New. And finally my Friend, do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> disturb yourself about turning <hi rend="italic">better</hi> &#x00026;c &#x00026;c; write as it is given you, and not till it be given you, and never mind it a whit.</p>
<p>The new <hi rend="italic">Adelphi</hi> piece seems to me, as a piece of composition, the best <hi rend="italic">written</hi> of them all.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Method of Nature.

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Where in the wide earth are you? If anywhere above ground, I beg for a word from you. Those kind laughing eyes, what scene do they now look on; what mortals hear now that half-serious, half-quizzing wholly-friendly voice? Tell me whether you are at Fryston, or where you are.</p>
<p>I called at your house here, some days after my arrival, while Sir Peel and the National Palaver were still sitting:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Between <date when="1841-09-22">22 Sept.</date>, when TC returned to London, and <date when="1841-10-07">7 Oct.</date>, when parliament was prorogued. Milnes was at Fryston. He had been disappointed not to receive office in Peel&#x02019;s govt. He wrote to Guizot, <date when="1841-09-07">7 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;you may thus be surprised that I occupy no place. But I have no right to complain, when Peel has, in fact, taken upon himself the only post I had the least desire to fill&#x02014;that of Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs&#x0201D; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:271).</note> my hopes to meet you were baulked; a voice answered, &#x0201C;He is just gone abroad&#x0201D;; and as it was the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Lippulus</hi></foreign> [little bleary-eyed one], Tailorkin, or whatever he is, that spake, no farther details could be drawn from him. I remembered America; I hastily concluded, America. Some one afterwards told me that it was France; then again I hear rumour of Yorkshire. Gentle Shepherd, prithee say!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Samuel Howard, &#x0201C;Gentle Shepherd, tell me where.&#x0201D;</note>&#x02014; Above all, if you could tell me when I am to see you again? <hi rend="italic">Sights</hi> do abound in this world; but so few of those are worth seeing,&#x02014;ah me! There is but one Richard Milnes now exant in the Solar System for us.</p>
<p>It was a most strange discovery for me, not knowing what course the Darlington Railway would take with us to Town, that night my Wife and I set off,&#x02014;to discover Castleford and the woods of Fryston; to see your white <hi rend="italic">gazebo</hi> under the gleam of the stars, and think of so many things! Whirled past, rapidly off into the Night, by Destiny and Steam! It is the way the gods often have with us poor men of mould.</p>
    <p>Rio writes to me from Viroflay near Paris. He has been <foreign><hi rend="italic">vers&#xE9;</hi></foreign> [thrown down], he and Montalamvert, on the streets of Vannes (<hi rend="italic">venetiae <pb id="pg-13-304" n="13:304"/>Britonum</hi>),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexis Fran&#xe7;ois Rio. Charles Forbes Ren&#xE9;, Count de Montalembert (<date when="1810">1810</date>&#x02013;<date when="1870">70</date>), French journalist and politician, champion of the interests of liberal catholicism. TC spells &#x0201C;Montalamvert.&#x0201D; Vannes is a seaport in Brittany, ancient capital of the Celtic tribe the Veneti.</note> and had his hand lamed; is full of &#x0201C;faith&#x0201D; (in the old Triple-hatted Chimera),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Papacy.</note> of friendliness to man; is polishing his Book; reading Emerson, &#x00026;c. I continue to like Rio. Poor Jeffrey, as you perhaps know, is still very poorly; out near Hertford at Empson&#x02019;s place; but purposed to remove into Town, and I suppose continue there, about this very time.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey had written, <date when="1841-10-27">27 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;If I am able to move I think I shall come to London for a short time about the <date when="1841-11">middle of Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>&#x02014;when I trust we may shake hands.&#x0201D; He also wrote: &#x0201C;I can not but smile at the picture you draw of idle misery&#x02014;and your working misery&#x02014;I know you are not so miserable as your words might imply. &#x02026; But, if you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be miserable, in one form or another, I beg that (if it does not make any difference to you) you would indulge oftenest in the laborious vein&#x02014;from which all the rest of the world will profit.&#x0201D;</note> No other of your men have I come athwart of late. I have lived amazingly solitary, ever since you last saw me; indeed, ever since you drove me down to the Railway, and set me adrift again, last spring. It is absolutely indispensable for me to be a good-deal alone, with my own ugly self. I hope gradually to learn the art even here in Babel,&#x02014;since my life seems cast here: One has to do like the fabulous salamander: learn to live in fire! The poor salamander throws out icy effluences, they say; isolates itself, makes the furnace-temperature pretty comfortable to all feelings in the end. It is a considerable secret.</p>
<p>I cover much paper with ink, of late; but swiftly burn it almost all again. The world knows not how much it is obliged to me.</p>
<p>Emerson&#x02019;s Essays succeed, I understand; so much the better. The man himself I find is highly gratified with us. Poor fellow, he will now have to see, now first, what of real stuff there is in him; whether he will expand, or merely <hi rend="italic">burst</hi>, as the most do!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Perhaps you can without much difficulty point out to me in what part of &#xc6;neas Sylvius, Pope Pius the Second&#x02019;s Works that <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> of his about Scotland<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pope Pius II (<date when="1405">1405</date>&#x02013;<date when="1464">64</date>), known as Aeneas Silvius or Sylvius, patron of learning and prolific writer. In his letter, <date when="1841-11-23">23 Nov.</date>, Laing gave TC the reference in <hi rend="italic">Commentarii</hi> (Frankfurt, <date when="1614">1614</date>) 4&#x02013;5. See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420117-TC-DL-01">TC to DL, <date when="1842-01-17">17 Jan. 1842</date></ref>.</note> (written I think when he was Legate there, and quoted by Pinkerton<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Pinkerton.</note> and many others) is to be found. The <hi rend="italic">Opera &#xc6;neas Sylvii</hi> are very accessible in our Museum here; but no individual who can in the slightest afford one any guidance in such an inquiry exists about that Establishment. I would go and read the Letter some day, if I were sure beforehand that my patience would not fail before so much as discovering it in that imbroglio of a place!</p>
<p>Allow me yet another question. In Nicholson&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Historical Library</hi> I find that various Topographical <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi> of Gordon of Straloch&#x02019;s were bequeathed to Sir R. Sibbald; among others a &#x0201C;Description of the Stewartie of An<supplied>[n]</supplied>andale,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> with a Map &#x00026;c by Mr Johnston a Minister there&#x0201D; (Nicholson, p. 6. edition <date when="1776">1776</date>), something also &#x0201C;on Niddisdale,&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;Galloway and Dumfriesshire&#x0201D; generally. These pieces Nicholson intimates that Sibbald meant to print or turn to use: now if you could tell me, Whether he did print them, and if so, under what title, in what part of Sir Robert&#x02019;s Works one can get hold of them?&#x02014; I do not expect you to take much trouble about this, for it is not of much importance to me; but if you can answer without difficult research, doubtless you will so far oblige me.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Nicolson, <hi rend="italic">The English, Scotch and Irish Historical Libraries</hi>. &#x02026; <hi rend="italic">A new edition. corrected</hi> (<date when="1776">1776</date>). Robert Gordon of Straloch (<date when="1580">1580</date>&#x02013;<date when="1661">1661</date>), geographer and genealogist. Sir Robert Sibbald (<date when="1641">1641</date>&#x02013;<date when="1722">1722</date>), pres. of the Edinburgh Royal College of Physicians, physician to Charles II, Geographer of Scotland, author of many geographical and antiquarian works. In his reply, Laing wrote: &#x0201C;I think I may venture to say that the Description of Annandale you mention has never been printed. The MS. is no doubt with the rest of Sir Robert Sibbald&#x02019;s Collections in the Advocates Library. He proposed at one time (about the end of Charles the Second&#x02019;s Reign) to publish an Atlas of Scotland, consisting very much of similar contributions with our Statistical Accounts&#x02014;but the returns he obtained to the Proposals he issued were few &#x00026; inconsiderable. One of them, Wallace&#x02019;s Account of the Orkneys, he himself publ<hi rend="italic">d</hi> in or about <date when="1693">1693</date>, and another, Symm&#x02019;s Description of Galloway, was printed in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> within 15 years or so. You might glance at this last, as the Appendix contains some smaller Descriptions, but I cannot readily put my hands on a copy just at this moment.&#x0201D; He referred to Sibbald, <hi rend="italic">An Account of the Scotish Atlas, or the Description of Scotland ancient and modern</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1683">1683</date>), James Wallace, <hi rend="italic">A Description of the Isles of Orkney. &#x02026; To which is added, An Essay concerning the Thule of the Ancients</hi> [<hi rend="italic">by Sibbald</hi>] (Edinburgh, <date when="1693">1693</date>), and not Symm, but Andrew Symson, <hi rend="italic">A Large Description of Galloway</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1823">1823</date>), written <date when="1684">1684</date>. It had seven further descriptions in the Appendix.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-306" n="13:306"/>I believe there is an Article on <hi rend="italic">Baillie&#x02019;s Letters</hi> coming out in the next <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x02019;s own article.</note> Your third Volume, I hope, is in a state of forwardness.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laing replied, <date when="1841-11-23">23 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;I am keeping very hard at the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> vol. of Master Robert&#x02014;and the half of it is through the press&#x02014;but the other half will require 3 or 4 months even with close daily application.&#x0201D;</note> Baillie, a kind of &#x0201C;inspired blockhead,&#x0201D; yields more result the more one inspects him.</p>

<salute>Dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>Here is the American Letter you spoke of:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From their half-brother, John Carlyle, who had settled nr. Brantford, Ontario, 60 mi SW of Toronto. For his letter to Alexander, <date when="1841-09-28">28 Sept.</date>, see Marrs 528&#x02013;29.</note> it arrived yesterday; and today, after shewing it to John, I send it to you. I do not exactly know what part of Canada it is dated from; but the place lies some hundreds of miles Northwest of where your Husband is likely to be. Our Brother seems to be going on in a very prosperous way there.</p>
<p>On Sunday last, the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> shewed me a Letter he had written for you: it appeared to be full of rational advice, in all of which I agree. You must pluck up a spirit, my good little Jenny, and see clearly how many things you yourself, independent of all other persons, can still do. <hi rend="italic">You</hi>, there, can either act like a wise courageous person, or like a fool; between which two ways of it there lies still all the difference in the world for you! As Jack says, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have done nothing to degrade yourself; it was another than you. I assert and believe always that no person whatever can be ruined except <hi rend="italic">by his own consent, by his own act</hi>, in this world.&#x02014; Your little <foreign>bairn</foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary (b. <date when="1840-12-24">24 Dec. 1840</date>).</note> will get to walk; then you will have more time to set to some kind of employment; this will be your first consolation.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The sight of your Card instead of yourself, the other day when I came down stairs, was a real vexation to me. The orders here are rigorous: &#x0201C;Hermetically sealed till 2 o&#x02019;clock!&#x0201D; But had you chanced to ask for my Wife, she would have guessed that you formed an exception, and would have brought me down. We must try it another way. For example:</p>
<p>The evenings at present, when not rainy, are bright with moonlight. We are to be at home on friday night, and alone: could you not be induced to come and join us? Tea is at six or half past six.&#x02014; If you say nothing, let us take silence for Yes, and expect you!</p>
<p>Or if another night than friday will suit you better, propose another; and from me in like manner, let no answer mean Yes and welcome.</p>
<p>At any rate contrive to see me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is not known whether Browning accepted the invitation at the time suggested, but he certainly took no offense at not being allowed to see TC several days before this note was written. On <date when="1841-12-30">30 Dec.</date> he wrote to Euphrasia Fanny Haworth: &#x0201C;I dined with dear Carlyle and his wife (catch me calling people &#x02018;dear,&#x02019; in a hurry, except in letter-beginnings!) yesterday&#x02014; I don&#x02019;t know any people like them&#x02014;there was a son of Burns&#x02019; there, Major Burns whom Macready knows&#x02014;he sung &#x02018;Of all the airts&#x02019;&#x02014;&#x02018;John Anderson&#x02019;&#x02014;and another song of his father&#x02019;s&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Letters of Robert Browning Collected by Thomas J.

<salute>My dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Your imaginations are of the kindest; but alas the fact they point to is inexecutable, impossible! I must not think of Fryston again till&#x02014;nobody knows when.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Replying from Fryston, <date when="1841-11-21">21 Nov.</date>, to <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411119-TC-RMM-01">TC&#x02019;s letter of <date when="1841-11-19">19 Nov.</date></ref> Milnes said: &#x0201C;You ask, when shall we meet again? as soon as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> choose: you have only to put yourself on the eternal Rail &#x02026; &#x00026; be landed at Castleford any night or morn. The weather is as accursed as usual, nay a little more so, &#x00026; you can have the same steed to ride upon with sharpened hoofs, &#x00026; the same big room to smoke in over a double fire, &#x00026; if you will come double with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle, why so much the better.&#x0201D;</note> It will behove me, in the name of all gods and demons, to sit here at the bottom of my inkwell, in this horrible black Babylon (whose fog-atmosphere does often seem to me in the <date when="--11">November</date> time like <hi rend="italic">ink</hi> or Spartan broth, a fluid not a gas); and ascertain whether there does lie in me any farther stroke of work, yea or no. Hitherto all work I do is as that of a mole; invisible, uncertain whether extant or only semblant: I write some things, but straight&#x02019;way burn them: am not I a hopeful man! In the general retrospect and estimate of life, I find simply what little fractions of work one has done, or even honestly tried to do; that and nothing else at all: the rest is not worth sixpence a century;&#x02014;or rather one would demand something considerable to boot, or reject the bargain altogether!&#x02014; You call me a <hi rend="italic">Pessimist?</hi> No, my friend: I am a kind of <hi rend="italic">Optimist</hi> withal; very literally so: therein lies the contradiction; which is but an apparent one, and arises from &#x0201C;the nature of the beast.&#x0201D; The practical fact is, I must try to get something put on paper that <hi rend="italic">will</hi> stand when put: a little work once behind me, how gladly shall I rush forth (if the Upper Power permit) to salute the new spring skies; and say or feel with my whole soul to the old-new Earth and Universe (all Spartan broth and puddlement of men left far behind me): <foreign><hi rend="italic">Salve magna parens</hi></foreign> [Hail great parent]!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Georgics</hi> 2:173.</note></p>
<p>It is almost strange to myself how memorable Fryston, with its porches, parks, and all the environment of it far and wide, now dwells with me; clearer, I might almost say, and more beautiful, than when I looked on it with eyes. Good old Yorkshire,&#x02014;a kind of embellished Scotland. Rivers rushing sea-ward with their ancient voice (not voiceless muddy ditch-rivers as here); airy hill-tops, with outlook over wide fruitful expanses; and ever in the distance some Leeds, some Wakefield <pb id="pg-13-310" n="13:310"/>sending up its great black smoke-<foreign>coulisse</foreign>, its great black banner, which announces, &#x0201C;Behold, O Squire, I too am here!&#x0201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi> 24:123.</note>&#x02014; By the way can you tell me which &#x0201C;travelled bishop&#x0201D; it was that the Yorkshire Christians all ran to see, and &#x0201C;broke the wood bridge over the Aire,&#x0201D;&#x02014;and so gave the name <hi rend="italic">Broken-bridge</hi> to that exemplary Burough of yours? Camden says it was called Kirby in Saxon times, and till that accident.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes was M.P. for Pontefract, derived from the Latin for &#x0201C;broken bridge.&#x0201D; Although already called Pontefract in <date when="1140">1140</date>, the name supposedly commemorated the preservation from drowning of those who fell in the river, <date when="1153">1153</date>, when the bridge gave way under crowds greeting St. William, archbishop of York. William Camden (<date when="1551">1551</date>&#x02013;<date when="1623">1623</date>), <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi> (<date when="1586">1586</date>), an account of the British Isles from earliest times; the change from Kirkby to Pontefract is not satisfactorily explained.</note> He also informs me that Edward Longshanks had a son born in Brotherton, his Queen being suddenly taken ill there; known afterwards to all persons as John de Brotherton.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward I (<date when="1239">1239</date>&#x02013;<date when="1307">1307</date>), king of England. His son John (by Eleanor of Castile) d. in infancy; the son b. at Brotherton (by Edward&#x02019;s second wife, Margaret) was Thomas of Brotherton (<date when="1300">1300</date>&#x02013;<date when="1338">38</date>), earl of Norfolk.</note> Many a time also do I reflect on that King&#x02019;s Stone-coffin which now stands in your Garden:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas (<date when="1277">1277</date>?&#x02013;<date when="1322">1322</date>), earl of Lancaster, was beheaded at St. Thomas&#x02019;s Hill, just outside the town limits of Pontefract. A stone coffin, containing a skeleton, was unearthed on the Milnes&#x02019;s land nearby, <date when="1822">1822</date>. Assuming it to be the lost miracle-working body of St. Thomas, Milnes&#x02019;s grandmother had the bones encased in lead, and the stone coffin containing them put in the gardens at Fryston Hall &#x0201C;with a triangular bit to be lifted out of the lid, so that religious persons may look in.&#x0201D; It remained throughout Milnes&#x02019;s lifetime in a shrubbery near the house. See James Pope-Hennessy, <hi rend="italic">Monckton Milnes: The Years of Promise</hi> (<date when="1949">1949</date>) 83.</note> once a <hi rend="italic">King</hi>, strutting about with trumpeters blowing round it, long trains trailing after it; now shrunk together into dust and old leather, and come to serve as a Museum curiosity! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu, pepae, eheu</hi></foreign> [Alas, alack]! Good Heavens, could Domdaniel<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Infernal cave.</note> be any stranger, can either Heaven or Hell be any stranger than this Earth in York and other shires already is?</p>
<p>I know not why I babble all this; for really my time is not the amplest at present,&#x02014;and I am a known friend of <hi rend="italic">Silence</hi>. On the whole, I wish you were here. There are very few people I care to talk with in the world just now; and yet speech too has its uses, and there is a time for it as for its antagonist.</p>
<p>That was, as you say, a daring attempt on the part of James Marshall, in these distressed times!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes had written, <date when="1841-11-21">21 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;James Marshall goes on agitating. &#x02026; I wonder he can do so, in the present distress of the people.&#x0201D; For Marshall&#x02019;s agitation on behalf of the manufacturing classes, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411027-TC-JGM-01">TC to JGM, <date when="1841-10-27">27 Oct.</date></ref> and <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411207-TC-JGM-01">TC to JGM, <date when="1841-12-07">7 Dec.</date></ref></note> His Brother William came upon me <pb id="pg-13-311" n="13:311"/>yesterday; mentioned among other things that Her Majesty, Queen Victory, was to be godmother.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Victor, b. <date when="1841-11-16">16 Nov.</date> William James Marshall (<date when="1796">1796</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872">1872</date>), M.P. for Carlisle; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390619-TC-MAC-01"><sic>11:129</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1839-06-19">19 June 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> Queen Victory, as you know, is one of the standing miracles of this age to me, poor little dame.&#x02014; I finished in a long argument with Marshall yesterday about the probable Future of Sir R.

Truly I will confess, of all the as yet articulate and speaking classes or parties of this Count<supplied>[r]</supplied>y,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> Conservatism blind and lazy as it is does embody most of the religion, of the loyalty, humanity and available worth that exists among us.

You told me once with great seriousness, &#x0201C;Peel, was a man of <hi rend="italic">real talent</hi>,&#x0201D; a great man. Pray Heaven it prove so. If he be a man of really great talent, it seems clear to me he will endeavour somewhat as I say;&#x02014;and may be, at such an epoch, the blessedest minister this country ever had. But alas, alas! If he be, on the other hand a mere red-tapist, and cunning Parliamenteer, ten times as cunning as Parliamenteer ever was before, he too will go to Staves<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., be broken.</note> in a little while, and be flung out like rubbish, as the rest have been.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Jean&#x02019;s Letter having informed me punctually where you now are, I must not let the week end without giving you a word of intelligence. You know how busy I am, and will be satisfied with a very brief hasty word.</p>
<p>I wish I knew that you were sleeping well, and going well on, at Dumfries: I know they will be as kind to you as it is possible for human creatures to be; but you are easily thrown off your beat, and it does not take much to hurt you. I can only say: Take care of yourself, dear Mother;&#x02014;and if you find that you are getting out of sorts, make off straightway for your own <foreign>hadding</foreign> [holding]!</p>
<p>John had a Letter last week from Jenny, in answer to his, which probably you saw. Jenny writes in better spirits, this time; and seems more composed and reconciled to her situation. Jack, I suppose, has himself written to you or Jean at Dumfries: he was about sending off a Box of old garments &#x00026;c; and it was to be directed to James Aitken&#x02019;s care. We meet always once a-week; and have a long talk and smoke together, after the dinner is transacted; and then a convoying along the streets, in dry or wet weather: the distance between our dwellings is four miles and rather more; I have never tried to make a <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> visit there yet, the distance and the uncertainty are both so great. Jack seems very cheerful: his work is dull and stupid; but, as I tell him, it might easily have a worse fault!&#x02014; He agrees with me that perhaps Jenny&#x02019;s likeliest scheme may be some kind of establishment of her own, after Whitsunday; perhaps near Jean in Dumfries, or that quarter? But she ought to be left as much as possible to form a <hi rend="italic">scheme <pb id="pg-13-313" n="13:313"/>of her own;</hi> those that wish her good can then more hopefully forward her in that. Rob,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hanning.</note> at best, cannot know for some time what is to become of him, on the other side of the water.</p>
<p>My Review Article is printed, or getting itself printed: it will come out, I suppose, about New-Years-day. It is not of almost any significance. But I will endeavour to get you a copy and send it. The poor Editor is in the highest degree civil, does all he can to attach me to writing for him: but he is a <hi rend="italic">Dud</hi>, and his Review is a <hi rend="italic">Dud</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1841-12-13">13 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;Trifling Article on <hi rend="italic">Baillie&#x02019;s Letters and Journals</hi> coming out shortly&#x02026;: I have written nothing else. Hickson&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi> is a most beggarly Review; but the man solicits me, is extremely civil to me, pays as well as any other;&#x02014;needs no negotiation.&#x0201D;</note> The thing I mean to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> is not reviews at present!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote, under the same date, about his work on Cromwell and his times: &#x0201C;My constant employment reading History Books, especially such as treat of the Civil War. It is amazing how little I <hi rend="italic">learn</hi>, read as I may. The Books keep me myself <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi>, with painful intensity, How the matter <hi rend="italic">could have</hi> been?&#x02014; and do little more for me at all. What will become of it?&#x02014; To resuscitate a <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> century is no slight enterprise! And yet the reward of utmost possible success, seems rather likely to be small. &#x02026; To work now: on Strafford or on something!&#x0201D;</note></p>
<p>No arrangement has yet been made in the affairs of Fraser; so that I still wait for my Accounts, uncertain what the extent of them may be. His business was very flourishing, I believe; probably they mean to charge high for the <hi rend="italic">good-will</hi> and connexion, and so find it difficult to fall in with a purchaser.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; On the other hand, I got &#xa3;40 the other night sent out of America, part of my friends&#x02019;s profits for me there!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This was the money from James Munroe &#x00026; Co., promised by Emerson in his letter of <date when="1841-10-30">30 Oct.</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411119-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1841-11-19">19 Nov.</date></ref></note> It is curious; like manna raining out of the clouds: I did not feel as if working for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> at all.</p>
<p>Poor Shakland the Tailor at Thornhill,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Shankland; TC wrote &#x0201C;Shakland.&#x0201D;</note> I ascertain, is dead. He was a respectable character, a man of much intelligence; I had a real sorrow to hear of his death.</p>
<p>Nothing can be uglier than our weather here; wind, rain and mud;&#x02014;worse than rain, a detestable kind of <foreign><hi rend="italic">dag</hi></foreign> [drizzle], a degree fainter than <hi rend="italic">Scotch-mist</hi>, which abounds here at this season more than anywhere I think, and ought to be called <hi rend="italic">Middlesex mist</hi> rather! They do call it &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">muggy</hi> weather&#x0201D;; meaning thereby all that is scandalous in weather: for it is warm withal, you do not like to wear wrappage; and the <hi rend="italic">mud</hi>, ground by millions of feet and wheels, is like no other mud in the world: it would make indifferently good <hi rend="italic">paint</hi>, as I sometimes say. Occasionally, however, there is a bright beautiful day; and then <pb id="pg-13-314" n="13:314"/>all dries, and grows cheerful in an hour or two.&#x02014; The distress of the people in the poor districts here I believe to be very great: all over England I suppose it never was greater.</p>
<p>Mr Clyde&#x02019;s son had left a card for me here, while I was in Annandale. A good many weeks ago, I wrote him a Note of invitation to tea: he answered, not from London, but from a place some two or three score miles off (if I remember), whither he is now gone. He seems to be a very good-humoured happy young man,&#x02014; not without a dash of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">gomeril</hi></foreign> [half-wit], as I judged.

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x02019; I wrote to you very lately, and am in great haste today, I must lose no time in announcing that the Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1841-11-14">14 Nov.</date></note> with the &#xa3;40 draught came to hand some mornings ago; and now, this same morning, a second Letter round by Dumfriesshire, which had been sent as a duplicate, or substitute in case of accident, for the former. It is all right, my friend: Samuel Ward&#x02019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1841-11-14">14 Nov.</date>, of Ward as &#x0201C;a lover of yours who expresses great satisfaction in doing us this courtesy; and courtesy I must think it when he gives me a bill <hi rend="italic">on sight</hi> whilst of all other merchants I have got only one payable at some remote day. Sam Ward is a beautiful &#x00026; noble youth of a most subtle &#x00026; magnetic nature, made for an artist, a painter, &#x00026; in his art has made admirable sketches, but his criticism, I fancy was too keen for his poetry (shall I say?); he sacrificed to Despair, &#x00026; threw away his pencil. For the present he buys and sells.&#x0201D; Samuel Gray Ward (<date when="1817">1817</date>&#x02013;<date when="1917">1917</date>), friend of Margaret Fuller and Emerson, contrib. to <hi rend="italic">The Dial</hi>, at the time working with his father in the American agency of Baring Bros. &#x00026; Co., British bankers.</note> paper has got itself changed into <pb id="pg-13-315" n="13:315"/>forty gold sovereigns, and lies here waiting use; thanks, many thanks! Sums of that kind come always upon me like manna out of the sky; surely they, more emphatically than any others, are the gift of Heaven. Let us receive, use, and be thankful. I am not so poor now at all, Heaven be praised: indeed I do not know, now and then when I reflect on it, whether being <hi rend="italic">rich</hi> were not a considerably harder problem. With the wealth of Rothschild<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The family of Jewish financiers; the London branch was headed by Lionel Nathan Rothschild (<date when="1808">1808</date>&#x02013;<date when="1879">79</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24160"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).</note> what farther good thing could one get,&#x02014;if not perhaps some but to live in, under free skies, in the country, with a horse to ride and have a little less pain on! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Angulus ille ridet!</hi></foreign><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201C;<foreign>Ille terrarum mihi praeter omnis / Angelus ridet</foreign> [No place on earth smiles on me so much as this]&#x0201D; (Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> 2.6.13).</note>&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; I will add, for practical purposes in the future, that it is in general of little or no moment whether an American Bill be at sight or after a great many days; that the paper can wait as conveniently here as the cash can,&#x02014;if your New-england House and Baring of Old England will forbear bankruptcy in the meanwhile. By the bye, will you tell me some time or other in <hi rend="italic">what</hi> American funds it is that your funded money, you once gave me note of, now lies? I too am a creditor to America,&#x02014;state of Illinois or some such State: 1000 dollars of mine, which some years ago I had no use for, now lies there, paying I suppose for canals, in a very obstructed condition!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1838">1838</date> TC and his brother John purchased a $1,000 bond, paying 6% annual interest, issued by the State of Illinois; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381226-TC-JAC-01"><sic>10:250</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1838-12-26">26 Dec. 1838</date></corr></ref>, also <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410922-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1841-09-22">22 Sept.</date></ref></note> My Brother here is continually telling me that I shall lose it all,&#x02014;which is not so bad; but lose it all by my own unreason,&#x02014;which is very bad.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson replied, <date when="1842-02-28">28 Feb. 1842</date>: &#x0201C;I grieve to hear that you have bought any of our wretched Southern stocks. &#x02026; Massachusetts stock is in the best credit of any public stock. Ward told me that it would be safest for you to <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> your Illinois stock, although he could say nothing very good of it.&#x0201D;</note> It struck me I would ask where Emerson&#x02019;s money lies, and lay mine there too, let it live or perish as it likes!</p>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">Adelphi</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The oration <hi rend="italic">The Method of Nature</hi>.</note> went straightway off to Miss Martineau with a message.

I also gave a Morning-Chronicle Editor your brave eulogy on Landor, with instructions that it were <pb id="pg-13-316" n="13:316"/>well worth publishing there, for Landor&#x02019;s and others&#x02019; sake.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Excerpts from the article appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1841-12-25">25 Dec.</date></note> Landor deserves more praise than he gets at present; the world too, what is far more, should hear of him oftener than it does.

<salute>My dear Marshall,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your new Letter; for your printed missives too, the last set of which arrived duly some days ago. I have read them all. In your own Addresses I rejoice to find a tone of right hearty earnest<supplied>[ness]</supplied>, out of which, one way or other, good will not fail to come. The thing stated in them is true; the manner of stating it too has a real truth in it,&#x02014;I mean a real honesty and humanity.</p>
<p>None of the others please me much. Hamer Stansfield speaks like a commonplace radical;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hamer Stansfeld, <hi rend="italic">Household Suffrage and Re-distribution of Electoral Districts Considered; in a Series of Letters to the Editors of the Leeds Mercury</hi> (<date when="1841">1841</date>)</note> in a hardheaded, but altogether coarse, harsh and shortsighted way: if his opinion be true, That all men are hungry Egoists, that &#x0201C;supply and demand&#x0201D; is the ultimate gospel, and the Soul of Man nothing other than the Stomach of Man,&#x02014;then I say our miseries are <hi rend="italic">ir</hi>remediable, and we may as well at once lie down and die, without more of useless noise about it! <hi rend="small-caps">benthamism</hi>, in all shapes, has had its say out now; and men, during the last ten years, have <pb id="pg-13-317" n="13:317"/>looked earnestly for the &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">do</hi>&#x0201D; of it; and found no <hi rend="italic">&#x0201C;do&#x0201D;;</hi> alas, no verb <sic>of of</sic> that kind in its vocabulary: wherefore let it withdraw in Heaven&#x02019;s name,&#x02014;or talk only in remote quarters, very remote indeed.</p>
<p>As for Holland,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Calvert Holland.</note> no more perfect ass has come across me for a long while: loud, unmelodious, stupid; altogether of a supreme stupidity. Yet he too means at bottom something; and even, in his darkness and insolent platitude, is groping towards a great thing. I told you once, we must have industrial <hi rend="italic">barons</hi>, of a quite new suitable sort; workers <hi rend="italic">loyally</hi> related to their taskmasters,&#x02014;related in God (as we may well say); not related in Mammon alone! This will be the real aristocracy, in place of the sham one; a thing far from us, alas; but infallibly arriving for us;&#x02014;infallibly, as I think, unless we are to go to wreck altogether.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x0201C;Captains of Industry,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi> 10:270&#x02013;76.</note> This the poor ass Holland has some feeling of, in a most dim manner; and he brays accordingly: &#x0201C;The Corn-Law and the Suffrage are by no means the solution of the matter.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>In fact I feel myself surprised at the entire faith you all seem to have in Suffrage; I for my own share having so very little! What is the importance of <hi rend="italic">modes of electing</hi> till there be a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> here and there worthy of being elected? If mere carrion exist in the market, what matter how it is weighed out? A people that has nothing to elect but Humes, O&#x02019;Connells<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Hume (<date when="1777">1777</date>&#x02013;<date when="1855">1855</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14148"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), radical politician, unsuccessfully contested Leeds in <date when="1841-06">June</date>, but was elected M.P. for Montrose, <date when="1842-04">April 1842</date>. Daniel O&#x02019;Connell (<date when="1775">1775</date>&#x02013;<date when="1847">1847</date>; <ref target="volume-13/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20501"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Irish nationalist, M.P. for Cork since <date when="1841-07">July</date>. For TC on Hume, O&#x02019;Connell, and the House of Commons, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310817-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:340&#x02013;41</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-17">17 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref> (Hume&#x02019;s dates there transposed incorrectly with Sir Charles Wetherell&#x02019;s).</note> and such like, is welcome to elect them in what way it pleases or can!&#x02014; It gives me real pain to have no faith at all in extension of suffrage at present.&#x02014; Yet I heartily honor you who do pursue it, while it is your conviction. Across that pursuit too, I discern all manner of tendencies in you, which have my entire sympathy, which seem to me the best and truest. Persist, persist!</p>
<p>Your Brother the Member called here the other day; he told me Her Majesty was to be godmother to the new man-child.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William, M.P. for Carlisle, and Victor.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Vive la reine</hi></foreign> [Long live the queen]!</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>For the last week I have not known very well where you are. Jamie wrote to me from Scotsbrig that poor little Tom was very dangerously ill; and that you were to be sent for in the Gig as on Wednesday gone a week. He wrote to me afterwards the good news that Tom was much better, that you had been left to continue at Dumfries; where I will suppose you still to be. I hope you take care of yourself against this wild splashy ever-changing weather! Today and yesterday we have it very chill, frosty; oftenest it is drizzly damp, the streets all <hi rend="italic">soapy;</hi>&#x02014;a very inconstant, unpleasant sort of weather. Keep yourself warm and dry, dear Mother! Mrs Welsh writes to us that Nithsdale from her house is &#x0201C;more like sea than land&#x0201D;! She is not very well in health, and rather ill off otherwise, with a new maid, her old-established Mary having at length got her marriage with the Farmer Charles accomplished. She says that poor Mrs Glendinning (Mary Little) is very ill;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Glendinning, b. Little, wife of Robert, licensee of the Queensberry Arms, Thornhill.</note> not thought likely to recover. I am very <foreign>wae</foreign> to hear it. Alas, the distress of all kinds that pervades this country at present is frightful to think of. Comparatively are not we all right well off? Ought we not to be thankful for ourselves; to be eager to help others, so far as our ability will go?&#x02014; &#x02014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-320" n="13:320"/>My work here is of a confused and as yet <hi rend="italic">under-ground</hi> kind; like a <foreign><hi rend="italic">moudie&#x02019;s</hi></foreign> [mole&#x02019;s] work: we shall see by and by where it ever come up <hi rend="italic">above</hi> ground! Today I am off to the Museum<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >British Museum.</note> to search after certain books; I have not a moment to spare, indeed I would much rather make every moment into <hi rend="italic">two</hi> if I could: but my dear Mother must have her little word from me nevertheless. I was at the Museum yesterday too, and got the usual &#x0201C;Museum headache,&#x0201D; as I call it, to come home with; but I hope to finish off there today for a time. I keep myself as quiet as a mousing cat; avoid seeing almost all people; and get along really tolerably well. &#x0201C;Go ahead! Ahead!&#x0201D; the Yankees say!</p>

I bid them <hi rend="italic">not</hi> publish my Letter, but insert some paragraph which will put an end to the idle talk, and let all persons understand that it is nothing.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1841-12-25">25 Dec.</date>, noted TC&#x02019;s refusal in two sentences.</note> Their Professorship has <hi rend="italic">no</hi> endowment of certain funds, but depends altogether on what I myself could make of it there.

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Several weeks ago there came four copies of a new Oration of Emerson&#x02019;s one of which copies I engaged to forward to you. They have all four been circulating about, from hand to hand, towards their final destination, which they have now all except this of yours attained. This of yours was borrowed by Forster; to whom I write today, requesting him to forward it, with the present Note inclosed: that is the secret of the unknown handwriting, which might otherwise occasion you a moment&#x02019;s surprise. Take it, and be thankful.</p>
<p>I should like to know in full your deliberate opinion about Emerson:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling wrote to Emerson, <date when="1841-12-28">28 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;The Essays I have just read over again, with a new and great pleasure. &#x02026; In this last Oration there is much that I feel strongly; much, also, that makes me speculate on the kind of Church or Public that you address &#x02026; ; much, again, which does not find me,&#x02014;specially that abnegation of individualism which has become less possible for me as I have gone on in life, and which, by the way, is perhaps the most striking doctrinal difference between you and Carlyle&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence between John Sterling and Ralph Waldo Emerson</hi> [Boston and New York, <date when="1897">1897</date>] 45&#x02013;46). Caroline Fox noted in her diary, <date when="1841-06-06">6 June</date>: &#x0201C;Sterling is deep in Emerson&#x02019;s &#x02018;Essays,&#x02019; and said, &#x02018;It would answer your purpose well to devote three months entirely to the study of this one little volume; it has such a depth and originality of thought in it as will require very close and fixed attention to penetrate&#x02019;&#x0201D;; and, <date when="1841-06-08">8 June</date>: &#x0201C;J. Sterling showed me Emerson&#x02019;s book, and drew a parallel between him and Carlyle; he was the Plato, and Carlyle the Tacitus. Emerson is the systematic thinker; Carlyle has the clearer insight, and has many deeper things than Emerson&#x0201D; (Fox 128).</note> he is becoming a phenomenon worth forming a theory about. Did you ever see any numbers of that strange magazine of his called the <hi rend="italic">Dial</hi>. I have the greater part of it lying here; and could easily send it by any conveyance you saw good to appoint at any time. You will be far from <hi rend="italic">entertained</hi> in reading there: it is to me the most wearisome of readable reading; shrill, incorporeal, spirit like,&#x02014;I do not say <hi rend="italic">ghastly</hi>, for that is the character of your <hi rend="italic">Puseyism, Shelleyism</hi> &#x00026;c; real <hi rend="italic">ghosts</hi> of extinct obsolete Laudisms, Robespierrisms; to me extremely hideous at all times. This New-England business I rather liken to an <hi rend="italic">un</hi>born soul, that has yet got no body; not a pleasant neighbour either! We live in a most wondrous &#x0201C;new Era,&#x0201D; do we not?</p>
<p>Like a green islet in wide sandy wastes, these last two nights have been given to the Correspondence of Goethe and Zelter.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl Friedrich Zelter (<date when="1758">1758</date>&#x02013;<date when="1832">1832</date>), German composer; <hi rend="italic">Briefwechsel zwischen Goethe und Zelter</hi>, ed.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I make no doubt you have long since finished all you meant with Emerson&#x02019;s Oration: pray Heaven the little Pamphlet be not irretrievably absorbed in those vortices of new Literature that fluctuate round you like <hi rend="italic">clouds</hi> round the feet of Cloud-compelling Jove!

<p>For the rest if you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> find the thing, never mind; send off the Note, and Sterling will understand how things have gone, and swiftly console himself.</p>
<p>All this I have meant for the last seven days or more to come and state to you by word of mouth. But the frightful distance&#x02014;and then I have forgot your <hi rend="italic">Open Sesame</hi>, what it was; and I have been three days at the Museum, and have my &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Museum headache</hi>.&#x0201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >British Museum notes of [<date when="1841-12">mid-Dec.</date>], Forster MS f.103r. and v., show TC&#x02019;s interest in pamphlets he would have read there and that he was even thinking, &#x0201C;How would a Pamphletary History of Eng<hi rend="italic">d</hi> during the Great Civil War do?&#x0201D; This is preceded by the comment: &#x0201C;All this surely is the day of <hi rend="italic">small</hi> things: but we take it with welcome in preference to no-things.

<p>Have you noticed in the Newspapers divers paragraphs about Carlyle as connected with a certain Edinburgh Professorship now vacant? The students had got up a petition to have him elected to it, etc., etc. From which it is getting rumoured all about that he is actually a candidate. Nothing of the sort. He never for a moment has contemplated <pb id="pg-13-324" n="13:324"/>availing himself of the kind dispositions of these young gentlemen; and has answered their direct application to him on the subject with a decisive No.&#x02014; &#x0201C;They would not keep him when they had him,&#x0201D; he says (not to <hi rend="italic">them</hi> of course, but to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>), &#x0201C;and they may try whether they can catch him now.&#x0201D; Certainly the men of Edinburgh must have a tolerably high opinion of themselves to fancy he would give up his high position here for the <hi rend="italic">pleasure of teaching them!</hi> As to profit, it would be all to try for,&#x02014;this Professorship of theirs having no salary attached to it worth the name,&#x02014;some &#xa3;100 a year perhaps, with the fees that a popular Lecturer might take. But if he is to make his bread by lecturing, in an uncertain way, why not do it here, where he is already secure of an audience? or in America still better, where every one says he might make thousands of pounds in one year? No, no, we are done with Edinburgh. He owes it no gratitude for any recognition he ever found there. It is only now when London and the world have discovered his talent that they are fain to admit it. As for me, I would as soon go back to Craigenputtock as to that poor, proud, formal, &#x0201C;highly respectable&#x0201D; City.</p>

<p>My Review Article was sent me yesterday; four copies of it. I send you one, another goes to Jean, Jack has bespoken a third, and one I am to keep. You will be able to make but little of it, and indeed it is worth little either to you or to anybody: nevertheless I know you will like to have it; so here it is.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; I have not yet got any other <hi rend="italic">right</hi> writing begun; I shall have terrible boring and digging first. I must just bore away!</p>
<p>Jean I suppose would forward you the Letter I wrote; perhaps you <pb id="pg-13-325" n="13:325"/>will get it the day before this.&#x02014; I am thinking to write to Alick soon. We anxiously wait for news. <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Marshall,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your care in sending me the new <hi rend="italic">Millocrats:</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411027-TC-JGM-01">TC to JGM, <date when="1841-10-27">27 Oct.</date></ref></note> pray do not send me any more; I am sick of the unmusical braying, and must dismiss it,&#x02014;the dissonant noise in proportion to the meaning is so enormous! We are in several respects the <hi rend="italic">stupidest</hi> country in the whole civilized world at present.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1841-12-14">14 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;The mill-owners, or, as they have been not inaptly designated, the millocrats, of the midland counties assembled on Thursday last at Derby, in what is called by them a &#x02018;Great Conference,&#x02019; for the purpose of clubbing their information respecting the influence of the corn laws upon their manufactures; and after a morning consumed in detailing the sufferings of unemployed artisans these gentlemen proceeded to celebrate the public distress which had brought them together in &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">an</hi> excellent dinner provided by the landlord of the Royal Hotel.&#x02019;&#x0201D; The term &#x0201C;Millocracy&#x0201D; is used in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>.</note> Alas, we are a people all of <hi rend="italic">hearsays</hi>; there is not one man in a million that will open his eyes and <hi rend="italic">look:</hi> if men did see with eyes, how many haggard <hi rend="italic">nightmares</hi>, like to choke the life out of us, would straightway disappear, and not <hi rend="italic">be</hi>,&#x02014;as goblins and all imaginaries ought to do! Good will never come till many men be, what all men should be, men in earnest; that look with eyes instead of spectacles. It is frightful to observe, at Hustings, in Houses of Commons, in Pulpits, and indeed everywhere except in Mills and Workshops, how there is no naked-eye at all, and what sort of thing our old spectacles have now grown to be.</p>

If you have not seen them they will interest you. A passage at p. 15 (in some Quaker&#x02019;s evidence) is to me like a beam of light: if it be really <hi rend="italic">true</hi> that a man would not change his own set of workmen against another man&#x02019;s &#x0201C;for &#xa3;7,000,&#x0201D;&#x02014;then I say we have the beginning of a real Industrial <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi>hood, the sure prophecy of such!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Report &#x02026; from the Poor Law Commissioners, on the Training of Pauper Children; with Appendices</hi> (<date when="1841">1841</date>).

<p>I have got a very notable Pamphlet on Pauperism by one Geijer the most distinguished writer in Sweden at present;&#x02014;unfortunately very ill translated.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erik Gustaf Geijer (<date when="1783">1783</date>&#x02013;<date when="1847">1847</date>), historian, poet, philosopher and prof. at Uppsala, <hi rend="italic">The Poor Laws and their Bearing on Society.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Yesterday, in due Christmas order, there arrived a Box full of good things, which I saw, by the address of it, and then still better by the contents of it, had come from you. The Welsh, it is said, have warm hospitable hearts. Such testimonies that some one practically loves us are very precious. Kind thanks for your kind Christmas Gift. I am much and heartily obliged by the affection you have for me; and wonder at it somewhat now and then. Good be with you today and a merry new year, over among the Glamorgan Hills.</p>
<p>When you come to Town, fail not to shew face here. I really think it not unlikely I may try your Welsh solitudes as my place of refuge next season. I was not left alone in Scotland last year, and had pressing need to be so: it was not a satisfactory receptacle;&#x02014;alas, I know not if there is any such under this Sun; and indeed rather begin to guess, not!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-328" n="13:328"/>Meanwhile I try to get a little work out of myself, in these months, once more; an operation that requires delicacy of management! There is no other good, worth speaking of, that I have ever been able to discover in this world. Forward, therefore!</p>
<p>My Wife joins with me in kind salutations. We hope your good Mother is well, and that all goes well with you.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter reached me duly; and then, last sunday, the Swedish Book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411221-TC-JGM-01">TC to JGM, <date when="1841-12-21">21 Dec.</date></ref></note> you announced was lying here, when I came in from walking: my Wife had seen the Bringer of it,&#x02014;the Brother of the Gentleman you mentioned, not the Gentleman himself,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> who, it seems, is unwell at present: I give you, and him, and the Translator, many thanks. The latter especially you must take the trouble of making my acknowledgements to, as I know not where or who he is.</p>
<p>Tho&#x02019; somewhat busy at present, I have managed to read Geijer&#x02019;s Book. The name of the Author, which till now was but a name with me, excited expectations; and I am very glad to say they have not been disappointed. This is a man that can <hi rend="italic">think;</hi> a man with a heart and an eye; one of the rare men of our generation! I have found many deep ideas that I could agree with, more or less, in this Book. I am now about sending it off to Dr Arnold of Rugby, who also meditates on those matters. Unfortunately there does not seem the smallest chance that it can ever be extensively or almost at all read in this country, the translation is so unwieldy; what with frightful broken-backed sentences, <pb id="pg-13-329" n="13:329"/>exotic phraseology, and printing and punctuation full of errors, the reading of it is really a tough business; almost as if it had still been offered us in Norse! Genuine Swedish silver is there; but in far too rough a state for general recognisability.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; I wish somebody would translate Geijer&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">History</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably <hi rend="italic">Svenska Folkets Historia</hi>, 3 vols.

<p>I wish I had been with you at Upsala; so near the Arctic Circle, amid so many things one would like to question in a thousand ways. But I have no Fortunatus&#x02019; Hat, or Wishing Carpet, and cannot travel otherwise.</p>

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>I have read your <hi rend="italic">Coeur-de-Lion</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cantos 1 and 2 were pbd. in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x02019;s Magazine</hi> 39 (<date when="1849-02">Feb.</date>, <date when="1849-03">March</date>, <date when="1849-04">April 1849</date>) 170&#x02013;78, 277&#x02013;82, 405&#x02013;16. TC wrote of it: &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Coeur-de-Lion</hi>, a new and more elaborate attempt in the mock-heroic or comico-didactic vein, had been on hand for some time, the scope of it greatly deepening and expanding itself since it first took hold of him. &#x02026; He did not live to complete it; but some eight Cantos, three or four of which I know to possess high worth, were finished&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling, Works</hi> 11:232, 251). For further references by TC to the same poem, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:222, 249&#x02013;50, 255.</note> (Cardalion King of Urinals) with much amusement; occasionally, indeed, with loud laughter testifying the same to bystanders,&#x02014;or rather to the one by<hi rend="italic">sitter</hi>, the Sorrow of my Life here;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC.</note> to whom I had, in consequence, to read the latter half of the poem aloud! You have got a very notable facility of rhyme; there is also a right lively dancing careless kind of rhythm in this piece, which rattles along like a bundle of hardware going down stairs ever faster, <pb id="pg-13-330" n="13:330"/>in a manner comfortable to hear. True Sterlingian drollery of heart contrives to shew itself thro&#x02019; the cage-bars of those stanzas; and enamelled tints too of the higher Sterlingian qualities,&#x02014;caged as they are: alas, all ways of utterance are cage-bars, and our very <hi rend="italic">bodies</hi> in this world are cages! I find I remember the narrative with a peculiar sunny distinctness; the sign everywhere of a good delineation. Cardalion himself is a broad joyous Son of Anak;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Num. 13:33.</note> and Archbishop Joss, and brown-beautiful Budoor, and the Physic-craft of the Father of Budoor,&#x02014;they are all welcome to me, and dance as at home thro&#x02019; my head. Some of the double rhymes provoke explosions of laughter,&#x02014;partly <hi rend="italic">with</hi> them and partly alas <hi rend="italic">at</hi> them. Slim rod, Nimrod; Bishop, fish up &#x00026;c! You are a strange fellow.</p>
<p>My critical censures and proposed emendations are not many. First, were it not expedient to shorten somewhat the didactic tendencies of Aljawam, the ancient Doctor-Sheik, and explain better what he was wanting there in the desert,&#x02014;other than lecturing on Strauss <hi rend="italic">Leben Jesu</hi> and such high matters! Next, I will remark that the &#x0201C;twenty days&#x0201D; of Budoor&#x02019;s captivity had passed over me like one minute: what Richard, what the world had been doing all that while, except hunt down one unfortunate little gazelle, we do not in the least discover. A stanza or two were well worth intercalating there. Thirdly, I do vote that you get some other hest for Richard&#x02019;s riding to the hills than that mad one of hunting down the &#x0201C;onager,&#x0201D; which really was as hopeless as a Scottish &#x0201C;hunting of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">gowk</hi></foreign> [cuckoo],&#x0201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x0201C;Going on a fool&#x02019;s errand.&#x0201D;</note> and is disgraceful to Cardalion! For the rest, why were not all the English out in search of him when missing on that occasion? Fourthly&#x02014;But no, I will not add any fourthly: the thing, I tell you, made me <hi rend="italic">guffah</hi> in honest laughter; that is the sum of all criticisms that will interest you<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. TC&#x02019;s judgment in his life of Sterling: &#x0201C;Of wit, so far as rapid lively intellect produces wit, he had plenty, and did not abuse his endowment that way, being always fundamentally serious in the purport of his speech: of what we call humour, he had some, though little; nay, of real sense for the ludicrous, in any form, he had not much for a man of his vivacity; and you remarked that his laugh was limited in compass, and of a clear but not rich quality&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:127).</note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Inclosed along with this you will find an order on the Ecclefechan Post-Office for two sovereigns; which I want you to dispose of as follows. The first sovereign you are to break into two halves; and present a half-sovereign each to your little Tom<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1833">1833</date>&#x02013;<date when="1921">1921</date>), the eldest son.</note> and little Jane as a newyear&#x02019;s gift from their Uncle at London, with the strict injunction that they are &#x0201C;to be good <foreign>bairns</foreign>.&#x0201D; So much for the first. The second sovereign I want you <supplied>[to]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> take and distribute among the neediest objects in Ecclefechan, at this bitter season of the year, in this bitter time of general want, which I doubt not is felt as keenly with you as in almost any other part of the Kingdom. Poor unfortunate bodies, shivering with cold and hunger! I wish I had a hundred sovereigns to send them; but alas I have not. You are to follow your own judgement in regard to this poor <hi rend="italic">unit</hi> of a coin; and distribute it in shillings, or how you like, so as to relieve the most misery with it that you can. Every mortal who is not himself starving ought, in this time, to do what is in him for alleviating the fierce distress of his fellow creatures.</p>
<p>Today I find a very melancholy Note from Jamie. Tell him I sympathize deeply with what he and all of them are suffering; that I wait with anxiety for farther tidings about poor little suffering Tom!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He d. on the day of this letter.</note>&#x02014; Jack, who was as usual with us last night, and was speaking about the matter, shall see the Note today.</p>
<p>I am trying to be busy writing; and shall get forward, I dare say, by and by. Meanwhile it is but confused puddling work;&#x02014;a terrible cairn of stones and rubbish to sort, and see what building you can make of it! I must persist, in spite of discouragements, disappointments, difficulties never so many. Here as elsewhere a man is set down to conquer difficulties; to shovel rubbish out of his way, and pick what stones will suit him for building, and build with them!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A series of dated, or datable comments, in the Forster MS also shows how TC was struggling to find his way with Cromwell about this time or a little later: &#x0201C;Oliver Cromwell the last King (<foreign><hi rend="italic">K&#xF6;nninge</hi></foreign>) of England, may, now at this date when there is a prospect of either other kings or even of national destruction, be a figure worth dwelling on (Ah, Ah!)&#x02014;&#x0201D; (f. 95r. [<date when="1841-01">early Jan.</date>]). The next entry notes: &#x0201C;&#x02018;Commentaries of Oliver Cromwell; Studies in C.C.&#x02019; (Or what?&#x02014;&#x0201D;; and the next entry cites &#x0201C;Fraser&#x02019;s Magazine, for <date when="1841-12">Dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1841</date>.&#x0201D; The same page notes: &#x0201C;A mere sketcher shifts hither and thither round a view to catch some picturesque glimpse of it: on all sides I try C<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, but he is dull blank on all sides; only within him lies a great meaning.&#x0201D; F. 95v. notes a conversation &#x0201C;last night, <date when="1841-01-07">7 jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>,&#x0201D; at Henry Taylor&#x02019;s, and almost directly after: &#x0201C;Cromwell, at length very conceivable to me, grows even visible more and more, but invisible as if imprisoned in a globe of crystal,&#x02014;two hundred years in radius. The means of getting him out of that? Alas!&#x02014;&#x0201D; F. 93r. (the pages are not in order) [ca. <date when="1842-01">Jan. 1842</date>] heads a page &#x0201C;Studies in Oliver Cromwell,&#x0201D; as if making a new start, and ends the introductory para., &#x0201C;[Keep all that philosophy to one&#x02019;s self!].&#x0201D; Now the attempt is to visualize: &#x0201C;People I would give something to see clearly!&#x0201D; Such notes confirm that TC saw his problem as one of finding the right form, though strenuously reading to increase his knowledge.</note>&#x02014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-13-332" n="13:332"/>We know not whether you persist in your emigration scheme;&#x02014;or perhaps you keep it lying <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, not speaking of it to anybody till it come to more ripeness either for Yes or No?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was to go in <date when="1843-06">June 1843</date>.</note> My dear Brother, may a good Guidance assist and direct you! That is all I can say. A man&#x02019;s life, more especially in such days as ours, is beset with impediments, confusions, sins and miseries: it behoves him now if ever to stand up to it like a man. Not with mad violence, which will profit nothing, but with sober valour and determination,&#x02014;with patience, humility, in which alone will true <hi rend="italic">light</hi> arise for him.&#x02014; It is thought the Government have a scheme of emigration: but without removal of the Corn-Laws it will not be supported well.&#x02014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother. Jane is well, and salutes you all. Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Sir&#x02014;</salute> &#x02026; Emerson&#x02019;s people publish quarterly a kind of Magazine or Review called the <hi rend="italic">Dial</hi> (about the size of our monthly Magazines), at Boston; in almost every Number of which there is something of Emerson&#x02019;s, tho&#x02019; without his express signature: he does not write anywhere else; nor has he yet published much of moment there. The whole Periodical, however, is in some sort an emanation of him. It is edited, I believe, by a Miss Margaret Fuller,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Margaret Fuller (<date when="1810">1810</date>&#x02013;<date when="1850">50</date>), American critic and social reformer, with Emerson and George Ripley ed. <hi rend="italic">The Dial</hi> (Boston), <date when="1840">1840</date>&#x02013;<date when="1842">42</date>. On a visit to Italy she m., <date when="1847">1847</date>, the Marchese Angelo Ossoli. She was lost, with husband and child, in a shipwreck off Fire Island, N.Y., <date when="1850-07-19">19 July 1850</date>.</note> a disciple of his and of others, who goes into very high flights about Art, Self-sacrifice, Progress, etc., etc.: it is all of a very ghostly (not <hi rend="italic">ghastly</hi>) character, and cannot one would think have many readers,&#x02014;though <pb id="pg-13-333" n="13:333"/>some it has and ought to have. The London Publisher of it is, &#x0201C;John Green, 121 Newgate Street&#x0201D;; with whom I daresay any of your Manchester Booksellers could communicate.</p>
<p>You will surely do well to throw some light on that obscure and important question, The condition of the working-man in past epochs; not only what money-salary he got, and what he could buy with that, but (so far as possible) how he stood related to his employer, what constancy of occupation there was for him, etc., etc. I often say, Till the Employer and the Employed get some new <hi rend="italic">humane</hi> relation, different from a mere <hi rend="italic">Mammonish</hi> fatal relation, established between them, nothing but confused misery can await both; and all this of &#x0201C;Supply and Demand,&#x0201D; and so much else, is true only for the time being and in a very limited sense. &#x02026;</p>
