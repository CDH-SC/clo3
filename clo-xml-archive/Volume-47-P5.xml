<p>The letters in this volume cover <date when="1870-05">May 1870</date> through <date when="1871-09">September 1871</date>; the volume includes 122 letters by Thomas Carlyle and his <date when="1871">1871</date> Will; many of these letters were dictated to his niece Mary Aitken, due to the developing weakness and palsy of TC&#x2019;s writing hand. By <date when="1870-05">May 1870</date> his control of his right hand had deteriorated to such a degree that he could no longer write with a pen. Disability forced a change in writing practice: TC would dictate to Mary Aitken, occasionally correcting minor transcription errors, and usually signing the letter in his own hand. Those letters written in TC&#x2019;s own hand were written mostly in blue pencil rather than pen. The volume also includes 9 letters written by Mary Aitken at TC&#x2019;s request.</p>
 <p>During this period TC was engaged in two endeavors: work towards the Chapman &#x00026; Hall Library and People&#x2019;s editions of his collected works, and a statement of his views on the Franco-Prussian War, published as a letter in the London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on <date when="1870-11-18">18 November 1870</date>. In <date when="1871-06">June 1871</date> he also gave James Anthony Froude the manuscript of <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> and the edited collection of Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x2019;s letters that TC had worked on for several years after JWC&#x2019;s death (see vols. 43&#x02013;46). He had already written an interim <ref target="volume-47/ed-47-will-of-TC">Will on <date when="1871-04-06">6 April 1871</date></ref><!-- (included in this volume) -->, concerning the publication of JWC&#x2019;s letters and memorials, articulating his trust in Froude: &#x0201C;I solemnly request of him to do his best and wisest in the matter, as I feel assured he will.&#x0201D; Shortly after he handed over the manuscripts, TC recorded a brief statement of gratitude: &#x0201C;The deepest thanks of my heart are due to you in regard to that MS&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18710707-TC-JAF-01">TC to JAF, <date when="1871-07-07">7 July 1871</date></ref>). Froude considered them over the summer and concluded that the letters and the memoir should be published. They were then shown to John Forster, who told Froude he would advise TC that trouble might arise if TC&#x2019;s instructions for Froude were not stated clearly in his will (see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710926-TC-JAF-01"><sic>227&#x02013;28</sic><corr>TC to JAF, <date when="1871-09-26">26 Sept. 1871</date></corr></ref>, and Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:408&#x02013;15). These papers did prove controversial when they were published soon after TC&#x2019;s death (see <ref target="volume-47/ed-47-will-of-TC"><!-- 184 -->TC&#x2019;s Will</ref>), partly because of the ambiguity of TC&#x2019;s expression of his wishes, but also because of the public exposure of TC and JWC&#x2019;s relationship and their characters.</p>
 <p>The period covered by this volume could not be called unproductive, but TC was deeply affected by the barrier his manual disability placed between his thoughts and the blank page; as he was no longer able to write with ease, TC began to think of himself as unable to work. Insomnia, loss of motivation, and dyspepsia exacerbated the problem. He also blamed his debility on, variously: railway whistles, the state of modern manufacturing, tradespeople, the <pb id="pg-47-xiv" n="47:xiv"/>weather, flatulence remedies, and specific foods (for example, mutton and grouse). Diverse tonics were suggested and tried, including riding, boat trips, and seclusion in the Highlands of Scotland. TC sometimes seemed reconciled to a less productive life but often castigated himself, as in a journal entry written after a three-month visit to Dumfries, when he complained: &#x0201C;Not a word written <hi rend="italic">here</hi> or elsewhere barely; a three months shamefully empty; I think the <hi rend="italic">idlest</hi>, and among the heaviest and silently meanest of all my life&#x0201D; (TC&#x2019;s journal, see <date when="1870-09-20">20 Sept. 1870</date>; privately owned; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700920-TC-MDU-01">TC to MDU, 20 Sept. 1870</ref><!-- 651 corr = 64-65 -->). To correspondents, however, he continued to prescribe the imperative to work as the supreme duty and best comfort in life. TC&#x2019;s expressions of condolence to Meta Wellmer after the death of her mother combine sympathy with the exhortation &#x0201C;not to sit down in indolent despair&#x0201D;; TC reminded her of her &#x0201C;duty and obligation&#x0201D; to work: &#x0201C;This is a truth that I tell you not an idle figure of speech; and in fact it is the sum of all the advice and encouragement I have to give&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18711207-TC-MEW-01">TC to MEW, <date when="1871-12-07">7 Dec. 1871</date></ref>). He resolved to escape from &#x0201C;basely quiescent torpor&#x0201D; (TC&#x2019;s journal, <date when="1870-09-08">8 Sept. 1870</date>; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700906-TC-DMA-01">TC to DMA, [<date when="1870-09-06">6 Sept. 1870</date>]</ref><!-- 56 -->) and follow his own advice by writing by dictation: &#x0201C;I am much ashamed of myself. <hi rend="italic">Can</hi> I &#x2018;turn over a new leaf&#x2019;? Try it, try it ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, in the vacancy of Chelsea. If a man had but an hour to live, he o<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to employ that hour in some wise way,&#x02014;in some <hi rend="italic">wiser</hi> than this! To &#x2018;write by dictact<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> I learn that, then? Shame on me, shame!&#x0201D; (TC&#x2019;s journal, <date when="1870-09-10">10 Sept. 1870</date>; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700909-TC-FC-01">TC to FC, <date when="1870-09-09">9 Sept. 1870</date></ref><!-- 63 -->). The letters in this volume demonstrate that TC made considerable use of Mary Aitken as his amanuensis in order to keep up with correspondence, but he was never completely reconciled to this new method of composition. The loss of the use of his hand, he complained, &#x0201C;completely disfurnishes my life; makes real &#x2018;employ<hi rend="italic">t</hi>&#x2019; impossible in it&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18710515-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1871-05-15">15 May 1871</date></ref>). Ideas for subjects for essays punctuate his letters and journal entries, but the strength to research and compose was wanting. Yet intervals of activity could produce new compositions, some of a kind that TC found meaningful.</p>
 <p>TC&#x2019;s work was enabled by his niece, Mary Aitken, who, in addition to her labor as amanuensis, managed the household, organized TC&#x2019;s travel, met with visitors in his absence, and cared for TC when he was sleeping particularly badly. After one bad night, Mary was &#x0201C;up three times in the hollow of the night ministering to me like a beneficent little Fairy&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18710325-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1871-03-25">25 March 1871</date></ref>). In <date when="1871-01">January 1871,</date> Mary Aitken took over responsibility for organizing a petition to William Gladstone to award a pension to Geraldine Jewsbury, whose health and sight were failing; when the petition was rejected, Mary Aitken enlisted Margaret Oliphant&#x2019;s support in an attempt to persuade Queen Victoria to consider Jewsbury&#x2019;s case. Mary Aitken was, by TC&#x2019;s account, an excellent amanuensis, but TC found the method of dictation interrupted the fluent expression of his ideas, and he was not satisfied that the text that was produced was of the same standard as that which he could produce with his own hand. To his sister Jean Carlyle Aitken, he apologized for his unusual verbosity, <pb id="pg-47-xv" n="47:xv"/>blaming the change of style on the method of composition: &#x0201C;excuse this long <hi rend="italic">clish maclaver</hi>, which is due purely to the vice of dictating; had my own right hand been still mine I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have written in 5 lines what here occupies as many pages&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18710617-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1871-06-17">17 June 1871</date></ref>). With Mary Aitken&#x2019;s help, TC was able to remain in regular contact with his family in Scotland and in Canada: the letters in this volume record the customary exchanges of clothes, books, periodicals, medical recommendations, family news, holiday arrangements, and plans for extended visits. Mary Aitken&#x2019;s assistance as researcher and amanuensis was also essential for TC&#x2019;s letter on the Franco-Prussian War to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and the new editions of his collected works.</p>
 <p>TC was often irascible in his correspondence with Chapman &#x00026; Hall, the publishers of the Library and People&#x2019;s editions of his works, complaining of inaccuracies and failures to dispatch volumes to friends such as Ralph Waldo Emerson. Editorial work for the publishers consumed a significant portion of TC&#x2019;s time and energy, requiring him to work swiftly without sacrificing attention to detail. According to his brother John A. Carlyle, TC confined himself to correcting proofs, &#x0201C;making no alterations at all, only rectifying errors&#x0201D; (JAC to Charles Butler, <date when="1871-05-20">20 May 1871</date>; MS: EUL; pbd: <hi rend="italic">CSA</hi> 25:208). This assessment minimizes the labor involved in identifying mistakes and overseeing their correction. A letter to Frederick Anderson, the engraver tasked with preparing a woodcut of Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s portrait, is indicative of the intensity with which TC worked; TC&#x2019;s tone is urgent, conveying the pressure of deadlines and importance of attaining historical accuracy, even in a matter as small as the location of Cromwell&#x2019;s wart, to which he devotes three paragraphs: &#x0201C;For Heaven&#x2019;s sake, <hi rend="italic">put</hi> that wart right at last; and let me see a final Proof, <hi rend="italic">as soon</hi> as possible, for the Printer is getting impat<hi rend="italic">t</hi> now&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18700502-TC-FA-01">TC to FA, [<date when="1870-05-02">2</date> or <date when="1870-05-09">9 May 1870</date>]</ref>). Despite his continued dedication to the editions, he dismissed his contribution as &#x0201C;paltry bother&#x0201D; for a mere commercial enterprise (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18710604-TC-RWE-01">TC to R.W. Emerson, <date when="1871-06-04">4 June 1871</date></ref>).</p>
 <p>TC expressed greater enthusiasm for the original work he composed with the aid of Mary Aitken, his letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on the Franco-Prussian War. The version of the letter reproduced in this volume is that which was published by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18701111-TC-EOT-01">TC to editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1870-11-11">11 Nov. 1870</date></ref>). TC followed the progress of the war with growing elation, in hope and then certainty that Germany&#x2019;s conquest of France marked the beginning of her European ascendancy: &#x0201C;Germany <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be President of Europe,&#x0201D; he declared, and would be for &#x0201C;another 5 centuries or so&#x0201D;; he also recognized that the annexation of Alsace and Lorraine would prove critical, predicting that Germany would seize &#x0201C;what of Lorraine and Elsass is still German or can be expected to <hi rend="italic">re-become</hi> such&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18700907-TC-JAF-01">TC to JAF, <date when="1870-09-07">7 Sept. 1870</date></ref>). TC invested Germany&#x2019;s humiliation of France with geopolitical, moral, and cosmic significance: &#x0201C;magnanimous, pious, strong, and modest Germany is henceforth to be Queen of the Continent, <pb id="pg-47-xvi" n="47:xvi"/>instead of vain, vapouring, impious and mischievous France; which I take to be the most blessed event in European politics I have witnessed in my time&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18701020-TC-CAW-01">TC to CAW, <date when="1870-10-20">20 Oct. 1870</date></ref>). He shared his enthusiasm for the German cause, which he claimed was the view of &#x0201C;all the intelligent in England,&#x0201D; with his friend Thomas Wilson, who had long been living in Weimar (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18701003-TC-TWI-01">TC to <!-- TW mid-Oct. -->[TWI], early <date when="1870-10">Oct. 1870</date></ref>). Wilson passed TC&#x2019;s letter to the <hi rend="italic">Weimar Gazette</hi>, and TC&#x2019;s note of &#x0201C;satisfaction&#x0201D; was duly reproduced in that newspaper and thereafter in British newspapers. TC&#x2019;s partisan enthusiasm for Germany&#x2019;s annexation of French territory was not in fact representative of a consensus of the English intelligentsia. Notably TC found himself at odds with John Ruskin&#x2019;s argument, published in the second of two letters to the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> of <date when="1870-10-07">7</date> and <date when="1870-10-08">8 October 1870</date>, that Germany should give &#x0201C;unconditional armistice, and offer terms that France can accept with honour&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18701010-TC-JRU-01">TC to <!-- JR -->JRU, <date when="1870-10-10">10 Oct. 1870</date>, n.6</ref>). Foreign correspondents and war artists working for British newspapers sent regular dispatches from France by telegraph and from besieged Paris by hot-air balloon, providing eyewitness accounts of military maneuvers and the lived experience of soldiers and non-combatants.<note>1. See, for example, Henry Vizetelly, <hi rend="italic">Glances Back through Seventy Years: Autobiographical and Other Reminiscences</hi> (London, <date when="1893">1893</date>) 2:424&#x02013;26, and R. J. Wilkinson-Latham, <hi rend="italic">From Our Special Correspondent: Victorian War Correspondents and their Campaigns</hi> (London, <date when="1979">1979</date>) 102&#x02013;13.</note> TC had been growing increasingly frustrated with English &#x0201C;maudlin wail about the Woes of France&#x0201D;; were it not for his hand, he would &#x0201C;write something on that monstrous ignorance of the English Nation about European History and the nature of Facts in this world&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18701102-TC-JF-01">TC to <!-- JAF -->JF, <date when="1870-11-02">2 Nov. 1870</date></ref>).</p>
<p>TC resolved to publish on the historical background of French-German conflict with Mary Aitken&#x2019;s assistance. Researching and writing the 3,770-word letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> occupied a &#x0201C;terrible ten days&#x0201D;: &#x0201C;Poor Mary had endless patience, endless assiduity, wrote like a little fairy, sharp as a needle, &#x00026; all that could be expected of her, when it came to writing; and before that, there was such hauling down of old forgotten books, <hi rend="italic">K&#x000F6;hlers</hi>, <hi rend="italic">B&#x000FC;schings Reichshistories</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Biographies</hi> &#x00026;c &#x00026;c, in all which my little Helpmate was nimble and unwearied&#x0201D; (TC to JAC, <date when="1870-11-12">12 Nov. 1870</date>). TC&#x2019;s letter appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on <date when="1870-11-18">18 November 1870</date>. Although it is typical of Carlyle&#x2019;s work in its distinctive style and historical detail, it is a markedly partisan misinterpretation of the historical record. It echoes Otto von Bismarck&#x2019;s notorious public statement of the objects of the Franco-Prussian war; in remarks that were reported in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> on <date when="1870-09-20">20 September 1870</date>, Bismarck depicted the war as the twenty-fifth dispute between France and Germany in a century, in each of which France had been the aggressor, acting on &#x0201C;some pretext or another.&#x0201D; Bismarck represented Germany&#x2019;s annexation of Strasbourg and Metz as an act of self-defense <pb id="pg-47-xvii" n="47:xvii"/>intended only to establish an &#x0201C;improved frontier&#x0201D; and render France &#x0201C;harmless&#x0201D;: &#x0201C;We do not want the territory as territory, but as a <hi rend="italic">glacis</hi> between her and us.&#x0201D;<note>2. &#x0201C;A Conversation with Count Bismarck,&#x0201D;rdquo; <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>, <date when="1870-09-20">20 Sept. 1870</date>.</note> TC extended Bismarck&#x2019;s analysis further back into the past, manipulating four hundred years of European conflicts into a simple and misleading story in which France was the eternal, irrational aggressor, and Germany&#x02014;before she existed as a nation state&#x02014;the perpetual victim. Viewing a long history of power struggles between distinct semi-autonomous regions, duchies, electorates, and city-states in terms of the contemporary conflict between modern states was an obvious distortion of history. Although the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> published TC&#x2019;s letter, it expressed strong reservations in a lengthy editorial statement printed alongside TC&#x2019;s piece (<date when="1870-11-18">18 Nov. 1870</date>). Affirming the importance of TC&#x2019;s past work, it warned its readers to approach his letter with &#x0201C;an intelligent independence,&#x0201D; questioning the letter&#x2019;s conclusions and even &#x0201C;the method of its reasoning.&#x0201D; The editorial disputed &#x0201C;the pertinency and value&#x0201D; of references to sixteenth-century conflicts to present-day dilemmas, and deplored TC&#x2019;s failure to consider &#x0201C;the relative worth of facts and of arguments.&#x0201D; Recalling TC&#x2019;s challenge to pedantry in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>, &#x0201C;dry rubbish shot here!&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 10:49), the editorial wondered: &#x0201C;Has he forgotten his own warning?&#x0201D; TC&#x2019;s tendency to anthropomorphize France and malign her as an unpleasant personality was also noted with concern: &#x0201C;&#x2018;Franco&#x2019; is not a terrestrial being,&#x0201D; the editorial reminded its readers, and highlighted the danger of treating that mythic personality&#x2019;s &#x0201C;provinces as chattels and their inhabitants as vermin.&#x0201D; TC&#x2019;s antipathy towards &#x0201C;Franco&#x0201D; enabled him to overlook and minimize the effect of the annexation of French territory on her inhabitants. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> presented TC&#x2019;s letter as not only inaccurate, but even unethical historiography.</p>
 <p>A preoccupation in TC&#x2019;s writing at this time in his letters is the issue of colonization. Where English-speaking migrants are praised and promoted, the indigenous inhabitants of lands settled by the migrants are minimized or absent entirely from TC&#x2019;s letters promoting state-sponsored emigration to British colonies. TC had expressed interest in emigration schemes since early <date when="1870">1870</date>: he praised Arthur Helps&#x2019;s depiction of the subject in his novel <hi rend="italic">Casimir Maremma</hi> (see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700308-TC-AH-01"><sic>46:170</sic><corr>TC to AH, <date when="1870-03-08">8 March 1870</date></corr></ref>), and he supported Sir George Grey&#x2019;s political campaign for imperial expansion and emigration (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18700315-TC-JAC-01"><sic>46:173</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-03-15">15 March 1870</date></corr></ref>; <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700325-TC-LG-01"><sic>179&#x02013;80</sic><corr>TC to LG, <date when="1870-03-25">25 March 1870</date></corr></ref>; <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700329-MAI-LG-01"><sic>184</sic><corr>MAI to LG, <date when="1870-03-29">29 March 1870</date></corr></ref>; <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700330-TC-LG-01"><sic>185</sic><corr>TC to LG, <date when="1870-03-30">30 March 1870</date></corr></ref>; <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700401-TC-LG-01"><sic>185</sic><corr>TC to LG, <date when="1870-04-01">1 April 1870</date></corr></ref>; and <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700413-TC-JAC-01"><sic>194</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-04-13">13 April 1870</date></corr></ref>). He continued to promote Grey after the failure of Grey&#x2019;s election campaign, attempting to convince the Australian politicians Sir Henry Parkes and Charles Gavan Duffy of the necessity of increasing the scale of migration from Britain to the colonies. With British support, TC told Parkes, Australia might have &#x0201C;as many hardy English Emigrants as you could gradually make room for, to the unspeakable advantage of us and of you!&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18700921-TC-HP-01">TC to HP, <date when="1870-09-21">21 September 1870</date></ref>). <pb id="pg-47-xviii" n="47:xviii"/>TC&#x2019;s enthusiasm for Edward Jenkins&#x2019;s satirical novel <hi rend="italic">Ginx&#x2019;s Baby</hi> (<date when="1870">1870</date>) can be explained by its analysis of the root causes of and remedies for urban English poverty: surplus population, maintained by capitalists in order to keep wages down, could be alleviated by emigration to supposedly uninhabited colonies (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18700711-TC-CDB-01">TC to CDB, <date when="1870-07-11">11 July 1870</date></ref>; Jenkins 156&#x02013;57; 180&#x02013;88). TC also praised Froude for his essay in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, &#x0201C;The Colonies Once More&#x0201D; ([<date when="1870-09">Sept. 1870</date>] 269&#x02013;87) in which Froude used the Franco-Prussian War as cause to question the loyalty of the unpropertied masses in the event of a conflict in which Britain would have to fight. Froude argued that &#x0201C;the supply of human creatures is in excess of the demand as English society is now constituted&#x0201D; and called on the government to encourage the loyalty of the poor by establishing a &#x0201C;sustained and methodical emigration supported in part by the State&#x0201D; to British colonies, &#x0201C;where land is to be had for the asking&#x0201D; (Froude, &#x0201C;Colonies&#x0201D; 283, 278). TC congratulated Froude on fulfilling the writer&#x2019;s duty to the nation: &#x0201C;I can conceive no burden fitter for a writing Englishman than that of awakening this poor Country to the crisis for it which is now evidently nigh, and coming nigher every day&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18700907-TC-JAF-01">TC to JAF, <date when="1870-09-07">7 Sept. 1870</date></ref>).</p>
 <p>The effects of colonization on indigenous peoples were almost entirely absent from TC&#x2019;s writing on emigration, but an unguarded exchange with John Reuben Thompson revealed TC&#x2019;s attitude to the peoples of colonized lands, as well as underlining TC&#x2019;s continued prejudice against people of color. Thompson, an American poet and journalist who promoted the Confederate cause in Britain during the American Civil War, had sent TC a photograph of Hiram Rhodes Revels, the first African-American U.S. Senator. In his letter of thanks, TC commented negatively on Revels&#x2019;s physical appearance, denigrating both his African and rumored Native American ancestry: &#x0201C;I yesterday received the announced Senatorial Nigger in the highest state of preservation, a very ugly figure indeed. He seems to have something of the wild Indian as well as of the d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> [ditto] African; but no doubt knows on which side his bread is buttered; let us hope he may throw some light into the Senate of Mississippi&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18700922-TC-JRT-01">TC to JRT, <date when="1870-09-22">22 Sept. 1870</date></ref>). This is as far as TC&#x2019;s sympathy for colonized and enslaved people extends; in TC&#x2019;s racist analysis, Revels shows himself capable of suppressing the supposed &#x0201C;wildness&#x0201D; of his Native American and African heritage in order to pursue a more profitable career in politics. Furthermore, TC told Thompson, he found Revels&#x2019;s image repulsive. He concluded: &#x0201C;To me he is so ugly that I have at once got him provided for in a safe Apartment where he will be seen only by the indifferent, or the well-affected.&#x0201D; Revels&#x2019;s image was not entered in the later volumes of the Thomas Carlyle Photograph Albums; a contemporary photograph of the Senator is included in this volume (see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700922-TC-JRT-01"><sic>69</sic><corr>TC to JRT, <date when="1870-09-22">22 Sept. 1870</date></corr></ref>).</p>
<p>TC continued to be reluctant to make public statements on the issues of the day. With the notable exception of the Franco-Prussian War letter, TC seemed <pb id="pg-47-xix" n="47:xix"/>content with his absence from public life, expressing his views in private letters as he always had. Like his letters on emigration, TC&#x2019;s position on what he called &#x0201C;Female Emancipation&#x0201D; was not intended for wider circulation. In early <date when="1871">1871</date>, a series of public meetings were held in Edinburgh to debate the question of whether to allow women medical students to obtain clinical experience at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, which was a requirement of the University of Edinburgh&#x2019;s medical degree. This was the latest skirmish in the ongoing battle of the &#x0201C;Edinburgh Seven&#x0201D; (the pioneering women medical students led by Sophia Jex-Blake) to obtain qualifying medical degrees from the university. Following the &#x0201C;Surgeon&#x2019;s Hall Riot&#x0201D; of <date when="1870-11-18">18 November 1870</date>, in which the women were abused by a mob when they entered the Hall to sit an extramural examination, and a live sheep was thrust into their lecture hall in an attempt to disrupt their exam, their supporters were attempting to organize and mobilize allies to challenge their opponents at the university. A Committee for Securing Complete Medical Education to Women in Edinburgh was formed in <date when="1871-01">January 1871</date> and began to recruit supporters nationally.<note>3. Sophia Jex-Blake, <hi rend="italic">Medical Women</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1872">1872</date>).</note> Notable members of the committee included Frances Power Cobbe, Charles Darwin and Harriet Martineau.<note>4. Shirley Roberts, <hi rend="italic">Sophia Jex-Blake: A Woman Pioneer in Nineteenth-Century Medical Reform</hi> (<date when="1993">1993</date>) 101&#x02013;8.</note> As a former Rector of the University, TC&#x2019;s open support for or membership of the Committee might have helped to undermine the administrative maneuverings against the students by members of the university&#x2019;s professoriate. TC&#x2019;s friend David Masson, Chair of Rhetoric and English Literature at the University of Edinburgh, was an effective advocate for the Edinburgh Seven within the university (Jex-Blake; Roberts). John A. Carlyle was to send TC a copy of Masson&#x2019;s letter to the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> in support of women&#x2019;s access to university education (see JAC to TC, <date when="1871-12-25">25 Dec. 1871</date> [vol. 48];); he had also met and liked Sophia Jex-Blake (see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710209-TC-RLA-01">TC to <!-- RL -->RLA, <date when="1871-02-09">9 Feb. 1871</date></ref>).</p>
<p>On <date when="1871-02-09">9 February 1871</date>, TC wrote to Robert Lawson, an Edinburgh graduate, to express qualified support for women&#x2019;s entry to the medical profession, but in cautious terms that made no direct reference to the specific issue of the moment, access to the Royal Infirmary. He expressed great reluctance to touch the &#x0201C;subject of Female Emancipation,&#x0201D; which he regarded as &#x0201C;one of the most afflicting proofs of the miserable Anarchy that prevails in human society,&#x0201D; and insisted on the &#x0201C;strict condition that whatever I say shall be private.&#x0201D; TC prefaced his defense of women&#x2019;s fitness for entry to medicine by affirming that &#x0201C;the true and noble function of a woman in this world was, is, and forever will be, that of being Wife and Helpmate to a worthy Man &#x00026; discharging well the duties that devolve on her in consequence as mother of children, and mistress of a Household.&#x0201D; But &#x0201C;if a Woman miss this destiny, or have <pb id="pg-47-xx" n="47:xx"/>renounced it, she has every right, before God and man, to take up whatever honest employment she can find open to her in the world.&#x0201D; &#x0201C;<supplied>[P]</supplied>rinting, tailoring, weaving, clerking&#x0201D; were likely to be suitable fields for women&#x2019;s work; so too medicine, which had until the recent professionalization of medicine, TC argued, been the province of women. He concluded that women had a right to study medicine, and &#x0201C;it might be profitable and serviceable to have facilities, or at least possibilities offered them for so doing.&#x0201D; This statement sets TC against the most hardline opponents to women&#x2019;s medical education in Edinburgh. But TC&#x2019;s conclusion was less helpful to the women&#x2019;s cause: it seemed &#x0201C;obvious&#x0201D; to TC that women students should have &#x0201C;Female Teachers, or else an extremely select kind of Men&#x0201D;; TC may not have been aware that male lecturers were already instructing the Edinburgh Seven, albeit outside of the university. Furthermore, the notion that women might attend the same classes as men was &#x0201C;an incongruity of the first magnitude and shocking to think of to every pure and modest mind.&#x0201D; Although women had first matriculated at the university in <date when="1869">1869</date>, they were not permitted to attend mixed-sex classes within the university. They obtained instruction in extramural courses with male students, or, within the university, in small single-sex classes; because there were so few of them, they were required to pay higher fees than male students in order to make up the lecturer&#x2019;s salary (see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710209-TC-RLA-01"><corr>TC to <!-- RL -->RLA, <date when="1871-02-09">9 Feb. 1871</date></corr></ref>). TC&#x2019;s prim affirmation of the importance of modesty in pedagogy would have been a useful statement of principle to the women&#x2019;s opponents, had it been made public. Lawson respected TC&#x2019;s request for privacy, and the letter was not published until <date when="1907">1907</date>, after Lawson&#x2019;s death.</p>
<p>The period of TC&#x2019;s life covered in this volume is characterized by a declining power and interest in influencing public affairs. Running through the letters is a sense that TC&#x2019;s life&#x2019;s work is done and that he feels his end approaching, a feeling that was reinforced by the failing health of John Forster and the deaths of close friends and family, including his nephew James Aitken (Mary Aitken&#x2019;s brother), Charles Dickens, Anthony Sterling, and Thomas Spedding. TC wrote to Spedding&#x2019;s brother James: &#x0201C;We shall all soon follow Him, especially I soon must into that undiscovered country from which there is no return. &#x02026; Telos, Telos! Our thoughts on it ought rather to be silent; but may well be sad solemn &#x00026; even devout&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-47/lt-18701127-TC-JS-01">TC to JS, <date when="1870-11-27">27 Nov. 1870</date></ref>). The end of life and work was years away, but in this volume we see TC adjusting&#x02014;sometimes with difficulty, sometimes with philosophical acceptance&#x02014;to a life of retirement and rest.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1870-05">May</date></hi>. TC writes to his nephew Thomas Carlyle in Canada to send good wishes to him and to his niece Jane (to whom he intends making a cash gift). He would gladly help both Thomas and his brother John in Canada with books or cash (<date when="1870-05-04">4</date>). He thanks his brother John A. Carlyle for news of Craigenputtoch and suggests other family matters where he could help. James Anthony Froude visits (<date when="1870-05-10">10</date>). Illustrations for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> are still being sought. TC receives several visitors, David Masson, Alexander Bain, Froude, and William Allingham (<date when="1870-05-14">14</date>). He thanks John MacFarlane for a biography of Dr. George Lawson (<date when="1870-05-24">24</date>). TC laments his loss of the power of handwriting; he tries dictation &#x0201C;but never with any success&#x0201D; (<date when="1870-05-26">26</date>). He proposes a gift of &#x000A3;1,000 to Canada for Thomas and Jane there. TC begins to think of a summer holiday, perhaps in Colvend in Kirkcudbrightshire. He writes to Ralph Waldo Emerson to acknowledge receipt of <hi rend="italic">Solitude and Society</hi> (<date when="1870-05-31">31</date>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1870-06">June</date></hi>. TC draws back from his Colvend suggestion, but would still like a seaside holiday and asks John A. Carlyle to look around (<date when="1870-06-01">1</date>). He writes to his brother Alexander in Canada about his financial assistance to Alick&#x2019;s children Jane and Tom and sends &#x000A3;800 (having previously sent Tom &#x000A3;200): &#x0201C;My heart is with you, dear Bro<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x0201D; (<date when="1870-06-03">3</date>). He thanks James Fitzjames Stephen for his &#x0201C;interst<hi rend="italic">g</hi> entertaining letters&#x0201D; from his travels (<date when="1870-06-03">3</date>). He writes to his sister Jean Aitken in Dumfries announcing his intention of holidaying there (rather than in The Gill, with railway noises too close) (<date when="1870-06-08">8</date>). Froude leaves for Ireland (<date when="1870-06-09">9</date>) and invites TC to accompany him (<date when="1870-06-08">8</date>), without success. A letter from George Duncan revives good memories of Ruthwell Manse, where a young Carlyle was once well treated by the Duncans (<date when="1870-06-09">9</date>). John has reported that there are no vacancies on the Galloway coast until <date when="1870-08">August</date> at earliest, but TC wants to leave London soon. He has had visitors from India, father and son (<date when="1870-06-10">10</date>). Charles Dickens dies (<date when="1870-06-09">9</date>) and TC tells John Forster that &#x0201C;no death since <date when="1866">1866</date> has fallen on me with such a stroke&#x0201D; [<date when="1870-06-11">11</date>]. The summer heat is making him &#x0201C;very weak and miserable&#x0201D;; he has had to refuse to visit Forster who is &#x0201C;very unwell too&#x0201D; (<date when="1870-06-16">16</date>). The new edition of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> is published; TC is actively preparing to leave London for the country (<date when="1870-06-20">20</date>). He reassures Frederic Chapman (<date when="1870-06-28">28</date>) that he has no intention of changing his publishers. He congratulates William Christie on his memoir of Dryden [late <date when="1870-06">June</date>]. He leaves London for The Hill in Dumfries; after a successful railway journey, Mary Aitken reports to Lady Ashburton that they &#x0201C;have arrived all right&#x0201D; (<date when="1870-06-29">29</date>).</p>
 <p><pb id="pg-47-xxxiv" n="47:xxxiv"/><hi rend="italic"><date when="1870-07">July</date></hi>. TC writes movingly to Georgina Hogarth to thank her for a memento of Charles Dickens (<date when="1870-07-04">4</date>). He declines an invitation from Sir John Naesmyth (<date when="1870-07-04">4</date>). Lord Lothian dies (<date when="1870-07-04">4</date>) and TC writes to Lord Ralph Kerr to thank him for his letter (<date when="1870-07-10">10</date>). He thanks Caroline Davenport Bromley for a &#x0201C;condition-of-England&#x0201D; novel. He sends a gift to Betty Braid to remember JWC&#x2019;s birthday (<date when="1870-07-13">13</date>). He writes to Forster from Craigenputtoch where he spends five days, with hopes that Forster&#x2019;s eye problems are improving (<date when="1870-07-22">22</date>). TC writes to Frederic Chapman about an incorrect reference in <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, about his accounts, and about Charles Robson&#x2019;s financial problems and the security of TC&#x2019;s stereotype plates (<date when="1870-07-31">31</date>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1870-08">August</date></hi>. TC thanks the Rev. Wallace for a sermon (<date when="1870-08-01">1</date>); he tells John he is &#x0201C;leading the idlest, most useless existence &#x02026; <hi rend="italic">do</hi> nothing but lazy dull reading, a little daily walking&#x0201D; (<date when="1870-08-05">5</date>). He tells Froude he will stay in Scotland until rain cools the summer heat in London (<date when="1870-08-14">14</date>); he writes to Forster, who is clearing up Dickens&#x2019;s affairs (<date when="1870-08-26">26</date>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1870-09">September</date></hi>. TC travels to Edinburgh (<date when="1870-09-02">2</date>&#x02013;<date when="1870-09-04">4</date>), staying with the Massons, and visits Haddington (<date when="1870-09-03">3</date>) and Betty Braid (<date when="1870-09-04">4</date>), then returns to Dumfries. He writes to Froude congratulating him on his political journalism (<date when="1870-09-07">7</date>) and to Thomas Spedding acknowledging his &#x0201C;honest old friendliness&#x0201D; (<date when="1870-09-08">8</date>). He continues to choose illustrations for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and asks Chapman to commission a photographic copy of the Frederic Watts portrait of TC. Back in London (<date when="1870-09-16">16</date>), he finds the city empty (<date when="1870-09-17">17</date>), and he thanks Margaret Duncan for her letter (<date when="1870-09-20">20</date>). He thanks Henry Parkes for a copy of his speech on Australian affairs (<date when="1870-09-21">21</date>), mentioning his own enthusiastic support to the proposals for emigration being made in Britain. He writes to Emerson to reassure him that his volumes of the new edition are in transit, but rules out any possible of visiting the United States (<date when="1870-09-28">28</date>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1870-10">October</date></hi>. TC writes to Alexander Carlyle in Canada, acknowledging letters and family news (<date when="1870-10-06">6</date>). He writes to John Ruskin (<date when="1870-10-10">10</date>) congratulating him on his letters to the press on the Franco-Prussian War. He tells John A. Carlyle that &#x0201C;Plenty of people come ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me, but few to my mind&#x0201D; (<date when="1870-10-13">13</date>). He reassures William Maccall that Chapman intends to employ him as a translator (<date when="1870-10-17">17</date>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1870-11">November</date></hi>. TC tells Forster he feels &#x0201C;heavy-laden, stupid, inarticulate, to a degree,&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;much bothered with insignificant Letters,&#x0201D; but with &#x0201C;Company enough.&#x0201D; (<date when="1870-11-02">2</date>) After a difficult week of research and dictation to Mary, TC&#x2019;s letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on the Franco-Prussian War is dispatched (<date when="1870-11-11">11</date>) and published (<date when="1870-11-18">18</date>). Mary Aitken writes to Lady Ashburton to thank her for the present of game (<date when="1870-11-19">19</date>) and tells of letters of both support and criticism that TC has had for his <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> letter; Charles Kingsley writes; TC replies with a friendly invitation to visit (<date when="1870-11-22">22</date>). Ivan Turgenev visits (<date when="1870-11-25">25</date>). TC tells John A.

TC writes (<date when="1870-11-27">27</date>) to James Spedding on the news of his brother Thomas Spedding&#x2019;s death.</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1870-12">December</date></hi>. Discussions have begun with Frederic Chapman about a popular edition of TC&#x2019;s works. TC thanks John A. Carlyle for clippings from the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> and their good journalism about the Franco-Prussian quarrel; TC continues to receive a lot of mail about his <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> letter (<date when="1870-12-03">3</date>). Discussions continue about the new edition of TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>. Though averse to all dinner invitations, TC accepts one from the duchess of Argyll (<date when="1870-12-05">5</date>). He thanks Thomas Dixon for &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">two Hindoo Pamphlets</hi>,&#x0201D; and describes British society as &#x0201C;universal downbreak into slush and mud&#x0201D; (<date when="1870-12-07">7</date>); he thanks Samuel Hall for the gift of a book (<date when="1870-12-08">8</date>) and finds the Argyll dinner (<date when="1870-12-09">9</date>) unexpectedly pleasant. He writes formally to Von Foller in Germany about British attitudes to the Franco-Prussian War (<date when="1870-12-10">10</date>). Snow alternates with warm, wet rain (<date when="1870-12-17">17</date>). He is reading Anton Schindler&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Beethoven</hi>, and re-reading Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">West-&#x000F6;estlicher Divan</hi>. His niece Mary Aitken visits friends in Regent&#x2019;s Park with the Reichenbachs for a few days. TC tells Jean Aitken that despite the cold he is venturing outdoors; on Forster&#x2019;s insistence, he and Mary will spend Christmas day dining there (<date when="1870-12-24">24</date>). He writes to Robert Waldm&#x000FC;ller in Dresden to thank him for a book (<date when="1870-12-27">27</date>); he receives a gift of three partridges (<date when="1870-12-30">30</date>). He tells his brother John that &#x0201C;there can be nothing but a struggle till this fierce weather pass&#x0201D; and sends good wishes to all the family in Scotland (<date when="1870-12-31">31</date>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1871-01">January 1871</date></hi>. TC writes to Thomas H. Huxley to try to help a candidate who has applied too late for a position (<date when="1871-01-05">5</date>). He writes John A. Carlyle (<date when="1871-01-05">5</date>), who is visiting Edinburgh. TC has many visitors, including Turgenev, Froude, Reinhold Pauli (<date when="1871-01-04">4</date>), and a weekly visit from William Allingham, &#x0201C;really worth something.&#x0201D; During the cold weather TC reads widely; he sends John pamphlets and papers. Mary Aitken has bought a good new reading lamp (<date when="1871-01-13">13</date>).

<p>In my hurry at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, I see nothing <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> in the Mask except that extraordinary posit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">wart</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, once for all, <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be put <hi rend="small-caps">where</hi> the Model gives it you,&#x02014;namely, <hi rend="italic">close</hi> above the eyebrow,&#x02014;and nowhere else, for any reason what<hi rend="italic">r</hi>!)&#x02014; In the rest of the Piece, I find nothing but success, and am well satisfied.<note n="1" noteref="2">Anderson had been approached by Thomas Woolner to do a woodcut of Cromwell&#x2019;s death mask for the library edn. of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700308-TC-FA-01"><sic>46:168&#x02013;69</sic><corr>TC to FA, <date when="1870-03-08">8 March 1870</date></corr></ref>. There had been some difficulty about the placing of Cromwell&#x2019;s wart, which TC insisted must be put in the correct position. Anderson had finished the wood cut, and an impression had been sent to TC for approval. Anderson later wrote: &#x0201C;I managed, with the kindly assistance of Mr. Woolner, to define the wart&#x2019;s position to Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s satisfaction.&#x0201D; Woolner wrote to Anderson, <date when="1870-05-17">17 May</date>: &#x0201C;I think the print much improved&#x0201D; but suggested a few further corrections.

<salute>Dear Tom,</salute>
<p>I had a Letter from you lately wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> gave me, and all y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kindred here, a great deal of satisfact<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and truly was fully of interest to us all. Indeed you have written us a good many Letters, and always (for I have read them all) <pb id="pg-47-2" n="47:2"/>in an honest, clear, affectionate &#x00026; practical form: just such Letters as one wants from dear relatives abroad;&#x02014;so that the sight of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> handwriting on an envelope is, by this time, a hopeful sign so far. Continue to send us distinct news, the more in detail the better;&#x02014;and let us all be devoutly thankful that the news you send have so often been <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, when they might so easily have been other!&#x02014; As to me, my old right hand<note n="1" noteref="6">TC&#x2019;s right hand had developed palsy in <date when="1866">1866</date>; see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660416-TC-JAC-01"><sic>43:195</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1866-04-16">16 April 1866</date></corr></ref>. He wrote in his journal, <date when="1870-05-01">1 May</date>: &#x0201C;Have been in a biliary cure of health for above 3 weeks past; and don&#x2019;t yet feel to have got &#x2018;improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi>&#x2019; by it as expected. Lamentablest of my <hi rend="italic">infirm</hi>ty the <hi rend="italic">shaking</hi> of my right-hand; condemns me as if to idleness,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is an opening of the door to all kinds of dispirit<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and weak useless misery. &#x02026; &#x2018;Trading [Reading]&#x2019; is latterly my main emply<hi rend="italic">t</hi>;&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">good</hi> for absolutely nothing!&#x0201D; (TC&#x2019;s journal; privately owned).</note> (and also my poor old heart) has grown weary of writing; and indeed, except with pencil, you see, I cannot do it:&#x02014;very perverse that my right hand has got so <hi rend="italic">shaky</hi>, while the left is still steady enough: a very great loss to me in many senses (laying me quite <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, for one thing);&#x02014;tho&#x2019; surely, were not I an <hi rend="small-caps">un</hi><hi rend="italic">th</hi>ankful creature, it is rather on the continuance of the left-hand that I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> reflect, than on the decay of the right, after so many years of heavy service!&#x02014; Meanwhile you perceive, I can still write, tho&#x2019; in a slow, obstructed, uncomfortable manner: and there is one little private point, on wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I want to quest<hi rend="italic">n</hi> you a little; you, rather than y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Father who might not feel himself so free in answering ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it. It is first and chiefly of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> sister Jane<note n="2" noteref="7">Jane Welsh Sims, Alick&#x2019;s eldest da.</note> that I wish for informat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; from whom I have had one or two pretty letters long ago; but nothing at all (I can well judge why) since the time of her troubles began. A gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> notice that now &#x00026; then, that she is well in health, and holds out valiantly, while her poor husband is fallen quite a ruin:<note n="3" noteref="8">Jane&#x2019;s husband was Robert Sims; he had epilepsy; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701231-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1870-12-31">31 Dec.</date></ref></note> this is nearly all I have,&#x02014;and more of this from you in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last Letter than from any other. On inquiry in Scotland, too, nobody can tell me what is now her Post-Office Address,<note n="4" noteref="9">Robert and Jane Sims were registered in the Canadian Census, 1871, at Burford, South Brant, Ontario.</note> or even what is her <hi rend="italic">Name</hi>.</p>
<p>The essential fact is, dear Tom, I privately intend to make her a little Gift, to satisfy many feelings in myself; and I much wish to know what<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in her situat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and ways of life w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> best enable to fix wisely the manner and amount of that. What details can be usefullest you can y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self consider and judge; all details will be welcome;&#x02014;and (observe!) you are to keep the matter in the meanwhile perfectly a secret betw<hi rend="italic">n</hi> you and me. Tell me her wedded <hi rend="italic">name</hi>; how <hi rend="italic">far</hi> her Farm (or Property) lies from you, and what it is <hi rend="italic">called</hi>; what the extent &#x00026; probably worth of it is; what children she has,<note n="5" noteref="10">They had at least two children, Alexander and Thomas.</note> and of what outlook &#x00026; character; whether you understand them &#x00026; her to be <hi rend="italic">easy</hi> as to money, or <hi rend="italic">not</hi>? &#x00026;c &#x00026;c. Tell me what<hi rend="italic">r</hi> you shall think <hi rend="italic">elucidative</hi> of the matter in hand. If <pb id="pg-47-3" n="47:3"/>I had even a good <hi rend="italic">Photo</hi>h of her, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have value:&#x02014;she must be now ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 40 years old (perhaps 39 or 38?)<note n="6" noteref="11">She was 38.</note>&#x02014;it is as an infant, as a wise little <hi rend="italic">child</hi> to whom I have given lessons in reading,<note n="7" noteref="12">TC and JWC left Scotland, <date when="1834-06">June 1834</date>, before young Jane was three, so it was probably on later visits to Dumfriesshire that he read with her; he commented, <date when="1838">1838</date>: &#x0201C;She is a clever lassie it seems with her book too&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-10/lt-18380510-TC-AC-01"><sic>10:79</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1838-05-10">10 May 1838</date></corr></ref>); Alick and his family emigrated to Canada, <date when="1843">1843</date>.</note> that I still vividly remember her. &#x0201C;Good little <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi>&#x0201D;:&#x02014;you know of <hi rend="italic">Whom</hi> she is the <hi rend="italic">Namesake</hi>; and how sad &#x00026; strange and solemnly beautiful those recollect<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> may have been to me now!&#x02014; It is probable I shall write to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Father directly after the arrival of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> report; to him (if you judge it useful) I do not forbid you speak in consultat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>): but don&#x2019;t to any other person, especially not to Jane herself. And, in gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, do y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> best for me, what you judge best!&#x02014;</p>
<p>I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> also like to hear ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Brother John, and what outlook towards settle<hi rend="italic">t</hi> he has? Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Father&#x2019;s last Letter shewed him as <hi rend="italic">carpentering</hi> for some Neighb<hi rend="italic">r</hi>;&#x02014;and certainly the <hi rend="italic">wages</hi> seemed to me to be small: but I guessed the acquisit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">talent</hi> might be import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in his contemplated way of life.<note n="8" noteref="13">Alick&#x2019;s second son, John, was working as a frame builder; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700413-TC-FA-01"><sic>46:195</sic><corr>TC to FA, <date when="1870-04-13">13 April 1870</date></corr></ref>.</note> Tell me what prospect you think he has of getting to a settle<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of his own? and whether in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> neighb<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, or farther away, perhaps in some more fertile, tho&#x2019; as yet wilder and roomier territory? Let him walk wisely; stand wisely to himself, it seems to me he has essentially nothing to fear. In that wide and free element, where Labour is the one thing wanted,&#x02014;how different from ours here where (madly and miserably) Lab<hi rend="italic">r</hi> seems the one thing not wanted; and is getting at once ever <hi rend="italic">hungrier</hi> and ever <hi rend="italic">falser</hi>, in consequence, year by year!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Finally, dear Tom, to tell me more and more ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self will always be a welcome part of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter. I cannot help you in many things; but I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> in some,&#x02014;for example, in Books; if I knew any direct road to you, or indeed, except the Post-Office, any sure road at all. Tell me what is the best way <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know. To &#x0201C;Boston Mass.,&#x0201D; probably also to New York, I find I might have means of franking Parcels now &#x00026; then: but what is <hi rend="italic">y</hi>r Conveyance <hi rend="italic">thence</hi>? Advise if you know anything <hi rend="italic">better</hi>!&#x02014; &#x02014;</p>

 has interested me not a little, bringing present to me from afar much that it is good to be remin[d]ed of; strangely awakening many thoughts, many scenes &#x00026; recollections of 40, of 60 years ago,&#x02014;all now grown very sad to me, but also very beautiful and solemn.</p>
<p>I can perfectly remember reading <hi rend="italic">Sallust</hi><note n="2" noteref="50">Gaius Sallustius Crispus (ca. <date when="86">86</date>&#x02013;ca. <date when="35">35 B.C.</date>), Roman historian; for TC&#x2019;s appreciation of him, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210225-TC-JCE-01"><sic>1:332</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1821-02-25">25 Feb. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> with the venerable Mr Johnstone<note n="3" noteref="51">Rev. John Johnstone (<date when="1730">1730</date>&#x02013;<date when="1812">1812</date>), secession minister in Ecclefechan; TC wrote about Johnstone, 1832, in his memoir of his father, James Carlyle: &#x0201C;He, in his last years, helped me well in my Latin (as he had done many); and otherwise procured me far higher benefits&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> <date when="30">30</date>).</note> in that old Manse now vanished, and how completely he made me see into every fibre and wrinkle of the meaning;&#x02014;65 years ago this was; a work of love on his part (for my Father&#x2019;s and Mother&#x2019;s sake), and to me the beginning of much benefit in the school way. Strange to reflect that D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lawson (what I did not know before) was also pupil of his; he the first<note n="4" noteref="52">Lawson was taught by Johnstone while the latter was still a student; MacFarlane wrote: &#x0201C;The late Rev. John Johnstone, of Ecclefechan, was for a time classical tutor to George Lawson; and fortunate, indeed, for the future scholar was it that such a teacher was then at West Linton. &#x02026; It is not the least creditable specimen of Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s good sense and good feeling, that he still remembers the guide and instructor of his youth. We have heard that he has oftener than once declared, &#x2018;I have seen many capped and equipped bishops, and other episcopal dignitaries; but I have never seen one who more beautifully combined in himself the Christian and the Christian gentleman than did Mr Johnstone&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">The Life and Times of George Lawson</hi> <date when="27">27</date>).</note> most probably, &#x00026; I for certain the last!&#x02014;</p>
<p>It seems to me I gather from your narrative and from his own Letters, a perfectly credible account of Dr Lawson&#x2019;s Character, course of life, and labour in the world; and the ref[l]exion rises in me that perhaps there was not in the British Island a more completely genuine, pious-minded, diligent and faithful man. Altogether original too; peculiar to Scotland, and so far as I can guess unique even there and then. England will never know him out of <pb id="pg-47-10" n="47:10"/>any Book,&#x02014;or at least it would take the genius of a Shakespeare to make him known by that method;&#x02014;but if England did, it might much and wholesomely astonish her. Seen in his intrinsic character; no simpler-minded more perfect Lover of Wisdom do I know of in that generation.</p>
<p>Professor Lawson, you may believe, was a great name in my boy circle; never spoken of but with reverence and thankfulness by those I loved best. In a dim but singularly conclusive way, I can still remember seeing him, and even hearing him preach (though of that latter, except the fact of it, I retain nothing); but of the figure, face, tone, dress I have a vivid impression (perhaps about my 12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> year <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> summer of <date when="1807">1807</date>, &#x2019;<date when="1808">8</date>): it seems to me he had even a better face than in your Frontispiece, more strength, sagacity, shrewdness, simplicity, a broader jaw, more hair of his own (I don&#x2019;t much remember any wig);<note n="5" noteref="53">The frontis. was a drawing of Lawson (apparently wearing a wig), sitting in a chair with a book open on his lap, and a signature reproduced underneath: &#x0201C;I am yours affectionately / G. Lawson.&#x0201D;</note>&#x02014;altogether a most superlative steel-grey Scottish Peasant (and Scottish<note n="6" noteref="54">TC corrected Mary&#x2019;s &#x0201C;Scotch&#x0201D; to &#x0201C;Scottish.&#x0201D;</note> Socrates of the Period) really as I now perceive, more like the Twin Brother of that Athen<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Socrates, who went about, Supreme in Athens, in wooden shoes, than any man I have ever ocularly seen.<note n="7" noteref="55">TC had been reading a memoir of Sydney Smith as well as the biography of Lawson; he was more critical of MacFarlane&#x2019;s book, writing in his journal, <date when="1870-05-01">1 May</date>: &#x0201C;Memoir of <hi rend="italic">Sydney Smith</hi>, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of <hi rend="italic">D</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Lawson</hi> the Burgher Profess<hi rend="italic">r</hi> of Divinity, my latest Books,&#x02014;what a contrast bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> these two; each of them, to me, resuscitating so many buried recollect<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>! Both ill-written, most incondite Books. Sydney rather sank in character, a Life passed in shallow haha-ing (shallowish all of it, tho&#x2019; loud and hearty), in <hi rend="italic">un</hi>heroic; perfectly faithful whiggery, terrene e[u]daimonism, e[u]pepticity &#x00026;c &#x00026;c, and very little that was bitter.&#x02014; Poor old Lawson, on the contrary, tho&#x2019; the Book on him is much the worse, has <hi rend="italic">risen</hi> with me, almost into the essentially heroic. In his own dialect, veritably (a kind of <hi rend="italic">Old-Greek</hi> Scotsman of our day; invincible, unconscious, devout,&#x02014;Old-Greek and better.

<p>Many other Figures in your narrative were by name or person familiar to my eyes or mind in that now far-off period of my life. You may believe me, I am much obliged by your bringing under my notice a Book which has had such singular interest to me, and indeed by your writing the Book itself which certainly was well worth doing.</p>

<p>With regard to that other <hi rend="italic">domestic</hi> thing,&#x02014;I have evid<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> thrown you all into quite an undue agitat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> by that cursory hint I threw out in regard to Colvend, on very <hi rend="italic">loose</hi> authority it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seem!

<p>With regard to plans for this year also, I am still in a very crude state; hardly farther than the <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> for some &#x0201C;spell of sea&#x0201D; this season, &#x00026; the tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> or semi-design that something <hi rend="italic">sh</hi>d be done by way of &#x0201C;effort&#x0201D; towards it: this is all the length I,&#x02014;poor <hi rend="italic">lazy</hi> I, not worth much trouble ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, hope of &#x2018;improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi>&#x2019; being so near zero,&#x02014;have yet gone. Add to wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">weather</hi> here is hitherto for me nearly perfect, breezy, fresh, <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> with <hi rend="italic">grey skies</hi>; so that I was not think<hi rend="italic">g</hi> to quit it for a week or two yet; sensible (as <hi rend="italic">laziness</hi> pleaded) that I really might go farther &#x00026; fare worse. This is candidly how the matter stands.</p>
<p>Do <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, therefore, my dear Br<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, run off to Whithorn, Garlieston<note n="7" noteref="88">Whithorn, village about 65 mi. (104.5 km.)

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Some time ago I wrote to Nephew Tom,<note n="1" noteref="99">See <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700504-TC-TCA-01">TC to TCA, <date when="1870-05-04">4 May</date></ref>.</note>&#x02013;as perhaps he may have told you (or perhaps <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, for I left that optional with him):&#x02014;my purpose privately was, to make some quiet inquiry after y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> good &#x0201C;Little Jane&#x0201D; and her circ<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, upon wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> trust to Tom for more precise and fine details than I yet had.

But I know well, with all y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> tolerance, friendliness, &#x00026; wealth of life, the hope is impossible; possible only for a time.

<p><salute>Dear Sir,&#x02014;</salute>You need no apology for addressing me;<note n="1" noteref="129">Duncan wrote, <date when="1870-06-04">4 June</date>: &#x0201C;I am a stranger to you, but my grandfather &#x02026; was not, and it is a good deal on that ground that I rest my plea for addressing you.&#x0201D;</note>
 your letter itself is of amiable ingenuous character; pleasant and interesting to me in no common degree. I am sorry only that I cannot set at rest, or settle into clearness, your doubts on that important subject.<note n="2" noteref="130">Duncan continued: &#x0201C;when people are perplexed or in doubt, they go to their minister for counsel: you are my minister, my only minister, my honoured and trusted teacher, and to you I, having for more than a year back ceased to believe as my fathers believed in matters of religion, and being now an inquirer in that field, come for light on the subject of prayer.&#x0201D; Duncan felt that to try and change the will of God by prayer was &#x0201C;in the last degree absurd&#x0201D;; he asked: &#x0201C;Is it too much to hope that you will kindly write me a few lines throwing light on this subject? &#x02026; Lest these remarks should seem to you intolerably shallow, I must inform you that I am only twenty.&#x0201D;</note>
 What I myself practically, in a half-articulate way, believe on it I will try to express for you.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-47-24" n="47:24"/>First, then, as to your objection of setting up <hi rend="italic">our</hi> poor wish or will in opposition to the will of the Eternal, I have not the least word to say in contradiction of it. And this seems to close, and does, in a sense though not perhaps in all senses, close the question of our prayers being <hi rend="italic">granted</hi>, or what is called &#x2018;heard&#x2019;; but that is not the whole question.</p>
<p>For, on the other hand, prayer is and remains always a native and deepest impulse of the soul of man; and correctly gone about, is of the very highest benefit (nay, one might say, indispensability) to every man aiming morally high in this world. No prayer no <hi rend="italic">religion</hi>, or at least only a <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> and lamed one! Prayer is a turning of one&#x2019;s soul, in heroic reverence, in infinite desire and <hi rend="italic">endeavour</hi>, towards the Highest, the All-Excellent, Omnipotent, Supreme. The modern Hero, therefore, ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to give up praying, as he has latterly all but done.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Words</hi> of prayer, in this epoch, I know hardly any. But the act of prayer, in great moments, I believe to be still possible; and that one should gratefully accept such moments, and count them blest, when they come if come they do&#x02014;which latter is a most rigorous preliminary question with us in all cases. &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Can</hi> I <hi rend="italic">pray</hi> in this moment!&#x2019; (much as I may <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to do so)? &#x2018;if not, then <hi rend="small-caps">no</hi>!&#x2019; I can at least stand silent, inquiring, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> blasphemously <hi rend="italic">lie</hi> in this Presence!</p>
<p>On the whole, Silence is the one safe form of prayer known to me, in this poor sordid era&#x02014;though there are ejaculatory words too which occasionally rise on one, with a felt propriety and veracity; words very welcome in such case! Prayer is the aspiration of our poor struggling heavy-laden soul towards its Eternal Father; and, with or without words, ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to become impossible, nor, I persuade myself, need it ever. Loyal sons and subjects <hi rend="italic">can</hi> approach the King&#x2019;s throne who have no &#x2018;request&#x2019; to make there, except that they may continue loyal. Cannot they?</p>
<p>This is all I can say to you, my good young friend; and even this, on my part and on yours, is perhaps too much. Silence, silence! &#x2018;The Highest cannot be spoken of in words,&#x2019; says Goethe.<note n="3" noteref="131">See Goethe, <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> 3432, and Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 370 and 462.</note>
 Nothing so desecrates mankind as their continual babbling, both about the speakable and the unspeakable, in this bad time!</p>
<p>Your grandfather was the amiablest and kindliest of men; to me pretty much a <hi rend="italic">unique</hi> in those young years, the one cultivated man whom I could feel myself permitted to call <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> as well. Never can I forget that Ruthwell Manse, and the beautiful souls (your grandmother,<note n="4" noteref="132">Agnes, b. Craig (d. <date when="1832">1832</date>), m., <date when="1803">1803</date>, Henry Duncan.</note>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x02014;</salute>I was thinking to write a word to you today; and here has y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter just come in, reinforcing my already settled purpose. For the rest I am very useless today; under a kind of biliary crisis for some three days past, involving two &#x0201C;bad nights&#x0201D; (neither of them nearly <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> sleepless, how<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and the former much the worse of the two);&#x02014;this is a thing I am evid<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> growing more liable to; but the dreadful <hi rend="italic">wake</hi>fulness with its shivering miseries, has much left me since you were last here.

<p>To yourself I believe it is perfectly well known, and you can make it known to any person interested, that I have not at present the least thought of changing my Publishing House, which has comfortably served me in that capacity for near thirty years past<note n="1" noteref="204">Chapman &#x00026; Hall pbd.

&#x02014;</p>
<p>Of course no Author can make <hi rend="italic">a marriage contract</hi> with his Publishers, or tie himself from changing whenever he finds that unpleasant step advisable: but, sure enough, the state of facts is quietly as above, at this date</p>

<salute>Dear Sir John,</salute>
<p>You are very kind and obliging; and certainly I owe you and yours many thanks for such friendly feelings. Certainly too your hospitable offer awakens in me something of hope as well as pleasure; nor will I quite give it up as <hi rend="italic">im</hi>possible! But the sad fact is, I am grown mostly as good as incapable of making visits: such incapacity of sleeping, such nicety of management in diet &#x00026;c &#x00026;c (in brief, the most dyspeptic of all my contemporaries),&#x02014;and such a horror of railwaying to begin with!&#x02014; This little place of my Sister&#x2019;s, perfect for me in all particulars (<hi rend="italic">except</hi> the unblessed railway whistle<note n="1" noteref="217">Mary Aitken wrote to Lady Ashburton, [<date when="1870-07-09">9 July</date>]: &#x0201C;He has not been sleeping at all well since he came&#x02014;the railway whistles drive him almost mad at nights; but for them he likes being here very much&#x02014;and confesses that even with his bad sleeping, he feels much better in health than he did at Chelsea&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note>
 now and then) I consider as my &#x0201C;Convalescent Hospital&#x0201D;; and here I must lie, shrunk into the uttermost attainable seclusion, the heat and broil of London, cower out of it as I might, having so ruined me of late. These are the literal facts.</p>
<p>If I do travel in Scotland, and come at all within reach of your beneficent and quiet circle,<note n="2" noteref="218">Since the address line was from Dumfries, presumably Naesmyth knew that TC was in Scotland.</note>
 I shall not need farther temptation to announce myself there. There, or when some of you perhaps visits London:&#x02014;let us still hope to make a little acquaintance by and by!</p>

<p>The news of Lord Lothian&#x2019;s death<note n="1" noteref="220">Lord Kerr wrote, [<date when="1870-07-06">6 July</date>]: &#x0201C;It is with great sorrow that I announce to you the death of my poor Brother Lothian&#x02014;after 15 years of weariness he has at length found rest.&#x0201D; Lord Lothian d. <date when="1870-07-04">4 July</date>. TC wrote on the back of his letter: &#x0201C;L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Ralph Kerr (death of L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Lothian <date when="1870-07-06">6 july 1870</date>).&#x0201D;</note>
 fell sad &#x00026; heavy news on us here the more so as it was altogether unexpected too. I had seen him at Carlton Terrace in May:<note n="2" noteref="221">There is no mention in TC&#x2019;s letters of this visit; the Lothians were staying at 4 Carlton Terr. earlier in <date when="1870">1870</date>.</note>
 found nothing changed in his fine gracefully intelligent talk &#x00026; always kindly &#x00026; perfect ways&#x02014;except, transiently once or twice, a something in the look of his eyes, which I spoke of to Froude as we came away, who then &#x00026; afterwards assured me it was nothing. Twice three times, after this, I attempted another visit, &#x00026; once has actually set out for Clapham Park<note n="3" noteref="222">Lord Lothian d. at his home in Clarence Rd., Clapham Park.</note>
 under Froude&#x2019;s Escort who had promised me there; but something peremptory turned us elsewhither that time:&#x02014;and in brief I was to behold that loved &#x00026; always beautiful &#x00026; interesting Fellow-Man no more. He honourably rests now, and all his heavy &#x00026; continual sorrows are done.&#x02014;</p>
<p>I am much obliged by this Note you have written me, I feel it an honor to have had something of friendship from so bright a spirit &#x00026; to be counted among his friends.<note n="4" noteref="223">The Carlyles were friendly with the Lothians by <date when="1862">1862</date>; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620721-JWC-LLO-01"><sic>38:120&#x02013;21</sic><corr>JWC to LLO,  [<date when="18620721">21 Aug.

 Seldom was there a more tragic destiny, a crueller shutting of the road upon a brave young Soul &#x00026; all his noble prospects &#x00026; purposes in this world, &#x00026; nobody could have borne it with a gentler finer heroism than he seemd constantly to do.<note n="5" noteref="224">Lord Lothian was an invalid for much of his life.</note></p>

 is capital in its way, and has given great satisfaction here. The writing man is rather of penny-a-liner habits and kind, but he slashes along swift and fearless, sketching at arm&#x2019;s length, as with a burnt stick on a cottage wall, and sketches and paints for us some real likeness of the sickening and indeed horrible anarchy and godless negligence and stupor that pervades British society, especially the lowest, largest, and most neglected class; no legislator, people&#x2019;s William<note n="2" noteref="230">William Gladstone.</note>

 but was met with nothing but angry howls and Radical Ha, ha&#x2019;s! And here the said question still is, untouched and ten times more unmanageable than then. Well, well! I return you Ginx, and shut up my lamentations.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x02014;</salute>I trust and hope you are recov<hi rend="italic">g</hi> rapidly from that miserable accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> shocked us all so much! it was the brutallest of events, an unmixed bit of human-diabolic ugliness on the part of that poor simple fellow-creature;&#x02014;from wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> surely the officers of the establish<hi rend="italic">t are</hi> blameable not to have secured all visitors, especially you?<note n="1" noteref="243">Forster wrote, <date when="1870-07-11">11 July</date>: &#x0201C;<supplied>[T]</supplied>he assault was made upon me, by one of a very dangerous class of men&#x02014;an insane Indian soldier whose delusion was that I had ordered his food to be poisoned. I had reason to complain of the authorities &#x00026; attendants of the Asylum&#x02014;but the terrible suddenness of the frenzy was some excuse. &#x02026;<supplied>[T]</supplied>here is now no external mark of the injury&#x0201D;; he was still suffering from &#x0201C;the sense as of a film or veil passing continually over the left eye (the opposite side to that on which the blows were struck)&#x0201D; and all his engagements had had to be abandoned. The soldier is not further identified. Forster was presumably attending the asylum as a commissioner of the Lunacy Commission.</note>
 Don&#x2019;t forgive them quite; leave them what will be a reminiscence; that is a duty you owe, to everybody, themselves included!&#x02014; For the rest, happily, I can believe in Quain&#x2019;s prognosis ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> <pb id="pg-47-45" n="47:45"/>the muscles of the eye;<note n="2" noteref="244">Dr. Richard Quain; Forster wrote: &#x0201C;Quain assures me there is no injury to the eye itself, but that it will be some weeks before the discomfort passes away.&#x0201D;</note>
 and almost hope you are already quit of that and all remains of the affair. If not yet altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, only <hi rend="italic">festina lente</hi> [make haste slowly] (mind!), and you soon will.</p>
<p>No doubt this date of place surprises you, and it even does myself. I fled up hither monday last, to escape from the railway whistles,<note n="3" noteref="245">See <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700704-TC-JMN-01">TC to Sir JMN, <date when="1870-07-04">4 July</date></ref>.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> were threaten<hi rend="italic">g</hi> at last to drive me sleepless utterly, and to become a torment unendurable. My Nephew,<note n="4" noteref="246">James Carlyle Jr.</note>
 the Tenant here, bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me up at a tearing pace thro&#x2019; the beautiful old vallies, now so <hi rend="italic">preternat</hi>l to me; landed me at the old door, 10 miles from any pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> or future railway; in the centre of the solitudes,&#x02014;a silence to soul &#x00026; to ear, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I may well liken to that of <hi rend="italic">the grave</hi>. It is in fact the <hi rend="italic">Forecourt of the Grave</hi>, this where I have been living, and thrice mournfully musing for the last four days: a scene comparable to no other under the sky; <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> to me as the Sepulchre at Jerusalem;<note n="5" noteref="247">The site of the tomb of Christ in the Old City of Jerusalem on which several churches have been built and which became an important place of Christian pilgrimage.</note>
 <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi> too as that, and with a nobleness that is eternal and belongs to Heaven. Yea, verily, <hi rend="italic">yea</hi>. And so, in this Sky-domed &#x0201C;Cathedral&#x0201D; (what is my one consolat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>) I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> a kind of <hi rend="italic">worship</hi> withal, and with my whole sad soul can ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> from the deeps. Amen, Amen.&#x02014; &#x02014; Forgive all this, dear Friend; you know it well enough with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> any telling. But I leave this tomorrow morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>; run across, 40 miles, to Annandale; &#x00026; shall not probably be here ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, or write another Letter hence. Dumfries is still the cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Address.</p>
<p>That &#x0201C;Dickens sale&#x0201D; made even the Newspapers beautiful to me, and was surely a most successful &#x00026; well-managed thing.<note n="6" noteref="248">Forster and Georgina Hogarth were the executors. The auction in London by Christie, Manson, and Wood of Dickens&#x2019;s paintings, art objects, and curiosities, <date when="1870-07-09">9 July</date>, was widely reported in the newspapers. Forster wrote, <date when="1870-07-11">11 July</date>, on its &#x0201C;success far beyond the most exaggerated expectation. I should have thought 5000&#x000A3; a fair, even a great, result: and we have obtained &#x000A3;9410&#x02013; The pictures all went for prices far beyond their value; but the other smaller things brought prices even more disproportionate; bits of china obtainable for 10s. or 20s. going for 20 and 30 guineas!&#x0201D;</note>
 May the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> at Gads Hill<note n="7" noteref="249">The second sale was of Gad&#x2019;s Hill house, <date when="1870-08-05">5 Aug.</date>, and of its remaining contents, particularly furniture, <date when="1870-08-10">10</date>&#x02013;<date when="1870-08-13">13 Aug.</date> For the sale of the house, see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700826-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1870-08-26">26 Aug.</date></ref></note> be equally so,&#x02014;for the sake of those poor bereaved ones whom it will benefit, tho&#x2019; to Him it is of no acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> thro&#x2019; all Eternity now. How strange, how sad, and full of mystery and solemnity, to think of our bright, high-gifted, ever-friendly Dickens, lying there in his silent final rest!</p>
<p>Adieu, dear Forster; let me have a word from you very soon. The good Mrs<note n="8" noteref="250">Eliza Forster.</note>

I was to join him the next week if he could sleep&#x02014;but he came back here after four days worse than ever. He said it was as bad as living in one&#x2019;s grave to attempt to live there again. He sometimes speaks of taking a house near this &#x00026; out of the reach of railway whistles where he could come &#x00026; spend every summer; but the speculations have never taken any practical form as yet. We hope he may be able however to weave the railway whistles into his dreams as he has been complaining of them much seldomer latterly. My Uncle John [A.

<salute>Dear Froude,</salute>
<p>I am glad to hear of you again; had not my <hi rend="italic">fingers</hi> been unwilling you would have heard from me before this, and more at large: these long silences are not proper, especially at this epoch, when another kind of <hi rend="italic">Silence</hi> is coming on so near!&#x02014;</p>
<p>I fled out hither, urged by little Mary, and the burning weather, in the last days of june; &#x00026; have been all but immovable ever since (all voyaging &#x0201C;to Norway&#x0201D; to &#x00026;c, impossible to one so ticklish about <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, in a world so full of uproar): and am quietly waiting till the <hi rend="italic">Lammas</hi> rains quench Chelsea into habitability again, that I may creep back to my sad old den there. I am certainly not worse in health since I left; nor am I sensibly <hi rend="italic">better</hi>,&#x02014;perhaps never shall be; oftenest don&#x2019;t much <hi rend="italic">care</hi>. My life here is encircled as if in Cotton (such the unwearied kindness and loving patience of all this Household to me); for the rest, a life utterly secluded, of silence almost complete; and outwardly as idle and as vacant as man can lead. Outwardly mere <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>, reading &#x00026;c without aim except to avoid the utterly stupid &#x00026; <hi rend="italic">un</hi>readable; tho&#x2019; inwardly, as you guess, it is perhaps full enough, or too well filled with sombre meditations, recollections, unfathomable musings on the inexorable &#x00026; inevitable. Three or four weeks ago, my Brother fled off to Gweedore, the Giants Causeway, Port Rush &#x00026;c; and has not yet returned,&#x02014;just got across to Galloway again, <pb id="pg-47-51" n="47:51"/>&#x00026; still doing some small visits there. I have a small Errand to Edinburgh for one day; another ditto to native Annandale (only 16 miles off, where I have not yet been): nothing else of travel till I return. <hi rend="italic">This</hi> (excepting railway whistles only!) is the most perfect lodging I have been able to discover in the world for myself since <date when="1866">1866</date>.&#x02014; But now for your little queries.</p>
<p>The Popular Edition<note n="1" noteref="283">Froude&#x2019;s 12 vol. <hi rend="italic">History of England</hi> was being pbd. in a &#x0201C;cabinet edn.,&#x0201D; described as a &#x0201C;cheap and small edition. Clearly printed and bound in the sober school style, they form a desirable addition to the book-shelves of those whose means will not allow the larger and more expensive edition&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1870-07-09">9 July</date>); Froude&#x2019;s U.S. publisher, Charles Scribner and Son, New York, was publishing a similarly less expensive edn., marketing it as the &#x0201C;Popular Edition of Froude&#x2019;s History of England.&#x0201D;</note>
 is welcome news to me; make it <hi rend="italic">cheap</hi> enough, it is sure of an immense public. In regard to the Freeman &#x00026; similar criticisms &#x00026; calumnies,<note n="2" noteref="284">Edward Augustus Freeman (<date when="1823">1823</date>&#x02013;<date when="1892">92</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10146"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), historian, who from <date when="1864">1864</date> onward had repeatedly criticized Froude&#x2019;s work for its alleged inaccuracies. In a two&#x02014;part review (<hi rend="italic">Saturday Review</hi>, <date when="1870-07-16">16</date> and <date when="1870-07-23">23 July</date>), Freeman assessed Froude&#x2019;s two&#x02014;part &#x0201C;Fresh Evidence About Anne Boleyn&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, June and July). In these, Froude reconsidered Anne Boleyn&#x2019;s reputation in light of his recent discovery of an archive in Vienna containing the correspondence of Eustace Chapuys; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700514-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-05-14">14 May</date></corr></ref>. Froude had been unaware of this source when he was earlier writing <hi rend="italic">History of England</hi>; it changed his previous estimatation of Anne Boleyn: &#x0201C;Chapuys&#x2019;s account, though it leaves the question of Anne&#x2019;s guilt still uncertain, yet reveals a mass of intrigue, political and personal, in Henry&#x2019;s court, which made it seem possible, for the first time to me, that the poor Queen might have been innocent, yet that the King and Parliament might have honestly believed her guilty&#x0201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:397). Henry VIII (<date when="1491">1491</date>&#x02013;<date when="1547">1547</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12955"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), king of England and Ireland. Freeman acknowledged that Froude &#x0201C;has learned something during the fourteen years which have passed since his first two volumes [of the <hi rend="italic">History of England</hi>] appeared,&#x0201D; concluding: &#x0201C;Mr. Froude deserves credit for the zeal with which he has sought out Chapuys&#x2019; evidence which goes so far to upset his own former story. He has, in short, brought the hatchet to his own argument.&#x0201D;</note>
 my impression is very clear that, beyond recognizing their existence &#x00026; their despicability, you will get no good by speaking at all. &#x0201C;The Public&#x0201D; is an idle fool, not worth appealing to to<note n="3" noteref="285">The printed text omitted the comma between &#x0201C;to&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;to.&#x0201D;</note>
 whom all &#x0201C;appeal&#x0201D; is <hi rend="italic">degrading</hi>,&#x02014;as from a Plaintiff thrice in earnest to judge full of levity and of darkness; and interested only to see a fight rise! I think I would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> repeat that Wager of Battle; or perhaps only <hi rend="italic">cite</hi> it (in the way of mockery), from the Pall Mall Gazette,<note n="4" noteref="286">Freeman wrote a scathing review of Froude&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of England</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Saturday Review</hi>, <date when="1870-02-05">5</date> and <date when="1870-02-12">12 Feb.</date>), to which Froude had responded, in a letter pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>, <date when="1870-02-15">15 Feb.</date>, issuing a challenge to the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Review</hi> [Philip Harwood (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x02013;<date when="1887">87</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12542"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>)], that he subject any pages of the work to independent expert scrutiny; it appears that nothing came of this challenge.</note>

<p><pb id="pg-47-52" n="47:52"/>As to Anne Boleyn, I find still a considerable want of perfect clearness;&#x02014;and withal that the nearest approach I made to clearness about her was in the Dialogue we had, one day <hi rend="small-caps">before</hi> <hi rend="italic">Chapuys</hi> came out. <hi rend="italic">Chapuys</hi> rather sent me to sea again, and dimmed the matter.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I am wearying very much to have a word from you ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x02014;first of all, to know to know<note n="1" noteref="293">Words repeated in MS.</note>
 certainly how both of you are. That unlucky <hi rend="italic">eyelid</hi><note n="2" noteref="294">See <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700722-TC-JF-01"><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1870-07-22">22 July</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 I always hope is doing well; but y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own word upon it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the valuable thing. Where are you, Madam &#x00026; you; how are you? Answer me all that, the more minutely <pb id="pg-47-53" n="47:53"/>the better.<note n="3" noteref="295">Forster replied, <date when="1870-08-29">29 Aug.</date>: &#x0201C;It has been a great comfort to hear from you, dear Carlyle. We are both <hi rend="italic">very grateful</hi> to you for having written.&#x0201D; He then gave TC a detailed account of his own and his wife&#x2019;s health.</note>
 Since Robson&#x2019;s miserable downbreak I have heard nothing from you;<note n="4" noteref="296">Robson&#x2019;s bankruptcy; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700731-TC-FC-01"><corr>TC to FC, <date when="1870-07-31">31 July.</date></corr></ref>; Forster replied that he had taken legal advice about TC&#x2019;s stereotype plates, and &#x0201C;there being no doubt or question in the matter at all &#x02026; I am permitting the further impressions needed to be taken for the present by Robson. The folly of the poor man &#x02026; is very sad. I know nothing yet of what the issue is to be, or whether another chance is to be afforded to him by his creditors.&#x0201D;</note>
 and various things since that have come and gone on wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am all in the dark. The sale &#x00026; settle<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> at Gad&#x2019;s Hill,<note n="5" noteref="297">See <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700722-TC-JF-01"><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1870-07-22">22 July</date></corr></ref>. Forster replied, telling TC about the sale of Dickens&#x2019;s house and estate; they were bought by Dickens&#x2019;s son Charles (<date when="1837">1837</date>&#x02013;<date when="1896">96</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7600"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), who, not realizing that the executors (of whom Forster was one) had set a reserve price, believed, &#x0201C;from the slow and comparatively small offers at first made, &#x02026; that the property was about to be sacrificed,&#x0201D; bid against them.</note>
 for example,&#x02014;this enormous War,<note n="6" noteref="298">France declared war on Prussia, <date when="1870-07-19">19 July</date>, having been maneuvered into the declaration by Bismarck, who believed a war was the best way to get the German states to unite under the Prussian king.</note>
 filling all the Newspapers to overflow, has cut me off from any details about that; ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you were so interested, and I withal. Poor loved Dickens, how sad and strange to think that we shall never see his blithe face more. One other N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of that <hi rend="italic">Edwin Drood</hi>;<note n="7" noteref="299"><hi rend="italic">The Mystery of Edwin Drood</hi> (<date when="1870">1870</date>), Dickens&#x2019;s final novel, left unfinished at his death; five instalments were pbd., <date when="1870-04">April</date>&#x02013;<date when="1870-08">Aug.</date>; the last was due <date when="1870-09">Sept. 1870</date>.</note>
 and then no more, no more forever! The figure of him, with a strange impressiveness in it, often visits me, among the Shadows of my other Loved Ones that are gone. All vanished, gone;&#x02014;yet, of a surety, all &#x0201C;with God,&#x0201D; even as we are: Silence, silence; we have no word more to say.</p>
<p>My life here is retire<hi rend="italic">t</hi> itself; nob<hi rend="italic">y</hi> can be more silent, <hi rend="italic">withdrawn</hi> altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> from the world; but, alas, dwelling mainly otherwise in the vague, in the cloudy and (to practical purposes) mournful and inane. I read 3 or 4 hours daily, goodish Books in my brother&#x2019;s Collect<hi rend="italic">n</hi> here; that is the only pleasantish or <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> part of my time,&#x02014;tho&#x2019; of what <hi rend="italic">use</hi> it is ever to be, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not the least explain to myself or another. All writing, r<hi rend="italic">t</hi> right<note n="8" noteref="300">Word in full repeated at turn of page.</note>
 hand still forbidding, is more and more a horror to me, avoided utterly except on the plainest compulsion otherwise. In all my days I have never been so idle and so lazy; no courage left in me that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> furnish out the heart of a sparrow. Is not this enough from me under the head of &#x0201C;news&#x0201D;!&#x02014; I have begun latterly to think of coming home ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; the sooner the better, now that the weather is grown cool ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>: but am too inert to form even that resolut<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x0201D;&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">proh pudor</hi> [for shame].</p>
<p>The Copper Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Emperor of the French<note n="9" noteref="301">Napoleon III, emperor of France <date when="1852">1852</date>&#x02013;<date when="1870">70</date>. &#x0201C;Copper captain&#x0201D; means someone who assumes a title without any right to it. TC had long disliked him; see, for example, 35:109 and 155, and 36:119. By mid-Aug. the French had lost several battles; they lost the biggest battle of the war, <date when="1870-08-18">18 Aug.</date>, at Gravelotte, a village in Lorraine near the French-German frontier.</note>
 has led himself a pretty dance: <pb id="pg-47-54" n="47:54"/>it is the one thing in the world Political that is not ugly to me just now. Adieu, dear F.&#x02014; <closer><salute>Y<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> ever</salute> <signed><name>T. Carlyle</name></signed></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Masson,</salute> This morning I find (a sharp shower reminding me) that the indispensable <hi rend="italic">mackintosh</hi> is still hanging amid its kindred miscellanea in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Hall!<note n="1" noteref="311">Masson replied, <date when="1870-09-07">7 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;Your mackintosh is sent off to the Railway Station, in a parcel addressed to you. It had escaped notice, till your note came this Morning.&#x0201D;</note>
 Brown-paper Parcel (unpaid) by Caledon<hi rend="italic">n</hi> railway; that is the clear remedy; one other bit of trouble I had still to add to the big kindness already accumulated <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. Nothing else of harm was in the journey yest<hi rend="italic">y</hi>; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I happily got transacted, after Abington Station,<note n="2" noteref="312">Abington station, 41 mi.

</p>
<p>Of one thing I have, and shall retain, a right glad and thankful memory, the warmly human way in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you all rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> me, and wrapt my infirmities and me in soft down, in sympathy and ministrat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of your best. Not even the railway <pb id="pg-47-56" n="47:56"/>whistles and other <hi rend="italic">infernalia</hi> of the case deprive me of that, or indeed do other than enhance all that.</p>
<p>But my journey, I find, was radically wrong-schemed. It was of the nature of a relig<hi rend="italic">s Pilgrimage</hi> (truly such to me in this now wholly irrelig<hi rend="italic">s</hi> world); I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have made direct for Hadd<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and back, communicat<hi rend="italic">g</hi> with no mortal; then w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> there have been nothing that was not sacred that was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sacred, that was mundane, basely miserable and profane.<note n="4" noteref="314">TC wrote, <date when="1870-09-08">8 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Three</hi> items of noble nature, one of them <hi rend="italic">divine</hi>; embedded wholly in an element of tempestuous contradictories, and <hi rend="italic">sordido-infernalia</hi>.

<salute>Dear Froude,</salute>
<p>Your Colonial Article came duly on the 1st of the Month;<note n="1" noteref="321">Froude&#x2019;s essay, &#x0201C;The Colonies Once More,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 82 (<date when="1870-09">Sept. 1870</date>): 269&#x02013;87, argued that because the British population was growing so fast with so many people suffering from acute poverty, everyone would benefit if the British government instituted a comprehensive policy of organized and, if necessary, subsidized emigration to its colonies; it would be better if the emigrants went to British colonies thus continuing to benefit the home country, rather than, like the majority of Irish emigrants, going to the U.S.</note> and was read <pb id="pg-47-57" n="47:57"/><pb id="pg-47-58" n="47:58"/><pb id="pg-47-59" n="47:59"/>eagerly by me, and afterwards by all the house,&#x02014;with unanimous approval, with mine emphatically hearty, to begin with. I agree with every word, every word is as if <hi rend="italic">aus meinem Sinn gesprochen</hi> [as if spoken from my mind], could I but have spoken it so calmly and well! Paltry Goschen<note n="2" noteref="322">George Joachim Goschen (<date when="1831">1831</date>&#x02013;<date when="1907">1907</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33478"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), liberal unionist M.P. for the City of London, <date when="1863">1863</date>&#x02013;<date when="1880">80</date>; president of the Poor Law Board, <date when="1868">1868</date>&#x02013;<date when="1871">71</date>; in his article Froude reported Goschen&#x2019;s argument made in a speech in the House of Commons, <date when="1870-06-17">17 June</date>: &#x0201C;no case had been made out for Government interference. The supposed distress had been exaggerated. &#x02026; Trade was fast reviving. The prosperity of the working classes was returning, and as an infallible index of improvement he stated &#x02026; that they were consuming increasing quantities of beer, gin, and tobacco&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 82:277).</note> will be better for what he has got; if not, he must get more &#x00026; still sharper, People&#x2019;s Wm &#x00026; he, and all the parties to so unspeakable a plan of &#x0201C;management&#x0201D; and state of things.<note n="3" noteref="323">William Gladstone; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700603-TC-JFS-01"><corr>TC to JFS, <date when="1870-06-03">3 June.</date></corr></ref>. Gladstone thought that the colonies should eventually be given independence, while others, including TC and Froude, thought they should remain under direct British rule; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700325-TC-LG-01"><sic>46:179</sic><corr>TC to LG, <date when="1870-03-25">25 March 1870</date></corr></ref>.</note> To me it is unendurable to think of; and terpid gluttonous sooty, swoln-and-squalid England is grown a phenomenon which fills me with disgust, and apprehension almost desperate so far as <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is concerned. What a base pot-bellied blockhead this once heroic Nation has become; sunk in its own dirty fat and offal, and of a stupidity defying the very gods!&#x02014; Do not you grow desperate of it, you who have still a hoping heart and &#x0201C;a <hi rend="italic">right hand</hi> that does not shake&#x0201D;! I can conceive no burden fitter for a writing Englishman than that of awakening this poor Country to the crisis for it which is now evidently nigh, and rapidly coming nigher every day.</p>
<p>I have been to Edinburgh, on a small, most sad and sacred errand; and got a great deal of mischief from the railway whistles, and other botherations, of the 3 nights spent there. For things <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi> it is pity when there is not a <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>, or barrier of exclusion to things secular, profane and even infernal; but there is not in our poor time, except to things sham-sacred. Husht, husht.</p>
<p>I am now about lifting anchor for Chelsea again; heat having gone, and <hi rend="italic">Tellus</hi> [earth] become habitable there again. It will likely be a 10 days yet, I suppose, before the actual exodus can manage itself; but I must not let my former <hi rend="italic">utter laziness</hi> return upon me, either,&#x02014;tho&#x2019; my horror of all locomotion is extreme.</p>
<p>Of outward events the War does interest me, as it does the whole world: no war so wonderful did I ever even read of; and the results of it I reckon to be salutary, grand and hopeful beyond any such that have occurred in my time.
<pb id="pg-47-60" n="47:60"/>Paris City must be a wonderful place today! I believe the Prussians will certainly keep, for Germany, what of Lorraine and of Elsass<note n="4" noteref="324">&#x0201C;Elsass&#x0201D;: German for Alsace.</note>

The territory known as Alsace-Lorraine, on the border of France and Germany, had been disputed for centuries; under French control since the 17th century, the Prussians annexed it in <date when="1871">1871</date>; it was returned to France in <date when="1919">1919</date>. TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1870-09-10">10 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;The sudden great French Pruss<hi rend="italic">n</hi> War interests all persons,&#x02014;even me, as no other public thing for long has done. &#x02026; Masson met me [<date when="1870-09-03">3 Sept.</date>] &#x02026; with news that &#x2018;the Emperor&#x2019; so-called was pris<hi rend="italic">r</hi> of War, and my &#x2018;scandal<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Copper Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x2019; quite done for and ended,&#x02014;to pity almost even of me! &#x02026; and Paris is&#x02014;an anarchy such as never was in the world before!&#x0201D; (TC&#x2019;s journal; privately owned).</note> and withal that the whole world <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> forbid them to do it,&#x02014;and that Heaven will not (nor I). Alone of Nations Prussia still seems to understand something of the art of governing, and of <hi rend="italic">fighting enemies</hi> to said art: Germany from of old has been the peaceablest, most pious, and in the end most valiant and terriblest of Nations; Germany <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be President of Europe,&#x02014;and will again, it seems, be tried with that office (for another 5 centuries or so?).&#x02014;</p>

<p><salute>Dear Madam&#x02014;</salute>Having been in Scotland for a good while, it was not till yesterday that I got sight of your Letter. I feel much grieved at your anxieties about your Brother;<note n="1" noteref="354">George Alexander Duncan; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700609-TC-GAD-01"><corr>TC to GAD, <date when="1870-06-09">9 June.</date></corr></ref>; Margaret Duncan&#x2019;s letter untraced.</note>
 but am rather confident, withal, that your affection considerably exaggerates the matter. He seemed to me a very honest-minded, clear and pious-hearted man; and if it <hi rend="italic">be</hi> his genuine <hi rend="italic">Love of Truth</hi> (as I take it to be) that has led him into these embarrassments and miserable anxieties, you are to be patient, and also hopeful, in a very high degree, in reference to that high quality,&#x02014;the highest that can dwell in man!</p>
<p>For the rest, if he have any value for my advice, I authorize you to inform him, with all emphasis, that nobody can less approve than I do his throwing off of practical employment, and exchanging his firm land there for a sea of dubitations, to which I know too well there is neither Shore nor Bottom. Tell him, my first commandment to all men is, To find their work and do it; that except in <hi rend="italic">Work</hi>, I have long since discovered, and do steadily believe, there is no deliverance possible from Doubt. Indeed, if he has been reading <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, this I think is the main precept he will find, That the chief end of man is to work in a faithful manner; that Thinking which does not lean upon Work is an effort thrown away; and if he plead uncertainty about his Work, and cannot find what his real duty in regard to Work is, this is an excellent precept:</p>
<p>&#x0201C;Do the duty that lies nearest thee;<note n="2" noteref="355">Cf. Goethe, &#x0201C;Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 24:2), and Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 145.</note> <hi rend="small-caps">do</hi> <hi rend="italic">it</hi>; thy second duty (thy second bit of Work) will already have become clearer to thee.&#x0201D;<note n="3" noteref="356">Apparently on the advice of TC, Duncan went to Berlin to study history after graduating from the Univ. of Edinburgh in <date when="1870">1870</date>. An obituary notice in <hi rend="italic">The Academy</hi>, <date when="1906-12-29">29 Dec. 1906</date>, reported that Duncan was &#x0201C;for a time fairly successful, and besides teaching and translation work he assisted the Berlin correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>. Latterly he had an appointment in the Staff College. Through all Duncan&#x2019;s mental vicissitudes Thomas Carlyle remained his hero, and all his views and conduct of life were reduced to the standard of the Sage of Chelsea&#x0201D; (649).</note></p>
<p>This is all I have to say at present,&#x02014;except to recommend, which probably is not necessary, a kind and hopeful attitude towards your dear Brother, of whom I yet have not the least despair.</p>
<p>Believe me, dear Madam, Yours, with many good wishes,</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came to me in Scotland; and since my return last week, I have <pb id="pg-47-66" n="47:66"/>read carefully your Speech on the Education Question.<note n="1" noteref="362">Parkes wrote, <date when="1870-06-15">15 June</date>: &#x0201C;I have sent to your address by this mail a copy of our last report on Education. If you can spare time to look over it I hope you may find matter to interest you.&#x0201D; Parkes introduced the Public Schools Act <date when="1866">1866</date>, New South Wales (see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18671007-TC-JAC-01"><sic>45:44</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1867-10-07">7 Oct. 1867</date></corr></ref>), which established non-sectarian schools, and trained teachers. Parkes wrote: &#x0201C;In <date when="1869">1869</date>, having consented to open a new public school at Dundas, a village near Parramatta [suburb of Sydney], I made the occasion serve for an address of some length, expository of the new system and its successful working. &#x02026; I sent a copy of it to Mr. Carlyle, and received the following letter from him. &#x02026; The letter has an additional interest, as it also expresses his views on emigration as a question of British policy&#x0201D; (Parkes, <hi rend="italic">Fifty Years</hi> 1:201).</note>
 You are very kind to remember me so steadily, and always from time to time to send me some interesting notice of what you are about.</p>
<p>I am greatly pleased with your calm, quiet, lucid and honest Speech, and with all the useful and manful labour you have so successfully gone through for one of the most sacred interests in human affairs. The Speech, though studiously inoffensive, gives<note n="2" noteref="363">Word repeated with a line over it at turn of page.</note>
 clear indication of the much opposition you have had to confront in achieving such a bit of calm and impartial Legislation, surrounded by so many difficulties and contradictions. I well enough understand the clamours of dark sectaries, Protestant and Catholic; especially of your Irish Priests,&#x02014;the worst section of that miserable category; but I own myself much surprised that you should have incurred the estrangement of C.

<p>At all events, I can congratulate you on having laid down a plan, judicious, clear, impartial; probably the only sound plan practicable in your Colony;&#x02014;which plan is already in vigorous practice there, and will be a blessing to millions on millions of your Colonial Countrymen, and indeed more or less a benefit to all men long after we are gone.

 a growing <pb id="pg-47-67" n="47:67"/>desire that the Government would take some charge of cooperating with the Colonies in this great interest of ours; which I hope the Government, in spite of its lazy reluctances, will gradually be compelled to do. By a little human arrangement between Mother Country and her Daughters, you and Sydney for example might have as many hardy English Emigrants as you could gradually make room for, to the unspeakable advantage of us and of you! A thousand by the year, or two thousand, if you liked. But there needs cooperation, a mutual stretching out of hands on both sides of the Ocean; and, alas, on our side the one thing we are sure of is not a practical putting forth of hands in any kind of Work or Government; but a plentiful wagging of tongues in Parliament &#x00026; elsewhere. If to you, on your side of the water, any opportunity occur, I charge you not to neglect it.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter was lying here for me on my return from the Country some days ago. I yesterday received the announced Senatorial Nigger in the highest state of preservation,&#x02014;a very ugly figure indeed.<note n="1" noteref="368">Thompson apparently sent TC a photograph of Hiram Rhodes Revels (<date when="1827">1827</date>&#x02013;<date when="1901">1901</date>), U.S. minister and politician; born free in Fayetteville, N.C., he became the first African-American U.S. Senator; he took his seat as a Republican for the Mississippi State Senate, <date when="1869">1869</date>, and was then chosen as a senator for the U.S. Senate, <date when="1870-01">Jan. 1870</date>. For a photograph of Revels taken about <date when="1870">1870</date> (possibly identical to the one sent by Thompson), see <sic>opp.</sic><corr>above.</corr></note> He seems to have something <pb id="pg-47-68" n="47:68"/>of the wild Indian as well as of the d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> African;<note n="2" noteref="369">Revels was rumored to be of mixed African, Scottish, and Native American lineage.</note> but no doubt knows on which side his bread is buttered; let us hope he may throw some light into the Senate of Mississippi; which, I have no doubt, needs it, like very many other Senates. To me he is so ugly that I have at once got him provided for in a safe Apartment where he will be seen only by the indifferent or the well-affected.<note n="3" noteref="370">Revels&#x2019;s photograph is not included in the Thomas Carlyle Photograph Albums.</note></p>

 The gift of Virginia Tobacco, and of Virginia Pipes came safe to hand; nor, I can hope, did Alfred Tennyson want his due share.<note n="5" noteref="372">When Thompson returned to the U.S. he arranged to send tobacco from Virginia to TC; presumably he also sent some for Alfred Tennyson.

<p>I am not in bad health beyond what is naturally to be expected at my time of life.

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your Letter, dated 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> June, never got to me till about ten days ago; when my little Niece and I returned out of Scotland, and a long, rather empty Visit there! It had missed me here only by two or three days; and my highly <hi rend="italic">in</hi>felicitous Selectress of Letters to be forwarded<note n="1" noteref="376">Sarah Warren, TC&#x2019;s housekeeper.</note>
 had left <hi rend="italic">it</hi> carefully aside as undeserving that honour,&#x02014;good faithful old Woman, one hopes she is greatly stronger on some sides than in this literary-selective one. Certainly no Letter was forwarded that had the hundredth part of the right to be so; certainly, of all the Letters that came to me, or were left waiting here, this was, in comparison, the one which might <hi rend="italic">not</hi> with propriety have been left to be stranded forever or to wander on the wind&#x000AF; <note n="2" noteref="377">Word repeated and pluralized at turn of page.</note>
 forever!&#x02014;</p>
<p>One of my first journeys was to Chapman, with vehement <hi rend="italic">rebuke</hi> of this inconceivable &#x0201C;Cincinnati-Massachusetts&#x0201D; business.<note n="3" noteref="378">Emerson wrote, <date when="1870-06-15">15 June</date>: &#x0201C;I received duly, as I wrote you in a former letter 9 volumes &#x02026; these books oddly addressed to my name, but at CINCINNATI, Mass<hi rend="italic">tts</hi>. Whether they went to Ohio, &#x00026; came back to Boston, I know not.&#x0201D;</note>
 <hi rend="italic">Stupiditas-stupiditatum</hi> [stupidity of stupidities];<note n="4" noteref="379">TC was possibly parodying &#x0201C;vanity of vanities&#x0201D;; Eccles. 1:2.</note>
 I never in my life, not even in that unpunctual House, fell in with anything that equalled it. Instant amendment was at once undertaken for, nay it seems had been already in part performed: &#x0201C;Ten voll., following the nine you already had, were dispatched in Field &#x00026; C<hi rend="italic">o&#x2019;s</hi> box above two months ago,&#x0201D;<note n="5" noteref="380">Field, Osgood, &#x00026; Co., Boston, U.S. publishers; their London office was at 76 Mark Lane. Emerson wrote, <date when="1870-10-15">15 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;Already many days before your letter came, Fields sent me a package from you, which he said he had found a little late. &#x02026; Unhappily, Vol. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of Cromwell is wanting, and there is a duplicated of Vol. 5th instead of it.&#x0201D; He also mentioned that he had previously received a duplicate copy of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> instead of vol.1 of the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>: &#x0201C;I proposed to Fields to send back to Chapman these two duplicates. But he said, &#x2018;No, it will cost as much as the price of the books.&#x2019;&#x0201D;</note>
 so Chapman solemnly said and asserverated to me; so that by this time you ought actually to have in hand 19 voll.; and the 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> (first of <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi>), which came out ten days ago, is to go in Field &#x00026; C<hi rend="italic">o&#x2019;s</hi> Box this week, and ought, not many days after the arrival of this Letter, to be in Boston waiting for you there. The <hi rend="italic">Chapman&#x2019;s Homer</hi> (2 volumes)<note n="6" noteref="381">See <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700531-TC-RWE-01"><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1870-05-31">31 May</date></corr></ref>; Emerson wrote, <date when="1870-10-15">15 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;Now, two days ago came your letter, &#x00026; tells me that the good old gods have also inspired you to send me Chapman&#x2019;s Homer! &#x00026; that it came&#x02014;heroes with heroes&#x02014;in the same enchanted box. / I went to Fields yesterday &#x00026; demanded the book. He &#x02026; [suggested] that it must be that all these came in a box of sheets of Dickens from Chapman, which was sent to the Stereotypers at Cambridge [MA]; and the box shall be instantly explored.&#x0201D;</note>
 had gone <pb id="pg-47-71" n="47:71"/>with that first Field Packet; and would be handed to you along with the ten volls which were overdue. All this was solemnly declared to me as on Affidavit; Chapman also took extract of the Massachusetts passage in your Letter, in order to pour it like ice-cold water on the head of his stupid old Chief-Clerk,<note n="7" noteref="382">Unidentified further.</note>
 the instant the poor creature got back from his rustication: alas, I am by no means certain that it will make a new man of him, nor, in fact, that the whole of this amendatory programme will get itself performed to equal satisfaction! But you must write to me at once if it is not so; &#x00026; done it shall be in spite of human stupidity itself. Note, withal, these things: Chapman sends no Books to America <hi rend="italic">except</hi> through Field &#x00026; C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>; he does not regularly send a Box at the middle of the month; but he does &#x0201C;almost monthly send one Box&#x0201D;; so that if your monthly Volume do not start from London about the 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, it is due by the very <hi rend="italic">next</hi> Chapman-Field d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>; and if it at any time don&#x2019;t come, I beg of you very much to make instant complaint through Field &#x00026; C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, or what would be still more effectual, direct to myself. My malison on all Blockheadisms and torpid stupidities and infidelities; of which this world is full!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Your Letter had been anxiously enough waited for, a month before my departure; but we will not mention the delay in presence of what you were engaged with then.<note n="8" noteref="383">Emerson had been busy &#x0201C;writing &#x00026; reading 18 lectures&#x0201D; at Harvard; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700531-TC-RWE-01"><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1870-05-31">31 May</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 <hi rend="italic">Faustum sit</hi> [Good luck to it]; that truly was and will be a Work worth doing your best upon; and I, if alive, can promise you at least one reader that will do his best upon your Work. I myself often think of the Philosophies precisely in that manner. To say truth, they do not otherwise rise in esteem with me at all, but rather sink. The last thing I read of that kind was a piece by Hegel, in an excellent Translation by Stirling;<note n="9" noteref="384">Probably James Hutchison Stirling (<date when="1820">1820</date>&#x02013;<date when="1909">1909</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36306"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), &#x0201C;The Symbolism of the Sublime (from Hegel&#x2019;s Aesthetic),&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> (<date when="1867-10">Oct. 1867</date>); see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18671015-TC-JAC-01"><sic>45:47</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1867-10-15">15 Oct. 1867</date></corr></ref>. Stirling had also pbd. <hi rend="italic">The Secret of Hegel</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1865">1865</date>). Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (<date when="1770">1770</date>&#x02013;<date when="1831">1831</date>), German philosopher.</note>
&#x02014;right well translated, I could see, for every bit of it was intelligible to me;&#x02014;but my feeling at the end of it was;&#x02014;&#x0201C;Good Heavens, I have walked this road before many a good time; but never with a Cannon-ball at each ankle before!&#x0201D; Science also, Science falsely so-called, is&#x02014;&#x02014; But I will not enter upon that with you just now.</p>
<p>The Visit to America, alas, alas, is pure Moonshine. Never had I, in late years, the least shadow of intention to undertake that adventure;<note n="10" noteref="385">Emerson wrote, <date when="1870-06-17">17 June</date>: &#x0201C;But what do I read in our Boston Newspapers twice in the last 3 days? that &#x2018;Thomas Carlyle is coming to America,&#x2019;&#x02014;&#x00026; the tidings cordially greeted by the Editors.&#x0201D;</note>
 and I am <pb id="pg-47-72" n="47:72"/>quite at a loss to understand how the rumour originated. One Boston Gentleman (a kind of universal Undertaker, or Lion&#x2019;s Provider of Lecturers,<note n="11" noteref="386">Not further identified.</note>
 I think) informed me that &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">The Cable</hi>&#x0201D; had told him; and I had to remark &#x0201C;And who the devil told the Cable?&#x0201D;<note n="12" noteref="387">Slater noted that the &#x0201C;Boston <hi rend="italic">Daily Evening Transcript</hi> announced, on the authority of the &#x2018;British Cable&#x2019;: &#x2018;Thomas Carlyle will soon sail for the United States&#x2019;&#x0201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> <date when="571">571</date>). &#x0201C;British Cable&#x0201D; or <hi rend="italic">The Cable</hi> unidentified.</note>
 Alas, no, I fear I shall never dare to undertake that big Voyage; which has so much of romance and of reality behind it to me; <hi rend="italic">zu sp&#x000E4;t, zu sp&#x000E4;t</hi> [too late, too late]. I do sometimes talk dreamily of a long Sea-Voyage, and the good the Sea has often done me,&#x02014;in times when good was still possible. It may have been some vague folly of that kind that originated this rumour; for rumours are like dandelion-seeds; and <hi rend="italic">the Cable</hi>, I dare say, welcomes them all that have a guinea in their pocket. n.l.<note n="13" noteref="388">TC inserted &#x0201C;n.l.&#x0201D; to indicate a new paragraph should start.</note>

 Thank you a thousand times for that thrice-kind potential welcome, and flinging wide open of your doors and your hearts to me at Concord.<note n="15" noteref="390">Emerson wrote, <date when="1870-06-17">17 June</date>: &#x0201C;This house entreats you earnestly &#x00026; lovingly to come &#x00026; dwell in it.

Snipe are winter visitors to parts of Britain.</note> I heard repeatedly of your new discourses at the Scientific Association;<note n="2" noteref="393">Tyndall&#x2019;s lecture, &#x0201C;On the Scientific Use of the Imagination,&#x0201D; was delivered to the British Association at Liverpool, <date when="1870-09-16">16 Sept.</date> Tyndall concluded the lecture with one of TC&#x2019;s favorite quotations: &#x0201C;&#x2018;Two things,&#x2019; said Immanuel Kant, &#x2018;fill me with awe: the starry heavens and the sense of moral responsibility in man&#x2019;&#x0201D; (John Tyndall, <hi rend="italic">Essays on the Use and Limit of the Imagination in Science</hi> [<date when="1870">1870</date>] <date when="51">51</date>). The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported, <date when="1870-09-17">17 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;The great event of today [<date when="1870-09-16">16 Sept.</date>] was Professor Tyndall&#x2019;s Lecture on the scientific use of the imagination, delivered to a crowded audience at the Philharmonic-hall.&#x0201D; TC read Tyndall&#x2019;s first lecture on the subject, &#x0201C;On the Scientific Limit of the Imagination,&#x0201D; delivered to the British Association at Norwich, <date when="1868-08-19">19 Aug. 1868</date>, and wrote to Tyndall that he was looking forward to the sequel; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690320-TC-JTY-01"><sic>46:35&#x02013;36</sic><corr>TC to JTY, <date when="1869-03-20">20 March 1869</date></corr></ref>.</note> but did not anywhere see it, nor a readable report of it: furthermore the Copy of it did not accompany your Letter yesterday, nor has come today; so that I am still left in the dark, though not without my curiosities upon the matter. If you have by you another copy, please dispatch it at once.<note n="3" noteref="394">Presumably Tyndall promised to send TC a copy of the lecture which was pbd. immediately, price 7 shillings and 6 pence.</note>
</p>
<p>I warmly agree with all you say about this War. It is such an instance of Michael <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> Satan as I have never read in all History before. Satan getting himself smashed to impalpable pulp in one month&#x2019;s time. Bismarck, I suppose, will insist upon his Alsace and Lorraine; nor can all the world hinder him if that is his determination.<note n="4" noteref="395">See <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700907-TC-JAF-01"><corr>TC to JAF, <date when="1870-09-07">7 Sept</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 To poor France it is the frightfullest Lesson she ever had; and unless she can learn by it, which is doubtful, may be the beginning of incalculable downbreak <hi rend="italic">quod Deus avertat</hi> [may God forbid].</p>
<p>Return winged; and let us see you light at Chelsea at 9 p.m. the first night you have to yourself</p>

<p>Your anxieties about the war must have been of short duration; in fact, they must after the first few days&#x2019; practical experience have been changed into <pb id="pg-47-74" n="47:74"/>bright hope, into a hope increasing in rapid geometrical progression till it obtained its present dimensions. So far as my reading goes there never was such a war, never such a collapse of shameless human vanity, of menacing, long-continued arrogance, into contemptible nothingness. Blow has followed blow as if from the hammer of Thor,<note n="1" noteref="397">The symbolic hammer of the Norse god Thor came from his association with thunder.</note> till it lies like a shapeless heap of ruins, whining to itself, &#x2018;In the name of all the gods and all the devils, what is to become of us?&#x2019; &#x02026;</p>
<p>All Germany may now look forward to happier days in a political sense than it has seen since the Emperor Barbarossa<note n="2" noteref="398">Frederick I (<date when="1122">1122</date>&#x02013;<date when="1190">90</date>), Holy Roman Emperor, <date when="1155">1155</date>&#x02013;<date when="1190">90</date>, known as Frederick Barbarossa, one of the greatest of medieval rulers.</note> left it. My individual satisfaction in all this is great, and all England, I can say all the intelligent in Eng-land, heartily wish good fortune to brave old Germany in what it has accomplished&#x02014;a real transformation into one nation, no longer the chaotic jumble which invited the intrusion of every ill-disposed neighbour, especially of that ill-disposed France which has inflicted on it such interminable mischief during the last 400 years&#x02014;wars heaped upon wars without real cause except insatiable French ambition. All that, through God&#x2019;s grace, is now at an end. I have, in my time, seen nothing in Europe which has so much delighted me. &#x02026; &#x2018;A brave people,&#x2019; as your Goethe calls them, and as I believe a peaceful and a virtuous one. I only hope that Heaven will send them the wisdom, patience, and pious discretion to turn to a right use all that has been achieved.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Since your Letter in June, which punctually gave fortunate account of that Bank Paper for your Jane&#x2019;s &#x00026; Tom&#x2019;s behoof,<note n="1" noteref="400">Alexander&#x2019;s children; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700603-TC-AC-01"><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1870-06-03">3 June.</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 which I was glad to see &#x00026; much thanked you for, there have come addressed to the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, but for benefit of us all, Two Letters from you,&#x02014;the last only four or five days ago, forwarded <pb id="pg-47-75" n="47:75"/>hither from Dumfries.<note n="2" noteref="401">John A. Carlyle wrote, [<date when="1870-09-27">27 Sept.</date>]: &#x0201C;Both these letters from Canada have just arrived tonight (8&#x000BC; p.m.) &#x00026; I send them on at once to you.&#x0201D;</note>
 I have also had a Letter from Tom, which, you can tell him, I have read with pleasure. We are all right glad &#x00026; thankful to hear of your continued welfare, and that nothing of notable misfortune hitherto occurs to disturb the current of your days. Old age, indeed is of itself sad, and ought naturally to be, as it is with you, serious &#x00026; even solemn, not &#x0201C;joyful&#x0201D; any more; but we have all of us great reason to acknowledge with gratitude to Providence that extraordinary misfortune has visited us so rarely, &#x00026; that so many of us, brothers &#x00026; sisters, have all lived peaceably to be old men &#x00026; old women. All grown or growing old, and <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of us (I myself well a-head) already past the Psalmist&#x2019;s limit of three score &#x00026; ten.<note n="3" noteref="402">See Ps. 90:10.</note> Many a time I remember the old pious Annandale phrase, which every sinful man may well apply to himself, &#x0201C;A Monument of Mercy!&#x0201D;<note n="4" noteref="403">An expression of TC&#x2019;s mother; see <hi rend="italic">Early Letters of Thomas Carlyle</hi>, ed. C. E. Norton (<date when="1886">1886</date>) 2:242.</note>&#x02014;</p>
<p>In the end of June, as doubtless you have heard from John, we came to Dumfries (Niece Mary &#x00026; I); staid there till the middle of September. A silent, quiescent, very empty, dreary kind of life to me, cheered only by the great affection patience &#x00026; kindness of every one about me. The air was was pure &#x00026; excellent; the solitude not unbeneficial; but the railway whistles, which are near that excellent House of Jean&#x2019;s were a sore misery to me (tho&#x2019; to no one else of the smallest inconvenience); &#x00026; I lost, often in a very wretched way, on the whole, about a third part of my natural sleep; which of course was much in the way of the salutary influences there. So that I know not at this time if my health got any improvement or not; though of course the change itself was something,&#x02014;the turning of a poor sick creature from one side to another. I feel, at least, no worse; am gradually recovering my sleep here, &#x00026; hope sometimes to do a little better this winter than last. My worst inconvenience in these years is the refusal of my right hand to write for me. The left hand is yet quite steady; but the right shakes so as to render writing, if not impossible, at least intolerably slow and unsatisfactory; literally enough, the breaking of my work arm, &#x00026; cutting me off from any real employment I may still be fit for. In these weeks, however, I am trying to write by dictation (as you see here), and Mary, who is both swift &#x00026; willing, eagerly helps &#x00026; encourages; so that perhaps something may come of it. Let us hope! The<note n="5" noteref="404">A figure &#x0201C;2&#x0201D; (underlined), written above &#x0201C;The,&#x0201D; was presumably to indicate a new paragraph.</note>
 noises during my first month at Dumfries, drove me to Craigenputtock for shelter for one week (properly for five days),&#x02014;how inexpressibly sad I need not describe to you. Silent, empty, sorrowful and mournful as death &#x00026; the grave. Not in my life have I passed <pb id="pg-47-76" n="47:76"/>five more heavy-laden days. Your old stone dyke, the fence to the Cow Field which you built for us the year we were in London,<note n="6" noteref="405">TC and JWC lived at Craigenputtoch, <date when="1828">1828</date>&#x02013;<date when="1834">34</date>, but stayed in London, <date when="1831-09">Sept. 1831</date>&#x02013;<date when="1832-03">March 1832</date>.</note> that was still standing, firm every stone of it, a Memorial of affection still alive for me; <hi rend="italic">all</hi> else was of affection now in the death-realms, gone, gone, and only a sorrow &#x00026; a love for it left in me which exceeds all others. The place is all, I believe, in substantially superior order; immensities of grass upon it this season, effectually drained and a great deal of money laid into it. &#x0201C;Young Jamie,&#x0201D; who is a kindly active &#x00026; clever young fellow, standing in a far flowerier element than yours and mine was there. Well, well, how much better so, than if it had been the reverse way! I was twice at The Gill and back,&#x02014;no where else on <hi rend="italic">visit</hi>. I made two Pilgrimages, one to Ecclefechan (was some hours at Scotsbrig), another to Haddington; on what errand each of them you may conjecture. The Ecclefechan one did my heart a solemn kind of <hi rend="italic">good</hi>; the other Pilgrimage was wrong planned, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> involved three sleepless nights in Edinburgh,&#x02014;and the blessing in it was encircled by a great deal of mean wretchedness. This &#x00026; the day&#x2019;s railwaying hither, which soon followed, was all the journeying I did.</p>
<p>The D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I suppose, gives you precise accounts of all the little Annandale history, &#x00026; the doings &#x00026; conditions of our kindred there; so that I need not enter upon that head. Outwardly, they seem to me to be all prospering. Old age not crushed down with any burdens except its own. Sister Mary at The Gill is as loving-hearted as ever, not specially in ill-health either, so far as I could notice though looking worn &#x00026; old, as she well may.</p>
<p>Jamie, I fear, suffers a great deal from want of health mid his economic prosperity,&#x02014;sleeps very badly, eats very badly, and, I fear, has nobody at Scotsbrig to do well for him what is still do-able by way of cheering his now lonely home for him.<note n="7" noteref="406">Jamie&#x2019;s wife, Isabella, d. <date when="1859-06">June 1859</date>.</note> His Son John is said to be less sympathetic with him than Jamie is; and John&#x2019;s Wife is, hitherto, tho&#x2019; a very amiable looking, innocent creature, extremely helpless in domestic matters. Daughter Jenny was with him during part of our time. He seems to spend a good portion of every summer at Birmingham on visit to her Husband &#x00026; her; and, at other seasons pretty frequently comes &#x00026; goes to Craigenputtock for a week or two at a time. He makes no complaint to any of us; is a hardy, steel-grey little fellow, and as emphatic of speech and as decided of conduct as ever he was.</p>
<p>Dear Brother, I doubt you have abundantly enough of this; and, at any rate, my own time is up. If you would write me similar details about yourself and Bield, it would be right welcome to me, and I could write in a similar strain as copiously once more. Pray tell me about poor old John, our half-brother.<note n="8" noteref="407">See 46:6&#x02013;7 and 40.</note>
 <pb id="pg-47-77" n="47:77"/>I often think inquiringly about him &#x00026; what is becoming of him in his lonely old age. Some rumour was going among us that he was to come over to Bield to spend some of the dark months with you. Was that true or not? Give my affectionate regards to him, and to every one of yo[urs,] down to the youngest; especially to Tom &#x00026; Jane, whom I personally know.<note n="9" noteref="408">See <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700504-TC-TCA-01"><corr>TC to TCA, <date when="1870-05-04">4 May</date></corr></ref>.</note> [May Go]d&#x2019;s blessing be on you and yours. <closer><salute>Dear Brother, Ever affectionat[el]y</salute> <signed><name>T.

<salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>
<p>On Saturday morning, on my first sally out into the open air, I noticed on a Newsvendor&#x2019;s Placard that there was a &#x0201C;Letter from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ruskin,&#x0201D;<note n="1" noteref="411"><hi rend="italic">The Daily Telegraph</hi> pbd. two letters on the Franco-Prussian War by John Ruskin, <date when="1870-10-07">7</date> and <date when="1870-10-08">8 Oct.</date></note> which it would be necessary for me to see. Not having the copper penny in my pocket, I took the necessary steps immediately on my return home; and, along with my Coffee, comfortably swallowed the <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Letter</hi> accordingly;&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">more</hi> comfortably than I did my Coffee, for which, alas, as for all other material things (tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> for things spiritual, thank God), there is now a clearly decaying appetite.<note n="2" noteref="412">Ruskin replied, [<date when="1870-10-12">12 Oct.</date>]: &#x0201C;You must not cease enjoying your coffee&#x02014; All your work is grandly done&#x02014;and it is just time for coffee, &#x00026; pipe&#x02014;and peace.&#x0201D;</note>

<p>In the course of the day I learnt that there had been another <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi>, which somehow must be attained here; and, by our last post, came your beneficent announcement that both <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> had been duly put underway by you.

The Nemesis of battle may indeed be near her; greater glory she cannot win by the taking of Paris, nor overrunning of the provinces&#x02014;she only prolongs suffering, redoubles death, extends loss, incalculable and irremediable. But let her now give unconditional armistice, and offer terms that France can accept with honour, and she will bear such rank among the nations as never yet shone on Christian history.&#x0201D;</note></p>

<salute>Dear Maccall,</salute>
<p>I saw Chapman yesterday; he has in nothing changed his ideas about employing you in translation; but professes to have been held back not only by a bad fit of Rheumatism &#x00026;c, but also by the provoking fact that certain Woodcuts, indispensable for the Book you are to translate, lie at the moment unattainable in Paris across the Prussian line!<note n="1" noteref="431">Paris was under siege by the Prussians from <date when="1870-09">Sept. 1870</date> until <date when="1871-01">Jan. 1871</date>.</note>
 He certainly seemed to me to intend and wish employing you in translation; but you must not be surprized to find him now &#x00026; then, so many are the Irons he has in the fire, a considerably unpunctual man of business. For the rest, he told me yesterday that his common outlay for Translation is latterly almost &#x000A3;500 a year (suppose it were <pb id="pg-47-83" n="47:83"/>arithmetically but the half of that sum!); and I do believe he is convinced that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can do that Work for him probably better than any other man he has on his pay. My advice is, therefore: Patience and shuffle the Cards.</p>
<p>That message of Tait&#x2019;s<note n="2" noteref="432">Presumably Robert Scott Tait; message untraced.</note> is surely a beautiful bit of munificence of some noble-hearted Friend who wishes, like Heaven, to do good in absolute silence that there be no danger of human admixture with it.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept many thanks from me for your beautiful Autumnal Gift,<note n="1" noteref="434">Charles Augustus Ward wrote, <date when="1870-10-18">18 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;Kindly accept a box of Elva plums.&#x0201D; Ward regularly sent TC gifts of autumn fruit; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18691119-MAI-CAW-01"><sic>46:113</sic><corr>MAI to CAW, <date when="1869-11-19">19 Nov. 1869</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 which reminds me kindly of Pomona<note n="2" noteref="435">Pomona, Roman goddess of fruit trees and orchards.</note>
 in her Southern opulences; and has many grateful and pathetic meanings to me. As a mark of your continued regard, in the midst of such interruptions and long-continued absences, I greatly prize it: thankful to find that, amid this loud swift whirl, of personal business and public event, you still keep me in mind;&#x02014;that is certainly a precious fact!&#x02014;</p>
<p>It is long months, almost years, since I have personally seen you,<note n="3" noteref="436">They probably last met <date when="1867-09">Sept. 1867</date>; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18671015-TC-JAC-01"><sic>45:48</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1867-10-15">15 Oct. 1867</date></corr></ref>.</note> though you have once or twice left a card. No doubt your modest reserve is much to be applauded; but I regret withal that it issues in this manner. Cannot you, at present, while Countinghouse operations are slack, come, some day, and let us have a walk once more together?<note n="4" noteref="437">Ward replied, <date when="1870-10-21">21 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;Your kind letter gives me much pleasure. I do not know however whether your walk takes place on Sundays but at any rate I shall <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> next Sunday look in upon you at 2.30. &#x02026; I can come no day but Sunday at the <hi rend="italic">hour</hi> specified. The Counting House with me makes inexorable demands on attention.&#x0201D;</note>
 I go out daily with that object at, or rather before 3 p.m.; and seldom have company (if, as is rather the exceptional case, I have company at all) which I should prefer to yours.&#x02014; &#x02014;</p>
<p>You seem to me, if you will allow me to say so, much in error in regard to King William and his Germans. I believe King William to be a just and pious as well as valiant man, and that his &#x0201C;Prayers to God&#x0201D; are not a thing of Cant, but of profound Sincerity<note n="5" noteref="438">Ward wrote, <date when="1870-10-18">18 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;This French War touches the wine business. However that is not much matter when men&#x2019;s hearths are trampled on to gratify the lust of Kings &#x00026; their Viziers. That psalm-singing old William full of prayer &#x00026; gratitude is amusing in his familiar intimacy with the Secret Immensity who made him &#x00026; the Universe. [His] god however is Moloch a god of slush &#x00026; abattoirs.&#x0201D; Wilhelm (William) Friedrich Ludwig von Hohenzollern (<date when="1797">1797</date>&#x02013;<date when="1888">1888</date>), king of Prussia, <date when="1861">1861</date>&#x02013;<date when="1888">88</date>, and 1st German Emperor, <date when="1871">1871</date>&#x02013;<date when="1888">88</date>.</note>&#x02014;in a word, that he is one of the few living European</p>

<p>I also differ altogether as to the probable results of French &#x0201C;National Enthusiasm&#x0201D; in defending Paris &#x00026;c &#x00026;c.<note n="6" noteref="439">Following the defeat of the French army at Sedan, <date when="1870-09-02">2 Sept.</date>, popular pressure forced the creation of a provisional Republican government in Paris on <date when="1870-09-04">4 Sept.</date> The Prussians laid siege to Paris from <date when="1870-09-18">18 Sept.</date>, but Parisians refused to accept that the war had been lost, and the authorities were reluctant to negotiate peace terms.

This &#x0201C;praying&#x0201D; King William has actually his foot upon the throat of France, and can if he please, in spite of all Europe, as matters now stand, slit anarchic France to ribbons, and reduce Paris to a Cinder, if such were his intention, which it is far from being.</p>

<p>In brief, I believe magnanimous, pious, strong, and modest Germany is henceforth to be Queen of the Continent, instead of vain, vapouring, impious and mischievous France;<note n="7" noteref="440">The <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi> included contrasting post-Sedan pictures of lines of French prisoners of war and lines of wounded German soldiers; see 84.</note> which I take to be the most blessed event in European politics I have witnessed in my time.<note n="8" noteref="441">See also TC to the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1870-11-11">11 Nov.</date> For Wilhelm&#x2019;s proclamation in Versailles, <date when="1871-01-18">18 Jan. 1871</date>, as emperor of a united Germany, see 85.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Late last night came the enclosed Letter from one whom you knew well,<note n="1" noteref="443">Baron Charles d&#x2019;Eichthal, with whom John A.

D&#x2019;Eichthal wrote, <date when="1870-10-24">24 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;It is, I know, a great liberty I take in taking into my hand the pen to molest you for a few moments. &#x02026; I had the great satisfaction to be introduced to you (in Chelsea) by your excellent brother who had been my friend for many years.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>We had a pleasant word from you not long ago<note n="1" noteref="452">Forster wrote from Steyne Hotel, Worthing, Sussex, <date when="1870-10-23">23 Oct.</date>; both he and Eliza had been ill, but &#x0201C;things are a little better with us now. &#x02026; And the first thought we have, with our more cheerful outlook, is of the dear good Carlyle and the kind little Mary.&#x0201D;</note>
 and are beginning to long much to hear of you again. If it is not increase of Cough or other ill-luck that delays you?<note n="2" noteref="453">Forster replied, <date when="1870-11-04">4 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;I have a hard struggle with my cough, notwithstanding the kindly south and west winds &#x02026; on the whole I have got on fairly well here. &#x02026; <hi rend="italic">So</hi> well, that I do not think we will turn homeward till the holiday is fairly out&#x02014;which will be exactly three weeks from today.&#x0201D;</note>
 That would indeed be bad; but I hope it is only the miserable weather; or perhaps, which would be luckiest of all, increased application to the pious <hi rend="italic">Task</hi><note n="3" noteref="454">Forster was &#x0201C;at intervals turning to the inexpressively sorrowful task of looking over poor Dickens&#x2019;s letters. Whether anything will come it of I do not know&#x0201D; (<date when="23-10">23 Oct.</date>). He was to publish <hi rend="italic">The Life of Charles Dickens</hi> in <date when="1872">1872</date>&#x02013;<date when="1874">74</date>.</note>
 you mentioned. In any case, pray send us a little world;&#x02014;and especially say when you are coming home.</p>
<p>I myself have, as it were, no history at all since you left. I <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> pretty well, indeed almost like a common fellow-creature; but the dark muddy weather presses heavy on me in the multitudinous uproar of this London element; which has grown to have so little, or so altogether sad a meaning to me: I feel heavy-laden, stupid, inarticulate, to a degree. I am much bothered with insignificant Letters (which I mostly burn unanswered) about the German-French quarrel &#x00026;c; and altogether as much disgusted as yourself at this maudlin wail about the woes of France,&#x02014;a Country that to me more resembles a <hi rend="italic">Car</hi>touche upon the Gallows<note n="4" noteref="455">Forster wrote, <date when="1870-10-23">23 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;What a wonderful line the papers are taking about the poor &#x02026; martyr France&#x02014;as if another Calvary were come.&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Cartouche&#x0201D; was the nickname of Louis Dominique Garthausen (<date when="1693">1693</date>&#x02013;<date when="1721">1721</date>), French bandit and highwayman, eventually executed in Paris.</note>
 than a Christ upon Calvary. If I were not so dark and stupid, nay, perhaps, if I still had my own <hi rend="italic">right hand</hi>, I should write something on that monstrous ignorance of the English Nation about European history and the nature of Facts in this world; but perhaps it is better not. I all along calculate Bismarck will do his own way; and I calculate he can do it in spite, not of poor broken-backed France alone, but of all Europe combined at this particular juncture.<note n="5" noteref="456">John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1870-10-23">23 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;a few clear &#x00026; faithful words from you, who know the subject so thoroughly, might do much good&#x0201D;; Jean Aitken also wrote, <date when="1870-10-23">23 Oct.</date>, urging TC to write on the Franco-Prussian War: &#x0201C;It could not fail to do good.&#x0201D; Forster replied, <date when="1870-11-04">4 Nov.</date>, that Mary Aitken&#x2019;s clear handwriting was &#x0201C;more than recompense for temporary loss of your own&#x02014;above all what an inducement to turn off, in so choice a hand, that paper I very earnestly would have you put forth on what is now going forward in the world!&#x0201D; TC wrote a long letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on the war (pbd. <date when="1870-11-18">18 Nov.</date>); see TC to ed. of <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1870-11-11">11 Nov.</date> Mary Aitken wrote to Lady Ashburton, [<date when="1870-11-19">19 Nov.</date>]: &#x0201C;He was busy writing the Letter to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> or he would have gone to you at Stanhope St on Friday [<date when="1870-11-11">11 Nov.</date>] (I wrote it to dictation&#x02014;his hand being so troublesome to him). He is very well just now and says he is so glad to have relieved his conscience by writing this Letter&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. <date when="11388">11388</date>).</note>

 <p>Sir,&#x02014;It is probably an amiable trait of human nature, this cheap pity and newspaper lamentation over fallen and afflicted France;<note n="1" noteref="462">TC presumably referred mainly to reports and commentary in print newspapers.

At the death of Louis the Pious (<date when="778">778</date>&#x02013;<date when="840">840</date>), son of Charlemagne (<date when="742">742</date>&#x02013;<date when="814">814</date>), who had ruled most of Europe, his territory was divided, by the Treaty of Verdun (<date when="843">843</date>), between his three surviving sons, Lothair (<date when="795">795</date>&#x02013;<date when="855">855</date>), Louis (ca. <date when="804">804</date>&#x02013;<date when="876">76</date>), and Charles (<date when="823">823</date>&#x02013;<date when="877">77</date>); the central area was given to Lothar, and thus known as Lotharingia (which was to become Lothringen, German name for Lorraine). This area has been fought over by its independent rulers, the dukes of Burgundy, the kings of France, and the Holy Roman Emperors and their German successors, many times since. Alsace was part of the Holy Roman Empire until annexed by France in <date when="1639">1639</date>; Lorraine was more or less independent, although occupied by France <date when="1641">1641</date>&#x02013;<date when="1648">48</date>, <date when="1670">1670</date>&#x02013;<date when="1697">97</date>, and then from <date when="1766">1766</date>; both were annexed, <date when="1871">1871</date>, after being captured by Bismarck&#x2019;s Prussian forces, <date when="1870">1870</date>. For maps of France and of Alsace and Lorraine, <date from="1101" to="1600">12th to 16th centuries</date>, see <sic>92</sic><corr>above</corr>.</note> The question for the Germans, in this crisis, is not one of &#x0201C;magnanimity,&#x0201D; of &#x0201C;heroic pity and forgiveness to a fallen foe,&#x0201D; but of solid prudence and practical consideration what the fallen foe will, in all likelihood, do when once on his feet again. Written on her memory, in a dismally instructive manner, Germany has an experience of 400 years on this point; of which on the English memory, if it ever was recorded there, there is now little or no trace visible.</p>

 But it ended more successfully for old Louis and his French than I hope the present quarrel will.

<p>The Revolution and Napoleon I., and their treatment of Germany, are still in the memory of men and newspapers; but that was not by any means, as idle men and newspapers seem to think, the first of Germany&#x2019;s sufferings from France; it was the last of a very long series of such&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">the last but one</hi>, let us rather say; and hope that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> now going on as &#x0201C;Siege of Paris,&#x0201D;<note n="23" noteref="484">Siege of Paris, <date when="1870-09-19">19 Sept. 1870</date>&#x02013;<date when="1871-01-28">28 Jan. 1871</date>; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701017-TC-WM-01"><corr>TC to WM, <date when="1870-10-17">17 Oct.</date></corr></ref>.; for further illustrations connected to the siege, see 88, 138, and 146.</note>

 may be the last! No nation ever had so bad a neighbour as Germany has had in France for the last 400 years; bad in all manner of ways; insolent, rapacious, insatiable, unappeasable, continually aggressive.</p>

<p>And now, furthermore, in all history there is no insolent, unjust neighbour that ever got so complete, instantaneous, and ignominious a smashing down as France has now got from Germany. Germany, after 400 years of ill-usage, and generally ill-fortune, from that neighbour, has had at last the great happiness to see its enemy fairly down in this manner; and Germany, I do clearly believe, would be a foolish nation not to think of raising up some secure boundary-fence between herself and such a neighbour now that she has the chance.</p>
<p>There is no law of nature that I know of, no Heaven&#x2019;s Act of Parliament, whereby France, alone of terrestrial beings, shall not restore any portion of her plundered goods when the owners they were wrenched from have an opportunity upon them. To nobody, except to France herself for the moment, can it be credible that there is such a law of nature. Alsace and Lorraine were not got, either of them, in so divine a manner as to render that a probability. The cunning of Richelieu, the grandiose long-sword of Louis XIV., these are the only titles of France to those German countries. Richelieu screwed them loose (and, by happy accident, there was a Turenne,<note n="25" noteref="486">Henri de La Tour d&#x2019;Auvergne (<date when="1611">1611</date>&#x02013;<date when="1675">75</date>), vicomte de Turenne, French marshal general.</note>

 Louis le Grand, with his Turenne as supreme of modern Generals, managed the rest of the operation, except indeed, I should say, the burning of the Palatinate, from Heidelberg Palace steadily downwards, into black ruin; which Turenne would not do sufficiently, and which Louis had to get done by another.<note n="27" noteref="488">The Palatinate, an electorate of the Holy Roman Emperor adjacent to Alsace and Lorraine (see 92 [top right of map]); Turenne had implemented Louis&#x2019; policies, and devastated the Palatinate countryside, <date when="1674">1674</date>. In <date when="1689">1689</date> Louis again instituted a scorched&#x02014;earth policy in the Palatinate, including the burning of Heidelberg; by this time Turenne was dead, so it was carried out by Ren&#x000E9; de Froulay (<date when="1648">1648</date>&#x02013;<date when="1725">1725</date>), Comte de Tess&#x000E9;, soldier and diplomat.</note>
 There was also a good deal of extortionate law-practice, what we may fairly call violently sharp Attorneyism, put in use.

Metz, the original capital of Lotharingia, had been absorbed as a free independent city into the Holy Roman Empire, annexed by France, <date when="1552">1552</date>.

 were once of high infamy, and much complained of, here in England, and everywhere else beyond the Rhine. The Grand Louis, except by sublime gesture, ironically polite, made no answer. He styled himself on his very coins (&#x000E9;cu of <date when="1687">1687</date>, say the Medallists), <hi rend="italic">Excelsus super omnes Gentes Dominus</hi> [God is above all people], but it is certain attorneyism of the worst sort was one of his instruments in this conquest of Alsace.

Strasburg was got in time of profound peace by bribing the magistrates to do treason, on his part, and admit his garrison one night.<note n="29" noteref="490">Strasbourg, a free independent city in the Holy Roman Empire; peacefully annexed by Louis XIV&#x2019;s forces after negotiation with the citizens, <date when="1681-09-30">30 Sept. 1681</date>.</note>
 Nor as to Metz la Pucelle, nor any of these Three Bishoprics,<note n="30" noteref="491">Metz was known as Metz la Pucelle [the maiden], because it had fought so often to retain its freedom, and was regarded as impregnable.

 did nothing for Protestantism or German liberty (German liberty managing rapidly to help itself in this instance); and then, like a brazen-faced, unjust pawnbroker, refused to give the places back,&#x02014;had ancient rights over them, extremely indubitable to him, and could not give them back.

I believe it to be perfectly just, rational, and wise that Germany should take these countries home with her from her unexampled campaign, and, by well fortifying her own old <hi rend="italic">Wasgau</hi> (&#x0201C;Vosges&#x0201D;), Hundsr&#x000FC;ck (<hi rend="italic">Dog&#x2019;s-back</hi>),<note n="34" noteref="495">Wasgau / Vosges and Hunsr&#x000FC;ck are low mountain ranges in the Rhineland-Palatinate.</note>

<p>The French complain dreadfully of threatened &#x0201C;loss of honour;&#x0201D; and lamentable bystanders plead earnestly, &#x0201C;Don&#x2019;t dishonour France; leave poor France&#x2019;s honour bright.&#x0201D; But will it save the <hi rend="italic">honour</hi> of France to refuse paying for the glass she has voluntarily broken in her neighbour&#x2019;s windows? The attack upon the windows was her dishonour. Signally disgraceful to any nation was her late assault on Germany; equally signal has been the ignominy of its execution on the part of France. The honour of France can be saved only by the deep repentance of France, and by the serious determination never to do so again&#x02014;to do the reverse of so for ever henceforth. In that way may the honour of France again gradually brighten to the height of its old splendour, far beyond the <hi rend="italic">First</hi> Napoleonic, much more the <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, or any recent sort, and offer again to our voluntary love and grateful estimation all the fine and graceful qualities Nature has implanted in the French. For the present, I must say, France looks more and more delirious, miserable, blamable, pitiable, and even contemptible. She refuses to see the facts that are lying palpable before her face, and the penalties she has brought upon herself. A France scattered into anarchic ruin, without recognizable head;<note n="35" noteref="496">Napoleon III (Louis Napoleon) lost power after being taken prisoner, <date when="1870-09">Sept. 1870</date>; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700907-TC-JAF-01"><corr>TC to JAF, <date when="1870-09-07">7 Sept.</date></corr></ref>. and above.</note>

 ballasted with nothing <pb id="pg-47-99" n="47:99"/>but outrageous public lies, proclamations of victories that were creatures of the fancy; a Government subsisting altogether on mendacity, willing that horrid bloodshed should continue and increase rather than that <hi rend="italic">they</hi>, beautiful Republican creatures, should cease to have the guidance of it: I know not when or where there was seen a nation so covering itself with <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>honour. If, among this multitude of sympathetic bystanders, France have any true friend, his advice to France would be,&#x02014;To abandon all that, and never to resume it more. France really ought to know that &#x0201C;refuges of lies&#x0201D; were long ago discovered to lead down only to the Gates of Death Eternal,<note n="37" noteref="498">See Isa. 28:17&#x02013;18.</note>
 and to be forbidden to all creatures!&#x02014;that the one hope for France is to recognize the facts which have come to her, and that they came withal by invitation of her own: how she&#x02014;a mass of gilded, proudly varnished anarchy&#x02014;has wilfully insulted and defied to mortal duel a neighbour not anarchic, but still in a quietly human, sober, and governed state, and has prospered accordingly. Prospered as an array of sanguinary mountebanks <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> a Macedonian phalanx<note n="38" noteref="499">A Macedonian phalanx was an infantry formation devised by Philip II (382&#x02013;336 BCE), king of Macedon; the Prussian army used similar tactics.</note>
 must needs do;&#x02014;and now lies smitten down into hideous wreck and impotence, testifying to gods and men what extent of rottenness, anarchy, and hidden vileness lay in her. That the inexorable fact is, she has left herself without resource or power of resisting the victorious Germans; and that her wisdom will be to take that fact into her astonished mind; to know that, howsoever hateful, said fact is inexorable, and will have to be complied with,&#x02014;the <hi rend="italic">sooner</hi> at the cheaper rate. It is a hard lesson to vainglorious France; but France, we hope, has still in it veracity and probity enough to accept fact as an evidently adamantine entity, which will not brook resistance without penalty, and is unalterable by the very gods.</p>
<p>The quantity of conscious mendacity that France, official and other, has perpetrated latterly, especially since July last,<note n="39" noteref="500">France declared war on Prussia, <date when="1870-07">July 1870</date>; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700826-TC-JF-01"><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1870-08-26">26 Aug.</date></corr></ref></note>
 is something wonderful and fearful. And, alas, perhaps even that is small compared to the self-delusion and <hi rend="italic">un</hi>conscious mendacity long prevalent among the French; which is of still feller and more poisonous quality, though unrecognized for poison. To me, at times, the mournfullest symptom in France is the figure its &#x0201C;men of genius,&#x0201D; its highest literary speakers, who should be prophets and seers to it, make at present, and, indeed, for a generation back have been making. It is evidently their belief that new celestial wisdom is radiating out of France upon all the other overshadowed nations; that France is the new Mount Zion of the universe; <pb id="pg-47-100" n="47:100"/>and that all this sad, sordid, semi-delirious, and, in good part, <hi rend="italic">infernal</hi> stuff which French Literature has been preaching to us for the last 50 years is a veritable new Gospel out of Heaven, pregnant with blessedness for all the sons of men. Alas, one does understand that France made her Great Revolution; uttered her tremendous doom&#x2019;s voice against a world of human shams, proclaiming, as with the great Last Trumpet,<note n="40" noteref="501">See 1 Cor. 15:52.</note>
 that shams should be no more. I often call that a celestial-infernal phenomenon&#x02014;the most memorable in our world for a thousand years; on the whole, a transcendant revolt against the Devil and his works (since shams are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> and sundry of the Devil, and poisonous and unendurable to man). For that we all infinitely love and honour France. And truly all nations are now busy enough copying France in regard to that! From side to side of the civilized world there is, in a manner, nothing noticeable but the whole world in deep and dismally chaotic Insurrection against Shams, determination to have done with shams <hi rend="italic">co&#x000FB;te qu&#x2019;il co&#x000FB;te</hi> [cost what it may]. Indispensable that battle, however ugly. Well done, we may say to all that; for it is the preliminary to everything; but, alas, all that is not yet victory; it is but half the battle, and the much easier half. The infinitely harder half, which is the equally or the still more indispensable, is that of achieving, instead of the abolished shams which were of the Devil, the practicable realities which should be veritable and of God. That <hi rend="italic">first</hi> half of the battle, I rejoice to see, is now safe, can now never cease except in victory; but the further stage of it, I also see, must be under better presidency than that of France, or <hi rend="italic">it</hi> will for ever prove impossible. The German race, not the Gaelic [possibly in error for Gallic], are now to be protagonist in that immense world-drama; and from them I expect better issues. Worse we cannot well have. France, with a dead-lift effort, now of 81 years,<note n="41" noteref="502">The French Revolution began in <date when="1789">1789</date>.</note>
 has accomplished under this head, for herself or for the world, nothing, or even less,&#x02014;in strict arithmetic, <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> with <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> quantities. Her prophets prophesy a vain thing; her people rove in darkness and have wandered far astray.</p>
<p>Such prophets and such a people;&#x02014;who in the way of deception and self-deception have carried it far! &#x0201C;Given up to strong delusion,&#x0201D; as the Scripture says; till, at last, the lie seems to them the very truth.<note n="42" noteref="503">See 2 Thess. 2:11; see also Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 5:241, where TC uses the phrase about Napoleon.</note>
 And now, in their strangling crisis and extreme need, they appear to have no resource but self-deception still, and quasi-heroic gasconade. They do believe it to be heroic. They believe that they are the &#x0201C;Christ of Nations;&#x0201D;<note n="43" noteref="504">&#x0201C;Christ of Nations&#x0201D;; phrase sometimes used of republican France.</note>

I wish they would inquire whether there might not be a &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Cartouche</hi><note n="44" noteref="505">&#x0201C;Cartouche&#x0201D; was the nickname of the French highwayman Louis Dominique Gart&#x173;hausen; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701102-TC-JF-01"><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1870-11-02">2 Nov.</date></corr></ref></note>
 of Nations,&#x0201D; fully as likely as a &#x0201C;Christ of Nations&#x0201D; in our time! Cartouche had many gallant qualities, was much admired, and much pitied in his sufferings, and had many fine ladies begging locks of his hair while the inexorable, indispensable gibbet was preparing. But in the end there was no salvation for Cartouche. Better he should obey the heavy-handed Teutsch police-officer, who has him by the windpipe in such frightful manner; give up part of his stolen goods; altogether cease to be a Cartouche, and try to become again a Chevalier Bayard<note n="45" noteref="506">Pierre Terrail (ca. <date when="1473">1473</date>&#x02013;<date when="1524">1524</date>), seigneur de Bayard, French soldier known as &#x0201C;le chevalier sans peur et sans reproche&#x0201D; or &#x0201C;le bon chevalier&#x0201D;; the epitome of chivalry. His entire life was spent in military service for France.</note>
 under improved conditions, and a blessing and beautiful benefit to all his neighbours, instead of too much the reverse, as now! Clear it is, at any rate, singular as it may seem to France, all Europe does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come to the rescue, in gratitude for the heavenly &#x0201C;illumination&#x0201D; it is getting from France: nor could all Europe, if it did, at this moment prevent that awful Chancellor<note n="46" noteref="507">Bismarck; TC uses &#x0201C;awful&#x0201D; in its original sense of &#x0201C;full of awe.&#x0201D;</note>
 from having his own way. Metz and the boundary-fence, I reckon, will be dreadfully hard to get out of that Chancellor&#x2019;s hands again.</p>

), and into total oblivion by his nation, which, except Chatham, has none such to remember. That Bismark, and Germany along with him, should now at this propitious juncture make a like demand is no surprise to me. After such provocation, and after such a victory, the resolution does seem rational, just, and even modest. And considering all that has occurred since that memorable cataclysm at Sedan,<note n="52" noteref="513">Battle of Sedan; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700907-TC-JAF-01"><corr>TC to JAF, <date when="1870-09-07">7 Sept.</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 I could reckon it creditable to the sense and moderation of Count Bismark that he stands steadily by this; demanding nothing more, resolute to take nothing less, and advancing with a slow calmness towards it by the eligiblest roads. The &#x0201C;Siege of Paris,&#x0201D; which looks like the hugest and most hideous farce-tragedy ever played under this sun, Bismark evidently hopes will never need to come to uttermost bombardment, to million-fold death by hunger, or the kindling of Paris and its carpentries and asphalt streets by shells and red-hot balls into a sea of fire. Diligent, day by day, seem those Prussians, never resting nor too much hasting; well knowing the proverb, &#x0201C;Slow fire makes sweet malt.&#x0201D; I believe Bismark will get his Alsace and what he wants of Lorraine; and likewise that it will do him, and us, and all the world, and even France itself by and by, a great deal of good. Anarchic France gets her first stern lesson there (a terribly drastic dose of physic to sick France!); and well will it be for her if she can learn her lesson honestly. If she cannot, she will get another, and ever another; learnt the lesson must be.</p>
<p>Considerable misconception as to Herr von Bismark is still prevalent in England. The English newspapers, nearly all of them, seem to me to be only getting towards a true knowledge of Bismarck,<note n="53" noteref="514">Thus in text; otherwise the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> used the spelling &#x0201C;Bismark&#x0201D; throughout.</note>
 but not yet got to it. The standing likeness, circulating everywhere ten years ago, of demented Bismark and his ditto King to Strafford and Charles I. <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> our Long Parliament<note n="54" noteref="515">In <date when="1862">1862</date> the Prussian Diet refused to authorize increased funding for the army.

Thomas Wentworth (<date when="1593">1593</date>&#x02013;<date when="1641">1641</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29056"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 1st earl of Strafford, chief minister to Charles I. The English Long Parliament, called in <date when="1640">1640</date> to raise money for troops, not only refused Charles money, it passed death warrants for Charles&#x2019;s advisors, including Strafford, and passed laws saying it could only be dissolved by its own members.</note>

That pathetic Niobe of Denmark, reft violently of her children<note n="56" noteref="517">Niobe, character in Greek mythology whose children were taken from her; the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, which had been mainly under Danish overlordship, were annexed by Prussia in the second Schleswig-Holstein war, <date when="1864">1864</date>.</note>
 (which were stolen children, and were dreadfully ill-nursed by Niobe Denmark), is also nearly gone, and will go altogether so soon as knowledge of the matter is had. Bismark, as I read him, is not a person of &#x0201C;Napoleonic&#x0201D; ideas, but of ideas quite superior to Napoleonic; shows no invincible &#x0201C;lust of territory,&#x0201D; nor is tormented with &#x0201C;vulgar ambition,&#x0201D; &#x00026;c; but has aims very far beyond that sphere; and in fact seems to me to be striving with strong faculty, by patient, grand, and successful steps, towards an object beneficial to Germans and to all other men. That noble, patient, deep, pious, and solid Germany should be at length welded into a nation and become Queen of the Continent, instead of vapouring, vainglorious, gesticulating, quarrelsome, restless, and over-sensitive France, seems to me the hopefullest public fact that has occurred in my time.</p>

<p>Poor Mary and I have had a terrible ten days,&#x02014;properly a Much Ado about Nothing&#x02014; It concerned only that projected Letter to the Newspapers about Germany;<note n="6" noteref="525">Cf.

Poor Mary had endless patience, endless assiduity, wrote like a little fairy, sharp as a needle, &#x00026; all that could be expected of her, when it came to writing; and before that, there was such hauling down of old forgotten books, <hi rend="italic">K&#x000F6;hlers</hi>, <hi rend="italic">B&#x000FC;schings Reichshistories, Biographies</hi><note n="7" noteref="526">Johann David K&#x00F6;hler (<date when="1684">1684</date>&#x02013;<date when="1755">1755</date>), historian; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540428-TC-JN-01"><sic>29:73</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1854-04-28">28 April 1854</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541020-TC-JN-01"><sic>174</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1854-10-20">20 Oct. 1854</date></corr></ref>; Anton Friedrich B&#x000FC;sching (<date when="1724">1724</date>&#x02013;<date when="1793">93</date>), geographer and historian; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550619-TC-JN-01"><sic>29:335</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1855-06-19">19 June 1855</date></corr></ref>; TC used their books while writing <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (TC&#x2019;s copies; HCC).</note> &#x00026;c &#x00026;c, in all which my little Helpmate was nimble and unwearied.

I do not reckon it a good Letter; but it expresses, in a probably <hi rend="italic">too</hi> emphatic way, what my convictions are; &#x00026; is a clearance to my own conscience in that matter, whether it do good or not, whether it <hi rend="italic">be</hi> good or not. I expect it may be considerably an astonishment to many half &#x00026; half people, lamenters for the French; but am myself on any terms, right thankful to have done with it, and there an end. Of course I will take care that you see it, if you yourself don&#x2019;t take care.

I have not seen him in these last ten days; but probably shall next week. By a little Note of Forster&#x2019;s which Mary will enclose if she can find it, you will see that the negociation is not yet extinct;<note n="11" noteref="530">Forster wrote, <date when="1870-11-08">8 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;I forgot &#x02026; to ask you whether anything had been done further in the matter of your nephew and the Mr Harding proposals&#x02014;and whether it is at all possible that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could capably do anything?&#x0201D;</note> nor shall it quite go out till I see it hopeless.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You will find that immortal Letter to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> in tomorrow&#x2019;s (Thursday&#x2019;s) Number.<note n="1" noteref="535">The letter appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on Fri., <date when="1870-11-18">18 Nov.</date> John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1870-11-18">18 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;Your letter, I think, will do a great deal of good, both in this country &#x00026; in Germany. &#x02026; John [Aitken] first read the letter aloud at breakfast downstairs; &#x00026; then in the evening I had to read it again to the whole household.&#x0201D;</note>
 We rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> yesterday the Proof Slips,&#x02014; not much misprinted (<hi rend="italic">points</hi>, capitals &#x00026;c considerably jumbled, but hardly above one real <hi rend="italic">error</hi>). The Proofs were sent away by the 5 P.M. post; and this morning Delane&#x2019;s 3 Slips, which I had requested, were punctually delivered;&#x02014;and so an <hi rend="italic">end</hi> put to this unexpectedly extensive, and altogether paltry, botheration. No, not quite an end yet!; on view of the Slips, I thought the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> itself had appeared in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> of this morning; &#x00026; sent out for a Copy on your behalf;&#x02014;Copy came; but there is nothing of the Letter there! Letter could not appear until tomorrow it would seem? Well, by way of <hi rend="italic">making</hi> an <hi rend="italic">end</hi>, I do now enclose to you one of my 3 Copies of the thing (which you need not destroy);&#x02014;said Copy you can at once read, and the <hi rend="italic">Newspaper</hi> N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> in question, if you care for it to send to Alick or the like, can be found, I suppose, in some neighbouring Shop. Enough on that thrice-beggarly concern,&#x02014;enough and ten times more than enough.&#x02014; &#x02014;</p>
<p>Has Harding&#x2019;s Letter actually come to you? I doubt, not yet; but it appears to me, there is good ground for actually expecting it soon. Frederick Chapman, on Monday last, without waiting till I put any question to him, volunteered to assure me that &#x0201C;Harding, who had just left him, meant to write, or perhaps even had written, that very night; appointing John&#x2019;s time of coming; not till after Xmas &#x00026;c &#x00026;c.&#x0201D; In short, if the matter is not still essentially certain, <pb id="pg-47-107" n="47:107"/>Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> Chapman is not only &#x0201C;flaccid&#x0201D; but altogether <hi rend="italic">made</hi> of gas; and that I really do not suppose him to be.</p>
<p>Adieu, dear Brother: I am partly out of sleep; agitated in nerves (dreadfully easy to agitate, poor Soul!) with those <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> botherations &#x00026;c &#x00026;c; and ought to go out, and profit by the nice frosty sunshine there is</p>
<p>With kind Love to all.</p>

<salute>Dear Kingsley,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your kind Note of this morning. It is very serious and true; and does for the poor old lonesome heart what one man can do for another. My comfort as to Germany, in this waste pother of the English Newspapers, is that their talk and their scribble can do nothing in the matter; that the matter depends on Bismarck and the strength of the German heart and arm,&#x02014;which I always trust will not be wanting in this great Crisis for Europe and for all the world. Considering our Newspapers merely, I rather doubt the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> may have done ill, not good; but it has relieved my own poor conscience somewhat; and that is enough.</p>
<p>The raging whirlwind of delirium that is rising about Russia<note n="1" noteref="542">The Russian minister of foreign affairs, Prince Alexander Gorchakov (<date when="1798">1798</date>&#x02013;<date when="1883">1883</date>), issued a diplomatic note, <date when="1870-11-09">9 Nov.</date>, declaring Russia&#x2019;s intention to renounce the stipulation of the Treaty of Paris, <date when="1856-03-30">30 March 1856</date>, which prevented all countries from maintaining naval forces and arsenals on the Black Sea. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> warned, <date when="1870-11-19">19 Nov.</date>, that if Russia &#x0201C;proceeds to fortify the shores of the Black Sea &#x02026; our duty &#x02026; will be painful, but it seems also clear and unavoidable.&#x0201D;</note>
 in these &#x0201C;Best Instructors&#x0201D; fills me with amazement. Determined to fight Russia when we have no Army; but one commanded by Cardwell<note n="2" noteref="543">Edward Cardwell (<date when="1813">1813</date>&#x02013;<date when="1886">86</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4620"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), sec. of state for war in Gladstone&#x2019;s cabinet <date when="1868">1868</date>&#x02013;<date when="1874">74</date>, responsible for re-organization and drastic cutting of military expenditure.</note>
 and Lord Elcho;<note n="3" noteref="544">Francis Richard Charteris (<date when="1818">1818</date>&#x02013;<date when="1914">1914</date>; see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660417-JWC-TC-01"><sic>43:201</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1866-04-17">17 April 1866</date>]</corr></ref>), Lord Elcho, M.P. for East Lothian, was highly critical of Cardwell&#x2019;s military reforms.</note>
 and for the stupid old brute of a Turk,<note n="4" noteref="545">Abd&#x000FC;laziz (<date when="1830">1830</date>&#x02013;<date when="76">76</date>), 32d sultan of the Ottoman Empire <date when="1861">1861</date>&#x02013;<date when="1876">76</date>; during the <date when="1860">1860</date>s Turkey had very good relations with both Britain and France, but after the Prussian defeat of France, <date when="1871">1871</date>, Turkey turned towards Russia for friendship.</note>
 who, if he had a wise friend in the world, would be advised by him to put himself under the protection and discipline of Russia, as the one chance he had left. The Russians would improve him, poor old <pb id="pg-47-109" n="47:109"/>Wretch,&#x02014;and if they &#x0201C;improved him off the face of the Earth,&#x0201D;<note n="5" noteref="546">TC&#x2019;s prediction for the future of African-Americans in &#x0201C;Shooting Niagara: and After?&#x0201D;; see &#x0201C;Critical and Miscellaneous Essays,&#x0201D; Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:7.</note> it would perhaps be best of all.</p>
<p>Come and see me when you are in town; let me not have seen you for the last time.<note n="6" noteref="547">Kingsley currently lived in Chester as a canon in the cathedral.

<p>Before our last post go I must send you a little word though our stock of news is intrinsically small. <hi rend="italic">Dushty&#x2019;s</hi> Letter<note n="1" noteref="549">Charles d&#x2019;Eichthal (Dushty); see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701028-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1870-10-28">28 Oct.</date></ref>. John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1870-11-13">13 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;I have also written again to Eichthal, postage being only threepence per half ounce to Munich, &#x00026; he being I know fond of letters&#x0201D;; he sent TC d&#x2019;Eichthal&#x2019;s next letter, which largely concerned newspaper articles about the war.</note>
 came on Thursday afternoon when I was out. I did not get it read till after dinner: rather an indistinct kind of <hi rend="italic">Dushty</hi> to me, though an affectionate &#x00026; honest,&#x02014;dwelling a good deal on the Newspaper rumours &#x00026; clamours. Stirlings Letter to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> I did not see or hear of;<note n="2" noteref="550">TC has misunderstood John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1870-11-23">23 Nov.</date>, in which he quoted a letter to himself from Stirling: &#x0201C;I have a letter today &#x02026; from Sir W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Stirling Maxwell, in which he speaks of sending copies in pamphlet form to you &#x00026; me&#x02014;&#x2018;much elated by your Brother&#x2019;s approbation. I have read his <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> letter with more than my usual pleasure. I am daily startled &#x00026; vexed by the kind of arguments by w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> people try to extenuate the follies &#x00026; crimes w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> have brought France to the pass she is now in &#x00026; in which&#x02014;grave as it is&#x02014;I scarcely hope to see her learn any wisdom.&#x2019;&#x0201D;</note>
 send me a copy, if you have one and I will return it after reading. His Pamphlet-Lecture on <hi rend="italic">The Two Napoleons</hi><note n="3" noteref="551">Stirling Maxwell&#x2019;s lecture (see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701112-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-11-12">12 Nov.</date></corr></ref>.) was pbd. as <hi rend="italic">The Fall of Two Empires&#x02014;<date when="1814">1814</date> and <date when="1870">1870</date>. An Address to the Stirling School of Art</hi> (Stirling, <date when="1870">1870</date>).</note>
 came to us in that shape (a yellow little Pamphlet price 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) above a week ago; and indeed I had already laid by a copy of the thing in slips.</p>
<p>We have had quite a daily jumble of Letters all week on that German-French Affair,&#x02014;making truly a much ado about nothing; for none of these <pb id="pg-47-110" n="47:110"/>missives throws any new light whatever on the matter&#x02014;and I, for one, am heartily wearied of the process; every day I hope it has ceased; but on the morrow it begins again. &#x0201C;Noisy inanity&#x0201D;<note n="4" noteref="552">See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">On Heroes</hi> 192.</note>
 that is not a pleasant element to live in; but, by the nature of the case, it must, and will, sink to zero very soon. This morning, for example, I had no Letters but one,&#x02014;evidently from a raving madman; indeed one of the strangest Letters (adoring or otherwise) that I ever received.<note n="5" noteref="553">Probably Peter Baines; Jean Aitken wrote, [<date when="1870-12-11">11 Dec.</date>]: &#x0201C;That &#x2018;Madmans&#x2019; letter w<hi rend="italic">ch</hi> you sent this day fortnight signed Peter Baines I thought might possibly be by a gealic Clergymans son of that name who lived next door to us in Comely Bank. There were 8 Miss Bains &#x00026; one brother named Peter. This &#x2018;Peter&#x2019; like his &#x2018;honourable synonume&#x2019; is a Clergyman. &#x02026; I am inclined to think they are one &#x00026; the same &#x2018;Peter&#x2019; &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">but A ken nought about it</hi>.&#x2019;&#x0201D; Jean stayed with TC and JWC, 21 Comely Bank, Edinburgh, from <date when="1827-12-05">5 Dec. 1827</date> (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271212-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:294</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-12-12">12 Dec. 1827</date></corr></ref>) until they moved to Craigenputtoch, late <date when="1828-05">May 1828</date>. Neither the Baineses nor the Carlyles were listed in the Edinburgh PO Directories of the time. They were possibly the children of Andrew Baines, minister of the United Presbyterian Church in Dunbar, E. Lothian, who fell ill, <date when="1827-06">June 1827</date>, and might have retired with family to a rented house next door to the Carlyles. Otherwise unidentified. &#x0201C;<supplied>[G]</supplied>ealic,&#x0201D; i.e., Gaelic, presumably indicated the father was from a Gaelic&#x02014;speaking area of Scotland (mainly the W coast and the Western Isles).</note>
 For your medical, philological &#x00026; philosophical study, you get a copy of it by the Book Post this day. Yesterday Mary, I believe, dispatched you a considerable lot of these noisy-inane Epistles. Today you get a selection from the remainder; and that I hope will be finis to this small affair. I have not answered, even by a word, above some 3 of them; those written in the German character I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not even read, nor need you, to whom the character is familiar, make any report of them, unless (what I don&#x2019;t expect) there be some small particle of practicality involved in so much vapour.<note n="6" noteref="554">John replied, <date when="1870-11-27">27 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;I have read your German letters, &#x00026; find none of them worth reporting. No doubt the Times letter would stir up the whole of Germany with feelings of real gratitude, but only the shallowest of Germans would find outlet for long letter on the subject.&#x0201D;</note>
</p>
<p>A more important bit of intelligence is, that John&#x2019;s Affair will now be settled, as Yes or No, in a very few days; thanks to Forster chiefly, who has returned yesterday, &#x00026; will, in the course of next week, have a few minute&#x2019;s articulate speech with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Harding,<note n="7" noteref="555">For John Aitken&#x2019;s hope of getting work with Robert Harding, see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701013-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-10-13">13 Oct.</date></corr></ref>.; for Forster&#x2019;s note, see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701112-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-11-12">12 Nov.</date></corr></ref></note>
 and bring a clear answer from him I have no doubt; which surely will be welcome to us all, whatever it may be! Privately, I have little or no doubt, nor have had, the business is intrinsically safe; but it is very tantalizing to have nothing human or intelligible to report upon it for so long.</p>

The greater the successes of Germany, the stronger became the sympathy for France, so that it was sometimes almost impossible for Bernstorff to get the real facts into the Press. All the French newspaper inventions about &#x2018;German barbarism&#x2019; were believed. The only real pleasure which Bernstorff experienced amid all the demonstrations for France was the genuine enthusiasm for German genius and the defence of the German cause, by the celebrated author, Carlyle. In the struggle against a world of prejudice, the old Germanic hero of the pen put forth his whole strength, and his words fell like a sharp sword stroke upon all the Frenchified English!&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">The Bernstorff Papers</hi> 2:293).</note>
 is naturally gratifying to me; and it acquires a double value from the cordial, polite, and emphatic manner in which your Excellency is pleased to concur in that matter. For me, the poor Service in question was, in a sense, compelled by the voice of my own Conscience, and if it can anywhere do any good at all, I am more than rewarded. My persuasion is, withal, that whatever our newspapers may say, the great body of solid English Opinion on the subject is in agreement with my own.</p>

 lay waiting me, bringing home to one&#x2019;s very sight as it were, as well as to one&#x2019;s heart the Fact that had befallen&#x02014;</p>
<p>We shall all soon follow Him, especially I soon must into that undiscovered country from which there is no return.<note n="2" noteref="572">Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 3.1.</note>
 I feel to have lost one of the truest hearted Friends I ever had, the like of whom I had not now left, or shall ever see again; a man of sterling probity in its gentlest shape&#x02014; Seldom have I known a human soul gravitating more steadily towards the true &#x00026; good in all things Telos, Telos [the end]! Our thoughts on it ought rather to be silent; but may well be sad solemn &#x00026; even devout. His end was peaceful &#x00026; gentle even as his Life had been blameless quietly manful and noble.</p>
<p>I venture no word to the Bereaved ones<note n="3" noteref="573">Spedding&#x2019;s wife and family.</note>
 he has left, at Mirehouse.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have received your beautiful Volume,<note n="1" noteref="575">William Bathgate, <hi rend="italic">Christ and Man</hi> (<date when="1865">1865</date>); Bathgate wrote, <date when="1870-11-24">24 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;I muster courage to send the accompanying volume,&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">Christ and Man</hi>,&#x02014;which indeed I may say has been lying beside me these five years waiting to be sent to you.&#x0201D;</note> and, along with it a Letter full of the friendliest feelings towards me, which, though immensely exaggerated, are evidently altogether loyal and sincere.<note n="2" noteref="576">Bathgate wrote: &#x0201C;I cannot tell you how often during the past quarter of a century I have been on the eve of expressing to you my profound gratitude for good &#x00026; mighty influence derived from your writings. Whenever I see anything new from your pen the old desire revives within me, &#x00026; I dare say it is your recent letter on the Franco-German war which induces me to delay no longer the gratification of my own heart at least. No other writer, ancient or modern, outside the &#x2018;Sacred Scriptures,&#x2019; has influenced my spiritual life &#x00026; being as you have done.&#x0201D;</note> The sight of so much generous affection, of which I myself know well enough the beauty to the <hi rend="italic">Giver</hi> as well as to the Receiver cannot be other than welcome to me; and I sincerely thank you for it, and beg from you a continuance of the same.</p>
<p>I have not yet had time to examine the Book as it deserves; but in glancing over it, I find the evident traces of a cultivated, meditative, intelligent and pious man, well worthy of further study; and I think I can assure you that this Copy will have its farther uses, and not be thrown away. I return you many thanks, and wish you heartily all manner of good.<note n="3" noteref="577">TC apparently sent Bathgate a photograph with this letter, as Bathgate replied, <date when="1870-12-07">7 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;My heart will not rest till I have cordially thanked you both for your letter and photograph. The letter is everything I could have desired. It gladdens me very much to be thoroughly understood by you, and to have my sincere tribute sincerely accepted. / Many thanks for the likeness with the name written by the hand that has done so much honest work. I had other likenesses of you taken at earlier dates; but I will look all the oftener at this one, because the expression indicates at once the lateness of the evening and the heaviness of the long day&#x2019;s toil.&#x0201D; For a photograph of TC taken around this time by John and Charles Watkins, see <sic>opp.</sic><corr>above.</corr></note></p>

<salute>Dear Miss Wellmer,</salute>
<p>On Thursday night my Uncle (M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle) received a long pleasant and kind Letter from you for which he bids me write to thank you. I daresay you will have forgotten about me; but I remember writing a Letter to you about 2 years ago<note n="1" noteref="580">Mary Aitken wrote to Meta Wellmer at TC&#x2019;s request, <date when="1868-12">Dec. 1868</date>; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681203-MAI-MEW-01"><sic>45:207</sic><corr>MAI to MEW, <date when="1868-12-03">3 Dec. 1868</date></corr></ref>.</note> while you were in Paris &#x00026; receiving a very interesting answer from you. I am to tell you also that after much delay your little Book on N&#x000FC;rnberg<note n="2" noteref="581">Unidentified further.</note>
 came to him &#x00026; he read it with much pleasure &#x00026; interest and he says if you are again writing anything of the same kind, he would be very glad to see it.<note n="3" noteref="582">Wellmer sent them her article &#x0201C;Erinnerungen an Pater Hyacinthe [Memories of Father Hyacinthe]&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">N&#x000FC;rnberger Tagblatt</hi>, <date when="1869">1869</date>); Mary Aitken wrote thanking her, <date when="1871-01-05">5 Jan. 1871</date>: &#x0201C;We read your article on P&#x000E8;re Hyacinthe and thought it very good&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. <date when="9207">9207</date>). Charles Jean Marie Loyson (<date when="1827">1827</date>&#x02013;<date when="1912">1912</date>), known as P&#x000E8;re Hyacinthe, French preacher and theologian; his preaching against abuses in the Roman Catholic Church had led to his excommunication <date when="1869">1869</date>.</note> He sends you many kind wishes; &#x00026; best thanks for your kind remembrance of him.</p>
<p>Your picture of the people weeping and sobbing in the little Village Church is very touching. It is a barbarous cruel War indeed &#x00026; one longs that it were all ended! Poor foolish France I am very sorry to think of her&#x02014;not because, as my Uncle says, pity is cheap; but because she is so childish &#x00026; foolish that she seems incapable of ever learning her Lesson &#x00026; she has only fools &#x00026; dishonest untruthful men for her Leaders&#x02014;and her &#x0201C;Honor&#x0201D; which they are for ever prating about is lying sunk in the mud &#x00026; has been indeed long before this last folly of theirs was begun. I think every Prussian must be proud to belong to such a country. We in England have little to be proud of in our Government at present! The principal men in it are vulgar wealthy money-loving people.</p>
<p>It is rather strange that you should have been living in Baron Usedom&#x2019;s family&#x02014; My Uncle used to know him and I think has been in his House.<note n="4" noteref="583">Count Karl Georg Guido Ludwig von Usedom (<date when="1805">1805</date>&#x02013;<date when="84">84</date>), Prussian diplomat; see <ref target="volume-34/ed-34-biographical-notes"><sic>34:282</sic></ref>; TC had visited him at his home in Carzitz, Isle of R&#x000FC;gen, <date when="1853-08-26">26 Aug.</date>&#x02013;<date when="1858-09-03">3 Sept. 1858</date>; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580827-TC-JWC-01"><sic>34:159</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1858-08-27">27 Aug. 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x02014;</p>
<p>My Uncle is I think as well this year as he was last. He has had, like most people who have lived long in the world, to lose many Friends&#x02014;especially within the last two years&#x02014; I think he sometimes feels the world rather empty for him now, though he has still many kind and dear Friends left with him. I came from Scotland with him more than two years ago to pay a little visit to <pb id="pg-47-117" n="47:117"/>him and I have stayed with him ever since &#x00026; am able to be useful to him in many little ways. I write nearly everything for him now at his dictation, as his hand shakes a good deal &#x00026; makes writing very unpleasant for him. I am his sister&#x2019;s daughter and am 22 years old (but I may here tell you not only am I not a &#x0201C;Girl of the Period&#x0201D; but I have a great horror of that phenomenon!);<note n="5" noteref="584">The phrase comes from &#x0201C;The Girl of the Period,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Saturday Review</hi>, <date when="1868-03-14">14 March 1868</date>, written by Eliza Lynn Linton (<date when="1822">1822</date>&#x02013;<date when="1898">98</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16742"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), writer; initially a promoter of women&#x2019;s rights, she became an antifeminist campaigner. She wrote: &#x0201C;The girl of the period is a creature who dyes her hair and paints her face &#x02026; whose sole idea of life is fun; whose sole aim is unbounded luxury; and whose dress is the chief object of such thought and intellect as she possesses&#x0201D; (2).</note> and I consider it a great privilege and honour to be with my Uncle. When you have time, he would like if you sent a photograph of yourself&#x02014;I was going to send you one of his but he thinks you already have one&#x02014;for he would like to see it.</p>
<p>I was able to read all your Letter; but though I like German better than any other study I ever had I am not able to read or write it fluently.</p>
<p>With my Uncle&#x2019;s best wishes and my own, Believe me Dear Madam</p>

<salute>My dear Brother</salute>
<p>The clippings from the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> which came yesterday morning are of very superior quality; and give a clear synopsis of the French-German History of Alsace and Lorraine,&#x02014;Elsass &#x00026; Lothrigen,<note n="1" noteref="587">Elsass, German for Alsace, and Lothringen, German for Lorraine; see TC to the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1870-11-11">11 Nov.</date></note>
 as I perceive the Germans have all begun to write them again. I cannot fancy what Edinburgh person can have written those two papers, or have known half so much of exact and clear on the subject.<note n="2" noteref="588">The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> editorial, <date when="1870-11-24">24 Nov.</date>, began: &#x0201C;The question &#x2018;How did Alsace and Lorraine become French?&#x2019; was touched upon, along with many other questions in Mr Carlyle&#x2019;s recent characteristic letter. But it admits of and merits a fuller and more categorical answer, to attain which it is necessary to go a good way back and see how, first of all, Alsace and Lorraine became German.&#x0201D; The article gave a history of the provinces from the fifth century, the conquest of Gaul by Germanic tribes up to the 16th century, and the wars between France and the Holy Roman Empire. The history was continued, <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> <date when="1870-12-01">1 Dec.</date>, up to the present conflict, concluding: &#x0201C;Whether the Germans would be doing a wise thing in taking back this once German land &#x02026; it is not within our scope to discuss. But in the question of their right, as between them and the French nation, to claim the restitution, it seems to us that nothing more is required than to read the history of the case, to feel that the verdict must be in favour of the Germans.&#x0201D;</note>
 Could it be Stirling of Kier,<note n="3" noteref="589">Sir William Stirling Maxwell of Keir; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701112-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-11-12">12 Nov.</date></corr></ref>. Mary Aitken misspelled &#x0201C;Keir.&#x0201D;</note> do you imagine? I can guess <pb id="pg-47-118" n="47:118"/>no other person of the least likelihood. I have stuck the papers together (drying on the Fender at this moment), and will lay them by in a compendious and labelled condition.</p>
<p>Wednesday last the Harding document did actually come to Dumfries; but does not seem to have been at once understood there: Jean seems rather to think it a polite flying-off into space than an actual performance of what Chapman has so long been promising in Mr Harding&#x2019;s name. There is no doubt John actually stands at the top of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Harding&#x2019;s List, and will be the first new Clerk he appoints, if John is ready.<note n="4" noteref="590">John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1870-12-07">7 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Harding&#x2019;s having placed his name at the head of his list may I suppose be relied on, though in this part of the country his last note would be considered as nothing more than a civil refusal. &#x02026; Neither Jean nor James can know how to decide in such a case, for London ways differ much from those of Dumfries.&#x0201D;</note>
 He keeps, as I understand, 52 Clerks, promotes them according to merit &#x00026; seniority and rises as high as &#x000A3;400 &#x00026; &#x000A3;500. The question now is what John has to do in regard to &#x0201C;lying Jamie&#x0201D;<note n="5" noteref="591">Presumably James Gordon; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701013-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-10-13">13 Oct.</date></corr></ref></note>
 and his engagement first of all. I should be inclined to give <hi rend="italic">it</hi> up with the least possible delay, and to prepare myself with d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> &#x00026; with all industry in &#x0201C;Bookkeeping by Double Entry&#x0201D;<note n="6" noteref="592">John replied, <date when="1870-12-07">7 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;It is my opinion too that he ought to resign his place in the bank without delay; but he tells me he &#x02026; could get free at any time by a single week&#x2019;s warning.&#x0201D; Jean Aitken wrote, [<date when="1870-12-11">11 Dec.</date>]: &#x0201C;Jack is shy and backward to a fault, but if we c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> only get him farely started, he has both perseverance &#x00026; ingenuity &#x00026; I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have no fear of his doing well.&#x0201D;</note> &#x00026;c against the summons that is likely to come early in the year; but in regard to all that matter I must profess myself entirely incompetent to advise; and should think his best adviser, after those of you immediately about him might be his Brother James in Liverpool;<note n="7" noteref="593">John replied, <date when="1870-12-07">7 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;John says he generally gets no satisfactory help or advice from Jem &#x02026; &#x00026; therefore has asked none in regard to giving up his present work.&#x0201D;</note> and I hope we shall see it all come right after all and before very long.</p>
<p>The rain of balderdash, foreign and domestic, in regard to that <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Letter has not ceased upon me yet; but I hope is now near ceasing. This morning there came nothing upon it; but last night, by the final post, I had no fewer than 16 pieces upon it (Mary counted them), mostly clippings from the Berlin <pb id="pg-47-119" n="47:119"/>Newspapers by some distracted gomeral there. The fire is evidently the true place for such; and I design to keep you in a state of immunity from them henceforth. <hi rend="italic">The Republican</hi> sent today in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> seems to have something in it by Maccall,<note n="8" noteref="594"><hi rend="italic">The Republican</hi>, monthly journal ed. by William Maccall, <date when="1870">1870</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872">72</date>. Maccall included a poem called &#x0201C;Penitent France,&#x0201D; under which he wrote: &#x0201C;Like many others, I sympathised with Prussia till the Battle of Sedan was fought. From the moment of that momentous and desperate conflict, I have passionately yearned for French victories and Prussian defeats&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">The Republican</hi>, <date when="1870-12-01">1 Dec.</date>).

In the <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> I found nothing much worth reading, but that Article on &#x0201C;Progress&#x0201D; &#x00026; perhaps another slight piece <hi rend="italic">on Liverpool</hi> by &#x0201C;Patricius Walker&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> little Irish Allingham,<note n="9" noteref="595">For Froude&#x2019;s article, see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701126-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-11-26">26 Nov.</date></corr></ref>. William Allingham&#x2019;s article, &#x0201C;Rambles. By Patricius Walker, Esq. At Liverpool,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> (<date when="1870-12">Dec. 1870</date>) 735&#x02013;53, was primarily about the British Association Congress in Liverpool, <date when="1870-09">Sept. 1870</date> (see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700928-TC-JTY-01"><corr>TC to JTY, <date when="1870-09-28">28 Sept.</date></corr></ref>.) but also contained descriptions of the town, the terrible conditions of the working population, and an indictment of the current economic system that produced such conditions.</note>
 which however I only stepped through as with seven-leagued boots.</p>
<p>All last week I have had a kind of cold working on me; and for the last two days have been running at the nose like a town-cistern. Not yet quite well, though perhaps growing better; today, for the first time, I omitted my cold bath, and intend to watch well how that answers. Here has John&#x2019;s Letter come to Mary; which she says is all right; and so there-with I end. Sending my Love and blessing to all.</p>

<salute>Dear Blackie,</salute>
<p>Yesterday your pretty Book<note n="1" noteref="600">J. S. Blackie, <hi rend="italic">War Songs of the Germans with Historical Illustrations of the Liberation War and the Rhine Boundary Question</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1870">1870</date>).</note>
 came to hand; and I have already read the whole of it, with interest and thanks. The Songs go thundering along with a furious tramp of battle in them; and I suppose if one could <hi rend="italic">sing</hi>, would be very musical and heart-inspiring. One is glad to see the originals, too, so perfectly printed by your Edinburgh man. On the whole, I say &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Euge, euge</hi> [Well done, well done]&#x0201D;;&#x02014;and especially applaud the clear and vigourous Historical Summary, which will be instructive to so many dark people here at home.</p>
<p>As for the Dedication and Ms. Inscription, what can I say but drop a veil over my blushing face and answer by expressive silence!<note n="2" noteref="601">Blackie wrote in the dedication to TC, dated <date when="1870-11-23">23 Nov. 1870</date>: &#x0201C;<supplied>[I]</supplied>n two points I have always felt that we are at one&#x02014;in a stern love of justice, and a hearty detestation of all sickly sentiment. From these two fundamental instincts it has no doubt arisen, that on the subject of the political relations between France and Germany for the last four hundred years, we have arrived &#x02026; at precisely the same conclusion. It was therefore with peculiar pleasure that I received your kind permission to grace with your name the three chapters in prose and verse which I here put forth on this important theme. &#x02026; May you long continue to hold forth in your life and writings, to all English-speaking men, a noble example of that manly independence, lofty fervour, and unbribed truthfulness, without which the greatest literary successes are mere painted flowers&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">War Songs</hi> v&#x02014;&#x173;vi).</note>
</p>
<p>Good be with you always, dear Blackie. With many thanks, I am ever</p>

<p><pb id="pg-47-122" n="47:122"/>As to the Philanthropy <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> Justice, I have myself no difficulty; being deeply aware that <hi rend="italic">Justice is the Soul of this Universe</hi>,<note n="2" noteref="604">Cf. <hi rend="italic">The Sufistic Quatrains of Omar Khayyam</hi>, quatrain 328.</note> <hi rend="italic">and that against Justice nothing whatever will have weight</hi>. Woe to the People, woe to the Man that imagines he can caudle [mix] right and wrong together, and make up for want of Justice by abundance of miserable Pity for the Criminal who requires it of us! The like of that in our England, I have looked at for the last 40 years, with more and more aversion, growing gradually into ominous foreboding and, of late, I may say into silent anger and even abhorrence. Needing to be kept strictly silent in the present humour of the world! But it seems to me the evident preliminary of universal downbreak into slush and mud. <hi rend="italic">Justice is eternally the Soul of the Universe</hi>; and it is not always a soft or pleasant thing, it is oftenest a stern and severe. But there has never been any Succedaneum found for it; nor will, or can ever be. That I for myself consider certain though it should have grown doubtful to all the Able-Editors &#x00026; Stump Orators in this world.<note n="3" noteref="605">Dixon commented on TC&#x2019;s letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on the Franco-Prussian War: &#x0201C;The truthful exposition of matters Historical none can deny. Yet ones Christian feeling somehow is put to the test, at its awful rigid justice upon France. &#x02026; how to reconcile Christian Mercy, with such stern Jewish Law, is to me the task of our Age. &#x02026; Jewish Law or Christian Mercy and forgiveness for sin or Crime.&#x0201D;</note></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">M</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Park</hi> tells a dismal story about Ballot-boxing<note n="4" noteref="606">Dixon wrote: &#x0201C;Herewith I enclose you a letter cut from the &#x2018;Victorian&#x2019; bearing out your utterances upon the matter of universal suffrage, or the Benifits to Peoples by Ballot Boxes.&#x0201D; Mr. Park and letter untraced, presumably pbd. in <hi rend="italic">The Victoria Magazine</hi>, monthly periodical, <date when="1863">1863</date>&#x02013;<date when="1880">80</date>, ed.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Two nights ago there came to this door a weighty Volume;<note n="1" noteref="608">Samuel Carter Hall, <hi rend="italic">A Book of Memories of Great Men and Women of the Age from Personal Acquaintance</hi> (<date when="1871">1871</date>); it included biographical portraits of many of TC&#x2019;s friends and acquaintances. Its title page included the first few phrases of Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">On Heroes</hi>.</note>
 which on opening it proved to be a splendidly beautiful one as well; and a most kind and welcome Gift due to your friendly regard. I have spent all my leisure ever since on the Book; and find it altogether excellent reading, full of matter strangely interesting to me. Several of the Pieces I had read before; these also I have read again in their revised form; in fact I read all,&#x02014;and only regret to think I shall probably end it this night. How strange, how grand and tragical, those silent photograph-shadows of the past, which were once living Figures along with us, in the loud-roaring present, and whom we are so soon to join! You have done your work with insight, equity and charity. The Book will be a cheering guest at many Christmas firesides this year; and may promise itself a lasting use to this, and the coming generations. Many thanks, many thanks.</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your two Letters. I am sorry you have still your cold hanging about you; though I hope you are nursing it well and that it will soon go altogether. As for mine, it considerably abated after those two days of copious <hi rend="italic">sniftering</hi>, wh. I suppose were remedial to it; and now I have nothing left of the affair, except perhaps some trifling feeling in the bones, and a dirty aching in one side of the upper jaw, the like of wh. I used to have in the dark <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> seasons; but which is new again this winter. Our weather seems to be as bad as yours or worse, except perhaps in point of black frost. We had two days of that this week, &#x00026; ever since, a puddle of darkness rainy snow and mud,&#x02014;yesterday gradually about two inches of snow covering all things; &#x00026; in spite of all the sloppy thawing, still near an inch of it left:<note n="1" noteref="611">The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported the heavy fall of snow, <date when="1870-12-10">10 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;Although the glass stood at freezing point during the day the streets were wretchedly sloppy, but in the suburbs and the parks the snow lay firm and hard.&#x0201D;</note> I get through it better can could be expected; omit bathing when the mornings are very cold; one morning omitted going out altogether; button on soft warm coat (not yet quite my warmest), soft cape above that surmounted by a horse collar of comforter wool, with soft hat drawn down as far as it will go; &#x00026; step out deliberately, defiant of the weather. I really much wish I could persuade you to a Cape exactly like my own: Jean could at once get it you, and have it lined with some soft satiny like thing,<note n="2" noteref="612">Jean Aitken sent TC a cape, <date when="1865-12">Dec. 1865</date>, made by William Boyd (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x02013;<date when="90">90</date>), Cummertrees tailor; see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18651225-TC-JCA-01"><sic>43:84</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1865-12-25">25 Dec. 1865</date></corr></ref>; for a picture of TC wearing the cape, see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660412-JWC-TC-01"><sic>43:181</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1866-04-12">12 April 1866</date>]</corr></ref>.

 and to have it reach to the knee,&#x02014;of that <hi rend="italic">same</hi> flexible brownish-grey cloth. You have no idea how much comfort is in it in windy snowing dirty weather.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your solidly intelligent and obliging Letter can not be other than gratifying to me; and I return you many thanks for the satisfaction it gave.</p>
<p>According to all the evidence I have or can gather from the rational people I speak with, I believe I can assure you that the real opinion of silent England is much the reverse of that given out in Newspapers by the more frothy and vocal class, and that, in fact, it essentially agrees with my own, and will in the end, as you anticipate openly coincide with it. Certain it is, the conduct of our Government in allowing France to supply itself with Arms from England has excited the surprise regret and disapproval of all or nearly all the considerate and just-minded men whom I have met with; and almost nobody <hi rend="italic">but</hi> the Newspaper Editors appears to think our Foreign Secretary&#x2019;s arguments<note n="1" noteref="622">George Leveson-Gower, 2d Earl Granville, foreign sec. from <date when="1870-07">July 1870</date> until <date when="1874-02">Feb. 1874</date>. TC may refer to Lord Granville&#x2019;s letter to the British Ambassador in Berlin, <date when="1870-10-20">20 Oct.</date>, about Bismarck&#x2019;s manifesto issued to foreign powers, <date when="1870-10-10">10 Oct.</date>, protesting against Prussia being held responsible for any calamities that might happen if the provisional govt. of France refused to capitulate. Lord Granville explained the British govt.&#x2019;s efforts to secure an armistice, arguing: &#x0201C;<supplied>[T]</supplied>he probability of a new and irreconcilable war must be greatly increased if a generation of Frenchmen behold the spectacle of the destruction of a capital&#x02014;a spectacle connected with the death of great masses of helpless and unarmed persons, with the destruction of treasures of art, science, and historical reminiscences which are of inestimable value and cannot be replaced. Such a catastrophe would be terrible for France, and dangerous, as I believe, for the future peace of Europe&#x0201D;; Bismarck replied that &#x0201C;English mediation was being misunderstood in Paris and encouraging further resistance&#x0201D; (Joseph Irving, <hi rend="italic">Annals of our Time &#x02026; <date when="1837">1837</date> &#x02026; 1871</hi> [<date when="1890">1890</date>] 954&#x02013;<date when="55">55</date>).</note>
 altogether satisfactory. My own guess is, our Government, which, at any rate, delights in <hi rend="italic">governing</hi> as little as possible, is in this instance mindful of its Alabama quarrel with America;<note n="2" noteref="623">The <hi rend="italic">Alabama</hi> was a ship built in Britain for the Confederate States, <date when="1862">1862</date>; this was seen by some as a breach of neutrality, and at the end of the Civil War the U.S. government demanded compensation; the consequent row continued until referred to international arbitration, <date when="1871">1871</date>, both Granville and Gladstone believing that a code of international law, and friendly relations with the U.S., were of paramount importance. The decision, <date when="1872">1872</date>, that Britain should pay &#x000A3;300,000 was unpopular.</note>
 and hopes to establish some entirely nugatory principle of contraband, and law of neutrality between Nations, which may, at whatever cost otherwise, help it over that and similar difficulties. Actual Members of the Government known to me are in private very friendly to Germany;&#x02014;and as to the Newspaper Editors, I fear they are in general of <pb id="pg-47-127" n="47:127"/>another than serious type, and address, not the worthiest or weightiest classes in England, but the most numerous, who can buy their papers to the greatest extent. One has at all times to appeal steadily from that kind of &#x0201C;Philip&#x0201D; to a Philip that is &#x0201C;sober,&#x0201D; or at least soberer!<note n="3" noteref="624">TC refers to the story told of Philip II of Macedon (see TC to ed. of <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1870-11-11">11 Nov.</date>), when a woman wrongly convicted declared she would appeal to Philip sober against the decision made by Philip drunk; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350203-TC-RWE-01"><sic>8:40</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1835-02-03">3 Feb. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note>
</p>
<p>I fully participate in all your wishes and anticipations, both for the victorious end of this great controversy with infatuated France, and for the clearer and clearer understanding of one another by our two Nations, which are indeed Brothers both in blood and in spirit if they understood one another.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The Letter I got from you yesterday was not for me at all; on opening the cover, it at once addressed Douglas the Bookseller!<note n="1" noteref="626">John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1870-12-18">18 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;I did intend to write to you on Thursday last, &#x00026; had a cover addressed for that purpose,&#x02014;as well as one for Mr Douglas which I find still here in my portfolio! &#x02026; I must have put the letter to D. into the wrong cover! I am sorry for the mistake as it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> annoy you not a little.&#x0201D; David Douglas (<date when="1823">1823</date>&#x02013;<date when="1916">1916</date>), Scottish publisher, of Edmonston &#x00026; Douglas, Edinburgh; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18670921-TC-JAC-01"><sic>45:32</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1867-09-21">21 Sept. 1867</date></corr></ref> where wrongly identified as George Douglas.</note> After an hour&#x2019;s consideration, we dispatched it to the Owner, asking in return If <hi rend="italic">he</hi> hadn&#x2019;t got a Letter for me? Nothing of that kind has come this morning, nor can now till Monday.<note n="2" noteref="627">TC was writing on Sat., and there were no postal deliveries from Scotland on Sundays.</note> I suppose there was nothing pressing or of importance in it; and that the fact of your putting the two Letters each into the <hi rend="italic">other&#x2019;s</hi> cover was evidence of that.<note n="3" noteref="628">John wrote: &#x0201C;Jean had received a rather vehement letter from Jem about John&#x2019;s business, &#x00026; we had talked a good deal about it &#x00026; got somewhat agitated &#x00026; confused, so that I thought it better not to write to you till I had fully considered the subject, as I have now done since Thursday night. Jean still thinks Mr Harding&#x2019;s second letter, about having &#x2018;placed John&#x2019;s name at the head of his list of candidates for employment,&#x2019; meant nothing in reality. &#x02026; <supplied>[W]</supplied>hen Jem first went to Liverpool he had good introductions to some of the most respectable houses, &#x00026; had his &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">name put at the head of some</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">ten</hi> <hi rend="italic">lists</hi>&#x2019; &#x00026; got nothing thereby except the sorest disappointments &#x00026; vexations. &#x02026; He therefore strongly advises John not to give up his present situation. &#x02026; Harding &#x02026; is known to some of his acquaintances in Liverpool &#x00026; probably has the same method of putting candidates &#x2018;at the head of his list&#x2019; when he wants to be rid of them.&#x0201D;</note> This morning Mary has a Letter from one of her Cousins in Canada;<note n="4" noteref="629">From either one of Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s or Janet Hanning&#x2019;s children.</note> <pb id="pg-47-128" n="47:128"/>which I enclose: it is the only thing worth sending you,&#x02014;unless perhaps the (emptyish) <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> of this morning, for behoof of Craigenputtock Jamie, whose <hi rend="italic">Public Opinion</hi> has not come to hand?</p>
<p>We are in an utter drench of tepid rain and mud; swallowed in fact in the Gulf-Stream vapours;&#x02014;which has at last grown one of the intolerablest elements to live in. Fitter for a duck or a fish, at lowest, for a frog, than for a man. The fall of actual rain is great, and though fitful, hardly ever altogether ceasing; add the darkness, the liquid <hi rend="italic">glar</hi> of the roadways, &#x00026; the roaring torrent of wheels:&#x02014;coming up to Hyde-Park Corner yesterday along with Tait, I was tempted to ejaculate, looking into Piccadilly &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Per me si va n&#x000E9;lla citt&#x000E0; dolente, Per me</hi> [Through me you enter the city of woe, through me]&#x0201D;<note n="5" noteref="630">Cf. Dante, <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi>, canto 3, &#x0201C;The Gate of Hell.&#x0201D;</note>&#x02014;&#x00026;c! It does not well agree with my poor skin &#x00026; stomach; but, except that pitiful continual toothache, I have no <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>, nor other unusual suffering. I do begin, however, to feel that plunging out into the rain, &#x00026; walking <hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi> [at will] in Mackintosh &#x00026; Wide-awake, is a thing I must avoid. Yesternight, learning by the experience of the night before, I didn&#x2019;t go out at all,&#x02014;nor suffer specially from it.</p>
<p>Of news we have nothing; the black plunge has even kept visitors for most part away from us; and the Newspaper <hi rend="italic">Placards</hi> (top of Oakley St.) every morning have indicated sufficiently, for a month past that the paper itself is not <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> a penny. I am able for no work. I read with relief any Book that has a modicum of sense in it, which a good many that I try have not: last week I read an authentic, but very dim straggly foreign kind of Book, <hi rend="italic">Life of B&#x00113;thoven</hi> by one Schindler;<note n="6" noteref="631">Anton Schindler, <hi rend="italic">Biographie von Ludwig van Beethoven</hi> (M&#x000FC;nster, <date when="1840">1840</date>).

 sincere Book, but mostly floating invisible to me in the regions of counter-point, artistic rapture &#x00026;c; &#x00026; representing to me a dreadfully violent inarticulate gnarl of a man; full of dumb fire, very dark and heavy-laden, though melodious to a degree. &#x0201C;Poor fellow after all!&#x0201D;<note n="7" noteref="632">John A.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>This is merely a word to tell you that we are going on here in the common way not a worse than usual, though the weather is for the present settled into steady frost. At a very low temperature, I nevertheless decided this morning, for valid reasons, on a bath; of course I lost not a moment; but on getting downstairs could not put in a button even in my waistcoat; and poor Mary, busy heating everything, had to do the buttoning first! Happily the Streets are all clear of snow again; and I ran out in my comfortable French shoes &#x00026; muffled to the eyes; getting a great deal of good of the 20 minutes sharp locomotion. Since which I have been quite idle; reading, sorting rubbish,&#x02014;ready now for a long walk, sun having come out &#x00026; all being hard &#x00026; calm.</p>
<p>Yesterday I sent the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> a bit of German &#x00026; of Scotsman Newspaper along with a Book about Paris which you may tell him more expressly to keep for me.

<p><salute>Dear Sir,&#x02014;</salute>Three nights ago there came to me from Dresden a beautiful little blue book, &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Die tausendj&#x000E4;hrige Eiche im Elsass</hi>,&#x0201D;<note n="1" noteref="646">Robert Waldm&#x000FC;ller, <hi rend="italic">Die tausendj&#x000E4;hrige Eiche im Elsass</hi> [The Millennium Oak in Alsace] (Berlin, <date when="1870">1870</date>).</note>
 which&#x02014;especially as coupled with your kind inscription on the cover of it, bearing date &#x0201C;vor [in front of] Paris&#x0201D;I read with very great interest. It is in itself truly a beautiful little book, put together with a great deal of art, and betokening in the writer a delicate, affectionate, poetic, and gifted human brother, well skilled in literary composition&#x02014;not to speak of still higher things. Nowhere have I seen a more ingenious arrangement of whatever was bright and human in an antiquarian study into a really living and artistic form than this of Elsass and its &#x0201C;Thousand Years&#x2019; Oak!&#x0201D;<note n="2" noteref="647">TC wrote, <date when="1871-01-13">13 Jan. 1871</date>: &#x0201C;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Thousand-Years Oak in Elsass</hi>&#x2019; (Berlin <date when="1870">1870</date>), title of a pretty enough little Book, w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> came to me, inscribed <hi rend="italic">der Freunde Deutschl</hi>d <hi rend="italic">&#x00026;c</hi>, from the Lines &#x2018;before Paris,&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">Note</hi>; w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has now (yest<hi rend="italic">y</hi> <date when="1871-01-12">12 jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1871</date>) come back in the <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> form; Hooh, hooh, miserable penny-a-liners!&#x0201D; (TC&#x2019;s journal, <date when="1871-01-13">13 Jan. 1871</date>; privately owned). The <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> introduced TC&#x2019;s letter: &#x0201C;Our Special Correspondent with the Headquarters of the Crown Prince of Saxony, writing from Ville Evrart on the 7th, says: &#x2018;Thomas Carlyle on the foreposts! The &#x0201C;sage of Chelsea,&#x0201D; as the penny-a-liners delight to call him, among the besiegers of Paris! Yes, verily, not indeed in the actual flesh; and Scotch plaid, but represented by certain written words, the authorship of which no one could doubt, even if he were not familiar with the handwriting. In the German armies are many who know how to wield the pen as well as the sword. One of these ambidextrous men now in the Saxon Army before Paris here had sent a little book of his to Chelsea, sure that the matter of it would find sympathy there, and as I rode yesterday through the village in which Herr Waldm&#x000FC;ller is quartered he brought me the letter which Mr. Carlyle had sent him in acknowledgment. With the permission of the recipient I transcribed it, and here is the copy.&#x2019;&#x0201D; Frederick Augustus Albert (<date when="1828">1828</date>&#x02013;<date when="1902">1902</date>), crown prince of Saxony.</note>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday at two o&#x2019;clock came your Letter; which, and the various details in it, I was thankful to read. Very likely your proposed journey to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> may be of real use to you;<note n="1" noteref="655">John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1870-12-29">29 Dec.</date>, that he might go to Edinburgh &#x0201C;for a week or two. My old lodgings (Orrocks, 73 George Street) happen to be vacant, &#x00026; perhaps the change may be beneficial. The distance is short, &#x00026; my room upstairs here is very cold in the frosty weather.&#x0201D; Agnes Orrock (b. <date when="1817">1817</date>) and her sister Elizabeth (b. <date when="1819">1819</date>), lodging house keepers, 73 George St., Edinburgh; John had lodged with them for many years; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650725-TC-JAC-01"><sic>42:147</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1865-07-25">25 July 1865</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 the breaking up of one&#x2019;s old habits for a time is generally helpful; one may suffer new ways, but they are sure to be <hi rend="italic">different</hi> ways and, as I sometimes say to rub on new places of the skin. The cold &#x00026; the solitude you justly complain of will at least be remedied; as to the former sore point, I know well how miserable it is; and I must again give you an advice upon it, supplementary to the Cape<note n="2" noteref="656">See <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701210-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-12-10">10 Dec.</date></corr></ref></note> which you at length did me the real pleasure to <pb id="pg-47-134" n="47:134"/>follow. You absolutely must provide yourself with a pair of new flannel Shirts. You have no idea of the increase of heat that will surprise you in them; at y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> time of life, I reckon it quite unwise to be without them. Do think of this I beg of you! Jean can get you in a couple of days a completely excellent pair; &#x00026; I am altogether mistaken if, in the course of the first week, or even of the first day, you do not recognise them as real new friends. I that testify have worn them for about 50 years; again therefore I say <hi rend="italic">Experto crede</hi> [trust the expert]. You could also have <hi rend="italic">sleeved</hi> waistcoats buttoning to the throat; in fact there are many increments of heat still at hand for you in improvements of costume. Don&#x2019;t, I pray you don&#x2019;t, neglect them any more.</p>
<p>Today there comes a <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> with a Letter from Lord Neaves enclosed;<note n="3" noteref="657">Charles Neaves (<date when="1800">1800</date>&#x02013;<date when="1876">76</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19836"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Scottish judge, lord of justiciary, <date when="1858">1858</date>&#x02013;<date when="1876">76</date>, and rector of the Univ. of St. Andrews, <date when="1872">1872</date>&#x02013;<date when="1874">74</date>.

I have not yet answered Lord Neaves; but intend to have a word ready for him on Monday morning. He is a man of sense; and seems to have more of seriousness and affection in him that I had judged by what I saw. If you meet him in Edinburgh, you can also verbally assure him of my esteem. There is farther waiting for you an astonishing Paper by Ruskin;<note n="4" noteref="658">Probably Ruskin&#x2019;s &#x0201C;Looking Down from Ingleborough,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera: Letters to the Workmen and Labourers of Great Britain</hi> (<date when="1871">1871</date>&#x02013;<date when="84">84</date>), Letter 1. John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1871-01-06">6 Jan. 1871</date>: &#x0201C;Ruskin&#x2019;s mad pamphlet came yesterday. He is a man of very weak intellect, &#x00026; anything he says will produce small effect on people who have any knowledge.&#x0201D; However, TC expressed admiration to Ruskin for his Letter 5 of <hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi>; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710430-TC-JRU-01"><corr>TC to JRU, <date when="1871-04-30">30 April 1871</date></corr></ref>.</note> but that shall reserve itself for saluting you in Edinburgh. Quietly I think you never read a madder looking thing; I still hope (though with little confidence) that he will bethink him and drop the matter in time: therefore keep it to yourself in the meanwhile,&#x02014;though, alas, I fear he will plunge into it all the same. Last night he was here, he and two extremely insipid young women;<note n="5" noteref="659">Ruskin wrote to Mary Aitken, <date when="1870-12-27">27 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;I am so glad of your kind note. &#x02026; I shall gratefully bring Joanna with me on Friday evening&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 555.<date when="47">47</date>). Ruskin&#x2019;s cousin Joan Agnew; the other young woman was possibly Constance Hilliard (see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701013-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-10-13">13 Oct.</date></corr></ref>), otherwise unidentified.</note>
 but the result to me was mostly zero or at least considerable <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> quantities,&#x02014;among others loss of a portion of my sleep in the vile cold night it was! For the last fortnight there have been considerable interruptions in that important particular; due mostly to well-intentioned visits and to small mistakes of my own; but I generally make out what the error has been and decide upon more caution and ever more. On the whole there can be nothing but a struggle till this fierce weather pass; <pb id="pg-47-135" n="47:135"/>but it, too, will pass. For the last three days I have had no washing except of face &#x00026; hands in tepid water &#x00026; I never try to go out except all muffled up, and during the two lucid hours of the day. These changes are real losses to me; but one must put up with them for fear of far worse. Essentially I have nothing to complain of except what belongs to the years I have come to.</p>
<p>Here has come your Letter of yesterday; I keep the Canada Letter<note n="6" noteref="660">John A. Carlyle forwarded, <date when="1870-12-30">30 Dec.</date>, the letter from Canada sent to their nephew John. In his letter of <date when="1870-12-29">29 Dec.</date>, John gave TC some of the news: &#x0201C;John had a longish letter last night from his cousin Alick. &#x02026; It gives details about the whole family by name, Father &#x00026; Mother are &#x2018;both very well considering their age.[&#x2019;] Uncle John [their half-brother] had just spent a day at Bield, looked older, but was very cheerful, never stays a night from home &#x2018;canna sleep at a&#x2019; except in his ain bed&#x2019;; still works diligently &#x00026; is well off tho&#x2019; entirely alone in his house.

Jane has had hers thoroughly repaired, has two sons who assist her well in the farming, &#x00026; she looks more cheerful in spite of her husband&#x2019;s continued fits of epilepsy.

John has bought himself a house in Brantford &#x00026; intends working as a carpenter. It was he who was a cavalry sergeant &#x00026; had a dollar per day. He &#x00026; young Alick planned Tom&#x2019;s new house &#x00026; seem to have done all the carpentry of it.&#x0201D;</note> till we get it deliberately read. Mary and I send our regards to Jim, who will be a new light in the household at this dim season;<note n="7" noteref="661">Their nephew James Aitken was spending the New Year with his family.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>Though in great haste today, with proof-sheets &#x00026;c, I must write you a little word before sallying out into the frost. We have miserable continually fluctuating weather of the same kind as yours and certainly quite as bad: I am very glad to hear that you stand it without damage; &#x00026; I beg you very much to be careful of yourself and avoid tumbling! I had fancied the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> people threw ashes on their streets; but seemingly they are as mad as we in that respect.<note n="1" noteref="679">John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1871-01-10">10 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;Our frosty weather still continues, with short intervals of thaw now &#x00026; then in the day time, slippery streets, sprinklings of snow &#x02026; but I &#x02026; have not yet had any fall in the streets.&#x0201D; It was against London bylaws to throw ashes into the streets to prevent accidents even in times of frost and icy pavements; see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670210-TC-JAF-01"><sic>44:151</sic><corr>TC to JAF, <date when="1867-02-10">10 Feb. 1867</date></corr></ref>.</note><pb id="pg-47-138" n="47:138"/>I for most part sleep, if not well, yet not intolerably ill &#x00026; endeavour to fence myself against the unfriendly elements till their time of departure do come.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I thank you much for the kind little note you sent me, which was deeply interesting after the sad news we had had.<note n="1" noteref="713">The death of Alexander Munro (<date when="1825">1825</date>&#x02013;<date when="1871">71</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19545"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), sculptor; he d., <date when="1871-01-01">1 Jan.</date>, in Cannes where he wintered; see also <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690428-TC-JAC-01"><sic>46:42</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1869-04-28">28 April 1869</date></corr></ref>.

<p>Beautiful and gentle, softly heroic, had the life all along been; and now at last the end has been peace. It was a wild surprise to me, some three months ago, to find on my return one evening that poor Munro had actually been at this door! I hastened out next day in search, but there was no address on the card, and I could find nothing: it was near night of the second day before I came on any clear trace; and he had sailed for Antwerp some hours before. We were not to meet again in this world. He was much loved here, and has left a pathetically beautiful remembrance with many friends. It is perhaps a still better consolation that he left his widow and children provided for, and his house well set in order.<note n="3" noteref="715">Munro m., <date when="1861">1861</date>, Mary, b.

 To such a life we can piously say well done, well done!</p>

If M. Jules Favre accepts these proposals made to him by Count Bismarck, Germany will recognize the French Republic.

&#x02014;it is the only bit of glad news I have had from these Placards for a very long time. Poor France one c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> observe all the while had, in spite of its boastings and the rumours of the Editors, no success in any enterprize whatever; &#x00026; every &#x0201C;Victory,&#x0201D; each in its turn, turned out within two days to have been a <hi rend="italic">defeat</hi> cloaked by lies and fallacious hope.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I wished to write you on Saturday; but was prevented by various paltry interruptions, such as are continually occurring here. Today also most part of my time is gone by a similar or worse process of waste! Your Letter had many interesting Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> details,&#x02014;especially that about poor Mary Welsh, whose considerable degree of recovery,<note n="1" noteref="733">Mary Welsh had become addicted to opium; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690506-TC-JAC-01"><sic>46:46&#x02013;47</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1869-05-06">6 May 1869</date></corr></ref>. John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1871-01-27">27 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;Yesterday I had a private interview with Maggie Welsh, &#x00026; she told me about her sister Mary. After spending more than a year at Bridge of Allan, boarded with a lady who undertook to keep her as much as possible from opium, her brother Alick came to see her in September last, &#x00026; found no improvement in her case; so by advice of D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Skay physician to the large Morningside Asylum here, he had her placed as I advised two years ago in the Perth Asylum where there are other ladies in a similar condition&#x02014;separate from the general patients &#x00026; with walking ground as well as apartments of their own. Jeanie (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Chrystal) [Mary and Maggie&#x2019;s sister] saw her in November &#x00026; found her greatly improved &#x00026; not at all dissatisfied, &#x00026; last month (Dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi>) Maggie saw her, was cheerfully welcomed &#x00026; spent some hours in her company. She had lost all her stoutness, become as active as she ever was, &#x00026; looked much the same as she was before she began to take any opium, &#x00026; she gets none at present, but the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at Perth thinks it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be safe to trust her alone just yet.&#x0201D; Dr. David Skae (ca. <date when="1815">1815</date>&#x02013;<date when="73">73</date>), F.R.C.S.

Patience, Patience, the end must come. Enough, enough, dear Brother.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It is with reluctance that I write anything to you on this subject of Female Emancipation which is now rising to such a height; and I do it only on the strict condition that whatever I say shall be private, and nothing of it get into the Newspapers. The truth is, the topic for five &#x00026; twenty years past, especially for the last three or four, has been a mere sorrow to me; one of the most afflicting proofs of the miserable Anarchy that prevails in human society; and I have avoided thinking of it, except when fairly compelled; what little has become clear to me on it I will now endeavour to tell you.</p>
<p>In the first place, then, I have never doubted that the true and noble function of a woman in this world was, is, and forever will be, that of being Wife and Helpmate to a worthy Man; &#x00026; discharging well the duties that devolve on her in consequence as mother of children, and mistress of a Household, duties high, noble, silently important as any that can fall to a human creature: duties which, if well discharged, constitute woman, in a soft beautiful and almost sacred way, the Queen of the World, and, by her natural faculties, graces, strengths and weaknesses, are every way indicated as specifically hers. The true destiny of a Woman, therefore, is to wed a Man she can love and esteem; and to lead noiselessly, under his protection, with all the wisdom grace and heroism that is in her, the life presented in consequence.</p>
<p>It seems, furthermore indubitable that if a Woman miss this destiny, or have renounced it, she has every right, before God and man, to take up whatever honest employment she can find open to her in the world; probably there are several or many employments, now exclusively in the hands of men, for which women might be more or less fit;&#x02014;printing, tailoring, weaving, clerking &#x00026;c &#x00026;c. That Medicine is intrinsically not unfit for them is proved from the fact that in much more sound and earnest ages than ours, before the Medical Profession rose into being, they were virtually the Physicians and Surgeons as well as Sick-nurses, all that the world had. Their form of intellect, their sympathy, their wonderful acuteness of observation &#x00026;c seem to indicate in <pb id="pg-47-152" n="47:152"/>them peculiar qualities for dealing with disease; and evidently in certain departments (that of female diseases) they have quite peculiar opportunities of being useful.&#x02014; My answer to your question, then, may be that two things are not doubtful to me in this matter.</p>
<p>1&#x000B0;. That Women, any Woman who deliberately so determines, have a right to study Medicine; and that it might be profitable and serviceable to have facilities, or at least possibilities offered them for so doing.<note n="1" noteref="743">John A. Carlyle wrote from Edinburgh, <date when="1871-02-12">12 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;The question about admissions of ladies to the medical classes is much talked of, &#x00026; several meetings on the subject have been held. Of all my acquaintances amongst the professors Masson is the only one who votes for mixed classes of women &#x00026; men. &#x02026; I &#x02026; distinctly &#x00026; emphatically told him I could by no means agree with him, &#x00026; believed that the introduction of any such classes might do great injury to the university. &#x02026; One of the 7 or 8 female students is a Miss Sophia Jex Blake&#x02014;a stout, rather tall &#x00026; clever-talking lady of forty or more with large under jaw. &#x02026; I met her one day at luncheon, sat next her, found her smart &#x00026; clever, but talked little about her fixed ideas.&#x0201D; Sophia Louisa Jex-Blake (<date when="1840">1840</date>&#x02013;<date when="1912">1912</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34189"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), physician and campaigner for women&#x2019;s rights; already a qualified mathematics teacher, she applied to Edinburgh Univ. to study medicine in <date when="1869">1869</date>, but was refused on the grounds that she could not attend the men&#x2019;s classes, and it would not be practicable to hold classes for just one woman; when five women applied, they were admitted, but as lecturers were paid directly by their students, and they were so few, they were charged very high fees. By <date when="1870">1870</date> there were seven women altogether; although they all passed their examinations, the Univ. decided, <date when="1872-01">Jan. 1872</date>, that they could not be granted degrees.</note>
 But</p>
<p>2&#x000B0;. That, for obvious reasons, Female Students of Medicine ought to have, if possible Female Teachers, or else an extremely select kind of Men; and in particular that to have young Women present among young Men in Anatomical Classes, Clinical Lectures, or generally studying Medicine in concert, is an incongruity of the first magnitude; and shocking to think of to every pure and modest mind.</p>
<p>This is all I have to say; and I send it to you, under the condition above mentioned, as a Friend for the use of Friends.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Nothing has happened during this week that could much deserve record: in fact I may define myself as one that has no history at all except a passive one, or dumb struggle against the winter elements and their aggravation of <pb id="pg-47-153" n="47:153"/>the burdens inexorably due to old age and its sorrows. For the last four weeks I have at last fallen much bankrupt in regard to sleep; and am not yet in a state of safe liquidation,&#x02014;tho&#x2019; again at this date I have a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> night of tolerable sleep; and, as usual, am trying to hope for a <hi rend="italic">third</hi>, which would make things surer. Except this, which means merely weaker and weaker faculty of digestion, I have no complaint whatever; and ought to know, and partly do, that there is no room for discontent with my situation, but for much the reverse. The worst is, I have lost my right hand, and faculty of penmanship; otherwise I might have daily an interesting hour or two, which is now forbidden me. Two hours of reading in <hi rend="italic">Goethe</hi>, after tea, is fairly the best employment my day yields me,&#x02014;the rest of it a series of bothers &#x00026; futilities; without either action or discourse which can be called either genial or satisfactory. Well, Well. Let us hope the Winter is now going or gone; let us, at least, be patient, thoughtful and, so far as may be, silent.</p>
<p>The Geraldine Petition, splendidly signed (thanks to Mary&#x2019;s eminent industry),<note n="1" noteref="745">For the campaign for Geraldine Jewsbury&#x2019;s pension, see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710121-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1871-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref></note> is now out of our hands into those of Gladstone; and with it at least we have <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. Poor Forster is still coughing sadly; and much oppressed with ill-health and continual labour;&#x02014;to him also the <hi rend="italic">finale</hi> of the Geraldine affair will be a real deliverance; we went together, he and I, and solemnly delivered it to Dilke<note n="2" noteref="746">Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke (<date when="1843">1843</date>&#x02013;<date when="1911">1911</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32824"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), writer and politician; as the Liberal M.P. for Chelsea, <date when="1868">1868</date>&#x02013;<date when="1886">86</date>, he was the appropriate person to whom to deliver a petition for a constituent.</note> last Saturday; right glad both of us to wash our hands of it.</p>

For Edward Cardwell and his military reforms, see below.</note> with some appearance of real seriousness, and <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi>-penitent admission that perhaps it was too true. Forster in particular rather pleased me; had more of solidity, and less of &#x0201C;soft-soap&#x0201D; than I had expected, after his sudden rise to what is called <pb id="pg-47-154" n="47:154"/>eminence in the Parliamentary line.<note n="5" noteref="749">Forster was appointed vice-president of the council (with responsibility for education), <date when="1868-12">Dec. 1868</date>, in Gladstone&#x2019;s government; the <date when="1870">1870</date> Elementary Education Act became known as Forster&#x2019;s Act; see also <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680125-TC-RAS-01"><sic>45:90</sic><corr>TC to RAS, <date when="1868-01-25">25 Jan. 1868</date></corr></ref>.</note> There is great emotion, he told me, on the matter of Army Reform, and some other points of practicality.<note n="6" noteref="750">Gladstone&#x2019;s secretary of state for war, Edward Cardwell, was instituting army reforms, re-organizing the War Office, replacing a large standing army with a smaller permanent force and a large number of trained reservists, and, most controversially, abolishing the purchase of commissions; see also <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701122-TC-CK-01">TC to CK, <date when="1870-11-22">22 Nov. 1870</date></ref>.</note> Surely not a moment too soon!

Perhaps this movement may really carry him thro&#x2019; another session (his horoscope was thought to be bad otherwise); what it will do for the Army nobody yet can know, except in general that, till the British Constitution please to change itself, no right Army is possible to the British Nation or its Gladstones. n.l.<note n="7" noteref="751">TC wrote &#x0201C;n.l.&#x0201D; (new line) to indicate new paragraph.</note> Three days ago I went to Mazzini&#x2019;s Lodgings, to take leave of him on his departure from England for good.<note n="8" noteref="752">Giuseppe Mazzini&#x2019;s last recorded contact with TC was <date when="1867-08">Aug. 1867</date>; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18670810-TC-JAC-01"><sic>45:16</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1867-08-10">10 Aug. 1867</date></corr></ref>. TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1871-02-08">8 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;Yesterday &#x02026; took leave of Mazzini, who is just about returning permanently to Rome, to publish a Newspaper there. I had not seen him for a long time: we talked for about an hour, in a cordial &#x00026; sincere way, with real emotion (I do believe) on both sides;&#x02014;and parted, hardly expecting, either of us, to meet again in this world. &#x02026; Mazzini is the most <hi rend="italic">pious</hi> living man I now know&#x0201D; (TC&#x2019;s journal; privately owned). Mazzini was lodging with Mrs. France at 18 Fulham Rd.

We talked for about an hour, he mostly the Speaker, with eloquence, with affectionate vivacity: he looks very old and hoary, but the eyes are still beautiful and genially bright. He is to settle in Rome; and set forth some &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">truly</hi> patriotic&#x0201D; Newspaper there.<note n="9" noteref="753">Mazzini founded and edited <hi rend="italic">La Roma del Popolo</hi>, <date when="1871-02">Feb. 1871</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872-03">March 1872</date>.</note> He discribed himself as one dead all but the brain part, which belonged to his Country till the very end; he himself having rather the feeling of a <hi rend="italic">Revenant</hi> than of a Man still living. Poor Fellow, it was impossible not to wish him well, and commend him silently to the Good Powers of this Universe. A really pious, heroic little man.

 To myself Scott was never of heroic quality; and seems to be far too young yet for <hi rend="italic">Centenary</hi> operations;&#x02014;which, at any rate, are apt to be blaring nonentities of a rather disgusting nature.

The situation of things in France seems very critical still though Paris has surrendered; &#x00026; Gambetta&#x2019;s projects not only may meet with approbation amongst mad Frenchmen, but also with many ignorant people in this country. &#x02026; And another letter to the Times might do great good, as the first did, both in Germany &#x00026; England, &#x00026; indirectly also in France.&#x0201D;</note>
 that seems now the likely issue. The German management throughout seems to have been well nigh perfect; and with such consum&#x000AF;ation the Victory may be considered of benifit to all the earth.</p>

Buy yourself something nice with it; and consider at all times that my affectionate best wishes are with you; and that if I could in any way do you a useful kindness, I gladly would.</p>
<p>We get a good few Canada Newspapers from you; welcome tokens of your remembrance: in one of the last, there was a very melancholy item of news marked by your hand,&#x02014;the death of your dear little grandchild, poor Mary&#x2019;s Bairn;<note n="2" noteref="762">Jenny Hanning wrote to John A.

Holden was sick &#x02026; she grew weaker and weaker, and poor Mary was nearly worn off her feet &#x02026; she died so very suddenly. &#x02026; I thought [Mary] would lose her reason at the time but she is trying to say that Gods will be done. / Maggie had a letter from her cousin Maggie Carlyle two days ago: they were all well at Bield then. Tom&#x2019;s Wife [Margaret] had a Daughter [Hellen] about a week ago. / Please give my kind love to sister Jean: she too knows what it is to part with her children: a few lines from her might help to comfort Mary in her affliction&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1775E.7).

Poor Mary, she was herself a Child when I saw her last,<note n="3" noteref="763">TC last saw Mary <date when="1850-09">Sept. 1850</date> (see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500913-TC-JWC-01"><sic>25:211</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1850-09-13">13 Sept. 1850</date></corr></ref>); Jenny and her das. left for Canada, <date when="1851-06">June 1851</date> (see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510610-TC-JCA-01"><sic>26:86</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1851-06-10">10 June 1851</date></corr></ref>).</note>
 &#x00026; she is now a bereaved Mother;&#x02014;Death snatches us from one another at all ages! I often think with silent gratitude to Providence how gently we older ones have been dealt with in this respect; saved, a whole family of us, for so many years; none lost but poor Margaret<note n="4" noteref="764">Their sister Margaret (<date when="1803">1803</date>&#x02013;<date when="1830">30</date>); for her death, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300629-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:116&#x02013;20</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-06-29">29 June 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note>

 whom you never saw, but whose death, and my Mother&#x2019;s unappeasable grief for it, are still strangely present to me, after near seventy years. All we can say is, both the Living and the Dead are with God; &#x00026; we have to obey, and be of hope.</p>
<p>You regret sometimes that I do not write to you; but it is not my blame, it is my misfortune rather. For rather above five years past my right hand has been getting useless for writing (the left, strangely enough, is still steady, and holds good); the weight of years, too, 75 of them gone December last, presses heavy on me; and all work, but most especially all kinds of writing are a thing I avoid as sorrowfully disagreeable. Mary Aitken, who drives an admirable pen, is indeed ever willing to be &#x0201C;dictated&#x0201D; to; and I do, in cases of necessity try that method; but find, on the whole, that it never will succeed with me. From the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and from Jean I believe you get all the news that are worth writing; and that is the main interest in the matter.</p>
<p>The D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, of late weeks; &#x00026; seems to be enjoying himself among old friends;&#x02014;and finds it, no doubt, a pleasant &#x00026; useful interruption of his Dumfries solitude, to which he will return with fresh appetite. He is much stronger and cheerier than I; five years <hi rend="italic">younger</hi>, and at least twice five lighter of heart. <pb id="pg-47-157" n="47:157"/>He has an excellent Lodging at Dumfries, yonder; and is of much service to all the kindred; every one of whom he is continually ready to help. Mary Aitken has been here with me above two years;&#x02014;a bright little soul writing for me, trying to be useful and cheerful to me. I have plenty of Friends here; but none of them do me much good, except by their evident good-will; company in general is at once wearisome &#x00026; hurtful to me; silence, and the company of my own sombre thoughts, sad probably but also loving and beautiful, are wholesomer than talking; these and a little serious reading are my chief resource. I have no bodily ailment, except what belongs to the gradual decay of a digestive faculty which was always weak; except when sleepless nights afflict me too much, I have no reason to complain but the contrary. This winter, now nearly done, has been a blusterous cold inclement one as any I can latterly remember; it grew at last to tell upon me as the unfriendliest of all its brethren;&#x02014;but I think, after all, it may have done me little or no intrinsic damage. With the new Spring and its bright days I hope to awaken again and shake away this torpor of nerves and mind.</p>
<p>I have long owed Alick a Letter,&#x02014;that is to say, intended to write him one, though by count it is his turn. I often think of you all on that side the Sea as well as this; if that could do you any good, Alas! I will end here, dear little Sister; wishing all that is good to you and yours, as at all times. I am and remain,</p>

<p><salute>Dear Sir,</salute>&#x02014;Your letter has pleased and interested me; and certainly I wish you progress in your ingenuous pursuit, which may be defined as the highest <pb id="pg-47-158" n="47:158"/>and truest for all men in all ranks of life. Evermore is <hi rend="italic">Wisdom</hi> the highest of conquests to every son of Adam, nay, in a large sense, the one conquest; and the precept to every one of us is ever, &#x0201C;Above all thy gettings, get understanding.&#x0201D;<note n="1" noteref="769">See Prov. 4:7.</note> Books are certainly a great help in this pursuit; but I know not if they are the greatest; the greatest I rather judge are one&#x2019;s own earnest reflections and meditations, and, to begin with, a candid, just, and sincere mind in oneself. Books, however, especially the Books of sincere and true-seeing men, are indisputably a great resource of guidance and assistance; and indeed are at present almost the only one we have left.</p>
<p>I have more than once thought of such a list as you speak of (for we all, in universities as well as workshops, labour under that difficulty, and in the end each of us has to pick his own way); but a good list of the kind would be extremely difficult to do; and would be both an envious and precarious one. Impossible to be right in all your judgments of Books; and still more impossible to please everybody with it if you even were! Perhaps I may try something of it some good day nevertheless.<note n="2" noteref="770">TC had several times compiled reading lists for friends; see, for instance, 38:209&#x02013;10 and (for Lord and Lady Ashburton) 38:257&#x02013;58. He wrote in his journal, <date when="1871-02-14">14 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;I wanted to write down sev<hi rend="italic">l</hi> things &#x02026; some List (perhaps) of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Books</hi> best worth reading by <hi rend="italic">workmen</hi> &#x00026; the eager unguided;&#x2019; &#x00026;c &#x00026;c: but except by &#x2018;dictat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x2019; I cannot, and that never will go rightly with me&#x0201D; (TC&#x2019;s journal; privately owned).</note>
</p>
<p>For the rest, I can assure you that your choice of a Homer is perfectly successful: I reckon Pope&#x2019;s still fairly the best English translation,<note n="3" noteref="771">Alexander Pope (<date when="1688">1688</date>&#x02013;<date when="1744">1744</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22526"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), poet; there are many edns. of his trans. of Homer&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> (<date when="1715">1715</date>&#x02013;<date when="20">20</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> (<date when="1726">1726</date>); TC owned the <date when="1761">1761</date> edn. of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> (see <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s House</hi> <date when="88">88</date>), and he gave Mary Aitken, <date when="1875-06-16">16 June 1875</date>, a <date when="1784">1784</date> edn. of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>, which he probably already owned (see <hi rend="italic">Sotheby&#x2019;s</hi> [<date when="1932">1932</date>] item <date when="75">75</date>).</note>
 though there are several newer, and one older, not without merit; in regard to style, or outward garniture, neither Pope nor one of them has the least resemblance to rough old Homer; but you will get the <hi rend="italic">shape</hi> and essential meaning out of Pope as well as another. In regard to Plato (Socrates didn&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">write</hi> anything; and he is known chiefly by what Plato and Xenophon say of him) your best <pb id="pg-47-159" n="47:159"/>resource will probably by Bohn&#x2019;s Classical Library<note n="4" noteref="772">Henry George Bohn (<date when="1796">1796</date>&#x02013;<date when="1884">1884</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2770"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), translator and publisher; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480911-TC-JAC-01"><sic>23:108</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1848-09-11">11 Sept. 1848</date></corr></ref>. Bohn retired in <date when="1864">1864</date>, and his business, at 4 York St., Covent Garden, was continued by George Bell (<date when="1814">1814</date>&#x02013;<date when="1890">90</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/47443"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) and Frederick Daldy (<date when="1825">1825</date>&#x02013;<date when="1905">1905</date>).</note>
 (Bohn, York-street, Covent-garden), a readable translation at four or five shillings, which any country bookseller can get for you on order: and, indeed, I may say, in regard to all manner of books, Bohn&#x2019;s Publication Series is the usefullest thing I know; and you might as well send to him for a catalogue, which, doubtless, he would willingly send you for the postage stamp. As to English History, Hume&#x2019;s<note n="5" noteref="773">David Hume (<date when="1711">1711</date>&#x02013;<date when="1776">76</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14141"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Scottish philosopher and historian, <hi rend="italic">The History of England, from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in <date when="1688">1688</date></hi>, 6 vols. (<date when="1762">1762</date>).</note>
 is universally regarded as the best; but perhaps none of them can rigorously be called good; and you will be sure to take the first book you can come at, and to read that with all your attention, keeping a map before you, and looking round you on all sides; especially looking before and after for chronology&#x2019;s sake,<note n="6" noteref="774">For a very similar instruction to Jean Aitken, see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511112-TC-JCA-01"><sic>26:225</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1851-11-12">12 Nov. 1851</date></corr></ref>.</note>
&#x02014;upon which latter at least, if not upon various other things, you may find it useful to take notes. Pinkerton&#x2019;s Geography, even the 8vo abridgment (still more the 2 vol. 4to original),<note n="7" noteref="775">Sir John Pinkerton (<date when="1758">1758</date>&#x02013;<date when="1826">1826</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22301"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Scottish historian and poet, <hi rend="italic">Modern Geography</hi>, 2 vols.

 is a useful book in such studies. In Political Economy I consider Smith&#x2019;s &#x0201C;Wealth of Nations,&#x0201D;<note n="8" noteref="776">Adam Smith (bap. <date when="1723">1723</date>&#x02013;<date when="1790">90</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25767"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Scottish moral philosopher and political economist; his major work is <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations</hi> (<date when="1776">1776</date>); TC owned the <date when="1835">1835</date>&#x02013;<date when="1839">39</date> edn. (4 vols.); see <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s House</hi> 85.</note>
 which is the beginning of all the books since, to be still, by many degrees, the best, as well as the pleasantest to read; and in regard to that of &#x0201C;Political Economy,&#x0201D; nay even to that of Plato, &#x00026;c, &#x00026;c, you must not be surprised if the results arrived at considerably disappoint you; and sometimes, though also sometimes not, completely deserve to do so.</p>
<p>Wishing you heartily well, and recommending silence, sincerity, diligence, and patience as the grand conditions of every useful success in your pursuit, I remain, yours sincerely,</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley,</salute>
<p>For a long time I have been anxious to see you, after so unexampled a period of absence! I am very much obliged by your kind offer of 5 o&#x2019;clock to my little Niece and me:<note n="1" noteref="781">Lady Stanley wrote, <date when="1871-02-21">21 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;I have been hoping to see you this long time &#x00026; now write to ask if it would be possible for you to come to tea here at 5 oclock next Monday the 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi> &#x00026; do me the favor to bring your niece.

 but tea in the afternoon is a thing I am forbidden to take; and at that hour I am regularly hastening home, or already got home, with an eye to try for a little sleep before dinner. That, therefore, I grieve to say is not possible at present.</p>
<p>On the contrary I could, and will, any day you appoint, call on you at <hi rend="italic">four</hi> o&#x2019;clock; and from twelve till <hi rend="italic">three</hi> I am, all days, here at home; and should rejoice to be honoured with a call from you.</p>

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>There was talk last week of a letter from you on Sunday, which however did not come; today I send to you a word upon the principle of Mahomet&#x2019;s miracle, &#x0201C;Since the Mountain cannot come to Mahomet, Mahomet can and will come to the Mountain.&#x0201D;<note n="1" noteref="783">Proverbial; cf. Francis Bacon, <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> (<date when="1625">1625</date>).</note>
</p>
<p>It will relieve you to hear that I seem to be slowly recovering out of my dreary contention with want of sleep, which has made my life unusually miserable for the last 7 or 8 weeks. I have not yet had one night of what can be called good sleep; but it is several nights, perhaps 5 or 6, since I absolutely failed to sleep and got into nocturnal chaos, with the certainty of an utterly smashed feeling for the following day. The getting out of sleep, as I have heard you often say, is an altogether easy matter, but the getting into a steady tract of it again is a most ticklish process. I do not yet call myself successful; but I have a better hope than hitherto. It seems purely the fruit of damages, a &#x0201C;sundries at different dates&#x0201D; inflicted on me by the bad winter, and coming in at last for settlement when the Winter itself is gone.</p>
<p>That I have been entirely idle, incapable of anything deserving, never so little, the name of Work I need not tell you; and certainly that degrading element is a great aggravation of all one&#x2019;s other miseries. I feel sometimes as if there were things in me which I still wished to say; and poor Mary is often encouraging me to try if I cannot, though without a hand of my own, begin: she is a most swift and willing scribe, poor creature; but I never can go on at all as if there were nothing between the paper and me,&#x02014;no third party guessing what I was about! This is a haggle which I feel I shall never altogether overcome;&#x02014;nor indeed till I get considerably relieved from this stomachie &#x0201C;Slough of Despond&#x0201D;<note n="2" noteref="784">See John Bunyan, <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress</hi> (<date when="1678">1678</date>).</note>
 can I fairly try; nothing else, I find, but Indigestion is the matter with me, the gradual decay of that indispensable operation, which has been my misery for fifty years; and which cannot be expected now to do other than <hi rend="italic">de</hi>crease till it stop altogether. Let it be as God wills; that is a duty eminently incumbent, which I hope is at no time doubtful to me.</p>
<p>We had a Letter from the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> yesterday; but it was vague and of little interest, evidently written in a great hurry; the one bit of important news, that he still purposed returning home in the beginning of the week. I confidently expect he will find himself sensibly improved by this Town-adventure, and winnowed clear of much country dust by the new and stirring scene he has <pb id="pg-47-162" n="47:162"/>been in. Sometime in Summer, not too far on, I privately expect him here, though he has said nothing about it. I often, indeed generally more or less, have an outlook towards the Sea in Summer; other hopeful shift of lodgings I have now none left,&#x02014;if in this itself there be any hope left. One ought to try it at least.</p>
<p>I have plenty of company, perhaps too much, and of the kind called good; but, though there is a certain stimulus in conversation, and in uttering, in the least faithfully, what one thinks and feels, I seldom feel much real pleasure in these colloquies; and visits of people, in the evening especially, are apt to do me evident hurt;&#x02014;these latter accordingly I strive more and more to forbid. Yesterday I made no fewer than three calls; found a clever old Gentleman, whom I had not seen for two years (Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, long our Ambassador in Turkey,<note n="3" noteref="785">Stratford Canning Redcliffe (<date when="1786">1786</date>&#x02013;<date when="1880">1880</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4558"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, diplomat; much of his career was spent as the British ambassador in Constantinople, where he became known as the &#x0201C;Great Elchi.&#x0201D; TC met him early <date when="1867-11">Nov. 1867</date>; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18671112-TC-LLA-01"><sic>45:65</sic><corr>TC to LLA, <date when="1867-11-12">12 Nov. 1867</date></corr></ref>.</note> a really shrewd, experienced and honest minded old Man): with him I sat in vigorous talk for above an hour; then <hi rend="italic">walked</hi> home (three new miles, making six in all); but, except perhaps some transitory pleasure to the old Diplomatist I could myself trace little or no benifit; and might about as well have been plodding along with no companion but my own solitary thoughts.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You got nothing from us on Saturday but Newspapers; nor has anything come from you today; but we understand that y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> rooms are <hi rend="italic">engaged</hi> for Thursday coming, and we conclude that probably you will go home on Wednesday.

<p>What I write about today is a sad discovery I came upon yesterday in reference to poor Anthony Sterling. I had heard, in a vague accidental manner, that he was unwell; and I yesterday, thinking it was nothing particular, strolled up in that direction to enquire and see. The Servant could not admit me; and had a grave look; but he went at my request to announce me,<note n="4" noteref="798">TC inserted the phrase &#x0201C;at my request to announce me.&#x0201D;</note> and produced the Nephew, Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> John Sterling;<note n="5" noteref="799">Capt. John Barton Sterling, soldier in the Coldstream Guards.</note> from whom I at once learned that the business was of an altogeth<hi rend="italic">r</hi> grave &#x00026; gravest character; &#x00026; that in fact poor Anthony was rapidly advancing towards the inexorable bourne!<note n="6" noteref="800">Anthony Sterling d. <date when="1871-03-01">1 March.</date></note> I was much struck; and the longer I have thought of the matter since, it grows the sadder and more tragic to me,&#x02014;tumbling up into confused and mournful memory so much that has come &#x00026; gone during the 35 years past.<note n="7" noteref="801">TC and Anthony Sterling first met late <date when="1836-12">Dec. 1836</date> or early <date when="1837-01">Jan. 1837</date>; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370117-TC-JOST-01"><sic>9:119</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1837-01-17">17 Jan. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> Anthony has been evidently in a suffering grim unwieldy state for years past, especially since we last returned from Scotland; during which period he got into the way of occasionally calling on me again.

 a showy kind of Lady of whom he seemed to be rather proud, &#x00026; indeed he looked a degree cheerfuller and fresher than I had seen him of late. Alas, it was the last time I was ever to see him in this world. It appears, &#x0201C;about 3 months ago,&#x0201D; I suppose just when Winter had set in, he became much worse; and indeed, in the course of a few weeks, broke down altogether: kidneys, heart, stomach, all manner of functions, ceasing work; the whole system in rapid collapse;<note n="10" noteref="804">John wrote, <date when="1871-03-01">1 March</date>, that Stirling Maxwell had told him that he had seen Sterling about a month ago, and &#x0201C;found him hopelessly ill.&#x0201D;</note>
 so that, several weeks ago, &#x0201C;D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Gull,&#x0201D;<note n="11" noteref="805">William Withey Gull (<date when="1816">1816</date>&#x02013;<date when="1890">90</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11730"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), physician.</note> the Celebrated of the present day, declared <pb id="pg-47-165" n="47:165"/>his visits to be useless henceforth, and ceased to come. The brain itself is now gone; poor Anthony has now no consciousness of where or what he is; dimly and with difficulty recognises his Nephew John, hardly any other; &#x00026; is evidently hastening towards the last goal. The way of all the earth,&#x02014;of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the earth and its million generations, past and coming, till Time itself shall die!&#x02014;</p>
<p>This is all I will write today, dear Brother: somebody is waiting for Mary; &#x00026; we have both together to go on some quasi-mysterious visit to Lady Stanley at 4.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I heard of some intention you had to &#x0201C;write me a long Letter&#x0201D; a good while ago; but nothing has yet come: indeed I guess well enough, by sad experience of my own, how unwilling you are to write at all, if it can be helped; I myself, with a shaking right hand, have almost lost the power of writing. But having got a willing Clerk here (gleg little Mary Aitken who is very good to me), I overcome my languours, and will this day at last accomplish my small purpose of sending <hi rend="italic">you</hi> an articulate word. Alas, if the thoughts I send you could go without writing, you would hardly any day want a Letter: that I firmly believe too is my own case on your side; so we will endeavour to be patient; to be justly thankful, both of us, that we are still spared to send one another <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> Letters, and to be Brothers to one another in this world yet a while!&#x02014;</p>
<p>The Winter here, singularly wild tempestuous and inclement one, has been perceptibly unkind to me; though now, in the Spring, I flatter myself with thoughts of coming back to the old poor level again;&#x02014;whether ever of getting to do any Work more, I dare not promise, or even confidently hope. I have no bodily ailment, except what I have always had for above half a century now, namely, the inability to digest; which of course is increasing as years increase, and is not in the possibility of doing other. I can still walk a great deal in my better days; and it is a thing I try daily as the one medicine I have, or ever really had. Outward things go what might be called altogether prosperously with me; much printing and new printing of my poor bits of Books; which never had such a degree of circulation as now; honour enough, all sorts of honour from my poor fellow creatures &#x00026;c &#x00026;c; all which sure enough is good <pb id="pg-47-166" n="47:166"/>in its kind, is at least better than the contrary would have been; but has all become of small moment, and indeed to a degree that astonishes myself utterly <hi rend="italic">indifferent</hi>, in sight of the Immensities &#x00026; Eternities which I now see close ahead. Plenty of personal friends there are too, who are abundantly kind, and several of them clever and ingenious to talk with; I do not shun these altogether, but neither do I seek them; conversation generally wearies rather than delights me, and I find the company of my own thoughts and recollections; what may be called conversing with the Dead, a more salutary, though far mournfuller employment. In fact, dear Brother, I am now in my 76<hi rend="italic">th</hi> year, and for the last five years especially am left altogether solitary in these waste whirlwinds of existence: that is as you perceive, the summary of my history at present. I think I was always a serious creature too, and always had in the heart of me a feeling that was unspeakable for those I loved. No wonder one&#x2019;s thoughts, in such case, are solemn, and one&#x2019;s heart indisposed for worldly trivialities, however big these think themselves.&#x02014; But I must get out of this; which is leading us nowhither, and fast wasting the space left me for more definite objects at present.</p>
<p>The last Letter I saw of yours was the one to John several months ago, directly on the death of Tom&#x2019;s poor little Boy.<note n="1" noteref="807">Thomas Alexander Carlyle; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701112-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1870-11-12">12 Nov.</date></ref></note>
 That was a sternly sad event. I can never since forget the speech of the poor little creature to his Father as the clouds of Death were sweeping him away!&#x02014; We hear lately from Sister Jenny that she has lost a little Grand-child:<note n="2" noteref="808">Jenny Holden; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710213-TC-JCHA-01">TC to JCHA, <date when="1871-02-13">13 Feb.</date></ref></note>
 no doubt there, too, there is sorrow and mourning. Death at all times lies under the flowers &#x00026; the thorns of existence, whatever or wherever these may be.&#x02014;</p>
<p>In late times, looking at you all in Canada, where you are as it were a little Colony of yourselves; I cannot help feeling thankful that you are there and not here. This Country seems to me to grow more &#x00026; more uninhabitable for the natural minded man of any rank, and especially for the poor man, who has to work for his Bread, and determines to be honest withal. More and more does that become impracticable to him as matters now go; the proportion of false work and of false ware,&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">shoddy</hi> in all departments, practical and spiritual,&#x02014;increases steadily from year to year. Wealth in enormous masses becomes ever more frequent; &#x00026;, in a still higher proportion, poverty, grim famine and the impossibility to live among larger and larger masses of the Working People, in the lower kinds of them. Among the higher kinds of them, intemperance, mutiny, bad behaviour increases daily: in fact, I apprehend before many years the huge abominable Boil will <hi rend="italic">burst</hi>, and the British Empire fall into convulsions; perhaps into horrors and confusions which nobody is yet counting on. All Europe, indeed the whole civilized World, is in weltering confused <pb id="pg-47-167" n="47:167"/>struggle and mutiny: I can find nobody so safe as he that is piously and faithfully tilling the earth and leading a manful life in silence far away from all that, divided by the Sea from all that.&#x02014;</p>
<p>Of our kindred in Scotland, I think you hear pretty regularly; and probably I have nothing new to tell you: I will say only that nothing has gone wrong there since you heard last; and that the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (which also perhaps you know) has been spending a six weeks in Edinburgh; seemingly with both satisfaction and profit, and expects to return tomorrow (Wednesday) afternoon and resume his solitary habits, his Books and his old rural walks at Dumfries, now when the bright Spring has come. He is usually very solitary there and cultivates hardly any Company, but what the walls of the house contain for him. At Scotsbrig, at The Gill, or elsewhere among us, there is nothing changed, still less anything changed for the worse. Let us be thankful, thankful!</p>
<p>I often think of your Boys and Girls, especially of Tom and Jane, and am always glad to have any details about them. It is very long since I had a Letter from your Jane: do not bother her about determining to write to me; say I remember some pretty Letters from her long ago, and if she ever did come upon the thought of writing to me again, it would be very welcome. As to Tom, he knows I always read his Letters with pleasure, especially when he expands freely into the historical and biographical. Some of you tell me at least about this new Edition of my Book, <hi rend="italic">Whether any of you get an actual Copy of it</hi>? There are to be 30 or even 33 volumes; and about 25 are already printed. In a smaller form, there is an older handy Edition, in 23 volumes, I surely think I sent that to Tom or to some of you! There is also to be straightway a <hi rend="italic">People&#x2019;s Edition</hi>; very neat, tho&#x2019; very cheap. Any or all of these, I could readily send, and would to such of you as really needed them. To Boston our Bookseller<note n="3" noteref="809">Field, Osgood, &#x00026; Co; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700928-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1870-09-28">28 Sept.</date></ref></note>
 here has a regular transit of Books; from Boston to you I think the road also is open. Tell me something about this soon as you like.</p>
<p>We have had, as you doubtless know, an agitated six months with the German-French War. Not since we were Boys, and the <hi rend="italic">First</hi> Napoleon was getting handcuffed and flung out of doors,<note n="4" noteref="810">For TC on Napoleon I&#x2019;s abdication and first imprisonment, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18140430-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:6&#x02013;7</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1814-04-30">30 Apl. 1814</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 have I seen so much emotion or so universal about any Continental thing. Yesterday, and not till then, we learn that the <hi rend="italic">Preliminaries</hi> of Peace are actually signed,<note n="5" noteref="811">Thiers was negotiating a peace treaty with the Prussians; it was signed <date when="1871-02-26">26 Feb.</date> and ratified <date when="1871-03-01">1 March.</date></note>
&#x02014;not yet Peace itself; though that latter too is to be looked for as certain in a few days; and so an end to the most furious controversy Europe has ever seen; at least to the completest brashing into ruinous defeat that vain and quarrelsome France has ever had. &#x0201C;Such a thrashing as probably one creature of the human kind <pb id="pg-47-168" n="47:168"/>never gave another&#x0201D; to use poor Will Brown&#x2019;s<note n="6" noteref="812">William (&#x0201C;Wull&#x0201D;) Brown (d. <date when="1838">1838</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381226-TC-JAC-01"><sic>10:248</sic><corr><date when="1838-12-26">TC to JAC, 26 Dec. 1838</date></corr></ref>), their paternal cousin.</note>

 did richly deserve it; and we all hope will be the better for it; no event has taken place in Europe in my time that pleased me better; and, for my own part, I expect that the results, which are certain to be many-fold, and are much dreaded by the ignorant English, will be salutary &#x00026; of benifit to all the world.&#x02014;Adieu, my dear Brother, I will weary you no more today: I am in fact utterly stupid, and have not, except symbolically, been able to express anything of my feelings towards you or what I most wanted to say. But you understand it all well enough without my saying. Give my Love and Blessing to all the Canadian kindred, big and little, young and old. Be diligent and faithful, patient and hopeful one and all of you; and may we all know, at all times, that verily the Eternal rules above us, and that nothing finally <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> has happened or can happen.</p>
<p>Send some news, the more copious the better, some willing hand of you; it will be welcome whenever it comes.</p>

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>On Sunday last it was but a small part of my feelings that I expressed to you, on hearing your sad news. The weight of the event first became sensible to me when I got out of doors and was left alone;<note n="1" noteref="815">TC called at the Sterling household, 3 South Pl., Sun. <date when="1871-02-26">26 Feb.</date>, when he was told by John Barton Sterling that Anthony Coningham Sterling was dying; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710227-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1871-02-27">27 Feb.</date></ref></note>
 and indeed I may say it has grown weightier and sadder to me ever since. Your Uncle&#x2019;s many fine qualities were from of old well known to me; and never could be hidde[n] in the latter times by his outward asperities and unreasonable impetuosities: I counted him always a right honest, true minded, and even superiorly gifted man, who loved me well (me and mine); and whose own life had been obstructed by many sore and heavy contradictions. And now, in addition to all that, his departure is to me, more than to almost any other, a source of tragic thoughts; it is as it were the last living root, now also disappearing, of what was once a beautiful and fruitful grove or friendly umbrageous wood in the commonplace <pb id="pg-47-169" n="47:169"/>wilderness of things: you well know by tradition how we were related to your Grandfather&#x2019;s house, to your Father, your Grandmother, your Uncle;<note n="2" noteref="816">John Barton Sterling&#x2019;s grandfather was Edward Sterling (<date when="1773">1773</date>&#x02013;<date when="1847">1847</date>), journalist, known as the &#x0201C;Thunderer of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>,&#x0201D; his grandmother was Hester, b. Coningham (<date when="1783">1783</date>&#x02013;<date when="1843">1843</date>), and his father was John Sterling, TC&#x2019;s great friend. The Carlyles had been friendly with the whole family; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 94, 95&#x02013;96, and earlier vols.</note>
 and you can understand how the sudden <hi rend="italic">finis</hi> of all that tumbles up on me a world of recollections of the most mournful and also of the most tender and even sacred kind!</p>
<p>In brief the practical point I have to impress upon you, my dear young Friend, is, the very great desire I feel to have speedy and frequent news from that Sick-room; to hear from you at once when the least change occurs for the better or the worse; at lowest to hear from you, never so briefly, or, what were still better, to see you once every week till the Inexorable and Inevitable itself arrive.<note n="3" noteref="817">Anthony C. Sterling d. <date when="1871-03-01">1 March.</date></note>
 Do not deny me this request; probably one of the last I shall ever have to make of you.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am very glad you have got safe home to Dumfries ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; I have no doubt you will find yourself improved, refreshed &#x00026; strengthened more or less in resuming your old ways after this interval of pause. We got your Letter yesterday; many thanks for writing so soon. I learned with a kind of shock the fate of poor Madame Otthenin;<note n="1" noteref="819">Jean Otthenin had been living in France with her das., Irma Durival and Margaret Otthenin; because of the Franco-Prussian War there had been no communication possible since Aug.; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701224-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1870-12-24">24 Dec.</date></ref> John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1871-03-01">1 March</date>, with the news of her death in Nov., and enclosed a letter from Irma to Dr. Hunter (see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710130-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1871-01-30">30 Jan.</date></ref>) with the details; he himself received a similar letter, <date when="1871-03-03">3 March.</date></note>
 and how, without effort of <hi rend="italic">hers</hi>, poor bewildered heavy-laden old Lady, she had found an inespugnable refuge, and covert from the storm of War and of Life, &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Ja ja</hi>&#x0201D;; all does find its end, all has its measure and bounds. Poor Irma seemed greatly agitated, as is natural. I could not make out from her handwriting what the disease which proved fatal had been; it read like &#x2018;ederme of the arm&#x2019;; but the words refused to have any sense to me. You might now forward to her the <hi rend="italic">Macmillan</hi> which I send today; especially <pb id="pg-47-170" n="47:170"/>I hope you will at once write to her,&#x02014;and do not fail to express my real sympathy,<note n="2" noteref="820">John wrote, <date when="1871-03-03">3 March</date>: &#x0201C;I mean to write to Irma on Sunday &#x02026; so if you have any message for her &#x00026; her sister [Margaret] please send it by tomorrow&#x2019;s post.&#x0201D;</note>
 withal; for it is real enough, and mournful enough; if it c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do her any good at all.</p>
<p>Poor Anthony Sterling has likewise rapidly reached the goal. I had written to Captain John earnestly enforcing the request left with him to send me frequent news; before there was time for an answer, the enclosed line came from him; and yesterday, by way of answer he had called here while I was out. All is ended there too.</p>
<p>I am still not a little bothered with my sleep; but I continue to hope it is mending, and will not just now trouble you further on the subject.&#x02014; Miss Jewsbury&#x2019;s Memorial for a Pension seems, after all our trouble upon it, to have failed again;&#x02014;evidently hopeless under Gladstone&#x2019;s Ministry. Forster is very angry; nor can any of us well account for the failure of so natural a request, backed as it was by what everybody calls 32 of the best names in England. Some little pique of Gladstone&#x2019;s,<note n="3" noteref="821">Gladstone wrote to Tennyson, <date when="1872-02-09">9 Feb. 1872</date>, explaining his criteria for granting civil list pensions: &#x0201C;With respect to literary pensions I think it was the intention of parliament that they should be given to really distinguished literary men. &#x02026; I have found that it was necessary, in practice, to recognise loss of health, old age or calamity, as elements in the case for pensions of this class; but I have endeavoured to limit this admission to those cases only where some real service had been rendered, by works of intrinsic value, to the cause of letters&#x0201D; (Hallam Tennyson, <hi rend="italic">Alfred Lord Tennyson: A Memoir By His Son</hi> [London and New York, <date when="1897">1897</date>] 2:112). Jewsbury was a distinguished literary reviewer, one of the <hi rend="italic">Athen&#x000E6;um&#x2019;s</hi> main reviewers, and had pbd. five novels and two children&#x2019;s books.</note>
 perhaps spite against some name of the 32, and willingness to give that one a slap as he passes? Roebuck, who, with all his eagerness to help in the matter, charitably refused for such a reason,<note n="4" noteref="822">John Arthur Roebuck (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x02013;<date when="1879">79</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23945"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), politician, M.P. for Sheffield <date when="1849">1849</date>&#x02013;<date when="1868">68</date> and <date when="1874">1874</date> to his death; radical in his youth, he was unaligned to either of the main parties, but more often anti-Liberal (Gladstone&#x2019;s party) in his positions; presumably Roebuck did not sign knowing that Gladstone was hostile to him.</note>
 said to Mary &#x0201C;His (Gladstone&#x2019;s) <hi rend="italic">smallness</hi> of mind is quite appalling, and only over<hi rend="italic">topped</hi> by his vanity which reaches towards the Infinite!&#x0201D; It is reckoned probable <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will not long continue helmsman; so there may be room for a new trial.<note n="5" noteref="823">Jewsbury was finally granted a civil list pension of &#x000A3;40 a year by Disraeli, <date when="1874-06-19">19 June 1874</date>.</note>
 Poor Geraldine seems gradually losing her eyes; becoming old too, and in &#x0201C;merit&#x0201D; if such a word be applicable at all fairly rises above the average of the Applicants favoured by Gladstone and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>.</p>

<salute>My dear Miss Wellmer,</salute>
<p>My Uncle and I are very sorry to know that you are in such sorrow at pres-ent<note n="1" noteref="827">Meta Wellmer&#x2019;s mother, Eva Margaretha Wellmer, b. Wirth, had d. recently.</note>&#x02014; We sympathize very much with you; but speaking is of little use in such case&#x02014;the heart knoweth its own bitterness and a Stranger intermeddleth not therewith.<note n="2" noteref="828">See Prov. 14:10.</note> I am very glad you cared to write to me at such a time and that you wished me to write in return, though I have little news to tell you that you would care to hear. My Uncle and I are sitting here together, he reading and I writing, by the same Lamp; he bids me tell you he &#x0201C;is profoundly sorry to hear of your great grief, which only time and reflection can in the least smooth down and make more easy to bear; he has only one advice to offer you, that is: not to remain alone and not to be idle, for he says work is the only thing which can for a moment make one forget or cease to remember one&#x2019;s own cares.&#x0201D;&#x02014; Our drawingroom is a small room<note n="3" noteref="829">The drawing room was at the front of the first (second in U.S.) floor; see<!-- 172 --> see above.</note> prettily furnished by my late Aunt who was a very graceful clever woman and made everything pretty round my Uncle wherever they might be; she died very suddenly five years ago and my Uncle never seems to forget that he has lost her even for a day.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept many thanks from me, cordial and mournful, for the Volume<note n="1" noteref="838">Presumably a work of either John Sterling, John Barton&#x2019;s father, or Anthony C. Sterling; unidentified further.</note>
 I received on Saturday night. Your good Sister<note n="2" noteref="839">Either Julia Maria or Hester Isabella Sterling.</note>
 did not over estimate the interest it would have for me. It is the express image, more than writing can well be, of the pure clear-seeing high and pious soul that threw it out on paper; I have read it with many thoughts indeed; it is very mournful and very beautiful to me; and will remain a precious memorial of days that are no more.</p>
<p>With many grateful regards to your Sister<note n="3" noteref="840">TC apparently sent some books to Julia and Hester, probably vols. 1&#x02013;5 of the people&#x2019;s edn. of TC&#x2019;s works, <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> (vol. <date when="1">1</date>), <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> (vols. 2&#x02013;<date when="4">4</date>), and the <hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling</hi> (vol. <date when="5">5</date>), all pbd. 1871; Julia Sterling wrote, <date when="1871-03-24">24 March</date>: &#x0201C;Many thanks for sending us the books &#x00026; for so kindly writing our names yourself. We are very glad to have them from you. Sometimes when I open that book I think there is nothing <hi rend="italic">except</hi> friendship that does not grow old &#x02026; &#x00026; I need hardly say what a tender feeling we must always have for one who loves my Father as you do&#x0201D;; &#x0201C;that book&#x0201D; was probably TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling</hi>. Julia wrote from 6 Bolton Row (where she lived with her sister, Hester), and hoped to see TC &#x0201C;before we return to Cornwall.&#x0201D;</note>

<p>Maggie Welsh is to come to us on Thursday next: it is a long time ago that I had promised her a little visit up hither; &#x00026; alas, it is only in fulfilment of such promise that I can be said to have invited her,&#x02014;so broken feeble &#x00026; dispirited as I now feel; certainly in no want of <hi rend="italic">visitors</hi> for one thing, but we expect the visit will not last long; I had said &#x0201C;some three weeks&#x0201D;; Mary said &#x0201C;two or three.&#x0201D; We may expect one calendar month will handsomely complete the affair. Poor Maggie is one of the pliablest and softest of guests; creates no noise or mischief anywhere, and is altogether glad and ready to be useful wherever she sees the least chance. I am often sorry to think of the life she has had and that it is not improving as the weight of years advances.<note n="3" noteref="844">Maggie&#x2019;s sister Mary was addicted to opium and their brother Walter was in debt; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710130-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1871-01-30">30 Jan.</date></ref></note>

<p>Forster is better; is gone upon his journeyings;<note n="4" noteref="845">Forster wrote, <date when="1871-03-07">7 March</date>, that he was leaving that day.</note> and reports the business to agree with him. He was really miserably ill all winter; coughing like a volcano, missing sleep, full of suppressed gout &#x00026;c &#x00026;c &#x00026;c; and all the time overwhelmed with business, not for himself only but for others; I have more than once recommended a warm climate for his Winters; but he really cannot well go; he has still one winter to front here at his post (and so become 60 of age) before he can apply for <hi rend="italic">any</hi> retiring pension, directly on attaining 60, he can retire with &#x000A3;700 a year from his &#x0201C;Lunacy&#x0201D; affairs.

 that feat he would do yesterday; and is probably getting under way just now with intention to be here before tomorrow morning. His Address was to be on the Meaning (eternal worth and meaning) of Scottish Calvinism; upon which subject, I have little doubt he will be new and well worth hearing to the St. Andrews people. He had the Address in print before leaving London; but could not give me a Copy, though anxious to do it; there will be copies enough straightway and you shall have one properly printed by about Tuesday or Wednesday next.<note n="6" noteref="847">John wrote, <date when="1871-03-19">19 March</date>: &#x0201C;I send yesterday&#x2019;s Scotsman which contains Froude&#x2019;s Lecture at S<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Andrews, though not perhaps in a perfect form. &#x02026; I shall be glad to have the perfect copy &#x02026; which you promise me.

 this one is evidently a clever kind of man; and to my surprise lazily said several wise things, and, most surprising of all, plainly hinted an opinion of &#x0201C;Constitutional Government&#x0201D; which I imagined had been fully shared by no mortal except my own poor self, for many years back!

 I make no answer though I do right heartily recognize, as everybody does or will at last do, that the Germans have done their French job in a right workmanlike manner.

<p>Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> two Letters, the second of them this morning, punctually arrived; many thanks for them. At this moment, 3 P.M., I have just returned from a long <pb id="pg-47-180" n="47:180"/>drive with Lady Ashburton, round by Hampstead &#x00026;c, in beautiful sunshine and Spring air;&#x02014;a drive by appointment;&#x02014;am now due for a walk; and have hardly a moment left, were there even no other impediment upon me. But there is unfortunately; and, to myself, a very grievous one. My Sleep-history&#x02014;for the last two weeks, especially for the last week, has been quite deplorable; and last night the worst of all: so that literally I am good for nothing today, and can write only to say that I am so. This miserable affair of Sleep does not yet quite discourage me; but it does seems to indicate, such are the new phases of it, some crisis coming on or taking place; crisis towards good or towards what might be called bad I cannot say; and indeed, speaking with all calmness, cannot be said to care. All I have to pray for&#x02014;is, that it would be speedy, and that I may have patience for it, pious silent patience, given me, whether it be long or short. So we will say no more of that at present.</p>
<p>Maggie Welsh came duly, and adjusts herself, with the utmost quietness and kindly good humour, as her knack is, into the fluctuating element. I never hear her more than if she were a shadow; Mary &#x00026; she breakfast together independent of my irregularities; sit down stairs &#x00026; lovingly do their respective functions; so that Maggie at least does us no manner of ill; and if my sleep were back, or even whether or not, might almost be reckoned a small increment rather. Mary is very good and kind, poor little Soul; has been up three times in the hollow of the night ministering to me like a benificent little Fairy: yesterday she had from Lady Ashburton a shining testimony of that Lady&#x2019;s about her,<note n="1" noteref="858">&#x0201C;A gift of a gold watch&#x0201D;; note by A. Carlyle on MS; otherwise unidentified.</note>
 which I doubt not is rather agreeable to the little wretch;&#x02014;but I leave her to report the thing to her own Mother (as of course she will do in a day or two) having no authority of my own to speak of such matters. She has already done out of her own little head four Letters for me to correspondents requiring nothing but second hand; and had just got done five minutes before I was set down at this door.</p>

TC knew Cl&#x000E9;ment-Thomas and wrote in his journal, <date when="1871-03-26">26 March</date>, of his shock at the death: &#x0201C;Some four days I heard from Froude of the miserable death of Commandant Clement Thomas in the horrid insurrectionary puddle now going on in Paris. From all likelihoods I had &#x00026; have the sorrowful idea that it is the same M. Thomas I knew&#x02014;some 26 years ago as one of the companions of Cavaignac here,&#x02014;who had broken out from political imprisonment in Ham, &#x00026; fled to Cavaignac resourceless, as so many others did. Cavaignac repeatedly brought him here; and, apart from his fixed but quiet republicanism, was well esteemed by both of <hi rend="italic">us</hi>. I can vividly remember smoking with him in company of Cavaignac &#x00026;c one evening, &#x00026; even what we said to one another. He was a most good-humoured, strong-built, well-conditioned man; had a fine bright smile, &#x00026; shewed, on occasion, a lively sense of humour. He had returned to Paris on amnesty, which was granted by Louis-Philippe shortly before the Finis of Louis. For ten years afterwards I heard no more of Thomas (except from the Newspapers once in <date when="1848">1848</date> that he had been appointed commandant of the National Guard); but in <date when="1857">1857</date> (or 8? [<date when="1858-08">Aug.</date>&#x02013;<date when="1858-09">Sept. 1858</date>]), in returning from my <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Tour in Germany, somewhere in the country of Spa, in a railway carriage, he &#x00026; I recognised one another and rode a stage together. He was there an exile of Napoleon&#x2019;s making; still fresh &#x00026; strong of hope, tho&#x2019; his dark red hair was getting grizzled; &#x00026; our tone together was much less merry than formerly.&#x02014; The next account I get of him is <hi rend="italic">this</hi> which I have recovered with difficulty from the ever-flowing stream of Newspaper rubbish. [TC included a clipping from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1871-03-21">21 March</date>, about Cl&#x000E9;ment-Thomas&#x2019;s death, with TC&#x2019;s hand at top: &#x2018;Poor <hi rend="italic">Cl&#x000E9;ment-Thomas</hi>, on the Place Pigalle Montmartre, Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> <date when="1871-03-18">18 March 1871</date>!&#x2019;]. Since then I have often had the face &#x00026; attitude of Thomas in that horrible scene before my mind, almost to a visual degree; and, mid my waste miseries in the sleepless nights, his undaunted bearing has been a rebuke to me. <hi rend="italic">Good</hi> be with him, the valiant Thomas now at rest&#x0201D; (TC&#x2019;s journal; privately owned).

<p>[My other Manuscripts I leave to my brother John. They are with one exception of no moment to me. I have never seen any of them since they were written. One of them is a set of fragments about James First which were loyally fished out for me from much other Cromwellian rubbish, and doubtless carefully copied more than twenty years ago by the late John Chorley<note n="7" noteref="879">For Chorley&#x2019;s copying of material on James VI and I (<date when="1565">1565</date>&#x02013;<date when="1625">1625</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14592"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), king of Scotland, England, and Ireland, described by TC in <date when="1865-02">Feb. 1865</date> as &#x0201C;About James I. and Charles I.

But neither this latter nor perhaps any of the others is worth printing. On this point however my Brother can take Counsel with John Forster and James Anthony Froude and do what is then judged fittest. Many or most of these papers I often feel that I myself should burn; but probably I never shall after all.

<salute>Dear Helps,</salute>
<p>I am very much gratified by that kind dedication of your <hi rend="italic">Cortes</hi><note n="1" noteref="888">Arthur Helps, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Hernando Cortes</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1871">1871</date>).</note>
 to me. It has in the very tone of it a beautiful simplicity and sincerity; it puts on record, before I leave this world, a relation which was always gracious cheerful profitable and pleasant to me;&#x02014;in short it gives me more satisfaction than all the &#x0201C;dedications&#x0201D; that were ever made to me, or are like to be.<note n="2" noteref="889">The dedication was written in the form of a letter to TC: &#x0201C;I dedicate this work to you, because I desire an occasion to record my gratitude for all your kindness to me in times past. When you first honoured me by making me your friend, I was a mere youth, while you were in the full maturity of manhood; but you were always kind and tolerant to me; and we were from the first, as we have been ever since, the best of friends. &#x02026; / I do remember that we were not always of the same mind in our discussions on things in general; but there were some points on which we did agree, and do agree, thoroughly. We both believe that there is such a thing possible as good government, and that it would decidedly be desirable that men should live under good government. / We also think that whatever a man does, he should take great pains in doing it,&#x02014;that in short, good work is an admirable thing. &#x02026; / I have now only to say &#x02026; that I should not have presumed to dedicate to so indefatigable student as yourself, this book of mine, if it had cost me no new researches, and if it did not contain my last and most carefully weighed observations upon the matters to which it relates&#x0201D; (Helps, <hi rend="italic">Life of Hernando Cortes</hi> 1:v, vi, x).</note></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Cortes</hi> himself I believe will profit not a little by being disengaged from the <pb id="pg-47-188" n="47:188"/>big Book<note n="3" noteref="890">Arthur Helps, <hi rend="italic">The Spanish Conquest in America, and its Relation to the History of Slavery and to the Government of Colonies</hi>, 4 vols.

Helps wrote in the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>: &#x0201C;This Life is not a mere extract from my History of the Spanish Conquest. &#x02026; I went carefully &#x02026; over every sentence quoted from that History, to see whether, by the aid of additional knowledge, I could correct or improve it; and I have added greatly to those parts which especially concern the private life of Cortes&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">The Life of Hernando Cortes</hi> 1:v).</note>
 where so many cannot well afford to follow him; and to the select few who, like myself, desire also to know his connections there, he still remains attainable in that form. I return you many thanks for Dedication and Copy both, the latter of which is again in process of being read here. Long may you live, dear Helps, to write new Books and purify and pacify your distracted fellow creatures with sprinklings of mild wisdom, in a form all your own!</p>
<p>It has not been want of will that has kept me so long from answering your message,<note n="4" noteref="891">Helps wrote to TC, <date when="1870-03-09">9 March 1870</date>, forewarning him: &#x0201C;An infliction will come upon you in the course of the next three months. It is now your turn to have a &#x2018;tremmock.&#x2019; I meditate dedicating to you my &#x2018;Life of Cortes,&#x2019; in a long epistle, which will give me an opportunity of saying some things which I want to say&#x02014;especially to declare that this book is not a mere warmed-up portion of the Spanish Conquest&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1769.<date when="185">185</date>); see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700308-TC-AH-01"><sic>46:170</sic><corr>TC to AH, <date when="1870-03-08">8 March 1870</date></corr></ref>.

There was a moment&#x2019;s pause. No one moved; he stood in the middle of the room without speaking. &#x02026; Lady Stanley went to meet him. &#x2018;Here is a little birthday present we want you to accept from us all, Mr. Carlyle,&#x2019; said she, quickly pushing up before him a small table, upon which stood the clock ticking all ready for his acceptance. Then came another silence, broken by a knell sadly sounding in our ears. &#x2018;Eh, what have I got to do with Time any more?&#x2019; he said.

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>It is very interesting to me, that account you give of the poor body Carruthers and his shipwrecks, and adventures, bad and good,<note n="1" noteref="902">Jean Aitken wrote, <date when="1871-04-14">14 April</date>, detailing the adventures of &#x0201C;Geordie Carruthers nephew to Carruthers of Haregills &#x00026; Carruthers who married old Mrs Garthwait. He was brought up at the Kirksyke with old John &#x00026; Jenny Jardine &#x02026; &#x00026; went out to Canada 39 years ago. He had to work as &#x2018;fireman&#x2019; in the Packets [steam ships] till he got a knowledge of the machinery when he got to be engineer. &#x02026; He is too old to work in the steamers now (67 years) &#x00026; lives at Toronto with his son, his wife being dead. &#x02026; This luckless little ingineer &#x02026; was wrecked on his passage 5 weeks ago one other passenger &#x00026; six of the crew only being picked up in a boat reshipped &#x00026; sent on to Glasgow &#x00026; Ecclefechan without a penny or a rag but what was on their backs.&#x0201D; George Carruthers (b. <date when="1805">1805</date>). Jean described him at length: &#x0201C;A stout active shrewd looking little old man with a broad short face, very much tanned, grey eyes set wide apart &#x00026; bushy steel grey hair. He wore a brown fur cap &#x00026; short blue sailor looking coat. &#x02026; But very rusty looking, &#x00026; <hi rend="italic">no vestige of linen visible</hi>.&#x0201D;</note>&#x02014;especially of his <pb id="pg-47-193" n="47:193"/>experiences, as eye-witness, in our dear old Alick&#x2019;s establishment.<note n="2" noteref="903">Jean wrote that Geordie &#x0201C;recognised Alick &#x00026; his wife when they came on board his ship when they were in search of a &#x2018;location&#x2019; [Alick and family sailed for the U.S., June 1843, finally settling in Canada, June 1844; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440617-TC-JCA-01"><sic>18:71&#x02013;72</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1844-06-17">17 June 1844</date></corr></ref>] and has known them ever since. &#x02026; He saw Alick 16<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Feb, shortly before he started for this Country.&#x0201D; Geordie had spent a week at New Year, <date when="1871">1871</date>, with Alick and his family and told Jean: &#x0201C;They have a nice comfortable house &#x00026; farm, &#x00026; no man stands higher in the public estimation in Brantford than y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> brother Sandy.&#x0201D;</note> I perfectly recollect both Carrutherses (all the Carrutherses) of Haregills<note n="3" noteref="904">The Carruthers brothers lived at Haregills, farm about 4 mi. (6.5 km.) N of Ecclefechan; one of them was m. to Jean, b.

His father was possibly John Garthwaite (b. ca. <date when="1791">1791</date>).</note> a <hi rend="italic">blethering</hi> noisy, ever-unwashed man. With an effort, too, I think I can at last summon out a third, considerably younger Brother, called Jamie Carruthers, probably a kind of Journeyman Clogger;<note n="5" noteref="906">Maker of clogs; James Carruthers, shoemaker, Ecclefechan.</note> who had come out from Dumfries, and was working at Ecclefechan for a livelihood in the later years of his life. He also was, in the physical sense, an overwhelmingly dirty man; seems in my recollection to have had a running scrofula (with cabbage blades &#x00026;c) about the abominable neck of him; had a snoring, indistinct, pockmarked face, with the eyes swim&#x000AF;ing in it, as if half-boiled and nearly blind,&#x02014;a most ugly physiognomy, though rather to be pitied and avoided than in any way <hi rend="italic">hated</hi>. This surely must have been the Father of your present <hi rend="italic">Gangrel</hi> Carruthers<note n="6" noteref="907">According to parish records, George&#x2019;s parents were John and Agnes Carruthers, Gretna.</note> in the brown cap? who the Gangrell himself can have been I cannot in the least make out. Probably he is of a more recent date than my personal remembrances of the Kirksyke<note n="7" noteref="908">Kirksyke, farm in Hoddom parish.</note> reach to? I very well remember old Crury Jardine, the Mason (how well!) and his big sack of a Wife,&#x02014;a Sister of these Carrutherses:<note n="8" noteref="909">John Curry Jardine (b. ca. <date when="1784">1784</date>), mason, m. Agnes, b. Carruthers (b. ca. <date when="1791">1791</date>).</note>
 but the Jardine pair had nothing of young about them in my time, except one big harl of a daughter, hardy and coarse as hemp, not a bad lass otherwise, whom I know not what became of. There was, at that time, no Boy in the establishment.<note n="9" noteref="910">Their da. was Jane (b. ca. <date when="1814">1814</date>); they later had two boys, George (b. ca. <date when="1821">1821</date>) and Thomas (b. ca. <date when="1825">1825</date>).</note> Can this Gangrel Carruthers, now at Dumfries, be by chance the upshot of a certain &#x0201C;Billy-Bobby,&#x0201D;<note n="10" noteref="911">John A.

<p>I was really interested in these ancient Ecclefechan trifles; to me they are impressive naturally as to few others.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for the Letter you have written about Irma; you will at least get to the bottom of that wild looking project of hers, and see whether there is any possibility in it or none.<note n="1" noteref="918">Apparently Jean Otthenin had received a pension of &#x000A3;50 a year from the heirs of Lord Balgray. David Robertson Williamson (<date when="1761">1761</date>&#x02013;<date when="1837">1837</date>), Lord Balgray, of Balgray House, Dumfriesshire, Scottish judge.

Carlyle his letter from Irma, as John wrote, <date when="1871-04-15">15 April</date>: &#x0201C;Poor Irma is evidently in a sea of troubles, &#x00026; one would be glad to help her if possible; but she has very little common sense or true veracity of character, &#x00026; her statements often depend on mere imagination &#x00026; are not to be relied on without due investigation.&#x0201D; But the pension was real as John then wrote, <date when="1871-04-20">20 April</date>: &#x0201C;I had a letter yesterday from Mr Steuart of India Street about Madame Otthenin&#x2019;s Pension. He &#x00026; his father &#x02026; &#x2018;have long acted for her in little business matters gratuitously&#x2019;; &#x00026; had not heard of her death till he got Irma&#x2019;s letter &#x00026; mine. &#x02026; He is to forward both &#x2018;to the representatives of Lord Balgray,&#x2019; by my permission, &#x00026; see if there be any chance of continuing the pension.&#x0201D;</note>
 and that will be accomplished.&#x02014; If poor Maggie is actually left resourceless; dependent altogether on the pity of others, might it not be feasible to combine the help of all the friends she has to make up some little fund for her against a still worse day? Irma would have to take charge of the affair: I recollect only the Cressfields (if any of them survive in New S. Wales);<note n="3" noteref="920">Dr. William Little (<date when="1760">1760</date>&#x02013;<date when="1847">1847</date>), of Cressfield House, 1 mi. (1.5 km.)

I will readily to your &#x000A3;50 add another;&#x02014;but you did well not to <hi rend="italic">send</hi> any money during the present War troubles; and indeed I almost think it would be worth while and better to aim at the above general enterprise first; and ascertain what feasibility is in it; judge <hi rend="italic">you</hi> altogether;<note n="4" noteref="921">John wrote, <date when="1871-04-15">15 April</date>, that he had thought of sending a gift of &#x000A3;50 to Maggie, once it was safe to send money through France. John replied, <date when="1871-04-25">25 April</date>, that he knew almost no-one else who knew Jean Otthenin: &#x0201C;Miss Maxwell Little was poor herself when she left &#x00026; sold Cressfield, &#x00026; none of the children of her brothers Frank &#x00026; Archy are known to me even by name. &#x02026; Perhaps it might be best to send the order for &#x000A3;50, which I still have, as a joint gift from you &#x00026; me &#x02026; &#x00026; then send another for the same sum later.

It is a society which one would like to see successful; but its task is difficult to accomplish.

<salute>Dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Phillipps,</salute>
<p>It is long since we heard with any distinctness of you; and this word that now arrives is very welcome. On my side, too, I have sent many a thought and enquiry after you; not able to do more than guess vaguely as to your whereabout, still less as to what you might be doing or how it was faring with you and yours. Happily there seems to have nothing essential gone wrong; and I am much obliged by the assurance to that effect.<note n="1" noteref="931">Catherine Phillipps wrote, <date when="1871-04-18">18 April</date>, from Dover, where she now lived: &#x0201C;I so often think of you in this Dover that I cannot help writing you a few lines. I want to know how you are in <hi rend="italic">bodily</hi> health and what you are really about&#x02014;and if I write I cannot get an answer except from your kind little niece if she is still with you&#x02014; I hope you are well; for you are one of the very few of my real old friends left me on this earth.&#x0201D; TC and Phillipps had become re-acquainted in <date when="1868-10">Oct. 1868</date>, but had had little contact since then; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681024-TC-CPH-01"><sic>45:191&#x02013;95</sic><corr>TC to CPH, <date when="1868-10-31">31 Oct. 1868</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>To me also Dover, where I once was, and properly only once for a few hours some years ago, was a most mournful place; scattered irrecognisably hither &#x00026; thither,<note n="2" noteref="932">TC visited Caroline Davenport Bromley at her home, Ripple Court, Ringwould, nr. Dover, <date when="1866-08-13">13</date>&#x02013;<date when="1866-08-27">27 Aug. 1866</date>; traveling through Dover on arrival, he remarked: &#x0201C;a country wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not recognise one yard of&#x0201D;; see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18660813-TC-JAC-01"><sic>44:36</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1866-08-13">13 Aug. 1866</date></corr></ref>.</note> full of noise and confusion, and populous only with pale shadows <pb id="pg-47-198" n="47:198"/>and recollections more or less ghastly of the things and persons that had made it human to me in the years long fled for ever. I, with great difficulty, found a Liverpool St, which I tried to believe might be the old Liverpool Terrace, though no feature of it was recognisable to me as such. Edward Irving&#x2019;s Lodging I could not even trace or guess at to the extent you have done:<note n="3" noteref="933">Phillipps wrote: &#x0201C;<supplied>[T]</supplied>he old Dover no longer exists, either for me or for others&#x02014; A large uncomfortable straggling Town is built upon the Sands &#x00026; elsewhere&#x02014;Liverpool Terrace, is now Liverpool street &#x00026; no longer looks upon the Sea, having several rows of ugly houses between it &#x00026; the Sea, &#x00026; I cannot find out the house where poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Irving used to give me lectures upon my forward behaviour &#x00026; used to drill me upon <hi rend="italic">les convenances</hi> &#x00026; then end by expressing some desperately unmoral sentiment. &#x02026; <supplied>[T]</supplied>he house in Townwall street where the Irvings &#x00026; you lived, when the Stracheys came down here&#x02014;I see no trace of the house&#x02014;tho&#x2019; I know it exists behind some mildewed wall.&#x0201D; TC visited Dover, <date when="1824-10">Oct. 1824</date>, in company with Edward Irving, his wife, Isabella, b. Martin (<date when="1797">1797</date>&#x02013;<date when="1854">1854</date>), and their son, Edward (<date when="1824">1824</date>&#x02013;<date when="25">25</date>); Phillipps had been there with her cousin Julia Strachey, b. Kirkpatrick, and Edward Strachey; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241004-TC-JCE-01"><sic>3:165&#x02013;72</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1824-10-04">4 Oct. 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> in short all was jumbled into chaotic wreck for me; and I left the place not wishing ever to behold it again.</p>
<p>Our poor little French Tour,<note n="4" noteref="934">TC, Edward Strachey, and Phillipps went to Paris together, <date when="1871-10-23">23 Oct.</date>&#x02013;<date when="1824-11-06">6 Nov. 1824</date>; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241107-TC-JAC-01"><sic>3:178&#x02013;188</sic>><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1824-11-07">7 Nov. 1824</date></corr></ref>, and Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 305&#x02013;7.</note> so pleasant and full of interest in those old days,&#x02014;alas, what it has grown to! Surely no Country I have read or heard of ever by its own delirium and ill luck, fell into such an ignominious welter of anarc[h]y and misery as poor France is now in. With you I altogether heartily and sorrowfully pity it; with the ardent <hi rend="italic">wish</hi>, which struggles to be the sure <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>, that it may recover its pristine beauty and brilliancy and be once more the ornament of Europe.<note n="5" noteref="935">Phillipps wrote: &#x0201C;I think you have been hard upon the French if those &#x02026; leaves collected again by the Newspapers are your real opinion. I grieve &#x02026; the desolation of dear beautiful Paris &#x00026; hope her children may yet return to order.&#x0201D;</note> But too evidently it has infinite delirium, vainglorious unveracity and open disregard of the Laws of God and Man to cast out of it, with sore travail enough, before any real prosperity or well-doing can return to it. Few persons, I believe, perhaps <hi rend="italic">au fond</hi> [deep down] not you yourself, have a deeper sense of the beautiful graceful and shining qualities Nature has lodged in the French; but except in <hi rend="italic">conforming</hi>, in perpetually striving to conform to the Laws which Nature has eternally appointed, no Nation can prosper, or at length can exist at all in this world. Alas, my com&#x000AF;on idea, withal, is, that England&#x2019;s turn must come next, and that, in exact proportion to England&#x2019;s folly, wickedness and worldly baseness, must England&#x2019;s disasters and disgraces like-wise be. And often it strikes me moreover that the hour cannot now be distant, and is fast hastening on. But let us quit these sad considerations; too dismal to be dwelt on here,&#x02014;or elsewhere, if one could help it.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-47-199" n="47:199"/>I can really hope you will soon see the &#x0201C;Purchase System&#x0201D;<note n="6" noteref="936">See <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710210-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1871-02-10">10 Feb.</date></ref></note>
 put an end to,&#x02014;though that England will thereupon get a real Army, as every Nation ought to have, I can by no means believe. England, I sorrowfully calculate, will have to change its ways, parliamentary and other, a good deal, and that to an extent she little thinks of, before that can arrive!&#x02014; But at all events in September or October next we can hope your interest in it will substantially be set at rest. This is a little bit of blessing which we can thankfully appropriate. You are then to be free of Army matters and free to choose a residence where you please.<note n="7" noteref="937">Phillipps wrote: &#x0201C;I have been here with my youngest daughter since Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last. Her husband&#x2019;s regiment is here &#x00026; here we shall remain till this new state of army regulations gives him his next step without purchase &#x00026; then I shall be free, free to live where &#x00026; how as I please&#x02014; Dover will not be the place, if my life is preserved till then (w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I think will be about September or October). Dover is so cold that I have spent all the winter coughing&#x02014;my old weakness of lungs is returned upon me.&#x0201D;</note> Let us hope it may not be too far from London and the old scenes connected with your young history,&#x02014;and not too inaccessible to the old friends, especially to one old Friend who still lingers in that region, and cannot now calculate on lingering long!&#x02014; I have been decidedly below par in point of health,&#x02014;got sensibly hurt by the puddles and rages of last winter (the first winter that ever did sensibly hurt me); have twice or thrice fancied I was recovering since Spring came; but have never yet been able quite to do it. However I still keep hoping, keep endeavouring.</p>
<p>My little Niece is still here, as you perceive; still helps me faithfully all she can. I am to send her kind regards to you; my own you are at all times assured of. Do you never come to London? If so why do you neglect to call or warn us?</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your little Note came duly to me here; almost the only one I have yet had,&#x02014;for except the farewell note from Maggie Welsh, wh. enclosed 2 splendid looking American Letters, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren forwarded nothing, and all manner of trash, no doubt daily accumulating, lies comfortably out of my sight for the time being. Nay the splendid Yankee Letters themselves contained nothing but more or less impudent requests for Autographs and had the destiny of merely lighting pipes. There is something really comfortable in living day after day without any letters at all from such impertinent correspondents as mine usually consist of.</p>
<p>It is not for want of thinking of you all that I have written nothing in answer to your Note; but the truth is I am so overwhelmed with mournful languour total indisposition to write or even to speak if I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get it well helped, that I have absolutely written<note n="1" noteref="947">TC inserted &#x0201C;2&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;1&#x0201D; above the words to indicate that &#x0201C;absolutely written&#x0201D; should be reversed.</note> nothing at all till this moment; &#x00026; shall probably write nothing till forced by something on getting back to Chelsea. I read almost nothing either, &#x00026; in fact do nothing; but am content to look upon <hi rend="italic">being in the open air</hi>, sitting walking, being driven through the New Forest<note n="2" noteref="948">The New Forest, large area of unenclosed land, mainly in SW Hampshire, S of Melchet.</note> sceneries (and one day) riding a too a firey horse in hope of benifit from that variety of inaction wh. however I have not repeated hitherto. Tourgu&#x000E9;neff came duly on Monday; but unhappily had to go again on Wednesday morning<note n="3" noteref="949">Ivan Turgenev visited Melchet <date when="1871-05-08">8</date>&#x02013;<date when="1871-05-10">10 May</date>.</note> I say unhappily not only because he is really a friendly intelligent man, a general favourite with high &#x00026; low, but because he entirely relieved me from any labour of talking; being himself a most copious &#x00026; entertaining talker,&#x02014;by far the best I have ever heard who talks so much.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We got home yesternight between 8 &#x00026; 9 without accident of any kind:&#x02014;we did indeed aim at starting 2 hours earlier, but by disrespect for the rigorous nature of Time (which it is the custom at Melchet too much to treat as an elastic entity), arrived at Romsey<note n="1" noteref="964">Romsey Station, the junction on the London and South-Western railway line nearest to Melchet.</note>
 some minutes after our train had passed; and were obliged, Mary &#x00026; I, to saunter about in the lanes &#x00026; shady places for a 2 hours &#x00026; more, waiting next train; but found the time slip easily enough, &#x00026; the actual journey in all its details a quite successful affair.</p>
<p>People say, as their wont is, I have an air of great improvement; I myself feel that perhaps I am a little improved; certainly I don&#x2019;t feel worse; and <pb id="pg-47-205" n="47:205"/>the 17 days of pure air on the hill tops &#x00026; quiet lanes were beyond dispute a healthier element than noisy dusty Chelsea; and at all events were a new one. I have yet seen nobody; indeed am very busy getting into the poor old harness again; dealing with the litter that has accumulated in this absence. To you is the first Note I write, which will enclose at least the 2 Letters, Butler&#x2019;s<note n="2" noteref="965">Charles Butler (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x02013;<date when="97">97</date>); see <ref target="volume-45/ed-45-biographical-notes"><sic>45:223</sic></ref>. Butler had looked after TC&#x2019;s American investments until <date when="1868">1868</date>; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680506-TC-CBU-01"><sic>45:125&#x02013;26</sic><corr>TC to CBU, <date when="1868-05-06">6 May 1868</date></corr></ref>. John A. Carlyle and Butler continued to correspond. John wrote to Butler, <date when="1871-06-06">6 June</date>: &#x0201C;The stay of three weeks &#x02026; at Melchet proved very beneficial, &#x00026; my brother looks fully as well as usual. &#x02026; He bids me send his very kindest regards to you, &#x00026; say that he intends to send you a book of which the last volume is not yet quite ready. He has always a very lively sense of your kindness &#x00026; the pleasure he had in seeing you while you were in this country.&#x0201D;</note> and Alick&#x2019;s;<note n="3" noteref="966">Their brother Alexander.</note> the latter of which was left lying by a small mistake of mine or Mary&#x2019;s. The house is very quiet; all things clear &#x00026; clean; and will be the eligiblest of lodgings I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think till the weather grow too hot. Your room upstairs is in perfect readiness, and, I think, will be found to have gained by the Peabody frontage.<note n="4" noteref="967">Peabody Mansions, Lawrence St., Chelsea, completed April 1870; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18691023-TC-JAC-01"><sic>46:94</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1869-10-23">23 Oct. 1869</date></corr></ref>. Lawrence St. is parallel to Cheyne Row. John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s bedroom was on the 2nd (3rd in U.S.) floor at the front (see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680921-TC-JSK-01"><sic>45:173</sic><corr>TC to JSK, <date when="1868-09-21">21 Sept. 1868</date></corr></ref>), presumably overlooking the rear of Peabody Mansions. Peabody Estates were founded by George Peabody (<date when="1795">1795</date>&#x02013;<date when="1869">1869</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21664"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), to provide housing for the deserving poor.</note> Pray let one hear of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> plans immediately, so far as they have yet come into shape.<note n="5" noteref="968">John replied, <date when="1871-05-24">24 May</date>: &#x0201C;My plans like yours are still undecided, except that I purpose going to see you at Chelsea again early next week if all goes well.&#x0201D;</note>
 Mine hitherto are hanging very much in the vague. Lady Ashburton indeed has been talking about Yachts &#x00026; sea Voyages, for weeks past; the very day before we left she had a fine little programme about going to the Island of Lewis (beautiful silent Isle placed far amid the melancholy main);<note n="6" noteref="969">Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, about 43 mi.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thursday is as good for us as any day; we will expect you then, about what hour you may appoint,&#x02014;or any other day d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>.<note n="1" noteref="980">John A.

Once ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>!&#x02014;&#x0201D; (TC&#x2019;s journal; privately owned).

<p>After one or two very bad nights, I have had three of what may fairly be counted beyond the average; and I begin again to think I may be actually improving in this fine Summer weather. Hope springs eternal in the human breast.<note n="2" noteref="981">See Alexander Pope, <hi rend="italic">An Essay on Man</hi> (<date when="1733">1733</date>&#x02013;<date when="34">34</date>) 1.95.</note></p>
<p>Last night we were at Forster&#x2019;s dining. Poor F. has had a bad turn lately; sudden staggering on the street, and would have fallen had he not caught by the railing,&#x02014;evidently something in the head; which has considerably alarmed him; and even the ever-hoping D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain,<note n="3" noteref="982">Richard Quain; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700722-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1870-07-22">22 July 1870</date></ref>.</note>
 though he persists in calling it &#x0201C;congestion of the liver&#x0201D;; seems clearly to have his own apprehensions on the subject, and enjoins earnestly on Forster less labour for the brain. I never saw poor F. so dull as last night; he is to go (&#x0201C;if possible&#x0201D; which was to be considered today) on his Business Tour, along with a comrade Official,<note n="4" noteref="983">Not further identified. Forster&#x2019;s work as a Lunacy Commissioner took him traveling around the country.</note> tomorrow morning: his good little Wife too, in speaking to Mary, was in great anxiety. The recent fate of Landseer,<note n="5" noteref="984">Sir Edwin Landseer (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x02013;<date when="1873">73</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15984"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), artist, had been suffering from bouts of insanity. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported, <date when="1871-05-01">1 May</date>, remarks of Sir Francis Grant (<date when="1803">1803</date>&#x02013;<date when="1878">78</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11257"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), president of the Royal Academy, <date when="1871-04-29">29 April</date>: &#x0201C;The protracted and distressing illness of Sir Edwin Landseer has been a source of great sorrow and anxiety to the members of the Academy.&#x0201D;</note> and indeed the case itself, naturally gives rise to such feelings. I do trust and pray that nothing of all these sinister forebodings will take effect; but that caution, moderation and the Summer air, for the next three weeks, will work a favourable change for poor Forster. Certainly a more obliging, helpful man to all the help-needing, especially to myself (whether falling under that category or not) I have no where met with. Last night, for the first time, what I noted as a bad symptom, he did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> say anything of me or my Chapman or other affairs; but dwelt mainly on his own, <pb id="pg-47-208" n="47:208"/>especially on a Biography of Dickens.<note n="6" noteref="985">John Forster, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Charles Dickens</hi> (<date when="1872">1872</date>&#x02013;<date when="74">74</date>).</note> One thing he seemed even to have forgotten his promise about, and did not allude to at all. Near a month ago he had promptly undertaken to see Mr Harding<note n="7" noteref="986">Robert Palmer Harding; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701013-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1870-10-13">13 Oct. 1870</date></ref>. Forster had offered in <date when="1870-11">Nov. 1870</date> (see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701112-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1870-11-12">12 Nov. 1870</date></ref>) to try and help in the matter of John Aitken applying to Harding for work; presumably he had repeated the offer more recently.</note> himself, and confidentially ascertain from him whether he did mean anything practical with Nephew John, in regard to that Clerkship or merely a polite dismissal of the thing (as nephew Jim thought,<note n="8" noteref="987">For James Aitken Jr.&#x2019;s view, see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701217-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1870-12-17">17 Dec. 1870</date></ref>.</note>
 and doubtless still thinks). Of course I took no notice last night; but I do design not to let the matter drop; and either thro&#x2019; Chapman, Harding himself, or some other channel, shall hope to be at the bottom of the matter now before long.</p>
<p>Of Lady Ashburton, we have heard nothing definite, far less seen, Her Ladyship since Monday last. She is of flighty fitful habit in her appointments,&#x02014;this we already knew!&#x02014; She was to have been here on Wednesday on &#x00026;c (passing thro&#x2019; Town on some visit to a sick Friend);<note n="9" noteref="988">Unidentified.</note> I called yesterday at her house, found she had not come till Friday, was to return &#x0201C;tomorrow&#x0201D;; i.e, today, and be home at Melchet tonight; in short we <hi rend="italic">may</hi> see her today or not see; and she is still an unknown quantity, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yet eliminated farther, in our equation! That probably will come in good time however.</p>
<p>Today I bought a <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>; struck by these unexampled horrors that have been going on in Paris;<note n="10" noteref="989">During the Franco-Prussian War, Paris was under siege, and the new National Assembly, under Adolphe Thiers, moved to Tours; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710225-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1871-02-25">25 Feb.</date></ref> Paris then came under the control of the radical socialist Paris Commune, backed by the national guard, <date when="1871-03-18">18 March</date>; TC had been particularly shocked to hear of the murder on that day by the national guards of their commandant, J.

I will state more in detail hereafter, what ravages have been committed by the flames&#x02014;but one can see at once that nothing can exceed the wickedness of the designs of the Commune. Paris shall not exist, if Paris does not belong to the Commune&#x02014;such is their hellish resolve; and they proceed to carry out their threat of destroying the capital which they could not retain.&#x0201D;</note> but I gained no glimmer of real instruction from my penny worth <hi rend="italic">there</hi>; and indeed am much in the dark about the real meaning of all these quaisi-infernal Bedlamisms; upon which no Newspaper that I look into has anything to say, except &#x0201C;horrible and shameful!&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;Oh Lord, I thank Thee that we Englishmen are not as other men!&#x0201D; One thing I can see in these murderous ragings by the poorest classes in Paris, that they are a tremendous <pb id="pg-47-209" n="47:209"/>Proclamation to the Upper classes in all countries, &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Our</hi> condition, after 82 years of struggling, Oh ye quack Upper Classes, is still unimproved, more intolerable, from year to year and from revolution to revolution; and by the Eternal Powers, if you cannot mend it we will blow the world up, along with ourselves and you!&#x0201D;<note n="11" noteref="990">TC refers to the mood of the &#x0201C;poorest classes&#x0201D; in France after finding no improvement from the beginning of the French Revolution, <date when="1789">1789</date>, to the present.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your Letter gave me great pleasure. A gleam of sunshine after a long tract of of<note n="1" noteref="996">Word repeated.</note>
 lowering weather. It is not you that are to blame for this sad gap in our correspondence; it is I,<note n="2" noteref="997">Emerson wrote, <date when="1871-04-10">10 April</date>: &#x0201C;I fear there is no pardon from you, none from myself, for this immense new gap in our correspondence.&#x0201D;</note> or rather it is my misfortune, and miserable inabilities, broken resolutions &#x00026;c &#x00026;c. The truth is the winter here was very unfriendly to me; broke ruinously into my sleep; and through that into every other department of my businesses, spiritual and temporal; so that from about New-year&#x2019;s Day last I have been, in a manner, good for nothing,&#x02014;nor am yet, <pb id="pg-47-210" n="47:210"/>though I do again feel as if the beautiful Summer weather might perhaps do something for me. This it was that choked every enterprize; and postponed your Letter, week after week, through so many months. Let us not speak of it farther!</p>
<p>Note, meanwhile, I have no disease about me; nothing but the gradual decay of any poor digestive faculty I latterly had,&#x02014;or indeed ever had since I was three and twenty years of age. Let us be quiet with it; accept it as a mode of exit, of which always there must be <hi rend="italic">some</hi> mode.</p>
<p>I have got done with all my press-correctings, editionings and paltry bother of that kind: vol 30 will embark for you about the middle of this month; there are then to follow (&#x0201C;uniform,&#x0201D; as the printer&#x2019;s call it, though in smaller type) a little vol. called <hi rend="italic">General Index</hi> and 3 more voll. of <hi rend="italic">Translations from the German</hi>;&#x02014;after which we two will reckon and count; and if there is any <hi rend="italic">lacuna</hi> on the Concord shelf, at once make it good.<note n="3" noteref="998">Emerson wrote: &#x0201C;Meantime, you have been monthly loading me with good for evil. I have just counted 23 vols. of Carlyle&#x2019;s Library Edition, in order, on my shelves, besides 2, or perhaps 3, which Ellery Channing has borrowed.

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>If it were not for your formidable Railway Station,<note n="1" noteref="1020">TC presumably meant the noise of the railways around Dumfries; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700704-TC-JMN-01">TC to Sir JMN, <date when="1870-07-04">4 July 1870</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700722-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1870-07-22">25 July</date><!-- print edn. has JAF and 25 July --></ref>.</note> I feel as if I would almost rush off to you this very day. For ten days past I have been in such a state of &#x0201C;health&#x0201D; as I never knew in my life before. It is indeed a matter of six months not of 10 days; but on Wed. gone a week it came to a crisis; by various accidents that day, by cold East wind, indigestable dinner, and a carpenter<note n="2" noteref="1021">Probably Frederick Freure (b. <date when="1835">1835</date>), who had worked for the Carlyles since at least <date when="1864">1864</date>; see <ref target="volume-41/ed-41-biographical-notes"><sic>41:231</sic><corr>41:biographical notes</corr></ref>.</note> taking to splitting sticks within earshot of me, I found before bedtime that I had got a new dose of cold (coughing and <hi rend="italic">clochering</hi> ever since and still going on); and all capacity of eating food as nearly as possible in complete abeyance ever since. For a long time all food had been as physic to me; swallowed from duty not desire; but for the last 6 days I have been obliged to renounce eating solid food altogether (cannot prevail upon myself to look where cooked beef or mutton is). I swallow in large draughts my basin of brown soup and fly out of the way of dinner altogether. You can fancy what a vigorous condition of body and of soul this indicates; and how pressing the necessity is to get out of it without delay,&#x02014;to change one&#x2019;s place in it, if getting out be a vain chimera!&#x02014; I ought to add that of heart sickness I intrinsically feel nothing; and what will surprise you that I oftener sleep than otherwise; such the entire weariness and prostration, and am surprised for the last 3 mornings to find how little strength or benefit the fair amount of sleep has yielded me.</p>
<p>Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s plans have all gone to windy uncertainty; and nothing is left me but what plans I can form for myself. John proposes we should go next Wed. towards the Orkney Islands no less by Aberdeen Steamer; and tho&#x2019; the venture seems sharp for one in this skinless condition, I rather feel inclined to try it; my actual condition as you see being plainly unendurable. &#x0201C;To try a sail again,&#x0201D; let us at least execute that. If the Orknies prosper we should have more sailing; come round by the west coast &#x00026;c &#x00026;c; and I think it likely I should land at Dumfries any way in one form or another of stranded goods.</p>
<p>Besides sailing, there is only one other measure from which I have ever expected benefit, that of riding. I tried it at Melchet, on a high-going, rough-paced, almost intolerable horse, 3 times lately; and it seemed clearly to do me more good than anything else. What I practically want of you today therefore, <pb id="pg-47-215" n="47:215"/>is that you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> make a little serious enquiry as to my possibilities for getting a horse to carry me about while among me.<note n="3" noteref="1022">Mary wrote &#x0201C;me&#x0201D; instead of &#x0201C;you.&#x0201D;</note> John and Mary both agree with me in thinking that you ought to question young Jamie of Craigenputtock on the subject and report to me what his counsel is. I am perfectly willing to buy a horse and pay the proper price for a good one, about 14 hands or so, with good sure paces: your own James knows very well the kind of thing that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> suit; and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> perhaps is the person you had best consult about it. Do what you find wisest in that small matter;&#x02014;and excuse this long <hi rend="italic">clish maclaver</hi>, which is due purely to the vice of dictating; had my own right hand been still mine I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have written in 5 lines what here occupies as many pages. So soon as any project comes to execution you shall at once hear.&#x02014; My blessing with you and all the house.</p>

Dr. Quain (for he has been twice or thrice to see me) seemed to prescribe this as the next stage in his treatment; all my acquaintances have been here daily asking, &#x0201C;When are you to go?&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Are you not to go on such a day?&#x0201D; So that, in mere self-defence, I had half desperately to decide as above. After Aberdeen, it would appear, there are Steamers for the Orkneys, for the Shetlands;<note n="3" noteref="1029">The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> advertised, <date when="1871-06-03">3 June</date>: &#x0201C;TO TOURISTS.&#x02014;Steam to CAITHNESS and the Isles of ORKNEY and SHETLAND twice a week from EDINBURGH and ABERDEEN by the steamship ST. MAGNUS, ST. CLAIR and QUEEN. &#x02026; Fares very low.&#x0201D;</note> Steamers that go through the Pentland Firth, and shew you the Western Isles, all down to Glasgow; Steamers enough; but a very dubious reception in them for the like of me in my present mood! However, I have long had, or have long talked about, the notion of benefit from a Sea-voyage, and now, if ever, may really be the time for trying it. I am fairly a little better than when you left me; but only a little; and indeed feel generally weaker, and less fit for taking things in the rough, than almost ever in my life before.</p>
<p>After Aberdeen and the Sea-voyaging there remains to me, much approved by Quain, a second, somewhat hopefuller project, that of getting into some soft quiet friendly place, and taking to a spell of daily riding. Into this latter project beneficent Holne Park, with its quiet woods and waters, and loved and loving Friends,<note n="4" noteref="1030">Holne Park, nr.

If there were a gentle riding horse procurable (still more if there were <hi rend="italic">two</hi>), Holne Park would be in reality, of all places now known to me, the likeliest. That hope I will keep for the present, it is already a cheerful possession to me.</p>
<p>No more today; all being in a stir with packing. Mary I think goes to Dumfries next week.

He explained, when he saw me surprised, that it was an account of his wife&#x2019;s history, that it was incomplete, that he could himself form no opinion whether it ought to be published or not, that he could do no more to it, and must pass it over to me. He wished never to hear of it again. I must judge. I must publish it, the whole, or part&#x02014;or else destroy it all. &#x02026; I was to wait only until he was dead, and he was then in constant expectation of his end. &#x02026; I was then going into the country for the summer. I said that I would take the MS. with me, and either write to him or would give him an answer when we met in the autumn. &#x02026; I found that it consisted of a transcript of the &#x2018;Reminiscence&#x2019; of Mrs. Carlyle, which he had written immediately after her death, with a copy of the old direction of <date when="1866">1866</date>, that it was not to be published [<date when="1866-07-28">28 July 1866</date>; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 198&#x02013;99]. &#x02026; The rest was the collection of her own letters, &#x00026;c &#x02026; with notes, commentaries, and introductory explanations of his own. The perusal was infinitely affecting&#x0201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:408&#x02013;9).</note>&#x02014; With kindest regards to Mrs. Froude and all the Household,</p>

<salute>Dear Froude,</salute>
<p>Your second kind little Word from Holne Park reached me safely via Dumfries, three days ago. I would have answered at once had I had Mary as my Amanuensis, but could not: having none; till now as you will see, with a witness.</p>
<p>My brother &#x00026; I had a prosperous sail to Aberdeen&#x02014;prosperous though noisy &#x00026; confused;&#x02014;&#x00026; had a pleasant view of the old granite city, &#x00026; its brisk populations for a few hours till the Railway started with us for Inverness, for Dingwall, &#x00026; finally for this remote little paradise in the middle of the wild, rocky hills, &#x00026; torrents; where we lived, as yet no Hostess here, a week of the strangest most benignant solitude I have experienced for long. Hostess with complete equipments, &#x00026; with the warmest of welcomes, has come about ten days; brother John, has gone to the Wells of Strathpeffer to drink the sulphurous waters (much good may they do him) &#x00026; I am here;<note n="1" noteref="1037">TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1871-07-28">28 July</date>: &#x0201C;Chaos come ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> was, to the usual extent, the hist<hi rend="italic">y</hi> of our otherwise pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> voyage; and we did duly land on Aberd<hi rend="italic">n</hi> on Monday [<date when="1817-07-10">10 July</date>], not the worse for our rude tumblings;&#x02014;made for thrice habitable Loch Luichart,&#x02014;where have been for us three of the strangest weeks in this bright solitude (for myself 3, for John 2, who shifted to Strathpeffer on Monday last), no <hi rend="italic">Hostess</hi> here for the first week, but only ready servants &#x00026; equip<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>, and a silence and a pure seclusion except from sky and earth,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> reminded me of Craigenp<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, and almost made me weep!&#x0201D; (TC&#x2019;s journal; privately owned).

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I have often longed to shoot a little word of enquiry towards you, but since the 7<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July, I have had no Secretary (Mary at Dumfries all this while;) &#x00026; I am obliged, as you see, to a foreign hand on this occasion.</p>
<p>I want, in brief, and truly want very much, to hear how it is with Madame &#x00026; you, where, how in regard to health &#x00026; otherwise you both now are,&#x02014;in short a little history of your events &#x00026; vicissitudes since the day I last saw you&#x02014;don&#x2019;t neglect to send it instantly;<note n="1" noteref="1053">Forster replied, <date when="1871-08-21">21 Aug.</date>: &#x0201C;This morning brings me your welcome letter, dear Carlyle, and, <hi rend="italic">only last night</hi>, myself went to Mrs. Warren for your address, it being my intention to write to you today: which in any case I should have done. I returned here on Friday night, after a weary absence of three weeks and upward. &#x02026; Of myself, &#x00026; the small one here, there is the usual mingled yarn.&#x0201D; He reported that his wife had not been very well, and continued: &#x0201C;My health has not been very brave but I have had no absolute break-down&#x02014;except in the way of sleep. How I have thought of you in the dreary watches!&#x0201D;</note> regardless of the languid cunctatory &#x00026; indeed quite torpid silence I have so long observed towards you, &#x00026; all other friends. You cannot fancy with what a spasm of remorseful endeavour I am now at last animated to write&#x02014;</p>
<p>My own history since landing at Aberdeen (prosperously enough, considering the tumults &#x00026; confusions of the Sea) may be comprised in three words. We made directly hitherwards, brother John &#x00026; I, <hi rend="italic">to end</hi> at once brother John&#x2019;s dubitations about Orkney, about Shetland, about Iceland &#x00026;c &#x00026;c, waited here some days till Mylady in person arrived; after which John took himself to the baths of Strath peffer, where he is still ducking, or drinking, &#x00026; I lay down in the most perfect envelopment of idleness, of soft kindness, &#x00026; in fact of unlimited cotton, spiritual &#x00026; physical which it is well possible to conceive (the fittest of all elements for a broken down old creature) where I still continue;<note n="2" noteref="1054">Richard Owen (<date when="1804">1804</date>&#x02013;<date when="1892">92</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21026"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), anatomist and palaeontologist, known to TC since <date when="1842">1842</date> (see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650512-TC-RO-01"><sic>42:19&#x02013;20</sic><corr>TC to RO, <date when="1865-05-12">12 May 1865</date></corr></ref>), was visiting John Fowler (<date when="1817">1817</date>&#x02013;<date when="1898">98</date>; <ref target="volume-47/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10011"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), railway engineer, at Braemore, Ross-shire; he wrote to his wife, Caroline Amelia, b.

Lady A. intimated it was mainly his wish to see me that brought them so far. He painfully, with a pencil, put his name in the Visitors&#x2019; Book&#x0201D; (Richard S.

<p>Your kind present of Grouse, I have authentically heard, arrived in perfect preservation at Cheyne Row; &#x00026; though I myself at a distance of 500 miles could not bear a hand in eating it, it was turned to excellent account there in part, I believe, by friends whom I wished much to be good to&#x02014; Many thanks to you, &#x00026; to madam&#x02014;for this kind mark of your attention.</p>

<salute>Dear Froude,</salute>
 <p>Your friendly and affectionate Letter reached me above a week ago; and was read very gladly: I would have answered far sooner; but I was suddenly deprived of my <hi rend="italic">pen</hi>,&#x02014;that is to say, my good little Mary was suddenly summoned off to London with her Mother on the saddest of errands, and only returned last night; so that till now I could not write at all. Mary&#x2019;s eldest Brother, my poor Nephew &#x0201C;Jim,&#x0201D; an excellent, affectionate, loving, diligent and truthful young man, much loved by us all, who was settled in Liverpool of late years, and prospering honestly as Manager and Partner of a big London House there; had come up on business, Saturday gone a fortnight last, intending to return on Monday; on Saturday night returning to his quarters at a younger Brother&#x2019;s,<note n="1" noteref="1061">John Aitken, who was now working in London; the work with Robert Harding&#x2019;s firm (see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701013-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1870-10-13">13 Oct. 1870</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710529-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1870-05-29">29 May</date></ref>) had apparently not materialized, but he was apparently now working for Chapman &#x00026; Hall; see vol. 48.</note> who has come to London since you went away, and lodges in Brompton Road,&#x02014;got upon a Chelsea Omnibus at Cheapside, and rode beside the driver to the head of Sloane Street, where, being in haste to get down, and probably not knowing that the Chelsea Omnibuses turn <hi rend="italic">into</hi> Sloane St. before pausing, he appears to have sprung hastily from his seat, and <pb id="pg-47-226" n="47:226"/>in half jumping down (for he was in the flower of his strength and recklessly nimble of limb) caught a foot in the apron of the carriage, as is supposed, and came headlong down upon a street laid with new-broken stones, probably upon the sharp angle of one, and fractured his knee-pan (fracture both &#x0201C;compound &#x00026; comminuted&#x0201D;): one of the most tragic incidents I have ever known. For such a wound, I now understand, was probably fatal from the very first; and not even instant amputation could have saved him. He was carried to St. George&#x2019;s Hospital, totally insensible all night; not till next morning could he write a line in pencil to his Brother,&#x02014;the last he was to write in this world. We were all of course thrown into consternation at this news; but foolishly kept hoping till at length one bad telegram came to the effect that Mary and his Mother ought to come up at once. Which they at once did, deeply to his satisfaction; and thrice deeply now to their own for the rest of their lives. Though labouring for most part under continual clouds of hallucination, his intellect, his affections and his courage were essentially as clear as ever: he appears to have behaved himself with a beautiful simple magnanimity; to have known for the last six days that the end was here, and to have met it in a way that one cannot but lovingly honour. They had removed him into an Apartment all his own; and the nursing and attendance on him has filled his poor Mother&#x2019;s heart with gratitude and surprise. He died on Wednesday 9.20 p.m.;<note n="2" noteref="1062">Wed. was <date when="1871-09-20">20 Sept.</date> James Aitken Jr.&#x2019;s death was announced in the obituary column of the <hi rend="italic">Liverpool Mercury</hi>, <date when="1871-09-25">25 Sept.</date>, as on <date when="1871-09-21">21 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;A<hi rend="small-caps">itken</hi>,&#x02014;<date when="1870-09-21">Sept. 21</date>, at St. George&#x2019;s Hospital, London, from the effects of an accident, James Carlyle Aitken, son of James Aitken, The Hill, Dumfries.&#x0201D;</note> Mother and surviving Brother returned early yesterday morning, Mary who had gone round by Liverpool not till night;&#x02014;the funeral was yesterday at noon (all wisely and beautifully adjusted, I think by my dear little Mary mainly); and all is now over; all of work that we could do <hi rend="italic">done</hi>; and only the suffering and sorrow now to deal with. It has of course made a dismal house here,<note n="3" noteref="1063">TC wrote about Jim&#x2019;s death in his journal, <date when="1870-12-05">5 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;Dismal sudden tragedy there [Dumfries]: accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, at London, to poor &#x2018;Jim&#x2019; (Mary&#x2019;s eldest Bro<hi rend="italic">r</hi>): sudden summons thither of Mary and her poor Mother; return of them in few days with the Body of their Dead Loved One:&#x02014;one of the saddest and cruelest-looking calamities I ever was concerned in&#x0201D; (TC&#x2019;s journal; privately owned).</note>&#x02014;concerning all which I need say no more. The sad Story itself I thought <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had a right to hear from me; and now all is said.</p>
<p>I was myself minded to have been in Chelsea before this; but now mean to stay a day or two long[er]; day of departure not yet fixed but some day this week it must be; I rejoice much in the prospect of seeing you in ten days farther; indeed I may say it is the chief attraction London now has for me. I pray Heaven your little &#x0201C;Rose&#x0201D; may not be doomed to go abroad; and that we shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> forfeit a season of walks; of which there can now so few remain <pb id="pg-47-227" n="47:227"/>for that painful reason.<note n="4" noteref="1064">Presumably Froude thought he might have to take his da. Rose abroad for her health.</note>&#x02014; I have never been so long from home before; what benefit I have gained is still uncertain, though benefit there surely is more or less. I have had the usual continuity of difficulties and sufferings about sleep; but did lazily taste somewhat the solitary Lotus-eating life of the Highlands; had a week of beautiful beneficial Sea-bathing in the Isle of Skye; was picked up there by a Glasgow Steamer, and conveyed through these strange and mournfully beautiful Hebrides Isles and their many sounding Seas in the space of a day and night to Oban and Greenock;<note n="5" noteref="1065">Oban, port on the W coast of mainland Scotland, 93 mi.

I felt considerably better at first; but begin to suspect, that might be in good part the effect of novelty and beautiful environment, outward and inward.

<p>It gives me real pleasure to see you so interested and ardently diligent about your Irish Book;<note n="7" noteref="1067">Froude was currently working on <hi rend="italic">The English in Ireland</hi>; the first vol. was pbd. <date when="1872">1872</date>, the second and third vols. <date when="1874">1874</date>.</note> there is not a doubt you will make an interesting two Volumes of it, and set the matter in a new light, new and profitable to the Eng-lish mind; which infinitely needs instruction in that matter.&#x02014; I long much with a tremulous deep and almost painful feeling about that other manuscript, which you were kind enough to read at the very first.<note n="8" noteref="1068">The MSS of JWC&#x2019;s letters and of TC&#x2019;s reminiscences of her; see TC&#x2019;s <date when="1871">1871</date> Will, <date when="1871-04-06">6 April</date>, and TC to JAF, <date when="1871-07-07">7 July</date>.</note> Be prepared to tell me, with all your candour, the <hi rend="italic">pros</hi> and <hi rend="italic">contras</hi> there.<note n="9" noteref="1069">Froude wrote later: &#x0201C;When I saw him again after the summer we talked the subject over with the fullest confidence.

I told him that, so far as I could then form an opinion, I thought that the letters <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be published, provided the prohibition was withdrawn against publishing his own Memoir of Mrs. Carlyle. &#x02026; It would have been hard on both of them if the sharp censures of Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s pen [in her letters] had been left unrelieved. To this Carlyle instantly assented. The copy of the Memoir &#x02026; [was] among the other papers, that I might make use of it if I liked &#x02026; but I required, and I received, a direct permission to print it&#x0201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:411&#x02013;12). For TC&#x2019;s view that Froude should consult John A. Carlyle and Forster, see TC&#x2019;s <date when="1871">1871</date> Will, <date when="1871-04-06">6 April.</date> Froude &#x0201C;presumed that John Carlyle was acquainted with his brother&#x2019;s intentions, and would communicate with me on the subject if he wished to do so&#x0201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:412); he gave the papers to Forster for his consideration: &#x0201C;He, if any one, could say whether so open a revelation of the life at Cheyne Row was one which ought to be made. Forster read the letters. I suppose that he felt as uncertain as I had done, the reasons against the publication being so obvious and so weighty. &#x02026; To me at any rate he gave no opinion at all. He merely said that he would talk to Carlyle himself, and would tell him that he must make my position perfectly clear in his will, or trouble would certainly arise about it. Nothing more passed between Forster and myself upon the subject. Carlyle, however, in the will which he made two years later bequeathed the MS. to me specifically in terms of the tenderest confidence&#x0201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:413); for TC&#x2019;s Will, <date when="1873-02-06">6 Feb. 1873</date> (this was TC&#x2019;s formal and witnessed will, along with the codicil of <date when="1878-11-08">8 Nov. 1878</date>), see Froude, <hi rend="italic">My Relations</hi> 71&#x02013;77.</note></p>
