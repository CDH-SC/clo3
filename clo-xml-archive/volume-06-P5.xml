<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Allow me to present to you my Brother Dr Carlyle, who is at present on his way to Italy; and wishes, in passing thro&#x2019; Paris, to make acquaintance with you. He is charged on my part, and feels induced by his own inclination to familiarise himself as far as possible with the actual aspects of the Doctrine of St. Simon. With your German relatives you will find him already in friendly connexion.</p>
<p>I am regularly favoured with the Numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Globe;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Le Globe</hi> had become the daily newspaper of the Saint-Simonians in <date when="1828-11-00">Nov. 1828</date>, and in <date when="1831-01-00">Jan. 1831</date> it changed its sub-title from <hi rend="italic">Journal philosophique et litt&#xE9;raire</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Journal de la doctrine Saint-Simon</hi>. Copies were sent regularly to key figures that the leaders of the movement wished to win over.</note> and derive from them not a little information on various matters that interest me much and are imperfectly or not at all understood here. Partly by way of testifying my thankfulness for this kindness, I had resolved on sending you an English version of the <hi rend="italic">Nouveau Christianisme</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301219-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-12-19">19 Dec. 1830</date></ref>; <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320215-TC-GE-01">TC to GE, <date when="1832-02-15">15 Feb. 1832</date></ref>. Although Carlyle&#x2019;s translation was not published and his MS has disappeared, there is an English translation by Rev. James E. Smith, <hi rend="italic">New Christianity</hi> (London, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>).</note> which I executed many months ago in Scotland: but the Manuscript which is in Dr Bowring&#x2019;s hands cannot be procured at this moment, and must wait another opportunity. If on any occasion it could be of service to you, it is heartily at your disposal.</p>
<p>A small piece of literary business brought me hither several weeks ago; and now, such is the turn matters have taken, I have sent for my wife, and we are to spend the winter here. Should your promised Apostolic Mission take place within the next three months we shall expect to have the earliest notice of your arrival, and to see you frequently with us. It will give me the greatest pleasure to confer with you to all lengths on the great matters you are engaged in: neither for yourself personally will a warm welcome be wanting.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310517-TC-GE-01">TC to GE, <date when="1831-05-17">17 May</date></ref>. As R. K. P. Pankhurst points out in <hi rend="italic">The Saint Simonians, Mill and Carlyle</hi> (London, [<date when="1957-00-00">1957</date>]), Carlyle and Mill were not alone in welcoming d&#x2019;Eichthal, nor was Carlyle alone in translating the publications of the Saint-Simonians. See also J. S. Mill to d&#x2019;Eichthal, Mineka, XII, 72&#x2013;73.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am much obliged to you for Godwin&#x2019;s Book,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310904-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-09-04">4 Sept.</date></ref></note> which I have read, and shall probably make use of in the way anticipated.

The copy in the British Museum rather excites curiosity than satisfies it.</p>
<p>Whenever Mr Napier&#x2019;s Copy arrives will you, therefore, have the goodness to send it hither as you proposed.</p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>On Saturday gone a week I had the honour to write to you about that Manuscript of mine. Not receiving any answer I am afraid the Note may have miscarried.</p>
<p>My request was that in case you consented to engage in a new treaty with regard to that work, you would let me know at what time I might look for your decision; if no time could be fixed, then (<hi rend="italic">my</hi> time being very limited, and much of it already spent) I desired to have the <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. forthwith returned.</p>
<p>Pray have the goodness to let me hear from you on this matter as <pb id="pg-06-05" n="06:05"/>speedily as possible. I am sorry to seem importunate, but Time, as I said, will not wait.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have received the <hi rend="italic">Ms.,</hi> with your Note, and your friend&#x2019;s criticism; and find it all safe and right.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray&#x2019;s note, simply dated Thursday and apparently written on the morning of <date when="1831-10-06">6 Oct.</date>, reads as follows:<lb/><lb/>
My Dear Sir<lb/>
The instant that I received your former note, I sent your MSS to a Gentleman in the highest class of Men of Letters&#x2014;and, an accomplished German Scholar&#x2014; I, now, inclose his opinion of your work, which you may rely upon it, is a just one&#x2014;and I have too high an opinion of your good sense to suppose, that you will be offended at my communicating it to your self.<lb/><lb/>
The writer of this MSS requires only a little more tact to write a popular as well as an able work&#x2014;&#x26; then I hope to be allowed to communicate with you with more gratification to both of us&#x2014; In the mean time I thank you for your patience and remain<lb/><lb/>
My dear Sir&#x2014;Your sincere wellwisher / and obliged Servant / John Murray<lb/><lb/>
It has usually been assumed that the reader to whom Murray had sent the MS was John Gibson Lockhart. The reader&#x2019;s opinion, enclosed in Murray&#x2019;s letter and printed in the appendix of many later editions of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, ran as follows: &#x201C;The Author of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi> is a person of talent; his work displays here and there some felicity of thought and expression, considerable fancy and knowledge: but whether or not it would take with the public seems doubtful. For a <foreign><hi rend="italic">jeu d&#x2019;esprit</hi></foreign> of that kind, it is too long; it would have suited better as an essay or article than as a volume. The Author has no great tact: his wit is frequently heavy; and reminds one of the German Baron who took to leaping on tables, and answered that he was learning to be lively. <hi rend="italic">Is</hi> the work a translation?&#x201D;<lb/><lb/>
It seems clear that Carlyle acknowledged Murray&#x2019;s note and the returned MS immediately.</note></p>
<p>In conclusion allow me to thank you for your punctuality and courtesy in this part of the business; and to join cordially in the hope you express that, in some fitter case, a closer relation may arise between us.</p>

<p>[From JWC:]</p>
<salute>My dear Mother</salute>
<p>The newspaper would give you assurance that I was arrived in London, and in a condition to write your name; but further particulars concerning myself and the barrel, you are still anxiously waiting for, and now that I find myself at liberty to write, it were inhuman to keep you longer in suspense.</p>
<p>To begin with the beginning&#x2014; After leaving you all with a sad enough heart, and com<supplied>[m]</supplied>itting myself to the mercy of the waves, my case was none of the pleasantest&#x2014; Alick recommended me to go down to the cabin till the vessel got underway&#x2014;and I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> no more of the sea till I stepped on shore at Liverpool. It was very stormy, and I was mortally sick the whole twenty four hours. Happily there was no cabin-passenger besides myself. So I had &#x2018;ample room and verge enough&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gray, &#x201C;The Bard,&#x201D; l, 52.</note> to make what demonstrations I pleased. My cousin Alick<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her uncle John Welsh&#x2019;s son.</note> was waiting for me on the dock with a hackney coach which in a few minutes landed me with my trunks &#x26;c at my Uncles&#x2014;one of his men took the barrel in a cart to the office from which it was to be forwarded by the canal. They were all very glad to see me at Maryland Street&#x2014;and feeling entirely exhausted with my sea-sickness I stupidly let myself be persuaded not to proceed till the Wednesday.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1831-09-28">28 Sept.</date></note> And by Wednesday I was in worse <foreign><hi rend="italic">fettle</hi></foreign> for travelling than when I arrived for I had almost no sleep the whole time of my stay owing to a Lady in the same room snoring like ten steam engines. My seat was taken in a coach that came straight thro&#x2019; so that I had no shifting of luggage to embar<supplied>[r]</supplied>ass me. My travelling companions were two irish Ladies&#x2014;who neither <hi rend="italic">picked my pocket of my purse nor watch.</hi> and twenty four hours after I started, I had the satisfaction of jumping out into Carlyle<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>s arms who with John was waiting for me at a certain Angel Inn&#x2014;you may imagine the sight of their faces among so many hundreds of strange <pb id="pg-06-8" n="06:8"/>ones was a joyful sight. They were both looking well&#x2014;John thin<supplied>[n]</supplied>ish but clear and healthy looking. They had a nice little dinner of chops and rice pudding in readiness&#x2014; Edward Irving came up in the evening and all was well&#x2014; But I was not to escape so easily&#x2014; The next day and the next my head was so ill I had to be in bed&#x2014; On Sunday I got out a little&#x2014;and saw the Montagus<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Mrs Basil Montague and Household (25. Bedford Square)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note). On Friday night [<date when="1831-09-30">30 Sept.</date>], the day after Jane&#x2019;s arrival in London, Mrs. Montagu had written the following note:<lb/><lb/>
<salute>My dear Child,</salute><lb/>
Are you <hi rend="italic">here?</hi> and safe and well?&#x2014; I shall not break in upon you, for I wish to see you first <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> at 25. Bedford Square, at <hi rend="italic">home,</hi> and when you are quite rested and can muster spirits to meet your disappointment, for disappointed you will be, or you are not the little romantic creature I take you for.&#x2014; When did a sober reality look like one of your air-drawn pictures?&#x2014; Prepare yourself for an old woman, sallow and severe, like the Abbess of some Nunnery in the old-times, not cold-hearted, but schooled into the suppression of her feelings&#x2014; I say this lest you should think I receive you coldly&#x2014;<lb/><lb/>
Let your Husband tell me you are here <hi rend="italic">verbally,</hi> and I shall be content (for tonight)<lb/><lb/>
Your faithful / friend / D. B. Montagu<lb/><lb/>
Jane has written at the top of the first page of this letter: &#x201C;Received on my arrival in London the night before I saw her for the first time.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; On Monday we were hunting after new lodgings&#x2014;George Irving&#x2019;s being intolerably noisy and still infested with bugs which few houses here are without. We succeeded in realizing a much better up-putting for the same money&#x2014;in the house of a M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Miles and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Page&#x2014;english people&#x2014;where I now write&#x2014; The barrel had arrived the end of the week and been unpacked&#x2014;so that our flitting was no such light matter. and occupied all Tuesday&#x2014; Yesterday I had a headach<supplied>[e]</supplied> again and to day is the first that I can call my own.</p>
<p>I hope we shall be very comfortable here&#x2014;the people are of a prepossessing appearance&#x2014;and the house is the only clean one I have seen since I left Scotland<supplied>[.]</supplied> We have a Drawingroom about the size of our own at Craigenputtoch&#x2014;more elegantly fitted up&#x2014;with a small but comfortable bedroom opening from it with large folding doors. it is in an airy and remarkably quiet street&#x2014;and the people assure us they <hi rend="italic">very seldom see</hi> a bug. I have no notion of London house keeping yet but am lying back till with &#x2018;weender and amazement.&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. &#x201C;Report of little Jean&#x2019;s, of some preacher who had profusely employed that locution, pronounced as here&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> I have reviewed the ground&#x2014;one fact I may mention as a sample potatoes are a penny a pound&#x2014;so that we pay three half pence for barely as many <pb id="pg-06-9" n="06:9"/>as we need&#x2014;the milk too is ridiculously dear and such stuff after Nooly&#x2019;s<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The cow at Craigenputtoch.</note>&#x2014; Thank Heaven we have good butter without running to the shops&#x2014; And Carlyle has fastened a lid with a padlock on the can&#x2014; But what place unites all the advantages of both town and country?</p>
<p>I have seen few people yet&#x2014;not even Jeffrey who is very ill&#x2014;confined to bed&#x2014; I was to have gone to him yesterday but could not for my head&#x2014; Carlyle and I are thinking to walk over tonight when his Ladies are at the House of Lords&#x2014;<supplied>[w]</supplied>hich will suit me best.</p>
<p>John set off on Tuesday Morning<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1831-10-04">4 Oct.</date></note> to join his Countess at Dover&#x2014;a newspaper has since intimated his safe arrival so far&#x2014; He was in good spirits for the enterprise and we hope it will be the beginning of much good for him&#x2014;</p>
<p>Carlyle is reading today with a view to writing an article&#x2014;to keep Mall&#x2014;in shaft&#x2014; They are not going to print the book after all&#x2014; Murray has lost heart lest it do not take with the public and so like a stupid ass as he is has sent back the manuscript<supplied>[.]</supplied> The <hi rend="italic">deevil</hi> may care it <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> be printed in spite of Murray some time and in the meanwhile it is not losing any of its worth by lying&#x2014;<name>Jane W Carlyle</name><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Ends abruptly, to save another line for me, and my lengthy postscript&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note></p>
<p>[From TC, <date when="1831-10-07">7 October</date>:]</p>
<p>My Dear Mother&#x2014;I expected to get a frank for this; but the Advocate is sick and bedfast for these two weeks, so that we cannot ask him. I judge that you will much rather pay the postage than wait longer. I received a short note for you from John yesterday, with another as short for myself: it contained nothing but affectionate blessings; intelligence that he had reached Dover in safety, and seen the Countess with satisfaction. They would sail on Wednesday morning, in three hours would be in France, and so I calculate are by this time far on the road to Paris. The whole expedition looked very promising, and I do hope it will turn to good for our poor Doctor, who has a true heart in him and great capabilities every way to do good service in his day and generation. Edward Irving took leave of him on Sabbath night, at the Church after preaching; led him into the vestry with his Elders, and there offered up a solemn prayer (I have no doubt, from the heart) that God might be with him, and bless him in his wayfarings. So be it!&#x2014; I am to hear again from Paris; and will soon <pb id="pg-06-10" n="06:10"/>transmit the tidings to you. I gave Jack a Letter to the St Simonians; he expects to pass some weeks in Paris and will see many pleasant &#x26; instructive things.</p>
<p>You are to remember that I calculated on getting a frank, and so writing you a whole Letter myself to go <hi rend="italic">along</hi> with this of Jane&#x2019;s which was ready last night: so you can get little good of me here.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His letter is crammed into the margins and between the lines of Jane&#x2019;s letter.</note> I will soon write again, with my usual minuteness. Meanwhile believe, dear Mother, that we are all right, and better than could be expected: our Lodging here is quite superior, without vermin, without noise; quite a dainty little place; my health has improved since the Wife came to look after me; I am about beginning to write something,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to an 8-page folio essay on Adolf M&#xfc;llner (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>), never published. The MS survives in the Beinecke Collection at Yale. Carlyle dates the beginning of it &#x201C;Saturday Noon, <date when="1831-10-09">9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> October, 1831</date>,&#x201D; and the end &#x201C;<date when="1831-10-21">21<hi rend="italic">st</hi> October</date>.&#x201D; At both the beginning and end he labels it a &#x201C;Dud.&#x201D; He describes M&#xfc;llner as a man not &#x201C;intrinsically of almost any value; a bullet-headed practising Advocate, who took to writing plays and by the steady exercise of other arts which he possessed, succeeded wonderfully in persuading multitudes of men falsely that he possessed <hi rend="italic">this</hi> one. &#x2026; On the whole a coarse thick-skinned Literary <hi rend="italic">Mastiff:</hi> worth little discussion for his own sake; worth <hi rend="italic">a</hi> little as a creature of the times.&#x201D; There are interesting comments on Goethe and other German writers in the essay. Carlyle had given considerable attention to M&#xfc;llner in &#x201C;German Playwrights,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review,</hi> <date when="1829-01-00">Jan. 1829</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXVI, 379 ff.</note> and can hope to spend the winter profitably and pleasantly enough. As for the Bookseller&#x2019;s refusal of my Book I care not a <foreign>doit</foreign> for it: I know what is wrong and what is right in the Book without his counsel; I will have it printed one day too: nay if it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be printed at all, I can still live and rejoice. By God&#x2019;s infinite grace I know what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am doing; let <hi rend="italic">them</hi> see what they are doing<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>Our address is: &#x201C;4. Ampton Street, Mecklenburg Square&#x201D;: I wish you had some means of communicating it to M&#x2019;Diarmid.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Editor of the Dumfries and Galloway <hi rend="italic">Courier:</hi> so that he could send the weekly copy directly to London.</note> Perhaps Alick can if he is still with you.</p>
<p>One little corner still remains for repeating my <hi rend="italic">questions</hi> after you, which I fear no one will soon answer. Bid some of them write and tell me how you and my Father are, and everything that is going on among you. Take care of yourselves, my dear Mother; this passes for a dangerous season of the year, and winter is coming with its colds and coughs.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I was much obliged by your kind and speedy reply about the Paper on Luther.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1831-09-09">9 Sept.</date> Napier&#x2019;s letter began: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Luther</hi> is an old, but a noble subject, and one which you are not in the least likely to suggest for an article in the Review, without being conscious that you have nothing new to say upon it. I shall, therefore, be happy to see your article; but, when I think of the magnitude of the subject, my very limited space of 16 sheets per N<hi rend="italic">o.</hi>, and the probability of your wishing to deliver yourself of your thoughts free from all restraints, I confess that I feel it to be necessary first of all to call your attention to the mechanical matter of dimension, in order that you may be able to tell me what portion of my 16 sheets you may be likely to require. My <hi rend="italic">necessities</hi>&#x2014;nothing else&#x2014;oblige me to say, that I should wish you to limit yourself to a couple of sheets, or at most, thirty five pages.&#x201D;</note> I can sympathise in your distresses, from author and from reader, in regard to the matter of length: both parties are somewhat unreasonable, and the Editor, who must stand in the middle and sustain two fires, has no sinecure of it. Indeed, I think it is a thousand pities that writing had ever in any case come to be valued by its <hi rend="italic">length:</hi> better even, if we must have a universal standard, that it were valued by its <hi rend="italic">shortness;</hi> for Prolixity, in word, and still more in thought, may be defined as the characteristic of all bad writing; not to know the Essential from the Unessential, is simply not to know the matter in hand, and therefore to delineate it falsely and ill. Poor Authors, with Booksellers for their Mecaenases!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gaius Cilnius Maecenas (<date>70?&#x2013;8 B.C.</date>), Roman statesman and patron of literature; friend of Emperor Augustus and of Horace and Vergil.</note> Nay the very Weaver does not come and say, Here are so many yards of Cloth I have woven; but, Here are so many yards of <hi rend="italic">such</hi> Cloth.</p>
<p>Six-and-thirty pages are a considerable space; yet I doubt whether so much would suffice me in this case. The thing I had in view was some picture of Martin Luther and of his Environment, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> he was, and <hi rend="italic">how</hi> he was; a matter, as you observe, of perennial moment; and requiring perhaps to be re-interpreted, and re-adapted to our new point of vision; of great interest for me therefore, but at the same time, of great compass and difficulty. At all events I think it will be prudent to wait a little and reconsider it before starting.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The subject of Luther was congenial to him, and it is regrettable that he never treated it at any length.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-13" n="06:13"/>Hope&#x2019;s Book <hi rend="italic">on Man</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Thomas Hope, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310911-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC <date when="1831-09-11">11 Sept.</date></ref> Napier had suggested Hope&#x2019;s book as a possible subject for a review article.</note> is also a subject I might have something to say upon; works of that sort are a characteristic of our era, and appear in great numbers: Godwin has published one (of little merit); Coleridge also has lately set forth a fragmentary Philosophy of Life; and I read a very strange one by Friedrich Schlegel,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Godwin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Thoughts on Man</hi> (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>); possibly Coleridge&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Aids to Reflection</hi> (<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>); Friedrich Schlegel&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Philosophische Vorlesungen</hi> (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>). See <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXVIII, 1.</note> which he died while completing. It struck me that by grouping two or three of these together, contrasting their several tendencies, and endeavouring, as is the Reviewer&#x2019;s task, to stand peaceably in the middle of them all, something fit and useful might be done. I sent accordingly to consult Mr Rees how the Books were to be got at: he readily furnished me with Godwin; but informed me that Hope was not to be had without great difficulty, that you had a Copy which he would send for, and directly forward me. My present request is that if the Book is not already here, or on its way, you would favour me with it by the first conveyance. It is in any case worth looking thro&#x2019; with more deliberation than my actual conveniences allow; Murray himself has not a Copy left, and I have only seen the Book, by special indulgence, in the British Museum. Whether it may be worth reviewing I am doubtful: it seems to be the work of a deep, earnest man, bears traces of long-continued, toilsome faithful meditation; and yet is perhaps the absurdest Book ever printed in any time or place. The highest culminating-point of the Mechanical Spirit of this age; as it were, the <foreign><hi rend="italic">reductio ad absurdum</hi></foreign> of that whole most melancholy Doctrine.</p>
<p>Another matter I had to speak of, by any convenient vehicle: the State of Authors at this epoch; the duties, performances, and marvellous position of the Author in our System of Society; matters which, as I believe, will one day force themselves on the universal attention. As yet however all this lies vague enough before me. You shall judge of it when the time comes.</p>
<p>On the whole, I think I can engage to have <hi rend="italic">something</hi> to offer you for your <date when="1831-12-00">December</date> Number; tho&#x2019; whether on Hope&#x2019;s Book, or in what other form, has not yet become clear to me. Will you, at all events, forward me that wondrous Book; we shall then see what comes of it.</p>
<p>As t<supplied>[he]</supplied> last piece of business, for the present, I may mention that the money for th<supplied>[e]</supplied> Article on Taylor can be best transacted for <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> and request you to fa<supplied>[vour]</supplied> me with the necessary document so soon <pb id="pg-06-14" n="06:14"/>as you have leisure. If it be a sizeab<supplied>[le]</supplied> letter, the Lord Advocate will frank it for me.</p>
<p>By <supplied>[the way]</supplied>, the poor Lord Advocate as you have doubtless heard, <supplied>[is]</supplied> very ill; pai<supplied>[nfully]</supplied>, not dangerously: we saw him last night, and found that <supplied>[he]</supplied> was understood to be recovering.</p>
<p>This is the day when, as the most seem to calculate, the Lords are to <hi rend="italic">reject</hi> the Reform Bill. London is perfectly quiet, and promises to continue so: the poor Lords can only accelerate (by perhaps a century) their own otherwise inevitable enough abolition; that is the worst they can do: the People and their purposes are no longer dependent on them.</p>
<p>Mrs Carlyle is here, and joins me in kind regards to you.</p>

<salute>My Dear Friend,</salute>
<p>My Leddy has been here for the last fortnight; and, were not the distance so great, would perhaps, in spite of ceremony, have been in Pimlico before this time. Could not you, who have long limbs and a true heart, walk hither, and save her the trouble? Come on Sunday afternoon: you will find us at Coffee, about six o&#x2019;clock; and delighted to see you.</p>
<p>If Mrs. Cunningham can walk with you, it will of course be a double and threefold pleasure: but otherwise, as the whole business is not worth coach hire, I am charged to say that her card will be accepted instead; and in due time repaid not in kind but by actual value. Come then, if you possibly can.</p>
<p>My MS. after various hitherings and thitherings lies quiet in its drawer; waiting for better days.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Had our Lord Advocate been in a franking condition of late, or even had I certainly known where you were, that the charge of a Post-letter might with any profit be inflicted on you, I should have written to tell you of our welfare and inquire after yours. As it is, you must be content with this late notice: I am uncertain still whether the poor Advocate (who is very sick) can be personally applied to for a frank: however, one way or another, I will try to get it done. There is a Letter for M&#x2019;Diarmid about our change of Address: he will put your Letter into the Post-office; and so I hope by your own or M&#x2019;Knight&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281230-JWC-TC-01"><sic>4:438</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1828-12-30">30 Dec. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> industry, this will get into your hands on Wednesday.</p>
<p>To get thro&#x2019; with what can be called business on this occasion, let me first discuss this barbarous Smith&#x2019;s Account<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blacksmith&#x2019;s, for work done at Craigenputtoch.</note> which you find inclosed here. What you are to do with it will presently (if your own recollection be good) reveal itself. Did you not <hi rend="italic">fully settle</hi> with the Smith, for yourself and for me, about a week before Martinmas last year? I remember the man&#x2019;s coming up (it was while our Father was there); I remember also paying you some money on his account (I think some &#xa3;2 or so); and perfectly understanding myself to be free <pb id="pg-06-16" n="06:16"/>of the whole concern when I first rode down with Harry after Bretton left us. Jane says, my things and yours were all paid in a lump, and she does not think <hi rend="italic">we</hi> ever got any receipt: but most probably (for I believe you keep such things) you may still have one. This is my very strong <hi rend="italic">presumption</hi> of the matter; and was, till I saw this strange Account, my quite clear <hi rend="italic">Conviction</hi>. So, I think it will still turn out to stand.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, consider whether it was not <hi rend="italic">till Whitsunday</hi> merely that you settled at last Martinmas? I imagine, it could hardly be so: for you remember we paid him some &#xa3;3 in the preceding spring,&#x2014;that horrid wet Wednesday you and I drove down to Dumfries together.</p>
<p>On the whole, dear Alick, this is all the light I can throw on the matter; and I must just request you to get at the bottom of it yourself, and see to get it settled; hoping it may be one of the last <foreign><hi rend="italic">burbles</hi></foreign> [troubles] we may ever have to unravel in that altogether <foreign><hi rend="italic">burbly</hi></foreign> Dunscore concern.&#x2014; I must also request you to pay the Dumfries Postmaster sixpence for me, and mark it against me: he I think it must have been that paid so much for a Letter which was forwarded hither; pray ask him and, and [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] settle with him. And now having done with business, I will talk or tattle with you to the end of the sheet.</p>
<p>You are already aware that Jane arrived safe here; that we have got into new Lodgings, which I may now mention are very quiet and comfortable. My health continues much what it used to be at Craigenputtoch, tolerable enough: the only real ground of complaint is, that I can yet get on with no work. My whole affairs are so scattered hither and thither, the whole environment is so strange: however, I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> gird myself up resolutely, and begin &#x201C;<foreign>new bode new play</foreign>.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently &#x201C;a new offer a new response.&#x201D;</note> I have two or three Essays on the anvil for Napier&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Review;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be thro&#x2019; them one way or another. My poor <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>, as you have perhaps heard, cannot be printed at present; for this plain reason, all Bookselling is <hi rend="italic">at an end</hi>, till once this Reform Bill of theirs be passed. So, after duly vexatious trial, I have locked up my Manuscript here beside me; and mean to let it lie at least till next month before making any farther attempt. So influential even on me are the follies of the noodle Legislators, with their prorogations and their stuff,&#x2014;all which, it is to be hoped, will one day find their true place and value.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-17" n="06:17"/>Meanwhile we have plenty of people to see and study: the Montagues, the Irvings, Badamses, Jeffreys; as well as sundry new acquaintances, the number of which must considerably enlarge as the Town gets peopled again in <date when="1831-11-00">November</date>. A few evenings ago, I saw a Brother of Gustave&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adolphe d&#x2019;Eichthal.</note> the French Saint Simonian: a very intelligent youth, no Saint Simonian, but a general seeker after Light; whom I forwarded with some introductions to Edinburgh, whither he was bound, with purpose to see us more at large when he returned. There a<supplied>[re]</supplied> various profitable persons here, of whom I shall tell you more, when I have seen into them better.&#x2014; Of place or promotion, I think, there is little chance for me in London, or anywhere: however, I am still disposed to believe that I ought to lift up my voice among this benighted multitude, in the way of lecturing or otherwise; and may very probably do it, if no better may be, had I ascertained the ground a little better.&#x2014; A Letter has come this moment inviting me to dine next week with the Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fonblanque.</note> whom I am rather ambitious to know. I will tell you about him, if he be worth telling about.</p>
<p>Jack went off on Tuesday gone a week, in rather high spirits; wrote me from Dover that he had met his Countess, found all right, and was to sail on Thursday Morning: he would get to Paris about Saturday Night last; so that I shall look for a Letter from him some time next week: he calculated on continuing there for a fortnight or better; I introduced him to the St. Simonians, and otherwise he would have enough to busy himself with. <hi rend="italic">Thrift</hi> and fearless rigorous <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi>, these were the two precepts I strove to inculcate on him: the latter he had already got pretty well (which so few do) into the way of practicing. We all augur good from his journey, and think it will be the beginning of permanent benefit to him. As a man he is much improved since he left home; and wants little to make him, as I imagine, a most promising Physician. A handsome middle-sized family Bible, a present for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, he left with us; having long kept it for an opportunity: it now graces our mantel-piece; we shall study to take care of it.</p>
<p>Touching Politics I will not trouble you with a word. All is quiet here, but full of apprehension. If they do not get along <hi rend="italic">quickly</hi> (which may be doubted) with their new creation of Peers,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The opposition of the House of Lords to the Reform Bill (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311006-TCJWC-MAC-01"><sic>JWC and TC</sic><corr>TCJWC</corr> to MAC, <date when="1831-10-06">6 Oct.</date></ref>) caused the question of the creation of sufficient new peers to pass the bill to be raised. William IV was against this, but after the introduction of the third reform bill to the House of Commons in <date when="1831-12-00">December</date>, he reluctantly agreed to the creation of about a dozen new peers if it became necessary. Eventually it proved not to be.</note> there will be <pb id="pg-06-18" n="06:18"/>tumult in the land; but perhaps not here <hi rend="italic">first</hi>. It is said there is to be a Convention of Reform Delegates congregated here ere long: if it seem needful, very probably I think there may.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, p. 206, Carlyle also says that he heard &#x201C;talk of a &#x2018;Convention of Delegates&#x2019; about to assemble from all the four winds. &#x2026; Some noises in the streets last night; but as yet no reports of rioting.&#x201D; The &#x201C;Convention&#x201D; met later in the month to discuss the formation of a National Political Union &#x201C;for the promotion of the great measure of reform.&#x201D; Sir Francis Burdett, Hume, Thelwall, Detrosier, and William Lovett the Chartist spoke from the platform. The demand was made for full manhood suffrage and &#x201C;reform or revolution.&#x201D; See the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1831-11-01">1 Nov.</date></note> Poor country! Millions in it nigh starving; and for help of them, Talk, Talk, and nothing but Talk!</p>
<p>Now, however, I nestle down out of infinite Space, into one little corner there of; and try to picture for myself some image of your being at the solitary Craig. I hope you and Jenny and your little Jane Welsh<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Welsh Carlyle (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), eldest child of Alexander and Janet, who later married Robert Simms.</note> are all thriving there; and doing whatsoever you feel to be worthy and best, wh<supplied>[ich]</supplied> is the only true blessedness. O my dear Brother, keep a watch <supplied>[on your]</supplied> footsteps: man walks on the very brink of unfathomable abysses always; if he swerve but a little to the right hand or left, he sinks and is swallowed forever! The good God has hitherto preserved us all in some measure: let us while we live front the world as <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> men and as <hi rend="italic">wise</hi>, be the rest how it may.</p>

<salute>My Dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I have this moment been favoured with your kind Message and Inquiry.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> That business of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>, well meant as it was, has turned out, I find, as &#x201C;the best concerted schemes of mice and men&#x201D; often do: instead of quieting your friendly anxieties, it has stirred them up into new fermentation. The Newspaper in question was purchased by my Brother, in the Regent-Circus, Piccadilly, on the very edge of his departure for France, as the coach stood waiting; and by him transmitted hither as a symbol of his safe arrival at Dover; whereupon I (not he, for it was my hand) forwarded it to Glasgow, hoping that it might pleasantly remind you of my existence, and perhaps convey (mutely but gratuitously) all the information that in the present state of matters could be given, which fair project having, as we perceive, &#x201C;gone <foreign>aglee</foreign>,&#x201D; there is this good in it, that I receive a <pb id="pg-06-20" n="06:20"/>new assurance of your kind regard, and am specifically called on to return you the like. Let us be thankful for all friendly thought.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The postmarks on the newspaper sent by Carlyle to Graham seem to have alarmed him; hence Carlyle&#x2019;s explanation of how they got there. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311021-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-10-21">21 Oct.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>Jack went off, at the time indicated, in good spirits; well wrapt up, and looking forward to a more glittering future. He has since written me a short note from the sea coast; that he had met his Countess, that they were to be at Paris in some four days, that he was well, and all looking well. From the French Vanity Fair I as yet hear nothing, tho&#x2019; he must have been there rather more than a week: I expect some tidings almost daily. To you also, from some point of his route or residence, I imagine some friendly memorial will arrive.</p>
<p>For both your letters, to him and to me, were duly delivered and duly welcomed, and read in common with the pleasure that belongs to quite undoubted testimonials of affection. Unhappily but a rare pleasure; yet sometimes, as we see, imparted to us even in this Devil&#x2019;s Epoch. We ought to be the gladder of them.&#x2014; I rejoice heartily to learn that you have an actual profitable employment; and so fair a prospect of a better one, in the American Consulship; which I wish it lay with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to secure for you. May the hard heart of Jonathan<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning North American, especially New Englanders, from &#x201C;Brother Jonathan,&#x201D; the name given to Jonathan Trumbull, Governor of Connecticut, by George Washington.</note> be turned in the right direction! I think he may go farther and not find a fitter man. It further gives me real satisfaction to find that you have now well nigh done with Burnswark. The feeling that attached you to that &#x201C;spot of clay&#x201D; was a praiseworthy, even venerable one: nevertheless it has many times grieved me to figure a man of your talents and attainments spending them on so ungainly a field; why, Hab or Meinfoot could farm Burnswark better than Cincinnatus; and <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;understand the Commerce of the World! My advice were that you shook yourself loose of Burnswark, the sooner the better. Neither is this a shaking yourself loose from Dumfriesshire: the Mould of Dumfriesshire, nay these very Limbs we have made from it, are not <hi rend="italic">ours</hi>, we have but a <hi rend="italic">Life-rent of them:</hi> all that was true Property, in our possessions there, the love of soul to soul, and the good soul does to soul, remains to us forever.&#x2014; I shall hold it a real benefit, whether this Consulship be awarded you or not, to know you once more with &#x201C;your foot on the fog&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310826-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1831-08-26">26 Aug.</date></ref></note> the &#x201C;world before you where to choose&#x201D;:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, XII, 646.</note> for I am <pb id="pg-06-21" n="06:21"/>convinced, such gifts and qualities as yours must even in these times find some reasonable market. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Esperance! Esperance!</hi></foreign></p>
<p>I keep your Memorial on Patents laid safely by, and consider myself bound to bring it before the proper person when the proper time comes. I could leave it with the Advocate<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey.</note> any day, but it would inevitably be thrown by, and lost in chaos. The Advocate is sick, and confined to bed: moreover, sick or well, there has no thing, public or private so much as a chance to be considered till once this unspeakably wearisome Reform Bill be passed. All men&#x2019;s anxieties, thoughts, calculations are directed thither and thither alone. By the mysterious arrangement of this world, it has been ordered that 200 bipeds, few of them with sense of stuff enough to make a moderate taylor, should be called <hi rend="italic">Peers</hi>, and have the power to keep all Britain in a ferment for months, perhaps to drive it into desperation, and anarchy: But at the same time, as old Smail the Ecclefechan Smith said: &#x201C;How can you help it? we must just do the best we can for a livelihood, Boy.&#x201D;&#x2014; For the present all is quietness and good humour here: Songs singing on the streets, etc. etc. etc: the &#x201C;Hundred and Ninety-nine&#x201D;;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly songs about the number of new peers needed to carry the Reform Bill.</note> nay what will perhaps astonish you, our new alarm is of a &#x201C;rising in Glasgow&#x201D;! Few would believe me, till the event showed, that Saunders<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> knew infinitely better how many beans made five than to &#x201C;rise,&#x201D; and have his crown broken, on any such occasion.</p>
<p>To me also this state of matters brings its evils. No Bookseller will so much as look at a Manuscript for the last five months; all trade in Books is utterly asleep. So after laboriously enough ascertaining this, I have locked up my poor Bundle of Papers, and do not mean to speak about them, for some weeks; not at all, if times do not alter,&#x2014;which however, they must do, or altogether cease and determine. Meanwhile I have brought my <hi rend="italic">Leddy</hi> up hither; she is now sitting sewing beside me, and sends you her truest regards. We have a pretty little quiet and cleanly first-floor, where, now that I have a Housewife again, all goes comfortably enough: here, seeing and being seen, we purpose to pass the winter; and shall hope to revisit old scenes and old friends in spring,&#x2014;with perhaps better knowledge how the world actually whirls, and keener relish for the quiet nooks therein. I have met and am to meet with sundry strange men; of whom more at our meeting. Allan Cunningham, whom I see, remembers you kindly. Irving lives <pb id="pg-06-22" n="06:22"/>far nearer me; and I believe is near me in heart as well as place; yet the good man is strangely beleaguered with Shadows and Substances; preaching, teaching, working miracles, and what not; and I fear partly seems to &#x201C;<foreign>scunner</foreign>&#x201D; at [flinch from] communicating freely with one so heterodox as me. I purpose yet to tell him my whole mind about that <hi rend="italic">miraculous</hi> rubbish of his one day: He <hi rend="italic">deserves</hi> such a mark of confidence from me; and I love him as one of the best men and best friends I was ever brought near.&#x2014; But the paper is done; and my too soft Pen has been unthrifty. Pray write to me again, whenever you have leisure; when aught notable befals whether you have leisure or not. Also do not <hi rend="italic">frank</hi> your letters, or I must do the like.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle implies that if Graham uses a frank, and so saves him from paying for his letter on delivery, he will feel that he must return the compliment and do the same.</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I got that Paris Letter of John&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated at Hotel de Bristol, Place Vend&#xF4;me, <date when="1831-10-13">13 Oct.</date></note> two days ago; and now mean to write you another which may go along with it; and wrap the whole in a Frank, so that you may find them all waiting ready when you call for the Newspaper. The Advocate is not much better yet, and in no case for franking: however, I will leave the Letter with him today, and either he or some other will do it.</p>
<p>Last Monday I wrote to Alick; counting that he would be at Craigenputtoch, and get the message on Wednesday. I still send <hi rend="italic">you</hi> both the Newspapers; for I know not how to arrange it: in any case, I calculate that you will duly forward at least the London one to him every Wednesday. I strongly called upon him to write, and settle that and various more important matters: but who knows when he or any of them will give ear to me? I must just guess, and pray and hope the best.</p>
<p>You will see by John&#x2019;s Letter that everything is going on well with <pb id="pg-06-23" n="06:23"/>him: a pleasant scene, pleasant weather and companions; and what is best of all, some feeling that he is fit for his office, and may perform it with profit and acceptance. Let us continue to trust that his steps may be guided towards Good; that he may return safe and wiser, and be a blessing to himself and others.</p>
<p>As for us we have nestled down here in our tight little Lodging, and are as quiet as we could wish to be. Jane is in better health than she has enjoyed for many months; I too am fully better: we live thriftily; have companions and conversation of the best that can be had; and, except that I hitherto cannot honestly tell myself that I am <hi rend="italic">working</hi> (tho&#x2019; I daily make the attempt to work, and keep <foreign><hi rend="italic">scraffling</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">feltering</hi></foreign> [struggling and making poor progress]), we ought to call ourselves very well off indeed. The people of the house are cleanly, orderly, and seem honest: no noises, no bugs disturb one thro&#x2019; the night: on the whole it is among the best places for <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> I have been in; as you may judge by this fact, that more than once we have slept almost ten hours at a stretch: a noble spell of sleeping; of which however both of us, so long disturbed and tossed about, had need enough. The worst thing about our establishment is its <hi rend="italic">hamperedness</hi>, which is so much the more sensible to us coming from the desart vastness of the moor at Craigenputtoch: I have a sort of feeling as if I were tied up in a <hi rend="italic">sack</hi>, and could not get my fins stirred. No doubt this will wear off: for one needs but little room to work profitably in; <hi rend="italic">my</hi> craft especially requires nothing but a chair, a table, and a piece of paper. Were I once fairly <hi rend="italic">heated</hi> at my work, I shall not mind what sort of harness I am in. Napier writes to me that he expects a &#x201C;striking Essay&#x201D; from my hand for his next <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Napier&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1831-10-15">15 Oct.</date></note> so I must bestir me; for there is little more than a month to work on.</p>
<p>Some of my friends here are talking of possible situations for me: but as yet on no ground that I can fairly see with my own eyes. I let it be known to every one who takes interest in me that I am very desirous to work at <hi rend="italic">any</hi> honest employment I am acquainted with; but for the rest, able to hold on my way whether I find other employment or not. If I can earn myself a more liberal livelihood, I hope I shall be thankful for it, and use it as beseems me; nay I would even live in London for the sake of such a blessing: but if nothing of the kind turn up, as is most likely, then I can also, with all contentment, return to the whinstone Craig, and rejoice that this city of refuge is left me. Truly thankful ought I to be that the Giver of all Good has imparted <pb id="pg-06-24" n="06:24"/>to me this highest of all blessings: Light to discern His hand in the confused workings of this evil world; and to follow fearlessly whithersoever He beckons! Ever praised be God for it! I was once the miserablest of all men, but shall not be so any more.&#x2014; On the whole, however, there is work in abundance for me here: men ignorant on all hands of me of what it most concerns them to know; neither will I turn me from the task of teaching them, as it is given me. Had I once investigated the ground fully, I may perhaps lift up my voice, so that it shall be heard a little farther than heretofore. But I wish to do nothing rashly; to take no step which I might wish in vain to retrace.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my Book, withdrawn from all Bookselling consultations, lies safe in the Box; waiting till the Book trade revive before I make any farther attempt. The <hi rend="italic">Reform Bill</hi>, I suppose, must be disposed of first; and when that may be I know not, neither indeed care. If the world will not have my bit Book, then of a truth my bit Book can do without the world<supplied>[.]</supplied> One good thing in the middle of all this stagnation is that we are perfectly peacable here, tho&#x2019; the contrary was by some apprehended. The Newspapers will tell you, as their way is, about wars and rumours of war; but you need not believe them, or heed them: I see no symptom of revolting among the people; neither do I believe that anything short of Hunger will raise them; of which happily there is as yet no approach. So keep yourself perfectly easy, my Dear Mother; and know that we are as safe as we could anywhere be; nay at the first stir of &#x201C;revolution,&#x201D; cannot we hasten to the <hi rend="italic">Craig</hi>, and sit there, and see them revolve it out for their own behoof!</p>
<p>I daresay you have not yet seen in the newspapers, but will soon see something extraordinary about poor Edward Irving.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> (<date when="1831-10-19">19 Oct.</date>) reports &#x201C;Disturbance at the National Scotch Church&#x201D; at both the morning and evening services: &#x201C;A great part of the congregation standing upon the seats, to ascertain the cause of alarm, while the rev. gentleman, standing with arms extended, and occasionally beckoning them to silence, formed a scene which perhaps partook as much of the ridiculous as of the sublime.&#x201D;</note> His friends here are all much grieved about him. For many months, he has been puddling and muddling in the midst of certain insane jargoning of hysterical women, and crackbrained enthusiasts, who start up from time to time in public companies, and utter confused Stuff, mostly &#x201C;Ohs&#x201D; and &#x201C;Ahs&#x201D; and absurd interjections about &#x201C;the Body of Jesus&#x201D;; they also pretend to &#x201C;work miracles,&#x201D; and have raised more than one weak bedrid woman, and cured people of &#x201C;Nerves,&#x201D; or as they themselves say, &#x201C;cast Devils out of them.&#x201D; All which poor Irving is pleased to consider as the &#x201C;work of the Spirit&#x201D;; and to <foreign><hi rend="italic">janner</hi></foreign> [talk foolishly] <pb id="pg-06-25" n="06:25"/>about at great length, as making <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Church the peculiarly blessed of Heaven, and equal to or greater than the primitive one at Corinth! This, greatly to my sorrow, and that of many, has gone on privately for a good while, with increasing vigour: but last Sabbath, it burst out publickly in the open Church; for one of the &#x201C;Prophetesses&#x201D; (a woman on the verge of derangement) started up in the time of worship, and began to &#x201C;speak with tongues&#x201D;; and as the thing was encouraged by Irving, there were some three or four fresh hands who started up in the evening sermon, and began their ragings; whereupon the whole congregation got into foul uproar, some groaning, some laughing, some shrieking, not a few falling into swoons: more like a Bedlam than a Christian Church. Happily neither Jane or I were there; tho&#x2019; we had been the previous day. We had not even heard of it, when going next evening to call on Irving, we found the house all decked out for a &#x201C;meeting&#x201D; (that is, a bout at this same &#x201C;speaking with tongues&#x201D;); and as we talked a moment with Irving who had come down to us, there rose a shriek in the upper story of the house, and presently he exclaimed: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">There</hi> is one prophecying; come and hear her!&#x201D; we hesitated to go, but he forced us up into a back-room, and there we could hear the wretched creature raving like one possessed; <hi rend="italic">hoo</hi>ing and <hi rend="italic">ha</hi>-ing, and talking <hi rend="italic">as</hi> sensibly as one would do with a pint of brandy in his stomach: till after some ten minutes she seemed to grow tired, and became silent. Nothing so shocking and altogether unspeakably deplorable was it ever my lot to hear. Poor Jane was on the verge of fainting; and did not recover the whole night.&#x2014; And now the Newspapers have got wind of it, and are groaning loudly over it; and the Congregation itself is like to split on the matter; and for poor Irving in any case dark mad times seem coming. You need not speak of all this, at least not be the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> to speak of it: most likely, it will soon be too public. What the final issue for our most worthy but most misguided Friend may be, I dare not so much as guess. Could I do anything to save him, it were well my part; but I despair of being able to accomplish anything. I began a Letter to him yesterday, but gave it up again as hopeless, when I heard that the Newspapers had interfered; for now, Irving I reckon will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> draw back, lest it should seem fear of men rather than of God. The unhappy man! Let us nevertheless hope that he is not utterly lost, but only gone astray for a time. Be thankful also that our wits are still in some measure left with us.</p>
<p>I must now, my Dear Mother, close my scribbling for another time. It is needless to say how ardently I desire and long to have some <pb id="pg-06-26" n="06:26"/>tidings from you in return. Alas! no Carrier comes hither; we cannot even try to hear of you here on Wednesdays. How are you all? How is my dear Father, whom I meant to have written by this opportunity, but doubt if I shall now find time? How are <supplied>[yo]</supplied>u, and all the &#x201C;little ones&#x201D; now grown large? Take all great care of yourselves; take all great care of one another: be all well and good in the Spring, when we find you again! &#x201C;Little Jean,&#x201D; I know will stand true in the writing way; Jamie also promised solemnly; let him also think of proving himself a true man. Take a large <hi rend="italic">long</hi> sheet, fill it full among you, and off with it! No matter how <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> it be written they will bring it here for the matter of a shilling, and we shall read it with avidity.&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are to go visit the Badamses on thursday next, and stay for a day or two: this afternoon I am engaged to dine with the Editor of the Examiner;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fonblanque.</note> in the course of next month our old friends will all have returned; Mrs Strachey<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Strachey had written on <date when="1831-10-10">10 Oct.</date> from Newton Abbott, Devonshire, where she was staying with her sister Lady Louis, to express her pleasure in the prospect of soon meeting Jane Carlyle. But she expressed fears concerning the development of liberal political and religious views in her nephew Charles Buller. She was conservative politically and a member of the Evangelical Clapham Sect to which Hannah More, the Babingtons, the Macaulays, the Wilberforces, and Arthur Young also belonged. Her comments show how extreme Charles Buller seemed, even to members of his own family: &#x201C;From what I can gather of his sentiments &#x26; those of his party, they do not wish for Reform&#x2014;but Revolution&#x2014;&#x26; devise a complete upset of all existing things, in order, that in the general confusion <hi rend="italic">they individually,</hi> may become exalted to the rank, which they conceive they are entitled to fill. &#x2026;&#x201D; If there is to be a revolution, she believes that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">amongst the atheists will be found those</hi> who will be the cold blooded tyrants of their brethren. &#x2026; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am <hi rend="italic">zealous</hi> for reform.&#x201D; She hopes that Carlyle will influence Charles to adopt &#x201C;juster &#x26; purer principles of action.&#x201D;</note> among the number.&#x2014; But now, dear Mother, good day again! We think of you daily I might almost say always: nay morning and evening, the Scotsbrig Butter (which Jane stamps into nice Savoury <hi rend="italic">prints</hi>) of itself would force us to remember you. May God&#x2019;s blessing be in and upon you all! <closer><salute>Your affectionate Son,</salute></closer></p>

[Added on <date when="1831-10-14">14 Oct.</date>:] At the dinner he had met M. Michel Chevalier (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>), &#x201C;one of the editors of the Globe.&#x201D; He had attended a meeting of the Saint-Simonians with d&#x2019;Eichthal: &#x201C;It was impossible to make oneself heard without screaming quite violently. The men were dressed in blue coats lighter in colour according to their higher rank, &#x26; most of the women in white or printed cotton except Claire Bazard &#x26; Madame Roderiguez who had also blue gowns. A stranger admitted amongst them without knowing any thing of their sentiments might have been long in guessing their purpose. Eichthal introduced me to Bazard [Saint-Amand Bazard (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), French socialist and Saint-Simonian]. &#x2026; There was nothing peculiar in the appearance of M. Bazard, nothing in his countenance or manner to indicate peculiar dignity or meanness. &#x2026; M. Enfantin [Barth&#xE9;lemy Prosper Enfantin (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), leader of the Saint-Simonians] has long hair &#x26; stoops, is rather a solemn &#x26; as it seemed dubious personage. Eichthal is a kind of enthusiast &#x26; really has the cause at heart. He looks a little sad &#x26; speaks of the violence of their enemies at the same time that he mentions their extending connexions. I am told that their present strength &#x26; influence in Paris is less than it was a few months after the Revolution, &#x26; that the novelty &#x26; boldness of their speculations &#x26; terminology have lost much of their interest. &#x2026; I may mention that Eichthal told me he thought John Mill a sort of dilettante, without heart to speak out his convictions. His incapability of laughing is the most suspicious circumstance about him, &#x26; if Eichthal&#x2019;s representation be true it must be another confirmation of Teufelsdreck&#x2019;s theory.&#x201D;</note> eagerly expected, came to hand last Tuesday, and I now by the next Post, despatch you an answer. The <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> gave notice of your arrival at Dover; more explicitly your two Notes, which a benevolent &#x201C;Twopenny&#x201D; delivered next day. I directly after wrote to our Mother; conveying these tidings; and promising that your Letter from Paris should be forwarded the instant it arrived. Which promise I have now fulfilled; for yesterday I wrapped up both your Letter and your Note with a very long Letter from myself under the same cover, and carried them over to the Advocate&#x2019;s to be franked; when doubtless they will be despatched today, and so reach Scotsbrig along with the Courier on Sunday. Greatly to the joy of all, I dare prophecy. For the rest, however, I can <pb id="pg-06-28" n="06:28"/>give you no news of those dear friends; not the smallest &#x201C;scrape of a pen&#x201D; having arrived here yet, tho&#x2019; I wrote to Alick, earnestly inviting him also to be a correspondent. From which I infer so much, that nothing sinister has happened, but all things are going their old course.</p>
<p>As for ourselves, we have nothing but moderately tolerable news to tell you. Our Lodgings fulfil all reasonable expectation: cleanly, reputable, honest people; the houseroom limited enough, but comfortable; and above all adapted for <hi rend="italic">sleeping in</hi> to a degree hitherto unexampled. We are well nigh as quiet, and altogether as free from bed-<hi rend="italic">neighbours</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bugs.</note> as at Puttoch itself; and accordingly have oftener than once accomplished the wonderful feat of sleeping ten hours in a piece! Jane celebrates her improving appetite, drives all headaches to flight by your Henbane (which also she has happily seldom need of), and on the whole seems to be healthier and happier: I too am said to be improving in looks, and perhaps am really better in health; tho&#x2019; as yet except my renewed talent for sleep, I grieve to say that there is small fruit therefrom. Napier writes that he &#x201C;trusts to me for a striking Paper in the <date when="1831-12-00">December</date> No.&#x201D;&#x2014;and yesterday I was at length favoured with a copy of <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi> from the Longmans: so that certainly I must at length bestir myself; but how or on what subject I shall write has nowise become clear to me. <hi rend="italic">Scribbling</hi> (Notes upon M&#xfc;llner<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311006-TCJWC-MAC-01"><sic>JWC and TC</sic><corr>TCJWC</corr> to MAC, [<date when="1831-10-06">6 Oct.</date>]</ref>. In <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi> (pp. 211&#x2013;12) Carlyle writes about this time: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">M&#xfc;llner</hi> is not written or perhaps worth writing; however the rude materials of it are on paper, and lie tied up with packthread, abiding their time.&#x201D; Carlyle&#x2019;s notebooks also mention the possibility of a course of lectures, of which &#x201C;the subject should be &#x2018;Things in general&#x2019; (under some more dignified title).&#x201D;</note> &#x26;c) is what I have practiced every day since you left us; but hitherto am quite out of sorts for <hi rend="italic">writing;</hi> all hampered and hemmed in, not in the least at home. I know the disease of old, and know also the remedy. Doubtless, if I stay here, there is much to be <hi rend="italic">done:</hi> I am even seriously turning over the scheme of <hi rend="italic">lecturing;</hi> and think I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> do it and with profit were my <hi rend="italic">lips once unsealed</hi>. The gross groping ignorance in which I descry many, almost all, seems to invite and demand me. We shall look at the arena first, and then measure ourselves with it.&#x2014; As to <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck</hi> I may conclude this first section of his history in few words. Murray, on my renewed demand some days after your departure, forwarded me the <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi> with a polite enough note, and a &#x201C;Criticism&#x201D; from some altogether immortal &#x201C;Master of German Literature,&#x201D; to me quite unknown; which Criticism (a miserable, <pb id="pg-06-29" n="06:29"/>Dandiacal, <foreign><hi rend="italic">quodlibet</hi></foreign> [any thing whatever], in the usual vein) did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> authorize the Publication in these times. Whereupon, inspecting the Paper to ascertain that it was all there, we (my good Lady and I) wrapped all up, and laid it by under lock and key, to wait patiently for better times, or if so were ordered, to the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of times: and then despatching a very cordial-looking note to Murray, wound up the whole matter, not without composure of soul. Now that the Reform Bill is all to begin again, it may for aught I know be months before the Trade experience any revival; thus <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi> may perhaps be considered as postponed <foreign><hi rend="italic">sine die</hi></foreign> [for an indefinite period]: with which result also I am perfectly contented. What I have written I have written: the reading of it is another party&#x2019;s concern.&#x2014; In the economical point of view, I know not whether this other small occurrence be worth mentioning: that Montague (whom we see sometimes quite overflowing with &#x201C;blessings&#x201D;) kept rather annoying me with urgencies that I would &#x201C;apply to the Lord Advocate for the Registratorship in one of the six new Bankruptcy Courts&#x201D;; whereupon at last I did transmit one of the noble Lady&#x2019;s Notes on that subject to his Advocateship, and farther formally called upon Montague to testify by Letter (if his conscience permitted) that I was fitted for the station. Since which time I have at least been rid of the Montague importunities (for the matter has never once been hinted at); Jeffrey engaged to speak of it, but seemed to think with myself that there was hardly any hope in it; and so there it rests, in all human probability nothing more than a miserable &#x201C;chimera,&#x201D;&#x2014;with which, however, as I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> all that depended on myself, and did indeed care very little for success in it, I give myself no manner of uneasiness.</p>
<p>It will behove me, however, to get out of my own little doghutch with its interests, and tell you a little how the world is getting along. Of our Politics I will say nothing: the Parliament is prorouged [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] yesterday for a month, some say it will be for longer; the people are all at peace with their hands, and cackling like true Roman geese<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The geese who woke the defending Romans on the Capitoline Hill when it was attacked (<date>390 B.C.</date>).</note> with their tongues: so that it is wholly a weariness to turn oneself even for moments in that direction. Of more private news I will tell you somewhat: it is strange how that sort of things accumulates even in a week or two. Poor Dickenson<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Dickenson, whose obituary Carlyle appears to have read in the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> (<date when="1831-10-01">1 Oct.</date>). He was a medical student who was of exceptional promise and deeply regretted: &#x201C;His <hi rend="italic">Surgical</hi> attainments were of a high order,&#x201D; and he is said to have been &#x201C;as much endeared by his engaging manners, amiable disposition, and active benevolence, as he was respected for his superior scientific acquirements.&#x201D; He was buried at Haddington.</note> was well known to you: he died in the <pb id="pg-06-30" n="06:30"/>end of last month in the Edinburgh Infirmary (where he laboured as House-Surgeon) of typhus fever, caught in the discharge of his Hospital duty. We have mourned much over him; it was a real shock to us, above most others: so innocent worthy a man, so tragically marred in all that he had aimed at, &#x26; cut off when in sight of the goal. Wondrous are the ways of Nature, inscrutable to our little sense.&#x2014; The Advocate still complains bitterly, and I think does not mean to move from London; his general health he calls good, but plagues himself about the disease being cancerous and what not: he suffers great pain, but can now take an airing in the Park; the other night I had my longest conversation with him; about Literature &#x26;c &#x26;c, and have not seen him since, nor presented your remembrances to him.&#x2014; Learn also that Brougham has made six &#x201C;Knights of the Guelphic Order&#x201D;: Ivory, Babbage, Herschel (Mathematicians), Charles Bell (Surgeon), Dr. Brewster, and&#x2014;Professor John Leslie.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Those that Carlyle says were knighted were: James Ivory (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), mathematician, former professor at the Royal Military College; Charles Babbage (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>), mathematician, professor at Cambridge, inventor of a calculating machine; John Frederick William Herschel (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>), astronomer; Charles Bell (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), surgeon; for Dr. David Brewster (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>), see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190223-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:168</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1819-02-23">23 Feb. 1819</date></corr></ref>; and for John Leslie (<date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18160715-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:78</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1816-07-15">15 July 1816</date></corr></ref>. This was evidently told Carlyle by Jeffrey. In fact, Babbage was never knighted, and of the rest Bell and Herschel had been knighted on <date when="1831-10-12">12 Oct.</date>, the others later, all possibly in connection with their work for the foundation of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>. The &#x201C;Guelphic Order&#x201D; had previously been founded (in <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>) as a military order.</note> Quack, quack, quack!&#x2014; The Badamses inquire after you with the air of true friends: B. is often in Town, about his Mint Business, which seems to make little progress; his own health and wellbeing I should reckon progressive: we have appointed to go out and see them next Thursday.&#x2014; The Montagues come much about us, and have not improved and have not sunk in my estimation since you departed. Mill also has been here: he came once&#x2014;with whom think you? With Monsieur Adolphe d&#x2019;Eichthal; the same individual that sent his Recipe to Dr Irving&#x2019;s, and was living in Woburn Place. Adolphe is a brisk little Jewish looking figure, very ingenious and ingenuous: he seemed to take considerably to me; is now off to Edinburgh with Introductions from me to Moir, Sir W. Hamilton, and Wilson, whom I warned him to expect little of. He is no St Simonian, and I guess will hardly ever be, if your account prove prophetic. Poor St Simonians, with their <foreign><hi rend="italic">Deh</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-06-31" n="06:31"/><foreign><hi rend="italic">tanti palpitis,</hi></foreign> and red plush holes in the wall!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had said in his letter: &#x201C;Claire Bazard or Mad<hi rend="italic">e</hi> Roderiguez &#x2026; sung <foreign><hi rend="italic">Di tanti palpiti</hi></foreign> in a rough masculine style.&#x201D; Cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250411-JBW-EA-01"><sic>3:314</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1825-04-11">11 April 1825</date></corr></ref>. John had also described the rooms where the Saint-Simonians met as &#x201C;holes in the walls square shaped, lined with red silk cushions.&#x201D;</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Bitte dich fern zu halten</hi></foreign> [Please hold yourself aloof from it].<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle repeats the advice given to him by Goethe in his letter of <date when="1830-10-17">17 Oct. 1830</date>.</note> Adolphe is to see us when he returns: the melancholy news of his Uncle he had already with much affection confirmed to us. Of Mill I incline to augur better than Gustave does: I think he is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a Dilettante, but a smallish Enthusiast with the worst pabulum for such a temper; not without human vanity, but also not without reverence for what is above him. He and I were, last night, for the first time, at Fonblanque&#x2019;s; dining there.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill&#x2019;s estimate of Carlyle at this time is given in a letter of <date when="1831-10-20">20</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-10-22">22 Oct.</date> to John Sterling (Mineka, XII, 85&#x2013;86), whom Carlyle would not meet until <date when="1835-02-00">Feb. 1835</date>: &#x201C;Another acquaintance which I have recently made is that of Mr. Carlyle, whom I believe you are also acquainted with. I have long had a very keen relish for his articles in the Edinburgh &#x26; Foreign Reviews, which I formerly thought to be such consummate nonsense; and I think he improves upon a nearer acquaintance. He does not seem to me so entirely the reflexion or shadow of the great German writers as I was inclined to consider him; although undoubtedly his mind has derived from their inspiration whatever breath of life is in it. He seems to me as a man who has had his eyes unsealed, and who now looks round him &#x26; sees the aspects of things with his own eyes, but by the light supplied by others; not the pure light of day, but another light compounded of the same simple rays but in different proportions. He has by far the largest &#x26; widest liberality &#x26; tolerance (not in the sense which Coleridge justly disavows, but in the good sense) that I have met with in any one; &#x26; he differs from most men who see as much as he does into the defects of the age, by a circumstance greatly to his advantage in my estimation, that he looks for a safe landing <hi rend="italic">before</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">behind:</hi> he sees that if we could replace things as they once were, we should only retard the final issue, as we should in all human probability go on just as we then did, &#x26; arrive again at the very place where we now stand. Carlyle intends staying in town all the winter: he has brought his wife to town (whom I have not seen enough of yet to be able to judge of her at all): his object was to treat with booksellers about a work which he wishes to publish, but he has given up this for the present, finding that no bookseller will publish anything but a political pamphlet in the present state of excitement. In fact literature is suspended; men neither read nor write. Accordingly Carlyle means to employ his stay here in improving his knowledge of what is going on in the world, at least in this part of it, I mean in that part of the world of ideas and feelings which corresponds to London. He is a great hunter-out of acquaintances; he hunted me out, or rather hunted out the author of certain papers in the Examiner (the first, as he said, which he had ever seen in a newspaper, hinting that the age was not the best of all possible ages): &#x26; his acquaintance is the only substantial good I have yet derived from writing those papers, &#x26; a much greater one than I expected when I wrote them. He has also, through me, sought the acquaintance of Fonblanque (of the Examiner) whom I found him to be an admirer of, and who though as little of a mystic as most men, reads his writing with pleasure.&#x201D;</note> F<supplied>[onblanque]</supplied>. lives far away in the Edgeware Road; and is still lame with
 <pb id="pg-06-32" n="06:32"/>his Gig-fall. He has a delightful <hi rend="italic">Housekin</hi>, with offices &#x26;c, and a &#x201C;beautiful ideal&#x201D; to wife. He himself standing on crutches, all braced round with straps (of what seemed cloth-listing) received me very handsomely: a long, thin, flail of a man, with wintry zealous looking eyes; lank, thin hair, wide, small-chinned mouth, <hi rend="italic">baggy,</hi> wrinkly care-accustomed face; greatly the air of a Radical. I observed that he had a high forehead, and low crown; as in M&#xfc;llner&#x2019;s head. We had a pleasant, discursive sitting; about Scotch scenery, Buonaparte, Cobbett, Immorality, and the Tax on Tobacco. I volunteered to call again (for he can call nowhere), which was warmly welcomed. Nothing great will ever come of the man; no genial relation will ever spring up between us: yet he is worth being known, and honoured in his way; <foreign><hi rend="italic">jeder an seiner Stelle</hi></foreign> [everyone in his place]. Mill promises me two other friends: small deer, as I dread; yet will I see them gladly, being <foreign><hi rend="italic">niemals menschenscheu</hi></foreign> [never shy of people], as was Schmelzle&#x2019;s case<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Richter&#x2019;s &#x201C;Schmelzle&#x2019;s Journey to Flaetz,&#x201D; translated by Carlyle and published in <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>. The meeting at Fonblanque&#x2019;s is also described in <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, pp. 213&#x2013;14.</note> too. On the whole, this London is the most <hi rend="italic">twilight</hi> intellectual city you could <hi rend="italic">meet</hi> with: a meaner more utterly despicable view of man and his interests than stands pictured even in the better heads you could nowhere fall in with.</p>
<p>I ought to have mentioned earlier that Mr Maclae<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> called one day to say that he would carry any Letters &#x26;c to you: but I did not send any, which perhaps was as well, for I think now you will hardly meet. Also that Dr Irving<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Irving, brother of Edward.</note> one morning brought me over a Letter for you from one Haig<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably George F. Haig, from Dumfriesshire, who had been a student-contemporary of John&#x2019;s at Edinburgh.</note> a Medical fellow student (for I broke it up), congratulating &#x26;c, and then asking your counsel about settling in London: &#x201C;Dr Gordon (?) had told him there was an opening in the City.&#x201D; The good George undertook to answer him; in the negative. George comes here pretty frequently, and we like him much as an honourable good young man: he and I settled <hi rend="italic">handsomely</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">as friends.</hi> Arbuckle<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311227-JWC-MWE-01">JWC to <sic>MW</sic><corr>MWE</corr>, <sic><date when="1831-12-00">Dec. 1831</date></sic><corr><date when="1831-12-27">27 Dec. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> we have also had once, with as much favour as usual; Mensbier<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Mensbier, German translator, who, for example, translated Thomas Day&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of Little Jack.</hi></note> has not found us out yet, but has been inquiring<supplied>[.]</supplied> An invitation for him was left. Glen is much desiderated: the whole Montague world (except Basil) have repeatedly assaulted me about him: altogether <pb id="pg-06-33" n="06:33"/>for nought and in vain. These people see a quarter of an inch into everything; deeper into nothing.&#x2014; Of poor Edward Irving I have seen little and wish I had heard nothing since you went away. Alas! the &#x201C;gift of tongues&#x201D; has now broken loud out (last Sunday) in his Church, the creature Campbell (or Caird or whatever she is) having started up in the forenoon; and (as the matter was encouraged by Irving) <hi rend="italic">four</hi> others in the evening, when there ensued as I learn something like a perfect Bedlam scene, some groaning, some laughing, hooting, hooing, and several fainting. The Newspapers have got it, and call upon his people for the honour of Scotland to leave him, or muzzle him. The most general hypothesis is that he is a <hi rend="italic">quack;</hi> the milder that he is getting cracked. Poor George is the man I pity most: he spoke to us of it almost with tears in his eyes; and earnestly entreated me to <hi rend="italic">deal</hi> with his Brother; which, when he comes hither (by appointment on Tuesday) I partly mean to attempt, tho&#x2019; now I fear it will be useless. It seems likely that all the <hi rend="italic">Loselism</hi> [lazy rascality] of London will be about the church next Sunday; that his people will quarrel with him; in any case, that troublous times are appointed him. My poor friend! And yet the punishment was not unjust; that he who believed without inquiry, should now believe against all light, and portentously call upon the world to admire as inspiration what is but a dancing on the verge of bottomless abysses of Madness! I see not the end of it; who does?</p>
<p>But now, dear Brother, having so nigh filled my Paper with tattle, such as I had, let me turn for a moment specially to yourself. I think I may congratulate you on having made a fair beginning, and promise myself that you will handsomely get thro&#x2019; this business, and find it the beginning of better. Your ideas about your course seem to me perfectly just: the rule you have to follow is simple enough; neither do I doubt but you have force in you to follow it. Do all the good you can; willingly sacrifice any merely selfish interest to the interest of her you have to guide: think wisely, and act wisely (as our dear Mother would say, with the fear of God, and no fear of Man but love of him, before your eyes): who knows but you may prove a real blessing to this Lady, whose life, all but in the matter of mere money, is as yet one of the barrenest.&#x2014; For your own behoof too keep looking, and <hi rend="italic">noting</hi> (I mean <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> also), and gathering insight wheresoever it is to be had. You will see lands enough and peoples enough, and may improve yourself many ways; I wish we heard of you safe over the Alps, and could picture you in some settled state. Write the instant you read this, and count on hearing as rapidly again. Finally, dear <pb id="pg-06-34" n="06:34"/>Brother, love me, and fare well! If better days are appointed, let us study to deserve them; if worse, to meet them. Honest and true we may and can always be found. God be ever with you! So prays also your Sister here, and&#x2014;<closer><salute>Your faithful Brother&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>I sent on your <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> to W.

<p>We have heard from Mrs Welsh but from no one else in Dumf<hi rend="italic">sre</hi>. Both Arbuckle and George desire specially to be remembered. I think they both have a real friendship for you. Napier who wrote in bed (being sick) said nothing about your Article on Digestion: I still think you should attempt it, for your own sake.

<salute>My dear Helen</salute>
<p>Occasionally of late days, my heart has been agitated with dark forebodings respecting my mantle and shawl. Especially when I am going out at nights, I ask myself in a mournful manner where are they? &#x2018;and echo answers where&#x2019;?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Byron, <hi rend="italic">The Bride of Abydos,</hi> II, l, 663.</note> If still safe at Maryland Street, pray have <pb id="pg-06-35" n="06:35"/>the goodness to pack them up, and despatch them hither with all decent celerity; by any conveyance short <supplied>[of]</supplied> the Mail-bag&#x2014;and if they have already been sent off; write and tell me that I may possess my soul in patience; or if necessary make inquiry after them; or at worst provide myself with other wrappages.</p>
<p>I like London very well&#x2014;and expect I shall like it still better in a week or two when some of the people my Husband likes best shall have returned to town. I have been at no public place yet except once to Drury Lane theatre where we saw the silliest piece in the world&#x2014;rather indifferently performed. but the house especially the beautiful lustre in the centre of it were well worth looking at&#x2014; Not so the Ladies who surprised me by their almost universal ugliness&#x2014; One day I went with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu to Epping Forest&#x2014;about fifteen miles from town&#x2014;to visit Doctor Allan<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matthew Allen. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200519-TC-MAL-01"><sic>1:250</sic><corr>TC to MAL, <date when="1820-05-19">19 May 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> a Scotchman who has a lunatic establishment in the midst of the Forest&#x2014;a place where any sane person might be delighted to get admission. the house or rather houses (for there are two for patients in different stages of lunacy) are all overhung with roses and grapes and surrounded with gardens ponds and shrubbery without the smallest appearance of constraint&#x2014; And the poor creatures are all so happy. and there [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> such a good humane Man&#x2014;that it does not at all produce the painful impression that Asylums of that sort usually do&#x2014; I am going back to stay some days&#x2014; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Allan is an old friend of Carlyle&#x2019;s and his Wife is a very excellent woman&#x2014; A far worse Bedlam is poor Edward Irving&#x2019;s house where people are to be found at all hours &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">speaking with tongues</hi>&#x201D; that is to say shrieking and howling in no tongue. I happened to be there one night just when a Lady was under the inspiration of &#x2018;the Spirit&#x2019;; and the horrible sounds she made almost threw me who am not of a hysterical temperament into a fit. I could not help crying all the way home. Indeed it is truly distressing to see a man of such talents and such really good and pious dispositions as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving given up to an infatuation so absurd&#x2014;ready to sacrifice to it his dearest friends, his reputation, all his worldly prospects. Most people think it all a humbug&#x2014;which is quite reasonable in those who do not <hi rend="italic">know</hi> him. but a man more sincere in his professions does not exist.</p>
<p>We are going out of town for a few days on a visit to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Badams at Enfield&#x2014; His wife is about my age, very pretty and lively and clever she is a daughter of Holcroft&#x2019;s whom you may have heard of&#x2014; We had Allan Cunningham at tea with us the other evening&#x2014; He is a most <pb id="pg-06-36" n="06:36"/>sufficient poet as I ever met with&#x2014;so substantially built both bodily and mentally&#x2014;looking in all respects precisely what he is&#x2014;a cultivated Scotch mason. Procter (Barry Cornwall) we see often&#x2014;and his wife who is M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu&#x2019;s daughter is my most intimate acquaintance here. But among all the literary people that come about us the one I like best is M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Mill, son of Mill the Utilitarian, but <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is no Utilitarian&#x2014;he belongs rather to the class to which my Husband belongs and which for want of a fitter name has been called &#x201C;the Mystic school&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jeffrey is getting slowly better&#x2014;he was able to drive this length the other day&#x2014;and is going a little way into the country till the Parliament meets&#x2014; I suppose you are all at a stand in your speculations about the Reform Bill in Liverpool as elsewhere&#x2014; Here every body I see seems quite tired of thinking about it.</p>
<p>We continue to be well pleased with our lodgings&#x2014;indeed if we had sought all London I believe we could not have settled more to our mind. They even make us excellent porri<supplied>[d]</supplied>ge now<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>How are my Uncle&#x2019;s eyes? and how are you all<supplied>[?]</supplied> My love and best wishes to all from your Father and Mother down to Johnny&#x2014;and now I must go and pack for our little journey.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We have often been speaking of you and thinking of you this week, and of what a quandary your fears must have thrown you into; especially after the arrival of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> with its &#x201C;Bristol Riots,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The trouble, reported in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> for <date when="1831-11-06">6 Nov.</date> and in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, was sparked off by the appointment of Sir Charles Wetherell (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310817-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-17">17 Aug.</date></ref>) as recorder for Bristol by the town council and magistrates. Sir Charles had voted against reform and subsequently asked for a &#x201C;Special Commission&#x201D; to try the Nottingham rioters. The poor and disenfranchised rioted, plundered, and burned the town during <date when="1831-10-29">29</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-10-31">31 Oct.</date> at the appearance of Sir Charles to open the court of assize. Sir Charles was stoned, and 45 houses, including the Mansion House, the Custom House, and the Bishop&#x2019;s Palace, were burned. Three jails were broken into and the prisoners freed. The outbreak was put down only after troops were used and they had fired on the crowd. Twelve rioters were killed by the soldiers; several perished in fires; four were hanged; thirty imprisoned. Damage to the city was at first estimated by the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> at half a million pounds, later as &#xa3;68,208. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, which supported reform, speaks of Wetherell&#x2019;s &#x201C;outrageous conduct on the liberties of the people of late&#x201D; (<date when="1831-11-01">1 Nov.</date>).</note> stack-burnings, Cholera morbus, and nothing on all hands but broken heads, broken hearts, woe, want, wickedness and madness over the whole world.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov.</date></ref> For the cholera, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310815-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-15">15 Aug.</date></ref> The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> for <date when="1831-11-06">6 Nov.</date> declared: &#x201C;Incendiarism is increasing to an alarming extent throughout the country. Nearly all the local papers of the last week contain accounts of outrages of that description, in which much valuable property has been destroyed.&#x201D;</note> In all this, I doubt not, your too anxious imagination often represented the possibility of some one dear to you being some how or other involved. I had determined on writing to you, at any rate, to quiet you with assurance that all went its old course; in which determination the arrival of Jack&#x2019;s Letter yesterday with nothing but good tidings confirmed me. Altho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">franks</hi> are not easily to be come at for the present, our Advocate being out of London, I was minded not to stop on that account; for I knew that you would think the postage <hi rend="italic">cheap</hi>, were it your last coin: however, it comes about almost by accident that I fall in with an &#x201C;Honourable Member&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Hyde Villiers (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">32</date>), politician, M.P. at this time for Bletchingley and previously, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">30</date>, for Hedon, Yorkshire. He had been a civil servant in the colonial office from <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> and became a close friend of John Stuart Mill. From <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date> he went into politics as a reformer and Benthamite, being increasingly concerned with poor law reform, Indian and Irish affairs.</note> this morning; <pb id="pg-06-38" n="06:38"/>from whom having secured a frank, I can now write you our news with all deliberation, enclose Jack&#x2019;s Letter, and make a quite complete job of it. Which grateful service I now proceed with all heartiness to perform.</p>
<p>There is no doubt but these are threatening times, full of risk and distress: a country agitated with political discontent, with economical embarrassment; the lower orders, straitened by want, exasperated by disappointment, all ready for <hi rend="italic">any</hi> kind of change, whether by revolt or otherwise; nowhere any Wisdom, any Faithfulness to give them counsel; and now while the dark winter is setting in, a pestilential malady arrived on our coasts, to carry off doubtless many into the land of Silence! Truly may we say, God&#x2019;s judgements are abroad on the Earth: it behoves us all, and each of us for himself, to think deeply of it, and so far as strength is given us, with our whole heart, to &#x201C;consider our ways and be wise.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 6:6.</note> Nevertheless there is always this strong tower of Defence, that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> of God&#x2019;s ordering; that not a hair of our head, of the very meanest head, can fall to the ground without his command;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle mixes two well-known Biblical statements: &#x201C;But the very hairs of your head are all numbered&#x201D; (Matt. 10:30) and &#x201C;Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father&#x201D; (Matt. 10:29).</note> and the Faith, which is the beginning and the end of Knowledge teaches us that He commands all things <hi rend="italic">well</hi>. The greater too ought to be our thankfulness, that <hi rend="italic">we</hi>, as a household and kindred, are all spared; and still called only to sympathize with these miseries, not to share in them. Such thoughts, often or rather always more or less distinctly present in my mind, arm me as with triple steel<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 568&#x2013;69.</note> against all the mad vicissitudes of this mad Existence; which I look upon rather as a heavy Dream, wherefrom, when the Night is past, we shall awaken to a fair Morning! God is great; God also is good:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310201-TC-JCA-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCA</corr>, <date when="1831-02-01">1 Feb.</date></ref></note> this is the sum-total of all the Wisdom I could ever learn.</p>
<p>To come into mere narrative (for my Paper, broad as it is, will not hold everything), I will congratulate you on poor Jack&#x2019;s welfare, safe passage of the Alps, and general good outlook; all which you will at your leisure decipher in his close-filled Letter. I will write him again very soon, to Florence where he must already be; and gratify his heart by the good tidings (I hope, <hi rend="italic">still</hi> true) which I had from Scotsbrig, and more lately from Alick, who also has written me. You must give my <hi rend="italic">best</hi> thanks to Jane, and the other kind contributors who made up <pb id="pg-06-39" n="06:39"/>that Letter, which was worth its weight in precious metal to me: tell them also not to be slack in repeating the operation, and that the oftener they do it, they will find it the easier. By the way, it might have struck me, that this Letter ought properly to have been directed to <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi>: but after all, it is a common good, come in whose name it may; and somehow it is most natural for me to address myself to the &#x201C;general meeting&#x201D; with <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in the chair.</p>
<p>There would have been some other Letters today, but my Goodwifie is unfortunately in bed (and I hope, at this moment, asleep): she has had a kind of disagreeable cold for some days; not coughing, but sneezing occasionally, and what she calls <hi rend="italic">sniftering:</hi> so I, having this morning to go out to breakfast, strictly charged her not to rise; but to lie warm and take some prescriptions that I had ordered her; all which she has obediently done, and now lies, I hope, &#x201C;in the fair way of recovery&#x201D;: if not, I will try her again tomorrow. Her general health has been decidedly better, since she came hither; and she sees and hears many things to gratify her, and perhaps profitably.</p>
<p>As for myself, I feel in some measure getting to my feet again, after so long stumbling. Some time ago, I actually began a Paper<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Characteristics.&#x201D;</note> for the Edinburgh Review, at which I am daily working: my hand was sadly out; but by resolute endeavour, I feel that it will come in again, and I shall perhaps make a tolerable story of it. So long as I can work, it is all well with me; I care for nothing. The <hi rend="italic">only</hi> thing I have to struggle against is Idleness and Falsehood: these are the two Devil&#x2019;s Emissaries that, did I give them head, would work all my woe. My <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> still lies quite safe in the Drawer, and I doubt must lie till Reform-Bill work is over: however, I think of beginning a new set of trials soon among the Booksellers, for there are some slight symptoms of Trade beginning to stir in that quarter again. At the same time, one must not <hi rend="italic">hawk</hi> a Manuscript, or the blockheads begin to think it is nothing worth. A considerable Paper<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;German Literature of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, VIII (<date when="1831-10-00">Oct. 1831</date>), 347&#x2013;91.</note> of mine came out the other day in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi> (Cochrane&#x2019;s), which with several other things that you have not yet seen I hope to show you and get you to read when I return. Cochrane&#x2019;s pay, which I will demand when its time of need comes, will serve to keep <hi rend="italic">mall in shaft</hi> [things going] till we turn northward.&#x2014; Meanwhile all goes on as well as we could hope. Our Lodgings continue very comfortable, and very cheap; so that we can <hi rend="italic">both</hi> live for little more than it used in my last London residence <pb id="pg-06-40" n="06:40"/>to cost me alone. The people are very cleanly, polite, decent-minded people; they have seen better days, and seem to have a heart above their lot.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Miles family. The daughter, Eliza (later Mrs. Snowden), according to Carlyle, &#x201C;fell quite in love&#x201D; with Jane. The family had been &#x201C;reduced from wealth to keep lodgings, and prettily resigned to it; really good people.&#x201D; See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 92; II, 202.</note> Both of us sleep well; our health is fully of the old quality; we eat and breathe and have wherewith to eat and breathe: for honest Thinking and honest Acting the materials are <hi rend="italic">everywhere</hi> laid down to one.</p>
<p>Except the printing of my Book, or rather the trying for it so long as there seems any good chance, I have no special call at London. Nevertheless, there are many profitable chances for me here; especially many persons with whom I find much encouragement and perhaps improvement in associating. A considerable knot of <hi rend="italic">young</hi> men in particular I discover here, that have had their eyes on me, and wish for insight from me: with these it seems quite possible some good may sometime be done. Among that number was my Landlord this morning; a secretary in one of the Government offices, whom I met with for the first time: he had a whole party to meet me; four of the best-mannered, most pleasant persons I have for a long time seen. All ingenuous persons, &#x201C;lying,&#x201D; what so few do, &#x201C;open to light.&#x201D; The disciple or associate I have most to do with is one John Mill (the son of a Scotchman of eminence) acquainted with the Bullers &#x26;c, who is a great favourite here. It was he that brought about my meeting this morning with my &#x201C;Secretary&#x201D; (called Taylor)<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Taylor (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">86</date>), civil servant, poet, and dramatist. He had been a clerk in the colonial office in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>, where he was a friend and colleague of Thomas Hyde Villiers. He remained in the civil service until <date when="1872-00-00">1872</date> and was knighted in <date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>. He does not mention meeting Carlyle as early as <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date> in his <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> (London, <date when="1885-00-00">1885</date>), I, 159&#x2013;60, but does refer to his &#x201C;breakfasts prolonged from ten o&#x2019;clock to three by the charm of Charles Austin&#x2019;s bold and buoyant vivacities, &#x2026; the searching insights of John Mill, &#x2026; the gibes and mockeries of Charles Villiers, and the almost feminine grace combined with the masculine intellect of Hyde.&#x201D; For Taylor on Carlyle, see I, 325&#x2013;32.</note> and his friends, whom I hope to see again. Charles Buller also has come to town: he made his appearance here the other day, was in about an hour followed by Mill; and the two made what Jane called &#x201C;a pleasant forenoon call of five hours and a half.&#x201D; Charles is grown a great tower of a fellow, six feet three in height, a yard in breadth; shows great talent, and great natural goodness, which I hope he will by and by turn to notable account. I met him and Strachey amid the raw-frosty fog of Piccadilly this morning, and expect to see him some evening soon. Mrs Strachey is just returned from the country (Devonshire) <pb id="pg-06-41" n="06:41"/>whence she had written us a very kind true-looking Letter, and we expect to see her soon.&#x2014; The Montagues go hovering much about us; but their intercourse is of inferior profit, their whole way of life has a certain hollowness, so that you nowhere find firm bottom: one must try to take the good out of each, and keep aloof from the evil that lies everywhere mixed with it.</p>
<p>Irving comes but little in our way; and one does not like to go and seek him in his own house, in a whole posse of enthusiasts, ranters and silly women. He was here once, taking tea, since that work of the &#x201C;Tongues&#x201D; began: I told him with great earnestness my deepseated unhesitating conviction that it was <hi rend="italic">no</hi> special work of the Holy Spirit, or of any Spirit save of that black frightful unclean one that dwells in Bedlam. He persists mi<supplied>[l]</supplied>dly-obstinate in his Course; greatly strengthened therein by his wife, who is reckoned the beginner of it all: the Newspaper accounts are sometimes overcharged;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> made editorial comments on <date when="1831-10-26">26</date> and <date when="1831-10-29">29 Oct.</date> It said nothing of the scenes on <date when="1831-11-06">6 Nov.</date>, but it did have a brief report on <date when="1831-11-21">21 Nov.</date> of further disturbances. Its comments were moderate; other newspapers were possibly more outspoken.</note> yet a certain &#x201C;speaking with tongues&#x201D; does I understand go on daily in his Chapel, which lies very near us, which as I pass it I see mostly open, and often a <foreign><hi rend="italic">dawnering</hi></foreign> [strolling] <hi rend="italic">individual</hi> or two popping in, or popping out: &#x201C;but and ben the change-house fills.&#x201D;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns, &#x201C;Holy Fair,&#x201D; stanza 18; &#x201C;change-house&#x201D; is &#x201C;ale-house&#x201D; and &#x201C;but and ben&#x201D; the &#x201C;inner and outer rooms,&#x201D; i.e., every room.</note> They tell us that poor Dow of Irongrey has also taken to the tongue-work. What it will all lead to I pretend not to prophecy: I do not think it can spread to any extent even among the vulgar here, at this time of day; only a small knot of ravers now rave in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> old worn-out direction: but for Irving himself the consequences frighten me. That he will lose his Congregation seems calculated on by his friends: but perhaps a far darker fear is not out of the question; namely that he may lose his own wits. God guard him from such a consummation! None of you, I am sure, will join in any ill-natured clamour against him: defend him rather with brotherly charity; and hope always that he will yet be delivered from this real Delusion of the Devil.</p>
<p>Jane wanted me to tell her of the Examiner Editor; but I have not space here. The poor fellow has been thrown out of a Gig, and is tediously lame; so I have not yet seen him here: neither was he at home when I pilgrimed over (3&#xBD; miles to a spot in the west suburbs, not unlike Comley Bank) the other day, but gone to Brighton for sea air. My ideas therefore were only formed by candle light. He is a long <pb id="pg-06-42" n="06:42"/>thin <foreign><hi rend="italic">tawtie</hi></foreign> [shaggy] -headed man, with wrinkly (even baggy) face, keen zealous-looking eyes, a sort of bell-toned honestly argumentative voice: very much the air of a truehearted Radical. He was all braced with straps, moving on crutches, and hung together loosely, you would have said, as by <foreign><hi rend="italic">flail-cappins</hi></foreign><supplied>[.]</supplied><note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leather hinges of a flail.</note> However we got along bravely together; and parted, after arguing, and assenting, and laughing and mourning at considerable length&#x2014;with mutual purpose to meet again. I rather like the man: there is far more in him than in the most of radicals; besides he means <hi rend="italic">honestly</hi>, and has a real feeling where the shoe pinches, namely, that the grand misery is the condition of the poor classes.</p>
<p>Speaking of Newspapers, I may here tell you what I mean to do about M&#x2019;Diarmid&#x2019;s.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Dumfries and Galloway <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>.</note> To me the Paper is of very inferior interest (chiefly except the Advertisements), and I could well do with it two days later: often I remember what my Father said: that it was &#x201C;wholly a Hypothesis,&#x201D; which indeed is the best possible description of it.&#x2014; I have written therefore to M&#x2019;Diarmid to send it on <hi rend="italic">first</hi> to you; then if you can put it back into the Post-office any time before Thursday afternoon (or even before <hi rend="italic">Saturday; Friday</hi> is of no use for there is no London Post that day) it would arrive here on the Saturday forenoon, and could still be read and sent back to Alick for Wednesday, which is as soon as he could <supplied>[get it?]</supplied> any way. Nay even the <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> (at the Ecclefechan Post-office) would do, for I should <supplied>[ge]</supplied>t it on Monday, and send it off that evening. I care very little about it; the cover <supplied>[with?]</supplied> one of your handwritings would probably be the best thing about it for me. Despatch that Letter to M&#x2019;Diarmid, therefore, on Wednesday next, and the following week expect that the new arrangement will begin.&#x2014;&#x2014; So much for business.</p>
<p>I had much to write about the State of matters here, and to quiet your fears especially about the Cholera, which so many torment themselves with. It is in truth a disease of no such terrific quality, only that its effect is sudden, and the people have heard so much about it: scarcely a year but there is a <hi rend="italic">typhus fever</hi> in Glasgow or Edinburgh that kills far <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than the Cholera does in the like cases. For my part I am even satisfied rather that it has reached our Coasts (where I have long inevitably expected it) and that now the Reality which is measurable will succeed the Terror which is immeasurable, and doing great mischief both to individual peace of mind, and all kinds of commercial intercourse. The worst effect here will be that same interruption; <pb id="pg-06-43" n="06:43"/>thus already the Coals (which come from Northumberland) are beginning to rise.&#x2014; On the whole, however, it is our purpose to run no unnecessary risks: therefore should the danger really come near us, and the Disease break out in London under a shape in any measure formidable; we will <hi rend="italic">forthwith bundle our gear</hi> and return to Puttoch till it is over. This we have resolved on: so disquiet not yourself my dear Mother; there is no peril for the present; nay it is a hundred miles nearer <hi rend="italic">you</hi> than us.&#x2014; As to rioting, and all that sort of matter, there is no symptom of it here; neither in case of its actual occurrence have persons like <hi rend="italic">us</hi> anything to fear. We are safer here, I take it, than we should be in Dunscore itself.</p>
<p>I must now conclude, dear Mother, in very great haste; for the Post hour is at my very hand, and the note to M&#x2019;Diarmid is still unwritten&#x2014; (By the way, <hi rend="italic">if you do not like to engage</hi>, you have only to burn that note, and it is done: I know not how much or little you care about the Hypothesis, and so cannot judge. The Examiner you will always get on Wednesday).&#x2014;I had innumerable things to say, and kind messages to send; but my space is all exhausted. Take care of yourself my dear Mother, and of my Father: neither of you should expose yourself to any weather or rough treatment; it is a positive <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> for you. My Father&#x2019;s Letter is still owing, but the debt not forgotten: assure him of my true affection. Cheer him, when he grows dispirited; he has struggled long, and now should lean a little on the rest of us. Jean and Jenny &#x26; Mary the writers I must thank a second time. Tell them to write soon. I will write, if aught notable happen, <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi>. <closer><salute>Farewell dear Mother! God bless you all!</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>We were out at Enfield, with the Badamses for four days: that was the reason why your Examiner would once come a day too late; also why you had once to pay <hi rend="italic">twopence</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> (it was the girl&#x2019;s stupidity, that last). The Badam<supplied>[s]</supplied>es were very hospitable and kind; seemed to be living in a strange unstaid sort of way: Badams is much better, but still far from well&#x2014;I mean in mind chiefly. I hope the best for him. Jeffrey has been in Wimbledon (10 miles off) for about 10 days. He is getting better, but very slowly, and looks thin. Jane bids me thank the Sisterhood for their Letter (or perhaps it was only Mary in particular) and say that she will answer it. <hi rend="italic">Maister Cairlill</hi> has not put pen to paper yet: Jane and I both expect to see his hand soon; but regards to him from both of us. Send my love to Alick: I <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> to write tonight, and <hi rend="italic">will</hi> soon.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have still leisure to write you a few lines &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">with my own hand</hi>&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Written &#x2018;with my own hand,&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Noble Lady&#x2019; (Mrs Basil Montague) are phrases of Edw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Irving&#x2019;s&#x2014;supposed to be too high-flown for their respective occasions&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> to thank you for your kind messages and kind thoughts, which are infinitely precious in this land of strangers. Many people here shew a disposition to be kind to me as this world goes; but that sort of dinner-giving speech-making kindness is but frothy unsatisfactory food for the heart, compared with the kindness one experiences in the bosom of one&#x2019;s own family: and I have now been so long and so intimately connected with you and yours that I cannot but look upon you all as my own Mother and Brothers and Sisters.</p>
<p>I should find myself very pleasantly situated here if I enjoyed my usual health, and could avail myself of the various invitations that are held out to us.</p>
<p>Carlyle has tolerable health and spirits, and abundant <hi rend="italic">prospects</hi> of employment. There is much to see and wonder at, even in a solitary walk along the streets; and enough of people come about us to talk, or rather to listen, among whom there are several whom I really like.</p>
<p>The little Dear is well again, and as gay as a lark; and trudges over to us twice a week, without women or equipage. Always losing himself by the way, and needing Carlyle to take him home.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The &#x2018;Little Dear&#x2019; is Jeffrey, now L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Advocate, living in Jermyn street,&#x2014;worried almost to death.

<p>I have at last seen M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Austin; and, so far as one could judge by a forenoon call, I think her the best woman I have yet found here. In appearance she is extremely like our Nancy,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;This is <hi rend="italic">Thornhill</hi> &#x2018;Nancy,&#x2019; another than the Dumfries one or &#x2018;Piggie.&#x2019; This one used to spoil my razors, privately dealing with a <hi rend="italic">beard</hi> she had; otherwise not much comparable to the &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">bellissima Barbata</hi></foreign>,&#x2019;&#x2014;as Jeffrey used to call this Mrs Austin, translatress of German &#x26;c,&#x2014;<foreign>femme alors cel&#xE8;bre!</foreign>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;but drawn out to a considerable length, and her countenance refined and spiritualized. Her talk is all about books; and, tho&#x2019; I should not imagine her a much <pb id="pg-06-45" n="06:45"/>cleverer person than myself, her command of what talent she has will I find give her quite the upper-hand in any intercourse we may have.</p>
<p>Of the &#x201C;Noble Lady&#x201D; least said is soonest mended&#x2014; God keep you all&#x2014;My love to all of you down to the prattler over the way.</p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Perhaps I cannot better employ this fine Sunday morning than in writing you a long deliberate Letter. I am sitting in perfect solitude; a clear little coal-fire burning at my right hand; the sun, with as much vigour as a winter sun may, shining on the opposite houses: all the people shut up in churches or parlours; all things exhibiting a Sabbath stillness, and inviting to clear kind thoughts of the absent Loved.&#x2014; Your well-filled, welcome Letter came last Wednesday, almost a fortnight before I could look for it; and next evening, accompanied with a copious Communication from my own hand, was on its way to Scotsbrig. I may mention here too that, about a week before, I had had a Letter from Alick, and somewhat earlier one from a whole sisterhood of the Scotsbrig people: both households were well, and in their usual course of avocation; our Father standing the winter, so far, better than usual, our Mother also pretty healthy; Alick digging his potatoes in the solitudes of Craigenputtoch, and except that &#x201C;like his great namesake of Alexander Selkirk he ran risk of altogether losing the gift of speech,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Selkirk (<date when="1676-00-00">1676</date>&#x2013;<date when="1721-00-00">1721</date>), Scottish sailor, the original of Defoe&#x2019;s Robinson Crusoe, was set ashore alone at his own request on one of the Juan Fern&#xE1;ndez islands in <date when="1704-00-00">1704</date>, where he remained for over four years.</note> and moreover was a little disturbed at night &#x201C;by the nursing of little Jane Welsh Carlyle,&#x201D; to all appearance well enough to live. He had offered (he did not say what) for the Dairlaw Hills Farm; but the matter was not decided, and probably is not yet. They seem to have calculated that he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> enough of capital for that enterprise; and, in other respects, I think the vicinity to Scotsbrig would be a great point with him; so that, on the whole, I wish him an affirmative result. Some fixed employment seems to be becoming <pb id="pg-06-46" n="06:46"/>every way an essential for poor Alick; and, as I calculate, <hi rend="italic">would</hi> actually save him from peril. In Annandale, as I learned, &#x201C;the people at Mill and Smithy were universally talking of Edward Irving as a man that had long been mad, and had now only <hi rend="italic">broken loose&#x201D;:</hi> our Mother charged and entreated me to send her instant notice of your safe arrival over the Alps, which notice her kind heart must this very day be enjoying: these I think are all the news from &#x201C;our Native&#x201D; that are worth specifying here. Let us be thankful and contented that there is so much of good, in a world and a time so evil.</p>
<p>Happy were we to hear also of your welfare, and that all things outward and inward seemed to prosper with you. Doubtless in that, as in all human relations, you will have your perplexities to disentangle, for in everything there is a right way and a wrong: yet certainly matters look smooth enough hitherto; and we can trust to your prudence for steering you thro&#x2019; worse than the worst is like to prove. Be wary, be honest; listen not to the voice of Indolence crying out for Ease, but to the small still whisper of Duty: this is everywhere the rule. I fully agree with you that Employment would be the best of all medicines for your Patient: neither is Employment, or can it be in a world existing by Labour, impossible to find; whether for Peasantess or Princess. Unfortunately, however, it is often very difficult to find: thus Swing<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310120-TC-MN-01">TC to MN, <date when="1831-01-20">20 Jan.</date></ref></note> burns ricks, thus Byron writes Satanic Poetry. What man wants is always that the Highest in his nature be <hi rend="italic">set</hi> at the top, and actively reign there. Did Lady Clare seem imbued with a religious feeling, were it only in the &#x201C;lean and narrow&#x201D; style of her companion,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Clare&#x2019;s traveling companion was a Miss Morris, also known to the Stracheys. John described her in his letter of <date when="1831-10-29">29 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;She is rather handsome, clever, vehement, courageous though apparently very timorous, has not found her place &#x26; duty in the world, &#x26; is much narrowed &#x26; hemmed in by the darkness &#x26; lean intolerance of the &#x2018;Evangelical party&#x2019; to which she zealously adheres.&#x201D;</note> the road to wholesome Activity (such as Beneficence, Self-culture, conscientious creation of the Good) and thereby to peace of mind, were easier; for there you have <hi rend="italic">a</hi> vehicle, tho&#x2019; now a somewhat crazy one. In any case, she has a moral nature, wherein lies the root of weal or woe: this could you but awaken and aliment with fit food, you were her lasting highest benefactor. Perhaps in German Literature (as Literature is now our only symbol of the Highest, and German our only Literature) there may lie some hope. However, you will need to go cautiously to work; to throw out your suggestion as if by accident and historically, that you may not seem to usurp and make <pb id="pg-06-47" n="06:47"/>yourself a Tutor. Respect, deference, is dear to every one; <hi rend="italic">most of all</hi> to the female heart. On the whole, dear Jack, <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> faithfully to do well, and better and better light will arise on you. I have still great hopes that you have here entered on a relation, which may prove the beginning of great good to you; that by means of it your painful wanderings may at length cease, and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ort und Stelle</hi></foreign> [very place] where you are finally to strike down and break ground, and labour (with marked <hi rend="italic">effect,</hi> for this too is in you) become manifest. Let us all walk &#x201C;as ever in our great Taskmaster&#x2019;s eye&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Milton&#x2019;s sonnet &#x201C;How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth.&#x201D;</note> in all sufferings bow meekly down before that Highest Presence; in all actions walk by that Highest Guidance! This many hard lessons (for which be God also thanked) have taught me as the beginning of all Knowledge.&#x2014; For yourself too you must be laying in much spiritual wealth; pictures at least of grand objects, Alps and Cities and Memorials of Men are ministered in abundance. By <hi rend="italic">no</hi> means neglect to keep a journal:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had said that he was keeping a journal in his letter from Turin of <date when="1831-10-29">29 Oct.</date></note> you will understand everything the better as well as remember it the better. It is not every one that can see Florence; go at evening to the top of Fiesole, wander in Val d&#x2019;Arno, or among the autumnal leaves of Vallombrosa;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> I, 302&#x2013;3.</note> or gaze of the Medici Gallery and the Moses of Michel Angelo and the Perseus of friend Benvenuto.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Benvenuto Cellini (<date when="1500-00-00">1500</date>&#x2013;<date when="1571-00-00">71</date>), Italian goldsmith and sculptor, who tells in the fourth book of his <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> how he cast the statue of Perseus, now at Florence.</note> Tell me a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> about all this; but chiefly of your humane relations, of yourself and your <foreign><hi rend="italic">Befinden</hi></foreign> [health] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Umgebung</hi></foreign> [surroundings], for &#x201C;it is men only that interest men,&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Carlyle&#x2019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works,</hi> XXIII, 131; Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor,</hi> p. 75.</note> much more brother that interests brother. I will send on your Letter to Scotsbrig, unless you wish otherwise: any <hi rend="italic">secret</hi> thing you can put in some foreign language by your &#x201C;gift of tongues.&#x201D; I was much instructed by your sketches of Saint Simonism; concerning which I do not differ far from you in opinion or prediction. It is an upholstery aggregation, not a Promethean creation; therefore cannot live long: yet the very attempt to rebuild the old dilapidated Temple, were it only with deals and canvas is significant.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his last letter John had given Carlyle a vivid account of a Saint-Simonian &#x201C;predication&#x201D; (sermon and prayers) which he had attended in Paris: &#x201C;I went to the <hi rend="italic">predication</hi> according to appointment with Gustave D&#x2019;Eichthal. I found my little <foreign><hi rend="italic">Salle</hi></foreign> quite crowded; the &#x2018;plush holes&#x2019; turned out to be nothing more than the fragments into which the galleries were subdivided; the centre of the stage had three large armchairs much gilt &#x26; ornamented the middle one rather farther from the front of the stage than the others. &#x2026; For half an hour after the rest of the house was full the chairs remained unoccupied, till at length gradually appeared the dignitaries who took places according to their rank from the sides towards the centre increasing in dignity but still leaving the three chairs vacant in the centre. I could observe Madame Bazard in front &#x26; next the centre with a dress distinguishing her from all the rest except one other lady also in front whose name I forget: she had a little silk velvet footstool where upon to display &#x2018;two of the neatest feet in the world.&#x2019; Suddenly the side door opened &#x26; those on the stage rose to honour the entrance of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">P&#xE8;res</hi></foreign> Bazard &#x26; Enfantin, &#x26; the preacher Barault. The <foreign><hi rend="italic">p&#xE8;res</hi></foreign> <supplied>[John writes the word both times with an acute accent over the <hi rend="italic">e</hi>]</supplied> took their seats on the side chairs &#x26; Barault in the middle upon which a pause ensued.
The preacher then rose &#x26; after repeating what seemed a sort of formula invoking or complimenting the &#x2018;fathers&#x2019; he went on in an outrageously theatrical style, interrupted now &#x26; then with cheering &#x26; clapping of hands, to declaim about Voltaire &#x26; Napoleon &#x26; St Simon &#x26; the law of progress, till he seemed on the point of dropping down for want of breath, &#x26; indeed was forced to stop while standing close upon his chair vehemently extolling the fathers from side to side. Barault is a lean, sallow, light-haired personage of about thirty; &#x26; he somewhat reminded me of Dow of Irongray. The Pere Bazard is a stoutish man with a look of intellect &#x26; mild obduracy: he seemed stiff &#x26; not at home in his chair of state. Enfantin is taller, stronger, has long hair, a high forehead, large eyes, strong Roman nose, an air of more pure &#x26; fearless enthusiasm, felt more at ease&#x2014; The <foreign>P&#xE9;res</foreign> and the preacher rose after the <hi rend="italic">predication</hi> &#x26; a pause &#x26; with them much of the audience, few remaining to hear the &#x2018;conference&#x2019; which succeeded&#x2014; In the afternoon I went to see the ceremony of admitting new members where Claire Bazard presided supported by two or three other male dignitaries. Two or three woebegone, care-afflicted, females came forward &#x26; read a sort of confession or profession after w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> C. Bazard shook hands with them &#x26; kissed them; &#x26; some young men of the same description one of whom was very obstreperous &#x26; irreverent were admitted with more or less cordiality on the same terms. The audience were then severally invited to put inquiries about St Simonianism &#x26; were answered with clearness &#x26; decision by Madame Bazard &#x26; her chief supporter a man in voice &#x26; manner &#x26; appearance like Peter Forest chastened &#x26; beautified. Madame Bazard is sharp, bold, clear, impetuous, militant. If Churchill were femininized [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] a little his appearance might give you some idea of hers. &#x2026; My second impression of the St S<hi rend="italic">s</hi> is rather more favourable but they must fail, I still think, very rapidly if no second revolution come to further them. I feel more astonished that they should attract so little attention in Paris with such an apparatus &#x26; display than I do at their having come into existence at this time of unrest &#x26; universal change &#x26; transition when France is making experiments for all Europe.&#x201D;</note> Adolphe <pb id="pg-06-48" n="06:48"/>d&#x2019;Eichthal is not returned from the North, nor do I yet know his time.</p>
<p>I am striving what I can to write small; nevertheless this pen is none of the most favourable, and the sheet is rapidly waning [<hi rend="italic">Monday morning the</hi> <date when="1831-11-14"><hi rend="italic">14</hi>th</date>.&#x2014; John Mill came in at this point yesterday, and sat till dinner; then in the evening we had Glen: so here I am still].<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The brackets are Carlyle&#x2019;s.</note> I meant to say that I must give you some news, and quit my speculations. <pb id="pg-06-49" n="06:49"/>Of ourselves there is little important to be said. We are as comfortable in the matter of lodgings and so forth as we could have hoped; a nice quiet place, with quiet respectable people; the only drawback (a necessary one) is want of room, so that I have often the feeling &#x201C;as if I were tied up in a sack.&#x201D; I have been endeavouring with some zeal to get a piece of writing done (on the &#x201C;Philosophy of this Era&#x201D;);<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This writing, based on Thomas Hope&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>) and Friedrich von Schlegel&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Lectures delivered at Dresden</hi> in <date when="1828-12-00">December 1828</date> and <date when="1829-01-00">January 1829</date> (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), became &#x201C;Characteristics,&#x201D; published in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> LIV (<date when="1831-12-00">Dec. 1831</date>).</note> but find my hand quite dreadfully out, and must still almost despair of getting honourably thro&#x2019; it. I find myself to a strange extent the servant of Habits; wherein lies a Poverty, yet also a Wealth, for the chief price of anything is its <foreign><hi rend="italic">pretium affectionis</hi></foreign> [price of affection]. I <hi rend="italic">will not</hi> give in; once for all <hi rend="italic">will not:</hi> that is the only course. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott</hi></foreign> [Oh Lord]! this is a thorny miry path one has to travel; and so dark, so intricate! Nevertheless, forward! forward! I am still meditating some sort of lecture-work: but as yet it lies at a great distance; my <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> is still <hi rend="italic">tacked</hi> [nailed]: could one but &#x201C;cut it with a sixpence,&#x201D; as they do to speaking Birds, and so give me utterance!&#x2014; Meanwhile I continue to look about me, and meet here and there with hopeful things. Chiefly among the young: the elder are hide-bound, and have ceased to grow or be green. Glen, as you heard, is returned; and bids fair (in spite of the Montague prognostication) to be a favourite with the Leddy here: I have appointed John Mill to meet him next Wednesday night, and shall see what relation springs up between them. I have also lent him <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi>k to read; which wonderful Book I am again cautiously bestirring myself to get printed, for the &#x201C;season&#x201D; has begun, and in rather brisker style than was anticipated.

I love Badams and would gladly help him if I could. As to Irving expect little tidings of him, I think I shall henceforth see little of him. His gift of tongues goes on apace, Glen says there was one performing yesterday; but on the whole, even the Cockneys are too old for such lullabies, they simply think he is gone distracted, or means to &#x201C;do&#x201D; them, and so having seen it once come no more back. Edward himself came here about a fortnight ago to tea, and I told him solemnly with a tone of friendly warning, such as he well merited from me, what I thought of that scandalous delusion; he was almost at crying, but remained&#x2014;as I expected him to remain. It sometimes appears to me, the <hi rend="italic">darkest</hi> fears are actually not groundless in regard to him. God deliver him!

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1831-10-30">30 Oct.</date></note> arrived here duly, and was received and read with the heartiest welcome; as by persons long shut out from all tidings, and <pb id="pg-06-54" n="06:54"/>greatly in want of such. I would have written sooner in answer, had there been anything practical to tell that seemed worth postage: but the old Newspaper every wednesday would indicate that we were &#x201C;in the old way,&#x201D; which is the main business of a Letter; and I still waited for franks, for more time &#x26;c &#x26;c and did not &#x2018;put pen to paper this night.&#x2019; It is an evil habit; do not you imitate me in it: the Letter of a Brother is always worth its postage, so long as one has money left. Today, however, there is an actual frank to Templand forthcoming (for Jeffrey who at present lives in the country, called this forenoon): so you will get this even cheaper. I suspend my Review scribbling,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On &#x201C;Characteristics.&#x201D;</note> for a far more pleasant kind; and send you a hasty word before going to sleep.</p>
<p>The Dairlaw Hills matter must, I think, be long ago decided: this makes me the more impatient to hear from you now. Had I been at your hand, I should not have known what to advise: except this that if desirable on the score of rent, or rather if <hi rend="italic">sufferable</hi> on that score, it was much to be desired for you on others. The neighbourhood to Scotsbrig, to all your friends connexions and acquaintances animate and inanimate: these are very great advantages, especially for a man of your turn; you would, in a word, be more in your <hi rend="italic">home</hi> there than in almost any other region. I long much to hear how it has gone; yet simply in hearing the <hi rend="italic">fact,</hi> shall not know whether to increase my anxieties for you or to diminish them. On the whole, I think I shall feel happy if you <hi rend="italic">go</hi> thither: I can then fancy you settled; and in a scene where your whole power of management, industry and prudent behaviour will have the freest scope; where your friends can hope with reason that you will be victorious rather than defeated. To avoid defeat is indeed all that one can look for in these times: victory and triumph is hardly appointed for any mortal. But on the whole, my Dear Brother, whether at Dairlaw Hills or in some other (if possible Annandale) farm, I think it every way desirable that you should soon be settled. Your late way of life has been trying for you in many ways: but now were you once set agoing there is a much fairer chance; you will be altogether free; and as a Husband and Father feel new obligation to do your best and wisest. Let us be of good courage: this ever remains true; <hi rend="italic">nothing but ourselves can finally beat us;</hi> it is not want of good Fortune, want of Happiness but want of wisdom that man has to dread. God keep us all, and guide us well! A toilsome stern life has been appointed the most of us; let us not falter or fall asleep by the way, but struggle forward be the road thorny or smooth.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-55" n="06:55"/>You must have grown very still and even dead at Craigenputtoch by this day of the year: often I fancy the sepulchral silence of the spot; it comes strangely into my thoughts in this soul-and-body-deafening tumult of the &#x2018;noble city.&#x2019; News we hope you have <hi rend="italic">none</hi> (for there <hi rend="italic">good</hi> news seldom arise); but that little Jane Welsh is still brisk and noisy, her Mother in motion and well; and you working, or profitably resting, and like &#x2018;a constitutional King&#x2019; nowise like a military despot, beneficiently ruling over both. By the way, I could not but sympathize with the little creature, in her looking at you with recognition, but &#x2018;evidently with fear.&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick had written: &#x201C;Little Jane Welsh is thriving capit<supplied>[al]</supplied>ly<supplied>[;]</supplied> she knows her mother going about the house already, and sometimes looks at me even tho&#x2019; never without fear evidently.&#x201D;</note> Poor little foreigner! this is a very strange country it has arrived in, and it knows not what devilry may be abroad, or who means kindly who unkindly. Be thankful for the mysterious little Present; and regard it as the message of God to you, and the pledge of new blessings and new duties.</p>
<p>We were a little surprised to hear of Betty&#x2019;s having made a new arrangement for the winter;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Smail, the maid, had been expected to remain at Craigenputtoch all winter.</note> Jane, I think, a little vexed: but on the whole it was perhaps best; at all events, if it was her own volition and choice there was no whispering any objection to it&#x2014; We will doubtless find some sort of Servant, better or worse, tho&#x2019; between terms, at our return. I wrote on the Newspaper a request that you would pay Betty her wages; which I daresay you have done or will do. I hope also you have settled with the Smith, in some way that satisfies your own convictions: Corrie&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander (Sandy) Corrie, a joiner from Newfield farm near Scotsbrig. Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280825-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:398</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-08-25">25 Aug. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> debt for the cart-shaft had been often in my head, and I am glad that you paid it. I remember also that I owed Hiddlestone some three shillings or so for raking the seed into the front green: if you have any opportunity, you might pay him: we will settle about all these matters when you produce your list of outlays in spring. Jane finally bids me mention that she directed Betty to raise [dig] the four beds of carrots, and send the produce of two of them over to Templand for Harry:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane&#x2019;s pony.</note> if Betty have not done this, will you &#x2018;take that trouble&#x2019; by your first convenience. This, I think, is all I have to remind you of about the Moorlands; from whose stern solitude I may now turn to more populous regions.</p>
<p>Jack, as you have doubtless heard, continues to progress and prosper. I sent two Letters from him forward to Scotsbrig; the last <pb id="pg-06-56" n="06:56"/>dated from Turin in the North of Italy: about this very time I expect he may be reading a Letter from me in safety at Florence, where he expected to make some more considerable stay. All seemed to be going well with him: his Patient tractable and amiable; his own health and spirits good; everyway a fair outlook. Let us pray that it may continue with him.</p>
<p>As for ourselves we are struggling on here without notable adventure of any kind. Our lodging and way of life continues quite passable; far better than one could hope; the only thing I complain of is want of room, I am sadly at a loss for a smoking place, having no resource for it but roasting myself over the fire in a close apartment, or retiring <hi rend="italic">out of a window,</hi> and there standing like &#x2018;a sign of the times&#x2019; on the top of a leaden cistern. After dark, I take the streets (which are very solitary, comparatively, in these quarters), or station myself on the balcony (a projection from the sill) of the front window, and there smoke contemplatively looking on the stars, which are the same Northern ones I used to see at Craigenputtoch. Jane has had a cold and been rather unwell for these ten days, but seems now recovering; otherwise our health is not to be complained of; neither does the &#x2018;Cholera Pestilence&#x2019; give us much terror: we will fly from it, if it come into our neighbourhood, and grow perilous; but otherwise, as I often say, &#x201C;what is the good of Fear? The whole solar system were it to fall together about our ears could kill us only <hi rend="italic">once</hi>.&#x201D;&#x2014; People are all quiet as yet; in great anxieties about their Reform Bill; and not unlikely, as I calculate, to get into some convulsions, one day, before all be done: but for the present there are no symptoms of it, neither is it I chiefly that need apprehend such a thing: so long as they leave <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the head standing on my shoulders, my main possessions in this world are left uninjured. God knows what will be the end of all this; the end will not be seen in our day.</p>
<p>Nothing has been done yet about the Book; except speaking a little from afar. However, the publishing season is now begun, and I mean soon to make a new trial. I shall still be disappointed, if I do not bring it home to you <hi rend="italic">printed:</hi> it will only be that I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not get a printer. Meanwhile, I am not altogether idle: we see plenty of people, and get some slight knowledge of their ways (tho&#x2019; this is very difficult to come at); we have been out visiting the Badamses, whom we found very kind and agreeable, Badams himself apparently in the way of rallying again, at all events much healthier; of the Montagues we see enough; of the Jeffreys less (for Jeffrey has been very unwell lately); Charles Buller is here sometimes; one Mill (writer of those Papers on <pb id="pg-06-57" n="06:57"/>the &#x201C;Spirit of the Age&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>) comes much about me; a youth named Glen (from Glasgow, a friend of Jack&#x2019;s): mostly <hi rend="italic">young</hi> men; for the old Author-class are utterly given up to the Devil, and no good can be got of them, or is in them. I still think of opening my closed lips to the people here one day; but find it will require courage, they are used to nothing of the sort. Perhaps my best plan will be to spend the summer in writing out my &#x2018;Notes&#x2019; at Puttoch, and then come hither next winter, and speak aloud in defiance of all men and things.&#x2014; For the present I am busy enough with a Paper (of no great length) for the Edinburgh Review; which straitens me greatly; my hand is quite out, and &#x201C;this is not my ain house,&#x201D; where I can work as I was wont, in any sense. However, after struggling and floundering enough, I am at last getting on; and hope to be thro&#x2019; in some three weeks. O that I were!&#x2014; Grahame of Burnswark came popping in, the other night: he has come hither about his American Patent business, which he seems to reckon prosperous: he lives within a few doors of us, and we shall likely see him often.&#x2014; Of Irving I have got little good for the last two months; have not had so much as a sight for these three weeks: he does not come hither, and to go to him, and find the &#x201C;Holy Ghost&#x201D; raging about him like Bedlam is no inviting journey. Poor Irving! I am in real anxiety about him: it is thought that he will soon lose his Church (the sane part of his people being quite shocked); and actually runs a risk himself of ending in the Madhouse! God prevent it! One is struck with a painful mixture of grief scorn and indignation to think of the end he seems hastening toward, and the company he has chosen.&#x2014; But now, dear Alick, I must draw bridle, for obvious reasons. Indeed, it is far in the night: I could not afford to wait till tomorrow, having a daily task to do, which of itself will perhaps excel my ability. So good night, my dear Brother! May nothing worse than poor little Jane Welsh Carlyle ever wake your sleep. Also do not like Selkirk forget to <hi rend="italic">Speak</hi>.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Selkirk, the lonely castaway.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am busy with an <hi rend="italic">Article</hi> intended for you, which I have entitled <hi rend="small-caps">Characteristics</hi>: it hooks itself to Hope&#x2019;s Book and Schlegel&#x2019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov.</date></ref></note> but has nothing essential do with either; Hope&#x2019;s could not be <hi rend="italic">reviewed</hi> except with peals of laughter mingled with groans, and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is now in his <hi rend="italic">grave;</hi> Schlegel&#x2019;s I left at Craigenputtoch, and cannot find a copy of here: so the Titles and some distant allusion are all I meddle with.</p>
<p>There are but six pages perfectly ready, the rest vague enough in my head; I am in the aphoristic style, and need an incessant watchfulness to keep from being abstruse. Tho&#x2019; I think, from twenty to twenty-five pages will hold what is to be said, I dare not confidently promise the Piece till about this day three weeks: <hi rend="italic">then</hi> however you may calculate on it,&#x2014;if you will leave me room. I do what in me lies; but am much interrupted here; all out of sorts; my <hi rend="italic">harness</hi> quite strange to me, therefore my <hi rend="italic">waygate</hi> [tail-race of a mill, i.e. progress] smaller. Nevertheless, I hope the thing may prove useful; above all, true, and then it cannot fail to be useful.</p>
<p>Mr Rees sent me a hint from you the other day; to which I returned what answer I had. It seems safer to inform yourself more distinctly how the matter stands. In <hi rend="italic">three weeks,</hi> then: sooner possibly, but not certainly.</p>
<p>All manner of perplexities have occurred in the publishing of my poor Book;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Sartor.</hi></note> which perplexities I could only cut asunder, not unloose: so the Ms like an unhappy Ghost still lingers on the wrong side of Styx; the Charon of Albemarle Street<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Murray.</note> durst not risk it in his <foreign><hi rend="italic">sutilis cymba</hi></foreign> [stitched-together boat];<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi> VI, 414&#x2013;5.</note> so it leaped ashore again.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I received your Letter yesterday, with great pleasure to hear that all was well in Dumfriesshire. Let us not, in the midst of our crosses and losses, which we sometimes reckon vexatious enough, forget to be thankful for this great blessing. While so many kind friends are mercifully spared us, why should we think that the world is quite a stranger land to us, that we are homeless wayfarers there? If wayfarers and strangers, as all men are, we have at least fellow-pilgrims to cheer us by the road, such as all men have not. We hope also that we have a Guide in Heaven; to whom be all gratitude for His Goodness; to whose arrangements let us with all humility submit ourselves!</p>
<p>Had not you specially desired it, I should scarcely have written at present: for I am much hurried, beaten about and everyway stinted of utterance; and as for advising, almost all the light I can give you has already been more than once emitted. However, I know you will expect this Letter on Wednesday; so I take time by the right side; and without prejudice to my tomorrow&#x2019;s task, will not wholly disappoint you. A word of encouragement, and brotherly Good-speed shall not be wanting.</p>
<p>First then as to that farm of Catlinns,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311220-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-12-20">20 Dec.</date></ref></note> we are so far happy to hear that you have fixed upon something; and have now an outlook upon which you can considerately direct your efforts. I hope the place is taken at something like a reasonable rent, one at least that your best judgement considers promising: for that is all the length one can go, especially in a time like this. From the circumstance that the Clows<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The family of Alexander&#x2019;s wife.</note> are willing to embark with you, or altogether relieve you of the enterprise, I infer that such is actually the case. Of the situation of the Farm I have formed to myself some notion; it seems to be at a fit enough distance from our &#x201C;Native,&#x201D; and in a desireable enough kind of country: pretty well therefore on that side. William Grahame knows the Farm by sight, and calls it a &#x201C;coldish kind of farm&#x201D;; but can give me no idea of the grand question whether at the rent it is cheap or dear. For the rest, I am assured that you will do your very utmost <pb id="pg-06-60" n="06:60"/>in it; and have insight enough to find out by rigorous consideration what is the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> method of procedure, and energy enough to put it diligently in practice. To it, then, with heart and hand! &#x201C;Lay aside every weight&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 12:1.</note> for the life-race you have got to run: this is properly the beginning of your separate life; resolve that wherein you have mistaken you will mistake no more, that wherein you have done right, you will do doubly so. Barren as the world is, my dear Brother, I do not think that you are specially the man to fail first in it. Nay, who knows but by and by the weary time may mend, and so your journey become a little easier. At all events, fear nothing; trust in the Higher Guidance, and walk so as to deserve it. And so God be with you, and prosper you in this and every honest enterprise; that, fortunate or not, you may grow to be <hi rend="italic">a good man,</hi> and the pilgrimage thro&#x2019; this shadow-land of Time lead you well into the country of Eternity: for it is to God that the one as well as the other belongs!&#x2014; However, I am getting too serious; and must speak a little of matters temporal, tho&#x2019; the night is Sunday&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>With regard to that <hi rend="italic">Money,</hi> then, about which you so vex yourself, let me beg of you once for all to consider it, what it was from the first, as a thing finally settled, and on which nothing more is to be said. The half of the sum you have, or the whole of it, or twice as much, would do nothing permanent for me; and to you it is of importance, as a beginning of Life: therefore, my dear Brother, let me hear nothing more of it; but set yourself agoing with it, and suffer me to enjoy peaceably the small comfort that here for once I have contributed to do my Brother a little good. We will settle up all little matters in Spring; then mark the amount on some paper document, and so have finally done with it. This I must entreat you as a favour not to let me hear of again.&#x2014; The second thing to be considered, that of your entering into Partnership with Robert Clow<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cousin of Janet, Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s wife. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300629-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-06-29">29 June 1830</date></ref>.</note> will therefore of itself fall to the ground. I hope, you have capital enough of your own to stock the Farm with, and begin it fairly; in which I am clear that an independent footing is the best. Robert Clow is a kind of man with whom it were good to have dealings, rather than with most others, a well-doing, prudent and honest man: nevertheless, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Partnerships I think are to be avoided, as the source of discrepancy, and things that seldom or never go smoothly on. Robert will answer excellently well, if he be so disposed, as your ploughman with fixed wages for his labour: but my advice is that in all respects you be your own master, and independent manager, and walk forward on your own <pb id="pg-06-61" n="06:61"/>legs, or you will never walk comfortably at all.&#x2014; The third point, that of giving up Catlinns, and taking a smaller farm, will also, I hope, now be of itself settled. That is to say, supposing you have capital enough for your present enterprise, and think it of tolerable promise, why should you look out for another? If indeed you have not capital enough, or otherwise see that you could get a more favourable spot, then of course try for it: but this I calculate will hardly be your case. For my own share, having nothing but the vaguest conjecture to go upon, it were absurd to offer any opinion here. I should somehow have figured you as <hi rend="italic">more at home,</hi> had your lot been cast in Dairlaw Hills, or Stennybeck,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stonyebeck: &#xBD; mile north of Scotsbrig.</note> or any of those <hi rend="italic">innerly,</hi> known situations: but this is a mere sentimentalism of mine, and worthy of no regard. Let me hope therefore my dear Alick that you see your way a little now; and discover that you have got into no ill-starred plight, but are about to commence progress quite under natural and hopeful circumstances. Set a brave heart to it, enter upon it with a thoughtful serious Confidence; and so as the Spaniards say, &#x201C;go with God&#x201D;! I think happier days are beginning for you: at all events, never quit that first of all faiths that if a man be true to himself, nothing <hi rend="italic">can</hi> finally overpower him. There is properly no other loss in this world, but the loss of our wits; which indeed overtakes not a few: God grant that we be not of the number! All else shall be welcome.</p>
<p>I have little to tell you of myself; but that little happily not evil. I am but in a <foreign><hi rend="italic">dwamish</hi></foreign> [faint], weakly way here (so far as <hi rend="italic">spiritual</hi> health goes), quite out of sorts for writing; and have had a most miserable <foreign><hi rend="italic">feckless</hi></foreign> [spiritless] kind of struggle to get under way with writing. People come in upon me, and all that; then I have no privacy, as I was wont at Puttoch, there to <hi rend="italic">lash</hi> myself into a heat: here I must even hobble along spavined as I am. However I persevere, thro&#x2019; good weather and thro&#x2019; bad. The thing I am writing is a sort of second <hi rend="italic">Signs of the Times;</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Characteristics.&#x201D;</note> I expect it will perhaps be in the next Number of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh:</hi> and I hope to have done with it, this day two weeks, when one gladdish man there will be in this city. I shall meddle with nothing more till I have a better <hi rend="italic">workshop</hi>. As to Lecturing, the encouragement is small I find; and nothing could be prudently ventured in that way as yet: none but quacks have ever been known to lecture here; so the whole thing has an unpromising aspect to all I speak of it with. In other respects my outlooks are exactly what they were: into Vacuity, into Nothingness. However, I am not without some Faith; some Faith in myself (be God ever <pb id="pg-06-62" n="06:62"/>thanked for it!); neither does it seem as if this world could be quite dead for me, but I had a thing or two to do there. I believe I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> speak too; and shall perhaps one day actually try it; but not till I see what the meaning of it is.&#x2014; I am again among the Booksellers with my Manuscript: but have yet got nothing fixed; not even my first <hi rend="italic">refusal</hi>. You shall hear about it when anything occurs. These are ungainly times; and must be worse, for the like of me, before they can be better. Forward! Forward! Not the quantity of Pleasure we have had, but the quantity of Victory we have gained, of Labour we have overcome: that is the happiness of Life. Let us on, then, in God&#x2019;s name!&#x2014; I am close on the end of my sheet, dear Brother, and had innumerable things to say. Would I had a frank; but there is none within my reach.&#x2014; Jane has not been very strong, with colds and what not; but is now better; and ever assiduous, clear and faithful, a very precious little Wifie; any other woman might have gone mad beside me. She likes London, and all my bits of friends, tho some of them are not of the greatest sort of characters; and this City, especially in these months, is damp, raw-frosty and <foreign>reeky</foreign> beyond measure. Your very nostrils are filled with <hi rend="italic">soot</hi>.&#x2014; Give our truest wishes to Jenny; be glad and thankful and cheerful towards the little Stranger; and all good and happy!</p>
<closer><salute>Ever your affectionate Brother /</salute></closer>

<ps><p>Irving has not come near me this month, and I dare not visit his home which is more a Bedlam than a home. He is raging away, and not out of danger, as we evidently see, of landing in the strait waistcoat. God forbid it; turn it otherwise! You will see in the Newspaper by and by that his Congregation are splitting on the point; and it is calculated that in a short time he will be turned <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of his Church: this is hardly doubtful. What next is to follow? Unless new <hi rend="italic">light</hi> be given him: Field preaching &#x26;c &#x26;c will follow; and then&#x2014;</p>
<p>You did well to send word to Scotsbrig: do not neglect it on this occasion either. Say that we are looking for a Letter thence; anxious to hear; that nevertheless I will write again, if anything occur.</p>
<p>Some wretches are &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">burking</hi>&#x201D; poor stragglers here: three miscreants are to be hanged for that crime tomorrow-morning.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov.</date></ref> The convicted men were James May, John Williams, and John Bishop.

<salute>My Dear Father,</salute>
<p>I have long proposed to myself the pleasure of writing you a Letter; and must now do it much more hurriedly than I could have wished. I did not mean to undertake it all till next week; for at present I am engaged every moment <hi rend="italic">against Time,</hi> finishing an Article for the Edinburgh Review, and can expect no respite till after Saturday night: however, our Lord Advocate having called today, and furnished me with a frank to carry Jack&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi> Epistle, I embrace the opportunity, lest none so good occur afterwards. Half of my day&#x2019;s task is done; the good wife is even now making the tea: so I will scribble you a few lines, and try to make up my leeway before bedtime.</p>
<p>Alick informed me in general about ten days ago that you were &#x201C;all well&#x201D;; in the last Newspaper stood a word from Jane that she &#x201C;would write soon&#x201D;: I can only pray that she would do so; and hope in the mean time that she may have no worse news to tell me. This weather is very unhealthy, the worst of the whole year; I often think how my Mother and you are getting on under it. I hope, at least, you <hi rend="italic">take every care,</hi> and do not needlessly or needfully expose yourself: it is bad policy to brave the weather, especially for you, at this season. I pray you, keep much within doors; beware of Cold especially of damp feet: a cup of tea, night and morning, I should also think a good preventive. But perhaps Jane will still be able to <pb id="pg-06-64" n="06:64"/>inform me that &#x201C;all is well&#x201D;; one of the blessings I ought to be most thankful for, as it is among the most precious for me.</p>
<p>We are struggling forward here, as well as we can. My health is not worse than it was wont to be; I think I am even clearer and fresher than when you saw me last. Jane has been complaining somewhat; but is not regularly <hi rend="italic">sick:</hi> her cold has left her, and now she has a little occasional cough, with weakliness; the like of which is very prevalent here at present. George Irving has been attempting to prescribe for her; she even let him draw a little blood: I rather think, however, that her faith in Physicians is somewhat on a level with my own; that she will give them no more of her blood; but trust to exercise, diet, and the return of settled weather.</p>
<p>I cannot get on with the publishing of my Book; nobody will so much as <hi rend="italic">look</hi> at a thing of the sort, till this Reform Business be done. Nay, I begin to doubt whether I shall at all during this present posture of affairs, get my Speculation put into print. There is only a limited time that I will consent to wait looking after it; if they <hi rend="italic">do not</hi> want it, why then let them leave it alone. <hi rend="italic">Either</hi> way will do for me; I only want to know which. Meanwhile I am making what little attempts about it seem prudent: if I altogether fail here, I may still have Edinburgh to try in. One way or other, I wish to be at the end of it, and will be so.&#x2014; Our Advocate, who is now quite recovered again, and as brisk as a bee would fain do something useful for me, find me some Place or other that would keep me here: I know he has spoken of me to Chancellors and Secretarys of State, and would take all manner of pains: nevertheless I compute simply that the result of it all will be Nothing; and I still look back to my whinstone fortress among the mountains as the stronghold wherefrom I am to defy the world. I have applications enough for writing, some of them new since I came hither: so long as I can wag the pen, there is no fear of me. I also incline to think that something might and perhaps should be done by such as me in the way of Lecturing: but not at this time, not under these circumstances. We will wait; and if so seem good, try it again. On the whole I always return to this: As the great Guide orders, so be it! While I can say <hi rend="italic">His will be mine,</hi> there is no power in Earth or out of it that can put me to fear.</p>
<p>I could describe our way of Life here, which is very simple, had I room. Plenty of people come about us; we go little out to anything like parties, never to dinners; or anywhere willingly except for <hi rend="italic">profit</hi>. I transact sometimes immense quantities of <hi rend="italic">talk;</hi> indeed often talk more than I listen,&#x2014;which Course I think of altering. It is and continues <pb id="pg-06-65" n="06:65"/>a wild wondrous chaotic den of Discords this London: I am often <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> [deeply sad] and awestruck at once to wander along its crowded streets, and see and hear the roaring torrent of men and animals and carriages and waggons,&#x2014;all rushing they know not whence, they know not whither! Nevertheless there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a deep, divine meaning in it; and God is in the midst of it, had we but eyes to see.&#x2014; Towards two o&#x2019;clock I am about laying down my pen; to walk till as near dinner (at four) as I like: then comes usually resting stretched on the sofa, with such small talk as may be going till tea; after which, unless some interloper drop in (as happens fully oftener than not) I again open my desk, and work till bedtime about eleven. I have had a tough struggle indeed with this Paper; but my hand is now <hi rend="italic">in</hi> again, and I am doing better.&#x2014; Charles Buller comes now and then about us; a fine honest fellow, among the best we see. There is also one Glen (a young <hi rend="italic">unhewed</hi> philosopher, a friend of Jack&#x2019;s), and one Mill, a young <hi rend="italic">hewed</hi> philosopher and partial disciple of mine: both great favourites here. W. Grahame of Burnswark was in our neighbourhood for three weeks; and will be arriving in Glasgow again about this very night, unless he have struck in by Ecclefechan and home. He is busy with some American patents and so forth; from which he is sure of a salary for one year, but I think scarcely of anything more. The American Consulship, of which he hoped much, has gone another road. He is fresh and healthy, and I hope will fall in with something.&#x2014; Irving does not come much here; only once since that gift-of-tongue work began, and we have not been even once with <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. It was last week that he called. He looked hollow and haggard; thin, greywhiskered, almost an old man: yet he was composed and affectionate and patient: I could almost have wept over him, and did tell him my mind with all plainness. It seems likely they will take his Church from him, and then difficulties of all sorts may multiply on him: but I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> think he will altogether lose his wits, at least not so as to land in Bedlam; and perhaps he may yet see his way thro&#x2019; all this, and leave it all behind him. God grant it be so!&#x2014; I have hardly another scrap of room here: I must scrawl my Mother a line; and then bid you all goodnight. <closer><salute>I remain always (My dear Fathe<supplied>[r) Your]</supplied> Affectionate Son&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have, barely within my time, <supplied>[finished]</supplied> that Paper;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Characteristics,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> LIV (<date when="1831-12-00">Dec. 1831</date>), 351&#x2013;83. Carlyle had promised to have the article ready three weeks from <date when="1831-11-26">26 Nov.</date>, the date of his last letter to Napier.</note> to which you are now heartily welcome, if you have room for it.</p>
<p>The Doctrines here set forth have mostly long been familiar convictions with me; yet it is perhaps only within the last twelvemonth that the public utterance of some of them could have seemed a duty. I have striven to express myself with what guardedness was possible: and, as there will now be no time for correcting Proofs, I must leave it wholly in your Editorial hands. Please to keep the <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi> for me; and <hi rend="italic">three Copies</hi> of the printed Paper.</p>
<p>Nay, should it on due consideration appear to you in your place (for I see that matter dimly, and nothing is clear but my own mind and the general condition of the world) unadviseable to print the Paper at all, then pray understand, my dear Sir, now and always, that I am no unreasonable man; but if dogmatic enough (as Jeffrey used to call it) in my own beliefs, also truly desirous to be just towards those of others. I shall, in all sincerity, beg of you to do, without fear of offence (for in <hi rend="italic">no</hi> point <supplied>[indeed]</supplied> will there be any), what you yourself see good.</p>
<p><supplied>[A]</supplied> mighty work lies before the writers of this time. I have a great faith and a great hope that the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> will not be wanting on its part, but stand forth in the van, where it has some right to be.</p>
<p>But we shall get to understand these things better, and much else; for I hope to see you soon, and ask and answer to great lengths. We purpose coming home by Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, perhaps in two mo<supplied>[n]</supplied>ths, perhaps much sooner.</p>
<p>The Book-trade is still dead, or in a state of suspended animation. The aspect of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> world fills me with shuddering admiration.&#x2014; I rather think I must even stick my own little Book<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Sartor.</hi></note> in my pocket again, after all.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-67" n="06:67"/>I have various other things <foreign><hi rend="italic">in posse</hi></foreign> to write for you; but shall forbear speaking of them till it can be done with readier organs than these.</p>
<p>The Reform Bill sails with fair wind and full sea. May the Heavens grant but this one prayer: That we had done with it!</p>
<p><closer><salute>I hope soon to hear of you; and am always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>We received your Letter bearing the eternal &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Roma</hi>&#x201D; stamped on the back of it<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1831-11-26">26 Nov.</date> with a postmark of <date when="1831-12-12">DEC 12 / 1831</date> on it. John wrote: &#x201C;The reason of our coming to Rome instead of Florence was that Lady Clare&#x2019;s brother had been forced to leave Florence for his health &#x26; purposed to spend the winter here. It was thought useless to go out of our way to Florence since we could not well have staid longer than a week there, &#x26; therefore should have had no comfort &#x26; seen next to nothing in our unrest to finish the journey before winter. We are to be here for at least two months longer &#x26; most likely till the end of <date when="1832-02-00">February</date>. The first week we occupied the appartments which the Duchess de Berri had just left the day we arrived, and now we have got a still more splendid suite where we are to remain for good. The house we live in is called the Hotel de l&#x2019;Europe but is quite different from any thing of the kind in England. It is the best here &#x26; has rooms more like those of a palace than an inn. There are none but English in it as far as I can see, &#x26; the whole of the <hi rend="italic">Piazza di Spagna</hi> where it stands seems to be the fashionable resort of the English. One may get on in it quite well without knowing any other language. &#x2026; My patient is much better than when we left England; but she owes much more to the interest of the new scenes we see than to any medicines. I have relieved her twice or thrice from the most violent headache. &#x2026; I hope Jane is still well, &#x26; free from her old enemy. Tell her to be sure &#x26; add a little postscript next letter. There is something really sublime in your present position in the Babylonish city, with no resources but true hearts bound together &#x26; fearless devotion to the Good through whatever perils. There is a time coming when you will have to stand forward for the age is dark &#x26; wants earnest guidance. &#x2026;&#x201D;</note> exactly eight days ago; and I can now with all deliberation address myself to the welcome task of answering. The name &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Roma,</hi>&#x201D; to see it standing as a still living word, looked strange to me; more especially that you should be on the strange spot it indicates: <pb id="pg-06-68" n="06:68"/>however, all places in this world are wonderful, and the world itself and we in the middle thereof are fearful and wonderful. No doubt my Letter, almost instantaneously on receipt of your Turino one despatched to Florence, is long ago in your hands: it is pity that your Posts should be so ineffectual; and a reason for our making fresh exertion to do the best with them: I will very cheerfully write every three weeks,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had suggested this in his letter.</note> if such turn out to appear the preferable method; at the same time, as there is always something perplexing in <hi rend="italic">cross purposes,</hi> I think it were better to see first <hi rend="italic">how</hi> long a Letter actually takes to travel, and see whether we cannot by waiting a few days more secure the pleasure not of a Letter only but of an <hi rend="italic">Answer</hi>. I will not wait <hi rend="italic">much</hi> longer, however; and at all events, write instantaneously when your Letter comes to hand: of that you may feel quite certain.&#x2014; It was very gratifying to us to learn that all went tolerably well with you, both as Person and as Doctor: continue to <hi rend="italic">wish honestly</hi> with your whole heart to act rightly, and you will not go far wrong: no other advice is needed or can be given. Also for your own behoof, continue to keep your eyes open, both on men and things; much valuable insight lies within reach of you. I have never despaired and now I feel more and more certain of one day seeing you <hi rend="italic">a Man;</hi> this too in a time like ours, when such a result is of all others the hardest to realize. One has to learn the hard lesson of <hi rend="italic">Martyrdom,</hi> and that he has arrived in this Earth not to <hi rend="italic">receive</hi> but to <hi rend="italic">give:</hi> let him be ready then &#x201C;to spend and be spent&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 Cor. 12:15.</note> for the God&#x2019;s cause; let him, as he needs must, &#x201C;set his face like a flint&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isa. 50:7.</note> against <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Dishonesty and Indolence and Puffery and Quackery and Malice and Delusion, whereof Earth is full; and once for all flatly refuse to do the Devil&#x2019;s work in this which is God&#x2019;s Earth, let the issue be simply what it may. &#x201C;I must live, Sir,&#x201D; cry many; to which I answer: &#x201C;No, Sir; you need <hi rend="italic">not</hi> live: if your Body cannot be kept together without selling your Soul, then let the Body fall asunder and the Soul be unsold.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;All true, Mr Carlyle; <hi rend="small-caps">but</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; Unhappy Cowards and Dotards! The word were: &#x201C;All true, Mr Carlyle; <hi rend="small-caps">and</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;. In brief, Jack, defy the Devil in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> his figures, and spit upon him; he cannot hurt you. I meant to add that your last Letter, tho&#x2019; evidently of the hurried sort, was very interesting; remember always that in <hi rend="italic">men</hi> only do men take interest; chiefly in men dear to them. Go on carefully and copiously with your Journal: if you really gather any <hi rend="italic">light</hi> about foreign things, it may one day be very <pb id="pg-06-69" n="06:69"/>welcome here, as surely it will be highly useful. Our Travel-books are mostly the Duds of Duds.</p>
<p>I have had a Letter from Alick, and yesterday one from Will Brown; and three days before one from Sister Jean at Scotsbrig: all well enough everywhere. Wull Brown, poor slut, writes about some farm he is nigh mad with offering for and getting no answer; he requests me to interfere; so I have this moment finished a Note on his behalf to a certain M.P. here, in whose hands hang the scales of his destiny&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">eet-a</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Will Brown, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311221-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1831-12-21">21 Dec.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311225-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1831-12-25">25 Dec.</date></ref></note> Alick has actually got a Farm; a place called <hi rend="italic">Catlinns</hi> (near Corrielaw and Sloder Hill in his native region), for which he is to pay &#xa3;140 yearly: it is thought to be a tolerable and tolerably taken place; and he is proceeding with all spirit. The Clowes had offered to run shares with him: but I dissuaded all <hi rend="italic">copartneries,</hi> as he had capital enough himself. He is said to be very fond of his child; he &#x201C;had been making himself miserable,&#x201D; he tells me, &#x201C;about you and your Alps&#x201D; in some snow-storm they had, early in <date when="1831-11-00">November.</date> I suppose (this very day),<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle writes &#x201C;tomorrow&#x201D; above the parentheses.</note> at all events, next Wednesday, he may be reading your Letter; for I despatched in some 48 hours, having the opportunity of a frank; and it must have met Jean&#x2019;s Letter on the road. From this last, which is an excellent piece throughout, I quote one sentence, exactly as it stands: &#x201C;Our Mother has been healthier than usual this winter; but &#x2018;terribly <foreign>hadden</foreign> [held] down wi&#x2019; anxiety&#x2019;: she told me the other day &#x2018;the first <foreign>geat</foreign> [way] she <foreign>gaed</foreign> every morning was to London, then to Italy, then to Craigenputtoch, and then into Mary&#x2019;s, and finally began to think them at Hame were maybe no safer than the rest.&#x2019; When I asked her what she wished me to say to you, she said she had a thousand things to say if she had you here, &#x2018;and thou may tell them, I&#x2019;m very little fre&#x2019; them.&#x2019; You are to pray for us all daily while separated from one another, &#x2018;that our ways be in God&#x2019;s keeping.&#x2019; You are also to tell the Dr when you write, with her love, that he is to read his Bible carefully, and not to forget that God sees him in whatever land he may be.&#x201D;&#x2014; Our Father (to whom I wrote copiously by last frank) had been suffering a little with cold; but was now better: all other persons and interests were in the safe usual way. Let the great Giver of Good be thanked for it!</p>
<p>I must dilate somewhat on our own concerns &#x2018;in this noble city&#x2019;: and to these, as you get the Times and Galignani,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov.</date></ref></note> I shall chiefly restrict myself. Jane is unfortunately not in the best health; always sickly <pb id="pg-06-70" n="06:70"/>a little, perhaps in part owing to our miserable soft-winter weather: she is now lying opposite me on the sofa, sewing; better than she has been, and in good heart; true to me, and to the right, even to the utmost; as a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> wife ought to be. George Irving, whom we discover to be a mixture of goose and weathercock, has been drawing blood from her; but, she declares, shall no longer practice his <hi rend="italic">Ne</hi>science on such a subject. He <hi rend="italic">has</hi> at length parted with Agnes, and the <hi rend="italic">Tuckerean</hi> feud no longer distresses the world; George himself now &#x201C;wearing his seven keys on himself.&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly an account of the end of Irving&#x2019;s troubles with a housekeeper.</note> An honourable, ardent kind of creature; out of whom however <foreign><hi rend="italic">wird nichts</hi></foreign> [nothing will come]. Jane I think is recovering, and even now in a tolerable state. For myself I have had such a bout as man never had, at least I never: in getting myself <foreign><hi rend="italic">stiddered</hi></foreign> [steadied, stabilized] here, and actually finishing a kind of Paper for Macvey on <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Schlegel;</hi> or rather on the subject they handled; for neither of the Books were beside me, and they occupy no more than two paragraphs out of some 30 pages. I called the thing <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Characteristics&#x201D;;</hi> and despatched it, according to engagement (with utmost difficulty) by the Saturday Mail Coach: whether Napier will have it or not is uncertain to me; but <hi rend="italic">no matter,</hi> or only a secondary one, for the thing has some truth in it, and could find vent elsewhere. If I can find any opportunity (which seems doubtful, for I think there is no Envoy at Rome) I will send you a copy of it; which in any case you will see by and by. It is Teufelsdreckish; and preaches from this text: &#x2018;The healthy know not of their health, but only the sick.&#x2019;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Characteristics&#x201D; begins with these words. Carlyle says that they are &#x201C;the Physician&#x2019;s Aphorism.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; As to <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck</hi> himself, hope has not yet arisen for him; nay rather certainty begins to show itself that he has no hope. Lately I took some earnest counsel with Black on the matter; was by him recommended to one Tilt<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Tilt (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>), publisher, who was at 86 Fleet St. from <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date> to <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, in partnership with David Bogue from <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> to <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> at the same address.</note> of Fleet-street, &#x2018;as the publishing season had begun better than was expected.&#x2019; Tilt got sight of the Book; and as I from the first could have sworn he would, returned it with compliments. I have now given it to Dilke (Cunningham&#x2019;s Athenaeum Dilke,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Wentworth Dilke. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310822-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-22">22 Aug.</date></ref></note> an honest kind of creature) to look over and see what he advises: if he advise <hi rend="italic">nothing,</hi> I see not that there is anything farther to be attempted here, but tie the Papers up again and take them home. <foreign><hi rend="italic">A la bonne heure!</hi></foreign> [Well and good!] I have also <pb id="pg-06-71" n="06:71"/>written to Tait, who was applying to me, on other grounds, as you shall hear. We shall do what we can. Glen read the <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. &#x2018;with infinite satisfaction&#x2019;; John Mill with fears that &#x2018;the world would take some time to see what meaning was in it&#x2019;: &#x2018;perhaps all Eternity,&#x2019; I answered. For the rest, we have partially made up our minds here; and see the course we have to follow. Preferment there is none to be looked for; living here by Literature is either serving the Devil, or fighting against him at fearful odds; in Lecturing it is also quite clear there could no profitable audience be had as yet when every Lecturer is by nature a quack and tinkling cymbal: so what will remain but to thank God that our whinstone castle is still standing among the mountains; and return thither to work there, till we can make a new sally? We calculate on going round by Edinburgh, where some relations are perhaps to be cleared up or entered upon and then home to meditate on the many wonders we have seen, and consider <hi rend="italic">what</hi> lies in them. God be thanked neither my Wife nor I [torn] or capable of being staggered by any fortune that the world can proffer. &#x2018;From the bosom of Eternity shine for us radiant guiding stars.&#x2019;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> Nay our task is essentially high and glorious and happy: God only give us strength to do it well!&#x2014; Meanwhile offers in the literary Periodical way come thick enough. Three or four weeks ago Procter wrote to me that E. L. Bulwer<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Edward Bulwer. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310120-TC-MN-01">TC to MN, <date when="1831-01-20">20 Jan.</date></ref></note> had &#x2018;some disposition&#x2019; to employ me in the New Monthly Magazine, of which he is Editor; and that it &#x2018;would be adviseable for me to call on him&#x2019;: to which proposal, of course, there could be no answer except mild silence <foreign><hi rend="italic">der Inbegriff aller Harmonieen</hi></foreign> [the essence of all harmonies]. Whereupon in ten days more, the Mystagogue of the Dandiacal Body wrote to me a most bland and euphuistically-flattering Note, soliciting an interview as my &#x2018;admirer.&#x2019; I answered that for some days I was too busy to call; but would when I had leisure,&#x2014;as I yesterday did; and found him from home. I have also looked into his Magazine (since it came to him, two Months ago) and find it polished, sharp and barren; yet not <hi rend="italic">al</hi>together how <supplied>[empty]</supplied>: the work as of Gigmen, or rather Gig-<hi rend="italic">boys,</hi> and Whig-boys, <hi rend="italic">aiming</hi> blindly enough towards something higher: <foreign><hi rend="italic">O</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">A</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">hndungen einer bessern Zeit</hi></foreign> [premonitions of a better time]. My business being to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> all men, I will in time look towards the &#x2018;Inspired Penman&#x2019; once more, and ascertain better what his relation to me really is: I have <hi rend="italic">Articles</hi> in my head; but if Naso<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Napier.</note> behave himself he shall have the pick of 
<pb id="pg-06-72" n="06:72"/>them. Some months ago (besides all this) Tom Holcroft got somebody to join him in purchasing the Old &#x2018;Monthly,&#x2019; which he is zealously recruiting for: I gave him a scrap of some Translation from Goethe, the Proof-slips of which have arrived within this very half hour.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This was &#x201C;Goethe&#x2019;s Visit to Beireis [From Goethe&#x2019;s Autobiography],&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">The Monthly Magazine or British Register,</hi> new series, XIII (<date when="1832-01-00">Jan. 1832</date>), 57&#x2013;67, which ends with a comment by Carlyle himself on Hofrath Beireis, as a &#x201C;Philosopher-quack,&#x201D; of which &#x201C;we have seen specimens in England.&#x201D; This translation and comment by Carlyle is not elsewhere recorded.</note> Then again James Fraser, whom I called on yesterday to demand my &#x2018;Goither Schiller &#x26; Mad: de Stael&#x2019;<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Schiller, Goethe, and Madame de Sta&#xEB;l,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine,</hi> V (<date when="1832-03-00">March 1832</date>), 171&#x2013;76.</note> back from him, expresses great earnestness that I would write, and offers me 15 guineas a sheet, and actually sends over this &#x2018;Croker&#x2019;s Boswell&#x2019; at my heels.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;Boswell&#x2019;s Life of Johnson,&#x201D; a review of John Wilson Croker&#x2019;s edition, appeared in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine,</hi> V (<date when="1832-05-00">May 1832</date>), 379&#x2013;413.</note> Last and greatest, Tait of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (as I hinted) says that he is just starting, or thinking to do it, a radical or mystico-radical Magazine, and earnestly desires &#x26;c &#x26;c I myself have been studying as you partly know, whether a mystico-radical school could not be brought together here, and a Publication begun as their organ: I write to Tait in some measure to that effect; and think probably for the present he will&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">do nothing. <foreign>Die Zeit bringt Rosen</foreign></hi> [Time brings roses].&#x2014; Thus you see, boy, there is abundance of work, and I, as was said, am in working tune.&#x2014; For the rest, I continue to see plenty of people: the Bullers are all here (except Arthur) but I have yet seen only Charles (for it is but two days that the old people are near us) and like him well.

Arbuckle whom we like much and hope well of, has been out looking at Banbury &#x26; Alesbury; is very cheerful since, and will certainly settle in one or the other of these towns (with his Brother) in a few days. Jane is for knitting him a purse: he inquires after you with an air of real affection. W.

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Having an opportunity, as Jane is writing to Mrs Richardson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. <sic>Caroline</sic><corr>Catherine E.</corr> Richardson, the novelist, see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280326-TC-JWC-01"><sic>4:345</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1828-03-26">26 March 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> under a frank, I will steal a minute or two, and send you my greeting. I have received a letter from Jane of Scotsbrig, wherein among other news I hear that you are busy with your Catlinns speculation; actually preparing to break ground there. To it with all might! Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, see thou do it quickly.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 9:10.</note>&#x2014; She told me also that you were all well; which I hope and trust still continues true.</p>
<p>In return I will now tell you (what perhaps you have heard already) that a Letter has come from Jack, and must be a week ago at Scotsbrig. He is in the once Capital of the World, in Rome itself: quite well to appearance; and every way getting on well. Many inquiries he makes about you among others; all which I strove yesterday to answer in the longest and closest Letter my hurry would permit me to write.</p>
<p>For ourselves, I am sorry the accounts are not wholly so pleasant: in this one respect chiefly that my dear little Wife does not seem to take with London; but continues still weakly, tho&#x2019; not in bed, yet some days (as this) in her room. However, I reckon her now to be getting stouter again; and hope next Letter to tell you that all is well. Nay, at worst, I believe nothing else but a sickly turn could be expected after the toil and uproar she underwent in getting ready for her departure from Scotland.</p>
<p>I myself am in my usual state of health and heart, or in the latter respect rather better than usual. The world&#x2019;s mad whirl does not confuse me; nor its midnight darkness blind me: daily and hourly I say to myself in respect of it: Go thou thy way, and I will go mine.&#x2014; I have finished a strange Article for the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review; tho&#x2019; whether Napier dare print it or not, is still uncertain to me. We shall soon see: I wish he may for several reasons; he shall then have more of the like, and both the world and I may be the better for them.&#x2014; There is still not the faintest outlook for <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck,</hi> more especially till the Reform Bill get out of the way: indeed Literature, like all earthly <pb id="pg-06-75" n="06:75"/>things seems to have got into a state in which it <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> continue; either it must improve, or altogether disappear from the world. Meanwhile, one had need to be wary, for the road is stony enough, dark enough. However, for the present I have quite a choice of work, quite a superabundance: no fewer than I think <hi rend="italic">four</hi> new applications have been made me within the last ten days. They are mostly of the Dud sort, it is true; yet the offer made respectfully, the wages tolerable: on the whole, the best outlook one c<supplied>[an]</supplied> count on in these circumstances. On the whole, let us fear nothing, so long as we are wise. Do thou <supplied>[work]</supplied> diligently, Boy; let me do the like; each in his <supplied>[way, ho]</supplied>w disheartening soever: above all let us think ever that God&#x2019;s eye is upon us, to pity, to help us. This is the everlasting Truth; tho&#x2019; so many forget it and deny it.</p>
<p>Wull Brown writes me a most confused Letter abou<supplied>[t]</supplied> &#x2018;Masterton Ure Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2019; and &#x2018;East Linbrigford&#x2019; and his woes <supplied>[and]</supplied> cares: I have actually sent a Note over to Masterton Ure,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311220-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-12-20">20 Dec.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311225-TC-MAC-01">next letter</ref>. Masterton Ure (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>) was educated at Glasgow University; Writer to the Signet, <date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>; M.P. for Weymouth, <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">32</date>.</note> and if I get any answer, will very speedily communicate it to poor Wull. My own idea is that the &#x2018;lease business&#x2019; is not yet completed; and that Wull by his eating anxiety has eaten himself into an astonishment at &#x2018;hearing nothing,&#x2019;&#x2014;where there was no room for astonishment. Poor fellow!&#x2014; If you have any opportunity send my kind thanks to Jean for her Letter, which both of us here thought excellent in itself and still more so to us; also tell her that I will <hi rend="italic">not long</hi> delay answering it, and <hi rend="italic">her</hi>.</p>
<p>My Goody, who lies on the sofa <supplied>[here]</supplied> by me, sends her love to you and your household from her Namesake upwards. Take a sheet, and write me soon <hi rend="italic">at large</hi>. Take care of yourself and of your goings, and fear <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> on Earth or under it.</p>
<p>Finally I promise that we will smoke a peaceful pipe together again ere long; and that together or apart we shall always love each other. God bless you, Dear Brother!</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I will send you a little word on the Cover, as I usually do, when no better may be. Jane is making some movement towards writing a word to her namesake; so the frank may come to be pretty well filled. These franks are a great &#x201C;temporal blessing&#x201D;: Jeffrey comes often about us again, and is always serviceable in that way at least.</p>
<p>The Note is for our Cousin Will Brown, who I perceive is busy at his old trade of seeking Farms again. He sent me a very anxious piteous Letter how he had offered for Linnbrigford,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >East Linbrigford was the farm which Brown had asked Carlyle to help him to get by writing to Masterton Ure.</note> and could hear nothing of it: I wrote to the Manager, and got this Note which I have folded anew and directed to Wull; whereby I think it will appear too probable that he is not to get the place, and may as well &#x2018;decline from it&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. &#x201C;The phrase of a rustic cousin of ours, kind of solemn pedant in his way&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note, Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM,</hi> I, 174).</note> without farther vexation.</p>
<p>I wrote to Jack on Tuesday last, a long and very close Letter; perhaps I shall have another from him in some three weeks. It was every way lucky that he got that situation, for nothing waited him here but hardship: I trust this may be the beginning of better things for him. For me there is no promotion in the s<supplied>[lightest]</supplied> degree probable; indeed I know not whether it be so much as desireable: <supplied>[at all]</supplied> events, I can <hi rend="italic">do without</hi> it. I sent your Message faithfully to Jack; and took part of it myself as it passed me: the beginning and end of all wisdom lies in it.</p>
<p>Let Jane not forget to write very soon, and tell me how all goes on with you. I hope my Father has recovered from his cold, and takes care of himself in this ugly weather. Do you also, my dear Mother, be very careful; that I may see you again in Spring, not wasted and sickly, but active and brisk. May we all be &#x2018;not only glad but thankful&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably coterie speech, but untraced.</note> for such blessings!</p>
<p>I cannot yet appoint any time when we are likely to move from this Babylon. Winter is <hi rend="italic">nastier</hi> here than even at Craigenputtoch, so <pb id="pg-06-77" n="06:77"/>far as weather goes: <foreign>reek</foreign>, damp and <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign>[mud], these are the three elements<supplied>[.]</supplied> However, there is much to interest one, much to instruct. I hope I shall not come home no wiser than I went. Few people speak of the Reform Bill; all are heartily sick of such jargoning about it: there will be an outburst soon, unless they get on; yet nobody expects that the business will be got done before <date when="1832-03-00">March</date>. Grant us patience! This is a frightful empire at this moment; an empire in the death-throes, and must be born anew!</p>
<p>One of the most interesting sights we see is that of some young men struggling to escape from the general baseness: one of the strangest of them is a certain W. Glen a friend of Jack&#x2019;s, born near Craigenputtoch, but last from Glasgow, and now struggling forward here to be an Advocate. He has neither father nor mother, nor kith nor kin, but one young Brother a Clerk in Glasgow. He is almost distracted with the perplexities that have encumbered him; a man of really wonderful gifts, which he can no way turn to use. Perhaps I can do him some good: at all events, he is unspeakably grateful, and looks up to me almost as his Prophet. Last night he was near kissing me!</p>
<p>I must now go, dear Mother. Bid Jane write soon: give my kindest affection to every one from my Father downwards. Remember us always: God is around us all; with Him we are all united. <closer><salute>Ever Your Affectionate Son,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>I borrowed a frank for you yesterday, expecting to have a little moment of time, when I might thank you for your punctual and so highly welcome Letters; and send a word or two in the shape of tidings, which at Scotsbrig, I know, are never superfluous. It now turns out that I have very <hi rend="italic">little</hi> time: however, I will make the most of it.</p>
<p>Your last Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> gave us both very great pleasure: it brought gratifying tidings, of the welfare of those ever dear to us; it was also most sensibly and well put together; wholly a thing creditable to you. Continue to <hi rend="italic">keep your eyes open:</hi> what else has one any hope in; but <pb id="pg-06-78" n="06:78"/>to think as earnestly as we have power; and then having <hi rend="italic">thought</hi>, and ascertained how matters lie, and what they mean, to <hi rend="italic">do,</hi> with our whole might, and quickly, whatsoever our hand findeth to do. Properly, as I often say, there is no loss in this world, but even that same so frequent in it, the <hi rend="italic">loss of head</hi>. An individual without understanding, wandering about without light to his path, is a truly hopeless figure; other miserable mortal there is, strictly speaking, none. I expect great things of you, as I have often hinted: nothing less than this, that you will prove wise and true; and in what sphere soever you find yourself, act honourably the part assigned you there.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Carlyle is thinking of Pope&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man,</hi> IV, 193&#x2013;94: &#x201C;Honour and shame from no Condition rise; / Act well your part, there all the honour lies.&#x201D;</note> This is the highest blessedness; found by few in these sad days; and yet, if we consider it, there is now or at any period there is no other possible for us. Be kind to our Mother and Father; be obedient, loving: bear with their infirmities, even where they seem unreasonable: are we not all here simply to &#x2018;bear one another&#x2019;s burdens&#x2019;?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gal. 6:2.</note> And whose burdens should we more cheerfully bear, than those of our Parents, to whom we owe all that we have, all that we are? Your course is, what mine and every other reasonable creature&#x2019;s is: wherever you find Disorder, Disarrangement (be it external, of mere bodily things; or internal, as improper conduct unreasonable feelings of the mind), to gird yourself forthwith, in all faithfulness and honest zeal, to remedy such Disarrangement, by superior Arrangement springing from yourself. The <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> that men or things behave to you, do you behave the <hi rend="italic">better</hi> to them: this is the grand rule, the sum and substance of all others. I know the task is hard, very hard for flesh and blood: nevertheless <hi rend="italic">great</hi> also is your reward. Let us think always, as the Poet Milton said, that &#x201C;we are ever in our great Taskmaster&#x2019;s eye.&#x201D;&#x2014;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>I must send you some sketches of our situation here; tho&#x2019; there is nothing very new since I wrote so largely, by the side of Jack&#x2019;s Letter from Rome. My own health continues good: I have finished off my Edinburgh Review Paper, and despatched it a week ago, within the appointed time: whether the Editor will dare to print it I cannot say; for it speaks out in plain English upon some things; neither, indeed, should I mightily care, for when I have once <hi rend="italic">told</hi> the truth, my part with it is done, and if the world will not listen, the world will just do the other way. The business of writing comes rather awkward to me <pb id="pg-06-79" n="06:79"/>here: at the same time, now when my hand is in, I do not wish to let it go out again; and so mean to begin tomorrow once more to the trade, and try a sort of sketch upon Dr Johnson. With this I shall require less pains; perhaps a matter of three weeks will see me thro&#x2019; it. Meanwhile <hi rend="italic">great</hi> plenty of other work comes flowing in upon me; I shall certainly bring home enough to serve me thro&#x2019; the summer, let me work as I may. Two or Three Magazine men are chirping to me with open arms; even offering to raise their prices! Nay, a certain learned Doctor<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Abraham Hayward (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), English essayist and miscellaneous writer. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320110-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-10">10 Jan. 1832</date></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books,</hi> p. 234.</note> of this city, offers me a kind of outlet for my old &#x201C;History of German Literature&#x201D; (which went all awry the year before last); and I am not without hope of getting things arranged so that I may close with him. I am doing what I can that way; and shall soon see thro&#x2019; it. Whether the <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> (the already written one) will get printed is still very uncertain: I have partly resolved not to take under &#xa3;100 for it; and at present everything is kept stagnant by their Reform Bill: indeed the whole business of Literature is a sort of Bedlam-broke-loose, and must soon alter, or utterly disappear; it takes a man with eyes in his head to walk thro&#x2019; the middle <supplied>[of it]</supplied> and kick the dirt of it aside from sticking on him.</p>
<p>My good Wifie has not been so well as I could wish. She made such a hand of herself, gallopping and waking and feverishly fretting before she left Scotland that now she necessarily suffers for it. Her strength is smaller than usual; she does not lie in bed, is not even dispirited; but always in a sickly sort of way. I trust however she is now past the worst; I will take better care of her another time. She is at this moment lying at my back (I mean with her feet behind my back) on the Sofa: she dare not promise to write you a word today (the time too is so near, and so uncertain for people coming in), but will if she can. We see abundance of things and persons, as usual; more and not fewer than are good for us. Tonight I am to go and have tea with the Austins (Mrs A. was here the other day); the Goody is quite out of case for going in such an evening at is looks to be: one of those horrible, frosty fogs; as dark, now at two o&#x2019;clock, as if it were twilight; smoke everywhere without doors and within, your very nostrils full of soot wholly a London day! The Bullers have come hither; we were asked by them also tonight but could not go. The Montagues I think are declining into a decided indifference on our part, which must soon be disfavour on theirs. A considerable spicing of devilry works and ferments among them: all men are sons of fallen <pb id="pg-06-80" n="06:80"/>Adam. The Badamses have not been near us for some time: we hear that they are doing well; that Badams, as I advised him, has taken to <hi rend="italic">smoke,</hi> which is better than opium and brandy. Irving still rages along here, regarded as a quack by the great body of the public, as a madman by a smaller class: indeed the majority have nearly done thinking of him, you seldom hear his name mentioned. It seems pretty certain that they will take his Church from him; and then worse things may follow: however, I am happy to think that he will not go quite distracted and into a strait waistcoat; but may wander about long (so I judge) with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> half of his head cracked, the other sound enough.</p>
<p>I grieve, my dear Sister, that the sheet is at an end (and the time with it) when I might have run on to such lengths. I must wait for another season. Tell Jenny<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s youngest sister Janet, later Mrs. Robert Hanning.</note> that I owe her too a little note for her contribution to the first Letter: tell &#x201C;Mister Cairlill&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s youngest brother James, frequently referred to in this manner.</note> that I owe him none. Jane said he had promised to write: but has he ever done it?&#x2014; I sent off a little Note for Alick, which he will get on Wednesday: I hope his new farm will do well, above all that he himself will. Write to me very soon, with all manner of minuteness. The Newspaper has come these two weeks on the Saturday, which gives me the most <hi rend="italic">abundant</hi> time to read it. If you should be late yourselves any day, do not mind much,&#x2014;I can still get a glimpse of it on Monday.&#x2014; <closer><salute>And so for the present, dear Crow,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She was nicknamed &#x201C;Crow Jean&#x201D; because of her black hair.</note> I bid thee farewell! Ever your Brother,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Aunt</salute>
<p>When I returned from Enfield, where I had been for a week; I found the box containing the memorials of my heedlessness,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her belongings which she had forgotten and left at the Welshes&#x2019; in Liverpool.</note> along with the welcome letter, awaiting me on the top of a cistern outside our staircase window; and our Landlady assures me with the utmost <pb id="pg-06-81" n="06:81"/>selfcomplacency that she had done all she could for it, in the way of keeping it perfectly cool! She looked rather blank when after duly commending her care, I informed her it was probably a cloak and shawl which she might now bring in out of the rain with all dispatch. Only to the intellect of a Co<supplied>[c]</supplied>kney would a deal box have suggested the <hi rend="italic">exclusive</hi> idea of game.</p>
<p>The cloak I got died [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] a more sober colour, and lined and furred so as effectually to exclude the cold;&#x2014;no slight conquest of art over Nature in these days&#x2014; Some people here have the impudence or ignorance to congratulate me on the agreeable change of climate I have made: but truly if my contentment depended mainly on weather I should wish myself back to our own hilltop without delay. Regarded as a place merely, this &#x2018;Noble City&#x2019; is simply the most detestable I ever lived in. One day a ferocious frost; the next a fog, so thick you might put it in your pocket; a dead sea of greencoloured filth under foot; and above an atmosphere like one&#x2014;of my Uncle&#x2019;s sugar-boilers. But as the French say <foreign><hi rend="italic">il faut se ranger</hi></foreign> [it is necessary to settle down]! and so day after day I rush forth with desperate resignation; and even find a sort of sublimity in the infinite horror thro&#x2019; which I must make my way, or&#x2014;die of indigestion. If I am inclined to reflect on the <hi rend="italic">place,</hi> however (perhaps not without a touch of national prejudice) it is certainly my bounden duty to speak well of the people&#x2014; Nowhere have I found more worth, more talent or more kindness; and I must doubly regret the ill health I have been suffering under, since it has so curtailed my enjoyment of all this&#x2014; Nevertheless tho I dare seldom accept an invitation out, I have the pleasantest evenings at home. Scarce a night passes that some acquaintance new or old does not drop in at tea, and then follow such bouts at talking! not of one &#x201C;Book&#x201D; (as my Uncle na<supplied>[m]</supplied>ed Carlyle) but several <hi rend="italic">Books</hi>&#x2014; I have seen most of the Literary people here, and, as Edward Irving said after his first interview with Wordsworth, &#x201C;I think not of them so highly as I was wont.&#x201D; These people who have made themselves <hi rend="italic">snug little reputations,</hi> and on the strength of such hold up their heads as &#x201C;one and somewhat&#x201D; are by no means the most disting<supplied>[ui]</supplied>shed th<supplied>[at]</supplied> I meet with either for talent or cultivation<supplied>[.]</supplied> Some of them indeed (Charles Lamb for instance) would not be tolerated in any society out of England&#x2014;</p>
<p>But I must abruptly conclude while I am yet but beginning&#x2014;the young man who is to be the bearer of this and whom I have requested to deliver it in person being just ready to start<supplied>[.]</supplied> He is the Son of a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Arbuckle in Galloway (known doubtless to George MacMuir<supplied>[?]</supplied>) <pb id="pg-06-82" n="06:82"/>and is bound for Liverpool to ascertain if there be an inlet there or in the neighbourhood for a Physician&#x2014; He is a very sensible good young man, and we feel sincerely interested in his wellbeing&#x2014; He will tell you all about me that you may wish to know&#x2014;and if you can cheer his first outlook on a strange place by a word of kindness you will do us a pleasure<supplied>[.]</supplied> My kindest love to my Uncle and all the <foreign>weans</foreign> <supplied>[children]</supplied>&#x2014; My mother writes that he had <hi rend="italic">writte</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">n</hi>]</supplied> her a letter&#x2014;which I was truly happy to hear.

<salute>My Dear Brother</salute>
<p>I am not without anxieties on your account; for I cannot but recollect that you volunteered, in your Letter from Rome, to write &#x201C;every three weeks,&#x201D; and now I think it is almost five, and still no second comes to hand.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written on <date when="1831-11-26">26 Nov.</date> and <date when="1832-01-01">1 Jan.</date>, but Carlyle had not received the second letter.</note> These last ten days accordingly I have rather taken to &#x201C;watch the Postman&#x201D;; which you know is none of the most pleasant employments. However, I strive to banish apprehensions, and often say to myself, Why should any evil have befallen even <hi rend="italic">now?</hi> Many risks have been happily run, since you became a Traveller: I will hope that here also there is nothing but some trifling delay caused by irregularity of Posts, or the like, and boding no mischief. At all events, I will wait no longer for your Letter; but write as matters stand, that I may not drive you into the same embarrassment. Two Letters of mine are still unacknowledged: one to Florence (<hi rend="italic">Poste Restante, Firenze</hi>); another to Rome, despatched some day or two <pb id="pg-06-83" n="06:83"/>after yours announcing your arrival in that City had reached me. As I can speculate little about your proceedings, and only hope and pray that all may be well, I will here (in my smallest type) give you what light I can about my own, as if that were the only topic this world afforded: the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> for you I will know it to be.</p>
<p>Not long ago we had a Letter from Scotsbrig (tho&#x2019; I think it was <hi rend="italic">before</hi> my last communication with you); indicating that all went well. I have written, at large, twice since then, and look for a specific detail ere long. Meanwhile the <hi rend="italic">Courier,</hi> which now goes to Scotsbrig first, and <hi rend="italic">finally</hi> t<supplied>[o]</supplied> Craigenputtoch, brings us weekly a token of their existence, and last time had &#x201C;all right&#x201D; scratched on it in Jane&#x2019;s hand. I suppose Alick to be vigorously bestirring himself for his new Farm; I have written two Notes to him, but yet have no answer: the Scotsbrig people had been able without difficulty to &#x201C;meet <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The landlord on rent-day.</note>: all seemed to be proceeding in the usual fashion. May God be thanked for it! Mrs Welsh also wrote to us lately: she is in a situation full of discomforts and difficulty; her father so failed and helpless, herself so sickly and sad: however, she struggles thro&#x2019; courageously, and not without effect does her best. This I think is all the Scottish news we have that can interest you.</p>
<p>For ourselves here, we are not in the most vigorous state, yet nowise entitled to complain. Jane, as was natural after such a tumult as she came thro&#x2019; in her passage hither, has had but a weakly time of it, now and then quite disabled: Dr Irving&#x2019;s medicaments too gave her no satisfaction; so she took the matter into her own hand, for the last four or five weeks has been living dietetically like a very Kitchiner,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Kitchiner (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), author of several books on &#x201C;domestic economy&#x201D; including <hi rend="italic">Apicius Redivivus; or, the Cook&#x2019;s Oracle</hi> (London, <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>). Carlyle may allude to his <hi rend="italic">Peptic Precepts &#x2026; to prevent and relieve indigestion</hi> (London, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>).</note> and is now growing decidedly better. She walks out every day, all wrapped in furs, cloaks, and what not, <supplied>[lifted]</supplied> out of the mud-sea on &#x201C;French clogs&#x201D;; is quite resolute in her own way, and quietly perseverant, and inde<supplied>[ed]</supplied> begins to bloom up again and look like her former self. She sees little company except what comes here; but that is enough: she has an engagement with George Irving<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Dr. Irving just mentioned above.</note> to go and call on Miss Macdonald,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> which is to be fulfilled one of these days. I myself have had no positive ailment till within this week; when a cold partly by my own mismanagement laid hold of me, and set my eyes <pb id="pg-06-84" n="06:84"/>running: I took it resolutely by the head yesterday, and what with physic, what with gruel diet have already almost conquered it; but mean to keep the house for another day still. It is a climate this of London against which all manner of objections might be made, its two great elements being unhappily <foreign><hi rend="italic">reek</hi></foreign> [smoke] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [mud]: we have had &#x201C;real London fogs&#x201D; too, the liveliest image of Pandemonium, torch-bearing spectres shouting thro&#x2019; the gloom, an atmosphere that you might &#x201C;dig with shovels.&#x201D; Then rains, and damp chill vapours, and frosts against which in these gigmanic-fashioned rooms there is no protection. But what is there in climate that by much vituperating you can alter? It is one of Heaven&#x2019;s ordinances, to be received silently, even thankfully: is not all weather so much <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> that has been lent us? No Cholera, or other epidemic yet attacks us; nor except with very cowardly people is such greatly apprehended: that Cholera will arrive seems likely; but what then? Except the name there are other far more frightful maladies which we look on with indifference. Typhus-fever, for example. At Sunderland, it seems nearly burnt out; also at Newcastle: two weeks ago it appeared at Haddington, where there have been between 20 and 30 cases, and several deaths (to us not known); it has not reached Edinburgh, but of course is dreaded there, where already there seems to be a Fever, much more fatal in its character, tho&#x2019; being only <hi rend="italic">common</hi> death, little heed is paid it. Did you see in the Newspaper that poor Dr Becker<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Ferdinand Wilhelm Becker; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271025-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:271</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1827-10-25">25 Oct. 1827</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271222-TC-JCE-01"><sic>298</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1827-12-22">22 Dec. 1827</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280201-TC-JAC-01"><sic>317</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-02-01">1 Feb. 1828</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280307-TC-JAC-01"><sic>333</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-03-07">7 March 1828</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280416-TC-JAC-01"><sic>363</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-04-16">16 April 1828</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280610-TC-JAC-01"><sic>383</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-06-10">10 June 1828</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281209-TC-JPE-01"><sic>425</sic><corr>TC to JPE, <date when="1828-12-09">9 Dec. 1828</date></corr></ref>. His death was reported in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> for <date when="1831-11-27">27 Nov. 1831</date>, where he is spoken of as the eldest son of Dr. Becker, physician in Offenbach, &#x201C;whose name is known both in this country and on the continent as an eminent philologist.&#x201D; The son is said to have been &#x201C;well known to a considerable circle of acquaintances in Edinburgh, having received the principal part of his medical education in this city, whilst he at the same time fulfilled the duties of Assistant Librarian at the Advocates&#x2019; Library, and he was a man of very high acquirements.&#x201D; He was the author of books on medicine, including <hi rend="italic">Letters on the Cholera in Prussia</hi> (London, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>). Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref></note> had died of Cholera at Berlin? Alas, it is even so; another friend is taken from us! Hegel also is dead of the same malady (the Philosopher Hegel):<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>).</note> both these events are now of old date, tho&#x2019; perhaps still unknown to you. Nor is my catalogue of mortality yet full: I went to call on Charles Buller the day before yesterday, and he confounded me by mentioning that his uncle Strachey<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Strachey (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>).</note> was dead and buried! It had been a most sudden call: on a Tuesday night (exactly this day fortnight) poor Strachey came home complaining; the disease, treated by unskilful <pb id="pg-06-85" n="06:85"/>Doctors, proved to be inflammation of the liver, which soon became inflammation of the lungs also, and on the next Tuesday Night, it was all over. Mrs Strachey, it is said, bears it courageously: I design to write, and were I once in travelling order, to go and see her. I believe her to be a genuine woman, a <foreign><hi rend="italic">sch&#xF6;ne Seele</hi></foreign> [beautiful soul]<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his essay <hi rend="italic">&#xdc;ber Anmut und W&#xfc;rde</hi> (<hi rend="italic">On Grace and Dignity</hi>) (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>), Schiller gives as his ideal &#x201C;the beautiful soul,&#x201D; who acts rightly by instinct and whose emotions are not at war with his duty, but always direct him along the right path. This ideal state, Schiller recognized, cannot always be maintained in practice. Carlyle was familiar with the term from the title of Book VI of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship,</hi> which he translated as &#x201C;Confessions of a Fair Saint.&#x201D; The &#x201C;Fair Saint&#x201D; is Mignon.</note> such as there are few; and pity her much in her new lonely state. You spoke of writing: have you ever done it? I know not that she now cares much for me; but that does not alter my care for her: we have never met since you were there.</p>
<p>With respect to my personal occupations and outlooks I will soon give you some light. I have corrected the Proof sheets of that Article &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Characteristics</hi>&#x201D; for Napier, who receives it with respect, yet finds it &#x201C;inscrutable&#x201D; on a first perusal: my own fear was that it might be too <hi rend="italic">scrutable;</hi> for it indicates decisively enough that Society (in my view) is utterly condemned to destruction, and even now beginning its long travail-throes of Newbirth. I believe it will be published in a day or two: if I can find any opportunity (of which I yet hear nothing), you shall have it sent you. Meanwhile I have various other things on the anvil: first a Paper on Johnson, probably for <hi rend="italic">Fraser,</hi> tho&#x2019; that is no good vehicle: I have spent two weeks in merely reading Croker&#x2019;s five volumes, and do not yet see my way: I design to be short and rather superficial. One <hi rend="italic">has</hi> no right vehicle: you must throw your ware into one of those dog&#x2019;s-meat carts, such as travel the public streets, and get it sold there, be it carrion or not. Each age has its capabilities; these are the capabilities of ours. Perhaps they will mend; at all events, let us use them with our whole wisdom; our whole might. Then I have some trashy thing (I yet know not what) to put together for Bulwer;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311220-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-12-20">20 Dec. 1831</date></ref>. As editor of the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine,</hi> Bulwer clearly wanted Carlyle as a contributor. He wrote to him on <date when="1832-01-11">11 Jan.</date> to invite him to review G. J. W. A. Ellis, Baron Dover&#x2019;s biography of Frederick the Great (London, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), with no restriction as to length. Carlyle contributed nothing until &#x201C;Death of Goethe&#x201D; (<date when="1832-06-00">June 1832</date>).</note> whom I have not yet seen but who writes, in sickness, cravingly. Cochrane also engages for the old <hi rend="italic">Black&#x2019;sche</hi> rate of wages,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The rate of the publishers Black, Young and Young.</note> and wishes me to do him something on <hi rend="italic">Diderot,</hi><note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Diderot,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review,</hi> XI (<date when="1833-04-00">April 1833</date>), 261&#x2013;315.</note> which <pb id="pg-06-86" n="06:86"/><supplied>[I have]</supplied> partly undertaken. Farther there are one or two bits of pieces which I have in view for Napier: but these will probably lie till I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> him. Lastly I must tell you of something much more extensive than all the rest: no less than the &#x201C;History of German Literature.&#x201D;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle never completed his <hi rend="italic">History of German Literature,</hi> though he used some of the material in various essays. The unfinished MS, found among his papers after his death and now in the Yale University Library, was first published by Hill Shine: <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s Unfinished History of German Literature</hi> (Lexington, Ky., <date when="1951-00-00">1951</date>).</note> At William Grey&#x2019;s,<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Gray&#x2019;s.

Hayward had urged him to publish Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History</hi> in either Lardner&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Cabinet Cyclopaedia</hi> (<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>, in 133 vols.) or his <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Cabinet Library</hi> (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>, 38 vols.). Although Lardner at first agreed and all but settled to pay Carlyle &#xa3;300, he changed his mind.</note> and made arrangements about the <hi rend="italic">History of G. Lit.</hi> (concerning which I felt indifferent enough); and now, after two interviews between Lardner and me, I think it is nearly settled that I am to have such a thing ready, against next <date when="1832-11-00">November</date>: I am to have 2 volumes (and &#xa3;300), to incorporate all that I have already published in <hi rend="italic">Reviews</hi> (Black grants me his permission in the handsomest way); and to produce 170 pages of new matter, binding up the whole into a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Zur Geschichte</hi></foreign> [Toward a History], to which I can put my name. Lardner I understand is a sure ready-money man; offers to get me Books, &#x26;c so I think the business will come to a bearing; indeed it had come to one apparently last time we met (a week ago), only nothing has yet been written about it: I have not even sent him my list of &#x201C;Books wanted,&#x201D; having been too busy and <hi rend="italic">catarrhal</hi> to think maturely of it. There will be much labour here; but also a kind of remuneration: moreover, I shall thereby get my hands washed of German, and my whole say about it honourably said. It is our present purpose to get on with everything belonging to London with all despatch; to take the Steamboat for Edinburgh about the month of <date when="1832-03-00">March</date>; arrange what is arrangeable with Napier, perhaps also with Tait (whose projected &#x201C;Liberal Periodical&#x201D; gives no farther note of being), and then fix ourselves once more at Puttoch for the summer; and be ready to start anywhither (if hope offer) with the ensuing winter, and set the Printers in motion. We both reckon it an all too hazardous enterprize that <pb id="pg-06-87" n="06:87"/>of taking up house here; and lodgings, even of the best as we have them here, are full of annoyances and drawbacks. Besides there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> nothing in London at present but stagnation and apprehension, and Radical Reform: <hi rend="italic">the Bill</hi> will not pass yet for months, and then&#x2014;what better shall we be?&#x2014; With <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck</hi><note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s name for <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> until <date when="1833-02-00">Feb. 1833</date>, when he not only changed the title but also emended &#x201C;Teufelsdreck&#x201D; to become the more subtle &#x201C;Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330210-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-02-10">10 Feb. 1833</date></ref>; and for an explanation of the change G.

My chief comfort is in the effect it appears to produce on young <foreign><hi rend="italic">unbestimmt</hi></foreign> [undecided] people like him: Glen was even asking for a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> perusal of it. The whole matter is none of the weightiest: yet also is it not wholly a Lie that Lucubration of Dreck&#x2019;s; it can rest for twelvemonths and will not worm-eat.

God give us more and more insight into our Duty; ever new strength to perform it! I have no other prayer.&#x2014; Of preferment, in any shape, except that of being maintained alive for writing my best indifferent Prose, there is not the faintest symptom: indeed I scarcely care twopence about it: once get your footing in Eternity, all &#x201C;Time-vestures&#x201D; are but a cobweb and the Chancellor&#x2019;s jupe like any other beggar&#x2019;s blanket.<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>Thus, dear Brother, have I given you the minutest possible description of our whereabout; you can see in some measure what we are doing, and like to do. You may perhaps get two Letters out of London yet, or perhaps something new may turn up in the interim, and detain us longer. Either way, I am content enough. I do not rue my journey to London; but already feel my mind much stimulated, and as it were filled with new matter to elaborate. It will be very useful for me to come back from time to time: tho&#x2019; I think I have hardly found a single man that has given me a new idea, and I have on the whole been called to talk far oftener than listen, yet the very view of such a <pb id="pg-06-88" n="06:88"/>huge phenomenon as London life works deeply on you, and will have its fruit.&#x2014; I have left little room for tidings of your other friends, having said so much of your Friend. Arbuckle was about settling with appearances of very tolerable omens at Banbury; but his relations seemed to wish him rather in Liverpool; so at last, after much waiting, he is to set off thither, and meet his Brother (and partner) tomorrow morning: Jane gives him a line to her uncle; I one to George Johnstone: he goes with our truest wishes; a more hopeful man than I should once have reckoned him. Indeed he seems a very good youth; both amiable and rigidly honest, prudent also and nowise without an eye to see his way. George Irving flourishes and flounders, fit fish for such a pool as London. Of Edward we have seen nothing for some weeks: his tongues go shrieking on; the Chancellor is expected to take away his Church; and now some say Henry Drummond is minded to buy it back. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gott hilf ihnen&#x2014;und uns</hi></foreign> [God help them&#x2014;and us]!&#x2014; Glen is rapidly progressing in <hi rend="italic">Lessing</hi><supplied>[,]</supplied> reads some six Fables in a night,<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lessing&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Fabeln</hi> (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>).</note> and <hi rend="italic">often</hi> visits us: I find him a person of great gifts, but in an even more &#x201C;backward state&#x201D; than I had anticipated: a man sorely beset with obstruction; indeed quite paralysed for the present by the most transcendental &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I</hi>-ety&#x201D;<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s neologism for a blend of egotism and self-consciousness.

I have told him of it, but he of course cannot see; so rages and stumbles along&#x2014;whither I know not. He is trying to write, wherein I do my best to help him; but here again there is much to be conquered. We asked him to come with us to Puttoch, but he stormfully refused. Jeffrey has written to Brougham about a &#x201C;Tancred Law studentship&#x201D; (&#xa3;100 a year) for him: Glen, if he do not go mad, will accomplish something:&#x2014;Badams has been here once; telling enormous fibs (to Jane, for I was out); seems busy about the Mint, steady in <hi rend="italic">diet</hi>, and doing well enough. Tom Holcroft also comes bawling in; a not uninteresting creature, yet he too, I fear,&#x2014;fibs. How few are there that, taken strictly, have even this the beginning and first possibility of good conduct! Of Mill (who maintains his place here), the Bullers, the Examiner (whom I mean to see soon),<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle means Fonblanque, editor of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> from <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date> to <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>.</note> Jeffrey (who comes skipping over twice a week), &#x26;c &#x26;c I shall say nothing this time for our space is done.

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>There is a frank going to Templand, and tho&#x2019; I am in doubt whether it will carry another sheet, I cannot but determine to try: we <pb id="pg-06-90" n="06:90"/>will weigh it before it go over to the Advocate&#x2019;s; if under weight, you will get this on Wednesday; if not, I will contrive some other way of transmitting it to you soon. In either case, my own feeling will be gratified; I shall have done what I could to afford you a pleasure.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago I sent you a little Note for the Dumfries Post-Office: this I think you must have got, tho&#x2019; no answer has yet reached me. The present will be the third Letter for which you are now in my debt. I am getting very desirous to hear from you; what you are doing, and forbearing; how you get on with the preparatives for Catlinns, what you think of it, and of your outlooks generally; how we are likely to find you when we return in Spring. Often does the picture of that lone mansion in the Dunscore wold come before me here; it has a strange almost unearthly character, as it comes before me standing in the lone Night in the wintry Moor, with the tumult of London raging around me, who was once your fellow hermit, and am soon to be a still more solitary hermit. I am <foreign>wae</foreign> to think that this, like all other earthly arrangements, is now drawing to its close; we shall wander no more along the Glaisters Hill:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Craigenputtoch.</note> it is the ugliest of hills, and none of us saw cheerfulness on the face of it, or anything but toil and vexation: nevertheless now when it is all past, how can we be other than sad? Alas, we ourselves are quickly passing; a little while, and <hi rend="italic">no</hi> place that now knows us shall know us any more at all forever! Let us strive to obtain a &#x201C;continuing City&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heb. 13:14.</note>; for such, by God&#x2019;s goodness, there yet is; appointed for the just man; who (in some to us wholly mysterious way, yet surely as aught is sure) &#x201C;shall dwell forever with God.&#x201D; Were it not for some faith in this, I see not how one could endure the tossing and toils of the world: but with this, while it holds steady before us, the very sorrows of our present dream of life, for it is but a dream, are blessings for us. Let us never lament, then; let us stand to it, like brave men; <hi rend="italic">expecting</hi> no reward in this world, <hi rend="italic">wishing</hi> for none; feeling that to serve our heavenly Taskmaster<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></ref>.</note> is itself the richest of all rewards.</p>
<p>On the whole, however, I cannot lament that the Puttoch Establishment is broken up. It was one that <hi rend="italic">could</hi> hardly ever have come to good; nay had there not been considerable goodness of behaviour on more than one side, it might easily have become a world&#x2019;s wonder. Thank God, none of us accuses the other that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> made him miserable! We all <hi rend="italic">did</hi> tolerably well; what we <hi rend="italic">suffered</hi> has been suffered, and <pb id="pg-06-91" n="06:91"/>leaves no sting behind it. Neither will I vex myself with the sour prospect which the wilderness now holds out for me, all alone there: I shall have work to do; I shall try to work more steadily than I was wont, and run off more frequently to have a little talk with my Friends in the distance: Often I hope to surprise you at the Catlinns, and smoke a friendly pipe at your hearth. Be a wise man, dear Brother: there is no other want one has in this mad world. Moderate every unruly feeling, of what sort soever in you; quicken every honest faculty of Order, of Diligence; this is what I call <hi rend="italic">resisting</hi> the Devil; even in these days, if resisted he must and will flee from us. I can preach only in generals, for I know not what the specialties are: and so here, with a hope and prayer that all may be well, I will terminate my sermon for this time.</p>
<p>Our plans here are getting a little more fixed: I can now give you some faint foreshadow of them. I pride myself that I have never gone half a foot out of my road in search of what are called &#x201C;prospects&#x201D;: it is yet and has always been clear to me that I was one whom Promotion was least of all likely to visit. Thank Heaven I know my trade: it is to <hi rend="italic">write truth</hi> while I can be kept alive by so doing, and to die writing it when I can no longer be kept alive. So feeling, I look upon all mortals with the friendliest humour; let Kings and Chancellors fight their own battle and all speed to them: let the Devil go his way, and I will go mine. Therefore, after settling my Author-business in London, I will not stay an hour, &#x201C;waiting at the pool,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 5:1&#x2013;9.</note> as some advise me. Now with the Author-business it stands better than we could have expected. My Book, I think, <hi rend="italic">cannot be printed</hi> at this time: here is so much certain, and therefore beneficial. Nothing is like to be stirred in till after their Reform Bill; and that may be kept for months yet: too long for us to wait. On the other hand, strangely enough, a new outlook opens: I have well nigh made a bargain with one Dr Lardner (a steady enough Editorial character) for publishing my old <hi rend="italic">History of German Literature</hi>;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320110-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref></note> in which you know I was so sadly disappointed two years ago. He is to give me fair wages for it, considering all things (&#xa3;300 for two volumes); and I am to be ready with it about next <date when="1832-11-00">November</date>. Here is &#x201C;a job of paving to serve me over the storm&#x201D;:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning to undertake lesser work during difficult times until he can find something better to do.</note> I mean to collect Books for it, and come home and set to work. Nay on all hands more work than I can do streams in on me; Editors of Magazines <pb id="pg-06-92" n="06:92"/>are urgent enough: my Paper in the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Characteristics,&#x201D; <date when="1831-12-00">Dec. 1831</date>.</note> is printed, I believe, and will be out in a day or two: I am about fastening upon another on <hi rend="italic">Samuel Johnson</hi> (to be given to the Editor that <hi rend="italic">behaves himself best</hi>);<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine,</hi> V (<date when="1832-05-00">May 1832</date>), 379&#x2013;413.</note> then I have some other little trifles: the whole of which will keep me busy till <date when="1832-03-00">March</date>; by which time I calculate the Books (for the History) may be come to hand: so that we can start for Edinburgh; there see Napier &#x26;c, and settle what is to be settled, and so in a week or two more return to Puttoch and our <hi rend="italic">old</hi> friends! This is a sketch of our nearest future. The present is nowise very disagreeable to me: on the contrary, there is <hi rend="italic">much</hi> in it to give me pleasure and encouragement. Except a little fit of cold, now gone, I have had no worse health than usual: neither, tho&#x2019; I have found no man in London that could teach me, have I wanted instruction; the very sight of this huge city is instructive and impressive: my <foreign><hi rend="italic">raike</hi></foreign> [raik: journey] hither is perhaps far from lost. I have also great reason to be gratified with my reception here: I am no Lion, not at all; yet a select few seem to respect me <hi rend="italic">very</hi> heartily, these are mostly persons who have got instruction from me, and heave [<hi rend="italic">sic:</hi> have] learned to love me: <hi rend="italic">no</hi> other way of it could please me so well. I also feel totally <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the reptile world of Authors here; wholly careless what they do or leave undone; and conscious enough of a possibility to stand in the heaven, while they are crawling in the mud. Let me thank God for it; starvation were a cheap price for such a blessing! On the whole, the world stands related to me very much as I could wish it: I find myself respected by all whose judgement I respect; feared and wondered at by a much greater number; despised, at least openly, by no one. With incessant long-continued exertion, there is <hi rend="italic">much</hi> possible for me; I may become a Preacher of the Truth, and so deliver my message in this Earth, the highest that can be entrusted to man.&#x2014; I write all this; because I know well, you love me, and heartily, as a Brother and Scholar, wish me good speed.</p>
<p>I should now send you some sort of news of what is going on hereabouts; but I have neither time nor space left: at all events there is nothing special astir. People are quite tired of talking about Reform: some 60 Peers are to be created, it is said, and the Bill will pass; and perhaps trade may permanently revive a little; for a time, it almost certainly will. I see great quantities of people here; about whom more when we meet. Do you remember the Schoolmaster Douglas of <pb id="pg-06-93" n="06:93"/>Inverkeithing?<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert K. Douglas, who became editor of the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330108-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-01-08">8 Jan. 1833</date></ref>), and then editor of the Birmingham <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>, where he later worked with Thomas Attwood and the Chartists.</note> I am not certain whether ever he came about Kirkcaldy while you were there. I saw him yesterday, for the second time: he is quite <hi rend="italic">white</hi>-headed; otherwise hale and hearty, a fierce radical; works for the Spectator Newspaper.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, a weekly founded in <date when="1828-07-00">July 1828</date> and edited by another Scot, R. S. Rintoul, was radical and pro-Reform.</note> The Bullers are here, and very kind: Charles is a promising <foreign>lad</foreign>; I gave him my <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle wrote out the word &#x201C;manuscript&#x201D; above the abbreviation.</note> Book to read, of which he seemed very proud. Poor Mr Strachey died very suddenly, about two weeks ago: I have not yet seen his amiable widow, whom I sympathize with much. The <hi rend="italic">Cholera</hi> seems spreading towards <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">us:</hi> let us hope it may not visit any of our walks: at all events, why whimper and tremble? We have but once to die.&#x2014; Jack rather lingers in writing: I am getting a little impatient; but know that the Posts are very irregular in Italy, so keep myself in quiet. The Scotsbrig Newspaper came today with an &#x201C;all well&#x201D;; for which I am very thankful: Tell them to write; and do you also write; for I have been long without news.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It is not very long since I wrote to you; yet I make no doubt you are wearying to hear from me again; as indeed I am to write again, for there are few things that give me greater pleasure. A Letter from Jack having arrived,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1832-01-01">1 Jan.</date></note> I have now a decided call made on me; and snatch a few minutes as I can get them to fulfil it. You have no notion how hard it is even to command minutes here, such streams of visitors and other interruptions come upon one: for example, since I wrote the first sentence of this, there have been no fewer than six persons, simultaneously and successively, breaking in on my privacy, and I have had to talk almost as much as would make a volume. First, Glen and some insignificant <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras;</hi></foreign> then John Mill with Detrosier<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rowland Detrosier (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), radical leader who founded Mechanics Institutes in Hulme and Salford. He had become secretary of the National Political Union, founded in London, <date when="1831-10-00">Oct. 1831</date>, to carry the first reform bill. When it was passed, the self-educated Detrosier became a popular lecturer again, treating such subjects as poverty, ignorance, and &#x201C;vicious habits.&#x201D; See the account of his lecture at the London Mechanics Institute on &#x201C;The Formation of a Good National Character and a Consistent Public Opinion&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> <date when="1831-10-16">16 Oct. 1831</date>.</note> (the Manchester Lecturer to the working Classes, whom you may have seen mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>), and, much stranger, an actual Saint-Simonian Frenchman,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gustave d&#x2019;Eichthal. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18300809-TC-GE-01">TC to GE, <date when="1830-08-09">9 Aug. 1830</date></ref>.</note> arrived as a Missionary here! I have since taken my dinner; and now sit writing before tea, after which we have another engagement: to go and hear the famous Mr Owen<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Owen (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), who had started Sunday morning lectures at the Sans Souci Institute of the Industrious Classes, Leicester Square, in <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>, and later at Burton Street Chapel and the Bazaar in Gray&#x2019;s Inn Road. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> for <date when="1832-01-22">22 Jan.</date> reports a meeting of the Association for the removing Ignorance and Poverty, at which Owen said that the Association was as &#x201C;the grain of mustard seed from which a tree would spring forth under the branches of which all the nations of the earth should yet rejoice.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> for <date when="1832-01-01">1 Jan.</date> had reported Owen&#x2019;s first social festival, part of a &#x201C;scheme for removing ignorance and poverty from the land.&#x201D; He assembled his friends, some 2000, &#x201C;in the very splendid rooms of the London Bazaar&#x201D; for a lecture &#x201C;addressed to the reason&#x201D; and for a ball to &#x201C;win the affections of the company assembled.&#x201D; The conduct of the middle and working classes was exemplary and in spite of the dancing and gaiety accorded with Owen&#x2019;s wish that the party end at twelve. Owen planned monthly entertainments of the same nature.</note> (of whom also the <pb id="pg-06-95" n="06:95"/>Newspapers are full enough) preach in his &#x201C;Institution&#x201D; for the perfection of Society, or for something else equally noble, which I forget. So you see partly how I am situated, and will take the wish for the deed.</p>
<p>My worthy and kind Correspondent &#x201C;little Jean&#x201D; has been rather stingy with me of late; tho&#x2019; I must speak in regret rather than in blame; for were she to dry up on me, what should I do? Remind her only how very long it is since I had a Letter, and how gratifying a Letter from her always is. I am not in any great <hi rend="italic">anxiety</hi>, for I struggle always to hope the best: indeed Alick wrote to me last week, bringing down the good news, at least want of ill news, to a recent date: neither will I now let myself believe that anything bad has befallen; but think always that some soon coming day will bring me direct confirmation. Alick said that you, my dear Mother, were fully as strong as usual; that the rest were all well; only that my Father<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He is writing this letter on the day of his father&#x2019;s death, news of which reached him on Tuesday, <date when="1832-01-24">24 Jan.</date> On Wednesday he excluded from himself all except his wife and started to write the tribute to his father that became the opening section of <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>. This he concluded on Sunday night, <date when="1832-01-29">29 Jan.</date></note> was again afflicted with his old complaint of cold. I pray you take all charge of him; let himself too avoid all exposure to these winter damps: he should get himself warmer clothing, above all sufficient shoes, or well-lined clogs; and not stir out at all, except he cannot help it, especially when the Sun is not shining. This advice applies also to you; only that I know you are yourself much more of a doctor than he is.</p>
<p>We are struggling along here in the old way, and now see better what we are going to do, and when we are to move. Jane has been sickly almost ever since the winter began; but by rigorous adherence to regimen is now fairly recovering, and already much stronger than she was. The weather here has been more uncomfortable, and the place altogether more full of annoyances, than one could almost anywhere else experience: <foreign>reek</foreign> [smoke] and <foreign>glar</foreign> [mud] and fogs damp and dry, these are the grand elements man Lives in on the streets of London. Were it not that the city is full of people whom it is pleasant and profitable to converse with, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is nowise the habitation I would choose for myself. You are ill-lodged, in brick houses, thin as shells, with the floors all twisted, and every article indicating its showiness and its weakness. You are ill-fed, unless you can live upon beef; your milk is of the bluest, your water of the muddiest; your eggs rotten, your potatoes wat<supplied>[e]</supplied>ry, and exactly about <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> times the price they <pb id="pg-06-96" n="06:96"/>are in Annandale, namely one penny per pound! You are ill-bedded and ill-clothed unless you prefer shew to substance; all these things are against you. Nevertheless there is a great charm in being here; at the fountain-head and centre of British activity, in the busiest and quickest-moving spot that this whole Earth contains. I find myself greatly enriched with thoughts since I came hither; and by no means disposed to repent of my journey. Nor am I without encouragements, such as I need, for holding on my way: in all open minds, I find ready access; and sometimes even grateful invitation: all people, good and bad, think of me not very much otherwise than I want them to think. Let us fight the good fight, then! In due time we shall prevail if we faint not.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Tim. 6:12 and 2 Tim. 4:7.</note> I esteem it a great blessing that I was born, that I am a denizen of God&#x2019;s Universe; and surely the greatest of all earthly blessings that I was born of parents who were <hi rend="italic">religious</hi>, who from the first studied to open my eyes to the Highest, and train me up in the ways wherein I should go.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 22:6.</note> My motto is always: Reverence God, and fear nothing; nothing either of man or devil!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I think I told you that my Paper for the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review was sent off: I have since that seen it in print, and expect that the Public will so see it, in a few days. It is resolute enough, earnest enough; and will no doubt do what good it was worthy of doing: more I cannot ask. Another Essay on <hi rend="italic">Samuel Johnson</hi>, which I counted on finishing in three weeks, is, alas, still only <hi rend="italic">put upon the stocks:</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Planned and started.</note> I have been sadly held back; first by a dirty snivelling cold which plagued for a week, then by all manner of outward and inward little hindrances, not to forget the great one, my own lazy disposition, which I have forever to strive with. But now I mean to push and press forward, and hope ere long to be thro&#x2019;; were it, as Geordy Farries often felt &#x201C;with an <hi rend="italic">aw</hi>fu&#x2019; struggle!&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190329-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:173</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1819-03-29">29 March 1819</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;I have plenty of other work lying for me: among other things let me not forget to mention that I have as nearly as possible made a bargain about publishing that <hi rend="italic">Literary History of Germany,</hi> which you heard so often of, considerable part of which is already lying written: a sponsible enough kind of man here is to give me &#xa3;300 for it, against next <date when="1832-11-00">November</date>; it is very likely, in a day or two, we shall sign and seal about it, and the whole business will be agreed upon. Besides this, I have as much work for Magazines &#x26;c as I can set my face to, and more. All this being fairly settled, and in the mean time it having become pretty evident that my <hi rend="italic">other</hi> Book (<hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck</hi>) <pb id="pg-06-97" n="06:97"/>cannot be published just now; at all events, not without being nearly thrown away,&#x2014;what remains for us but that we make ready, and in due time point our toes homeward? We have settled that we are to leave this in <date when="1832-03-00">March</date>; tho&#x2019; the precise day and date, the manner of our journey, whether we are coming round by Edinburgh <hi rend="italic">first</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c all remains unfixed. So that we shall (God willing) see you all with the first fine weather of Spring! Let us trust and hope that it will be in peace and cheerfulness; in thankfulness to the Giver of all Good, by whom such blessing is vouchsafed us!</p>
<p>I am not going to trouble you with any public news; you see enough of that in the Newspaper; and as for my own ideas on the matter I reserve them till we can speak face to face when I return. It seems as if it would be months yet before their Reform Bill were passed, and in the meanwhile all business is crippled; especially all business in Books; which, at any rate, is in the wretchedest condition every way, and indeed one of the most melancholy features of this melancholy time. The Cholera yet keeps at a distance from us; indeed it seems to be getting far nearer you; however, I will hope that our Annandale may escape the scourage, which frightens people so much; and in my opinion, quite needlessly frightens them, for scarcely have we seen a year in which some Typhus fever or other <hi rend="italic">customary</hi> pestilence did not work far greater ravages. The poor people are all quiet, tho&#x2019; very miserable many of them: it is almost positively painful to walk these streets, and see so many cold and hungry and naked and ignorant beings, and have so little power to help them.&#x2014; Poor Hogg the Ettrick shepherd is walking about here; dining everywhere, everywhere laughed at; being indeed the veriest <foreign><hi rend="italic">gomeril</hi></foreign> [good-natured fool]. He appears in public with a grey Scotch plaid, the like of which was never seen here before: it is supposed to be a trick of his Bookseller (a hungry shark, on the verge of bankruptcy) who wishes to attract notice from the cockney population, and thereby raise the wind a little. He drank whisky punch at that dinner I was at; and clattered the arrantest goodnatured <foreign><hi rend="italic">janners</hi></foreign> [foolish talk].&#x2014; Jeffrey often comes here, running over in great haste; and is brisk and busy as a bee.&#x2014; Did I tell you, or did you notice in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> that poor Doctor Becker is dead of Cholera at Berlin? He was a kind pure worthy youth, whom we in particular regret much. A still more striking death has happened at our very hand: that of Mr Strachey, after only a week&#x2019;s illness: not long ago I met him and Charles Buller one morning in the street, and now shall never meet him more. Mrs Strachey is said to behave with great resolution and resignation: I have not seen her for a long time; indeed she rather seemed to be ill at ease with me, <pb id="pg-06-98" n="06:98"/>perhaps under some awe of me: however, I mean to go myself and see her, so soon as I can command a day.&#x2014; The Bullers are here, both parents and sons, all in the friendliest relation to me. I dined there lately, and am very soon going back: the two boys are promising fellows, and may one day be heard of in the world. Charles is almost the most intelligent young man I converse with here.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I must now go, my dear Mother, and let you go. It will give you great comfort to find that Jack is so well: his Letter is unluckily quite too full of Roman antiquities, about which no one of us care a penny-piece; however it brings nothing but good news so far. It grieves me to see that he has yet got none of my Letters except one: I have written <hi rend="italic">three</hi> others, which <hi rend="italic">will</hi> surely reach him: meanwhile I am going to write a fourth, and send it off by a still safer conveyance, by the Florence Ambassador&#x2019;s Bag: Jeffrey (and Fraser too) has engaged to procure me that favour. I will tell the Doctor to be a good boy; and not to write us any more <hi rend="italic">geographical</hi> Letters. We may probably hear from him again next month; yet if not, we should not get uneasy, seeing how <hi rend="italic">very</hi> irregular the Italian Posts seem to be.</p>
<p>Alick requested me to write &#x201C;for next Wednesday&#x201D;: but as I had a Letter already on the road for him, it seemed needless to charge him with postage for anything I had to say: so if you can send the inclosed along by Nottman<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The carrier.</note> next week, it will be nearly the same. I hope the Catlinn<supplied>[s]</supplied> <supplied>[s]</supplied>peculation is considered a tolerable one, and that the new Tenant <supplied>[will]</supplied> bestir himself and balance himself (these are the two things to be done) and make an [torn] manful figure there. He has much good in him; and I still trust, will more and more succeed to cast the evil out of him. The constant faithful effort that way is all that any of us can make out.</p>
<p>You must give my brotherly affection to all the young ones; tell them that I vote with you as to this truth: that the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> blessing in the world is that of good behaviour, which lies in power of every one. They must love one another: &#x201C;Little children love one another,&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 13:33&#x2013;34.</note> this was the departing farewell precept of the Friend of Men. Tell my Father that I love and honour him. Take care of him, dear Mother, and of yourself, that I may find you both well. God ever bless you all!</p>

She married Robert Hanning (d. <date when="1878-03-12">12 March 1878</date>) on <date when="1836-03-15">15 March 1836</date>, who after failing in business in both Scotland and England emigrated to Canada in <date when="1841-09-00">Sept. 1841</date>. His wife and daughters did not join him until <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>. Hanning was employed by the Great Western Railway from <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date> to <date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>. His wife survived him until <date when="1897-12-00">Dec. 1897</date>, the last Carlyle of her generation to die. Emerson, upon visiting her in Hamilton, Ontario, in <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>, had exclaimed: &#x201C;And so this is Carlyle&#x2019;s little sister!&#x201D; Carlyle&#x2019;s letters to &#x201C;the youngest stay of the house, little Jenny,&#x201D; were published by Charles Townsend Copeland in <date when="1899-00-00">1899</date> as <hi rend="italic">Letters of Thomas Carlyle to His Youngest Sister</hi>. See Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, III, 236.</note>
<p>Will you put up with the smallest of Letters rather than with none at all? I have hardly a moment; and no paper but this thick coarse sort.</p>
<p>Understand always, my dear Sister, that I love you well, and am very glad to see and hear that you conduct yourself as you ought. To you also, my little <foreign>lassie</foreign>, it is of <hi rend="italic">infinite</hi> importance, how you behave: were you to get a Kingdom, or twenty Kingdoms, it were but a pitiful trifle compared with this whether you walked as God commands you, and did your duty to God, and to all men. You have a whole Life yet before you, to make much of, or to make little of: see you choose the <hi rend="italic">better part</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 10:42.</note> my dear little Sister, and make yourself and all of us pleased with you. I will add no more; but commend you from the heart (as we should all do one another) to God&#x2019;s keeping. May He ever bless you!</p>
<p>I am too late, and must not wait another minute. We have this instant had a long Letter from Mrs Welsh, full of kindness to our Mother, and all of you. The cheese &#x26;c &#x26;c is faithfully commemorated as a &#x201C;noble&#x201D; one: Mary also is made kind mention of. You did all very right on that occasion. Mrs Welsh says she must come down to Scotsbrig and see you all. What will you think of that? Her Father in the mean time is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> ill, and gives her incessant labour and anxiety&#x2014;</p>
<p>See to encourage Jean to write; and do you put your hand a little to the work. What does Maister Cairlill<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s brother James.</note> think of the last letter he wrote us? Was it not a letter among many? He is a graceless man&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Jane</salute>
<p>You do not write to <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> but you <hi rend="italic">write</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean&#x2019;s letter has not been found.</note> and I am content. The proverb says &#x201C;it is not lost that a friend gets.&#x201D; to which I readily accede, the more readily because a letter with us is always regarded as a common good.</p>
<p>I do not forget you in London; as you predicted&#x2014;my recollections of all I love are more vivid than at any former period. Often when I have been lying ill here amongst strangers, it has been my pleasantest thought that there were kind hearts at ho<supplied>[me]</supplied> to whom my sickness would not be a weariness; to whom I could return out of all this hubbub with affection and trust. Not that I am not kindly used here&#x2014;from the Noble Lady down to the Mistress of the Lodging, I have everywhere found unlooked for civility and at least the show of kindness. With the Noble lady however, I may mention my intercourse seems to be dying an easy natural death. Now that we <hi rend="italic">know</hi> each other the &#x201C;fine en-thu-si-asm&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, a saying of Miss Benson, sister of Mrs. Montagu. See Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, II, 181n.</note> cannot be kept alive without more hypocrisy than one of us at least can bring to bear on it. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu is an Actress&#x2014;I admire her to a certain extent but friendship for such a person is out of question.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Austin I have now seen and like infinitely better. She is coming to tea tomorrow night. If I &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">swear everlasting friendship</hi>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably coterie speech.</note> with any woman here it will be with her.</p>
<p>But the most interesting accquainta<supplied>[nces]</supplied> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <supplied>[w]</supplied>e have made <pb id="pg-06-101" n="06:101"/>are the St Simonians<supplied>[.]</supplied> You may fancy how my heart leapt when a card bearing the name of <hi rend="italic">Gustave d&#x2019;Eichthal</hi> was sent up the other day when I happened to be alone. Our meeting was most cordial and as he talks good English we contrived to carry on a pretty voluble conversation till Carlyle came home and relieved me. He is a creature to love at first sight&#x2014;so gentle and trustful and earnest looking&#x2014;ready to do and suffer all for his faith. A friend accompanies him whom we had here today along with Mill and Detrosier. A stronger perhaps nobler man than Gustave with whom Carlyle seems to be exceedingly taken. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> (Duverry<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Duveyrier (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">66</date>), dramatist, journalist, leading St.-Simonian.

<salute>My dearest Mother,</salute>
<p>I was down stairs this morning when I heard the Postman&#x2019;s knock, and thought it might be a Letter from Scotsbrig: hastening up I found Jane with the letter open, and in tears. The next moment gave me the stern tidings. I had written you yesterday, a light hopeful Letter, which I could now wish you might not read, in these days of darkness: probably you will receive it just along with this; the first red seal so soon to be again exchanged for a black one. I had a certain misgiving, not seeing Jane&#x2019;s customary &#x201C;all well&#x201D;; and I thought, but did not write (for I strive usually to banish vague fears) &#x201C;the pitcher goes often to the well, but it is broken at last.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 12:6.</note> I did not know that this very evil had already overtaken us.</p>
<p>As yet I am in no condition to write much: the stroke, all unexpected tho&#x2019; not undreaded, as yet painfully crushes my heart together; I have yet hardly had a little relief from tears. And yet it will be a solace to me to speak out with you, to repeat along with you that great saying, which could we lay it rightly to heart includes all that man can say: &#x201C;It is God that has done it; God support us all!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His mother&#x2019;s words. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320124-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-24">24 Jan.</date></ref></note> Yes my dear Mother, it is God that has done it; and our part is reverent <pb id="pg-06-103" n="06:103"/>submission to His Will, and trustful prayer to Him for strength to bear us thro&#x2019; every trial.</p>
<p>I could have wished, as I had too confidently hoped, that God had ordered it otherwise: but what are our wishes and wills? I trusted that I might have had other glad meetings and pleasant communings with my honoured and honour-worthy Father in this world: but it was not so appointed; we shall meet no more, till we meet in that <hi rend="italic">other</hi> sphere, where God&#x2019;s Presence more immediately is; the nature of which we know not, only we know that it is of God&#x2019;s appointing, and therefore altogether <hi rend="italic">good</hi>. Nay already, had we but faith, our Father is not parted from <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, but only withdrawn from our bodily eyes: the Dead and the Living, as I often repeat to myself, are alike with God: He, fearful and wonderful, yet good and infinitely gracious, encircles alike both them that we see, and them that we cannot see. Whoso trusteth in Him has obtained the victory over Death: the King of Terrors is no longer terrible.</p>
<p>Yes, my dear Mother and Brothers and Sisters, let us see also how mercy has been mingled with our calamity. Death was for a long time ever present to our Father&#x2019;s thought; daily and hourly he seemed meditating on his latter end: the end too appears to have been mild as it was speedy; he parted, as gently as the most do from this vale of tears; and Oh! in his final agony, he was enabled to call, with his strong voice and strong heart, on the God that had made him to have mercy on him! Which prayer, doubt not one of you, the All-merciful <hi rend="italic">heard</hi>, and in such wise as infinite Mercy might, gave answer to. And what is the Death of one dear to us, as I have often thought, but the setting out on a Journey an hour before us, which Journey we have all to travel: what is the longest earthly Life to the Eternity, the Endless, the Beginningless, which encircles it? The oldest man and the newborn babe are but divided from each other by a single hairsbreadth. For myself I have long continually meditated on Death, till, by God&#x2019;s grace, it has grown transparent for me, and holy and great rather than terrific; till I see that &#x201C;Death, what mortals call Death, is properly the beginning of Life.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 5:24.</note>&#x2014; One other comfort we have, to take the bitterness out of our tears: this greatest of all comforts, and properly the only one: that our Father was not called away till he had done his work, and done it faithfully. Yes, my beloved Friends, we can with a holy pride look at our Father, there where he lies low, and say that his Task was well and manfully performed; the Strength <pb id="pg-06-104" n="06:104"/>that God had given him he put forth in the ways of honesty and well doing; no eye will ever see a hollow deceitful work that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> did: the world wants one true man, since he was taken away. When we consider his Life, thro&#x2019; what hardships and obstructions he struggled, and what he became and what he did, there is room for gratitude that God so bore him on. Oh, what were it now to us that he had been a King; now when the question is not: What <hi rend="italic">wages</hi> hadst thou for thy work? But: <hi rend="italic">How</hi> was thy work done? My dear Brothers and Sisters, sorrow not I entreat you, sorrow is profitless and sinful; but meditate deeply every one of you on this. None of us but started in Life with <hi rend="italic">far</hi> greater advantages than our dear Father had: we will not weep for him; but we will go and do as he has done. Could I write my Books, as he built his Houses, and walk my way so manfully thro this shadow-world, and leave it with so little blame, it were more than all my hopes. Neither are you, my beloved Mother, to let your heart be heavy. Faithfully you toil<supplied>[e]</supplied>d by his side, bearing and forbearing as you both could: all that was sinful and of the Earth has passed away; all that was true and holy remains forever, and the Parted shall meet together again with God. <hi rend="italic">Amen! So be it!</hi> We your children, whom you have faithfully cared for, soul and body, and brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, we gather round you in this solemn hour, and say, be of Comfort! Well done, hitherto; persevere and it shall be <supplied>[well!]</supplied> We promise here before God, and the awful yet merciful work of God&#x2019;s Hand, tha<supplied>[t we]</supplied> will continue to love and honour you, as sinful children <supplied>[can]</supplied> and now do you pray for us all, and let us all pray in such language as we have for one another; so shall this sore division and parting be the means of a closer union. O let us all and every one know that tho&#x2019; this world is full of briars and we are wounded at every step as we go, and one by one must take farewell, and weep bitterly, yet &#x201C;there remaineth a rest for the people of God.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 4:9.</note> Yes for the people of God there remaineth a Rest, that Rest which in this world they could nowhere find.</p>
<p>And now again I say do not grieve any one of you beyond what nature forces and you cannot help. Pray to God, if any of you have a voice and utterance; all of you pray always in secret and silence, if faithful, ye shall be heard <hi rend="italic">openly</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 6:6.</note> I cannot be with you to speak; but read in the Scripture, as I would have done. Read, I especially ask, in Matthew&#x2019;s Gospel that Passion and Death and Farewell blessing and command of &#x201C;Jesus of Nazareth&#x201D;; and see if you can understand <pb id="pg-06-105" n="06:105"/>and feel what is the &#x201C;divine depth of Sorrow&#x201D;;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor,</hi> pp. 189, 193.</note> and how even by suffering and sin man is lifted up to God, and in great darkness there shines a light.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 112:4.</note> If you cannot read it aloud in common; then do each of you take his Bible in private and read it for himself. Our business is not to lament, but to <hi rend="italic">improve</hi> the lamentable, and make it also peaceably work together for greater good.</p>
<p>I could have wished much to lay my honoured Father&#x2019;s head in the grave: yet it could have done no one good save myself only, and I shall not ask for it. Indeed, when I remember, that right would have belonged to John of Cockermouth,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle of Cockermouth (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>), sometimes called &#x201C;of Scotsbrig,&#x201D; which he once farmed, was the only child of the father James Carlyle&#x2019;s first marriage to a cousin Janet Carlyle. He emigrated to Canada later in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> and died there.</note>&#x2014;to whom offer in all heartiness my brotherly love. I will be with you in spirit, if not in person: I have given orders that <hi rend="italic">no one</hi> is to be admitted here till after the funeral on Friday: I mean to spend these hours in solemn meditation and self-examination, and thoughts of the Eternal; such seasons of grief are sent us even for that end; God knocks at our heart, the question will we open or not?&#x2014; I shall think every night of the Candle burning in that sheeted room, where our dear Sister also lately lay. O God be gracious to us; and bring us all one day together in himself! After Friday, I return as you too must, to my worldly work; for that also is work appointed us by the heavenly Taskmaster.&#x2014; I will write to John tonight or tomorrow. Let me hear from you again so soon as you have composure. I shall hasten all the more homewards for this. For the present I bid God ever bless you all! Pray for me, my dear Mother; and let us all seek consolation <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. <closer><salute>I am ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It will be a sad thing, as it is by no means an unlikely one, if this Letter should reach you before any of the other three which I have written, and which, it appears by the last news from you, had not come to hand. Prepare yourself for a heavy loss: it has pleased God to call our dear Father to his final rest. This morning, quite unexpectedly as you will see, I received a Letter from our Sister Jane, of which I send you an exact copy:</p>
<dateline><place>&#x201C;Scotsbrig</place>, <date when="1832-01-22">January 22<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> 1832</date>.</dateline>
<salute>&#x201C;My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>&#x201C;It is now my painful duty to inform you that our dear Father took what we thought was a severe cold last monday night:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1832-01-16">16 Jan.</date></note> he had great difficulty in breathing, but was always able to sit up most of the day, and sometimes to walk about the doors; last night he was in the Kitchen about six o&#x2019;clock, but he was evidently turning very fast worse in breathing. He got only one right night&#x2019;s sleep since he turned ill, and had been sometimes insensible; but when one spoke to him, he generally recollected himself. But last night he fell into a sort of stupor, about ten o&#x2019;clock, still breathing higher and with greater difficulty: he spoke little to any of us, seemingly unconscious of what he did; came over the bedside, and offered up a prayer to Heaven in such accents as it is impossible to forget. He departed almost without a struggle this morning at half past six.&#x2014; The funeral is to be on friday<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane is writing on Sunday; the funeral was to be on <date when="1832-01-27">27 Jan.</date></note>; but my Mother says she cannot expect you to be here; however you must write to her directly, she needs consolation, tho&#x2019; she is <pb id="pg-06-107" n="06:107"/>not unreasonable, but it was very unexpected. Poor Alick will receive the mournful tidings by J. Austin tonight. The Doctor durst do nothing.&#x2014; Oh my dear Brother, how often have we written &#x201C;all well&#x201D;! I cannot write more at present&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your affectionate Sister,</salute></closer></p>
<name>&#x201C;Jane Carlyle.&#x201D;</name>
<p>Subjoined in our Mother&#x2019;s hand are these words: &#x201C;It is God that has done it; be still my dear Children&#x2014; Your affectionate Mother.&#x2014; God support us all.&#x201D;</p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>I have written back a long Letter to them this day, and promised that I would instantly write to you. Your last Roman Letter (<date when="1832-01-02">2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> January</date>) with a heap of others written only yesterday, was already on the road, and probably the two will arrive together&#x2014;on thursday. It was Sunday morning when the event took place, this is tuesday evening. We have given orders that no one is to be admitted here till after Friday: that space I devote to recollect myself, to consider my calamity, and what I have lost in the Departed.</p>
<p>To you, dear Brother, I will only say what I have said already elsewhere: Mourn not more than is unavoidable; lay the matter solemnly to heart, and study to turn it to good. We have reason to say that mercy has been mingled with our affliction; that our dear Father&#x2019;s end was happy. He had lived to do all his work, and he did it manfully and truly. Let us imitate him; let us labour as he did in patient honesty, in prudent diligent welldoing. His departure too was soft and speedy: that last strong cry of his in the death-struggle to God for deliverance; that is one of the things we must remember forever. Was it not the fit end of a Life so true and brave? For a true and brave man, such as there are too few left, I must name my Father: if we think what an element he began in, how he with modest unwearied endeavour turned all things to the best, and what a little world of good he had created for himself, we may call his life an honourable, a noble one. In some respects, there is perhaps no man like him left. Jane and I were just remarking two days ago that we did not know any man whose spiritual faculties had such a stamp of natural Strength: alas we knew not that already he was hidden from our eyes! I call such a man, bred up in poor Annandale, with nothing but what the poor <hi rend="italic">chances</hi> of Annandale gave him, the true Preacher of a Gospel of Freedom, of what man can do and be. Let his memory be forever holy to us: let us, each in his several sphere, go and do likewise.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-108" n="06:108"/>For myself, Death is the most familiar of all thoughts to me, my daily and hourly companion. Death no longer seems terrible; and tho&#x2019; saddest remembrances rise round you, and natural grief will have its course, we can say with our heroic Mother: &#x2018;It is God that has done it.&#x2019; Death properly is but a hiding from <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, from our fleshly organs; the Departed are still with us; are not both they and we in the hand of God? A little while, and we shall all meet; nay perhaps <hi rend="italic">see</hi> one another again! As God will! He is great; He is also good. There we must leave it, weep and murmur as we will.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Wednesday Morning.</hi>&#x2014; I feel, my dear Brother, how this stroke must pain you: speak of it as we may, Death is a stern event. Yet also a great and sacred one. How holy are the Dead! They do rest from their labours, and their works follow them. A whole section of the Past seems departed with my Father; shut out from me by an impassable barrier. He could tell me about old things, and was wont most graphically to do so, when I went to Scotsbrig: now he will do so no more; it is past, past! The Force that dwelt in him had expended itself, he is lost from our eyes in that ocean of Time, wherein our little islet of Existence hangs suspended, ever crumbling in, ever anew bodying itself forth. Fearful and wonderful! Yet let us know that under Time lies Eternity; if we appear, and are (while here) <hi rend="italic">in</hi> Time and thro&#x2019; Time, which means Change, Mortality,&#x2014;we also stand rooted in Eternity, where there is no Change, no Mortality. Be of comfort, then; be of Courage! &#x201C;The fair flowers of our garland,&#x201D; said Novalis, &#x201C;are dropping off Here one by one, to be united again Yonder, fairer and forever.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 13.</note> Let it so please God! His will, not ours be done!&#x2014;</p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>It were quite foreign to your mood of mind, as it is to mine, to enter on any lower matter for the present. I will only tell you what little it seems indispensable for you to know; properly the summary of what you should have known already, had not some unaccountable irregularity of the Posts prevented. Your Letters have all come safe and duly to me: how is it then that not one of mine, as duly written and despatched, has come to you? Since the Turin one I have written <hi rend="italic">three</hi>, closely filled and minutely narrative: the last went off (I think) on the <date when="1832-01-10">10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of January</date>; the others at about intervals of a month during the space before. Could the address be wrong? It was thus: &#x201C;Al Signor / J. A. Carlyle M.D. / Poste Restante / in Firenze (Florence <pb id="pg-06-109" n="06:109"/>Italy)&#x201D;; the next two &#x201C;in Roma.&#x201D;&#x2014;I inquired at the General Post-office here; but could obtain no clue to the phenomenon; no accident that they knew of had happened to any Italian mail, Letters paid and put into <hi rend="italic">any</hi> receiving office were perfectly safe. Jeffrey advised the Foreign Office, which accordingly (by his help) I mean to try this time. I am very sorry for you, my dear Brother: three months without tidings is quite grievous. My comfort is that knowing my punctuality, you will even now impute the mischief <hi rend="italic">solely</hi> to the Carriers of the Mail. I will go on writing at short intervals (of some three weeks, as you propose); and you I trust will do the like. Your Letters as I said come quite correctly: they are very precious to us; and always very interesting, <hi rend="italic">except</hi> (and I pray you again to note this) when you become <hi rend="italic">topographical</hi> and cease to be biographical. Write all that faithfully down in your Journal, but tell us <hi rend="italic">exclusively</hi> about Persons, above all about yourself. <hi rend="italic">Nothing</hi> else has any the smallest interest for us. I send forward your Letters regularly to Scotsbrig. I hope and trust this Letter or some of the others before it will get to you. Alas! Except this with the bad news, there was nothing of intrinsic importance in any of the others. I had said in general that they were all well in Scotland; that Alick had got an Annandale farm and was leaving Craigenputtoch. That my Jane had been sickly and was still so, but improving; that I had bargained for publishing my German Literary History (&#xa3;300, two volumes, with Lardner), had given up the idea of getting the other Book printed; and that we meant to return home in the month of <date when="1832-03-00">March</date>.&#x2014; Death also was not idle, tho&#x2019; not till now had he struck our little household. Mr Strachey died very suddenly three weeks ago: Dr Becker also at Berlin, some months sooner, of cholera. The cup goes round.</p>
<p>I must now, my dear Brother, again bid you farewell. <hi rend="italic">Be a good man:</hi> herein and herein only have we a tower of strength. Let us not weep for our Father; let us go an<supplied>[d]</supplied> imitate him: let us honour his memory by being good men, and so increasing and continuing the good he was the means of. I shall write to you more cheerfully next time: one&#x2019;s heart is too much in heaviness at all times; at present it is excuseable. Let us love one another, one and all; and in <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> (if we have no voice&#x2014;which is a misery) pray for one another. Jane sends you her sisterly love: perhaps she may <hi rend="italic">write</hi> it, if she join me in time.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have determined to write you a few lines today; my mind, and I trust yours also being in a state of composure: tho&#x2019; there is specially nothing more to be <hi rend="italic">said</hi>, the very sound of my voice will do you good.</p>
<p>Since I wrote last, I have been at Scotsbrig rather than in London<supplied>[;]</supplied> the tumult of this chaos has rolled past me as a sound, all empty, with which I had nothing to do. My thought was in the house of mourning; present with you and with the Departed. I sent off a full Letter to John, the next day after yours: on him too I strove to impress the necessity there was not to <hi rend="italic">grieve</hi>, but only to <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">do</hi>. The stroke is as a Lesson to us: well for us if we can know the solemn meaning of it, and lay it faithfully to heart. We had excluded <hi rend="italic">all</hi> external communication from us till the Funeral should be passed; I dwelt with my deceased Father; our whole speech and action was of high solemn matters. I walked out, alone or with my Wife; meditating, peaceably conversing of that great event. I have reason to be very thankful that much composure has been vouchsafed me: I never so <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> my honoured Father, and his earnest toilsome manful Life, <pb id="pg-06-111" n="06:111"/>as now when he was gone from me; I never so loved him, and <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> as if his spirit were still living in me; as if my Life were but a continuation of his, and to be led in the same valiant spirit, that, in a quite other sphere, so distinguished. Be the great Father thanked for His goodness; chiefly for this, if he have given us any Light and Faith to discern and reverence His mysterious ways, and how from the depths of Grief itself there rises mildly a holy eternal Joy!</p>
<p>Edward Irving, on sending up his name, was admitted to me on Friday afternoon:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1832-01-27">27 Jan.</date></note> his wife was with him; he prayed with us, I think about the time they would be in the Churchyard. I felt that he meant kindly; yet cannot say that either his prayer or his conversation worked otherwise on me than disturbingly. I had partly purposed sending for him; but was then thankful I had not done it. His whole mind is getting miserably crippled and weakened; his inane babble about his tongues and the like were for me like froth to the hungry and thirsty. My Father was a <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>, and should be mourned for like a man. We had to <hi rend="italic">forget</hi> our well-meaning visiters [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]; and again take counsel with ourselves; and I trust, with the God that dwells in us,&#x2014;were this last done only in <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>. My Father&#x2019;s memory has become very holy to me; not sorrowful, but great and instructive. I could repeat, tho&#x2019; with tears, yet with softly resolved heart: &#x201C;Blessed are the Dead that die in the Lord; they do rest from their labours; and their works follow them.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Rev. 14:13.</note> Yes, their <hi rend="italic">works</hi> are not lost; no grain of Truth that was in them but belongs to Eternity, and cannot die.</p>
<p>Jane faithfully bore and suffered with me: we spoke much, I trust that she too is one day to &#x201C;become perfect thro&#x2019; suffering,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 2:10.</note> and even in this Earth to struggle unweariedly towards perfection, as towards the one thing needful. We talked of Death and Life, with the significance of each; of the Friends we had lost; of the Friends still mercifully left us, and the Duties we owed to them. In our two Fathers we found a great similarity, with so much outward difference: both were <hi rend="italic">true</hi> Men, such as the world has not many to show now; both faithfully laboured according to their calling in God&#x2019;s vineyard (which this world is): both are now in the Land of Truth and Light while we still toil in that of Falsehood and Shadows: a little while, and we too &#x201C;shall reap if we faint not.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gal. 6:9.</note> Of the other world it seems to me we do know this, and this only: that it too is God&#x2019;s World; and that for <pb id="pg-06-112" n="06:112"/>us and for our Buried ones he hath done, and will do, all things <hi rend="italic">well</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Mark 7:37.</note> Let us rest here: it is the anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 6:19.</note> other safety is there none.</p>
<p>To you also, my dear Mother, I trust the call has not been made in vain. I know that you have borne yourself with heroism, for you have the true Strength in you. Sad doubtless will your mood long be: sadder perhaps than ours, than mine. Your loss is the keenest. The Companion, that had pilgrimed by your side for seven and thirty years, is suddenly called away; looking on that hand you now see yourself <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>. Not alone, dear Mother, if God be with you! Your children also are still round you, to bear up your declining years, to propect [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and support you, to love you with the love we owed <hi rend="italic">both</hi> our parents. Oh! Providence is very merciful to us.</p>
<p>Neither let any one of us, looking back on the Departed, mourn uselessly over our faults towards him,&#x2014;as in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things we err and come short. How holy are the Dead; how we willingly take <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the blame on ourselves, which in life we were so willing to divide! I say, let us not lament and afflict ourselves over these things. They were of the Earth, earthy;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Cor. 15:47.</note> now <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has done with them; they do him (nay, except for his own earthly sinfulness, they <hi rend="italic">did</hi> him) no evil. Let us remember only, one and all of us, this Truth, and lay it well to heart, in our whole conduct: that the Living also will one day be Dead!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On the whole, it is for the living only that we are called to live, &#x201C;to work while it is still Today.&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 9:4, and Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 197.</note> We will dismiss vain sorrows; and address ourselves, wi<supplied>[th]</supplied> new heart, and purer endeavour, to the Tasks appointed us in Life. Forward! Forward! Let us <hi rend="italic">do</hi> more faithfully than ever, what yet remains to be done. All else is unprofitable, and a wasting of our strength.</p>
<p>We two are purposing to come homeward early in <date when="1832-03-00">March</date>; and shall most likely come to Scotsbrig first. I have (or found I had already) as good as concluded that Bargain about the <hi rend="italic">Literary History:</hi> only about some Books necessary for it, and other <foreign>etceteras</foreign>, there is still some delay. I have a Paper of <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> (as I told you) to write; and many little odds and ends to adjust: after which, we seem to have no business to do here, and shall march, and leave it for the time. For myself I fear not the world; or regard it a jot, except as the great Task-garden of the Highest; wherein I am called to do <hi rend="italic">whatsoever</hi> <pb id="pg-06-113" n="06:113"/>work the Taskmaster of Men (wise are they that can hear and obey him!) shall please to appoint me.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></ref>.</note> What are its frowns or its favours? What are its difficulties and falsehoods and hollow threatenings to me? With the spirit of my Father, I will front them, and conquer them. Let us fear nothing; only being the Slaves of Sin and Madness: these are the only real Slaves.</p>
<p>Make Jane at all events write to me. I have no reason to think you are in trouble and disturbance; all worldly things I think were settled and clear before this Event overtook us; these, let me trust, could not deepen your distress. Yet I long much to hear <hi rend="italic">how</hi> it is; how you all are, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> especially, dear Mother, who have the most to bear, and are the least able to bear it. As you said: God support us all! We are now without our Head, the All-wise has taken him from us: it behoves each of us to look the more strictly to his own goings.</p>
<p>Jane is out, or she would have sent you her blessing, her affection. She is distinctly growing better; and I hope will have recovered her usual strength ere long. Perhaps she too needed Affliction; as which of us does not? Remember us always, as we do you. Say to each of my Sisters that I love them, that their best interest is on my heart. God ever bless you all!&#x2014; <closer><salute>I remain, Dear Mother,&#x2014; Your affectionate Son,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear James,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; you do not write to me, I know well, it is no want of brotherly affection; but only some half-foolish yet not blameable fear lest you do not write well enough. One day, you will be persuaded to lay that aside; and, just as you can, be it never so imperfectly, come into honest communication with me, like the rest of them.</p>
<p>I have but a few moments of time at present: yet I must address some hurried words to you on this solemn occurrence that has taken place among us: I am your eldest Brother, that have travelled farthest into Life, and mean honestly and lovingly by you. Listen to me honestly and lovingly.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-114" n="06:114"/>You are now, my dear Brother, in a quite new relation: think deeply, I pray you, of the new Duties it brings with it; summon your whole strength, clear yourself of every sinful obstruction, to discharge these. I might write you volumes of advices, had I room; but they are all comprised in this one advise, if you will understand it well: To think and inquire by <hi rend="italic">all</hi> methods what is <hi rend="italic">God&#x2019;s command</hi> for you to do; and then with your whole soul, and quickly, <hi rend="italic">do it.</hi>&#x2014;My dear Brother, you may depend upon it, this is a high, infinite concern; not to be discharged lightly, and once for all, but returning on us daily and hourly; and tho&#x2019; forgotten by most men, yet <hi rend="italic">infinitely miserable</hi> for any man to forget. I know something of you; and what worth and faculty, developed or still undeveloped, lies in you: I trust confidently to see you do <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, and daily better and better: I shall watch with deepest anxiety to observe whether my prognostics were good.&#x2014;&#x2014; A word or two more I will add of a more particular tendency:</p>
<p>You are now, in some sense, the head of the house; you are the <hi rend="italic">man</hi> of it, and have in many things to take charge, where you had formerly only to do bidding: Bethink you well of the new Duties this calls for, the new order of thoughts. Consider that above all things the duty of a Steward is to <hi rend="italic">be just:</hi> you are not to take a side, and <hi rend="italic">advocate</hi> this or that; but you are to <hi rend="italic">judge</hi> it, and do justice in it, were it against yourself.</p>
<p>To honour and love and patiently bear with our Father and Mother is commanded by God and Nature: now that we have no Father on Earth, doubly honour and cherish our Mother. Oh be kind to her, kind and grateful, however much it cost you. This is distinctly your most sacred Duty, and mine and every one&#x2019;s. God assist us to discharge it!</p>
<p>Consider that it is man&#x2019;s lot and part to <hi rend="italic">bear</hi> and <hi rend="italic">forbear:</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;If anyone would take these two words to heart and use them for his own guidance and regulation, he will be almost without sin and will lead a very peaceful life. These two words are bear and forbear.&#x201D; Epictetus (Aulus Gellius, <hi rend="italic">Noctes Atticae</hi>, xvii, 19).</note> be not astonished if you are <hi rend="italic">habitually</hi> called to do so.</p>
<p>This likewise I reckon a golden rule: <hi rend="italic">to speak the Truth,</hi> on all occasions, and to all men, with a <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi> strictness. You cannot be too strict. Without speaking the truth, how can any one <hi rend="italic">act</hi> the Truth; and what is he whose whole Life is one Lie?&#x2014; Remember the name you are called, and who last bore it. <hi rend="italic">His</hi> Life was a Truth, a Courageous Truth: let us all go and do likewise!</p>
<p>I think you <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to make worship in our Father&#x2019;s house, and be <pb id="pg-06-115" n="06:115"/>the Priest of it (as the <hi rend="italic">man</hi> should) in so far as your views will allow. Hypocrisy indeed is a thing I would have you ever avoid and keep far from you. If you cannot pray openly without hypocrisy, without inward constraint, pray in <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>, in secret: and at least every Sabbath Evening<supplied>[.]</supplied> <supplied>[I would]</supplied> have you gather the whole household round you, and devoutly with a devout earnest heart, read to them from the Bible the things that concern their everlasting interests. This I myself practice; and do seriously counsel you regularly to do.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Oh! my dear Brother, how much more was to be said.&#x2014; I am interrupted.&#x2014; Study to be a good man, and live worthy of the na<supplied>[me]</supplied> you are called by. God bless you!&#x2014; <closer><salute>I am eve<supplied>[r your]</supplied> affectionate,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>

<p>Having an opportunity today, I write to warn you (in case it should be of consequence) that my hands are quite full and over-flowing at present; so that for some time, nothing I fear is to be expected of me.

<p>Mr Rees,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Longmans, Rees &#x26; Co. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310824-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-24">24 Aug. 1831</date></ref>.</note> on being applied to, sent me up the last Number of the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>; of which I hear on all hands nothing but good. I suppose, the copy intended for me is still lying in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Unexpected occurrences force me to give up the hope of returning by way of your City: I must hasten home, direct into Annandale; and make a visit to Edinburgh afterwards. The hand of Death has been busy in my circle, as I learn that it has been in yours; painfully reminding us that &#x201C;here we have no continuing City.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 13:14.</note> The venerated Friend that bade me farewell, cannot welcome me when I come back; I have now no Father,&#x2014;in this land of shadows.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will be in <date when="1832-04-00">April</date> or <date when="1832-05-00">May</date> that I shall see you; I have much to inquire and settle; in your Libraries also something to do. We leave London, as early as possible in <date when="1832-03-00">March</date>.</p>
<p>I write at present mainly to ask you about some Poetical Pieces, entitled <hi rend="italic">Corn-Law Rhymes</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Village Patriarch</hi>, &#x26;c; and whether a short notice of them would be acceptable for your next Number. The Author appears to be a middle-aged Mechanic, at least Poor Man, of Sheffield or the neighbourhood; a Radical, yet not without devoutness; passionate, affectionate, thoroughly in earnest. His <hi rend="italic">Rhymes</hi> have more of sincerity, and genuine natural fire than anything that has come in my way of late years: both on himself and his writings, and their social and moral purport, there were several things to be said. I would also willingly do the unknown man a kindness, or rather a piece of justice; for he is, what so few are, a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> and no <hi rend="italic">Clotheshorse</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ebenezer Elliott (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), poet and radical, founded the Sheffield Mechanics&#x2019; Anti-Bread-Tax Society about <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date> and then suspended it to support parliamentary reform through the Sheffield Political Union. He published <hi rend="italic">The Village Patriarch</hi> (<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>) and then <hi rend="italic">Love; A Poem</hi> (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Corn-Law Rhymes</hi> (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>).

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The editor of the <hi rend="italic">Magazine</hi> having decided not to publish this translation, I place it, according to my promise, at your entire disposition. I fully authorize you to print or to burn it, or to do what you wish with it, upon the single condition that <hi rend="italic">my name be not mentioned</hi>.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;translator&#x2019;s note&#x201D; is undoubtedly useless now; however I send it to you as well; in it I openly express my impression of the possible influence of Saint-Simon and his work upon our English public, and this in terms rather less favourable than the opinion I formed of this last work (an opinion to which I was naturally forced). My duty, in regard to this subject is, I believe, now accomplished.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had been sent a copy of Saint-Simon&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Nouveau Christianisme</hi> (Paris, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>) by Gustave d&#x2019;Eichthal; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300809-TC-GE-01">TC to GE, <date when="1830-08-09">9 Aug. 1830</date></ref>. By <date when="1830-12-19">19 Dec. 1830</date>, when he wrote to John Carlyle, he had finished his translation, and written what he calls &#x201C;a very short introduction.&#x201D; In this letter and <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310121-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-01-21">21 Jan. 1831</date></ref>, he mentions possibly asking John to look for a publisher in London, or submitting it to the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>. Later it was passed to John Bowring, editor of the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310711-TC-JOBO-01">TC to <sic>JB</sic><corr>JOBO</corr>, <date when="1831-07-11">11 July 1831</date></ref>) and was still in his hands in <date when="1831-10-00">October 1831</date>. It was rejected, and so Carlyle was now free to send it to Gustave d&#x2019;Eichthal. Hill Shine, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle and the St. Simonians</hi> (Baltimore, <date when="1941-00-00">1941</date>), p. 92, and &#x201C;Carlyle and <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> &#x2018;Letter on the Doctrine of St. Simon,&#x2019;&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries</hi>, 171 (<date when="1936-00-00">1936</date>), 291&#x2013;93, suggests (i) that the manuscript had passed through the hands of another editor in addition to Bowring, (ii) that the &#x201C;Letter&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi>, V (<date when="1832-07-00">July 1832</date>), 666&#x2013;69, is a &#x201C;reworking&#x201D; of Carlyle&#x2019;s short introduction, and (iii) that the manuscript of the translation will still be found in the Biblioth&#xE8;que de l&#x2019;Arsenal. There is no reason to think the first supposition is true; the second and third must be left as matters of opinion.</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I was gratified with your Letter of the <date when="1832-01-27">27<hi rend="italic">th</hi> January</date>, on Tuesday; and do not miss a post in answering it, the rather as there will be at any rate some disappointment about Mr Burrell&#x2019;s Books, Saunders &#x26; Otley whom I went and called upon directly, having, as they said, &#x201C;declined the order.&#x201D; Happily the Packets still sail, and of them we can take advantage.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had asked in his letter of <date when="1832-01-27">27 Jan.</date> that the books, together with copies of Carlyle&#x2019;s recent articles (the &#x201C;Voltaire&#x201D; specifically) and John&#x2019;s own article on &#x201C;Animal Magnetism&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, be sent to him via the Hon. William Burrell, Florence.</note> My Letters, it appears, had all reached you but <hi rend="italic">one:</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written that he had now received three letters from Carlyle, the last one forwarded from Florence.</note> an unhappy one, conveying tidings which would knell solemnly against your heart, that our dear Father was no more. This last mournful Letter I wrote I think on the <date when="1832-01-25">25<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of January</date>; gave it to Jeffrey, to be by him forwarded thro&#x2019; the Foreign Office, as the Post had so often baulked me: and, as he did actually send it thither, probably enough it may be already in your hands. Lest new delays may have <pb id="pg-06-120" n="06:120"/>occurred, I repeat that doleful message, which was all it contained. Let me add too that the stroke was merciful every way; our dear Father had scarcely any sickness; died like a just man, as he had lived; and left nothing but holy remembrances behind him. For myself, so soon as the news reached me (on the <date when="1832-01-24">24<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>; the event had occurred on the morning of Sunday the <date when="1832-01-22">22<hi rend="italic">nd</hi></date>) I shut myself up from all business or worldly intrusion; and spent the remainder of the time till after the Funeral in solemn converse with the Departed: and, indeed, can now say that these days were the only Sabbath I have had since I came hither: pure, holy days, in which the Earth with its vanities seemed to lie under my feet, and the purified spirit of the Dead seem<supplied>[ed]</supplied> almost to live again in me, and thro&#x2019; Time I could see glimmerings of Eternity. If this, my dear Brother, is your first intimation of the event, I must again grieve for you; but will also bid you meet your grief in the spirit of meekness, and religious submission; we poor mortals <hi rend="italic">have</hi> no other armour. I wrote copiously twice to our Mother: a Letter has since come (only the other day) full of composure and peace: the survivors, our Mother in particular, are all well; and knit the closer for this breach among them: Jamie, it seems, as I had partly advised him, makes worship regularly in the household; Alick had promised to do the like in his: John of Cockermouth<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their older half-brother.</note> parted from them at Burnfoot, exhorting them with affectionate tears in his eyes to live all united as they had heretofore done, and mindful and worthy of the true man whose name they bore. Thus has the scene in mild solemnity closed.&#x2014; When the news first reached me, I sat silent some minutes, the word &#x201C;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C3; [The end]!&#x201D; pealing mournfully thro&#x2019; my heart; till at length tears and sobs gave me relief. Death has long been hourly present with me; I have long learned to look upon it as properly the beginning of Life: its dark curtain grows more and more transparent; the Departed I think are only hidden, they are still <hi rend="italic">here</hi>: both they and we, as I often repeat, &#x201C;are with God.&#x201D;&#x2014; I wrote down, in my Notebook, all that I could remember as remarkable about my Father;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >These were the notes which became the sketch of his father in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences,</hi> dated at the end &#x201C;Sunday night, <date when="1832-01-29">29th January 1832</date>.&#x201D;</note> his Life grew wonderfully clear to me, almost like the first stage of my own; I had great peace and satisfaction in thinking of him. Let us, in our wider sphere, live worthy of a Father so true and brave: hope too that in some inscrutable way an Eternal Reunion is appointed us, for &#x201C;with God nothing is impossible&#x201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 1:37.</note> at <pb id="pg-06-121" n="06:121"/>all events that &#x201C;He will do all things <hi rend="italic">well</hi>&#x201D;: therein lies the anchorage that <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> prove deceitful.&#x2014; And now let us live for the Living.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 174 and cf. p. 123. Carlyle echoes Goethe&#x2019;s &#x201C;Life belongs to the living&#x201D; in his translation of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXIV, 215. Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340722-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-07-22">22 July 1834</date></ref>, where Carlyle uses his mother&#x2019;s proverb to express a similar sentiment.</note></p>
<p>Your last Letter seemed to me the best I had ever got from you; perhaps among the best I had ever got from any one. There is so much heartiness and earnestness; the image of a mind honestly deeply labouring, in a healthy and genuine position towards Nature and Men. Continue in that right mood, strive unweariedly, and all that is yet wanting will be given you. I rejoice from the heart to see that the good augury I have always made and uttered of you is pointing decisively towards fulfilment. Go on, and prosper! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Klarheit, Reinheit; &#x201C;im Ganzen, Guten, wahren resolut zu leben</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [Clarity, purity; &#x201C;to live resolutely a whole, good, and true life&#x201D;]:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle alludes to the last two lines of the fifth stanza of Goethe&#x2019;s poem &#x201C;Generalbeichte&#x201D; (first published in <date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>): &#x201C;<foreign>Und in Ganzem, Guten, Sch&#xF6;nen, / Resolut zu leben</foreign>&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Goethes Werke</hi> [Weimar, <date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>], I, 127). He often quotes Goethe&#x2019;s lines in his works, usually (and significantly) substituting &#x201C;the True&#x201D; for &#x201C;the Beautiful.&#x201D; See, for example, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 173 and 384.</note> this is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that man wants on Earth; ever as of old &#x201C;the one thing needful.&#x201D; Well do I understand, my dear Brother, those thoughts of yours on the Pincian Hill:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written that the weather at Rome had been delightful and that he had found it &#x201C;not infrequently sultry in the sunshine of the Pincian hill where my chief walk lies.&#x201D; He refers to his lack of a friend, and then goes on: &#x201C;Take now the whole of this confused &#x26; somewhat tumultuous story &#x26; put it together with due coherency, &#x26; you shall have the best picture I can give you of my position at Rome&#x2014;truer even &#x26; more from the life for its very confusion. With the wreck of the greatest of cities before me &#x26; a pure sky above, earnest questions come upon me, in my solitary walks, calmly &#x26; strongly till they go through &#x2018;marrow &#x26; bone.&#x2019; I cannot answer them &#x26; they will obstruct &#x26; cross my path, now that they are once aroused, till I ascertain what is to be done with them, whether they really do admit of any answer with full assurance, or are rather to be thrown off &#x26; dismissed, if you can, without answer. Richters eyeless socket looking down upon him &#x26; echo answering to his longing invocations give some image of my condition at times.&#x201D; A passage in German and English follows, the substance of which is: Where does the world come from? Where does it go to? What governs it? Why am I here? What will become of me? How can a man get light? Tell me clearly what you think of such matters; for you must have come through them not without effort. I want no profession of faith from you, for that would be only dead letters for me. I demand guidance, if it is to be had. I feel a rich seed in my heart which no earthly power can tear out. By what process will it bring forth large and healthy fruit? Through what means will I be able to work free and unimpeded? (The passage echoes many questions in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>, which in its short form John had read in manuscript.) In referring to the &#x201C;eyeless socket,&#x201D; John had in mind a passage in ch. I of Richter&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Siebenk&#xE4;s</hi>, presumably as Carlyle had translated it and quoted it at length in his &#x201C;Jean Paul Friedrich Richter,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, V (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), 1&#x2013;52; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 157. It is a dream in which the dead cry out, &#x201C;Christ, is there no God?&#x201D; and he answers, &#x201C;There is none!&#x201D; Calling for his Father, Christ says that looking up to the &#x201C;immeasurable world for the Divine <hi rend="italic">Eye</hi>, it glared on me with an empty, black, bottomless <hi rend="italic">Eye-socket</hi>.&#x201D; Again the children cry, &#x201C;Jesus, have we no Father?&#x201D; and he replies, &#x201C;We are all orphans.&#x201D; Carlyle replies to John&#x2019;s reference to Richter by referring him to Goethe.</note> they <pb id="pg-06-122" n="06:122"/>tore my inward man in pieces for long years, and literally wellnigh put an end to my life; till by Heaven&#x2019;s great grace, I got the victory over them, nay changed them into precious everlasting possessions. I wish you could have read my Book at this time; for it turns precisely (in its way) on these very matters: in the Paper &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Characteristics</hi>&#x201D; also some of my lastest [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] experiences and insights are recorded; these I still hope you will soon see. Meanwhile be not for a moment discouraged, for the victory is <hi rend="italic">certain</hi>, if you desire it honestly: neither imagine that it is by <hi rend="italic">forgetting</hi> such high questions that you are to have them answered. Unless one is an animal they cannot be forgotten. This also, however, is true, that Logic will never resolve such things; the instinct of Logic is to <hi rend="italic">say No</hi>. Remember always that the deepest Truth, the truest of all, is actually &#x201C;unspeakable,&#x201D; cannot be argued of, dwells far below the region of articulate demonstration; it must be felt by trial and indubitable direct experience, then is it known once and forever. I wish I could have speech of you from time to time: perhaps I might disentangle some things for you: yet after all, the victory must be gained by <hi rend="italic">oneself: &#x201C;<foreign>Dir auch gelingt es Dich durchzuarbeiten</foreign></hi> [You are also succeeding in working your way through].&#x201D; I will here only mention a practical maxim or two which I have found of chief advantage, and can desire you to meditate upon intensely till they have acquired meaning for meaning they have in very deed, as you will find more and more. First I would have you know this: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Doubt</hi> of any sort can only be removed by <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>.&#x201D; But what to act on? you cry. I answer again in the words of Goethe: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> the Duty which liest nearest&#x201D;; Do it (not merely <hi rend="italic">pretend</hi> to have done it); the next Duty will already have become clear to thee.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both maxims are quoted in the chapter on &#x201C;The Everlasting Yea&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>. Both derive from Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> (see Carlyle&#x2019;s translation, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIII, 386; XXIV, 2).</note> There is great truth here; in fact it is my opinion that he who (by whatever means) has once seen into the <hi rend="italic">infinite</hi> nature of Duty, has seen all that costs difficulty: the universe has then become a Temple for him, and the Divinity and all the divine things thereof will infallibly become revealed. To the same purpose is this saying: <foreign><hi rend="italic">die hohe Bedeutung des 
<pb id="pg-06-123" n="06:123"/>Entsagens</hi></foreign> [the sublime meaning of renunciation]. Once understand <foreign><hi rend="italic">Entsagen</hi></foreign> [renunciation], then Life <foreign><hi rend="italic">eigentlich beginnt</hi></foreign> [actually begins].<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Another important concept and ideal in &#x201C;The Everlasting Yea,&#x201D; which is also in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> (Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 334).</note> You may also meditate on these words: &#x201C;the divine depth of <hi rend="italic">Sorrow</hi>&#x201D;; &#x201C;the Sanctuary of Sorrow&#x201D;:<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both phrases concerning sorrow are used in &#x201C;The Everlasting Yea&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, and both relate to concepts in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi>, chs. x and xi (Carlyle&#x2019;s translation, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 258&#x2013;78). The elders who instruct Meister take the life of Christ and his sufferings &#x201C;as a model of exalted patience,&#x201D; but from reverence they do not lightly expose them.</note> to me they have been full of significance.&#x2014; But on the whole, dear Brother, study to clear your heart from all selfish <hi rend="italic">Desire</hi>, that <hi rend="italic">Freewill</hi> may arise and reign absolute in you; true vision lies in thy <hi rend="italic">heart</hi>, it is by this that the <hi rend="italic">eye</hi> sees, or forever only <hi rend="italic">fancies</hi> that it sees. &#x201C;Do the Duty&#x201D; that lies there, clear, at hand!&#x2014; I must not spend your whole sheet in preaching, and will add only this other precept, which I find more important every day I live: Avoid all idle, <hi rend="italic">untrue</hi> Talk, as you would the Pestilence! It is the curse and all-deforming, all-choking Leprosy of these days.&#x2014;&#x2014; As for your medical relation I can see nothing in it but what is hopeful, praise-worthy. Here as everywhere, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">do</hi> your Duty,&#x201D; meekly, bravely: <hi rend="italic">be</hi> actually and in heart zealous to help the help-needing and to all appearance excellent person that looks to you for help, and assuredly you will help her. Is not genuine sympathy already the best help?<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;My patient seems to give me all confidence though her disease is one that I cannot do much to remove, only try to alleviate &#x26; render endurable so far as I can. It is indeed most difficult to get any hold of an ailment so evanescent so rapid &#x26; fierce &#x26; so complicated every way. Less than any other is such a disease imaginary. My patient has such force of resolution as I have seldom seen, &#x26; I never met with any person less disposed to complain unnecessarily. She bears without murmuring torture intense enough to change her countenance &#x26; make it show the agony she feels to a degree that I often find painful to look upon in my helplessness. &#x2026; My position with Lady C. is simple &#x26; clear &#x26; altogether without any burdensome ceremony.&#x201D;</note> For health of <hi rend="italic">mind</hi>, I have the clearest belief that there is none, except in this, which I have even now been inculcating on you: Action; <hi rend="italic">religious</hi> Action. If the mind is cultivated, and cannot take in Religion by the old vehicle, a new one must be striven after&#x2014;in this point of view, German Literature is quite priceless: I never cease to thank Heaven for such men as Richter, Schiller, Goethe; the latter especially was my Evangelist; his works if you study them with true earnestness are as the dayspring visiting us in the dark Night. Perhaps Lady Clare may profit much by them: only keep away all <hi rend="italic">Dilettantism</hi><supplied>[;]</supplied> sweep it out of being, this is no world for <pb id="pg-06-124" n="06:124"/>it, this is no Revelation of a world for it. Among Goethe&#x2019;s admirers here I find <hi rend="italic">no</hi> one possessed of almost the smallest feeling of what lies in him: they have eyes but see not,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Jer. 5:21; Ps. 115:5.</note> hearts but understand not; as indeed the whole world almost has. &#x201C;Let them go their way; do thou go thine.&#x201D; I have now done.&#x2014;</p>
<p>As for us here, we are making ready as fast as may be for getting home. The events in Annandale, as well as Jane&#x2019;s health (rather improving still, yet nowise right) induce us to resolve on going direct home by Liverpool: I will go to Edinburgh afterwards myself. If you write <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the middle of <date when="1832-03-00">March</date>, it will be safer to direct to Craigenputtoch<supplied>[.]</supplied> We are about hiring a servant (thro&#x2019; Mrs Welsh) to be ready for us on the <date when="1832-04-01">first of April</date>. We shall go to Annan and Scotsbrig first. Craigenp<hi rend="italic">h</hi> we understand to be deserted by Alick and his wife ere this; and Betty Smeal to be keeping it for us. Alick a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> Jenny had got some apartment in the Catlinns house, and were going thither at Candlemas. The Farm lies contiguous to Sloda-Hill (which you and I know); the manager of it is one of the Hillside Stewarts, the Proprietor &#x201C;an old Lady&#x201D;: this is all I have yet learned about it. Robert Clow is engaged as ploughman: I expect every day to hear from Alick, and have expected for some time. At Scotsbrig, I should have mentioned, all worldly concerns had been settled above a year before; and so occasioned no difficulty.&#x2014; The thing that chiefly occupies me at present is the writing of a Paper on <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>: it is mostly on paper, but confused; it is of the extemporaneous sort you have so often recommended: I mean to offer it to Fraser, having first written it not as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> likes, but as I like. One has no other resource. Lytton Bulwer (whom I have never met yet) is a Dandy, and his Publishers are Knaves, <hi rend="italic">nearly ruined</hi> too:<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Edward Bulwer edited the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi> from <date when="1831-11-00">Nov. 1831</date> to <date when="1833-08-00">Aug. 1833</date>, of which the publisher and proprietor was Henry Colburn. Bulwer was himself a Dandy, and his novel <hi rend="italic">Pelham</hi> (<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>) is associated with Dandyism.</note> Fraser&#x2019;s people, with the single exception of William Fraser, are wretched half-men little better, and even less esteemed, than Dandies; Fraser himself <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> tho&#x2019; wooden, perhaps the worthiest creature in the Trade here. So this is the way I have adjusted myself: I say, will <hi rend="italic">you</hi> on your Dog&#x2019;s carrion-cart take this &#x201C;Article&#x201D; of mine, and sell it <hi rend="italic">unchanged</hi>? With the Carrion-cart itself I have and can have no personal concern. For Fraser I am partly bound as to this piece on <hi rend="italic">Johnson:</hi> Bulwer if he want anything on similar terms, and I feel unoccupied, he shall have it; otherwise not.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-125" n="06:125"/>He <hi rend="italic">is</hi> Editor; and trumpeted abroad as such in a disgusting way. With <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi> I have done nothing more; and see not what I can, Trade being still utterly stagnant. Indeed, my theory begins to be that Bookselling is by and by to work itself into a quite new form, and is at present in the agonies of death-birth, as so much else is. If I see meet, I may perhaps slit up poor <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi> into Articles for Tait of Edinburgh, who is actually about getting out a radical Magazine<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320205-TC-WT-01">TC to WT, <date when="1832-02-05">5 Feb.</date></ref></note> and sounds vehement note of preparation. Poor Tait! he knows not what he does. For the present I have employment enough and to spare; even independent of Lardner (with whom I have not yet <hi rend="italic">signed</hi>, but am ready to do so, and indifferent whether or not) the whole summer is full. Napier seems to be on the best terms with me; has not altered a single letter of my last piece, and wholly behaves well. Even if neither Fraser nor Bulwer will take my <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> (some &#xa3;30 worth) I can carry it home with me, and still <hi rend="italic">do</hi>.&#x2014; As to the &#x201C;Characteristics,&#x201D; it has prospered better than I could have expected, and goes not without a response from various quarters: I have a separate copy of it here for you; and if the Foreign Office will take such a weight, mean to despatch it soon. William Fraser has power there, and volunteers for your sake and mine. I may mention finally a rather foolish thing: poor James Fraser came hither some two weeks ago to ask me if I would &#x201C;sit to his Artist&#x201D;:<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel Maclise (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>), Irish painter, who under the pseudonym of Alfred Croquis contributed a series of portrait sketches to <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">38</date>), republished as <hi rend="italic">The Maclise Portrait Gallery</hi> (<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>). The sketch of Carlyle was in a &#x201C;Gallery of Literary Characters,&#x201D; VII (<date when="1833-06-00">June 1833</date>), 706, and is reproduced by Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, I, frontispiece.

I dined at Magazine Fraser<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>s some five weeks ago: saw Lockhart, Galt, Cunningham, Hogg: G. has since sent me a Book (new, and worth little)<supplied>[;]</supplied> he is a broad <foreign>gawsie</foreign> Greenock man, old-growing, loveable with pity: L. a dandiacal not without force, but barren and unfruitful; Hogg utterly a singing <hi rend="italic">Goose</hi>, whom also I pitied and loved.

<p>Friday morning.&#x2014; I saw Irving yesternight, for the <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> time since you left us. He is still goodnatured and patient; but enveloped <pb id="pg-06-127" n="06:127"/>in the vain sound of the &#x201C;Tongues&#x201D;: I am glad to think that he will not go utterly <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> (not madder than a Don Quixote was); but his intellect seems quietly settling into a superstitious <foreign><hi rend="italic">caput mortuum;</hi></foreign> he has no longer any opinion to deliver worth listening to on any secular matter.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have got a Letter from the Doctor, and a Frank to hold it in; but unfortunately very little time to write myself: so you must take a <pb id="pg-06-129" n="06:129"/>short hasty word, rather than none. I wish I had more time, for I could speak gladly at great length; but I foresee many interruptions, and have already undergone some. My only chance is to make honest use of all the time I have: perhaps it may be better than I expect.</p>
<p>Jane&#x2019;s kind, calm Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> gave us great satisfaction: it was wholly in the spirit, and represented you all as wholly in the spirit which I wished and expected. Our sufferings here are not unmixed with mercy: nay, as faith teaches us, they are all mercies in disguise. My mind also is peaceable; and if sad, not, I trust, sad after an unholy fashion. Let us not mourn as creatures that had no Hope. We are creatures that had an All-Good Creator; and this Earth we live in is named &#x201C;the Place of Hope.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301010-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1830-10-10">10 Oct. 1830</date></ref>.</note> For myself Death has long been the hourly companion of my thoughts: I can look upon this earthly world as, in very deed, smoke and shadow; and Eternity the only substance, the only truth. Thus is &#x201C;Death, what mortals call Death, properly the beginning of Life.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320124-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1832-01-24">24 Jan.</date></ref></note> How any reasonable being can exist here below otherwise than this, might justly seem a mystery.&#x2014; I am also much gratified to learn that Jamie makes worship among you: nothing <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be more becoming and needful than in all our ways and days-works to address ourselves, as the beginning of every other effort, to Him who has given us our whole Force; by whom our whole efforts are overruled, in whom we live, move, and have our being.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Acts 17:28.</note> Tell Jamie that I take this as a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> token of him; and will hope all that is good and just and wise from his future conduct. Thank him for his kind and honest little Postscript; which I will answer, by the first opportunity; would fain answer <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. He must write me again, at any rate. Finally, my dear Mother, <hi rend="italic">take care of yourself;</hi> that we may find you well, when it shall please God to bring us together again.</p>
<p>You will see by Jack&#x2019;s Letter how it stands with him, and that all seems to be going on as one would wish it. I am much pleased with his Letter; I reckon it very reasonable and solid; perhaps the very best he ever wrote me. He had got all my Letters but <hi rend="italic">one:</hi> that one I expect may be in his hands about this time; and will bring a cloud over his sky. On him too I urged the Duty of not grieving, but <hi rend="italic">thinking,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">doing</hi>. I wrote again the day before yesterday; and shall perhaps get one other Letter before leaving London.</p>
<p>What <hi rend="italic">day</hi> we are to look forward to for setting out cannot yet be <pb id="pg-06-130" n="06:130"/>anywise fixed. I am in the middle of <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>, which I wish to finish before setting out; it will take me at least twelve days yet, pretty hard work. Then I have to settle about many other little things: Napier indeed wrote to me (today) about <hi rend="italic">another</hi> little Article for the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review to be ready &#x201C;about the middle of March&#x201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Napier wrote to Carlyle on <date when="1832-02-15">15 Feb.</date>, accepting Carlyle&#x2019;s proposal to write on Elliott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Corn Law Rhymes</hi> for the <date when="1832-04-00">April</date> issue of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>. He cautiously insisted, however, that the article be &#x201C;popular&#x201D; not &#x201C;doctrinal,&#x201D; adding, &#x201C;It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not do to have an article of any length on the productions of so obscure a Rhymer.&#x201D; It was probably Elliott&#x2019;s radicalism rather than his obscurity that made Napier cautious, since he had already been reviewed by the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum;</hi> and Lockhart&#x2019;s refusal to print anything about him in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi> was to lead to a break with Southey.</note> but this I rather think I shall try to write in Dumfriesshire,&#x2014;say to finish it at Scotsbrig! On the whole, nothing can be fixed: only you may take this fact: Jane is about writing to her Mother to engage a Servant she (Mrs Welsh) was speaking of, to be ready <hi rend="italic">by the <date when="1832-04-01">first of April</date></hi>; we mean also to stay some while with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, before looking at Dunscore. This fact also is certain: we are neither of us disposed <hi rend="italic">to lose any time;</hi> so the harder I work, the sooner I shall get into free air, and to the sight of dear Friends!&#x2014; We were both of us very thankful that you had despatched Betty Smeal to keep the house of Puttoch: it makes us quite easy on that score; and Betty can be figured there as bolting and barring and burning fires, and keeping everything as it should be.&#x2014; We cannot yet make out what Alick is specially doing; for he has never written: probably he is too busy with beginning his new enterprise; at all events I should like to know <hi rend="italic">where</hi> he is, were it only for sending the Paper to him. By the way, it did not come this morning; but I reckon, that means <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>.</p>
<p>We have Cholera at last in this city, as you will see: such has been my expectation ever since I first heard of the disease. The people affected hitherto are few in number (perhaps not above the <hi rend="italic">usual</hi> number of deaths) and far off this quarter of the city. I myself feel no alarm, nor does Jane: when they told me that day, &#x201C;Cholera is here! Cholera is here!&#x201D;&#x2014;I answered: &#x201C;When was Death <hi rend="italic">not</hi> here?&#x201D;&#x2014; Far would it be from me to expose myself without strict necessity; I would even fly were the danger considered in any measure pressing, and did one know <hi rend="italic">whither</hi> to fly (but which place is safe, or even much safer than another?). At the same time, equally far should I wish to be from pusillanimous terror&#x2014;as if in the midst of the pestilence, as in the midst of health, I were not <hi rend="italic">in God&#x2019;s hand</hi>.&#x2014; The truth is this &#x201C;Cholera&#x201D; is little else, if one look at it, than an opening of <pb id="pg-06-131" n="06:131"/>men&#x2019;s eyes to behold what their usual blindness prevents them from observing: that their Life hangs by a single hair; that Death is <hi rend="italic">great</hi>, and forever <hi rend="italic">close</hi> at their hand. By a singular arrangement, too, this Disease seems to attack almost exclusively, not so much the poor, as the improvident, drunken and worthless: punishment follows hard on sin.&#x2014; They are passing Acts of Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> about it; for having the Poor clothed and fed, by assessment, where it is not done voluntarily. This is very right. If the Disease spread and become threatening, you shall instantly hear; and, in this case, may see us sooner than you expect, for we have nothing to detain us here, at any <hi rend="italic">risk</hi>. But for the present, there seems none that we can calculate: so be not uneasy, dear Mother; commit us to God&#x2019;s good keeping, as we I hope endeavour to do ourselves; and fear nothing.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane has a headache today; but considers herself, on the whole, and indeed evidently is, in an improving way, &#x201C;decidedly better than she was.&#x201D; She has had but a sickly time of it here, yet has not been unhappy, &#x201C;there is such excellent company.&#x201D; She has seen no &#x201C;sights&#x201D; hardly; and cares little or nothing about such. Good talk is what she delights in, and I too; and here, amid the mass of Stupidity and Falsehood, there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> actually some reasonable conversation to be come at. She has met with some valuable people; and I believe has improved herself in more ways than one. Mrs Austin and she are very fond of each other; Jane is going up to her, on Thursday, &#x201C;to have a whole day of it&#x201D;: I also think Mrs A. a very worthy solid-minded woman.&#x2014; Mrs Strachey I have never seen yet; having been so busy, and also not knowing whether she liked to see any one. I hear that she conducts herself with great propriety. The Bullers have been here, and were exceedingly kind about me: they have all left town (except Arthur, who is here studying Law); being obliged to it by the state of Charles&#x2019;s health, which indeed is far from satisfactory. He seems to have a decided tendency to Asthma, and is ever and anon violently attacked: so that they are much afraid he will be forced to give up his Law profession altogether. He is, in mind and character, a really promising young man.</p>
<p>Of Literary people I might see enough, did I care for seeing them. My own footing in the fraternity is quite satisfactory to me; and that is all I have to do with: for, as to the rest, &#x201C;they go their way, and I go mine.&#x201D; A wholly miserable Brotherhood; of whom one can say nothing, except it were a prayer for them. Of Work, as I told you, I have plenty and to spare. This <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> is meant for Fraser (an honest, ignorant, simpleton of a creature, knowing little but that one <pb id="pg-06-132" n="06:132"/>and one make two): but if it do not suit his Magazine, I have other use for it. I must also tell you another thing: Fraser came to me the other morning, and, by Jane&#x2019;s help, got me to &#x201C;stand for my Picture,&#x201D; to be published in his Magazine! I suppose it will not be out for several Months: however, you need not be impatient; for I do not think it at all <hi rend="italic">like</hi> me, except in the coat and boots, and hair of the head. Goethe&#x2019;s Picture is to appear in the next Number (of that <hi rend="italic">dud</hi> Magazine); and I have been requested (just as I was beginning this Letter) to write a little Notice<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Baron von Goethe,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, V (<date when="1832-03-00">March 1832</date>), 206; reprinted as &#x201C;Goethe&#x2019;s Portrait&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays, Works</hi>, XXVII, 371&#x2013;73. Carlyle&#x2019;s note on the portrait, written for the essay when reprinted, reads: &#x201C;By Stieler of Munich: the copy in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> proved a total failure and involuntary caricature,&#x2014;resembling, as was said at the time, a wretched old clothesman carrying behind his back a hat which he seemed to have stolen.&#x201D;</note> to accompany it; which perhaps I should consent to do.&#x2014; The &#x201C;Characteristics&#x201D; have been well received; approved seemingly by every one whose approval was wanted: I am on all hands encouraged to proceed. Forward! Forward!</p>
<p>Meeting Irving the other day on the street, he appointed me to come and take tea with him. The &#x201C;inspired-tongue&#x201D; work, I think, is getting a little dulled; at least I heard or saw nothing of it going on, that night; only Irving still full of its importance, and his Wife (a melancholic half-hollow sort of person, not wholly to my mind) still fuller. Irving had read the &#x201C;Characteristics,&#x201D; with quite <hi rend="italic">high</hi> estimation of the <hi rend="italic">talent</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c: nevertheless he seemed to think I was going a very wrong road to work, and should consider myself, and take into the &#x201C;Tongues.&#x201D; He was nobly tolerant in heart; but in head quite bewildered, almost imbecile. He put into my hands, as &#x201C;the deepest view he had ever seen&#x201D; a Paper (in his Prophetic Magazine &#x201C;the Morning Watch&#x201D;) written by a namesake of mine<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Carlyle (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>), from Dumfriesshire, attended Annan Academy and Edinburgh University, and was admitted to the Scottish Bar in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>. His chief interest, however, was theology. He remained faithful to Irving after his expulsion from the Established Church and became one of the new group&#x2019;s elected &#x201C;apostles.&#x201D; He wrote to Carlyle once, on <date when="1838-08-20">20 Aug. 1838</date>. Carlyle wrote of him, in <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330827-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-08-27">27 Aug. 1833</date></ref>, after his arrest for street-preaching in Edinburgh: &#x201C;I fear the poor young man will not be long out of Bedlam. Sad is the case!&#x201D; He died at Albury, and his collected theological writings were published in <date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>. Carlyle usually writes about him scathingly. See F. Kr&#xE4;mer, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Carlyle of the Scottish Bar</hi> (Freiburg, <date when="1966-00-00">1966</date>).</note> in Edinburgh, or rather <hi rend="italic">not</hi> by him, &#x201C;for it was given him&#x201D;&#x2014;by the spirit! This deepest view I glanced into, and found to be simply the insanest Babble, without top bottom or centre, that ever was emitted even from Bedlam <pb id="pg-06-133" n="06:133"/>itself.&#x2014; Poor Irving! It is still said they are taking steps to cast him out of his Church: what next he is to bring out upon the world I cannot prophecy. A good truehearted man he will continue; the truer, the more he suffers from the world: but he has once for all surrounded himself with Delirium, and with the Delirious; and so stands quite exiled from all general usefulness. Nevertheless <supplied>[if]</supplied> he be spared <hi rend="italic">alive</hi>, he is nowise <hi rend="italic">done</hi> yet; but has other outbreakings in store.</p>
<p>I have now, my Dear Mother, contrary to expectation written you even a long Letter: and may with good grace draw bridle. I think perhaps the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> Letter you get will be to tell you what day or at least week we are coming home! Jamie will come and meet us at Annan with the Gig, for that is the route we take. In Liverpool we do not mean to stop above four and twenty hours: less if we can manage with less. Neither in London will we linger a day after our <hi rend="italic">work</hi> is done, or lose a day in the doing of it.&#x2014; And now, Dear Mother, take our united filial love; and let us all be joined together more and more in true affection, and in <hi rend="italic">well-doing</hi> above all, which is the only bond and basis of affection between reasonable beings. Let us live in thankfulness towards the good Disposer of events, faithfully striving to serve Him, as He gives us strength: then what is there that can make us afraid?&#x2014; Be very careful of your health, for the sake of us all. God bless and keep every one of you!</p>

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I know not accurately where you are at present; except conjecturing that <hi rend="italic">you are not</hi> at Craigenputtoch: but send you by way of Scotsbrig a little Note to tell you of my continued remembrance, and excite you to give me forthwith some more precise tidings. I am transmitting to our Mother a Letter from Rome; of which doubtless you also will by and by get sight: so for the present I mention only that poor Jack writes more and more like a sensible man; is well every way, and seems to be every way doing well. I sent him, in answer to <pb id="pg-06-134" n="06:134"/>his questions, all the news I had about you; and hope I shall soon have more.</p>
<p>Jane (of Scotsbrig) said you had promised to write to me: why do you not? I hope, it is only the pressure of Business that hinders you, and that no new evil has befallen. We must not get <hi rend="italic">parted</hi>; tho&#x2019; the one is to be in Nithsdale and the other in Annandale; least of all now when the Head of our Household has been taken from us, and each of those that are left ought to be dearer and closer to the rest.</p>
<p>We are coming home, as was already said, as early as possible in the month of <date when="1832-03-00">March</date>. We are busy, very busy; and in our usual health; Jane, tho&#x2019; still complaining, rather <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than she has long been: I do not think she is to be <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> again, till she have got into her <hi rend="italic">home</hi>, and native air; which of course will quicken our motions the more.</p>
<p>We have both of us determined to take <hi rend="italic">better</hi> care of our health, were we once home again: I feel it to be a real point of <hi rend="italic">duty</hi>; were it only for the greater quantity and better quality of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> which good health enables you to do. We are also minded to try if we cannot be a little more <hi rend="italic">domesticated</hi> among the moors at Puttoch; to take a greater interest in the people there (who are all immortal creatures, however poor and defaced); and to feel as if the place were a <hi rend="italic">home</hi> for us. Such as it is, I feel it a great blessing that we have it to go to. For the whole Summer and onwards to winter, I already see plenty of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> before me: how we turn ourselves afterwards, need not yet be decided on.</p>
<p>Under the &#x201C;health&#x201D; point of view, it sometimes strikes me as a pity that I had not a horse to ride on, one for myself (for Jane too I will make <hi rend="italic">ride</hi>, as the wholesomest medicine I know); and one that would carry me more <hi rend="italic">sharply</hi> than Harry can. Thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">Summer</hi>, I could keep a creature of the kind without any expence: in winter again I should not like to be troubled with it. Thus it stands. As yet, however, I can see no clear light thro&#x2019; it; and have no precise instructions or request to communicate on the matter. Merely, you can think of it, till we meet; and perhaps have some counsel for me then. I do not so much as know (till we see farther) whether I shall quite conveniently have money enough to spend in buying a Horse for the Summer<supplied>[;]</supplied> neither indeed is the whole business of essential mom<supplied>[ent.]</supplied></p>
<p>I was very glad to learn that you had promised to my Mother to keep up Religion in your house: without religion constantly present in the heart, I see not how a man can <hi rend="italic">live</hi>, otherwise than unreasonably, than <hi rend="italic">desperately</hi>. I have another advice to give you, my dear Brother; which I shall enforce with brotherly earnestness when we meet: It is <pb id="pg-06-135" n="06:135"/>to cultivate, in all things, the virtue of <hi rend="small-caps">Punctuality</hi>. There is far more in this than you suspect. To the want of Punctuality, I trace most part of all the evil I have seen in you. I think you do really in heart wish to be a good man, &#x201C;as the one thing needful&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 10:42.</note> also that you will more and more &#x201C;lay aside <hi rend="italic">every</hi> weight,&#x201D; and <hi rend="italic">be</hi> found running the race faithfully, for the true and only prize of Manhood.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 12:1.</note> This is my hope and trust of you, dear Brother: God turn it (for both of us) more and more into fulfilment!&#x2014; Write soon, then: give our kindest wishes to Jenny, and little Jean<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Little Jane Welsh Carlyle, daughter of Alexander and Jenny (Janet)</note>: <closer><salute>believe me ever your faithfully affectionate Brother&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I stay at home daily (scribbling) till after two o&#x2019;clock; and shall be truly glad, <hi rend="italic">any</hi> morning, to meet in person a man whom I have long, in spirit, seen and esteemed.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After waiting almost two weeks to answer Carlyle&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1832-02-08">8 Feb.</date>, Hunt had written: &#x201C;It was not I that sent you the book, but it was sent <hi rend="italic">at my request</hi>; &#x26; I notice this difference, merely to account in part for the delay in answering your communication, which did not come to me first. The rest has been occasioned by a conspiracy of petty obstacles, which I sometimes erroneously suffer to hinder me from doing what I wish, precisely because I wish it to be done in the best &#x26; most attentive manner,&#x2014;and after all it shall have nothing to shew for itself!&#x2014; Your note gratified me very much, especially as I had long been desirous of personally knowing you, and thanking you, among other things, for enabling me to become acquainted with Wilhelm Meister. I shall take my chance of finding you at home some day this week, about noon; and venture to hope, that I may by &#x26; by see you at a new abode into which I move tomorrow morning,&#x2014;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 5. York Buildings, New Road.&#x201D; (MS: Luther A. Brewer Collection, State University of Iowa; pbd: Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH</hi>, XLV, 440&#x2013;41). The book Hunt refers to was his <hi rend="italic">Christianism; or Belief and Unbelief Reconciled</hi>.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-136" n="06:136"/>Both my Wife and I, however, would reckon it a still greater favour, could you come at once in the evening, and take tea with us; that our interview might be the longer and freer. Might we expect you, for instance, on Wednesday night?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is writing on Monday.</note> Our hour is six o&#x2019;clock but we will alter it in any way to suit you.</p>
<p>We venture to make this proposal, because our stay in Town is now likely to be short, and we should be sorry to miss having free speech with you.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Believe me, / Dear Sir, / Very sincerely yours /</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle.</name><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt replied the next day: &#x201C;The invitation which M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle and yourself have been good enough to send me, is just the one that suits &#x26; pleases me best, and I shall be with you, at the hour you mention, tomorrow evening. In fact, you cannot conceive how much it has gratified me; for since the death of some dear friends, I have lived almost entirely out of the pale of intellectual acquaintance,&#x2014;a toiling solitary; and with the spring, many unlooked-for comforts seem to await me, of which this is one.&#x201D; (MS: NLS, 665.35; pbd: Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH,</hi> XLV, 442.) The evidence indicates that the first meeting of Hunt with the Carlyles took place at 4 Ampton Street on the evening of Wednesday, <date when="1832-02-22">22 February</date>. The meeting seems to have pleased everyone who was there, and soon the Carlyles met Marianne (Mrs. Hunt) and there was visiting back and forth (see Hunt&#x2019;s letters to Carlyle of <date when="1832-03-01">1 March</date> and <date when="1832-03-03">3 March</date> in Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH,</hi> XLV, 442&#x2013;43). Mrs. Hunt was much older than Jane Carlyle, and there was little else to make the two congenial; but in this period they at least made an effort to become good friends. An entry in Carlyle&#x2019;s journal for this month provides an early pen portrait of Hunt: &#x201C;A pleasant, innocent, ingenious man; filled with <hi rend="italic">Epicurean Philosophy,</hi> and steeped in it to the very heart.

<p>I return your Esher<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt&#x2019;s novel <hi rend="italic">Sir Ralph Esher; or, memoirs of a gentleman of the Court of Charles II</hi> appeared anonymously in three volumes in <date when="1832-01-00">January 1832</date>.

<p>You will not include this among those &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">compliments on your Husbands talents</hi>&#x201D; for which you express such mortal aversion (justly, for nothing can be more nauseous) But if I like the book and the writer of it (and I do, with my whole heart) and if I feel pleasure in saying I like them (and that I do also) I may say it, may I not, with impunity?&#x2014; At all rates I am not afraid of consequences</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Not having time to come over today, I write without loss of time, lest some mistake occur in the interim.</p>
<p>It were in the highest degree unreasonable did I object, by word or thought, to the rules you have laid down for paying your Magazine Contributions; or wish you to alter these rules against your own wish or interest for my sake. I hope you will understand once for all that no such feeling has or will have place with me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1832-03-03">3 March</date> Fraser had written to Carlyle: &#x201C;It was on the <date when="1831-12-20">20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of Dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date> when we had a conversation about the rate of payment&#x2014; I then offered you 15 Guineas per sheet for all your accepted papers. Your note of to-day intimates that it was 1 &#xa3; per page &#x26; that equal to the Foreign Review page.&#x2014; The difference between 15 Guineas &#x26; 16&#xa3;, being so trifling I immediately accede to the latter but I can only calculate by the pages of the Magazine &#x26; not of the late Review&#x2014;&#x201D;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-138" n="06:138"/>On the other hand, it were extremely unwise, if I too had not rules for my guidance, and did not walk by them. Allow me with all clearness, as one plain-spoken man to another, to explain in few words my position towards you.</p>
<p>Besides your Magazine there are <hi rend="italic">four</hi> other Publications, of perfect respectability, from which I have at this time applications for Contributions: the <hi rend="italic">lowest</hi> offer any of these makes is the one I have proposed to you: two of them (<hi rend="italic">one</hi> as I have <hi rend="italic">experienced</hi>) are between a fourth and a fifth part <hi rend="italic">higher</hi>. To your Magazine I have no particular attraction; it is much like others to me; much of its <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi> I can approve of, much of its tone and execution and practical speculation I must disapprove of: on the other hand <hi rend="italic">your</hi> personal character (allow me to say this, with the same sincerity) being, as I think, that of a thoroughly punctual, honest and even religious-principled man (almost a Phoenix in your Trade, I fear!) is of that sort with which I should decidedly <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to do business. So that on the whole <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> (more especially as to this <hi rend="italic">Johnson,</hi> the Books &#x26;c having come from you) is a vehicle I should as soon select as one of the others.</p>
<p>To few or perhaps none of these Publications can I heartily write myself; but I can say to any of them: Here is a Paper which I have written according to my <hi rend="italic">own belief,</hi> and notions of <hi rend="italic">honest writing</hi>; will you buy it or not? If so, then well: if not, then also well.</p>
<p>Hereby, my dear Sir, you will perceive how the matter stands. If you do not like the Essay on Johnson on those terms, which I mentioned, which are the lowest I <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> wrote for (except those scraps of mine you already had), and certainly the lowest I have any need or disposition to write for at present,&#x2014;then be so good as <hi rend="italic">return me the Papers without delay;</hi> I will settle with you for any damage I may have done your <hi rend="italic">Croker,</hi> and neither of us will respect the other less for this arrangement or misarrangement. Hoping to hear of you tomorrow, or get back the Papers (for I must be <hi rend="italic">speedy</hi> in settling about them),</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>This goes off so as to reach Ecclefechan on Sabbath day; at all events you will find it lying for you on Monday, when I hope you are already warned to call. I calculated on being able then to give you more precise directions than now turn out to be possible: however, we will make the best of it; and may still contrive to get thro&#x2019;.</p>
<p>We were all ready for decamping last night; but found on visiting the Coach-Offices that there was no room, of the sort we wanted: so I engaged two seats, an inside and an outside, for Saturday (tomorrow morning); by which accordingly we hope to set forth about eight of <pb id="pg-06-140" n="06:140"/>the clock, and reach Birmingham by seven in the Evening. It is so arranged that we are to sleep there; and then go on next morning at half-past six to Liverpool (another 100 miles): after which our course is not so clear; but may still be pretty accurately guessed at. According to our best recollection, and best inquiry here, the Annan Steamboat seems to sail from Liverpool on Monday, and reach Whinnyrig on Tuesday; in which case we shall do very well, and you may set off with confidence to meet us in the morning. If it come <hi rend="italic">after</hi> Monday, we shall likewise do well enough: and indeed, if <hi rend="italic">you know</hi> what day and hour (after Monday Night) it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> that the Steamboat reaches Annan at, you are quite safe to yoke the Gig and come rolling down for us, and get us disembarked, and carried home. We have three trunks (and a good barrel, we <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>&#x2014;for it is gone a week ago): but these cannot all come in the vehicle; so you may just leave out the gig-box, and we will do what we can. If you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> the time of the Steamboat, therefore, or can directly learn it, the whole will be right.</p>
<p>But if you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> know, what then is to be done? I meant to write from Liverpool, and say distinctly: but now, you see, it is impossible; for I do not think that we arrive at Liverpool on Sunday-night <hi rend="italic">in time</hi> for the Post; so that till Tuesday Morning (The Liverpool post of <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi>-Night), you could not possibly hear from us. Again, therefore, the question comes upon us: What, supposing you to know or learn nothing about the Annan Steamboat, are we to do or attempt?</p>
<p>This, it seems to me. Do you have the Gig &#x26;c in perfect readiness on Tuesday morning; yet keep it unyoked, till you have despatched a messenger once more to the Post-office (is it not somewhere about 9 o&#x2019;clock in the morning that the Mail comes from Carlisle?): there you shall have some sort of thing, Letter or Newspaper, on which the day and hour will stand indicated; and your whole course will then be clear. If your Post-hour is 9 or so, there will be no inconvenience suffered at all, most probably: in any case, it is but our waiting a few hours about Annan (Ben Nelson&#x2019;s, probably enough), and then finding you, let us hope, all well to welcome us. Thus let it be settled.</p>
<p>We have pretty weather for these three days, and hope to get along with average comfort. Jane is not at all so stout as beseems a Traveller: however, we must be <foreign>canny</foreign> with her: she has been crying out for <hi rend="italic">Buttermilk</hi> these many weeks: I tell her she shall have quite a gush of it at Scotsbrig. I too am glad enough to revisit the free air; tho&#x2019; not specially complaining.</p>
<p>Tell my Mother that we shall have a smoke together, and a talk, and bless God that he has still left us so much to rejoice over. I must <pb id="pg-06-141" n="06:141"/>begin writing again the instant I set foot on land. A copy of what I said on <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> I have kept for the special use of Scotsbrig.</p>
<p>There came a Letter from Jack some ten days ago: it was all right and well, but contained no news; nothing worth the trouble of a frank, at that time of near departure.</p>
<p>The Cholera is said to be declining here; some assert, to be quite departing. The Heavens have been merciful to us: as for the Earth the less one says the better. Such stupidity as these London <hi rend="italic">Boards of Health</hi> have manifested you might search the whole records of the world to match.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to boards of health responsible for precautions against cholera and the treatment of it. They issued statistics about it, given daily in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> which also included numerous letters of criticism.</note> The poor men, indeed, are compounds of the Knave and Blockhead, and there is the end of it.</p>
<p>We have settled all things comfortably here: are glad to have come to London, and glad to leave it. How much has been gained and lost; how much will come and go in six months of Time! Let us live here not as fools but as wise <hi rend="italic">redeeming</hi> the Time!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Col. 4:5.</note> There is no other refuge in this fearful and wonderful world; under which lies black Darkness, yet over which a God rules.</p>
<p>Give my love and Jane&#x2019;s to all the kind hearts that rejoice in our approach to Scotsbrig. All blessings be with them till we meet, and forever.</p>
<p>I have given direction enough above, and need not write more words. Let us see you then!&#x2014;&#x2014; <name>[Signature has been cut out]</name></p>

We had come home, last days of previous <date when="1832-03-00">March</date>: wild journey by heavy Coach, I outside, to Liverpool: to Birmingham it was good, and Inn there good; but next day (a Sunday, I think) we were quite overloaded; and had our adventures, especially on the street in Liverpool, rescuing our luggage after dark. But at Uncle John&#x2019;s, again, in Maryland Street, all became so bright. At mid-day, somewhere, we dined pleasantly <foreign><hi rend="italic">t&#xEA;te-&#xE0;-t&#xEA;te,</hi></foreign>&#x2014;in the belly of the Coach, from my Dear One&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">stores</hi> (to save expense doubtless), but the rest of the day had been unpleasantly chaotic even to me,&#x2014;though from her, as usual, there was nothing but patient goodness. Our dinners at Maryland Street I still remember, our days generally as pleasant,&#x2014;our departure in the Annan Steamer; a bright sunshiny forenoon, Uncle etc. zealously helping and escorting; sick, sick my poor woman must have been; but she retired out of sight, and would suffer with her best grace in silence:&#x2014;ah me, I recollect now a tight, clean, brandy-barrel she had bought; to &#x2018;hold such quantities of luggage, and be a water-barrel, for the rain at Craigenputtock!&#x2019;&#x2014;how touching to me at this moment!&#x2014; And an excellent water-barrel it proved; the purest <hi rend="italic">tea</hi> I ever tasted, made from the rain it stored for us.&#x2014; At Whinnyrigg, I remember, Brother Alick and others of them were waiting to receive us: there were <hi rend="italic">tears</hi> among us (my Father gone, while <hi rend="italic">we</hi> returned); <hi rend="italic">she</hi> wept bitterly, I recollect,&#x2014;her sympathetic heart girdled in much sickness and dispiritment of her own withal: but my Mother was very kind and cordially good and respectful to her always.

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Your little Mare carried us up very handsomely, and with wonderful spirit (especially the last half of the journey) considering how she has been worked of late. We gave ourselves and her rather a long rest at Dumfries; and got here, all safe and sound, about 8 o&#x2019;clock.</p>
<p>I have nothing but a miserable squirt of a crow-pen to write with; so must make the fewest words possible serve.</p>
<p>We called at both Post-Offices, and found news at both: at Ecclefechan, that Carlisle Letter, the purport of which my Mother can explain to you: at Dumfries, among other things, a Letter from Jack, which you will read as I have done with satisfaction at the poor Doctor&#x2019;s welfare. Naples, where he probably now is,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written in his letter of <date when="1832-03-12">12 March</date> that Lady Clare planned to leave Rome on <date when="1832-03-16">16 March</date> to seek a healthier climate at Naples.</note> lies south of Rome, in the finest climate and situation of any city in Europe; Mount Vesuvius, a fine <hi rend="italic">shew,</hi> but not dangerous, burns or smokes within sight of it: there will be already summer there.</p>
<p>In regard to the Carlisle Letter tell my Mother that I will write forthwith to the man to send up his five shillings to Postie at Ecclefechan; in whose hands she will probably find it about Wednesday first, and can get it, and buy tea with it.</p>
<p>At Dumfries, besides Jack&#x2019;s, there was another Letter (from Fraser, the Magazine man) bringing the mournful tidings that Goethe was no more.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had died on <date when="1832-03-22">22 March</date>. Carlyle wrote in his journal under a clipping from the London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> for <date when="1832-04-02">2 April</date> announcing Goethe&#x2019;s death: &#x201C;This came to me at Dumfries, on my first return thither. I had written to Weimar, asking for a Letter to welcome me home; and <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was it. My Letter would never reach its <hi rend="italic">address:</hi> the great and good Friend was no longer <hi rend="italic">there;</hi> had departed some seven days before.&#x2014;Craigenputtoch, <date when="1832-04-19">19th April, 1832</date>&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Two Note Books,</hi> p. 260). Carlyle&#x2019;s last letter to Goethe has not been found.</note> Alas! Alas! I feel as if I had a second time lost a Father: he was to me a kind of spiritual Father. The world holds not his like within it. But it is appointed for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> &#x2018;once to die.&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heb. 9:27.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-144" n="06:144"/>We saw Shaw,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Johan Shaw, the Dumfries cobbler at 65 Queensberry St.; but more likely a relation by marriage. Mary, the sister of Carlyle&#x2019;s mother, had married a Shaw. She had died in <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>, but he could have been alive in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>.</note> and delivered him Jane&#x2019;s Letter; but there was no sort of answer, I think; none that I heard of. He looked rather <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> to see us; and both sides had to confess not without emotion that much had come and gone since our former meeting. <hi rend="small-caps">Time</hi>, the all-devouring!</p>
<p>But now to our small daily matters. We got a gardener (name forgotten), who is to be upon the ground carrying a spade over his shoulder on Monday morning: a decent-looking man, brought to us by Shaw. Some messenger is in the interim to be despatched to Betty Smeal with warning and <hi rend="italic">help,</hi> both of victual and cash. One or both of ourselves must go over as soon as possible to see with our own eyes. In regard to this garden matter also, say to my Mother that the Potatoes will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be needed: there is some seed for us here.</p>
<p>Where I am to lodge or how to move for the next week, I cannot yet with any certainty predict; probably I shall be here most part of it; possibly we may have taken up quarters by the end of it at our own fireside: at all events, it is not unlikely that I may contrive to see <hi rend="italic">you</hi> there when you come up for the pigs: if the Sunday is good weather, it might perhaps be permitted me to ride over on such an errand. But it is all, as you see, unfixed, fluctuating: one thing only you can look upon as certain; that after Monday morning I am to be figured <hi rend="italic">sitting at my work</hi>. Either here or elsewhere I will have a private apartment, and set to: so have I decided it. In some two weeks, I shall be done with this little Job:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His &#x201C;Corn-Law Rhymes.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320408-TC-MN-01">TC to MN, <date when="1832-04-08">8 April</date></ref>.</note> then I am my own master again, and mean to make a sally into Annandale, and see you all with more deliberation. Perhaps in some three weeks; if Harry get any sort of mettle into him. There is much to be said and considered about the new state our whole Brotherhood is thrown into, now that our Head is gone. Meanwhile, let us all strive, by God&#x2019;s grace, to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> our parts, each for himself, bearing and forbearing, they that are strong helping them that are weak. O let us all be gentle, obedient, lovi<supplied>[ng]</supplied> to our Mother; now that she is left wholly to our charge! &#x2018;Honour thy Father and <supplied>[Mo]</supplied>ther&#x2019;:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Exod. 20:12.</note> doubly honour thy Mother when she alone remains.</p>
<p>Tell Jane (for she is my only Scotsbrig <hi rend="italic">writer</hi>) that she may send on <supplied>[the]</supplied> Dumfries Paper directed &#x2018;Craigenputtoch&#x2019; (for the Dumfries Postmaster has orders to forward it hither); and perhaps on Wednesday <pb id="pg-06-145" n="06:145"/>they will find one from me: or say, on Thursday, and then it will be certain.</p>
<p>Bid our dear Mother take care of herself: if you have any time, write me a single line to say whether she is better again; for we left her complaining. T<supplied>[ell her]</supplied> that she is to hold fast her trust in the Great Father, and no evil will befal her <supplied>[or]</supplied> hers.</p>
<p>I have now surely scribbled enough: but indeed my crow-pen grows strangely better by use. Our Post-Office address even <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> is, as I said: Craigenputtoch. I will still hope to see you about the end of the week. At all events so soon as this little turn of work is <hi rend="italic">turned off</hi>.&#x2014; Jane bids me send one and all her kindest affection: her Mother is delighted with the swine-heads (she says), and finds one of them the express image of a Dr Russell<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. James Russell, whose wife Mary became one of Jane Carlyle&#x2019;s best friends. He was an excellent physician, highly valued by Jane in her last years. See J. M. Sloan, <hi rend="italic">The Carlyle Country</hi> (London, <date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>), pp. 225&#x2013;28.</note> here.</p>
<p>Jamie knows all that I could say about the Crowdieknow Pony: you and he can act accordingly. I trust your little Black will not take harm by this expedition: Charlie has been appointed to take it home, the Boy not having <hi rend="italic">gumption</hi> enough: I charged him to use it with all gentleness.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>As I affect now and then to pride myself on punctuality, it is no small mortification to be so palpably behind time in that little tacit <pb id="pg-06-146" n="06:146"/>engagement with you about the Cornlaw Rhymer. I was detained in London two weeks beyond my <supplied>[calc]</supplied>ulation; and have been <hi rend="italic">travelling</hi> ever since yesterday gone a fortnight!</p>
<p>One thing, however, I have now resolved upon: I sit down here tomorrow morning at my desk, and stir not from it till my piece of work is completed: so that, on this day two weeks, if you have still room for some twelve or fourteen pages on the Sheffield Radical,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ebenezer Elliott.</note> they shall be ready for you; if not they will wait till next Number; and in any case my conscience is relieved. I write to inform you of this; and that the Address is once more &#x201C;Craigenputtoch, Dumfries,&#x201D; as of old.</p>
<p>The death of Goethe, which I heard of last night, is for me a very sad and great event. Not to be mourned over, but to be viewed with reverence, with solemn awe. &#x201C;How beautifully sinks that summer sun! So dies a Hero; glorious; to be worshipped!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This was expanded by Carlyle in the &#x201C;Death of Goethe,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi>, XXXIV (<date when="1832-06-00">June 1832</date>), 507&#x2013;12. As revised in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 375, it reads: &#x201C;Beautifully rose our summer sun, gorgeous in the red fervid east, scattering the spectres and sickly damps (of both of which there were enough to scatter); strong, benignant in his noonday clearness, walking triumphant through the upper realms; and now, mark also how he sets! &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">So stirbt ein Held; anbetungsvoll</hi></foreign>, So dies a hero; sight to be worshipped!&#x2019;&#x201D; Cf.

<dateline><place>Craigenputtoch</place>, Tuesday Night [<date when="1832-04-17">17 April 1832</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Mary was very urgent with me to write you a word or two; and now when at the eleventh hour I set about complying, I find my hand in such a state that I dare promise it will puzzle all Scotsbrig to read <pb id="pg-06-147" n="06:147"/>me. I have been rooting out docks, and otherwise resolutely working all afternoon: hence this trembling and <foreign>quirling</foreign> [whirling] which astonishes even myself.</p>
<p>However, I have still steadiness left to assure you in writing, what Mary will state in speech, that we are here safe, and as well as usual; only in the midst of natural hubbub, all things lying &#x201C;<foreign>braid-band</foreign> [higgledy-piggledy],&#x201D; and the struggle of a re-settlement in full progress. On the whole, we found things in a wonderful degree of order and can expect to be on our feet again in a comparatively short period. Betty,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Smeal, who had taken care of Craigenputtoch during the winter.</note> at her own request, goes home again; being too <hi rend="italic">weak in the arms</hi> for such rubbing as is wanted. She has managed very well, I think; and may be useful in the same way again. We have got another stronger woman; but she also only lasts a week; and this night, Jane is writing off to Templand for some more permanent character that her Mother was speaking of. We shall be rid of the Gardener in a day or at most two; and then if this strong-armed woman has carried us over the first tumult, things will run smoother: at all events, it is <hi rend="italic">not long till whitsunday</hi>.</p>
<p>Mean while I have got my writing-table mounted again, and am trying to do a little. I have got some <hi rend="italic">more work</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Work on the &#x201C;Death of Goethe.&#x201D; In order to write the essay on Goethe, which he finished <date when="1832-04-26">26 April</date>, Carlyle set aside the &#x201C;Corn Law Rhymes,&#x201D; finished about <date when="1832-05-04">4 May</date>.</note> since I saw you: so that I cannot promise myself still to be done in less than three weeks: <hi rend="italic">that</hi> time, however, I think <hi rend="italic">will</hi> see me thro&#x2019;,&#x2014;if I luck.</p>
<p>The grand question, when am I coming to Scotsbrig? is thus answered of itself. I shall be ready, and very willing to come at that time: and Alick and I seemed to have made some arrangement about getting some conveyance then also: so that this seems to be the present state of the matter, I think. I shall send you a little Line, by Notman, some Wednesday between us <supplied>[now]</supplied> and then, say this day fortnight, sooner if anything particular occur: so give your heart, dear Mother, no uneasiness about us.</p>
<p>I told Macdiarmid yesterday to send the <hi rend="small-caps">Courier</hi> hither in future: I mean to send <hi rend="italic">it on to Alick</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> to you (for I think you liked it best); and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> shall be as punctual as possible; only you know how we are situated here; besides I am not yet quite absolutely sure that my London C<supplied>[orres]</supplied>pondent<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom Holcroft.</note> will despatch the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, just like <supplied>[clock]</supplied>-work: so you must pardon irregularity, should such occur.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-148" n="06:148"/>Pray explain also to Alick that if any day I have but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Newspaper to send, it will be natural that I give <hi rend="italic">you</hi> the preference, even tho&#x2019; it were the Paper he usually gets.</p>
<p>I have nothing to tell Jamie about horses. Alick went with me yesterday to look after one we had heard of at Dumfries, but it and its owner were absent; so I got my journey for my pains; except only learning, as we did to a certainty, that it was &#x201C;actually for to sell.&#x201D; Alick is to return the first leisure day; probably tomorrow week, and <supplied>[try]</supplied> to buy it for me; there seems a likelihood th<supplied>[at it]</supplied> will be got cheap; at or under &#xa3;15. It shall go to Scotsbrig and harrow, if you like. I think, I am off with Farries;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either George (&#x201C;Waffler&#x201D;), the carrier; Robert, the butcher; or William Farries, the publican, all of Ecclefechan.</note> he is too dear for me: if no better may be, I can get Alick&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">black</hi>, and give up the idea of <hi rend="italic">riding</hi>, which however would be very wholesome for me.&#x2014; And now enough! The Paper is done: hardly room for my love to you all. Take care of yourself, my dear Mother, and be long well for a blessing to us all. Give us your Prayers; the Prayer of a devout, God-fearing heart is precious. God keep you all! <closer><salute>Your affectionate son,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>If it can gratify any wish of yours, I shall very readily undertake that little piece on <hi rend="italic">Byron:</hi> but it will be <foreign><hi rend="italic">tacente Minerv&#xe2;</hi></foreign>, without inward call; nor indeed am I sure that you have fixed on the right man for your object.</p>
<p>In my mind, Byron has been sinking at an accelerated rate, for the last ten years, and has now reached a very low level: I should say <hi rend="italic">too</hi> low, were there not a <hi rend="italic">Hibernicism</hi> involved in the expression. His <pb id="pg-06-149" n="06:149"/>fame has been very great, but I see not how it is to endure; neither does that make <hi rend="italic">him</hi> great. No genuine productive Thought was ever revealed by him to mankind; indeed no clear undistorted vision into anything, or picture of anything; but all had a certain falsehood, a brawling theatrical insincere character. The man&#x2019;s moral nature too was bad, his demeanour, as a man, was bad. What was he, in short, but a huge <hi rend="italic">sulky Dandy;</hi> of giant dimensions, to be sure, yet still a Dandy; who sulked, as poor Mrs Hunt expressed it<supplied>[,]</supplied> &#x201C;like a schoolboy that had got a plain bunn given him instead of a plum one.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently Carlyle had heard Mrs. Leigh Hunt say this.</note> His Bunn was nevertheless God&#x2019;s Universe with what Tasks are there; and it had served better men than he. I love him not; I <hi rend="italic">owe</hi> him nothing; only pity, and forgiveness: he taught me nothing that I had not again to forget.</p>
<p>Of course, one could not wilfully propose to astonish or shock the general feeling of the world; least of all, in a quiet Dictionary of Arts and Sciences.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a letter of <date when="1832-04-24">24 April</date> Napier had asked Carlyle to write a short article on Byron, not for the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, but for the new (seventh) edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia Britannica</hi>, of which he was the editor. In <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, pp. 267&#x2013;68, Carlyle says that he began this piece and &#x201C;jotted down some pages&#x201D; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">purely</hi> in compliance&#x201D; with Napier&#x2019;s request, but &#x201C;had much rather eschew it.&#x201D; He did not complete the article.</note> Indeed, I suppose nothing is wanted but a clear legible Narrative, with some little summing-up, and outline of a Character, such as a deliberate man may without disgrace in after times be found to have written down in the year <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>. Whether you dare venture to have his spirit traceable in it, I must now leave you to judge; adding only (if that be necessary) that you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> freely left; that I can in no wise esteem it a slight or a disadvantage, should you see good, as perhaps I might do in your case, to employ some other hand.</p>
<p>If, on the contrary, you still persist, then be so good as transmit me your copy of <hi rend="italic">Moore&#x2019;s Life of Byron</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Moore, <hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals of Lord Byron: with Notices of His Life</hi>, 2 vols. (London, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>). See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301123-TC-MN-01">TC to MN, <date when="1830-11-23">23 Nov. 1830</date></ref>.</note> (the second volume of which I have never seen), and word along with it, How many Edinburgh Review pages three or four of the Encyclopedia make. If the Parcel can be in Dumfries about Wednesday come a week, it will not have to lie; I shall be going down to Annadale about that time; will return with it hither, and hope to send back both your Book and the Article before you return to London: somewhat earlier if necessary.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Cornlaw Rhymes</hi> has given some foolish trouble: it had better stay here yet a while and go with the rest. So much for business.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-150" n="06:150"/>You will find the Literary World of London, and indeed all the worlds of it in a very wonderful condition; too like what Ephraim Jenkinson described long ago: &#x201C;the World, my Dear Sir, is in its <hi rend="italic">dotage</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>According to promise I will now scribble you a Line; but it must be very short; for I am <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> otherwise, as you will suspect, and there is still a good third of my day&#x2019;s task to do. Our Maid is to set forth (on Harry) for MacKnights so soon as tea is over: therefore I make the most of my time.</p>
<p>We are getting along quite handsomely here tho&#x2019; in the middle of chaos and confusion worse confounded: Jemmy Aitken<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Aitken, house painter of Dumfries, who married Carlyle&#x2019;s sister Jean.</note> and his man and innumerable oilpots being full operation: they are painting the dining room, lobby and staircase; and to avoid such a <foreign><hi rend="italic">slaister</hi></foreign> [mess] for the future, doing it in oil. We live in the drawing-room, meanwhile; and I for my part, study to &#x201C;<foreign>jook</foreign> and let the <foreign>jaw</foreign> go by [duck and let the wave go by],&#x201D;&#x2014;minding my own business, as much as possible, and what is not my business as little as possible.</p>
<p>Betty Smeal and Mary (of whose safe arrival we were somewhat <hi rend="italic">relieved</hi> to hear) would tell you more minutely than my little Note, how all stood with us a fortnight ago. Jane had sent off to Templand for a maid; but began to regret that she had not endeavoured to bargain with the other, who awkward as she was seemed faithful and punctual: however, on the monday a new figure made her appearance; one &#x201C;Nancy&#x201D; from Thornhill,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311100-JWC-MAC-01">JWC to MAC, <date when="1831-11-00">Nov. 1831</date></ref>.</note> a most assiduous, blithe-faced<pb id="pg-06-151" n="06:151"/>little stump of a body, who will do excellently well for a month. The Cow too is mending: Jane is far heartier, now that she has got to work; to bake; and (mark this) <hi rend="italic">to preserve eggs</hi>&#x2014;in lime-water: So that, as I said, the household stands on a quite tolerable footing.</p>
<p>For a week, I felt exceedingly out of my element; inclined to be wretched and sulky; no work would prosper with me: I had to burn as fast as I wrote. However, by degrees I got <foreign><hi rend="italic">hefted</hi></foreign> [adjusted] again; and took obediently to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">gang</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">gear</hi></foreign> [pace and the harness]. I have got one piece of Work done, and sent off to London; the other I have now fairly on the anvil, hot before me, and will soon hammer it out. One that is still in the middle, ought not as you know, to <hi rend="italic">crow day:</hi> however, I think I can calculate on being pretty well thro&#x2019; before this week end. So that Jane may tell Alick that I shall be <hi rend="italic">ready for a horse</hi> any time after Wednesday next he likes: let him either come on Wednesday, therefore, or send me word then what are his motions, and when he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> coming. I have seen or heard nothing more (since his Letter) of the Dumfries beast, and will wait now till I be there at any rate,&#x2014;if indeed we are not provided otherwise in the mean time.</p>
<p>This, I believe, dear Mother is the main purport of my Letter: that I am to see you again so soon. We will then go thro&#x2019; everything by the more convenient method.</p>
<p>I wrote to Jack, on Saturday, addressing as he had directed in your Letter. Thank Jane for the Cover she wrote me on that occasion. I sent Alick the last Courier; you the last <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, by some of the Carstammon people to Minnyive. It would be at Ecclefechan on Tuesday:&#x2014; I have rooted out a thousand <hi rend="italic">docks</hi> with my dock-spade, which I find to be an invaluable Tool.</p>
<p>Let me pray that I may find you as well as Jane described; &#x2018;mending the Backburn road.&#x2019; I add no more, but the Message of my Goodwife&#x2019;s true love to one and all of you. My own heart&#x2019;s-wishes are with you all always. I remain</p>

<salute>My dear Jane</salute>
<p>I hasten by the earliest opportunity to rectify a blunder, which has just been intimated to me&#x2014;so <hi rend="italic">palpable</hi> a one, that I almost wonder it should not have rectified itself. It seems the little broach I brought you from London with my hair in it&#x2014;was deposited in the wrong place&#x2014;one more instance of the truth of the old saying that one always does one&#x2019;s own errand best. Surely Jenny&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jenny (Janet) was the youngest sister.</note> usually <foreign>gleg</foreign> intellect must have been under a remarkable hallucination on that occasion or as my Grandfather would say without seeking further light&#x2014;&#x201C;the Girl must be in love.&#x201D; It was such an altogether unfeasable [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] thing that in distributing these little tokens of my remembra<supplied>[n]</supplied>ce I should have alone passed over the one who might naturally have expected to be remembered the very first.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As the oldest of the sisters.</note></p>
<p>I inquired when I gave Jenny hers where is Jane&#x2014;down stairs making the porridge was the answer&#x2014; I held the two remaining boxes in my hand&#x2014;&#x201C;the boxes<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> I said <supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied>are proportioned to your different sizes but the contents are all the same&#x2014;Mary is gone to bed.

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>I did not remember, till your silence called it to my mind, that when friends part it is the travelling friend who must write first, and send the other notice of his existence and geographical position. Today I have a frank to London (or I make one); and so transmit you, in black on white, authentic assurance both that I am <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and that some news from you would be very welcome.</p>
<p>My time is too short for entering into particulars. I could write <pb id="pg-06-154" n="06:154"/>long idyllic paragraphs on the whistling of the Blackbirds, the budding of the Woods; how the people are all cutting Turf for fuel on the moors, and the grouse hatching; and unhappily the East Wind still blowing, and generally a sort of <hi rend="italic">Reform Bill</hi>, of the Year, passing itself thro&#x2019; the Upper House and the Under House, subject as the other Bill is to reactions enough. Suffice it to say that we are here, safe in our Patmos; and from this verge of Creation send many a kind thought towards some that are left pent up in the very heart of its activity. Greater contrast, as we often remark, could not be, than between the life-torrent of Fleet-Street and the Whinstone mountains of Nithsdale, where Silence, on her throne of crags, over her empire of heath and bog, rules supreme. Yet the blue Dome, I often say, overspans us here too: &#x201C;this too is the World, the City of God.&#x201D; Let no man become elegaic [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], let him be epic and active. &#x201C;There where thou art, there where thou remainest, be busy, be happy; let the present time and scene suffice thee.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre</hi>, bk. VII, ch. i; Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 2, Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 196&#x2013;97.</note> What after all is the World anywhere but a Workshop; your best room in it, that where your Tools lie most convenient? Thus if we rejoice that Brick London and &#x201C;the smok<supplied>[e]</supplied> of its torment,&#x201D; is hundreds of miles away from us, must we not bear with patience the other feeling that Social London too is distant, and the scattered tones of Truth and Earnestness and kind Affection, that used to cheer us in the inane hubbub, are no longer audible? &#x201C;Be busy, be happy&#x201D;; above all, be busy!</p>
<p>My <hi rend="italic">Business</hi> since I returned hither has been of a manifold rather than of an elevated character. I have <hi rend="italic">sticked</hi> pease, set moletraps, rooted out three thousand docks; endured the horror of two Painters for three weeks; and scribbled down some pages of Mysticism. That last is my only <hi rend="italic">work</hi>; the other is all mere clearing of the arena. I have a busy summer before me; which in these strange days is a blessing one ought to recognise.</p>
<p>The Corn Law Rhymer has got his <hi rend="italic">Article</hi>; which if it be not of too &#x201C;doctrinal&#x201D; a character, you will see in the next <hi rend="italic">Edin</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>. On the latter point, however, there are grounds for doubt: I am astonished to find on reading the thing over that it is &#x201C;speculative-radical&#x201D; to an almost frightful degree; and glances, in a poisonous manner, at Whiggism itself. Heaven pity poor Editors in these days! Men sent to journey among precipices and quagmires at twelve o&#x2019;clock at night, and the most with hardly the quarter of an eye.&#x2014; Your three little <pb id="pg-06-155" n="06:155"/>Volumes<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The three booklets of Ebenezer Elliott that Carlyle ostensibly reviewed when he wrote his essay for the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>. See Mineka, XII, 107.</note> shall be faithfully sent round by Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and forwarded thro&#x2019; the Bookseller to your India House: if you want them sooner, let me know <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>, and I will take some speedier method.&#x2014; A little Paper entitled &#x201C;Death of Goethe,&#x201D; in Bulwer&#x2019;s next Magazine, is addressed to you among others; perhaps to Mrs Austin and you more than others.</p>
<p>I too saw the Wellington revolution,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The third Reform Bill had passed the House of Commons, <date when="1832-03-23">23 March</date>, and its second reading in the House of Lords by a narrow margin on <date when="1832-04-14">14 April</date>. Parliament reassembled on <date when="1832-05-07">7 May</date>. There was no chance of the bill&#x2019;s passing its third reading in the Lords without at least the threat of creation of further peers, but the King was unwilling and the Whig ministry under Lord Grey resigned. Wellington tried to form a Tory ministry, which Peel refused to join. The Commons carried a vote of confidence in Grey&#x2019;s ministry on <date when="1832-05-10">10 May</date>, petitions from the country came in, and disturbance was expected. On <date when="1832-05-15">15 May</date> the Duke advised the King to recall Grey. The third reading passed the Lords on <date when="1832-06-04">4 June</date>, and received the royal assent on <date when="1832-06-07">7 June</date>. For local discontent and Carlyle&#x2019;s opinions, see <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, pp. 271&#x2013;75, and Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> in Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, II, 281&#x2013;82.</note>&#x2014;as I came from my Mother&#x2019;s in Annandale, last monday. They had burnt their poor patriot King at Annan; a Butcher was laid in jail for beheading him. The like at Dumfries. Nay I called in upon &#x201C;the able Editor<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M&#x2019;Diarmid. Cf. <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, p. 272.</note> of the Dumfries and Galloway Courier&#x201D; to see how it went with him; and found a man fuming and frothing, quite wonderful, like dog distract or monkey sick:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi>, I, i, 210.</note> &#x201C;base, scandalous, infernal court-intrigue,&#x201D; King Arthur,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >M&#x2019;Diarmid&#x2019;s nickname for Wellington.</note> and what not. The able Editor&#x2019;s hair was all dishevelled, froth on his lips, a snuff-drop at his nose. Three times, in the void chill night, did I, otherwise melancholy enough, laugh aloud, while driving hither, at thought of that able Editor. Petitions, Addresses, Postp<supplied>[one]</supplied>ment of Birthday Dinners, and other terrific things were going on. A poor man <supplied>[told]</supplied> me that 130,000 men had marched from Birmingham to London; another had heard some rumour that &#x201C;the Highlandmen were coming down.&#x201D; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tout est perdu</hi></foreign> [All is lost]!</p>
<p>For my own share it seems to me that little is lost; that we know not whether something may not be gained. Here is a Dugald Dalgetty that <hi rend="italic">professes</hi> to have no principle, except that of fighting as he is <hi rend="italic">bid</hi>, as he engages himself; but who can fight, and will fight, knave tho&#x2019; he be: we have discharged a Captain Bobadil,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wellington is also Dalgetty (a soldier of fortune in Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Legend of Montrose</hi>); and Bobadil (a vain, cowardly old soldier in <hi rend="italic">Every Man in His Humour</hi>) is Grey.</note> a soldier &#x201C;of principle,&#x201D; <pb id="pg-06-156" n="06:156"/>but who unhappily did not know what his principle was, wished much to fight for <hi rend="italic">both</hi> sides, and so stood flourishing his weapon, for eighteen months, in sight of the whole expectant Universe, and drew no drop of blood. Peace be to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> at all events! If we are to die, let it be by gunshot and cannonshot rather than by inanition and starvation. But on the whole, let Fonblanque or Bentham or some of these Chief Priests teach the people how to resist the Excise and assessed Taxes, and all and sundry will be most particularly happy to resist them.&#x2014; The world, as I often declare, is actually gone distracted&#x2014;with hard usage and insufficient diet. God help it, for I cannot.</p>
<p>Now you must undertake to write a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> Letter almost without loss of time. I want to know about all London; about no man or thing in it more than about yourself. Believe this, and on your side lay it to heart. My Wife sends you her kind remembrances,&#x2014;certified by me to be <hi rend="italic">genuine</hi>. Write therefore. Affectionate regards to Mrs Austin, to Buller (who must write), to Fonblanque and your friend Wilson<supplied>[.]</supplied><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Wilson.</note> We rejoice to see &#x201C;A.B.&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill sometimes signed his <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> articles &#x201C;A.B.,&#x201D; for example the series influenced by St.-Simonianism in <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>, which brought him and Carlyle together. Carlyle is definitely referring to Mill here.</note> in the Examiner, and could almost think we <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> him.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I was very thankful to hear of your continued welfare at Naples, by the Letter of the <date when="1832-04-30">30<hi rend="italic">th</hi> April</date>, which our Neighbours here brought us up from Dunscore on Sunday Evening. I take Tuesday, the very next opportunity of answering it.&#x2014; There is, as usual, a huge mass of Postage concerns to rectify in the first place; for our Correspondence, unhappily flies out not with one thread meeting another thread, but with a whole ravelled fringe of threads meeting (or missing) another <pb id="pg-06-157" n="06:157"/>ravelled fringe. Let us be thankful, as you say, that there is <hi rend="italic">any</hi> post. As to your Letters they seem all to have come: one to me at London, which followed me hither, four or five weeks ago; then our Mother&#x2019;s; then this last. So far well: but with my Letters to you again, it is quite <hi rend="italic">un</hi>well; and I must again write you a long empty waybill, with the sad doubt whether one item of it may yet have come to hand. First, a copy of the Review Article <hi rend="italic">Characteristics</hi>, sent off in <date when="1832-02-00">February</date> by one Stratford Wallis<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> an English Painter, to be left with Mr Burrell<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Burrell. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref></note> or Lady Clare at Florence, about the beginning of <date when="1832-04-00">April</date>; there was no Note or word with it, only the address written on the fly-leaf: so, if it be wholly lost, the difference will be trifling. Secondly a Letter perhaps about the <date when="1832-03-12">12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of March</date>, directed in the same way to Florence; and forwarded by Will<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Fraser thro&#x2019; the Foreign Office: he told me he had sent it off. Thirdly a Copy of the Fraser&#x2019;s-Magazine Article <hi rend="italic">Croker&#x2019;s Johnson</hi>, inclosed by me, with a short Note, under a Cover also directed to the Care of Mr Burrell, and consigned to Fraser who assured me he <hi rend="italic">would</hi> send it off instantly by the Foreign Office: it made a weighty-looking Letter, but the private part of it was trifling, written in great haste, perhaps on the <date when="1832-03-24">24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of March</date> the day before we left London: if it too be lost, the loss will be insignificant. Fourthly, a Letter despatched from this place, some three weeks ago; likewise under cover to Fraser, who was to inform me if he did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> send it off,&#x2014;as was also stipulated with regard to the <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> Packet; in neither of which cases has he written. Fifthly and lastly <hi rend="italic">this</hi> even now begun Letter, which I determine on sending by the Post, <foreign><hi rend="italic">auf gut Gluck</hi></foreign> [taking a chance]; as it seems to carry <hi rend="italic">from</hi> you, quite regularly in a period of some twenty days, why should it not carry <hi rend="italic">to</hi> you, in three days more? Allow three days for their cholera fumigations: poor devils, if they had all as little need of fumigating!&#x2014; But on the whole is it not sad that I must occupy a third part of your whole Letter with writing about writing! And doing so the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> time; for all this was punctually written down in my last Letter too! But we will be patient, and hope. Meanwhile blame not your Roman vicegarent: I sent nothing to Rome; nothing anywhither, but what is here mentioned. Also the cream of all the news I sent was simply &#x201C;nothing singular; much about our usual way, thank you.&#x201D; Happily this is still the essence of what I write: could I but <hi rend="italic">shoot</hi> it thro&#x2019; space, and reassure your heart from its anxieties!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-158" n="06:158"/>We are well pleased with your sketches of Naples, with its noisy, empty inmates, its <foreign>Lazzaroni</foreign> [beggars] by profession, or only by practice without profession: there is much to be seen, thought of, and remembered in such a scene. Something it is to stand with your own actual feet on a spot distinguished in some particular beyond all others on our Planet. We are also contented with the appearance of your domestic position; and would fain see farther into it, and form a more coherent complete picture of it. Your noble Patient seems to suffer more than we anticipated; a certain real pity for her forlorn fortune, so gorgeous outwardly, within so desolate, comes over me: one would fancy it no despicable task to struggle towards rectifying a Life wherein are such capabilities of good. But, alas, how little can be done! Therein, as in so many other cases, must the Patient minister unto herself.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, V, iii.</note> He whom Experience has not taught innumerable <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> lessons will be wretched at the bottom of Fortune&#x2019;s Cornucopia; and some are so dull at taking up! On the whole, the higher classes of modern Europe, especially of actual England, are here objects of compassion. Be thou compassionate, patiently faithful: leave no means untried, <hi rend="italic">work</hi> for thy wages; and it will be well with thee.&#x2014; Those <foreign><hi rend="italic">Herzensergiessungen eines Einsamen</hi></foreign> [Effusions of a lonely person] which the late Letters abound in, are not singular to me; the spirit that dwells in them is such as I can heartily approve of. It is an earnest mind seeking some place of rest for itself, struggling to get its foot off the quicksand, and fixed on the rock. The only thing I regret or fear is that there should <hi rend="italic">be</hi> so much occupation of the mind upon itself. Turn <hi rend="italic">outward;</hi> attempt not (the impossibility) to &#x201C;Know thyself,&#x201D; but solely to &#x201C;Know what thou canst work at.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle rejects the dictum of Socrates inscribed over the portico of the temple at Delphi. See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 163.</note> This last is a possible knowledge for every creature, and the only profitable one: neither is there any way of attaining it, except <hi rend="italic">trial</hi>, the attempt <hi rend="italic">to work</hi>. Attempt honestly, the result even if unsuccessful will be infinitely instructive. I can see too, my dear Brother, that you have a great want in your present otherwise so prosperous condition: you have not anything like enough <hi rend="italic">to do</hi>. I daresay many a poor riding Apothecary with five times your labour and the fifth part of your income is happier.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written on <date when="1832-04-30">30 April</date>: &#x201C;The only real engagement I have during the day is to see Lady Clare about noon, &#x26; then after business we often read some German together. The rest of the day is free except when I succeed in persuading Miss Morris [Lady Clare&#x2019;s traveling companion] to walk out, &#x26; even then I am only occupied a short while.&#x201D;</note> Nevertheless stand to it tightly; <hi rend="italic">every</hi> time brings <pb id="pg-06-159" n="06:159"/>its duty. If your Lady require your services another year, you will have as much money as will set you up handsomely wherever you like to try, and then all things lie before you: meanwhile are you not enjoying the inexpressible deliverance of paying off your debts, and inwardly resolving that no earthly influence will ever again lead you into such bondage?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the same letter John had written: &#x201C;Lady Clare will order her banker to pay &#xa3;100 to your account in the Commercial Bank Dumfries. She will write sometime within the next week or ten days, perhaps tomorrow. You will have the trouble of paying Alick what I owe him, &#x26; &#xa3;25 of the remainder to the L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Advocate [Jeffrey]. There is a sort of <foreign>burble</foreign> [confusion] in regard to the remainder of Hazlitts sum, which he desired me to lay out for charitable purposes. It is this: Jeffrey gave me &#xa3;50 (after Hazlitts death) by his direction I sent 10 Guin<hi rend="italic">s</hi> to Literary Fund, 10 G<hi rend="italic">s</hi> to a Mr Henning in Pimlico, and 10 towards Hazlitts funeral &#x26; to Procter so that there remained in my hand 18 &#xa3;-10S. &#xa3;5 were given out in the way he directed but repaid to me. My whole debt were therefore 43&#xa3; 10S. Do as you think best in regard to it. If there be enough left it may be better to repay the whole &#x26; be done with it at once. It were also of no consequence if it should be over another half year in case you find the money useful at present. It can make no difference to Jeffrey seeing I am sure of being able to pay him. Do as you think best.&#x201D;</note> It is in this way, if in no other, that &#x201C;your present state connects itself with your future,&#x201D; a most favourable and essential connexion. For the rest, as I have said some hundreds of times, it seems to me the most insignificant consideration of all, whether you set yourself down to exercise that noble faculty of Healing, in London or elsewhere, among the higher ranks: or among the lower: among God&#x2019;s immortal creatures, groaning under the fardles of a weary life; it will not fail to be; and if <hi rend="italic">honest</hi>, your Doctorship must in any and all situations be a <hi rend="italic">martyrdom;</hi> not a working for wages, which latter exist only for the bond Drudge, not for the free Doer. Think of all this, as you are wont; but think of it rather with a <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> intent: all speculation is beginningless and endless. Do not let yourself into <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gr&#xfc;beln</hi></foreign> [brooding], even in your present state of partial inaction. I well, infinitely too well, know what <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gr&#xfc;blen</hi></foreign> is: a wretched sink of Darkness, Pain, a paralytic Fascination; cover it up; that is to say, <hi rend="italic">neglect</hi> it for some outward piece of Action: go resolutely forward, you will not heed the precipices that gape on the right hand of you, and on the left. In Naples, for example, is there not much that you can <hi rend="italic">do?</hi> I speak not of sight-seeing: doubtless you have been or will be at Virgil&#x2019;s Tomb, their Dog-Grotto, Vesuvius, Herculaneum, and what not; and have your eyes open, and your <hi rend="italic">pen</hi> going: but there is much more than all this to be seen. There are <hi rend="italic">men</hi> at Naples, and <pb id="pg-06-160" n="06:160"/>their way of Life, their <hi rend="italic">practice</hi> in all things, <hi rend="italic">medical</hi>, moral, legislative, artistic, economic.

And so God keep you, and me; and make us all helpful and honourable to one another, and &#x201C;not ashamed to live&#x201D; (as a voice<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >That of their father.</note> we have often heard was wont to pray), &#x201C;nor afraid to die.&#x201D; Amen.</p>
<p>I sent you all the Scotsbrig news in my last letter. I have been there since; only last week, and found them all struggling along, much as of old. Our dear Mother holds out well; is in fair health; not more dispirited than almost any one would be under her bereavement; and <pb id="pg-06-161" n="06:161"/>peaceful, with a high trust in the great Guide of all. We expect her here in about a week, with Alick, who is bringing me up the Cart, with some sort of Horse he was to buy for me. I was over at his Farm too (which is <hi rend="italic">named</hi> Catlinns); a mile from the junction of Corrie and Milk, towards Lockerbie: it is a large mass of <hi rend="italic">rough</hi> farm, with some considerable space of good land in it; somewhat <hi rend="italic">bare</hi>, and the houses &#x26;c in bad order: but is thought to be <hi rend="italic">cheap</hi>, by judges. He is toiling at it very hard, looks lean, but otherwise hearty; diligent and prudent. Jenny has given him a queer lively little girl,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Little Jane Welsh Carlyle the second.</note> which he is very fond of.&#x2014; We settled everything at Scotsbrig; the Departed had left it all ready for settlement. Your name or mine (as I had myself requested) is not mentioned in his Will: it was all between my Mother and the other Five. Each had to claim some perhaps &#xa3;120 (each of the <hi rend="italic">five;</hi> our Mother has the Houses with some &#xa3;28 yearly, during life);<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Houses in Ecclefechan yielding this sum in rent.

I think they will be able to go on as heretofore: they are not unreasonable; only young; and our Mother is with them. Your letter had given them all great pleasure; their affection is true as steel.</p>
<p>Of ourselves here there is not much new to be said.

<ps><p>Of the extraneous friends I had written largely in the last Letter; have heard nothing since.

Caledonian Chapel (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1832-05-05">5 May</date>). He therefore resumed open-air preaching, as at Islington Green, where he addressed an assembly of about one thousand and where two of his followers had been arrested for doing exactly the same thing. In their case, the magistrate had commented, &#x201C;We do not want any preaching here. &#x2026; I am exceedingly sorry that respectable individuals such as you are should go about collecting together multitudes of working people and idle persons in this manner&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1832-04-13">13 April</date>).

<p>In the first place I have to say that I wish you well, and my affection for you continues unabated! in the second that our potatoes are <pb id="pg-06-164" n="06:164"/>near done and my valuable Husband (for whom I can never be sufficiently thankful) informs me you have some to dispose of. That being the case it occurs to an ordinary mind that a stock adequate to supply the wants of my Husband, domestics, hens, and self might be conveniently brought up in Alicks cart on Wednesday. Also eight stones of oatmeal will be highly acceptable being reputed very superior.

Carlyle is of opinion you could further furnish me with a stone of pot barley&#x2014;in case I should take a notion at rare intervals of boiling the pot for my Boy. Have you any Barley flour that would diet him at a cheaper rate than oatbread&#x2014;cheapness you know is the grand object to be aimed at in his <hi rend="italic">keep</hi>&#x2014;if so a few stones might perhaps be forthcoming by the same opportunity&#x2014;</p>
<p>Moreover I charge you as you value a sisters blessing to instruct Alick or your Mother or both (to make assurance doubly sure) to bring me up with them <hi rend="italic">from M</hi>rs <hi rend="italic">Montgomery</hi> in Dumfries&#x2014;a stone of her best fine flour and another stone of what she calls second flour.&#x2014;secondly a stone of coarse Beef to salt for the said Boy.</p>
<p>Thirdly a hindquarter of blackfaced mutton for ourselves&#x2014;and some flounders if there are such a thing in the market&#x2014;and fourthly and for the comfort of all lastly two pence worth of Ye<supplied>[a]</supplied>st from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Dick.</p>
<p>O no I have still another commission expressly for your Mother&#x2014; To provide me if money or money&#x2019;s worth can accomplish it with one <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> laying duck. The duck department here is fallen into a condition lamentable to contemplate&#x2014; The females two in number are both maimed for life, and the drake naturally brokenhearted&#x2014;an egg were little short of a miracle with them now&#x2014;and to feed them &#x201C;for naething&#x201D; is out of the question in these hard times for literary and all sorts of men.

<p><salute>My Dear Jamie,&#x2014;</salute> I have still to add that you must charge Alick to buy me three things as he passes thro&#x2019; Dumfries: a secondhand bridle and secondhand crupper (for the Boy&#x2019;s saddle) the coarser and stronger the better; thirdly a new good Crupper for my own saddle, which is and was always without one. This <hi rend="italic">third</hi> article, indeed, will be chiefly wanted on the supposition that you and he have purchased me a <hi rend="italic">Horse;</hi> for as you well know, a crupper without horse is worth little for riding on. However I hope you have got me some sort of quadruped: the Water-of-Milk galloper, or Farries&#x2019;s runner,&#x2014;or some one.</p>
<p>I sent my Mother a London Newspaper last Wednesday; then the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> by a chance we had to Minnyive on Friday: along with the last went a Dumfries Courier for Alick, marked &#x201C;with care&#x201D; (Catlinns, Lockerby). I hope, they all came to hand.&#x2014;&#x2014; I have had a Letter from Jack; a long one: all is well; the Doctor full of speculation: I may as well inclose it; only my Mother must bring it back for I have scarcely got it rightly seen into yet. I wrote to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> this forenoon. Keep my Mother to her promise; she must get Alick off in time.&#x2014; God be with you all, and keep you always! <closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>While in London, I furnished myself with this poor Copy of my poor &#x201C;first Book,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> (<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>).</note> with intent to put you in mind of me by means of <pb id="pg-06-166" n="06:166"/>it: which intent will you now give me leave to realise? If that lean fruit of Sickness and Sorrow do in addition yield you, or your worthy Mother, an hour of endurable reading, it will be so much over and above.</p>
<p>We miss you both here very much; and are like to do: it often seems to us as if the want of such a neighbourhood were the main shadow in our sunshine. <hi rend="italic">A</hi> shadow there will always be so long as there is a Sun: this ought to quiet us, to satisfy us. We can hope also to hear good news of you from Moffat, as we have already heard: from persons whom God has favoured with clearness of head and bravery of heart no <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> news, properly speaking, <hi rend="italic">can</hi> come; but all either is good, or will turn to good. Perhaps too you will not always be personally such a stranger: surely when you look into Nithsdale, Craigenputtoch will not be altogether forgotten.</p>
<p>My Wife is about writing, and will tell you all our news: how we sat begrimed and benoised, all winter, in that monstrous &#x201C;Cesspool of the Universe&#x201D;; and are now escaped into the free air and the natural health; not displeased that we went, or that we returned; and view (every Wednesday Night) the Revolutions and Parliamentary Debates of this mad world wi<supplied>[th]</supplied> a composure which only Dwellers in the Desart can experience.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane&#x2019;s detailed letter, if written, has not been found.</note></p>
<p>We have long had some excursion to Moffat in our eye: but things will not answer; the new day brings its new difficulty, which is to be its new duty: this summer too I see work enough before me. However, we will still hope, still keep scheming.</p>
<p>I beg particularly to express my respect, &#x26; affectionate wishes for your worthy Mother: may all that is good and of good report still lie in her lot! You also are not, in any case, to forget us; you are to write soon, and come and see us. <closer><salute>Believe me always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I now forward this story of the <hi rend="italic">Corn Law Rhymes</hi>, which has been lying ready for a good while: it will meet you, as you directed, <pb id="pg-06-167" n="06:167"/>at your return, about the <date when="1832-06-01">first of June</date>. The little Parcel for London contains the <hi rend="italic">Corn Law Rhymes</hi> themselves,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle puts an asterisk here and adds in the margin: &#x201C;Alas! There is another considerable (romance) stock added by my Wife.&#x201D; As late as <date when="1832-09-17">17 Sept.</date> Mill wrote to Carlyle that he had not yet received his books (Mineka, XII, 121).</note> which I borrowed from John Mill for this end; and now desire you to be so kind as transmit to him, thro&#x2019; the Messrs Longman, by the first convenience you have.&#x2014; Here too, let me request another favour of you about Books: To retain from the first money you have to pay me as much as will replace your copy of <hi rend="italic">Taylor&#x2019;s Historic Survey</hi>, which I never returned, and ought long ago to have given account of, and made apology and all possible amends for. The case was this: I was called, somewhat on the sudden, to send off a Book Packet to Weimar, wherein the English Translation of <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie</hi> was to form an item. No <hi rend="italic">Taylor&#x2019;s Iphigenia</hi> could be had in the London Shops; nor elsewhere within my capabilities on so short notice: whereupon, yielding to lawless Necessity, I tied a silk-thread round that portion of your Book which contained the piece in requisition; and despatched the whole Three Volumes to my venerated Correspondent; by whom doubtless they were welcomed as quite honestly come by.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310122-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1831-01-22">22 Jan. 1831</date></ref>.</note> What can I do now but repair my offense; and both for it, and for my long neglect to acknowledge and repair it, suffer according to your good pleasure?</p>
<p>Any Proof-sheets, Books &#x26;c will reach me here most conveniently, if inclosed under cover to &#x201C;Messrs M&#x2019;Kinnel &#x26; M&#x2019;Kie, Booksellers, Dumfries,&#x201D; and left for them at Oliver &#x26; Boyd&#x2019;s, Tweeddale Court; by whom a Parcel is despatched every Tuesday afternoon: what in it belongs to me, being duly cared for, gets hither within four and twenty hours. This arrangement I made three weeks ago; and hope to find very profitable. The Mail-Coach people are also safe enough: but whether our Moorland Carrier and they, on their weekly opportunity, will take the trouble of communicating remains always more or less uncertain.</p>
<p>I know not whether there is anything in the Signet Library, or otherwise within your reach, about Count Cagliostro: I have long had a curiosity about that &#x201C;King of Quacks,&#x201D; and coul<supplied>[d]</supplied> get little satisfaction. The <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;mories de Casanova</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Balsamo (<date when="1743-00-00">1743</date>&#x2013;<date when="1795-00-00">95</date>) was known as Count Cagliostro. Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;Count Cagliostro: in Two Flights&#x201D; was to appear in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, VIII (<date when="1833-07-00">July</date>, <date when="1833-08-00">Aug. 1833</date>), 19&#x2013;28 and 132&#x2013;55; reprinted in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 249&#x2013;318. Giovanni Jacopo Casanova (<date when="1725-00-00">1725</date>&#x2013;<date when="1798-00-00">98</date>) was an Italian adventurer. Carlyle says in the essay on Cagliostro that he would not have &#x201C;grudged to dive even into the infectious <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;mories</hi> &#x2026; for a hint or two,&#x2014;could he have found that work, which, however, most British Librarians make a point of denying they possess&#x201D; (p. 258). In a Journal entry for ca. <date when="1832-05-18">18</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-05-21">21 May</date> Carlyle wrote: &#x201C;Cagliostro: there seems to be no special history of him: some notices in the <hi rend="italic">Zeitgenossen</hi> (xi Frau von Recke); in the <hi rend="italic">Memoires</hi> of Casanova; which latter &#x2018;Proteus&#x2019; himself were well worth knowing.&#x2014; Inquire at Edinburgh?&#x201D;</note> is another Book I should like to <pb id="pg-06-168" n="06:168"/>see. And generally if anything notable rise on your horizon, I shall request you to give me notice; my horizon here, on some sides, is limited enough.</p>
<p>When I shall see you cannot yet be fixed. In winter, at latest, I expect to spend some time in Edinburgh; and will then use all diligence. I am to be busy enough thro&#x2019; these Summer Months; or I might run in, for a day or two, in the interim. I hope, at all events, to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> you something of a more unquestionable character, ere long.</p>
<p>There is still another thing I have to trouble you with: an Application on behalf of the Mr Gordon<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Gordon. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270329-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:201</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-03-29">29 March 1827</date></corr></ref>, but an error in the note there must be corrected here. Gordon did help edit the <hi rend="italic">New Statistical Account of Scotland</hi> (<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), but Sir John Sinclair did not.</note> for whom that Penny-post Letter is directed. He is diligently canvassing for the office of University Secretary, vacant by the death of Dr Duncan; and seems to hope, that should the Senatus Academicus decide for a Non-Professor, he may have a favourable chance. Twelve promised votes he already enumerates; and now would fain make an attempt on yours; with which view he writes me a most earnest Letter, that I might break the ground for him. I cannot deny the worthy help-needing man; and know, you will excuse me, and let my word do no harm, should it seem beyond my commission to meddle in such things. Gordon used to come much about me while I lived in Edinburgh: I reckon him a highly amiable, modest, meritorious character; of superior talent and attainment; nothing in him that I ever discerned but courteous, cheerful integrity, patient diligence, withal a certain lovingness and hope, that makes him a friend, and finds him friends: a man of clearness, and method, with the utmost simplicity of heart. He has long acted under Principal Baird<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Husband Baird (<date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), principal of the University of Edinburgh (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>). It was said of him that within twelve months of his marriage to a daughter of the Lord Provost he was made a doctor of divinity, pastor of New Greyfriars, professor of Hebrew, and principal, and that his second name represented his chief claim to office.</note> and some General-Assembly&#x2019;s Education Committee, in a somewhat similar capacity;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baird was convener and Gordon was secretary of the Church of Scotland General Assembly&#x2019;s sub-committee for increasing the means for Education and Religious Instruction in Scotland, particularly in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. On <date when="1832-05-28">28 May 1832</date> Thomas Chalmers, as Moderator, thanked the committee for its &#x201C;unwearied and affectionate exertion in this most pious and charitable undertaking.&#x201D;</note> managing everything, <pb id="pg-06-169" n="06:169"/>as I believe he has documents to testify, in a really <hi rend="italic">excellent</hi> way. Could he, in addition, secure this College Secretaryship, his blessedness were great; his little Life-Ship completely freighted, and felicities enough before him. From all that I can judge, he might seem, both in talent and position, rather peculiarly fitted for it. I persuade myself, you will not take it ill that I bring the wants and claims of the worthy Gordon before you: to <supplied>[weigh]</supplied> them in the balance, not, unless they are the weightiest, to prefer them; this [word obliterated] must be the prayer of my petition. Perhaps, if you have not already decided <supplied>[the]</supplied> matter (in which case a single line to Gordon were the shortest method) you w<supplied>[ill]</supplied> allow him to wait upon you, and state his own case.&#x2014;&#x2014; I had almost forgot his emphatically stated declaration, which I believe to be sincere whether important or not, that he is of <hi rend="italic">no</hi> political opinion,&#x2014;except perhaps of this: &#x2018;I am born to write bad prose, and you, my worthy friends, to mend bellows, whether the stocks rise or fall.&#x2019;</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I write you before my promise, having a little message to send Alick: namely, that John&#x2019;s Money for him was lying at the Bank and is here. Poor Jack! It was very cheering (far beyond the <hi rend="italic">value</hi>) to see &#x201C;the colour of his money,&#x201D; after such weltering as he has had. There was, of course, no news there from <hi rend="italic">him;</hi> only from his Lady&#x2019;s Banker. We shall hope to hear some time this month, and you shall hear directly after.&#x2014; We had a fiddling sort of Letter from the Advocate: I one from the Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine people, who find my Paper on <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> reckoned by some (unhappily very simple persons) to be &#x201C;singularly excellent.&#x201D; So be it.&#x2014; I have not put pen to paper on <hi rend="italic">Goethe;</hi> but will this day.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-170" n="06:170"/>You would have a sorrowful time of it yesterday, with the rain which did me no ill. I got none but spits till I was in Dumfries; set off again at four o&#x2019;clock in the very middle of it, with umbrella hoisted; and arrived home not at all wetted thro&#x2019; the great coat, or anywise harmed. The &#x201C;riding mare&#x201D; is about the gentlest Beast I ever dealt with; needs no driving at all; very able, very willing; &#x201C;as handy as a fiddle.&#x201D; She will be a great benefit here; and you need not give yourself the smallest apprehension about her. She is to be shod tonight, and we will have a ride soon.&#x2014; Jane had been <hi rend="italic">off sleep</hi> again in my absence, but got <hi rend="italic">on</hi> again when I returned; and is as well as when you saw her now. She was very glad of the <hi rend="italic">steep-leather</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Calf&#x2019;s stomach salted and used for making rennet, which is used for cheese-making.</note> and <hi rend="italic"><foreign>etceteras</foreign>;</hi> is out riding, or she would send you her love in words, as in thought and feeling it is always yours.&#x2014; The Newspaper is not sent till today; directed to Jane. Tell her to write me a line how <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are. I hope and pray you may be better: O my dear Mother, could good wishes avail, how soon were you well! The knowledge and assurance that they exist is worth something. Consider us all, and at all times, as your roof and shelter, that thro&#x2019; God&#x2019;s grace will (as we <hi rend="italic">well</hi> ought) stand between you and whatever sorrow we can turn away from you. Be still our head and centre: we are not separated, while we have you.&#x2014; I am a little dullish to take my smoke <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> today; but hard work keeps everything right: besides, you will be back ere long. I will take you up, and take you down&#x2014;per <hi rend="small-caps">Clatch</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The gig.</note></p>
<p>I never saw Jenny Austin<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the sister or other relative of Carlyle&#x2019;s brother-in-law James Austin.</note> till exactly the point where she was turning off thro&#x2019; the field at home. She was barefoot, high-kilted, declared she was not wetted or injured.&#x2014; And now, dear Mother, I am away for this one. <closer><salute>God ever keep you all!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Eliza&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I could wager you now think the Scotch a less amiable Nation than you had supposed, least of all to be commended on the score <pb id="pg-06-171" n="06:171"/>of good faith. Is it not so? Has not my whole Nation suffered in your opinion thro&#x2019; my solitary fault? In <date when="1832-02-00">February</date> I made a voluntary engagement to write to you, which now in <date when="1832-06-00">June</date> remains to be fulfilled! Still I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> fulfilling it, which proves it is not altogether &#x201C;out of sight, out of mind&#x201D; with me; and could I give you an idea of the tumult I have been in, since we parted, you would find me excusable if not blameless. I never forgot my gentle Ariel in Ampton St.,&#x2014;it were positive sin to forget her, so helpful she was, so beautiful, so kind and good! Besides this is the place of all others for thinking of absent friends, where one has so seldom any present to think of. It is the stillest, solitariest place that it ever entered upon your imagination to conceive; where one has the strangest shadowy existence, nothing actual in it but the food we eat, the bed one sleeps on, and (praised be Heaven!) the fine air one breathes; the rest is all a dream of the absent and distant, of things past and to come.</p>
<p>I was fatigued enough by the journey home; still more by the <hi rend="italic">trysting</hi> that awaited me here; a dismantled house, no effectual servants, weak health, and, worse than the seven plagues of Egypt, a necessity of Painters. All these things were against me. But happily there is a continual tide in human affairs; and if a little while ago I was near being swept away, in the hubbub, so now I find myself in a dead calm. All is again in order about us, and I fold my hands and ask, &#x201C;What is to be done next?&#x201D; &#x201C;The duty nearest hand, and the next will shew itself in course.&#x201D; So my Goethe teaches.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300823-TC-HI-01">TC to HI, <date when="1830-08-23">23 Aug. 1830</date></ref>.</note> No one who lays this precept to heart can ever be at a stand. Impress it on your &#x201C;twenty children&#x201D; (that I think was the number you had fixed upon), impress it on the whole twenty from the cradle upwards, and you will spare your sons the vexation of many a wild-goose chase, and render your daughters forever impracticable to <foreign><hi rend="italic">ennui</hi></foreign>. Shame that such a malady should exist in a Christian land; should not only exist, but be almost general throughout the whole female population that is placed above the necessity of working for daily bread. If I have an antipathy for any class of people, it is for <hi rend="italic">fine ladies</hi>. I almost match my Husband&#x2019;s detestation of partridge-shooting <hi rend="italic">gentlemen</hi>. Woe to the fine lady who should find herself set down at Craigenputtock for the first time in her life, left alone with her own thoughts, no &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">fancy bazaar</hi>&#x201D; in the same kingdom with her, no place of amusement within a day&#x2019;s journey; the very church, her last imaginable resource, seven miles off. I can fancy with what horror she would look on the ridge of <pb id="pg-06-172" n="06:172"/>mountains that seemed to enclose her from all earthly bliss! with what despair in her accents she would enquire if there was not even a &#x201C;charity sale&#x201D; within reach. Alas, no! no outlet whatever for &#x201C;ladies&#x2019; work,&#x201D; not even a Book for a fine lady&#x2019;s understanding! It is plain she would have nothing for it but to die as speedily as possible, and to relieve the world of the expenses of her maintenance. For my part I am very content. I have everything here my heart desires, that I could have anywhere else, except society, and even that deprivation is not to be considered wholly an evil: if people we like and take pleasure in do not come about us here as in London, it is thankfully to be remembered that here &#x201C;the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 3:17.</note> If the knocker make no sound for weeks together, it is so much the better for my nerves. My Husband is as good company as reasonable mortal could desire. Every fair morning we ride on horse-back for an hour before breakfast (my precious horse knew me again and neighed loud and long when he found himself in his old place). Then we eat such a surprising breakfast of home-baked bread, and eggs, etc., etc., as might incite anyone that had breakfasted so long in London to write a pastoral. Then Carlyle takes to his writing, while I, like Eve, &#x201C;studious of household good,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, IX, 233.</note> inspect my house, my garden, my live stock, gather flowers for my drawingroom, and lapfuls of eggs; and finally betake myself also to writing, or reading, or making or mending, or whatever work seems fittest. After dinner, and only then, I lie on the sofa and (to my shame be it spoken) sometimes <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, but oftenest dream waking. In the evening I walk on the moor (how different from Holborn and the Strand!) and read anything that does not exact much attention. Such is my life,&#x2014;agreeable as yet from its novelty, if for nothing else. Now, would you not like to share it? I am sure you would be happy beside us for a while, and healthy; for I would keep all drugs from your lips, and pour warm milk into you. Could you not find an escort, and come and try? At all rates, write and tell me how you are, what doing and what intending. I shall always be interested in all that concerns you.</p>
<p>My health is slowly mending.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Eliza Miles&#x201D; and &#x201C;the Mileses&#x201D; are the good people in Ampton Street with whom we lodged; Eliza their daughter felt quite captivated <pb id="pg-06-173" n="06:173"/>with my Jane, and seems to have vowed eternal loyalty to her almost at first sight; was for coming to be our servant at Craig<hi rend="italic">h</hi> (actually wrote proposing it then&#x2014;a most tempting offer to us, had not the rough element and the delicate aspirant been evid<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> too irreconcileable!).

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Late at night, in the middle of a sleeping household, and of silent moors, I write you this poorest of Notes, to thank you heartily for your Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1832-05-29">29 May</date>. Pbd: Mineka, XII, 102&#x2013;7. In his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> on <date when="1832-06-06">6 June</date> or soon afterwards Carlyle wrote: &#x201C;Very kind letter from Mill, whose zealous and quite credible approbation &#x2026; of <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> gratifies me,&#x2014;I doubt, far more than it should. &#x2018;Unspeakable is the importance of man to man!&#x2019;&#x2014; A tailor at Thornhill, who had vehemently laid to heart the <hi rend="italic">Characteristics</hi>, was also a glad phenomenon to me. Let a million voices cry out, How clever! it is still nothing; let one voice cry out, How true! it lends us quite a new force and encouragement.&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, II, 282&#x2013;83.)</note> and if possible induce you to write very soon again. You <pb id="pg-06-174" n="06:174"/>must not balance debit and credit too strictly with me, in that matter; at least not now, while I am in one of my <hi rend="italic">chaotic</hi> states, and have lost all faculty of doing anything. Several days ago, I set about seriously commencing another Essay on <hi rend="italic">Goethe</hi>, which in evil hour I had undertaken for the Foreign Quarterly Editor; and now is the sad season of dubitation and dislocation when the woodenheaded must sit biting his pen, and see nothing before him but the nakedness of the land. However, I have grown in some measure used to these desperate conjunctures, and know that in one way or another light must and will be struck out; and the waste imbroglio of trivialities weave itself into a web, were it only of three-hal<supplied>[f]</supplied>penny calico. It is one of my superstitions never to turn back when you have begun: otherwise this time I should be tempted. Alas, I feel as if both here and almost everywhere else, I were all in the wrong; still weltering among barren metaphysical coils; running painfully along many a radius, but never yet reaching the true centre of it all. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Vita brevis, ars longa!</hi></foreign> [Life is short, art long!]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240902-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:146</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1824-09-02">2 Sept. 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> Nevertheless, let us, as was said, <hi rend="italic">march on</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">complain</hi> no more about it.</p>
<p>Your approval of that Paper on <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>, credible as it was to me on <hi rend="italic">your</hi> word, gratified me more than a Stoic philosopher should be willing to confess. Very precious to me is such testimony. Tho&#x2019; a thousand voices cry out, &#x2018;It is clever, let us praise it&#x2019;; this is still nothing or very little; only a shade more than if they cried, &#x2018;It is stupid, let us blame it.&#x2019; But if one sincere voice say deliberately, &#x2018;It is true, let me do it&#x2019;; this is much; it is the highest encouragement that man can give to man. So I will fancy you one of my Scholars and Teachers, and rejoice in this relation, and hope from it.</p>
<p>Your news too amused me and interested me. The poor Saint-Simonians!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written: &#x201C;Enfantin and about fifty more, among whom are our two friends d&#x2019;Eichthal and Duveyrier, have now retired to a place called M&#xE9;nilmontant at a short distance out of Paris, where they are all living together, and are employed, as they assert, in training themselves to preach to the world by their example. &#x2026; I do not know many of the particulars of their life at M&#xE9;nilmontant; but it appears that one feature of it is to do without domestic servants, which they consider a vestige of slavery: &#x26; they take their turns to perform all menial offices for one another&#x201D; (Mineka, XII, 106).</note> Figure Duveyrier, with waiter&#x2019;s apron, emptying slop-pails,&#x2014;for <pb id="pg-06-175" n="06:175"/>the salvation of a world. But so it is: many must try, before one can succeed: what too are we but trials; seekers, smoothing the way for others, who likewise will not wholly <hi rend="italic">find?</hi> The men are to be honoured and loved in this, that they have dared to be men, as they could, tho&#x2019; the <hi rend="small-caps">Gig</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The symbol of shallow respectability.</note> should break altogether down with them, and nothing remain for it but bare soles. Such a feat is too hard for above one in ten thousand; yet for all except very fortunate men, it is the first condition of true worth. As to the Saint-Simonian sect, it seems nearly sure to die with the existing &#x201C;Father of Humanity&#x201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The name given to Enfantin.</note> but in his hands it may hold together, and do much indirect good. While &#x201C;the Fancy&#x201D; remain in England unwhipt and without hemp-mallets in their hands,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Fancy,&#x201D; a term for those associated with the prize-ring, here used with Carlylean overtones suggesting that they are also useless members of the upper class. A &#x201C;hemp mallet&#x201D; would be used by prisoners in jail for beating hemp to detach the fiber.</note> let the St. Simonians remain unlaughed at.</p>
<p>You act the good Samaritan&#x2019;s part in visiting Glen. Whether any effectual help can be afforded him I must admit with you to be uncertain: but it is said, while there is life there is hope. So intense, diseased a feeling of Self I have seen in no sane man; never such faculties of head and heart utterly lamed, and cancelling one another. I love poor Glen, and pity him much: dark days are in store for him, go how it may. And he is alone! Bear with him to the last; suffer much, and be kind,&#x2014;as Charity is.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Cor. 13:4.</note> For myself I am not sure but he is bette<supplied>[r away f]</supplied>rom me. What I had to tell him, he heard, and hav<supplied>[ing heard it,]</supplied><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter damaged and words missing.</note> let us now see whether he will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it, or try to do it.</p>
<p>The Paper is done, and my Wife&#x2019;s frank will hold no more, tho&#x2019; there were multitudes of things to say.&#x2014; I recognised you with much satisfaction in last <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, in the Notice of Bentham. Brave Bentham! All week I have thought of that Dissecting-table with a feeling of solemnity.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bentham had died on <date when="1832-06-06">6 June</date>. Mill&#x2019;s &#x201C;Death of Jeremy Bentham&#x201D; had appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1832-06-10">10 June</date>, pp. 371&#x2013;72. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1832-06-11">11 June</date>, reported that on <date when="1832-06-09">9 June</date>, in accordance with Bentham&#x2019;s wish, Dr. Southwood Smith delivered a lecture over his body at the anatomical school, Webb St., and on <date when="1832-06-11">11 June</date> an anatomical lecture by Dr. R. D. Grainger was given, accompanied by dissection. Bentham&#x2019;s skeleton and mummified head were preserved, and are still to be seen at University College, London, dressed in his usual clothes.</note> &#x201C;A Character is a completely fashioned Will.&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quoted from Novalis&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">Fragments</hi>.

<ps><p><pb id="pg-06-176" n="06:176"/>Your Corn Law Rhymes were sent off to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (for the Longmans) nearly three weeks ago. From Napier I yet hear nothing, and incline to fancy my Radicalism has brought him to a Stillstand: be you also silent.&#x2014; Along with the Rhymes, my Wife sent her Novels, which she had read with interest. It were unpardonable (tho&#x2019; she is long since asleep) not to send you her kind regards: she speaks of no one oftener, or with <hi rend="italic">truer</hi> regard.&#x2014; Will you thank Mrs Austin for the little Note, which I wished only to have been longer: also tell me (as I hope you can) that she has got well.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here are the Corrected Proofs<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of &#x201C;Corn-Law Rhymes.&#x201D;</note> for your inspection. I am sorry to hear of your strait (literally a <hi rend="italic">strait</hi>); but find no passage in this Article which could be cut out without <hi rend="italic">great loss of blood</hi>. Solely, if you are so hard run that half a page will make any difference, that Extract, in page 9. beginning with &#x201C;as traceable&#x201D; and ending with &#x201C;Sepulchre of all below&#x201D; might be clipped off: it will do <hi rend="italic">me</hi> little hurt; but the poor Rhymer some, being one of his finest passages. Another stave in page 17 beginning with &#x201C;Light! all is not corrupt,&#x201D; ending <pb id="pg-06-177" n="06:177"/>with &#x201C;their Maker best&#x201D;&#x2014;might also be sacrificed to necessity;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The passages, which were retained by Napier, are in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 146&#x2013;47, 156&#x2013;57.</note> but nothing else that I see; and perhaps those fractions are beneath your notice. I hope so.</p>
<p>Mr Southey, I hear, is about reviewing this same Rhymer in the Quarterly Review; and has entered into some correspondence with him.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Southey and Elliott had been in sporadic correspondence from <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date> to <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>, and Southey, having detected him as the author of the anonymous <hi rend="italic">Corn Law Rhymes</hi> &#x201C;by internal evidence,&#x201D; wrote about his poetry in a paper entitled &#x201C;On the Corn Laws.&#x201D; All the political part was published in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>, LI (<date when="1834-03-00">March 1834</date>), 228&#x2013;83, but the pages on Elliott were cut out. Southey was disgusted with his treatment. The part on Elliott appeared in Elliott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">More Verse and Prose</hi> (<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), II, 81&#x2013;116.</note> The man is named Reuben Elliott, was bred an actual hammerman or something of the sort, and now, rather improved in circumstances, keeps some little hardware shop.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill in his letter of <date when="1832-05-29">29 May</date> had mistakenly said that the author of <hi rend="italic">Corn Law Rhymes</hi> was &#x201C;a real working man, named Reuben Elliott&#x201D; (Mineka, XII, 104).</note> I scarcely hope, there will <hi rend="italic">much</hi> more or better come out of him; but it seems right that thus much should be recognised. I fancy myself to have done and induced you to do an act of <hi rend="italic">Duty</hi>, in wishing God-speed (which is all the furtherance one can give) to so brave a Pilgrim. We shall see where he next arrives; whether he will not <hi rend="italic">revolve</hi> in Political Unions, and <hi rend="italic">arrive</hi> no farther: that is to be feared.</p>
<p>Thanks for your attention to my recommendation, which naturally in those circumstances fell to the ground. I shall be very happy to learn that Sir William is appointed, for whom I also have a great value.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Because of differences between the Senatus and the patrons (the Town Council) the duties of University Secretary, for which Carlyle had already asked Napier to recommend John Gordon, were to be divided (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320528-TC-MN-01">TC to MN, <date when="1832-05-28">28 May</date></ref>). There was to be a General Secretary for the University and an academic Senatus Secretary who was to be a professor. These appointments were not made until <date when="1833-01-00">Jan. 1833</date>, when Gordon was made General Secretary and Sir William Hamilton Senatus Secretary.</note></p>
<p>Thanks too for your promise about Books: this pray do not forget. I am often wonderfully circumstanced here for Books; like an old Hebrew doomed to make Bricks, and no straw allowed him!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Exod. 5:6&#x2013;18.</note> This is a great evil under the Sun. Why is there not a &#x201C;Majesty&#x2019;s Library&#x201D; in every county town? There is a Majesty&#x2019;s Jail and Gallows there already. You, who know thoroughly about this matter, should stir up the world to think of it.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-178" n="06:178"/>The &#x201C;three perfect copies&#x201D; I have marked on the top of the Proof: if you can send that Address to Mr Black&#x2019;s, the people will know how to forward them, with the Review, or whatever else at any time.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You shall have a short Note from me, tho&#x2019; my <hi rend="italic">Task</hi> should stand half done all night. Peter Austin, I expect, will take you this on Monday; and tell you all about our Peat-leading, and what not: but I imagine you will not dislike a word under my own hand also.</p>
<p>Thank Jane for her Letter: it gave us great relief to know that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were getting into your natural way again; that the rest were all in theirs. Let us hope this good state of matters still holds. As for yourself, I think you must go and have a plunge in the Solway this fine weather: when I come down next, I will try to keep an eye on the Moon; bring the <hi rend="italic">Clatch</hi> with me, and roll you along therein myself. I too want much to be bathed.</p>
<p>We are all going on as you saw us, or better. Jane is a little out of sorts these two or three days, but in general seems clearly improving. The Boy has cleaned the Garden (which looks well now), and is at this moment slashing (like a Waterloo hero) among the nettle and dock Hosts over the paling: I hope they will not smother him up, but that his little arm and blunt hook will cut a way thro&#x2019; them. Betty has got &#x201C;Noolly&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The cow which had been sent away when the Carlyles went to London.</note> back again,&#x2014;little improved in <hi rend="italic">temper</hi>, she says. Soft grass will soften her.</p>
<p>As for myself I am doing my utmost; and <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> (as you counselled) not to &#x201C;make it too high.&#x201D; In spite of &#x201C;the Taylors applauses,&#x201D; I find myself but a handless workman too often, and can only get on by a dead struggle. This thing<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Goethe&#x2019;s Works,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, X (<date when="1832-08-00">August 1832</date>), 1&#x2013;44. The editor, J. G. Cochrane, had written on <date when="1832-06-27">27 June</date> to urge Carlyle to speed up work on the article.</note> I calculate will be over in two weeks; and so the stone rolled from my heart again&#x2014;for a little. I mean to run over, and ask what you are doing shortly after: most probably I will <pb id="pg-06-179" n="06:179"/><hi rend="italic">write</hi> first, by Notman. For the rest, I am well enough, and cannot complain while <hi rend="italic">busy</hi>. I go riding every fair morning; sometimes as early as six, and enjoy this blessed <date when="1832-06-00">June</date> weather; oftenest over in the Galloway side, the road being open and good now. My Beast is wholly satisfactory; learns fast to <hi rend="italic">ride</hi>, is already a good canterer: tame quiet and <hi rend="italic">biddable</hi> as horse ever was. The Boy has had it in the cart too, and finds no difficulty in handling it. So dear Mother, on <hi rend="italic">that</hi> hand, set your heart at rest.</p>
<p>No <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> came this week: I have charged Alick to send you over the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> by Peter. The following week, you will find either it or something at the Postoffice at the usual time. Any way there is no news of moment. The poor old King has been hit (by a solitary Blackguard) with a stone; Wellington was peppered with &#x201C;mud and dead cats&#x201D; along the whole length of London: I am sad for him, yet cannot but laugh to think of the business; the cast-metal man riding slowly five long miles, <supplied>[along]</supplied> the way like a pillar of <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [mud]!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> (<date when="1832-06-20">20 June</date>) uses a report in the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> that on Monday, <date when="1832-06-18">18 June</date>, Wellington had been pelted with mud on riding from Mile End Road to Apsley House with a stop (perhaps unwisely) at Sir Charles Wetherell&#x2019;s, to wait for police protection. Then it reported (<date when="1832-06-23">23 June</date>) that Dennis Collins, a destitute one-legged sailor, had thrown a stone which hit the King on the forehead, at Ascot. He was tried and sentenced to death for high treason (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1832-08-23">23 Aug.</date>) but transported instead to Australia, where he died on <date when="1833-11-01">1 Nov. 1833</date> as a result (the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1834-06-08">8 June 1834</date>, p. 361, reported) of a hunger-strike.</note> Every beast <supplied>[you]</supplied> see, has its burden; every dog its day.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Peter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Austin of Carstammon, the brother of James Austin, Carlyle&#x2019;s brother-in-law.</note> volunteers to take anything down with him; and I will not let him go without a little Line for you. I had some thoughts of sending your money by him; but have forborne, as I hope to bring it <hi rend="italic">in my own hand</hi> before we be much older: if you need it in the interim, it will be a pity; but I hope not.</p>
<p>There was no <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> this week; so I have written the Scotsbrig people that you will let them have the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> when their visitors arrive there, which I suppose will be at least as soon as the usual time for the Newspaper. If my London man do not perform better, I must take some new course with it.</p>
<p>Your Note with the Scotsbrig inclosure got hither that same night; greatly to our satisfaction, to learn that all was well with you. With us too, as Peter will explain, Craigenputtoch &#x2018;stands where it did&#x2019;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, IV, iii.</note> with little change&#x2014;except that there is a considerable <hi rend="italic">Peat-stack</hi> now happily added to its other edifices. The fuel is good stuff, and was well got in.</p>
<p>Jane is complaining still; yet undoubtedly in the way of mending. I myself, as you understand, have been the busiest man since we parted; <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> what I could: am now in the very heart of it; and think other <hi rend="italic">ten days</hi> will show me daylight on the farther side; at all events two weeks: so that, say in three weeks, you are most likely to see me in Annandale again. If Jane come with me, we will make for Catlinns <hi rend="italic">first</hi>.&#x2014; I have the old still existence, which you know so well here; am quite quiet with it, and happy enough while I am busy. If little good, neither does much evil come to ruffle our solitude: let us be thankful. This is my <hi rend="italic">workshop</hi>, where there is <hi rend="italic">room</hi> for my Toolbench to stand, and let me work a little: the Earth can yield no man any more than this same thing, better or worse in some small degree.&#x2014; I have never got eye on M&#x2019;Adam<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph M&#x2019;Adam (or Macadam), the new tenant of Craigenputtoch.</note> since I wrote; and know not, at this moment, whether he is within the four seas, or perhaps <pb id="pg-06-181" n="06:181"/>gone to the Continent &#x2018;with <hi rend="italic">beass</hi>&#x2019;,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly &#x201C;beasts.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;tho&#x2019; that is not likely. Let him and his &#x2018;Plea&#x2019; go their gate, in the meanwhile: they will not for long go to ruinous lengths. I find him a very harmless neighbour; the best I could expect, as often for whole weeks I can forget that he exists at all.&#x2014; Th<supplied>[e]</supplied> grey mare gives complete satisfaction: a most ge<supplied>[ntle]</supplied> Beast; <hi rend="italic">comes</hi> to be caught when you go for it; refuses no kind of work, will soon be a quite superior rider, agrees with its grass, and troubles no one. So that your journey for me to Longtown<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Cumberland.</note> was not labour in vain; but will often come gratefully to remembrance.&#x2014; There is no word from Jack; but such may come soon: I think he must be lying by till he have heard from <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> in which case we may wait two weeks yet.&#x2014; Send me up a &#x2018;scrape of a pen&#x2019; by Peter: how you are (little Jean included), what you are doing. I could have you a few larchsticks<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Used for staking, in the garden, or for fencing.</note> ready <hi rend="italic">directly</hi>, if you could come for them. God bless you, dear Brother!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>
<ps><p>The <hi rend="italic">Corn Law Rhymes</hi> Article <hi rend="italic">has</hi> gone to Press, and a pithy thing it is. I will try what I can to get you specially a copy. This on <hi rend="italic">Goethe</hi>, I fear, will be worth little.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I went out last night, after a hard day&#x2019;s work, to enjoy the twilight on our Moor-road; a woman came in sight, and I thought she <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have a letter from you; as accordingly she had, for tho&#x2019; she passed without giving it me, I found it lying on the table at my return!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1832-06-11">11 June</date>.</note> A happy arrival; for I had been hypochondriacal a little on your account: alas, how much more may you be so, when I had waited just six weeks, you four months! Really, this business of Foreign mails is the most vexatious of its sort: I have written either four or five times without once reaching you, and the last two Letters have taken up my whole first page explaining what was sent, and how. Which latter thing I will not do again; but explain merely that all was directed to <pb id="pg-06-182" n="06:182"/>Mr Burrell&#x2019;s care at Florence, except the last, which went by post <hi rend="italic">towards</hi> Naples, above five weeks ago. I bethink me too that most of the other things were consigned to the Foreign Office; but then thro&#x2019; William Fraser&#x2019;s hands, who I fear has proved again &#x2018;unfortunate&#x2019;; so I will try the Advocate with this; and make him do it with <hi rend="italic">emphasis</hi>. Would that it were in your hands: for I see you are given to thoughtfulness, and what melancholy possibilities have you! Meanwhile, let us <hi rend="italic">write on:</hi> there is nothing else for it. Accordingly, this night (tho&#x2019; busier than I almost ever was, being <hi rend="italic">hunted</hi> by Editors) I have shoved my long sheets aside, and give you another earliest chance. Nay, I have done a good <hi rend="italic">task</hi> too (four pages, since six in the morning); so need not grumble, tho&#x2019; bilious enough. I am writing a long paper for the F. Quarterly Review on <hi rend="italic">Goethe&#x2019;s Works</hi>.</p>
<p>First, then, dear Brother, understand that nothing has gone amiss: we are all well, and where we were. I heard from Scotsbrig a week ago (and wrote since), and all was right on that side too. Our Mother was here with us for a fortnight, not quite three weeks ago, and I took her down in the Gig; by Alick&#x2019;s too, in whose Catlinns House and Farm we found all prosperous. He was making a Gate when we came up the <foreign>brae</foreign>, but soon threw down his axes, in delight to see us. It is thought he has not changed for the worse, and may do <hi rend="italic">well</hi> in the Water of Milk; which he looks like doing, for there is a great improvement in him, and increase not only of gravity but of earnest sense and courage. His little girl is a queer <foreign><hi rend="italic">gleg</hi></foreign> [alert] crowing creature; whom he takes much delight in. Jamie too and the sisters are doing well, and seem to go on judiciously enough together; the farm rather doing well, and a proper enough spirit seeming to pervade all of them. Our good Mother is very serious, almost sad (as she may well be); yet not unhealthy, not altogether heavy of heart: she has her trust on what cannot <hi rend="italic">die</hi>. All seem impressed with the necessity of bearing her burden, so far as they may, and I doubt not she feels this. One bright moment she shall have, the night after tomorrow (or next morning rather), when she gets your Letter, the unusual delay of which I accounted for to her by what proved to be the truth, your waiting for news from me. And so much for Annandale; where you see there are, as our Mother piously says, many mercies still allotted us.</p>
<p>As to Craigenputtoch, it is, as formerly, the scene of scribble-scribbling. Jane is in a weakly way still, but I think clearly gathering strength. Her Life beside me constantly writing here is but a dull one: however, she seems to desire no other; has, in many things, pronounced the word <foreign><hi rend="italic">Entsagen</hi></foreign> [Renunciation], and looks with a brave <pb id="pg-06-183" n="06:183"/>if with no joyful heart into the present and the future. She manages all things: poultry, flowers, bread-loaves; keeps a house still like a bandbox: then reads; or works (as at present) on some Translation from Goethe. I tell her many times there is <hi rend="italic">much</hi> for her to do, if she were trained to it: her whole Sex to deliver from the bondage to Frivolity Dollhood and Imbecillity into the freedom of Valour and Womanhood. Our piano is quite out of tune, and little better than a stocking-frame; this is an evil not remediable just yet, so we must want music. We have a Boy-servant named M&#x2019;Whir, a brisk, wise little fellow, who can scour knives, weed carrot-beds, yoke gigs, trim saddle-horses, go errands, and cart coals: a very <foreign>factotum</foreign> of a Boy,&#x2014;at the rate of one sovereign per <hi rend="italic">semestre</hi>. He brings the horses round every favourable morning (Alick and Jamie got <hi rend="italic">me</hi> a noble &#x2018;grey mare&#x2019; at Longtown) and Jane and I go off riding, for which we have now <hi rend="italic">two</hi> roads the Glaisters Hill one being re-made and smoothed, and a Bridge just about built over the Orr.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The River Urr.</note> Our weather, in these mornings, would hardly do discredit to Italy itself. Furthermore, a huge stack of the blackest Peats was built up for us (by Peter Austin) last week; M&#x2019;Whir has cleaned the Garden (full of roses now), has hewed down innumerable nettle- and dock -weeds in the &#x2018;new wood&#x2019; (where some of the trees are quite high), and is busy this day weeding the &#x2018;hedge&#x2019; and the walk. We have had no visits but one of a day from John Welsh of Liverpool, who seemed happy and fished in the Orr. I have work enough, respect more than I deserve; am not without Thoughts from time to time: and so <hi rend="italic">we</hi> play our part. Of my Writings this is the list: one often mentioned on <hi rend="italic">Samuel Johnson</hi> (a copy of which was sent, but I fear will not reach you), which you will one day read with a little pleasure; a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Trauerrede</hi></foreign> [Funeral oration], also often mentioned, on the Death of Goethe, printed in Bulwer&#x2019;s Magazine, never (yet) paid for, or seen by me in print; a speculative-radical Discussion of some &#x2018;Corn-Law Rhymes&#x2019; (bold enough, yet with an innocent smile on its countenance) of which I corrected the Proof (24 pages) the week before last, for Napier; finally this thing I am now at the 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi> page of on <hi rend="italic">Goethe&#x2019;s Works</hi>, a <hi rend="italic">barocque</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] incongruous concern, which I am principally anxious to get <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;Finished the Article <hi rend="italic">Goethe&#x2019;s Werke</hi>, yesterday <date when="1832-07-06">July 6</date>, Saturday Night (in great haste): this night it is in the Coach office Dumfries.&#x2014;A very <hi rend="italic">baroque</hi>, <foreign>un<hi rend="italic">gr&#xfc;ndlich</hi></foreign>, on the whole unsatisfactory thing, not without a coarse strength.&#x201D; In a <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> entry for <date when="1832-07-21">21 July</date> he wrote that he had &#x201C;corrected the Article <hi rend="italic">Goethe&#x2019;s Works</hi>, and despatched it yesternight: am now free for new enterprises.&#x201D;</note> James Fraser <pb id="pg-06-184" n="06:184"/>is again willing to employ me (tho&#x2019; at that double rate), the people having praised <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>. With the Editorial world, in these mad times, I stand at present on quite tolerable footing. I mean to be in Edinburgh some time before very long, and keep matters going. Here too let me mention that I am at no loss for money myself, and have safely received your remittance of &#xa3;100,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320522-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-05-22">22 May</date></ref>.</note> and written to Alick that I will bring it down with me next time, or send it sooner; to Jeffrey I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> write a fit message on the same subject tomorrow, and hope next time I write to give you a satisfactory account of my whole Stewardship. All friends were touched with a kind of <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> [sorrowful] joy to see as I said &#x2018;The colour of Jack&#x2019;s money,&#x2019; after so many misventures and foiled struggles. Poor Jack will be himself again, in spite of all that; and make the world stand about, stiff as it is, and make a little (straight) pathkin for him. Fear it not. You are already free of debt, and in that the miserablest of all millstones is rolled from off you. I too expect to pay the Advocate his money (perhaps along with yours), then I too shall owe no man anything. Anti-gigmanism is the fixed unalterable Athanasian creed<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A creed named after St. Athanasius (ca. <date when="0296-00-00">296</date>&#x2013;<date when="0373-00-00">373</date>) which was the subject of much controversy on account of its uncompromising dogmatism about the Trinity and the tenet that all who do not &#x201C;hold the Catholic Faith &#x2026; shall eternally perish.&#x201D;</note> of this house; Jane is almost stronger in it (and in Anti-fine-ladyism) than myself: so while the fingers will wag, and the head and heart are uncracked, why should we care? The world is a thing that a man must learn to despise and even to neglect before he can learn to reverence it, and work in it and for it.</p>
<p>Of external persons or news we hear or see little. Mrs Strachey sent an apologetic little Letter to Jane<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1832-06-07">7 June</date>. Mrs. Strachey wrote to Jane: &#x201C;I can assure you with the greatest truth that it has been a great disappointment to me to think that you have been in England &#x26; even in my near neighborhood without our meeting. But the awful events through which I was passing [the death of her husband] during the latter part of your stay in London did alas too inevitably preclude my taking any steps for making your acquaintance. I received M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s kind note just as you were leaving town, &#x26; must now beg him to accept my thanks for it. I always feel sure of his Sympathy through whatever State I may be passing, for he is one of the few beings I have met with in this world who can understand properly, &#x26; respond appropriately to the expression of individual feeling.&#x201D;</note> the other week: she was just leaving Shooter&#x2019;s Hill, and about settling in Devonshire, I think, at Torquay. She is earnest, sad, but not broken or dispirited. From John Mill I had a kind sheet of news and speculations:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1832-05-29">29 May</date>. See Mineka, XII, 102&#x2013;7.</note> he was in the habit of visiting Glen (of whom my theory agreed with his), and would <pb id="pg-06-185" n="06:185"/>continue it, so long as the practice gave the passive party pleasure. Poor Glen! His Mother (Corson tells us here) took to drinking, and broke his Father&#x2019;s heart: who knows what perversion of structure from such misarrangement may have passed over to their son. Mrs. Austin wrote lately that Goethe&#x2019;s last words were <foreign><hi rend="italic">Macht die Fensterladen auf, damit ich mehr Licht bekomme</hi></foreign> [Open the shutters so that I may have more light]! Glorious man! Happy man! I never think of him but with reverence and pride. Jeremy Bentham is dead, and <hi rend="italic">made</hi> his body be lectured over in some of their anatomical schools by Southwood Smith, I think.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320616-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1832-06-16">16 June</date></ref>.</note> You have likely seen this in the papers; also that Sir Walter Scott lies struck with apoplexy, deprived of consciousness, and expected inevitably to die,&#x2014;at a Hotel in Jermyn Street! He has a son and daughter there too; and dies in an inn: I could almost cry for it.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott lay for about three weeks in his hotel in Jermyn Street in London, much of the time in a coma. But on <date when="1832-07-07">7 July</date> he was put on a steamboat which carried him to Scotland. Soon after he was at Abbotsford, where he died on <date when="1832-09-21">21 Sept</date>.</note> O all-devouring <hi rend="italic">Time!</hi> O unfathomable <hi rend="italic">Eternity!</hi>&#x2014; Edward Irving is out of his Chapel, and seems to be preaching often in the fields. He has rented Owen&#x2019;s huge ugly Bazaar (they say) in Grey&#x2019;s Inn Road, at 7 guineas a week, and lectures there every morning: Owen the Atheist, and Irving the Gift-of Tongueist time about <supplied>[by turns]</supplied>: it is a mad world.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After being barred from the Regent Sq. Caledonian Chapel, Irving engaged premises at the Horse Bazaar, Gray&#x2019;s Inn Road, which he had to share with Robert Owen, thus exhibiting (as the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> for <date when="1832-05-05">5 May</date> gleefully commented) &#x201C;perhaps, the strangest conjunction that ever design or accident produced. The former will give his &#x2018;new readings&#x2019; of the Apocalypse, with occasional interludes on &#x2018;the tongues&#x2019;; and the other his &#x2018;new view of society,&#x2019; with a little fiddling and a sixpenny hop, &#x2018;for the benefit of the working class.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> Who our poor friend&#x2019;s audience are I hear not: it is said, many even of his women have given in. Some of his adherents seem to come before the Police occasionally, when they gather crowds on the street. His Father, worthy old Gavin, was taken away, a few days ago, from sight of these perversities: his decease was mentioned in the last Dumfries Courier.&#x2014; Electioneering goes on here; in which I take no interest, more than in a better or worse terrier-fight: Reform-Bill-ing is the universal business, not mine. This then ought to satisfy thee, O Doctor, in regard to the item of news.</p>
<p>I will now say a word on Neapolitan matters, and venture on another half-sheet. It agreed with my conjecture that Lady Clare will be for retaining you another year: I think also that, in such case, it <pb id="pg-06-186" n="06:186"/>will be decidedly your advantage to comply. That recluse speculative life is, no doubt, not the natural one for you: yet that too has its profitableness, if you turn it to profit; and, in any case, the <hi rend="italic">money</hi> you earn will be of essential help. We shall all be anxious to know how the business settles itself; but study, as you are doing, to be <foreign><hi rend="italic">in utrumque paratus</hi></foreign> [ready for either event].<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, II, 61.</note> I have not, and have never had, any doubt about your clear ability to do a faithful man&#x2019;s part, in this world, were you once <hi rend="italic">clearly</hi> determined on it: with money or without it, a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> can never be nonplussed. Meanwhile, it were well to be meditating, with earnest practical sense, on what your future procedure is to be: we hope, you will come over, in the first-place, whenever you return to Britain (<foreign><hi rend="italic">ach! wann?</hi></foreign> [oh! when?]), and see us all here; that we may participate in your schemes, and do our utmost, were it only by good wishes, to forward you therein, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Froher Muth in festem Sinn</hi></foreign> [cheerful courage in a firm mind]!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle mixes up a line from one of Goethe&#x2019;s early lyrics &#x201C;Menschengef&#xfc;hl,&#x201D; usually dated about <date when="1775-00-00">1775</date> or <date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>: <foreign>Ach ihr G&#xF6;tter! gr&#xF6;sse G&#xF6;tter In dem weiten Himmel droben!

<p>I wholly understand your internal contentions, at this period; struggling, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Verwerfen</hi></foreign> [discarding] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Aufnehmen</hi></foreign> [picking up] that you have.

<salute>My Dear Eckermann,</salute>
<p>It was the will of one now departed, but ever dear to both of us, that our intimacy should not cease with his death, but be drawn closer thereby: let his will, in this as in all things, be done! To me whatsoever has pertained to him becomes now doubly precious; his glorious Existence, which I nowise figure as terminated or terminable, but only as withdrawn from our bodily sight, still walks before me as my Pillar of Fire by day and Pillar of Cloud by night,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Exod. 13:21.</note> hallowing with quite peculiar sacredness all that environs it. In the whole living world, there is perhaps no man that loves him more faithfully than we two: shall not this be a bond between us; a holy memorial, whensoever, thro&#x2019; what yet remains of our pilgrimage, Destiny may bring us near each other? Germany is now grown to me almost a Necropolis, <pb id="pg-06-188" n="06:188"/>and silent <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gottesacker</hi></foreign> [grave yard], with only the tombs of my loved ones left for me there: among its many busy millions, still working and walking alive, there are few I have so much to do with as with yourself. Let me hear of you, from time to time; let us see each other, if either of us ever cross the German Channel: let us both live mindful of our spiritual Father, mindful also of one another as his common sons, and above all, <hi rend="italic">worthy</hi> of such a relation!</p>
<p>For the last three months, I have been in constant expectation of a Letter from some of you: but now begin to suspect that there has been some misfortune on my own side of the Correspondence.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His last letter to Goethe has not been found.</note> My last Letter from the Poet was received in London eight or nine months ago: I continued there (joined by my Wife) all winter; in such an uncertain state of bustle and excitement that Spring and the time of my return was at hand, before I could compose myself to write an Answer. A long Answer, however, was written, some time about the <date when="1832-03-20">twentieth of March</date>; wherein all that I had been doing and considering was sketched out: my sad astonishment at much I had seen in London, active and speculative; my joy to escape out of it, and think my own thought, and go my own path, once more among the Mountains. I concluded, I remember, by earnestly requesting a Letter; said, &#x201C;I should not feel at home again till a Weimar message and welcome reached me there.&#x201D; Alas! There were no more such messages appointed me. I was met at Dumfries by tidings that my Friend had gone into Eternity; that I should hear his voice &#x201C;no more again at all forever.&#x201D; My Letter should have reached Weimar about a week after his decease; at the hour of that great event, I was about Liverpool on the road hither. It seemed to me, that day the news found me, as if a Sun had gone out: I did not weep; my feeling was not sad only, but high and solemn, not of mourning only, but of victory and triumph. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">So stirbt ein Held: anbetungsvoll</hi></foreign> [So dies a hero: sight to be worshipped]!&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320408-TC-MN-01">TC to MN, <date when="1832-04-08">8 April</date></ref></note></p>
<p>The public mind, even in England, agitated as we are with politics and what not, was nowise insensible to this occurrence: within the next three days, I had three several applications, to write upon it, from Editors of Periodicals. My mood, at the time, was not for writing or speech, but for Silence. After some weeks I relieved myself and gratified some friends with a little Funeral Oration, published in the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly London Magazine</hi>, which I wish I had any means of <pb id="pg-06-189" n="06:189"/>sending you. It is entitled &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Death of Goethe</hi>,&#x201D; and stands, I think, in the <date when="1832-05-00">May</date> or <date when="1832-06-00">June</date> Number.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1832-06-00">June</date>.</note> Of late I have occupied myself in writing a long rhapsodical Essay under the rubrick &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Goethe&#x2019;s Works</hi>&#x201D; for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review:</hi> it will be in Germany ere long, and may perhaps come under your eye. My other speculations, since you last heard of me, have been mostly on English topics; tho&#x2019;, I hope, somewhat in the German spirit.</p>
<p>As no Message arrives from any one in Weimar, I now begin to believe that my last Letter, which could never reach the hand it was addressed to, has altogether miscarried; and both to you and to Madam von Goethe<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Widow of Goethe&#x2019;s son, August.</note> my silence must seem questionable. Let this hurried sheet deliver us from such misunderstanding: assure the now doubly widowed Ottilie of our deepest sympathy; say, on my Wife&#x2019;s part and mine, that her welfare will always be a matter of heartfelt interest to us; that it were a true satisfaction could she write to us, and so, by the imperfect medium of Letters, the best that is open for us, keep up a friendly neighbourhood.</p>
<p>For yourself, you must not neglect to write, and that soon. How much have you to tell me! All, all, is quite unknown; nothing beyond one short paragraph in the Newspapers, about an event that must be forever important to me! A Lady<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Sarah Austin, in a letter to Carlyle which has not been found. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320616-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1832-06-16">16 June</date></ref>.</note> copies me a Letter from Germany, with details of the Death-hour, which I dwell on with a sad joy, which you must confirm or correct for me. Nothing, no smallest matter, that relates to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> can be too small for me. Tell me his <hi rend="italic">last word</hi>, if you know it; assure me that his Departure was soft and blessed, as of one entering into that Land of Light whither his earthly Life had been a faithful journeying.</p>
<p>As to me, I am once more settled here, and at my work; minded to follow it as faithfully as I may, let the times be never so contradictory. Contradiction is the lot of man; out of Contradiction he is here to bring Reconcilement. I had a Manuscript with me in London; purposing to have it converted into a Book. So distracted was the state of Literature, as I found it, that I soon desisted from this enterprise; and my Manuscript is again here with me still manuscript. I have some thoughts of taking it to Edinburgh this winter, and there printing it at my own charges. Our Bookselling world is evidently drawing to its latter end; and it will be long before a <hi rend="italic">new method</hi> can <pb id="pg-06-190" n="06:190"/>establish itself, tho&#x2019; establish itself it must. So soon as I get into print, you if possible shall have a copy.</p>
<p>During these present days I have been revising an old Translation of <hi rend="italic">Das M&#xE4;hrchen</hi>,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Tale, by Goethe&#x201D; was published in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, VI (<date when="1832-10-00">Oct. 1832</date>), 257&#x2013;78; collected in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 447&#x2013;79.</note> and attempting to comment on it a little; with intent to send it forth to our World. The number of minds to whom it will have some significance in this country is constantly and rapidly increasing. To me it seems one of the noblest Poems or Prophecies produced for many ages; inexhaustible in meaning, deeper every new time I look into it. If you know any Commentary in German worth looking at, neglect not to point it out to me. The kind Author once promised my Wife such a one: but now from his hand it can never come.&#x2014; Write to me soon, and forget me not. My Wife unites with me in truest regards to you, to Ottilie and her Children, and all that were dear to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. His Portrait still hangs beside us: she says, he does not seem dead, but only removed to a greater distance and become immortal. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wie das Gestirn, ohne Hast, aber ohne Rast</hi></foreign> [Like the star, without haste, but without rest]!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310610-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1831-06-10">10 June 1831</date></ref>.</note> So be it.</p>

<p>I gave a young Englishman, Henry Reeve,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Reeve (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>), journalist, man of letters, clerk of appeal to the judicial committee of the privy council (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>) and its registrar (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1887-00-00">87</date>); nephew of Mrs. Sarah Austin.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Good wife Macadam brought us your Letter of the <date when="1832-07-04">4<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> from church with her on Sunday evening: it is the way the three last have happened to come; so we shall begin to esteem it a happy omen when our neighbour thinks of getting a sermon. God be thanked it is all right; you are well and have now heard that we are well! Another Letter sent off thro&#x2019; the Advocate by the Foreign Office will be already in your hands: we shall henceforth eschew Will<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Fraser as we would the Genius of Impotence itself, and trust mainly to the Post, which tho&#x2019; it has loitered has never yet absolutely deceived us. I lament for poor Fraser; a worthy friendly creature; but whose utter unpunctuality, in a world <hi rend="italic">built</hi> on Time, will frustrate every endeavour he may engage in,&#x2014;except the last, that of quitting Life, which probably will be transacted in <hi rend="italic">right</hi> seasons. I am angry too, as well as sorry: this idle losing of Letters is a stretch of carelessness to which even the peasants of Glenessland<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Glenesslin is the valley at the head of which stands Craigenputtoch farm, while Dunscore is at its foot. Its peasants were those at Sandywells, Nether Craigenputtoch, etc.</note> are superior; entrust any of them with a Letter, he knows it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be attended to. Fraser, to all appearance, has also wasted my last Letter to Goethe: at least no message yet reaches me from Weimar; and I wrote to Eckermann last week on that hypothesis. Fie! Fie! The foolish Fraser. I will ask him, however, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> has become of all these papers; and have them back, if they are not burnt. And now, Doctor, taking to ourselves this practical lesson to be for our share in all things doubly and trebly <hi rend="italic">punctual</hi>, we will leave the &#x2018;unfortunate&#x2019; man, and the thing he has made unfortunate. All is right, <hi rend="italic">at last</hi>.</p>
<p>Both of us were heartily gratified with your Letter. I have the cheering sight before me of a prophecy often pronounced and asserted, realising itself: Jack is to be a man after all. Your outward relations seem all prosperous and well managed; your character is unfolding itself into true self-subsistence: in the work appointed you to do you not only <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> to work, but actually <hi rend="italic">work</hi>. For the rest, let <pb id="pg-06-192" n="06:192"/>us be patient under this delay and separation: <hi rend="italic">both</hi> were perhaps necessary; in any case, if we improve them, will turn to good fruits. I quarrel not with your solitude or with anything you do, so it bring yourself contentment and the feeling of profit: this is the best and only rule you can have. Nevertheless I have always found that companionship, with <hi rend="italic">any</hi> man that will speak out truly his experiences and persuasions (so he have such) was a most precious ingredient in the history of one&#x2019;s life; a thing one turns back to, and finds evermore new meaning in; for indeed this is <hi rend="italic">real</hi>, and therefore inexhaustible (<hi rend="italic">God</hi> made that man you speak with); all else is more or less theoretical and incomplete. Indeed, in every sense, one is but an unhealthy Fraction while alone; only in society with his equals a whole. For which reasons it gratifies me to learn that you make acquaintance with Gell and old <hi rend="italic">Squares</hi> the Doctor.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1832-07-04">4 July</date> John had written: &#x201C;One of these days Mr Mills (a friend of Lady Clare&#x2019;s &#x26; of her brother) will introduce me to Sir William Gell (Troy) &#x26; to Quadri who is the most celebrated physician here. Some good may come of their acquaintance, if I can succeed in giving it any cordiality. Gell knows every thing about Naples very intimately having been here nearly fifteen years; &#x26; Quadri is a cross, humourous, sharp-sighted old man. I meet Quadri to consult about the treatment of one of Mr Mills servants whose eyes are affected with cataract or amaurosis&#x2014;perhaps on monday next.&#x201D; Sir William Gell (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), English archeologist, lived in Italy, where he was a corresponding member of the Society of Dilettanti and wrote extensively on antiquities, including Troy. In <date when="1804-00-00">1804</date> he published <hi rend="italic">The Topography of Troy and its Vicinity</hi> and in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> would publish <hi rend="italic">The Topography of Rome and its Vicinity</hi>. Gian Battista Quadri (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>): Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;Squares&#x201D; is a humorous translation of the name.</note> I could like well to know both of them. Sir W. (<foreign><hi rend="italic">ein Bornirter den man muss gelten lassen</hi></foreign> [a narrowminded person whom one must approve of]) will make an excellent Cicerone, can tell you all about Troy too, and who knows w<supplied>[ha]</supplied>t Itineraries; Quadri will satirically show you Italian quackery, and how an adust hot temperament demeans itself therein. I must also esteem it no small felicity you naturally have: that of associating with a thoroughly courteous socially-cultivated woman. No higher piece of Art is there in the world. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schone sie, verehre sie</hi></foreign> [Take care of her, honor her]! Your whole law lies there: the weak lovely one will be loved, honoured and protected: is not in truth a noble woman (noblewoman or not) <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gottes Lieblichste</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">r</hi>]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">Gedanke</hi></foreign> [God&#x2019;s most pleasing thought], and worth <hi rend="italic">reverencing?</hi> Be diligent with your Journal: note everything, let it seem noteworthy or not. Have no eye towards publication; but only towards self-enlightenment and pleasant recollection: publication, if it seem needful, will follow of its own accord. <pb id="pg-06-193" n="06:193"/>Goethe&#x2019;s Italian Travels<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Italienische Reise</hi> (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1817-00-00">17</date>).</note> are a fine model: <foreign><hi rend="italic">alles rein angeschaut wie es ist und seyn muss</hi></foreign> [everything clearly seen as it is and must be]. I often figure you in the Toledo-street, with lemonade booths and macaroni-cookeries, and loud-singing, loud-speaking multitudes, on the lov<supplied>[e]</supplied>liest spot of Earth&#x2019;s surface: I here on the Glaister&#x2019;s hill side, in the warm dusk, the wilderness all vapoury and silent except a curlew or two, the great Heaven above me; around me only the spirits of the Distant, of the Dead. All has a preternatural character; unspeakably earnest, sad but nowise wretched.&#x2014; You may tell me if you like what German books your Lady reads; and on the whole be more and more minute in picturing out to me the current of your &#x2018;natural Day.&#x2019; I even want to know what clothes you wear, what sort of victual you subsist on.</p>
<p>To turn now the Scottish side of the leaf: I have finished <hi rend="italic">Goethe&#x2019;s Works</hi>, and corrected the Proofs of it, since I wrote: a long desultory, rhapsodic concern of 44 pages in the <hi rend="italic">F.Q. Review</hi>. These are no days for speaking of Goethe. I next went over to Catlinns and Scotsbrig, leaving Jane at Templand (who rued much that she had volunteered to stay behind me). The Catlinns agriculture was all green and prospering: the Farmer with wife and child had gone over to Brand&#x2019;s of Craighouse; whither I followed them; and, strange enough, was shortly after joined by Jamie and my Mother: all engaged that evening to have tea there! Everything was as one could have hoped: crops all excellent, good health, good agreement, good weather. I drove our Mother to Annan next forenoon (in the <hi rend="italic">Clatch</hi>, as we call the old Gig, which the new grey mare briskly draws along); went and bathed there at the &#x201C;Back of the Hill&#x201D; (in the very spot, I think, where I was near drowning, six and twenty years ago;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Wilson, Carlyle, I, 69. Carlyle had been pulled out by his hair, and his mother had made him swear never to venture into deep water again.</note> whither I will not return); found Ben Nelson (it was market-day), dined with him and talked immeasurably all afternoon, tho&#x2019; I had much rather have listened, if he had liked. Ben asked kindly about you; looked clear and free, no grayer than last time. He has lost his Brother Jonathan; his son Edward is at Botany (for Doctorship) at Edinburgh, but coming home soon, and even (as Ben asserted) up hither. James Little I saw walking with an incipient pot-belly; Dr Irving unchanged in look, metallic tone of voice, or hollow courtesy; Thom superintending builders; George Dalgliesh in grey summer coat, a milkfaced married man: to this last I nodded; did not even nod to any of the rest, but <pb id="pg-06-194" n="06:194"/>walked as a ghost at noontide. My Mother was at R. Brown&#x2019;s all the time; the Clatch and mare at Robinson&#x2019;s. Waugh did not turn up anywhere; Devitry is gone elsewhere: such is the medical world. I was at Annan another bathing day, but missed Ben. However, we chanced to meet on Dodbeck heights next Wednesday morning as I was returning home; appointed a rendezvous at our inn, and there over a thimblefull of brandy and water talked again for the space of two stricken hours.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Ben Nelson, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210109-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:304</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1821-01-09">9 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref> and the entry in Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> for <date when="1832-07-21">21 July</date> (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, II, 283); James Little was a notary of High St., Annan; Dr. John Irving, surgeon, of the High St.; George Dalgliesh, shoemaker, of the same; R. Brown was a mason of Port St.; and G. Robinson was of the Buck Inn, High St. Carlyle also refers to Dr. John Smith Waugh. &#x201C;Devitry&#x201D; is unidentified, as are &#x201C;Dodbeck heights.&#x201D;</note> Waugh I now asked for, and heard this strangest history: lying among the pots, forgotten of men, he sees his Aunt Margaret die (poor old Peg!), and himself thereby put in possession of &#xa3;50 as inheritance. Whereupon shaving his beard, and putting on change of raiment, he walks down to&#x2014;Benson&#x2019;s,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Benson, Queensberry Arms, High St.</note> and there orders fodder and stall of the best; reigns among the Bagmen to heart&#x2019;s content; shifts after a season to the King&#x2019;s Arms Dumfries; and there or in some similar establishment is perhaps even now (related Ben) burning his fifty-pound candle to the socket, and going out in stench! Saw mortal ever the like? The man, Doctor, is once for all deprived of understanding the greatest misfortune (properly the only one) that can befal a man. He hath said to the Father of No-work and Darkness: Behold I am thine!&#x2014; Let me mention here more specially before quit<supplied>[t]</supplied>ing Annandale that at Scotsbrig, all was busy and right; hay harvest was at its height the day I came off, and prosperin<supplied>[g]</supplied> well. Our Mother seemed in better than usual health; was delighted with her two <hi rend="italic">bathes</hi>, and should ha<supplied>[ve had another but]</supplied> the Clat<supplied>[ch]</supplied> failed, and needed repair. She said often: &#x201C;I <foreign>kenna</foreign> how many kind things I wanted to bid <supplied>[thee say for]</supplied> me to John; and thou was <foreign>ay gane</foreign> first.&#x201D; I said that you understood them all; and I constan<supplied>[tly wrote with]</supplied> pains about Scotsbrig and her.&#x2014; I am to write thither this night, and send your Letter, as [a word or two missing] use: Alick also I will write to; our Boy is going to exchange horses with him for a week <supplied>[until]</supplied> we get the rest of our coals carted. Our Newspapers go between these households, and sometimes from one to the other: there is all community that we can kept up, frequent messages, constant goodwishes<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>Since I returned, I have been employed translating a little piece <pb id="pg-06-195" n="06:195"/>named <hi rend="italic">Novelle</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published as &#x201C;Fragment, by Goethe,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine,</hi> VI (<date when="1832-11-00">Nov. 1832</date>), 383&#x2013;93; reprinted in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 480&#x2013;96, under title &#x201C;Novelle.&#x201D;</note> from the 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> volume of Goethe, and revising an old translation of <hi rend="small-caps">the</hi> <hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen</hi> with intent to add some commentary; and offer both Papers to James Fraser. I have an Essay to write on <hi rend="italic">Diderot</hi> (for Cochrane) and all his 21 octavos lying here to read first; shall do it, any way, <foreign><hi rend="italic">invita Minerva</hi></foreign> [without inspiration];<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace, <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica,</hi> l. 385; Cicero, <hi rend="italic">De Officiis</hi>, I xxxi.</note> and may as well begin even now. I have upwards of 100 pages to put out of me before winter: stand to it; <foreign><hi rend="italic">nulla dies sine linea</hi></foreign> [no day without a line]!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240121-JBW-TC-01"><sic>3:20</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1824-01-21">21 Jan. 1824</date></corr></ref>. The mood of this paragraph is reflected in Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> for <date when="1832-07-21">21 July</date> (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle,</hi> II, 283&#x2013;84).</note> As to <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi>, he lies quite calm here bound up in twine: my partial purpose is to spend another &#xa3;50 on him, and have him printed by and by myself. I in some measure see thro&#x2019; the matter, not yet wholly. One thing I imagine to be clear enough: that <hi rend="italic">Bookselling</hi>, slain by Puffery, is dead, and will not come alive again, tho worms for some time may live on the carcase. What method writers (who have something to write) shall next take is now the question. In a generation or two, the answer (summed up from the <hi rend="italic">procedure</hi> of wise inventive men) will be forthcoming. To us any way <hi rend="italic">Martyrdom</hi> is the thing appointed; in this and all other generations, only the degree of it, the outward figure of it vary. Thank God, we have still food and vesture, and <hi rend="italic">can</hi> still get a thing spoken out and printed: more we need not covet; more is not necessary. I have a thing to send Napier on all this; but it is <foreign>in petto</foreign> [in my private thoughts] yet. Meanwhile we get along tolerably enough; all, as you fancied, is tight tidy and peaceable here: a flourishing garden (with blackbirds devouring the fruits), even apples a basket or two, roses innumerable: a park walled in (this was poor Alick&#x2019;s last act here) so that the &#x201C;rowan-tree-gate&#x201D; and all gates but the outer one removed, and cow and horses graze at ease: a monstrous peatstack against grim winter: money in one&#x2019;s purse, faith in one&#x2019;s heart: what is there wanting? So we live here: a <foreign><hi rend="italic">wunderliches abgesondertes Wesen</hi></foreign> [curious secluded existence]! Jane drives down to Dumfries tomorrow with the Boy, and takes this Letter. She is far enough from perfect health still; yet certainly improving; she greets you affectionately, was much pleased with your letter,&#x2014; especially that part when you speak so sensibly about <hi rend="italic">a good wife</hi>, and the blessedness she brings!&#x2014; I have some thought that we shall see <supplied>[ourselves]</supplied> in Edinburgh this winter; printing of <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi> and what not. I have Mill, and Mrs Austin Jane has <pb id="pg-06-196" n="06:196"/>occasional correspondents in London: Mill and Glen are acquainted, tho&#x2019; it is mostly on Mill&#x2019;s side; Glen is so <hi rend="italic">fencible</hi> a character, so near madness moreover. Mill&#x2019;s letters are too speculative, but I reckon him an excellent person, and his love to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> is great! He tells me Glen got your Naples letter, was much contented therewith, and well. His other news are: the decease, at least paralysis, of St-Simonism; and London Politics, for which I care less every day. Buller is trying for Lisk<supplied>[e]</supplied>ard Borough, with hopes: the Election will not be for several months; no dissolution till winter.&#x2014; George Irving was at Annan at his Father&#x2019;s funeral, for two days. Edward it seems is summoned to answer for himself before the Annan Presbytery, and will come, and be deposed. The time is near; whether I shall see him, uncertain. He is preaching in the fields about London; at Hampstead Heath, his precentor in a tree (last account I saw): there was also a paragraph about building him a new Church. His old congregation have offered <hi rend="italic">Some</hi>body &#xa3;1000 a year; whether he takes it, not said. The Dows<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Rev. David Dow, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310822-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-22">22 Aug. 1831</date></ref>. The other Dow, his brother, was William (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), minister, educated at Edinburgh University; licensed Presbytery of Dumfries, <date when="1821-11-06">6 Nov. 1821</date>; ordained, Tongland, Kirkcudbright; withdrew his adherence to the standards of the Church and was deposed by the General Assembly, <date when="1832-05-23">23 May 1832</date>.</note> are <hi rend="italic">both</hi> out, the last of them resigned: it is wholly a beastly piece of Ignorance and Stupidity, too stupid even for the gross head of England. That the High, the Holy can find no other lodging than that swinish one is even the misery. God mend it,&#x2014;and us!&#x2014; Tom Holcroft sends us the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> (less punctually than were good); of Badams no news since we left him in Bartlett&#x2019;s Buildings, gone from Enfield, with no good outlook moral or domestic. Poor Badams! <foreign>Wie gern m&#xF6;cht ich Dich retten</foreign> [how I would like to save you]!&#x2014; Graham is still in Glasgow, no tidings could I get of him farther: Burnswark unsold.&#x2014; So goes the world here, dear Brother: the weather is hot; the year is fertile beyond all example; the Simple hope from the Reform Bill; electioneering flourishes, in which I take no interest. Cholera is at Carlisle, and somewhat worse than ever in London: none of us are in the least <hi rend="italic">alarmed</hi> at it; be not you either.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> in Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, II, 285.</note>&#x2014; I have still the margins; but could fill another sheet or two were it here.</p>
<p>I paid Alick &#xa3;45&#x201D;8 of your money, the &#xa3;5&#x201D;8 was a Tailor&#x2019;s account: and you now owe him nothing. I sent Jeffrey word that you had remitted me &#xa3;43&#x201D;10 (specifying the items) to pay him, and that I, not you, was now (till I could get the Dumfries Banker seen) his <pb id="pg-06-197" n="06:197"/>debtor: he answers gratified by your punctuality, and I will now clear him off the first time I am at Dumfries.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I meant at any rate to write you a line tonight, and here comes, on Sabbath from Church, a brave Letter from John, which will make the package better worth carriage. Our good Doctor is well, and has now heard of our welfare: it is altogether a very comfortable Letter. <pb id="pg-06-198" n="06:198"/>I have written him a long Answer today; wherein I failed not to mention how many kind things you <hi rend="italic">wished</hi> to say to him, and that he must <hi rend="italic">imagine</hi> them all. I think we shall certainly see good of the poor Doctor, in spite of everything.</p>
<p>I got up handsomely enough that day; came upon Ben Nelson on Dodbeck <foreign>brae</foreign>, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">scraiched</hi></foreign> [shouted] two or three miles with him (for he was on a pony that would not lead), then said goodb&#x2019;ye, with appointment to meet again in Town; as accordingly we did, and had a long talk together. He told me of Waugh: how old Peg, his Aunt, had died, and left him &#xa3;50; wherewith what does the possessed person do but go off to Benson&#x2019;s and the King&#x2019;s Arms with it, and sit there till he has eaten and drunk the last sixpence of it: then back to unpeeled potatoes and repose! Bray a fool in a mortar, he will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> depart from his folly.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 27:22.</note></p>
<p>M&#x2019;Diarmid&#x2019;s Library business would not answer: so I must try some other Establishment; have yet found none.</p>
<p>Jane was sitting waiting for me, or rather running out half-distracted to meet me: she bids me say she rued right sore not coming on with me, and will surely do so next time. She is still in the way of improvement; proceeding, slowly. We ride, and drive, and drink <hi rend="italic">trefoil</hi> (<hi rend="italic">threefold</hi>) and other bitters, and do the best we can. The weather is very sultry and thirsty; rain would do us good, as well as the grass. Jane goes to Dumfries in the Gig tomorrow with the Boy; a-shopping, and will take this along with her. Isabella M&#x2019;Turk was here about a ten days; a quiet, compliant creature, well adapted for <hi rend="italic">dowrying:</hi> a man came for her yesterday, and now we are by ourselves again.</p>
<p>The peats are all home; a most effectual-looking stack: ninety cartloads to front the winter with. We have got hay too; Rowantree<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified local farmer, presumably named after farm.</note> came and offered me what I wanted at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> a stone; I sent Peter Austin down to inspect the weighing for me, and now the loft is quite chokefull: 180 stones of Rowantree&#x2019;s, and perhaps 50 that was left of Alick&#x2019;s. The horses seem very willing to eat it. On Thursday I mean to send the Boy off for Alick&#x2019;s beast; and down with my own, for there is not grass here; perhaps Alick may send him forward to Scotsbrig if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> have no room for &#x201C;the mare&#x201D;: but that is not likely. We shall then have our summer&#x2019;s work by.</p>
<p>As to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> work, it wears but a sluggish look yet: I have been translating and revising some German things for the Magazine, and am <pb id="pg-06-199" n="06:199"/>now done; a larger task must forthwith be entered on. I must not come back to you, till this be finished: <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I cannot positively say; you shall hear from me how I get on. Would it be quite impossible that some of you should come up hither and see us before shearing-time: say Jane, my valued Correspondent; would nobody take her work for a week; she engaging to do the like for that body some other time? <hi rend="italic">You</hi> said once, you would come when the rasps [raspberries] were ready: now here they are, and the blackbirds eating them all.</p>
<p>In any case, tell Jane to order me a Leghorn (coarse) broad brimmed Hat from the Grahams,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271100-TC-ANM-01"><sic>4:286</sic><corr>TC to ANM, <date when="1827-11-28">28 Nov. 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> to be got ready with all despatch: the measure of my Hat, <hi rend="italic">outside</hi>, is just 2 feet and one half-inch, no more and no less: my <hi rend="italic">shape</hi> (of a <hi rend="italic">flattish</hi> brim, slightly turned up behind) the people already know. Tell her also to write to me with all minuteness very soon. I am taking it for granted that my dear Mother, and the rest of them, are in the usual way: but need from time to time to be assured of it. M&#x2019;Diarmid, who clatters everlastingly, about <hi rend="italic">cholera</hi>, declared last week that it was near you; as indeed it may soon be near us all. It will go its course, and keep <supplied>[the road a]</supplied>ppointed it, and do the work marked out for it: why flutter and fluster ourselves? Did our Great Creator and sure Redeemer send us the cholera; or did some other send it? I think it is a folly even to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> of the subject, unless there is some new light to be thrown on it; such as &#x201C;the able Editor&#x201D; has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to throw. I inclose you, on a [word illegible] a small stave [short song] by Goethe, which &#x201C;occurred in the thing I was translating.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps the song in Goethe&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Tale&#x201D; (see Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 466). There are also several lyrics in Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Novelle</hi>, which Carlyle was translating at this time.</note>&#x2014; Alas, dear Mother, the Paper is done, and I hardly begun. But indeed I know not <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I should <hi rend="italic">end</hi>. I must now out for my <foreign>gloaming-shot</foreign> [twilight interval] on the Glaisters Hill side.&#x2014; May God keep you all! I forget no day to think of you, to <hi rend="italic">pray</hi> for you in my way. Be good and faithful, &#x201C;loving one another,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 13:34 and elsewhere.</note> as it is commanded. <closer><salute>Good night!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I am just in the bustle of setting out to avoid the dirty &#x201C;Gunnerbodies&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grouse hunters, including Robert Welsh and a &#x201C;tag-raggery of Dumfries Writers [lawyers], Dogs, etc. etc.&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 84).</note> and having many things to prepare and adjust, cannot write you more than a line. We had determined on a drive to Kirkchrist;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;To see his old friends the Churches, late of Hitchill&#x201D; (Norton&#x2019;s note).</note> Jane to go with me, if she could: I wrote the people to that effect; and now Jane <hi rend="italic">not</hi> being able to go with me, I must go myself,&#x2014;most <hi rend="italic">reluctantly</hi>, now when it has come to the point! Indeed, I think I would willingly give a couple of guineas, had I liberty to stay quietly at home, and follow my affairs. These wretched Devil&#x2019;s-servants of Gunners! However, I shall try to get round them another year. Meanwhile, this journey, as in spite of all my reluctance I inwardly feel, will do me good. &#x2026;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Norton indicates that he made an omission here, as he does frequently: for instance, he also omits the last paragraph.</note></p>
<p>I have not been idle, at least not at <hi rend="italic">ease</hi>, since we parted; yet the quantity of <hi rend="italic">work done</hi> is very small. I have packed off two little (mostly translated) pieces for Magazine Fraser; this is all I have yet <hi rend="italic">got quit of</hi>. Another thing or two are on the anvil; but in a very rough state. I must not look Annandale in the face till I have done at least one of them. You will hear before then. I have now and then enough ado to keep myself stiffly at work: as you know well, however, there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> other course for one in this lone Desert; where if a man did not work, he might so easily run mad. When vapours of solitude, and longings after the cheerful face of my fellow-man are gathering round me, I dash them off, and the first lusty swing of Industry scatters them away, as Cock-crowing does spectres of the Night. Let not a living man complain! His little Life is given him for the sake of an Eternity: let him <hi rend="italic">stand to it</hi> honestly; all else is quite unimportant to him. This time fifty years, as I have often said to myself, the question will not be, Wert thou joyful or sorrowful? but, Wert thou true or wert thou false? Was thy little task faithfully done, or faithlessly? So we will move along; and fear no man, and no devil&#x2014;but the one <hi rend="italic">within</hi> us, which also we will to the last war with.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-201" n="06:201"/>I believe myself to be getting yearly by some hardly perceptible degree stronger in <hi rend="italic">health</hi>, both inward and outward: perhaps, one day, I may triumph over long disease, and be myself again! Still I know, healthy or sick, conquering or conquered, the Son of Adam has no blessedness to look for but <hi rend="italic">honest toil</hi> (which will never be <hi rend="italic">joyous</hi> but <hi rend="italic">grievous</hi>): let him toil at the thing <hi rend="italic">beside</hi> him, and bless Heaven that he has hands and a head!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have written more than I purposed; and time presses: it is nine o&#x2019;clock, and I have to be off in the morning about six (to breakfast with Skirving<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Skirving of Croys, Castle Douglas, Kirkcudbright. Carlyle writes in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> for <date when="1832-08-19">19 August</date>: &#x201C;Set off early in the morning of last Monday (the <date when="1832-08-13">13th</date>) to avoid the threatened inroad of &#x2018;Gunner bodies.&#x2019; Which inroad I do now find did actually take place. Breakfasted with Skirving at Croys: great talk from him about that foolish gift-of-tongues concern. &#x2026; Decayed triumphal arch at Castle Douglas in honour of the Reform Bill. Kirkcudbright all gay and sunny; the Churches beyond measure hospitable. Stay there till Thursday morning with little profit that I can find except a sight of Dundrennan Abbey. &#x2026; The Minister of that place, Jamie Thomson, familiar to me in a Debating Society at College, came out <hi rend="italic">white</hi>-whiskered, but brisk and sturdy; contrary to expectation knew me.&#x201D; For Skirving, see also <hi rend="italic">Two Reminiscences</hi>, pp. 125&#x2013;6, 131&#x2013;3, 136&#x2013;7.

Peter says, they should be <hi rend="italic">peeled:</hi> will you instruct the Boy about it, and tell him what sort of <hi rend="italic">tool</hi> to get, and where to get it: I suppose some old chisel or the like; but there is nothing of the sort here.&#x2014; I hope you have got the Bogs well cleared, and that we shall find you among innumerable <hi rend="italic">Corny Stooks</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sheaves rich with grain.</note> Is the House <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> about; is there anything to <hi rend="italic">be done</hi> in it?&#x2014; Tell our dear Mother that I will write to her, most probably <hi rend="italic">on Wednesday week:</hi> they can ask then at lea<supplied>[s</supplied>]t.

<p><salute>&#x2026;</salute> settling down on the whole party and threatened to end before night in permanent eclipse&#x2014; They <supplied>[two grouse hunters at Craigenputtoch]</supplied> had been told we &#x201C;could not quarter them&#x201D; the very maid being <hi rend="italic">going away</hi>, and the house to be locked up&#x2014; And however charming it might be &#x201C;to Shoot upon the moors&#x201D; doubtless they thought with Gillet<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> that &#x201C;to Sleep upon the moors&#x201D; would be less pleasant. Moreover Providence in its Mercy had wetted them with repeated thunder showers&#x2014;which I would have enjoyed with unmixed delight but for the recollection that these would also be wetting my husband<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Who was visiting the Church family.</note>&#x2014; And finally to fill the cup of disappointment to overflowing which gunners like other Mortals are doomed to <foreign>dree</foreign> [endure]&#x2014;not a grouse had been obliging enough to let itself be shot at! All these things were against them&#x2014;and highly consolatory to me while actually imprisoned in my own chamber&#x2014;the door locked&#x2014;afraid to stir from my chair for fear of my foot tread being heard&#x2014;and kept waiting an hour after my dinner time before any food could be administered to me. The idea of this lasting many days would have put me distracted&#x2014; I was already meditating <hi rend="italic">a walk</hi> in the evening in the disguise of a servant girl&#x2014; But the two having drank a bottle of whisky between them&#x2014;to say nothing of wine&#x2014;laid their judicious heads together and adopted the sudden and glorious resolution of evacuating a spot where Gods and Men and birds seemed all to have conspired against them&#x2014; Accordingly &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the light cart</hi>&#x201D; was yoked&#x2014;the clothes and provisions reladen&#x2014;and after many fruitless inquiries about the road to Knocksting<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Knocksting is a farm about 4 miles NW of Craigenputtoch.</note>&#x2014;the cavalcade set forth&#x2014; Robert the boy met them at Sandy Well<supplied>[s]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sandywells is 3 miles NE of Craigenputtoch.</note>&#x2014;from there questions about roads still uncertain, he thought, to what point of the compass to direct their flight. They told him it was such a place for <hi rend="italic">game</hi> as they never saw&#x2014; I suggested they should go <hi rend="italic">home</hi> and take a doze of physic and next day fall to some sort of work. Any way behold me&#x2014;happily delivered from this worse than the seven plagues of Egypt&#x2014;the plague of Gunners. Surely I am now secure for Betty is just setting out for Dumfries (where she seems <pb id="pg-06-203" n="06:203"/>to have left her heart&#x2014;a part of her head&#x2014;and all her temper), and so soon as she is gone I shall lock both doors and he will be a clever fellow that persuades me to open to him!</p>
<p>I send you a very worthless waistcoat which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C wonderful to say has pronounced <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, and advise you to wear it out (if you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> wear it) as fast as possible in case he comes upon us for it again in the winter. You know his passion for old clothes.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Give my love to Jenny and thanks for the cocks which <hi rend="italic">were</hi> the very best we have been privileged with this year. A kiss to the little curiosity&#x2014;I shall surely see it before long&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Alick would tell you, and the last Newspaper would tell you to expect a word from me tonight. I will tell you that I am well, that we are both well; and this is nearly my whole message. I have sat these two days; in the solitary moors, reading here (at a French Book, which is my task) from nine in the morning till ten at night, with hardly intermission for my meals and my pipes:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;Diderot.&#x201D;</note> so that my head is quite filled with foreign matters, and I could almost forget that beyond these Heaths there is a wide Earth, and I myself <hi rend="italic">am not out</hi> of the world, but still <hi rend="italic">in</hi> it. You will be thankful, I know, for any sort of stuff I can write you.</p>
<p>There is the last <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> with my Paper on the <hi rend="italic">Corn-Law Rhymes</hi> in it; which you are to read but not <hi rend="italic">detain;</hi> for the first sight of it properly belongs to Alick, and the Parcel was forgotten by accident when the Boy went down with the Horse. Let Alick have it, I pray you, by the first opportunity (along with that little Note); if you want to see more of it, he will send it back, and you can take pennyworths. The last Number of Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine is come to hand; you can return it along with the Review by Notman, when you are satisfied: other little things I might send in the Book way; but this, as I judge, is no reading time with you, but a time for plying sickles, and weary limbs.</p>
<p>My dear Mother, every time I hear that you are well, I hear it as an <hi rend="italic">unexpected</hi> blessing; and live in a continual kind of apprehension. Let the good Jean take pen again, and tell me all how the matter stands; what you are doing, how you are, and every one is. These foolish fears one should strive to banish; they are unprofitable, perhaps sinful: but a natural cowardice and faintheartedness is in one. I daresay, the truth is you are all reaping corn; and busy and moderately well: had one only a <hi rend="italic">glass</hi> to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> you all at work by, now and then! But it is needless wishing; one would be for a <hi rend="italic">trumpet</hi> next to <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> you by, and speak with you by.</p>
<p>I set off as Alick may have informed you on Monday morning gone <pb id="pg-06-205" n="06:205"/>a week, to be out of the road of Gunners and such like: the Gunners, as I found, actually came, and would have staid had I been there. However, I have now set about <hi rend="italic">letting</hi> the Game of the place, and so shall be troubled with it no more. For the rest, I had a pleasant sort of tour (among the Churches of Kirkchrist, Jeffrey of Girthon,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Duncan Church, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18180430-TC-JJ-01"><sic>1:126</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1818-04-30">30 April 1818</date></corr></ref>; for Robert Jeffrey, minister of Girthon, <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230808-TC-TM-01"><sic>2:411</sic><corr>TC to TM, <date when="1823-08-08">8 Aug. 1823</date></corr></ref>. Carlyle records in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> for <date when="1832-08-21">21 August</date>: &#x201C;Thursday morning to breakfast with Jeffrey of Girthon, whom I find older. &#x2026; Milroy, an old College figure, appears at breakfast (from Ballantrae, his Kirk, whence he has arrived the evening before).&#x201D; John Milroy (d. <date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>).</note> &#x26;c); and returned on thursday evening no worse for my excursion. People were all very kind; the country was all beautiful to behold; I saw various persons familiar to me <hi rend="italic">very</hi> long ago (at College and elsewhere), whose whiskers were now getting grey, whom I could not look upon without interest. I will <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> you about it all when we meet: I passed Lochinbreck Well<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Loch, inn, and spa in Kirkcudbrightshire, 4 miles SW of New Galloway. Carlyle continues in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> that Milroy &#x201C;rides with me to Lauriston, past Lochinbreck Well, where we drink a tumbler of the water, and a night (nine years bygone) comes vividly to my mind. At the end of the Lauriston hamlet, the Minister meets his father: I now have no father to meet. Home &#x2026; about six o&#x2019;clock. Wife with her green veil, who has seen me on the hillside, meets me at the gate.&#x201D;</note> too, and drank a tumbler of their arsenic water: finally I was very glad to see the Wife running out to meet me, in her green veil (for midges), and welcome me to my own solitude again.</p>
<p>Nothing has happened here but one thing which will surprise you: the total and peremptory dismissal for ever and a day of our servant Betty, on Saturday last! Her tricks were found out before that, and her scandalous <hi rend="italic">situation:</hi> so nothing was said; but on Friday, the day after my return, we took <hi rend="italic">Clatch</hi> to Thornhill, engaged a new servant (by Mrs Glendinning&#x2019;s help), returned that night; and next morning, without noise of any kind, or more words than some half dozen quite deliberate ones, sent the wretched <hi rend="italic">Adulteress</hi> (for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the way <hi rend="italic">now</hi>) about her business bag and baggage. The new woman (a glasseyed, <foreign><hi rend="italic">leish</hi>-looking <hi rend="italic">haveril</hi></foreign> [active-looking, half-witted] sort of character) does not come till tomorrow: so Jane and the Boy have been busy enough.&#x2014; O Mother! Mother! what trouble the Devil does give us; how <hi rend="italic">busy he</hi> is wheresoever men are! I could not have fancied this unhappy shameless heartless creature would have proved herself so: but she was long known for a person that did not <hi rend="italic">speak the truth</hi>, and of such (as I have often remarked) there <hi rend="italic">never</hi> comes good. God pity her! It would not surprise me much if <hi rend="italic">this</hi> were not the worst <pb id="pg-06-206" n="06:206"/>she would do yet, if she live. May I never hear of her more: that is my best prayer for her.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This paragraph was omitted by Norton. Betty Smail was the daughter of a mother of the same name (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280800-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>4:394&#x2013;95</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1828-08-23">23 Aug. 1828</date></corr></ref>). Her pregnancy (not necessarily adultery) was with &#x201C;Wilson the Poacher&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321112-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1832-11-12">12 Nov.</date></ref>). Carlyle&#x2019;s entry under <date when="1832-08-21">21 August</date> in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> was more cryptic: &#x201C;the Devil has been among our household here; a much-favoured creature, long with us, proves to be sinking Hellward.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Except two little trifles for Fraser, not printed yet, I have done as good as nothing since I saw you! I have not been idle either; but some how it has <foreign><hi rend="italic">kithed</hi></foreign> ill [come to little]. I have now begun a long thing (on a Frenchman called <hi rend="italic">Diderot</hi>), and must not stir, if I can help it, till it be done. Alas! I have still upwards of 20 large volumes (1 per day) to <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, before I can put pen to paper! However, it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be done; and so shall be done, if I keep my health<supplied>[.]</supplied> You will hear from me again before that: nay if it threaten to detain me <hi rend="italic">too</hi> long, I will run and leave it for three days after all. If I go to Edinburgh in winter, both <hi rend="italic">this</hi> and another long piece ought to be done first: I must struggle what I can. Jeffrey is not paid yet; but can now be paid any day, and leave me a handsome enough sum over.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320731-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-07-31">31 July</date></ref>.</note> Napier I believe owes me more. I am in debt to no Being,&#x2014;but to you, and the <hi rend="small-caps">Great</hi> Lender and Giver; to the rest I pay as well as borrow: what more would I have?</p>
<p>The Paper on Goethe, I see, is published in London last week; it will be here before very long; after which I will send Scotsbrig a reading of it. I reckon it but little worth, either at Scotsbrig or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Jane has been very considerably better during these two last weeks; but the journey on Friday and back again among the rain did not suit her so well, and her throat seems to be a little sorish. She imputes much of her improvement to drinking <hi rend="italic">Bitters;</hi> and among these, she gives the praise beyond all others to one called <hi rend="italic">Trefoil</hi> (&#x201C;Threefold&#x201D;), which accordingly she has been diligent in consuming, and recommends to all people. I sometimes take a glass of it in the morning; the taste is bad, the effect rather good. This invaluable &#x201C;Threefold&#x201D; grows in our bogs here, and the Boy has been gathering a harvest of it, but has not yet got enough. Shall we send you a little parcel of it to try?&#x2014; But, alas, both paper and time are done; for I have much to write yet, and here is tea! I will write again before long: did I write <hi rend="italic">everything</hi> I have to say, whole reams of paper would not suffice.&#x2014; Take care of yourself, my dear Mother: your continuance here is <pb id="pg-06-207" n="06:207"/>among our chosen blessings; to know you in some degree of health and comfort is the news that of all others gratifies me. Take care of yourself for the sake of us all.</p>
<p>I still read in the Bible. Did you ever hear of <hi rend="italic">John Welsh&#x2019;s</hi> Sermon&#x2019;s? It is the brave old John Welsh of Colliston, son in law to Knox. I saw the Book at Jeffreys of Girthon, who said they were among the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> sermons he had ever read. I think, for the sake of <hi rend="italic">relationship</hi> and ancestry, we should seek them out: in Edinburgh I will make a trial; and perhaps find some far earlier and better copy than Jeffrey&#x2019;s.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310824-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-24">24 Aug. 1831</date></ref>. John Welsh (<date when="1568-00-00">1568</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1622-00-00">1622</date>), minister at Ayr, author of <hi rend="italic">Forty-eight Select Sermons</hi> (Glasgow, <date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>), was the son-in-law of John Knox. Jane Carlyle&#x2019;s relation to him may be doubtful (see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251128-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:420</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-11-28">28 Nov. 1825</date></corr></ref> and <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 133&#x2013;34).</note></p>
<p>But, at length, dear Mother, good night! Bid Jean write, write with minuteness and despatch. I asked about her getting hither: but, alas, I suppose it is over now till after Harvest; we will see to it then. My Brotherly love to Jamie and Jenny and all the rest of them. Tell them all to be good and true; there is <hi rend="italic">no other</hi> benefit a man with all his cunning can extract from Life. Life is short, Eternity is long! Wise and good was he who commanded saying &#x201C;Little children love one another.&#x201D;&#x2014; <closer><salute>Good night my dear Mother; may God ever be with you!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I shall by and by need money; and will draw upon you for the amount of these two Contributions so soon as you instruct me how. To you probably for such a matter all days are alike: in any case, pray do not hurry or incommode yourself; the necessity is nowise of the instant sort; not come properly, but coming.</p>
<p>The Review, by some mysterious conveyance, reached me safe at last, and failed not of its welcome. Macaulay is always spirited and emphatic, worth reading even on a worn out matter; Macculloch too tells a substantial story in his own stubborn way: I farther praised that lively critic of Trollope and her Americans; a clever right feeling man, whose hand I know, whose name (if it is not a secret) you will <pb id="pg-06-208" n="06:208"/>perhaps tell me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to the following articles in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, LV (<date when="1832-07-00">July 1832</date>): T. B. Macaulay, &#x201C;Dumont&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Recollections of Mirabeau</hi>&#x2014;The French Revolution,&#x201D; 552&#x2013;76; J. R. McCulloch, &#x201C;Recent Commercial Policy of Britain,&#x201D; 421&#x2013;37; William Empson, &#x201C;The Americans and Their Detractors,&#x201D; 479&#x2013;526, a review of Mrs. Trollope&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Domestic Manners</hi> and three other works.</note> On the whole, this seems a superior Number. As to my poor Paper,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Corn-Law Rhymes.&#x201D;</note> it was most handsomely printed; only that the separate <hi rend="italic">Copies</hi> for myself were forgotten: if you could still be so kind as tell the Bookseller to forward them (to forward <hi rend="italic">one</hi> at all rates) it would be in time.</p>
<p>Another request I have, connected with the Library. <hi rend="italic">Casanova</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cagliostro</hi> may lie over: but perhaps you could without much trouble send me the following three Books: Nichols&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Anecdotes</hi> (of Literature, or Literary Men, I forget which); <hi rend="italic">Menagiana</hi>, and Selden&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Table Talk</hi>?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Nichols (<date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>), <hi rend="italic">Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century</hi>, 9 vols.

Since the time when D&#x2019;Ercilla wrote his Epic Poem on <hi rend="italic">leather</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alonso de Ercilla y Z&#xFA;&#xf1;iga (<date when="1533-00-00">1533</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1596-00-00">96</date>?), Spanish poet and soldier praised by Cervantes, author of the epic poem <hi rend="italic">La Araucana</hi> (<date when="1569-00-00">1569</date>&#x2013;<date when="1590-00-00">90</date>).</note> there have few writing men been so miserably off for Books as I. <foreign><hi rend="italic">C&#x2019;est &#xE0; se d&#xE9;sesp&#xE9;rer</hi></foreign> [It makes one despair], as the French say. But, again, say the same authorities: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Il faut se ranger</hi></foreign> [It is necessary to acquiesce].</p>
<p>I have another Essay on my mind; and have had for a twelvemonth: but will not touch upon it, in such a state of bustle as I am in at present.

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>I have waited several weeks for franks, for your return out of Cornwall, for leisure to write in; and will now wait no longer, but write without leisure, or any other furtherance; considering, as I might have done from the first, that a few copper Pence will carry this sheet to you in any quarter of the British dominions, and the mere superscription and signature will find it welcome. Nay probably enough you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> returned, and sitting quietly at work in the India House; wondering a little, I hope, now and then whether the Postman will bring you no news of me.</p>
<p>Your Letters are honest genuine Letters, and always give me great pleasure. I prize much the feeling you entertain towards me; which indeed is of the sort the most precious, for both parties, that man can bear for man. In your critical estimate of me I can easily enough foresee that a few years will produce a wonderful reduction, and your &#x201C;Artist&#x201D; will stand forth in his true dimensions, an honest Artisan: but even this in these days is something; and always it will be flattering and encouraging that a man of your clearness and cool deliberateness could so exaggerate me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written in his letter of <date when="1832-07-17">17 July</date>: &#x201C;You also call me one of your teachers; but if I am this, it is as yet only in the sense in which a schoolmaster might speak of his teachers, meaning those who teach under him. I certainly could not now write, and perhaps shall never be able to write, any thing from which any person can derive so much edification as I, and several others, have derived in particular from your paper on Johnson. My vocation, as far as I yet see, lies in a humbler sphere; I am rather fitted to be a logical expounder than an artist. You I look upon as an artist, and perhaps the only genuine one now living in this country: the highest destiny of all, lies in that direction; for it is the artist alone in whose hands Truth becomes impressive, and a living principle of action. Yet it is something not inconsiderable, (in an age in which the understanding is more cultivated and developed than any of the other faculties, &#x26; is the only faculty which men do not habitually distrust) if one could address them through the understanding, &#x26; ostensibly with little besides mere logical apparatus, yet in a spirit higher than was ever inspired by mere logic, and in such sort that their understandings shall at least learn to be <hi rend="italic">reconciled</hi> to those truths, which even then will not be <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> until they shall have been breathed upon by the breath of the artist. For, as far as I have observed, the majority even of those who are capable of receiving Truth into their minds, must have the logical side of it turned <hi rend="italic">first</hi> towards them; then it must be quite turned round before them, that they may see it to be the same Truth in its poetic that it is in its metaphysical aspect. Now this is what I seem to myself qualified for, if for anything; or at least, capable of qualifying myself for; and it is thus that I may be, and therefore ought to be, not useless as an auxiliary even to you, though I am sensible that I can never give back to you the value of what I receive from you.&#x201D;</note> Neither, after all, does our <pb id="pg-06-210" n="06:210"/>relation depend on that; nor need any length of years diminish or disturb it; for it rests on a true basis, and is a relation between two Somethings, and not between two Nothings,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">ratio</hi> or quotient of <hi rend="italic">which</hi>, as you doubtless know, is quite indefinite and imaginary, and fluctuates between infinitude and zero.&#x2014; Meanwhile, be that as it may, I am to reiterate my request for Letters; wherein too, pray understand, I am not singular but plural, at least <hi rend="italic">dual</hi>, the Lady also joining in it, with whom you have the honour to be a first-rate favourite. I will beg you also nowise to forget the <hi rend="italic">historical</hi> department, that of Biography, above all of Autobiography. Remember that we here, in the wilderness, far from being afflicted with excess of News, are in a starving state for want of them; the smallest authentic contribution is valuable. Were you to tell me only that you had met such a one at such a time walking in the Strand &#x2018;with his hat upon his head,&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle adapts or misquotes Johnson&#x2019;s parody of Percy&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Hermit:</hi> &#x201C;I put my hat upon my head / And walk&#x2019;d into the Strand, / And there I met another man / Who&#x2019;s hat was in his hand.&#x201D; See Johnson, <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>, ed. E. L. McAdam, Jr., with G. Milne (New Haven, <date when="1964-00-00">1964</date>), p. 269.</note> you have no notion what I could make of it in the moors! All mortals one has known are interesting; doubly and trebly so those one loves: fancy that I can here know nothing of any one, and would so gladly know all.</p>
<p>We have sometimes been reflecting of late on the <hi rend="italic">impossibility</hi> of your spending this Vacation with us: &#x2018;not only so much that was impossible but so much that was possible is denied one&#x2019;! However, we take it for settled, unless something special intervene, that the next turn is to be ours; and these lone wilds are to hear your voice and mine. We will show you a new phasis of life; which, as it too lies under the heavenly Vault, may be worth looking at, till you have understood it. Perhaps there is no Philosopher in the Earth that now leads so wonderful an existence as mine. Whinstone mountains, peat-bog; bare wolds alternating with primeval crags and the shade of leafy trees; peopled with Galloway oxen, grouse and blackfaced sheep, and here and there a brown-faced herdsman: this is my environment. Uttermost solitude; except my &#x2018;Life-companion&#x2019; no human soul with which to commune: sometimes there are weeks in which one does not speak a word to any other mortal. I have a long Terrace, of two miles <pb id="pg-06-211" n="06:211"/>or more, called the road of the &#x2018;Glaisters Hill-side,&#x2019; where I walk, and look away into Ayrshire, and over the granite of Galloway; a grim scene, where your Thought is interrupted by hardly any living object, and stretches almost of itself into the regions of Eternity; for Desolation, Solitude, is the most eternal of things; left so to himself Man is a kind of preternatural being, and in a Patmos may well write an Apocalypse. Were I of the spasmodic School,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently a Carlylean coinage, later to be used by W. E. Aytoun (<date when="1854-05-00">May 1854</date>) of the so-called &#x201C;spasmodic school&#x201D; of poets.</note> I could gnash my teeth, now and then, over such a banishment: but my creed lies not that way; I reflect rather what deluges of Folly and Falsehood I stand safe from; in any case, that here also is a Heaven above me, and the first and last blessedness of man: honest work to toil at. So I work with great fury, ride with great fury for exercise, smoke with great fury for amusement; and ever and anon, when I have finished some little thing, dash down for two days into the low country, and see friends; can still see a Mother and true Brothers, my brave Father I can now no longer see. On the whole, it is a tolerable life; and I thank God for it; and pray only that I may transact it wisely; and all else wisely that his Decrees may have allotted me. It is only in Idleness that I am unhappy, am contemptible; and then I deserve to be so.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night come our Papers and our Letters. What a night! You should hear our little Messenger<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert M&#x2019;Whir, the servant boy, who has been to Dumfries for the weekly market day.</note> come trotting in, with groceries, and philosophies, and political revolutions and friendly vows, all packed promiscuously together in his holsters; and how one starts to think what a week may have brought forth. The Manuscript once despatched, our first clutch is at the <hi rend="italic">Examiner;</hi> and we see Fonblanque and you warning mankind of the wrath to come.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to Mineka (XII, 112 n.), two articles by Mill entitled &#x201C;Pledges&#x201D; which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> for <date when="1832-07-01">1</date> and <date when="1832-07-15">15 July</date>, pp. 417&#x2013;18, 449&#x2013;51, were confessed by Mill years later to have been ill-timed and to have cost the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> 200 subscribers.</note> Here, however, I must mention, that our London Correspondent from time to time disappoints us (as for example, last week), and there is no <hi rend="italic">Examiner;</hi> a most melancholy case! For which reason I have long purposed stating it to you, and asking whether there was no help. You must understand, our Post-night answers to the Monday of London; so that a secondhand <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> is perfectly as good for us as a new one. But then the unpunctuality of men! And one omission destroys one&#x2019;s confidence for many weeks. The question therefore is: Have you <pb id="pg-06-212" n="06:212"/>(whom I believe to be like myself as punctual as clockwork) an Ex<hi rend="italic">r</hi> that you can part with for Monday&#x2019;s post, or do you know how such were procurable? I should like it of all things from <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> the writing on the cover is so interesting for its own sake. Tell me if you can do anything. If not, I believe I must order a first-hand Paper, and let it lie wasting its sweetness for two whole days in the desert Postbag.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gray&#x2019;s &#x201C;Elegy,&#x201D; l. 56.</note></p>
<p>Did you get your Books? They were sent off, as I announced; they may be forgotten at Longman&#x2019;s, at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>: tell me, and I will stir again. You offer to lend me books; and God knows I have much need of books. I accept you, therefore; send me any new thing you can spare and think interesting; for example, Dumont&#x2019;s Mirabeau, Babbage&#x2019;s two Books;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pierre Etienne Louis Dumont (<date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>), Swiss publicist and associate of Mirabeau; author of <hi rend="italic">Souvenirs sur Mirabeau</hi> (<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>); Charles Babbage (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>), English mathematician, author of <hi rend="italic">Reflections on the Decline of Science in England</hi> (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), <hi rend="italic">On the Economy of Machines and Manufactures</hi> (<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), and other books (some of which were published by <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>). See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311021-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-10-21">21 Oct. 1831</date></ref>.</note> conceive that I see in general <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> but some Reviews and Magazines, and have the truest pleasure <supplied>[in]</supplied> whatsoever throws light on any human thing. Nay you may have old books that are new to me; could you give me some outline of your stock? I command the Edinburgh Libraries when I exert myself: but I have no right agent there; and often before the Book come my reading time is over. For the rest, this is your method of despatch: Address to me here &#x201C;care of Messrs M&#x2019;Kinnel &#x26; M&#x2019;Kie Booksellers Dumfries,&#x201D; and leave it with Fraser, 215 Regent-Street, it will come up (once I have explained it to him) fast and cheap with his Magazines. I know another way, if this will not answer. Pray try it soon; and send a long Letter at all events. If you have not got that <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi>, that <hi rend="italic">Babbage</hi>, do not in the smallest mind them.</p>
<p>Alas, the sheet is done, and I am hardly beginning. Tell Buller to get into a reformed Parliament that one may have a frank now and then, and some elbow-room for writing.&#x2014; I procured Tait&#x2019;s second Number, and read your Essay,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Use and Abuse of Political Terms,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi>, I (<date when="1832-05-00">May 1832</date>), 164&#x2013;72.</note> and found it <hi rend="italic">true:</hi> all the rest was very barren and unfruitful; I have seen nothing more of it. Six Numbers of Bulwer<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bulwer&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi>.</note> I got also: well-meaning, but narrow, narrow; not the <hi rend="italic">web</hi> at all, only the mere (political) <hi rend="italic">listing</hi>. I have too become acquainted with a new phasis of mind; what I could call Oxford Liberalism. Fonblanque is the only clever man among them; a man whom one <pb id="pg-06-213" n="06:213"/>grudges to see a mere Radical, and thereby obliged to turn all his fine spirit into contemptuous bitterness. I saw Buller too; and endured another dose of poor Puckler<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Buller, &#x201C;Tour of a German Prince,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi>, XVI (<date when="1832-01-00">Jan. 1832</date>), 225&#x2013;43, about Hermann Ludwig Heinrich P&#xfc;ckler-Muskau (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>).</note> for his sake. Two years or three ago, I remember, &#x201C;Bishop Heber&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reginald Heber (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>), bishop and liberal theologian. Carlyle is referring to reviews and discussions of his works, as that by Jeffrey in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, XLVIII (<date when="1828-12-00">December 1828</date>), 312&#x2013;35.</note> was almost equally distressing: for what you understand once, you would fain not be taught an hundred times. Heber, however, passed away, and there was silence; as again there will be. Buller&#x2019;s Paper is the only reasonable one I have seen on the business. And guess what I am now reading. <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres de Diderot:</hi> 25 octavos, at the rate of one a-day; whereof you will hear somewhat by and by. <closer><salute>For the present it is over.&#x2014; Write soon. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Vale mei memor</hi></foreign> [Farewell remember me]!&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>
<ps><p>Do you still see Glen? My Brother often asks about him, and I can say nothing. Be patient be kind towards Glen: he may be worth it one day. Did he not <hi rend="italic">write</hi> something about Fanny Kemble? I said: <foreign>Aut Glennus aut Diabolus</foreign> [Either Glen or the Devil].<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle plays on &#x201C;Aut Caesar, aut nullus.&#x201D; Mill replied in his letter of <date when="1832-09-17">17 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;He did <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, it seems, write anything about Fanny Kemble. The paper therefore to which you allude must be the work of <hi rend="italic">Diabolus</hi>. I think he (Glennus, not Diabolus) seemed less uneasy in mind than formerly; this might be accidental: in other respects he is much the same&#x201D; (Mineka, XII, 119). The article on Fanny Kemble, &#x201C;Miss Fanny Kemble&#x2019;s &#x2018;Francis the First,&#x2019; and Mr. Sheridan Knowles&#x2019;s &#x2018;Hunchback,&#x2019;&#x201D; which treats her favorably, was in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, V (<date when="1832-05-00">May 1832</date>), 432&#x2013;47.</note> It is like the first staggering walk, of a Steer that will one day draw waggons; as yet all zigzag, splayfooted and heteroclite. William Fraser, I fear, will go over to the Dandies: I shall mourn for him; there was worth in him: let us still hope. And now once more (with new wishes from both of us) Farewell! <name>T. C.</name></p>
<p>Remember me in all affection to Mrs Austin, who I hope is busy and well, and see her husband so too. To my dear Bullers also&#x2014; I have nothing new that I think of at Press; you have it all out, and I am done with it. Corn-Law unaltered, untouched: there is Life in Macvey!</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I wrote you a little word this night week; not thinking I should have a call to write you another so soon. Our luck is better than we expected. Jack&#x2019;s Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated at Naples, <date when="1832-07-31">31 July</date>.</note> comes last Wednesday, and the Review article too; of both which you must forthwith have a look.</p>
<p>Jack is well, and all is well with him. I had some thoughts of writing him today; but put it off till next week: an unanswered Letter of mine is still on the way to him, or has arrived lately.</p>
<p>The foreign Quarterly Review paper<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The number for <date when="1832-08-00">August</date>, containing &#x201C;Goethe&#x2019;s Works.&#x201D;</note> is for Alick, his Edinburgh one<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> for <date when="1832-07-00">July</date>, with &#x201C;Corn-Law Rhymes.&#x201D;</note> having failed: you will take a look at it as it passes, and see whether I have made it &#x201C;too high.&#x201D; There is not so much <hi rend="italic">hurry</hi> about this: Alick does not expect this so soon, perhaps does not expect it at all. I was very sorry to disappoint him on his Paper last week, and you of your <hi rend="italic">Examiner;</hi> but what could I do? This week, I hope, will prove luckier; farther, I am just writing to John Mill to see whether he can set me on some better train in the Newspaper way; and Mill is a very punctual man.</p>
<p>Our new servant woman is deafish, but not <foreign><hi rend="italic">donnert</hi></foreign> [stupid]; and <foreign><hi rend="italic">waal</hi></foreign> [agile] as an eel. She has good skill too, and does perfectly well. The poor Boy (whom his old Neighbour<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Smail.</note> was forcing and leading to Deception and Devilry) looks like a fish restored to water, ever since &#x2018;the Revolution&#x2019;: all takes its old course again, as well as ever.</p>
<p>For myself I have stuck like a <hi rend="italic">burr</hi> to my reading, and managed a volume every lawful day. On Sabbath I read to my assembled household, in the Book of Genesis. Today I have been writing mostly Letters; in which I have come poor speed. This Task must and shall be done: then I will see you, and be glad a little. My health, notwithstanding Jack&#x2019;s apprehensions, continues as it was, or even improves.&#x2014; Jane has had a dirty sneaking cold all this week; but it is now nearly gone. She has improved very greatly since you saw her; drinks <hi rend="italic">trefoil</hi>, <pb id="pg-06-215" n="06:215"/>and rides. We have got no <hi rend="italic">news</hi> from any side I think, since I wrote.</p>
<p>The weather I am afraid is not good for Scotsbrig and Jamie; here we have it very cold and drizzly and disagreeable; and the fields fast whitening: however, we must all keep up our hearts. There are weeks of sunshine yet waiting us.&#x2014; Alick wrote last Wednesday that you were all in your usual way: tell my worthy Jean that it has become absolutely necessary for her to take up the pen, and write more definitely. I am never wholly free from anxieties about you: and yet it is wrong to grieve oneself, and good to hope rather than fear. I beg of you again and again, dear Mother, to take care of yourself; and I entreat every one of them (personally) to take care of you. Our mercies, as Jack says, are indeed manifold: let us prize them, and enjoy them.&#x2014; The dark rushes down all at once, and the Boy must off to M&#x2019;Knight&#x2019;s. My love to every one of you. God keep you all!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever (my dear Mother) your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We received your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1832-07-31">31 July</date>.</note> on the 22<hi rend="italic">nd;</hi> with great satisfaction to learn that you were still well. I write now to be sure of anticipating your departure from Naples; this will probably be my last Letter you will get there. It seems to me also, if you were once settled at Rome, it will be better to give up this <hi rend="italic">overlapping</hi> method of Correspondence; and, at the cost of hearing from each other somewhat less frequently, take the common plan of Letter and Answer: there is a certain confused perplexity of thought inseparable from our present practice; and as the Post seems now to do its duty pretty well, if we insist on answering the <hi rend="italic">very day</hi> we hear, there may still be a Letter once in the five weeks; which till better times we should put up with. I will follow the directions of your <hi rend="italic">next</hi> Letter, whatever they may be, if possible: but I warn you now to make ready for the new arrangement. Your Letters I see are all opened and re-sealed before they arrive: but it makes little difference, since such is the will of the Potentates, poor <pb id="pg-06-216" n="06:216"/>fellows; we have no Carbonari secrets to treat of; and are quite willing to let any biped or quadruped reign in Italy or out of it so long as he can. Write in your <hi rend="italic">smallest</hi> hand, and be very biographical. The last Letter is on to Scotsbrig; and they are reading it perhaps this day.</p>
<p>All is well here, in its old course. My Article-works are all published and away from me; the <hi rend="italic">Goethe,</hi> which was the last of them, went off in a printed shape to Catlinns on Wednesday. A certain &#x201C;De Romanis&#x201D; is said to sell the F. Q. Review at Rome; but I suppose you will find him <hi rend="italic">blank:</hi> the thing can wait; it is a poor fragmentary thing; some of it was put into Teufelsdreck&#x2019;s mouth, and I had a letter from London since asking <hi rend="italic">where</hi> Teufelsdreck&#x2019;s great work (<hi rend="italic">Die Kleider</hi>) [<hi rend="italic">The Clothes</hi>] was to be fallen in with!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently Carlyle refers to the following letter, dated <date when="1832-08-17">17 August</date>, from one Adolphus Bernays, whom he had met in London: &#x201C;You left us rather suddenly, &#x26; I regret you did not give me an opportunity to shake hands with you before your departure; but I suppose amidst the many old &#x26; important friends &#x26; acquaintances you must have in London, one so recent &#x26; unimportant was easily forgotten. I have however, I can assure you, been in frequent mental communion with you, &#x26; have been particularly pleased with your last article in the For. Quart. [&#x201C;Goethe&#x2019;s Works&#x201D;]. It is indeed this article which has induced me to intrude upon you for the purpose of asking you, who der Teufel is Teufelsdreck, &#x26; where you have <foreign>aufgegabelt</foreign> [seized upon] this odd book of his? Does it exist in reality &#x26; is it to be had, or is it a mere fiction of yours, a peg to hang your own genial ideas on? Pray vouchsafe me an answer to these queries. Hoping both you &#x26; Mrs C. are better in health, &#x26; with respects to the fair lady, I remain. &#x2026;&#x201D; No reply by Carlyle to this letter has been found.</note> Did I say that the <hi rend="italic">Corn Law Rhymes</hi> was printed without the slightest mutilation? So far well: I have now written to Napier to pay me for it, and with the proceeds mean forthwith to clear scores with the Advocate, and sign myself <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nemini debens</hi></foreign> [indebted to no one]. This is one fruit <supplied>[which]</supplied> springs from my Labours, and why should I calculate on any other? There are two little Translations of mine off to Fraser; the <hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen</hi> with a commentary; a shorter Piece named <hi rend="italic">Novelle:</hi> F. is very complaisant with me; whether he accept or reject these trifles is left with himself. I am a little curious to know what that Florence Parcelkin is; probably <hi rend="italic">Johnson&#x2019;s Biography:</hi> I have sent Fraser a hint about his <hi rend="italic">misfortunes,</hi> and mean to say more by and by. My next task is a very tedious one, an essay on <hi rend="italic">Diderot,</hi> as a preliminary for which I have 25 octavo volumes to read, and only some 8 of them done yet: it will serve me till the end of <date when="1832-09-00">September</date>, and be worth next to nothing when done. I have engaged for it, and must accomplish it. For the rest, be under no fear lest I overwork myself. Alas, quite the other danger is to be dreaded. I do not neglect walking, riding (as for instance this morning); besides the air here is quite specially bracing <pb id="pg-06-217" n="06:217"/>and good; I have had a kind of fixed persuasion of late that I was one day to get quite well again, or nearly so; some day, that is, between this and the Greek Calends. Indeed, on the whole, I am full of a sentiment which I name &#x201C;desperate hope,&#x201D; and have long been getting fuller: we shall see what will come of it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the state of mind revealed in the entry for <date when="1832-08-11">11 August</date> (actually <date when="1832-08-10">10 August</date>) in Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> in Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle,</hi> II, 308.</note> Meanwhile, in my Imprisonment here whether for Life or not, I have bethought me that I ought to get infinitely more <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> than I have now means of; and <hi rend="italic">will</hi> get it, one way or other, tho&#x2019; the Dumfries Libraries I have been prying into the rules and state of as yet yield nothing.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> entry in Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle,</hi> II, 281. In a <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> entry under the date <date when="1832-07-21">21 July</date> Carlyle devoted a page and a half to the want of public libraries in Britain. He thought them &#x201C;crypts&#x201D; and not lending libraries, complained of the nonexistence of catalogues, and advocated that &#x201C;120 millions of money&#x201D; be allocated to set up good public libraries in every country&#x2014;a sum he guessed had been spent every day in the &#x201C;late French war.&#x201D; Carlyle was later to play an important role in the founding of the London Library.</note> A very large mass of Magazines, Reviews, and such like I have consumed, like smoke, within the last month: gaining, I think, <hi rend="italic">no</hi> knowledge, except of the no-knowledge of the writing world. Books produce a strange effect on me here, I swallow them with such unpausing impetuosity, from early morning to late night, and get altogether filled and intoxicated with them. A little talk were wholesome dissipation for me: but it is not to be had; and one can do without it.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Carlyle&#x2019;s entry in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> under <date when="1832-09-03">3 September</date> in Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle,</hi> II, 309.</note> My Janekin, if no great speaker, is the best of listeners; and what she does say is in general real speech and not chatter.</p>
<p>On Monday the <date when="1832-08-13">13<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of this month</date>, apprehending, with reason, an inroad of Grouse-killers I fled about six in the morning (as it had been previously arranged) into Galloway. I breakfasted with Skirving of Croys, rode thro&#x2019; Castle-Douglas with its withered &#x201C;Reform-jubilee&#x201D; Triumphal Arch (most villages have had such); and about two o&#x2019;clock was in the parlour of Kirkchrist. The Churches were in high spirits to see me; I remembered with a kind of shudder that it was <hi rend="italic">nine years</hi> since you and I went thither on my last previous visit. The old people are hardly changed; look healthy and prosperous; all was trim about them, flourishing crops, and the hope of Harvest just about to begin realizing itself. Great change in the younger parties: two female infants become rather interesting young ladies; John, whom I remembered in bib and tucker shot up to six feet and more, a talking, prompt rather promising young man, intended for the factor line. <pb id="pg-06-218" n="06:218"/>I could not but reflect, as I have done more than once of late, how small a proportion of mere <hi rend="italic">intellect</hi> will serve a man&#x2019;s turn, if all the rest be right: John Church, as I said, promises well; James, at Calcutta, is doing admirably well; and their heads are both of the smallest. Many kind inquiries from all sides were made for you, and kind remembrances sent: Church was full of Herculaneum, and will question you strictly when he gets you. His old Father departed last winter; mildly, and full of years. Isaac Davidson is home from India in poor health and not content with his lot: I did not see him, he was in Edinburgh. Poor Donaldson the Schoolmaster, my old comrade in Kirkcaldy, has had to put away his wife for the sin of drunkenness, and was a saddish kind of sight to me. I called on old Gordon (John&#x2019;s father); terrified him much, but found him a very worthy and sensible man. Finally on thursday morning I departed for Girthon; breakfasted with Jeffrey (whom I found turned into a Radical), and by rough ways and over deep rivers reached home that evening about six.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Donaldson, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18180902-TC-JCE-01"><sic>1:140</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1818-09-02">2 Sept. 1818</date></corr></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences,</hi> II, 32; Jeffrey is Robert Jeffrey of Girthon.</note> Galloway was beautiful, all green and orange, under the clear mellow sky: I had glanced into a peopled country, seen old friends, and not wholly wasted my time. Jeffrey, I must add too, was special in his inquiries about your welfare; your situation he had already ascertained (from &#x201C;Blind Robie&#x201D; the Fiddler, if from no other): he expressed great gratitude for your help of him in German, wherein he was again stuck fast for want of Books; I agreed to supply him in that matter, and we were to institute a regular <hi rend="italic">exchange</hi> of Books by our Carriers, he to begin, which however he has not yet done. So endeth this episode.</p>
<p>From Annandale I hear good news and nothing else three days ago. They are all well; our Mother &#x201C;rather better than usual&#x201D;; Jamie had begun his harvest (the crops excellent, the weather rather damp)<supplied>[.]</supplied> Alick&#x2019;s house had been unroofed (just at the wrong time, for wet); but by his arrangements the slate would <hi rend="italic">soon</hi> be on, and all rain-<hi rend="italic">drops</hi> defied for the future. I have heard from himself several times since I wrote to you: he gets the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> Newspaper from us weekly, our Mother the <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> of which she is exceedingly fond. In respect of this latter, your punctuality is now and then desiderated: Tom Holcroft, who sends it us, misses about one in the month; and I suppose cannot help it. I have just written to Mill inquiring whether he can form no other arrangement for us. Holcroft has never written, and I hear not a word about him or Badams or any one <foreign><hi rend="italic">von diesem <pb id="pg-06-219" n="06:219"/>Geschlechte</hi></foreign> [of this group]. Badams&#x2019;s address even is not rightly known to me. Neither has the &#x201C;noble lady&#x201D; ever written; tho&#x2019; she was written to months ago: perhaps I should rather honour her for this omission or forbearance; Jane and I had evidently become hateful to all that diabolic household, and on our own side quite satisfied not to say sated of it; nevertheless the noble lady, quick as a lynx to see this, stood by us faithfully and acted with friendliest regard and even reverence to the very last. Now perhaps, she thinks such effort superfluous, and so do we: her feeling we know is kindly, and <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be translated into no action of importance. Poor old Montague seemed wearied out and failing; Badams used to say he would not last long. Procter is an innocent kind of body; but not undeserving the name our little lady here used to give him: &#x201C;that <hi rend="italic">Dud</hi>.&#x201D; A more entire <hi rend="italic">Dud</hi> it would perhaps be difficult to find in the Poetical or Periodical world. Mrs P. is honest, keen shallow and waspish: God mend them and us! We can do them &#x201C;neither ill na&#x2019; good.&#x201D;&#x2014; My British news are now nearly written: I need not trouble you with Reform-bill rejoicings and then, alas, with the electioneerings: it is here that the Reform-bill comes to the test: set the Angel Gabriel to <hi rend="italic">elect</hi> a Parliament, how shall he succeed when there is none to elect!

The election was in <date when="1832-12-00">Dec.</date>, when Malcolm withdrew, and the successful candidate was Sharpe, who had been nominated by the provost of Dumfries and John M&#x2019;Diarmid.</note> However, a new generation will arise, and then. The Advoca<supplied>[te]</supplied> I find is at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> canvassing, and will succeed, tho&#x2019; the whole country (that had much hope in him) have been disappointed. They say, he will be made a Judge when any vacancy occurs, and be set free of Politics: it were a happy change.&#x2014; Of Glen we hear nothing, and reckon it creditable that he does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> write: I fancied I saw in Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine a thing of his on Miss Fanny Kemble; full of sound and fury, not without a kind of aimless strength. I have prophecied, in opposition to all people, that something would come of Glen; but in the meantime must admit him to be as near as possible der<hi rend="italic">awntched</hi> [deranged]. His Father and Mother are well remembered here; unfortunate, not worthless people; they are said to have &#x201C;died of drinking&#x201D;; at any rate, of broken heart! Poor Glen has much from Nature and from Accident to struggle with; yet I still hope he will prevail.&#x2014; Of Edward Irving I hear nothing except thro&#x2019; the Newspapers; last <pb id="pg-06-220" n="06:220"/>week it was said they had taken a large House (now used as an Exhibition establishment) in Newman Street, Oxford St., and were to put a gallery in it, and were to preach and shriek there.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have got into a small perplexity here, in which I need your assistance. It relates to the grey mare.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-224" n="06:224"/>Last Wednesday afternoon, Jane and I thought of having a little drive in the Gig, and got yoked and seated accordingly, with the Beast all brushed and corned, whose behaviour on the last occasion, as on all previous ones, had given us no reason for distrust; least of all on the score of <hi rend="italic">temper</hi>. Nevertheless at the first crack of the whip what does the brute do but whirl round upon the Green, and attempt rearing; to the infinite terror of the Leddy, who forthwith dismounted, declaring she would venture no step farther. I reassured her; led and then drove, still with some uneasiness, to the outer gate; where, having discovered that the <hi rend="italic">choke-band</hi> was tighter than it should be, and slackened it, Jane was persuaded to get in again, and away we drove without farther sign of obstruction. All went well as possible, till we got to M&#x2019;Knight&#x2019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M&#x2019;Knight, a carrier to Dumfries. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281230-JWC-TC-01"><sic>4:438</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1828-12-30">30 Dec. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> whose wife and children were busy disloading his Cart (about 5 in the afternoon): the Beast made a kind of volunteer halt there, but easily enough went off again; and then about ten steps farther, we meet one of the Shoemaker&#x2019;s Children trailing a child&#x2019;s-cart, at which our quadruped took offence, and shied considerably, yet got past without splutter, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>&#x2014;simply set to work and kicked and plunged as if Satan were in her, till her harness is all in tatters, and as she still cannot get away, <hi rend="italic">lies down;</hi> whereupon I (who had sat doing or saying very little) step out, with my reins, seize the bridle, get Jane out, get the foolish brute free of her straps,&#x2014;and our gigging has reached an untimely end! The suddenness and then the quietness and calm deliberation of the business were matter of astonishment: one minute we are driving prosperously along, in three minutes more we are <hi rend="italic">gigless</hi>. M&#x2019;Knight&#x2019;s wife kept disloading her cart all the while, as if it had been nothing out of the common run. The poor woman is very stupid, and indeed in the family way at present. John however arrived before all was over, and helped us what he could. We borrowed an old saddle from him, and walked off; leaving the Gig-wreck in his warehouse: at Sandy Wells I set the poor Leddy on this old saddle, and leading the mare myself in all quietness arrived home in quite other equipment than we had departed. The Boy took Harry and a pair of Cart-ropes, and had the <hi rend="italic">Clatch</hi> home at dusk: it was far less injured than you would have thought; nothing broken but the leather-mass and two leather straps that fasten on the <hi rend="italic">splinter</hi>-bar (<hi rend="italic">swing</hi>-tree-bar) which the traces hook upon; and the under woodwork (I mean, the <hi rend="italic">continuation</hi> of the shaft, nearly above the axletree, on the <hi rend="italic">left</hi> side) rather bruised and twisted than broken. This <pb id="pg-06-225" n="06:225"/>the Vulcan has already mended, quite effectually, without difficulty. As for the harness, it is done utterly; flying in dozens of pieces: you never witnessed such a piece of work as I had to get it <foreign>thrummed</foreign> [put] together in any way, so that it would drive as far as the Smithy; a <hi rend="italic">Saddle</hi>-crupper fixed on it; one trace lengthened and a new <hi rend="italic">eye</hi> cut, the other shortened to the utmost (to make both equal); spliced bridle &#x26;c &#x26;c: the most Irish-looking vehicle perhaps ever seen in these parts. The question now remains: What is to be done?</p>
<p>As for the harness, all things considered, I ought not perhaps to be sorry that it is finished: we seldom went out without something in it breaking; and nobody knows how long one might have gone on cobbling and stitching, always throwing new money away. A quite fresh Harness can be got (a Saddler at Thornhill anxiously showed me one, nay two) for little more than five pounds; and it will be best that we are obliged to get a new one. I have no skill at all in these matters; and will not deal with the Thornhill man, till you and I have investigated Dumfries together, and found nothing better there. Harry will draw us at any rate thro&#x2019; winter; with the present tackle, one may bring the vehicle down to get new tackle, and that is all we can expect of it.</p>
<p>With regard to the Mare, I must now leave you to act for me, and judge for me. Jane has declared that she will drive with her no more; and indeed I think it were very unwise, unless with quite other security than any skill of mine. We must sell her then, I suppose, if anything like the value is to be had for her. The <hi rend="italic">old money</hi> would please me sufficiently; or, indeed, any money you think her worth. I may mention, however, my own persuasion that the Beast after all is thoroughly what is called <hi rend="italic">quiet;</hi> that it was my poor driving that mainly caused the accident: had I given her an effectual yerk with the whip when she first began kicking, or rather offering to kick, it had been all right. No shadow of <hi rend="italic">vice</hi> in the creature have I ever seen before or since.&#x2014; Unfortunately, as you see, she is in poorish condition for sale; one of the hind feet too has got the hair peeled, which perhaps could not grow in time. The Roodfair is in two weeks. I have no food here to fatten any quadruped; but Jamie, I think, has plenty of <hi rend="italic">clover,</hi> and you must take him into counsel. Indeed, he was once talking about <hi rend="italic">keeping</hi> her or some like her for her work till grass-time again: so here is another possibility for us. My persuasion is that any handy man could make this Mare still do anything he liked without difficulty; and perhaps had she got a winter of carting and ploughing and other sobering, she might be easier to deal with <pb id="pg-06-226" n="06:226"/>next summer. Manage as you see best. I think the horse a good one and very cheap: however, I have no reluctance to part with her. I do not think, she will ever <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> very handsomely with me; she is <hi rend="italic">flail-legged,</hi> skittish a little, and does not seem to thrive here (she has had oats and grass and <hi rend="italic">very</hi> little work); she does nothing well but the <hi rend="italic">jogtrot</hi>, and about <hi rend="italic">forty yards</hi> of cantering: her <hi rend="italic">sy</hi><hi rend="small-caps">news</hi> are quite loose under you. Larry was quite another at her age. I believe I must renounce the thought of a <hi rend="italic">riding</hi>-horse here; at all events, your little black mare would ride as well as <hi rend="italic">she</hi> yet does, and for all else would content me infinitely better. Again, I say, decide for me, and act for me.</p>
<p>I think there never was such a long-winded deluge of a Narrative poured out by me, as this same, on so small occasion! I am excessively stupid, tonight, and in haste too. So, my dear Brother, you must just interpret what I mean, by your own acuteness of wit.&#x2014; Send the Boy off <hi rend="italic">early</hi> on Tuesday morning; he has things to get at Dumfries. Of course you can send no <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> word what is to be done with the mare, till you have seen Jamie and consulted with him, and considered with yourself: but tell me when you can meet me at Dumfries to buy new Harness; and whether the Roodfair is the only day shortly you could come on, and whether that would do for the purpose. I like such gatherings very ill. Moreover, do not by any means leave your <hi rend="italic">harvesting</hi> for that errand: we are in no pressing haste.&#x2014; And so I conclude this confused interminable story of <hi rend="italic">The Gig Demolished</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pride gets a Fall</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle replied in his next letter that the Carlyles at Craigenputtoch should get a safer horse.</note></p>
<p>I am tolerably well (and so is Jane); my <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> is done within two days, and then I have five stern weeks of writing. Wish me good-speed! I must and will be thro&#x2019; it. We shall meet before then, I hope.&#x2014; I often think of you here, in these solitudes; and how the places that once knew you now know you no more, and I am left alone on the Moor. Courage! Let us stand to our tasks, and give the rest to the winds. We shall meet often yet, in spite of all; and often hear each that the other is behaving <hi rend="italic">like a brave man</hi>. I know no other <hi rend="italic">welfare</hi> in this Earth.&#x2014; Jean writes us that your house is roofed again; we rejoice to fancy you free from raindrops; and fronting the winter with better shelter. Catlinns will have a new face<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either the son, name unknown, who was to be born to Alexander and Janet Carlyle, and soon died; or just a new &#x201C;face&#x201D; to the house.</note> when I come,&#x2014;which will be, I trust, when this &#x2018;Article&#x2019; is over.&#x2014; You would see <pb id="pg-06-227" n="06:227"/>John&#x2019;s Letter; you would get the Review and the Printed Piece on Goethe. I can lend you other things of the Magazine kind: but suppose you to be far too busy for reading as yet. Tell me how goes your harvest; when you hope to be done. How you are all.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; You will soon see our dear Mother; tell her of our welfare, and that she will before long hear of us again. Thank Jean for her two Letters; say the Hat does excellently: no news I can get is so valuable to me as that our Mother and all of you are well. Love one another.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320122-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1832-01-22">22 Jan</date></ref>.</note> One day we shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> all be well any longer.&#x2014; Our kindest wishes to little Janekin and her Mother.

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I hope you noticed on the Newspaper a small announcement that I &#x201C;could not come&#x201D; to meet you tomorrow; so that no portion of your inducement to be at Dumfries might rest on my shoulders. I am not without a sort of persuasion that Tomorrow after all, if it be fine, may tempt you to stay at home for harvest work. For which reason I despatch this forward by your carrier Walters,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Walters, a Lockerbie carrier.</note> instead of directing it to be left for yourself with Shaw.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The shoemaker in Dumfries.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I have but a very little time at my disposal, and must be brief.</p>
<p>The Limbs of the Law summoned me down to Dumfries, on Saturday last, to &#x2018;serve as Juryman&#x2019;: I went; and answered to my name, about half past 10 o&#x2019;clock: this was all the duty I had to do. <pb id="pg-06-228" n="06:228"/>The case was a Sherriff&#x2019;s one; of a wretched <hi rend="italic">ragtail</hi> chimney-sweep, who had stolen an Ass value 20 shillings in the Parish of Ewes: they sentenced him to imprisonment; after which the fifty or sixty men who had been obliged to throw by their work and mount their horses on his account, were dismissed, and went their way.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As reported in the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> (<date when="1832-09-11">11 Sept.</date>) at the Court of Justiciary two prisoners, Daniel Galbraith and John Stewart, were brought to trial after being in prison for six months. Stewart, the first offender, received a sentence of six months; and Galbraith, who had been in prison before, was sentenced to transportation for seven years.</note> I contrived, however, to get all my little bits of business done; and so, being very much pressed by work here, was obliged to resolve on not losing <hi rend="italic">another</hi> day, even tho&#x2019; I had the prospect of meeting you there.</p>
<p>The rather, as I now find that we can do a while <hi rend="italic">without new Harness</hi>. I got an awl and threads up from Dumfries by the Boy, and have made the most surprising job of it; you would not know that anything had happened. Then, as we are to be away in winter, and so forth, it seemed to me the new Harness might spoil: besides, what is <supplied>[as]</supplied> true, there is no superfluity of money going just now. I have paid the Advocate (last Saturday), and have still a few pounds over, and more due: but it will all be wanted, and more too that I have yet to earn for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and its expenses. So will let the Harness lie: if you have any chance, pray inform yourself at the Saddler&#x2019;s what such a thing can be had for; it will be to purchase by and by, if we keep the <hi rend="italic">Clatch</hi> running; which, while resident here, I see not how we can help doing.</p>
<p>Jemmy and you, I daresay, will be at the Roodfair:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Dumfries on <date when="1832-09-25">25 Sept.</date></note> can you not come up hither at night, and see what we are doing, and rest yourselves till Saturday? I fear, not; and yet it is perhaps possible, if you are thro&#x2019; the Corn and the Potatoes not begun yet. We shall see.&#x2014; I hope there is no fear of your getting rid of that Grey Beast, on some sort of terms. I must just leave her in your charge; and since you have had so much trouble with her, let you finish her off.&#x2014; Harry, I find by last Saturday&#x2019;s trail, runs like a rein-deer in the gig; one of the <foreign>gleggest</foreign> little fellows, if you remind him that there is such a thing as a <hi rend="italic">whip</hi>. He is stout and thriving, but lazy,&#x2014;unless where you have such a chance for quickening him.</p>
<p>We know not yet when we go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; I have still much work to do: it cannot be till a month or so after Martinmas.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Observed on <date when="1832-11-11">11 Nov.</date></note> We have hired the old Servant, whom you gave a ride to last whitsunday: she can <pb id="pg-06-229" n="06:229"/>ride, yoke &#x26;c; so that we think of dismissing Robert, for whom there will be no work. Now on this latter point I had a message to you from Jane and partly from myself: it is to see whether Jamie needs a Boy of that kind thro&#x2019; winter, for I think he had one last winter, and <supplied>[th]</supplied>at this might suit him. He is expert enough with horses, rather a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Carter I think; willing to work, but totally unable to get thro&#x2019; with almost any work, unless there be some <hi rend="italic">commander</hi> near him, when he will stretch himself really handsomely enough. He performs pretty well (not exorbit<supplied>[ant]</supplied>ly) with the <hi rend="italic">s</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">poon</hi>]</supplied>, is not <supplied>[a bother, or]</supplied> in the least troublesome: but the thing th<supplied>[at in]</supplied>terests us above all things in him is the natural <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> the poor creature manifests; his love of Knowledge in all sorts; and what is of infinitely greater moment even than this, his innocence and veracity. We have never detected him telling the small<supplied>[es]</supplied>t falsehood, or so much as prevaricating. I could like well to fancy the poor creature in good hands, where he would see and hear honest sensible things said and done; and be stirred up and <hi rend="italic">sharpened,</hi> even by <hi rend="italic">roughish</hi> usage to put himself forth into exertion. He is very desirous, it seems, to learn husbandry work; and could easily learn it, had he a tight stirring master. Tell the Scotsbrig people about all this; and see whether they say anything. We shall likely send him down to the Fair at any rate, and he will see some of you at Beck&#x2019;s.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Beck, a coachmaker, 31 English St., in whose stables the horse was lodged when at Dumfries.</note></p>
<p>I have taken up all your sheet with this small <hi rend="italic">charitable</hi> matter, which is of a sort one ought not to neglect.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; There are four Numbers of <hi rend="italic">Fras</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">er&#x2019;s</hi>]</supplied> for you and a Life of <hi rend="italic">Mary Wolstoncroft</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310904-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-09-04">4 Sept. 1831</date></ref>.</note> (once a famous woman): I think they will serve you till we come down.&#x2014; Alas, I have a long <hi rend="italic">dour</hi> job before me first. But I am toiling at it, and it cannot last me long. Tell my dear Mother that I am as impatient to come as <supplied>[she]</supplied> can <supplied>[be to]</supplied> have me; that I will set off the very day I am at liberty; lastly that I think surely in four weeks from this date we may hope to <supplied>[see]</supplied> you.</p>
<p>It was cleverly done to slate your house with your &#x201C;own hand&#x201D; (as Edward Irving used to sign his name), and get it over before the Tirl-trees season.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The season when autumn winds twist the trees.</note> You will have a very tolerable place of it, heartsome in summer, stormtight in winter; I hope and believe it will not disappoint your modest calculations in other respects.

<p>Tell James of Scotsbrig that I have not forgotten the various slights he put upon me the day I was in Dumfries. first leaving the Inn without the smallest attempt at seeing me, secondly refusing my eloquent entreaties to take me home and lastly walking off without a civil good day&#x2014; Nevertheless I will try to forgive him if he come up from the Fair.

<salute>My Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>If Alick saw <supplied>[you, he]</supplied> would be speaking something of this Boy. Since then we have altered our figure a little. The poor honest <foreign>slut</foreign> of a Boy would very gladly have gone to Scotsbrig, if he went anywhither; but looked so inexpressibly <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> to go away at all, that we could not but resolve to leave him in peace. If he is worth his victuals to you, when we set out for Edinburgh, or at any time till we return, you shall have him: if not, he &#x201C;will go home; and get to the school a while.&#x201D; So it is settled.</p>
<p>I hope you are come to get me rid of that Mare, and will prosper some way. I believe her well worth the money you gave for her; but care not if I never see her face again. Catlinns and you will, I know, make the most of the market, and do for me far better than I could for myself.</p>
<p>We are in great &#x201C;wishfulness&#x201D; to know what is going on at Scotsbrig and at Catlinns; whether your Harvest is done, and well done, &#x26;c &#x26;c<supplied>[.]</supplied> Will you come up, and tell us: either, or both of you? <pb id="pg-06-232" n="06:232"/>Otherwise send word with the Boy. At worst, I will <hi rend="italic">come</hi> by and by, and see.</p>
<p>The Boy has a Basket of wares, and messages to do: then leave to look about him <hi rend="italic">till four o&#x2019;clock. Forward</hi> him at that hour, if he come in your way.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; My best Blessing with you both!</p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother (very busy), /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>

<salute>My dear Mother</salute>
<p>I am not satisfied, it should be even so much as <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;whispered&#x2019;</hi> that I have been <hi rend="italic">scared</hi> from Scotsbrig by the grate-Reform, or by any other cause. Surely I have come thro <hi rend="italic">earthquakes</hi> enough in my time, and with ane honourabble thro&#x2019; bearing,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300928-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1830-09-28">28 Sept. 1830</date></ref>.</note> to have acquired a character on that head more unimpeachable. But to be sure the calumny was no invention of yours; but of younger heads less eminent for charity. It was the long journey I boggled at on the last occasion; being in a despairing mood at the time with want of sleep; and dearly I rued every hour of my Husband<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>s absence that I had not accompanied him where if I must needs have been ill I might at least have been so without molestation. Another time we will do better!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quoted by Carlyle as a saying of Frederick the Great. Cf. <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XVI, 49; and <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230218-TC-JJ-01"><sic>2:288</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1823-02-18">18 Feb. 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Carlyle is toiling away at the new article;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Diderot,&#x201D; though TC has mistakenly written &#x201C;Diamond Necklace&#x201D; above the line.</note> and tho by no means content with the way he makes (when is he ever content?) still as you used to say what is down will not jump out again.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310621-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1831-06-21">21 June 1831</date></ref>.</note> In three weeks <pb id="pg-06-233" n="06:233"/>or so it will be done and then we come. I am certainly mended since you were here; but &#x201C;deed M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carle a&#x2019;s maist ashamed to sayt.&#x201D; a<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>s still weakly, and take no unusual fatigue without suffering for it. The toil and trouble I had about Betty did me a great mischief, which I have scarcely yet got over. for the rest that explosion has had no unpleasant consequence. The woman I got in her stead, on an investigation of three minutes, proves to be quite as clever a servant as she was whom I investigated for the space of three half years and rode, as I compute some hundred miles after. Deaf as a doornail the present individual has nevertheless conducted herself heretofore quite satisfactorily&#x2014;except that Carlyle&#x2019;s silk handkerchief is occasionally in requisition (oftener I sometimes think than there is any visible cause) wiping off particles of dust; and once by awful oversight a small mouse-<hi rend="italic">deed</hi> was permitted to insinuate itself into <hi rend="italic">his</hi> bowl of porridge! We are not to keep her however, because of her deafness, which in any other place where her ears would be called into vigourous action, would make her the mere effigy of a servant&#x2014; I get back the black button who was here when you came, who I know to be ignorant as a sucking child of almost every thing I require her to do; but whom I hope to find honest diligent good-humoured and moderately quick in the uptake.</p>
<p>I had a very kind letter from Mrs Montagu last week, reproaching me with forgetfulness of her.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu wrote: &#x201C;In what have I displeased you so that I am no longer to be thought of or asked after. &#x2026; You do not do Anna Procter justice, in supposing that she disliked you&#x2014; I believe she has a much greater sense of your good qualities and powers of mind than half the people you know, and she fancied you did not like her, for tho&#x2019; she took all opportunities of inviting you when she assembled those persons whom she thought amusing, she often observed that you had never asked her to visit you. &#x2026; And now my dear Thomas Carlyle, let me take you by the hand, and try to look into your clear kind eyes, as I used to do, to see whether sickness or sorrow troubled you, and to find in your answering glance, that patient content, &#x2018;which goodness bosoms ever&#x2019;&#x2014;very dear were you to me, when I saw in you only the germs of goodness, but how much dearer are you, when I see the fruit which those germs have produced&#x2014;love for the excellent, forgiveness for the wicked, and patient hope for all men&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> We have not heard from or of Jeffrey for a very long time; but he will certainly write on wednesday to acknowledge the repayment of his debt which, is a great load off our mind.</p>
<p>My Mother writes in great alarm about cholera which is at Penpont, within three miles of her. three persons have died. I have been expecting nothing else, and my dread of it is not greater for its being at hand. The Answer to all such terrors is simply what Carlyle said <pb id="pg-06-234" n="06:234"/>a year ago to someone who told him in London cholera is here&#x2014; &#x201C;When is death not here?&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s note: &#x201C;[Sheet <hi rend="italic">ends;</hi> cover, or sheet 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> lost]&#x201D;.</note></p>

<salute>My dearest Eliza</salute>
<p>&#x201C;It is surprising to see all how they <hi rend="italic">ack</hi> i&#x2019; the various places,&#x201D; as M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Jeffrey&#x2019;s Maid, who now poor creature, acts no longer on this planet, used to preface her travel&#x2019;s history on the dicky of her Master&#x2019;s chaise&#x2014;an Ominous beginning, which like our Mother&#x2019;s &#x201C;O I must tell you about Aberdeen!&#x201D; had always the effect of instantaneously scattering her fellowservants to the four winds as if a bombshell had been thrown into the midst of them. It is really surprising how they ack! not knowing but the next hour may be their last&#x2014;certain that a <hi rend="italic">last</hi> must come <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>&#x2014;yet leaving the most palpable duties undone as if there were all eternity to do them in. You may guess I am incited to this highly novel and striking reflection, by the consideration that my last letter to you has been left unanswered for one year and half&#x2014;that from anything I hear you are not even <hi rend="italic">remotely</hi> purposing to answer it&#x2014;have not a single compunctious visiting<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, I, v.</note> about the matter. Yet how many years and half think you, even at the longest allowance shall we remain sojourners together on the same earth? and how will the surviver [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] like to remember periods of silence like this when the possibility of friendly intercourse then for the first time, like all things <hi rend="italic">past,</hi> not only rightly estimated, but overestimated, will exist no more for ever? Nor in censuring you do I pretend alltogether to clear myself&#x2014;I should have written again and again<supplied>[.]</supplied> Not only Scripture which bids you turn the other cheek when one is smitten<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 5:39.</note>&#x2014;but my own experience of how naturally one may fall into a fault from which it is extremely difficult to get out, as well as kindness which is continually reminding me that you are my earliest friend<supplied>[;]</supplied> all counselled this&#x2014;but pride and indolence carried the day. In prolonged bad hea<supplied>[l]</supplied>th and worse spirits I judged there could be <pb id="pg-06-235" n="06:235"/>small call upon <supplied>[me]</supplied> to be sending letters out as it were, into infinite space&#x2014;no sound of them ever more heard&#x2014;still vainer seemed it to apply for simpathy [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to one who was apparently nowise concerning herself whether I remained behind in a nice flower-potted London churchyard, or returned in a state of total wreck to my own country. A few days before I left London a certain D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Allan said to Carlyle in a complimentary tone as I left the room&#x2014;&#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle has the remains of a fine woman!&#x201D; think of that now! at thirty to pass for a remains!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently Dr. Matthew Allen (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200519-TC-MAL-01"><sic>1:250</sic><corr>TC to MAL, <date when="1820-05-19">19 May 1820</date></corr></ref>). Ritchie has observed that in <hi rend="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</hi> (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>), ch. 29, Bailey Junior says something similar of Mrs. Gamp: &#x201C;There&#x2019;s the remain of a fine woman about Sairah.&#x201D; Jane Carlyle was later an appreciative friend of Dickens. Did he get the expression from her?</note> judge if I must not have suffered somewhat! and if loss of health and loss of looks were not a decent sort of excuse at least, for not enacting the amiable part of turning the second cheek, or in other words writing the second letter&#x2014; The short and the long of the matter is we are both in fault&#x2014;let us mutually forgive&#x2014;Kiss and be friends and draw this practical inference that indolence as the copy line says is truly the root of all evil&#x2014;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Tim. 6:10.</note></p>
<p>The special object of my breaking silence this day is to give you a commission which I think will gratify you&#x2014;not, of the petty needle and staylace sort&#x2014;but what think you? to look about in your walks between this and the beginning of winter for a little furnished house to contain my husband self and a maid for as many months as we see good to exchange our country life for your town one&#x2014; The grim prospect of another winter in this solitude is too frightful for my husband, who finds, that it is absolutely essential for carrying on not only his craft, but his existence to hear from time to time a little human speech<supplied>[;]</supplied> accordingly we are to neighbour you this wint<supplied>[er]</supplied> and let us see to make better of it than on <supplied>[the]</supplied> former occasion&#x2014; As to the manner of hou<supplied>[se]</supplied> I may begin by restricting your quest by three <supplied>[great]</supplied> limitations&#x2014;first it must be free of bugs, secondly of <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> noises&#x2014;and lastly of a high rent. such a place as that my Mother tenanted of Miss Sheriff would answer well enough&#x2014; perhaps Miss Dora if it were modestly suggested to her might make another migration into the country&#x2014;she never seemed to s<supplied>[t]</supplied>ay at home on any account but because she had a house on <supplied>[her]</supplied> hands. Henry Inglis represented Comely Bank as being inhabited now by strange haggard ruffian-looking people whose calling was questionable&#x2014;in that case it were no longer pleasant but otherwise I should <pb id="pg-06-236" n="06:236"/>still prefer it to any part of the new town&#x2014; a floor in the heart of the town were my last recource [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]&#x2014;any <hi rend="italic">suburban</hi> situation especially if self contained were preferable&#x2014;the nearer yourself the better and &#x2026; [JWC has deleted several words here and written &#x201C;Second thoughts are best&#x201D; under them.]. With respect to house room&#x2014;there would be required at least a sitting room and bedroom with some sort of adjunct that might be slept in &#x201C;at a time&#x201D;&#x2014;a kitchen and six feet for the Maid. a small patch of outdoors accom<supplied>[m]</supplied>odati<supplied>[on]</supplied> were extremely desirable where my husband might smoke&#x2014; It was most piteous to see him reduced to perform that process in London on the top of a cistern! looking as he stood perched aloft &#x201C;on that bad eminence&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> II, 6.</note> with the long pipe in his mouth, for all the world like the emblem over a Tobacconist&#x2019;s door.

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>You must not estimate my eagerness to hear from you by my promptitude in replying:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Mill&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1832-09-17">17 Sept.</date></note> I live in a region barren of great events; grudge sometimes to let &#x2018;the present agreeable Family&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A phrase of Fonblanque&#x2019;s about the royal family.</note> derive any Postage from my friends for small ones. Really this latter consideration is not without influence on me: I think, were I Member of a Reformed Parliament, there should no day pass but ten Good-morrows, sure of an unmixed reception, would depart from me; and, were it possible, fifteen come in. If I have any regret in the prospect of missing my Election, this is mainly it. In the actual case, moreover, before the projected time of your return from Cornwall had passed, I was over head and ears anew in Scribbling; a business that almost drives me distracted, at least that I cannot bear to interrupt. Late last night I finished;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His &#x201C;Diderot.&#x201D;</note> and now, you see, this morning I am with you.</p>
<p>Your Letter gave me insight into many very pleasant things, in your own faithful way. I beg you will by no means let me lose sight of London; least of all, of your circle therein; many things of value for me lie in it, which may yet become of more value. In London alone of all places in this country have I found some men (belonging to this century and not to a past one) who believed that Truth was Truth: of such men, how obstructed otherwise soever, all may be hoped, for they have attained the source of all. Considered as European Thinkers, our poor Utilitarians make the mournfullest figure: yet in this one fact, that they were the re-originators of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> Belief among us, they stand far above all other Sects. Young minds too will not <hi rend="italic">end</hi> where they began: under this point of view, you and certain of yours are of great interest for me; indeed, I may say, form the chief <hi rend="italic">visible</hi> encouragement I have to proceed in this rather hazardous course of mine. And yet, hazardous? What hazard is there? While I have a whinstone stronghold here among the Peat-bogs, as much Potatoe-ground, and two arms to dig it with, as the natural man <pb id="pg-06-238" n="06:238"/><hi rend="italic">needs;</hi> and overhead the everlasting Heavenly Vault, and my <hi rend="small-caps">Sender</hi> there! There is no other way of it: <foreign><hi rend="italic">jacta est alea</hi></foreign> [the die is cast], as Ulrich Hutten<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291221-TC-DA-01">TC to DA, <date when="1829-12-21">21 Dec. 1829</date></ref>.</note> said;&#x2014;or rather, as the old Ecclefechan Blacksmith once, in threatening circumstances, phrased it: &#x201C;Then, we must just do the best we can for a living, Boy!&#x201D; Poor old Smeal (that was his name): he toiled faithfully with hammer and anvil, till past ninety, that he might keep <hi rend="italic">free,</hi> that he might not <hi rend="italic">beg: he</hi> did so; and we&#x2014;? Shame on us!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But to get on with business. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> has come in the most punctual manner, ever since the complaint I made you of it. We will let it alone therefore; at least, till it get wrong again. I think I have recognised little of you there lately: you do not <hi rend="italic">always</hi> write in it then? Fonblanque, as you say, seems but indifferently at ease; my wonder is great how a man of his sharp faculties, keen genial nature, can <hi rend="italic">go</hi> on (not to say gallop on) in that course, without bolting. Day after day he declares with cutting emphasis: &#x201C;Man of office, this thing thou sayest and doest is <hi rend="italic">not true:</hi> what art <hi rend="italic">thou?</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;A Liar, and the truth is not in me,&#x2014;and need not be sought out of me,&#x201D; the Man of Office would have answered sufficiently for most; nevertheless our friend still asks. That a dull workhorse of an Editor should still ask, with ever new eagerness, is not wonderful; but that a Fonblanque should and can almost surprises me. Is it your prediction that he will abide to the last by Politics? One might regret it: he is of far too broad and generous spirit for that narrow service; which, out of England at this day, he would never have gone into. But here too perhaps: <foreign><hi rend="italic">jacta est alea!</hi></foreign> Offer him my kind wishes and regards. I feel much sympathy and community with him: but for myself, am quite weary of Politics; and carefully avoid speaking of the subject (so far as I can); I never do speak of it, without emitting more or less of a sulphurous indignation improper for me, or for anyone. However, Each to his trade!</p>
<p>I have had some late Numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review:</hi> my chief conquest, I fear, was admiration renewed, at the &#x2018;Completeness of Limited men.&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> No Westminster-Reviewer doubts but <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is at the centre of the secret, com<supplied>[m]</supplied>anding free view of the Whole; and so he &#x2018;rides pro<supplied>[s]</supplied>perously,&#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> without variableness or misgiving. Ought it to be so? I sometimes think, Yes: let every man feel as if his function were the sole one, he will do it the better. You can perhaps tell <pb id="pg-06-239" n="06:239"/>me who that loud-spoken, firm-nerved, cut-and-sever Master of Logic-fence there, is, who writes much, often about Cornlaws and Poorlaws; and must have written (I fancy) that most limited-triumphant Disquisition on the poor Saint-Simonians.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In reply on <date when="1832-10-22">22 Oct.</date> Mill identified him as Thomas Perronet Thompson (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>), lieut.-colonel, politician, and writer, who was proprietor and editor of the <hi rend="italic">Westminister Review,</hi> <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">36</date>. He was M.P. for Hull, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">37</date>, and for Bradford, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>. The article, &#x201C;Saint-Simonianisme,&#x201D; appeared in XVI (<date when="1832-04-00">April 1832</date>), 279&#x2013;321. Mill remarked on him that he was &#x201C;a man of very extensive acquirements&#x201D; who had &#x201C;seen much of the world,&#x201D; and who had &#x201C;an understanding like a pin, going very far into a thing, but never covering a larger portion of it than the area of a pin&#x2019;s point.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; By the way, I owe you many thanks for your few sentences on that matter of their Trial, which I had elsewhere inquired after in vain.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1832-01-23">23 Jan. 1832</date> the French government had acted against the St.-Simonians, closed their &#x201C;temple,&#x201D; and forbidden them to assemble. On <date when="1832-08-27">27 August</date>, Enfantin and several of his disciples were brought to trial. It was an occasion for dramatic speeches, and what may seem surprisingly mild punishment. There were some fines, and Enfantin, Duveyrier, and Chevalier were each sentenced to a year&#x2019;s imprisonment. But the association was effectively broken up.</note> If you have any pamphlets, books, or even newspaper-leaves about it to lend me, I should still be glad of them. I sometimes even think of writing about it,&#x2014;in some dialect or other; had I materials. Enfantin becomes quite intelligible to me from my knowledge of Edward Irving. The Enthusiast nowise excludes the Quack; nay rather (especially in such times as these) presupposes him. Do you know where Gustave d&#x2019;Eichthal is? Or what Duverryer [<hi rend="italic">sic:</hi> Duveyrier] makes of himself in prison? Which <hi rend="italic">is</hi> their prison?</p>
<p>Your promised Magazines were expected last Wednesday, at least partly; but did not come. The Cholera is at Dumfries, rather violent; and the people in a shocking panic, so that all communication is obstructed; and a parcel <hi rend="italic">may</hi> still be there. We shall see tomorrow: happily the Disease is fast abating. The terror of the world at this Pestilence is such as if Death had never before been heard of. Nevertheless Death is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> new; moreover, come when or how it will, it should find us <hi rend="italic">at our work,</hi> and thinking mainly of our work.&#x2014; Do not mind <hi rend="italic">Tait</hi> even if you had it; there are enough of them in Dumfries; and, alas, they are hardly worth carrying even so far, not to speak of buying. What will become of Tait? He is <hi rend="italic">white</hi>-puffing (for there is a white and a black sort); that seems to be his main stay at present; but by nature it cannot last. The Fox Periodical<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written a review of a work by John Austin for <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine,</hi> II, (<date when="1832-12-00">Dec. 1832</date>), 343&#x2013;8, which Carlyle first tells him not to bother to send; then he contributed &#x201C;On Genius&#x201D; to the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository,</hi> VI (<date when="1832-10-00">Oct. 1832</date>), 649&#x2013;59. As he explained in his letter to TC of <date when="1832-09-17">17 Sept.</date>, the latter was edited by W. J. Fox (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), preacher, politician, and journalist. For Fox and his periodical, see Mineka, <hi rend="italic">The Dissidence of Dissent: The Monthly Repository, <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">38</date></hi> (Chapel Hill, <date when="1944-00-00">1944</date>).</note> I shall <pb id="pg-06-240" n="06:240"/>be very glad to see: I cannot fish out your piece in the last Table of Contents; where indeed one has few data.

See also <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300127-TC-MN-01">TC to MN, <date when="1830-01-27">27 Jan. 1830</date></ref>.</note> downwards there is a certain mechanical metallic <hi rend="italic">deadness</hi> at the heart of all of them; rhetorical clangour enough, but no fruit for me. Unluckily too they seem a sort of Half-men; which class of Nature&#x2019;s products one has the least patience with. But let us, in all conscience, <hi rend="italic">look</hi> first! I know Fox only by his political Speeches; the lowest class of human compositions, and these very ill reported.</p>
<p>This thing of mine that I have been writing is a long Essay on <hi rend="italic">Diderot;</hi> which you will see most probably in the Cochrane Review, this Number or next. It is a wearisome straggling affair; and to you will not communicate much; tho&#x2019; readers enough may learn from it, if they will please to look. Cochrane informs me, with hair on end, that the general or rather universal opinion about the <hi rend="italic">Goethe</hi> production was&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">unfavourable!</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cochrane had written thus from Edinburgh (<date when="1832-09-10">10 Sept.</date>) about the essay &#x201C;Goethe&#x2019;s Works&#x201D;: &#x201C;I am grieved to say, but candour at the same time compels me to say it&#x2014;that this last paper on Goethe does not appear to have given anything like satisfaction. The remarks, written &#x26; verbal, that have been made to me, from London&#x2014;here&#x2014;and from all quarters&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">without a single exception</hi>&#x2014;have been eminently unfavorable. One of the gentlest, which occurs in a letter received this very day from London, I copy, as there is a little jocularity in it about one portion of the article.<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;&#x2018;By the way Mr C&#x2014; is most stupendously impudent: I think his Professor Teufelsdreck of <place>Weiss-nicht-wo</place> admirable: but how many of your readers, think you, will look in the University Calendar of Cloudland for his name? Depend upon it, more than one wise head has already built a theory upon it, that the German Professors have very queer names, and consequently very queer doctrines. <foreign><hi rend="italic">En reste,</hi></foreign> I should have liked the Goethe better, had the author been a little more content to be himself, and a little less determined upon wearing Jean Paul&#x2019;s party-coloured feathers.&#x2019;&#x201D;<lb/><lb/>
In his <hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> ca. <date when="1832-09-20">20 Sept.</date>, Carlyle wrote: &#x201C;Opinions of the Article <hi rend="italic">Goethe,</hi> Cochrane writes, are &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">all</hi> eminently unfavourable&#x2019;: the &#x2018;eminently&#x2019; he has inserted on second thoughts, by means of a <hi rend="italic">caret</hi>. He is a wondrous man, to see editing, that Cochrane: what we might call an <hi rend="italic">editing Pig,</hi> as there are learned Pigs, &#x26;c. He is very punctual in <hi rend="italic">paying,</hi> and indeed generally; that is his only merit. Use him sharply, almost contemptuously, and he remains civil, and does better than most.&#x2014; Bibliopoly, Bibliopoesy, in all their branches are sick, sick; hastening to <hi rend="italic">death,</hi> and new <hi rend="italic">geneses</hi>. Enough! <foreign>Ach gar zu viel</foreign> [oh, all too much]!&#x201D;</note> Good Heaven! had not &#x2018;the age of miracles&#x2019; ceased? I answer poor Cochrane as I can: the proper answer <pb id="pg-06-241" n="06:241"/>would have been <hi rend="italic">a glass of brandy</hi>. In my own secret heart, I know that Paper to be not a stupid, yet a baddish one: the problem set before me was of the impossible kind; this was the approximation I could make to it. To <hi rend="italic">elucidate</hi> that subject to English readers, at this point of time, lying beyond me, nothing remained but to coruscate round it with what fireworks one had; uttering in any case n<supplied>[othing]</supplied> but what seemed true, so far as it went.&#x2014; You are very charitable in construing my hydra-hea<supplied>[ded]</supplied> method of publishing myself&#x2014;thro&#x2019; so many monstrous Periodicals all at once. Alas, it is that I have no better bethod [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]; otherwise it were to be named a bad one. I had hoped that by and by I might get out of Periodicals altogether, and write Books: but the light I got in London last winter showed me that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was as good as over. My Editors of Periodicals are my Book-sellers, who (under certain new and singular conditions) purchase and publish my <hi rend="italic">Books</hi> for me; a monstrous method, yet still a method. &#x201C;Allah is Great&#x201D; as the Arabs say: there is ever <hi rend="italic">some</hi> resource left; and Meditation, like Murder, will out. A question often suggests itself, whether we shall never have <hi rend="italic">our own</hi> Periodical Pulpit, and <hi rend="italic">exclude</hi> the Philistine therefrom, above all, keep the Pew-opener (or Bibliopolist) in his place; and so preach nothing but the sound word? The Answer, however, comes not. Meanwhile: Speak! Preach! The Night Cometh.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 9:4.</note> Where men are, there is an audience: &#x201C;you may make a Pulpit by inverting any Tub&#x201D;!

I once loved Edinburgh, and still do not hate it. I hope some day you and I shall see it together.&#x2014; Has Napier yet sent your Books? I am quite shocked to find the state of things; and dread, it is not yet rectified: I have found the man very remiss in other matters.

<p>My Dame begins to get surprised that Mrs Austin does not write. <pb id="pg-06-242" n="06:242"/>We keep hoping however that it is not <hi rend="italic">distress</hi> of her own or husband&#x2019;s that prevents her.

But Boswells are almost as rare as Johnsons.&#x2014; You will now be quite master of Cornwall transactions: tell me if Charles Buller accounts himself sure of Liskard; what he is doing, meaning to do. A fine faculty is in my good Charlie; it were a thousand pities he should go to waste.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was elected for Liskeard shortly afterwards.</note>&#x2014; I am but beginning to write; and my poor sheet, save it as I may, is done. If among your modern French Books you can spare me any that really illustrate the late condition of that country (under <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of its aspects) they were highly welcome. Politics of course is one aspect; not for me the greatest, far from that; yet the easiest come at&#x2014;thro&#x2019; Books. Any tolerable History of the Revolution I could still read with interest. I am very curious about France. Indeed I thank Heaven I have still a boundless curiosity about all human <hi rend="italic">things:</hi> it is only <hi rend="italic">simulacra</hi> of things that I cannot away with.

<p><salute>My dear Uncle&#x2014;</salute> Judge if I am anxious to hear from you! Except the silence of the Newspapers, I have no evidence that you are still spared. The Disease, I see, has been in your street; in Shaw&#x2019;s; in Jamie Aitken&#x2019;s; it has killed your friend Thomson:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Thomson, builder, 12 Friar&#x2019;s Vennel.</note> who knows what further was its appointed work! You I strive to figure in the meanwhile, as looking at it, in the universal terror, with some calmness, as knowing and practically believing that your days, and the days of those dear to you, were now, as before and always, in the hand of God only; <hi rend="italic">from</hi> whom it is vain to fly; <hi rend="italic">towards</hi> whom lies the only refuge of man. Death&#x2019;s thousand doors have ever stood open; this indeed is a wide one, yet it leads no farther than they all lead.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cholera broke out in Dumfries on <date when="1832-09-15">15 Sept.</date> and within a week was rife throughout the district. A special hospital was soon overcrowded since there were 837 officially reported cases, of which 422 were fatal. Doctors were called in from as far away as Edinburgh, three of whom died. Many of the inhabitants left. Yet within two or three weeks the worst was over, and the last recorded death was on <date when="1832-11-27">27 Nov.</date> See <hi rend="italic">The New Statistical Account of Scotland</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), IV, 6&#x2013;10. In his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> Carlyle also spoke of the cholera: &#x201C;Monday, <date when="1832-10-01">1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> October</date>.&#x2014; Cholera at Dumfries, and <hi rend="italic">said</hi> to be in this immediate neighbourhood, the people all in panic: fools! Yesterday, at Church, while the Minister was preaching about it, or rather while a psalm was singing allusive to it, I saw a Lady take to weeping, and so lose self-command that she had to move out. Happily the main body of the people are too eupeptic, hardworked and stupid, to go far into panics.&#x2014; We have had a Medical Board in London, which seems to have done nothing or little but frighten people, and plague them with quarantines &#x26;c &#x26;c. Blockheads! Blockheads! What is there new in cholera? Death has not been new here for the last six thousand years. A Medical Board<hi rend="italic">kin</hi> to be established <hi rend="italic">here</hi> on Thursday: I doubt I am too busy to go. Busy with <hi rend="italic">Diderot;</hi> which turns out very indifferently.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Our Boy was in the town a fortnight ago (for I believe, by experience, the infectious influence to be trifling, and quite inscrutable to man; therefore go and send whithersoever I have <hi rend="italic">business,</hi> in spite of cholera); but I had forgot that he would not naturally see Shaw or some of you, and gave him no letter; so got no tidings. He will call on you to-morrow; and in any case bring a verbal message. If you are too hurried to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> in time for him, send a letter next day &#x201C;to the care of Mrs. Welsh, Templand, Thornhill&#x201D;: tell me only that you are all spared alive!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-244" n="06:244"/>We are for Annandale, after Thornhill, and may possibly enough return by Dumfries. I do not participate in the panic. We were close beside cholera for many weeks in London: &#x201C;every ball has its billet.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.

<p>I hear the Disease is fast abating. It is likely enough to come and go among us; to take up its dwelling with us among our other maladies. The sooner we grow to compose ourselves beside it, the wiser for us. A man who has reconciled himself <hi rend="italic">to die</hi> need not go distracted at the <hi rend="italic">manner</hi> of his death.</p>
<p>God make us all ready; and be His time ours!&#x2014;No more tonight.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I fear we have got again into a sort of perplexity with our Correspondence. About three weeks ago, I received your Castellmare Letter; having sent one off, which I might have expected would be in your hands about the same time:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The two brothers had written on the same day, <date when="1832-08-31">31 Aug.</date></note> that of mine however was directed to Naples, which City you appear to have quitted sooner than calculated on. If you have left no Agent there to forward Letters (which however is unlikely) there will be a pretty lacuna! In that Letter, I said it would be better in future that we wrote in the <hi rend="italic">single</hi> Letter-and-Answer way (without <hi rend="italic">overlapping</hi> one another, as now); but that in any case I would study to follow your instructions for the immediately <hi rend="italic">next</hi> time. No very precise instruction, however was given; only in a corner of the sheet I found: &#x201C;direct to Rome <hi rend="italic">as usual</hi>.&#x201D; Alas, I had directed nothing to Rome; and this is the first thing I send thither. My last Naples Letter in point of <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> was at least equal to two of your Castellmare one; and as I was quite immersed in &#x2018;composition&#x2019; at the time, and had not stirred from Craigenputtoch in the interval, or spoken above about four words in the day to any creature, it seemed better to wait. I finished my &#x2018;composition&#x2019; the day before yesterday; am bound for Annandale in the end of the week: and so here we are. I will not seal this till I have seen our <pb id="pg-06-245" n="06:245"/>Mother, for I have <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> nothing of them in a positive shape for many weeks (by the blame of Jamie in part): but they will tell us by word of mouth; and may even send you a marginal greeting with their own hand. It is within the reach of possibility that our Boy may bring us up a new Letter from you today (which is Wednesday); but I fear not likely. Write to me, at all rates, the moment you receive this; and then let us begin <hi rend="italic">regularly</hi>.</p>
<p>As I said, there is little or nothing to be written of Transactions, where the changes of Weather and of Nervous Sensibility are almost our only events. You can picture out Puttoch, and how I now sit here (in the Library) with a blazing fire of peats and coals, careless of the damp surly Elements, having only Dulness to struggle with. We keep a Famulus<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The boy, Robert McWhir.</note> to go errands, yoke the gig, curry the cattle, and so forth; who proves very useful to us. Jane is sitting in the Dining-room, reads, sews, rules her household, where cow, hens, human menials, gardencrop, all thi<supplied>[n]</supplied>gs animate and inanimate need looking to. She is not quite so brisk as she was, and the Trefoil has long been discontinued: however, she is certainly far better than while in London, and on the whole continuing to gather strength. The gray Mare about six weeks ago kicked her harness to pieces with us, down at John M&#x2019;Knight&#x2019;s, without the smallest provocation; but did <hi rend="italic">us</hi> no damage, I even brought home the Dame on her back: however, such conduct was not to be dreamt of; so we despatched the animal to Alick, to make ready for the &#x2018;Roodfair&#x2019;; who as we since vaguely learn (for they have not even informed us of this) has sold her to Jamie, that he, in carts and plough-harness, may teach her &#x2018;another road to the well.&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably proverbial.</note> With unexampled dexterity, having procured an Awl and Threads from Dumfries, I mended the old harness again (indiscernibly to the naked eye); and now little Harry draws us, and makes no bones of the matter, being in good heart, and well provided with fodder both &#x2018;long&#x2019; and &#x2018;short.&#x2019; That is the way we manage. All lies tight and sufficient round us, and need not be in disorder: we want for nothing in the way of earthly proviant, and have many reasons to be content and diligent. Recreations we have none; a walk, a ride, on some occasions a combined <hi rend="italic">drive</hi> for health&#x2019;s sake alone: Miss Whigham (of Allanton)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a sister of George Whigham, owner of Allanton, a country house in Dunscore.</note> called here the other day; and this simply is our <hi rend="italic">only</hi> call since we came from London! Poor William Corson, indeed, bounces <pb id="pg-06-246" n="06:246"/>up about once in the month to tea: but he is nigh distracted, and one cannot count him. I tried the Schoolmaster, but he is a poor rawboned <foreign>Grampus</foreign> [Ignoramus],&#x2014;whom I lent a Book to, but could get no more good of. I have tried some of the Peasants, but these also without fruit. In short, mortal communion is not to be had for us here: what then but do without it? Peter Austin (of Carstamon, <hi rend="italic">Castra-montium;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s etymology is improbable; more likely the word is from Gaelic <hi rend="italic">cas</hi> (foot) <hi rend="italic">tramon</hi> (elder bush).</note> we too have had our Romans!) is very useful to us; a decent punctual man, the shrewdest of these parts. On the whole I do not think I shall ever get anythi<supplied>[n]</supplied>g better than a cheap and very peculiar <hi rend="italic">Lodging</hi> here; no Home I imagine has been appointed. For whom <hi rend="italic">is</hi> such appointed? The most have not even a Lodging,&#x2014;except by sufferance.&#x2014; Be this as it may, Cochrane had paid me for the Article <hi rend="italic">Goethe,</hi> and adding this to what elsewhere could be packed together I (on that Dumfries Jury-day; for I was summoned thither to act in that way about three weeks ago) I converted the whole into a Bank-letter, and paid off the Lord Advocate, &#x2018;<foreign>plack</foreign> and <foreign>bawbee</foreign>&#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Plack&#x201D; and &#x201C;bawbee&#x201D; are both small copper coins; so that Carlyle means &#x201C;down to the last halfpenny.&#x201D;</note> (&#xa3;43&#x201D;10 for you; &#xa3;60 for myself); and now except &#xa3;11&#x201D;2 to you (&#xa3;100 <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> &#xa3;45&#x201D;8 to Alick and this &#xa3;43&#x201D;10) owe no man any money. Be the Heavens thanked for that, at all events! The Advocate acknowledges his debt cleared: it is the only thing we have heard of him for a great while. I imagine, our relation is a good deal cooled; and may now be visibly to him, as it has long been visibly to me, a rather fruitless one. His world is not our world: he dwells in the glitter of saloon chandeliers, walking in the &#x2018;vain show&#x2019; of Parliamenteering and Gigmanity, which also he feels to be vain; we in the whirlwind and wild-piping Battle of Fate, which nevertheless, by God&#x2019;s grace, we feel to be not vain and a show, but true and a reality. Thus may each, without disadvantage, go his several way. If Jeffrey&#x2019;s well-being ever lay within my reach, how gladly would I increase it! But I hope better things for him; tho&#x2019; he is evidently declining in the world&#x2019;s grace, and knows as well as the world that his Political career has proved a nonentity. Often have I lamented to think that so genial a nature had been (by the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Zeitgeist,</hi></foreign> who works such misery) turned into that frosty unfruitful course. But as George Rae said: <supplied>[&#x2018;]</supplied>D&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; you, be <hi rend="italic"><foreign>wae</foreign> for yourself!</hi>&#x2019; So there we leave it,&#x2014; On that same Jury-day (where by the by nothing was given me to do, but answer to my name, under penalties) I got the Proofsheets of that 
<pb id="pg-06-247" n="06:247"/><hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> concern &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">The Tale</hi> <hi rend="italic">by Goethe,</hi>&#x201D; which is his leading item for this Month, but has not got hither yet. It is not a bad thi<supplied>[n]</supplied>g; the Commentary cost me but a day, and does well enough. The produce belongs to my little Dame, to buy pins for her: she got it as present long ago, at the <hi rend="italic">Hill:</hi> and reckoned it unavailable. The other Translation (mentioned in other Letters) follows close, next month. Fraser also applied for a Paper on <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Walter Scott&#x201D;:</hi> I declined, having a great aversion to that obituary kind of work, so undertaker-like; but said I might perhaps do it afterwards. This thing I have been cobbling together last, is a long (fifty-page) Paper on <hi rend="italic">Diderot</hi> for Cochrane,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">when</hi> I do not specially know.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlylse&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> entry of <date when="1832-10-15">15 October</date> had said: &#x201C;Finished <hi rend="italic">Diderot:</hi> sick, and very tired.&#x201D;</note> I had an immense reading, to little purpose otherwise; and am very glad to have it all behind me. And now after a few days&#x2019; sight of Friends, I must back hither into the wold, and dig a little more. We are not for Edinburgh till six weeks hence (for we change our servant at Martinmas<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1832-11-11">Nov. 11</date>.</note>); so there is time to do somethi<supplied>[n]</supplied>g previously. I shall have funds enough: there is this thi<supplied>[n]</supplied>g; Napier too owes me above sixty pounds, some of it for nine or ten months, and seems to be shy of paying. I shall see better what he means in Edinburgh. His <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> except for Macauley [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] (who as yet has only sung old songs, of Liberalism and the like, with a new windpipe) is the utterest &#x201C;Dry rubbish shot here&#x201D;:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macaulay had written reviews: LIV (<date when="1831-12-00">Dec. 1831</date>), of Southey&#x2019;s edition of the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress,</hi> 450&#x2013;61, and of Lord Nugent&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Memorials of Hampden,</hi> 505&#x2013;50; LV (<date when="1832-04-00">April 1832</date>), of Nare&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Lord Burghley,</hi> 271&#x2013;96, and (<date when="1832-07-00">July 1832</date>), of Dumont&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Recollections of Mirabeau,</hi> 552&#x2013;76.</note> yet by a kind of fatality it may linger on who knows how long, and perhaps Naso<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Napier.</note> does think my moisture would improve it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">A la bonne heure</hi></foreign> [Well and good]<hi rend="italic">!</hi> There are plenty of Able Editors zealous enough to employ me: this is all the &#x2018;fame&#x2019; (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Fama Dira</hi></foreign> [Fearful Fame]!) I fall in with&#x2014;or need. So that when you come home, Doctor, there will be a considerable volume for you to read; and I, in the interim, have lived thereby.&#x2014; We have sent to Eliza Stoddart [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to be looking out <supplied>[for]</supplied> a small furnished House for us; that is the way we mean to do: lodgings we could not venture on again so <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>. I do not mean to work much there for a while, but to <hi rend="italic">ask</hi> and <hi rend="italic">look,</hi> that makes me the busier at present. It is three years since I have been absent; and several thi<supplied>[n]</supplied>gs will be changed. Did you hear of their meeting at Edinburgh for a Monument to Sir Walter Scott? It was the best they <pb id="pg-06-248" n="06:248"/>could do, poor fellows: why not acknowledge it as such? If the whole matter, alas, seemed hollow, flimsy, theatrical, and nine-tenths false, there was a one-tenth of Truth at the bottom; and for this decimal fraction we will put up with all the rest.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A meeting was held in the Great Assembly Rooms on <date when="1832-10-05">5 Oct.</date>, when the Duke of Buccleuch proposed a resolution expressing its &#x201C;sentiments of the highest admiration for the genius and talents of Sir Walter Scott,&#x201D; whose &#x201C;glory &#x2026; seems destined to be as durable as the language&#x201D; he wrote in. Jeffrey proposed the second resolution that &#x201C;a Public Memorial should be erected&#x201D; in Edinburgh to his memory, &#x201C;fitted to convey to future times an adequate testimony of the estimation in which he was held by his contemporaries.&#x201D; &#xa3;1,100 was raised at the meeting; Jeffrey laid the foundation stone in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>; and the monument was inaugurated, <date when="1846-08-15">15 Aug. 1846</date> (Scott&#x2019;s birthday), at a total cost of &#xa3;15,650. Carlyle recorded his thoughts on Scott&#x2019;s death in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>. See Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle,</hi> II, 310&#x2013;11.</note>&#x2014; As to the printing of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck,</hi> it lies over for better insight; shall not be attempted, at all events, till I have money of <hi rend="italic">my own,</hi> to pay the piper. Your offer, dear Jack, is kind, brotherly, suitable; neither shall you be forbid to pay for &#x2018;debts,&#x2019; and much more (if you come to have the means, and we prove both <hi rend="italic">worthy</hi>): but in the meanwhile it is madness to reap corn not yet in the ear (or kill the goose for her golden eggs&#x2014;if you like that figure better); your great outlook at present is to get yourself set up in Medical Practice; for which end all the money you can possibly save will be essential. Should you ever come to be a successful Doctor (and that tho&#x2019; a difficult, is almost the only success not an impossible one for the sternest honesty), who knows what all may be done: in any case, I look to see you a faithful Doctor; a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> not an imaginary worker in that field whereto God&#x2019;s Endowment has qualified and appointed you: the rest, I can say honestly, is within the merest trifle of indifferent [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to me. How <hi rend="italic">long</hi> (were there nothing more in it) will it las<supplied>[t]</supplied>! Walter Scott is now poorer than I am; has left all his <hi rend="italic">wages</hi> behind: if he spoke the Truth, it was well for him; if not, not well. As to the <hi rend="italic">anonymity</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Teufels</hi>k, it is an <hi rend="italic">aesthetic</hi> objection, not a prudential one: there is perhaps no man in Europe that needs to trouble himself less with that same Prudence; hoping nothing what thing should I fear? Nay, could I be sure of all the world&#x2019;s knowing the Book to be mine, it would answer me better. But we shall see the Book, after all, is little other than a <hi rend="italic">dud;</hi> what I most want is to be rid of it.</p>
<p>And now, dear Doctor, here surely is enough about my poor <hi rend="italic">Upputting</hi> [situation] and manner of Working or Bungling<supplied>[.]</supplied> Could I prevail on you to write as minute a <foreign><hi rend="italic">realistische</hi></foreign> account, it were <pb id="pg-06-249" n="06:249"/>something. Nay I am not half done yet: but space must be left for what may occur till Saturd<supplied>[a]</supplied>y; the sheet cannot go till then. Of external news greatly the most momentous is that <hi rend="italic">Cholera</hi> has been at Dumfries for some three weeks; but seems now to be rapidly abating. It was rather beyond the average in violence, and the terror of the whole region has been immeasurable. Even up here, they were going about with open mouth and staring eyes, wonderful to behold. Macdiarmid had sounded the note of preparation for some thirteen months, and when it came, all flew into pitiable distraction. The quantity of real understanding in mankind must be very inconsiderable. All carriers have stopt for these three weeks (for that reason our Boy is down) all marketting [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], not even milk could be brought in. I understand by experience the infectious influence to be ve<supplied>[r]</supplied>y inconsiderable; above all, the whole thing to be <hi rend="italic">inscrutable,</hi> that can neither be kept out, nor fled from, nor remedied when there: if it is to kill us, then it will kill us, but should find us <hi rend="italic">at our work,</hi> and not thinking of what we can <hi rend="italic">do nothing more</hi> in, but of what we can <hi rend="italic">do something</hi> in. They behaved best in London: after all that the Long-eared individuals named Medical Board had hoped (whose bray is said to affright lions) the rational people went about their business, and none but glaring <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gomerils</hi></foreign> [Blockheads] (like George Irving) were to be heard even speaking about cholera: the very populace, in their rude-way, took heart, and called it the &#x201C;Cholera Humbug.&#x201D; We here have got two bottles of the best Brandy, with some Laudanum or Paregoric (I rather think the latter) as simple universal stomachic stimulants: I could never hear of aught else the whole noisy Faculty had yet hit upon. We do not expect that the Disease will come hither; and shall not surely go to seek <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> if we have no <hi rend="italic">business:</hi> but live in that &#x201C;humble boldness&#x201D; which at <hi rend="italic">all</hi> times (even as now, for when were we not liable <hi rend="italic">to die?</hi>) beseems god-created Men. I have no doubt, our Mother is in the same mind: these are the times when it is seen whether one has anything in himself, or merely depends upon outward accident only. There are one or two persons known to us who have perished (Thomson the Architect): whether any more immediately connected with us, I wait with some anxiety for the Boy&#x2019;s coming back (by whom I wrote to my Uncle) to know. The great mass of victims are as usual dissipated, ill-fed, above all, terror-stricken people. It has been in none of the villages, in the Annandale side; tho&#x2019; some Dumfries fugitives have died there. Four were in Penpont, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> in Thornhill; none yet in Annan, where I see Waugh has risen from his lurking-hole as Medical-Board man, and publishes as Secretary&#x2019;s Admonition and Advertisement, <pb id="pg-06-250" n="06:250"/>a counsel earnestly conjuring all people to&#x2014;call a Doctor.&#x2014;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> (<date when="1832-10-02">2 Oct.</date>) reports that a note of guidance on dealing with cholera was to be published locally and that this had been done on Dr. Waugh&#x2019;s suggestion.</note> I will add no more till the Boy arrive: he should be here soon, for it is near two o&#x2019;clock.&#x2014; 7 o&#x2019;clock. The Boy returns with good news: none of our kindred there have suffered; the Disease is fast declining, and things assuming their old course.&#x2014; We go to Thornhill tomorrow; then over the moors to Alick&#x2019;s, and Scotsbrig, where I will finish the remainder of this sheet. I think you will like that way better, tho&#x2019; it cost you three days waiting. <closer><salute>And so good night my dear Brother!&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name></p>
<p>Scotsbrig, Monday <date when="1832-10-22">22<hi rend="italic">nd</hi></date>.&#x2014; We left Templand (where Mrs Welsh lies confined to bed by some nervous indisposition these last three weeks), and coming over the heights by Loch Ettrick, AE Bridge and Corncockle Moor, reached Alick&#x2019;s about 4 o&#x2019;clock on the Saturday afternoon,&#x2014;not in the very finest style, for one of our traces broke in ascending Lockerby Hill, and Harry was completely tired of it. We saw the Catlinns Squadron on their Potatoe-field: within doors, however, things wore an unexpected aspect; for Jenny, two days before, had brought&#x2014;a son into the world. Rather quick work, it was thought; for the rest, all well, quite &#x2018;as well as could be expected.&#x2019; Mary was there taking charge of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wochnerin</hi></foreign> [woman in childbed]. Alick gave us a new horse; and so, after tea, we came whirling down hither by Scroggs Brigg, and the heights of Blaweary. Our Mother was out to meet us: all was right; she in good health and heart; with a fire burning in this room (which now does not smoke); Jemmy &#x2018;just expected from the Mill,&#x2019; and every soul delighted to see us. They are in such a bustle with their Potatoe-crop (for which the weather has grown excellent), that I doubt whether I shall get a single signature except my own: however, you are to <hi rend="italic">fancy</hi> all kind things from every one of them, and believe that they are not kinder than reality. They seem to be doing well enough here; in good agreement, diligence, honest prosperity. The crop is all safe, and larger than ever they had; our Mother looks as well as I have seen her do for years; they are struggling on faithfully, not without fair success. Alick came down yesterday, and spent the day with us; his Farm also is said to be answering the end: otherwise he has a considerate, determinate well-doing aspect. Let us be thankful for all mercies!&#x2014; Of country news I have heard nothing; they seem to live very secluded here. The Cholera appears to be very nearly over at Dumfries; the panic here has quite subsided; in this particular circle it never existed. So we will hope all <pb id="pg-06-251" n="06:251"/>things. Every one is more eager than another for new Letters from you. (Turn over)</p>

<salute>My dearest Eliza</salute>
<p>I was in the hurry of packing and preparing for a little journey, when Carlyle told me he was sending a parcel to Sam,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Aitken.</note> if I had any thing to add&#x2014; To be sure I had several things but found myself obliged to wait a more convenient season. I have been on my travels ever since first to Templand, thence to Scotsbrig, back to Templand again, and home the night before last, and now before setting out again I take advantage of this short breathing space to acknowledge your favour and despatch a windfall of pheasants that is come in my way. one [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of which have the kindness to give to Sam with my love. I must be back to Templand this week; for my Mother is ailing, and tho Isabella Macturk is there I am not at all easy in leaving her&#x2014; Her ailment is singular enough&#x2014; She has no sickness, no pain, looks as well as if ever she did in her life, takes her food as usual; only from time to time perhaps twice or thrice in the course of the day (always when she sits up for any length of time) a &#x201C;feeling of sinking&#x201D; comes over her, which, tho it lasts but a few minutes, and never goes the length of complete fainting away, terrifys her to such a degree, that she lies almost constantly in bed. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russel<supplied>[l]</supplied> calls it nervous debility and seems to have no serious apprehension about it. I have a theory of my own about it, and tho not positively alarmed am anxious and uneasy. Indeed I am harassed on all sides at present, for when there I fancy every thing going to wreck at home. the maid to whom I am obliged to com<supplied>[m]</supplied>it my husband and house, cow, hens, &#x26;c &#x26;c being a creature without sense or principle whose depredations are only to be checked by help of blacksmith&#x2019;s fingers.</p>
<p>I liked your description of Miss Frasers house, and am inclined <pb id="pg-06-253" n="06:253"/>to think it would suit, very well.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the Carlyles to live in when they come to Edinburgh to spend the winter.</note> The <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of accom<supplied>[m]</supplied>odation is suitable&#x2014;the rent is suitable&#x2014;and so far as I recollect the situation is suitable&#x2014; I should <hi rend="italic">prefer</hi> an <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> flat provided there was nothing above&#x2014; But your plan is good to ascertain what is to be had, and then for me to see and fix with my own eyes.&#x2014;no&#x2014;see with my own eyes and fix with my own volition&#x2014;(the schoolmaster of Southwick asked an irish man if he could read&#x2014; &#x201C;Yes your honour some little; but not so well as you thank God&#x201D;) The only thing is my weak nervous state of body which makes me boggle at every thing like active exertion&#x2014;indeed I never go a journey from home without bei<supplied>[n]</supplied>g worse for days after&#x2014;but I may be stronger when the time comes&#x2014;about three weeks or so after Marti<supplied>[n]</supplied>mas we calculate.</p>
<p>And now having said the needful, I shall not strive with this worst of pens any longer having to write to my Mother, and make a cheese before bed time.

<salute>Dear Goodykin,</salute>
<p>I hope thou art well again, and wilt come tomorrow soon, and &#x201C;kiss me fairly.&#x201D; No word came yesterday; whence I flatter myself with the inference that things go not ill at Templand. Grandfather&#x2019;s case seems to be much what I supposed: let your Mother take all care of herself, and matters may soon be in their old course,&#x2014;to flow there a while; always, or even long, in this wild &#x201C;Time-element,&#x201D; they cannot so flow.</p>
<p>We have had the quietest life of it here; no incident whatever, not the death of a mouse. The establishment is not on fire, therefore; nevertheless the Coadjutor&#x2019;s return will bring blessings with it. My Mother is and will be nothing but a guest; so too much charge devolves on <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. For the rest we have read immensely, all my odd reading <pb id="pg-06-254" n="06:254"/>is brought up; I have also satisfied myself abundantly with Ecclefechan Biography; in short have been wholly idle. Come then; but first take these following premonitions.</p>
<p>The Black Teapot (<foreign><hi rend="italic">hinc illae lachrymae!</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Hence those tears.&#x201D; Cf. Terence, <hi rend="italic">Andria,</hi> I, i, 126.</note>) has fearfully widened its crack, and now leaks to such intolerable extent, that two days ago I must rummage the house for another, and finding none but the pewter Coffee-pot, have put it upon duty; greatly to my Mother&#x2019;s terror, anxious lest it <hi rend="italic">melt</hi>. Can you get a new <hi rend="italic">pig</hi> [earthenware] one in Thornhill, get it: if not, we manage well enough.</p>
<p>No smell of red Herring have I yet discerned, in spite of my encouragement to profit by the kindess of Providence. The Leddy, on Wednesday morning, must complete her work.</p>
<p>The homebaked Bread will serve till tomorrow; there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> another Loaf, they say, lying untouched: on this side therefore all is safe.</p>
<p>Lastly I am like to be short of <hi rend="italic">Drawers!</hi> Yesterday there was &#x201C;a deficiency in the middle.&#x201D;&#x2014; I bethink me that it will be best to instruct Shankland<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Shankland, Tailor, High St., Thornhill, Dumfriesshire.</note> to make me a pair of effectual flannel ones, till we see farther. He should also make me a black waistcoat? I have sent him an order here to that effect. If you can make any improvement in it, such as buying the cloth yourself, or ordering it otherwise to be bought; or devising any other scheme from the foundation, I, as is my duty, submit: if not, send the <foreign>Slut</foreign> off with the Paper tomorrow morning early, and take no farther thought. He (the <foreign>Slut</foreign>) has also to get me half a hundred of Thorns for mending the Garden hedge.&#x2014; In any case, do not thou go peddling thro&#x2019; mud to Thornhill; let it go any way it likes, rather.</p>
<p>As for the Larder, I learn even now, not without emotion, that a Cock is just slain. The Dumfries mutton remains where it did; all but the flank, which we boiled and consumed, as we mean to do this day with a new section. From these words the Coadjutor&#x2019;s penetrating intellect discerns the whole posture of affairs, more clearly than I myself, who do little more than repeat by rote.</p>
<p>My Mother sends her kindest wishes to yours, and hopes of speedy amendment for all. Let no kind saying on my part be wanting; you know it will hardly be kinder than my feeling thither is. One might grow very pathetic indeed; but that is not the thing wanted for any of us. &#x201C;Stout heart to <foreign>stay brae</foreign> [steep hill]&#x201D;: repeat this to her from me. <hi rend="italic">All</hi> Evil is but unadjusted (unmanufactured) Good.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Pope <hi rend="italic">An Essay on Man,</hi> I, 292.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-255" n="06:255"/>I need not keep scribbling all day, and so may as well close here. Come off in <hi rend="italic">good time;</hi> by <hi rend="italic">no means</hi> later than noon; the Lamps, I see, are still here, besides the chil<supplied>[l]</supplied>ness of the Evening air. You will come to dinner, and take your own place again, where a good fire at least (all that depends on me) shall not be wanting.</p>
<p>O Jeankin this is a sorrowful kind of world; but what can we do with it, except wade thro&#x2019; it in the &#x201C;hold-of-hands&#x201D; way? Bless thee, my little &#x201C;Titian&#x201D;!</p>

<ps><p>M&#x2019;Knight<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The carrier.</note> is not paid: I owed him <hi rend="italic">a penny</hi> for the former week.</p>
<p>A flying report came even into this Parlour on Saturday that Betty was to be proclaimed in Church next day with&#x2014;Wilson the Poacher!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e. banns of marriage proclaimed for Betty Smail (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320821-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1832-08-21">21 Aug.</date></ref>).</note> Whether it took effect I have not learned: our <foreign>Slut</foreign> wanted to go down and hear; but the day proved too rainy. Let never a frail one after this to serve the Devil have fear!</p>
<p>Irving of Gribton<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310818-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1831-08-18">18 Aug. 1831</date></ref>.</note> was twice here; an enormous clatter, but you shall hear.&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nichts mehr</hi></foreign> [Nothing more].</p>
<p>My Mother suggests that she and I can buy the Cloth and Flannel better at Dumfries,&#x2014;whither she is getting rather instant to go. If you think so (as for me I have no knowledge either of Shankland or Thornhill shops), then burn that order, and let that be the way of it.</p>
<p>Send off the Boy <hi rend="italic">tonight</hi> for the Thorns, that there may be no delay about them tomorrow morning: if delay is inevitable, let them lie, and evite it <hi rend="italic">so</hi>.&#x2014; Come soon then.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The melancholy duty devolves on me to inform you<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane&#x2019;s maternal uncle (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201014-JBW-EA-01"><sic>1:281</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1820-10-14">14 Oct. 1820</date></corr></ref>).</note> that your worthy Father<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Welsh (see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230606-JBW-TC-01"><sic>2:368</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1823-06-06">6 June 1823</date></corr></ref>).</note> seems in all human probability to be fast drawing to his end. It is hardly expected that he can be in life when you read this Letter. Such are the sad tidings Mrs Welsh bids me send you.</p>
<p>After her last message, he appeared not to alter, at least not for the worse: on Saturday he had a long sleep; but awoke from it, not strengthened as they had hoped, but feverish and weaker; since which time he has continued to decline. He seems not to suffer much pain, rather weariness and a feeling of confusion; is not unconscious, yet has no harrassing consciousness: the mercy of a mild death is to be anticipated for him. The Doctor has ceased to come; human aid can avail nothing.</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh, as you know, was herself on a sick-bed; but is now the watchfullest and alertest in the house. My Jane came over on Thursday, and today when I expected her return, I was myself sent for. So stands it with us here.&#x2014; May God bless you!</p>

<p>My Husband wrote to you last night according as he was instructed; that my dear Grandfather was so ill that no hope remained, and the end was hourly expected&#x2014; We now regret that we should have been so precipitate in making our fears known to you; lest you should set off immediately and arrive here to witness his continuing struggle, which could now be no satisfaction to him, and only a great sorrow to yourself. I do not know what Carlyle said of your coming; and he <pb id="pg-06-257" n="06:257"/>is not here to night to ask him&#x2014; But in case he did not bid you wait further accounts My Mother thinks it best to write again that you may not be put to greater pain and disconvenience than needful&#x2014; To day and thro&#x2019; the last night my Grandfather contrary to the expectation of all has seemed to recover a little strength&#x2014;is distinctly so far revived that it seems no longer <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> he may remain with us a little longer, which for my Mother<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>s sake above all is much to be prayed for<supplied>[,]</supplied> she is so unfit at present to endure the severe separation&#x2014; Wonderfully has she stood the fatigue of these last days after a confinement to bed for weeks&#x2014; To day she is laid up but it is no return of her complaint only a violent headach<supplied>[e]</supplied> which the want of sleep and anxiety of mind might have brought on a quite healthy person.</p>
<p>Some of us will write tomorrow if there is any change&#x2014;if not the day following&#x2014;and you my dear Uncle will not hasten to set off till you hear.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Father was called away, this day about a quarter before Noon. His Death was of the mildest; about two in the morning, he fell into a slumber; which deepened and deepened, and he awoke no more.</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh behaves herself well. I have, for the present, got her and Jeannie persuaded to retire and seek a little sleep.</p>
<p>Of course you will set out without delay. As I calculate, you will get this on Monday morning, and may be here next day. Perhaps it will be necessary to fix the day of Burial before you arrive: in that case Thursday or this day week may seem the fittest. But as yet there has been no consulting.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>A packet goes off for London tomorrow; in which a sheet for you is not to be forgotten. Your long Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1832-10-22">22 Oct.</date> In Mineka, XII, 125&#x2013;30.</note> which I found at Dumfries, one week after date (for the frank had been too late) stands admonishing me. You are now my main Voice from that Babel; and I would not have you many days silent,&#x2014;any day were it possible.</p>
<p>The Parcel which brings you this is the <hi rend="italic">Diderot</hi> mentioned last time: the able Editor seems to have established himself in your neighbourhood (Kensington),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Cochrane in his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1832-10-29">29 Oct.</date> gives his new address as No. 39 Edwardes Square, Kensington.</note> and is therefrom minded to illustrate Foreign Literature with more vigour than ever, and do business in the great Mother of Dead Dogs:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320110-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref></note> heaven give him all success! For my own share, I find him a well-meaning, rather thick-headed, rude-bred mortal, who if you hold him tight does well enough; a sign he is of the Times; to me there where he sits and works almost a prodigy. His last Number is here; but I have read none of it, except the Essay which you said was Buller&#x2019;s,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1832-10-22">22 Oct.</date> (Mineka, p. 130) Mill had said that Buller had written &#x201C;on the reign of Louis 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">FQR</hi>; but, in fact, the article was not published until <date when="1833-01-00">Jan.</date> The piece Carlyle thought Buller&#x2019;s was presumably a review-article on B. Sarrans, <hi rend="italic">Lafayette et La Revolution de <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date></hi> (Paris, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), X (<date when="1832-10-00">Oct. 1832</date>), 514&#x2013;40. Buller&#x2019;s review-article, XI (<date when="1833-01-00">Jan. 1833</date>), 89&#x2013;127, was to be on C. Lacratelle, <hi rend="italic">Histoire de France depuis la Restauration</hi> (Paris, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">30</date>), and &#x201C;un Homme d&#x2019;Etat,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la Restauration, et des Causes qui ont amen&#xE9; la chute de la branche ain&#xE9;e des Bourbons</hi> (Paris, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">32</date>).</note> a rational, considerate sort of piece, wherein however as you well know the main mystery of the matter is never looked in the face. I am sorry to hear of poor Charles&#x2019;s health, and still more of his inapplication: a kindly, genial nature; clear, productive, with a rare union of decision and benignity; it is a thousand pities he should waste himself: yet nothing can be surer in this world of ours, than that he who will not struggle cannot conquer. Alas, it is a most tough obstructed wild-weltering world; wherein the stoutest swimmer is often carried far from his aim. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ernst ist das Leben</hi></foreign>;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the Prologue to Schiller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein:</hi><lb/><lb/>

<p>As for myself I have written nothing since you heard of me. I drove with my lady over into Annandale, by wild Lakes and water-courses, villages and farm-&#x2018;towns&#x2019; (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Zaune,</hi></foreign> enclosures), all still, grave-looking, almost sad; a moving text for a wild moving homily, such as I perhaps too often preach to myself. Do but know that the word <foreign><hi rend="italic">ae</hi></foreign> means <hi rend="italic">river</hi> in the Anglo-Saxon speech; and find here a &#x2018;Water of AE&#x2019; (by whose banks too your progenitors were born),<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There is no reason to suppose this: Mill&#x2019;s father (born James Milne) came from Northwater Bridge, Angus and Kincardine, on the banks of the North Esk.</note>&#x2014;the rushing of its stream carries you back into ancient Ages, into the &#x2018;great and famous Nations of the Dead&#x2019;; and all Existence, with its Death-Life, and never-resting, all-bearing, all-devouring <hi rend="small-caps">Time</hi>, seems no other than verily a Prophetic <hi rend="italic">Dream</hi>.&#x2014; On the whole, wish it or not, this wondrous World in its most natural aspects gets more and more of a supernatural character for me: that I now hold this pen is perhaps intrinsically as <hi rend="italic">miraculous</hi> as if I should make the Sun.

<p>We returned home; but new distractions arose; some of them mournful enough. Of this sort was the Death-sickness and finally last week the Death of my Wife&#x2019;s Grandfather: we had both to go over, not for his sake only, but for his Daughter&#x2019;s, our Mother, who herself needed support. On Friday, I saw the old man depart peaceably&#x2014;forever; always a sad and grandly stern sight, were it never so anticipated. Next Friday, he is to be laid in his grave; and so for him after four-score years the world is ended. He was a peculiar old man: <foreign><hi rend="italic">impiger, iracundus, inexorabilis, acer,</hi></foreign><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Impatient, passionate, ruthless, fierce. From Horace, <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica,</hi> 1. 121.</note> or as we have it in Scotch, &#x2018;as <foreign>het</foreign> [hot] as ginger, and as <foreign>stieve</foreign> [obstinate] as steel.&#x2019;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Waverley,</hi> II, chap. xxxv, where Scott attributes the couplet, &#x201C;A fiery etter-cap, a fractious chiel, / As het as ginger and as stieve as steel,&#x201D; to a translation by &#x201C;Struan Robertson.&#x201D; The lines have not been traced in the works of Alexander Robertson of Struan.</note> When one thinks how <hi rend="italic">many</hi> men have lived, and have died, what is one man, what is this one man that asks the question!</p>

Intellectually speaking, you perceive, I have done almost nothing; not even read. For a day or two I occupied myself with the Life of one <hi rend="italic">Thomasius,</hi> a German of the <date>17th century</date>; of whom probably you have never or hardly heard; nor is it great pity: he is but a sort of German Toland, only weaker: the Biographer, one Luden,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Thomasius (<date when="1655-00-00">1655</date>&#x2013;<date when="1728-00-00">1728</date>), German jurist and philosopher; John Toland (<date when="1670-00-00">1670</date>&#x2013;<date when="1722-00-00">1722</date>), deist and controversialist, author of <hi rend="italic">Christianity Not Mysterious</hi> (<date when="1696-00-00">1696</date>) and other works; for Heinrich Luden, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300320-TC-JPE-01">TC to JPE, <date when="1830-03-20">20 March 1830</date></ref>.</note> has since become notable as Historian of the (old) Germans; but was then in his spiritual nonage. A far richer subject that I happened, very incidentally to resume, was the History of our Church of Scotland. I know not if ever you inquired much into that matter: but I think it is one you would find well worth knowing. The materials are abundant, and easily accessible; your Father can doubtless point you out the whole path.

It is not ten years since I, an enlightened sceptic, first deigned to look in them; but my reward was great: they are in fact most notable Books. My present guides were of a far inferior sort, M&#x2019;Crie (with some <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>), and on Cruikshank, and [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] old Calvinistic Dissenter with a <hi rend="italic">History</hi>.

The practices of Power against Revolt, in that remarkable Revolution (of which <date when="1688-00-00">1688</date> was but the falling of the curtain) are notable in another way,&#x2014;namely a scientific and poetic. A true Scotchman can weep warm tears over these brave men (among the last true men of this Island), and execrates with a divino-diabolic indignation (immeasurable either way) the scandalous Debauchee, to whom in virtue of Plush and Parchment, and the name of King, such power over them was committed.&#x2014;I really think I could like well to write a most immortal Book (in small octavo) on that matter. But, alas, there are no Books to be written now, unless you have an independent money capital,&#x2014;which unluckily is not my case at present; and luckily perhaps, for who knows? I should add, in farther excuse of this zeal, that my good Wife is a Cameronian by birth; a lineal descendant of John Knox himself; and of two John Welshes (for the later of whom I am proud to observe always a <hi rend="italic">double</hi> rogue-money is offered<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Rogue money&#x201D; was a popular name for a tax levied in counties and burghs for the expenses of arrests and detentions of criminals, authorized by Act of Parliament in <date when="1725-00-00">1725</date>, abolished <date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>.

<p>I enclose you here a small Note for Leigh Hunt.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321120-TC-JHLH-01">TC to <sic>LH</sic><corr>JHLH</corr>, <date when="1832-11-20">20 Nov.</date></ref></note> If you like to make use of it as a note of introduction, send your card up with it; and it will serve for that end, for you are mentioned within. But my chief aim was to know that the little memento reached its destination, for I have sent one already, and got no tidings of it; and Hunt, worthy man, is of those unfortunate people whose <hi rend="italic">address</hi> is often <hi rend="italic">changing</hi>. Will you therefore ascertain (Moxon<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Moxon (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>), publisher and poet.</note> the Bookseller in Bond-Street, Bulwer, and many others can say) what Hunt&#x2019;s actual address is; and then either deliver this, or (correcting it if needful) send it by the Postman. You will find Hunt a most kindly, lively, clear-hearted creature, greatly to be sympathized with, to be honoured in many things and loved; with whom you will find no difficulty to get on the right footing, and act as the case will direct. Hunt is a special kind of man, a representative of London Art, and what it can do and bring forth at this Epoch; what was too contemptuously called the &#x2018;Cockney School,&#x2019; for it is a sort of half-way-house to something better; and will one day be worth noting in British Literary History: Under this view too <hi rend="italic">Hazzlitt</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] is markworthy; his <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> Biographer, as you say, does not get to the bottom of him, being indeed himself apparently still involved in the same element. That Telford however must be a rather vigorous person:<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Noon Talfourd (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), barrister, journalist, and author, friend of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Godwin, etc.; serjeant, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>; judge, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>.

Every man that means <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> deserves that you should hear his meaning, and understand it. But on the whole, few Englishmen can make the smallest attempt at writing Biography: they are a poor mode-ridden and otherwise hag-ridden people; hunting after Respectability, in perpetual terror of missing it; and so write, as they do all other things, in a state of partial paralysis. Poor Hazzlitt [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], I fear, will pass away without Biography.</p>
<p>This is a longer Letter than you ever wrote me: however, it too must end. You will write soon again. We do not go to Edinburgh for a mont<supplied>[h]</supplied> or so; what our address there will be is not yet known: we are for a small <supplied>[furnish]</supplied>ed house somewhere in the fieldward part of the Town, and will take a servant <supplied>[and]</supplied> many <foreign>etceteras</foreign> with us. Messrs Bell &#x26; Bradfute Booksellers Bankstreet will always know our whereabout. But you shall hear from me before then yourself. It is I chiefly, and not my Helpmate, I think, who form the moving power in this little Enterprize: she seems in secret to prefer the wilderness,&#x2014;where if you saw our Stack of Peat and Coal fuel, you might fall dumb with astonishment. But what are the warmest fires; what is the securest whinstone stronghold?

Radicalism enough I can utter for myself, whenever I open my mouth; enough and to spare.</p>
<p>From the Lady Austin we still hear nothing; but give Falk the blame.&#x2014; I shall be very glad to know Fox and all your friends that will let me, when I see London again.

<salute>My Dear Badams,</salute>
<p>Many a long month has passed since we left you: the visit to Craigenputtoch has not been paid, to my knowledge; not the smallest message comes from you. I do not even know your address, or I had made inquiry (with my own pen) long ago. Once by some such opportunity as this, I charged Holcroft with wishes and questions for you; Brother Tom, being a trustworthy punctual man, would no doubt do his duty.</p>
<p>Send me your address at any rate. Write, were it a Letter no longer than this, to let me know how it stands with you, what you are doing, what thinking and enduring. Alas, in this world, &#x2018;each has his <foreign>wierd [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to dree</foreign>.&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial, an idea recurrent in Old English poetry: &#x201C;Each has his destiny to endure.&#x201D; Cf. the &#x201C;weird sisters&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>.</note> My Dear Badams; would it were now in my power to repay what you of old did for me!

<p>Brother John has been in Naples all summer; is now (I suppose) in Rome for the winter. We hear from him pretty regularly: he makes frequent inquiries about you; to which, as you see, I can make no answer.</p>
<p>We are for Edinburgh this winter; are about hiring some small furnished house there; so, in some five weeks hence, you may figure on the verge of the Meadows, somewhere about George-Square yonder. A Letter directed hither will at any time find us out: but indeed Holcroft always has our address, for we get a weekly Newspaper from him.</p>
<p>My Wife is not here this week, or she would beg to be kindly remember<supplied>[ed to yo]</supplied>u and yours. She is greatly improved in health since the Fogs were so far behind us; she still complains a little, but seems to be improving and like to improve.</p>
<p>I have but a few moments left; and another Note to write. Do not forget me. Speak to me. Why will you keep silence.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I sent you a little Note,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> by some conveyance I had, several months ago; whether it ever came to hand is unknown here. We learned soon afterwards, from a notice in the New Monthly Magazine, that you were again suffering in health.</p>
<p>If that Note reached you, let this be the second, if it did not then let this be the first little Messenger arriving from the Mountains to inquire for you, to bring assurance that you are lovingly remembered here, that nothing befalling you can be indifferent to us.</p>
<p>Being somewhat uncertain about the Number of your House, I send this under cover to a Friend who will punctually see that it reaches its address. If he deliver it in person, as is not impossible, you will find him worth welcoming: he is John Mill, eldest son of India Mill; and, I may say, one of the best, clearest-headed and clearest-hearted young men now living in London.</p>
<p>We sometimes fancy we observe you in <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s</hi> and other Periodicals. Have the charity some time soon to send to a token of your being and well-being. We often speak of you here, and are very obstinate in remembering.</p>
<p>I still wish much you would write Hazlitt&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>. Somewhat of History lay in that too luckless man; and you, of all I can think of, have the organ for discerning it and delineating it.</p>
<p>As for myself I am doing little. The Literary element is one of the most confused to live in, at all times; the Bibliopolic condition of this time renders it a perfect chaos. One must write &#x2018;Articles&#x2019;; write and curse (as Ancient Pistol ate his leek<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Henry V,</hi> V, i.</note>); what can one do?</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-266" n="06:266"/>My wife is not with me today; otherwise she would surely beg to be remembered. You will offer my best wishes to Mrs Hunt, to Miss, and the little grey-eyed Philosopher who listened to us.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Vincent (ca. <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>), who later helped his father in writing and in other ways.</note></p>
<p>I asked you to come hither and see us, when you wanted to rusticate a month. Is that forever impossible?</p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Two Letters of yours<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Castellamare, <date when="1832-08-31">31 Aug.</date>; and from Rome, <date when="1832-11-04">4 Nov.</date></note> are now in my hand unanswered, so that I must delay no moment to get out of debt: had there been an opportunity sooner than Wednesday, I would have seized it. My Letter, of about a month since, must before now have reached you: it was sent off from Ecclefechan, and contained direct accounts of Annandale matters, even autographs from some of the people there. On our return hither, two days afterwards, a Letter from Castellamare was awaiting us; Scotsbrig Jane had come too, and I read it to both the Janes, while Tea was getting ready. After that, tho&#x2019; I was not without mind to write, a succession of confused impediments came in the way, whereby this is properly the first opportunity I had so that, without specially intending it, the Letter-and-answer plan for this time at least comes in action. You shall hear how we have been situated.&#x2014; Mrs Welsh, I told you last time, was not well. We had driven over the Moors out of Annandale and seen her as we passed, apparently in rather a better state. But scarcely had <hi rend="italic">sister</hi> Jane after a week got conveyed home again, and our Mother got up hither, on pressing invitation, to see us, when a Letter came from Templand with intelligence that poor old Grandfather was much worse, and Mrs Welsh throwing by all her own ailments had started up to watch over him; whereupon my Jane thought it right to set off without delay, and so left my Mother and me by ourselves here. It is needless to fill your sheet with long accounts of comings and goings, of agitations, sorrowing, <pb id="pg-06-267" n="06:267"/>and confusions: enough to inform you that the old man now lies no more on a sickbed, but in his last home beside his loved ones in the Churchyard of Crawford, where we laid him on Friday gone a week. He had the gentlest death, and had numbered four score years: fond remembrances and a mild long-anticipated sorrow attended him. Man issues from Eternity; walks in a &#x201C;Time-Element&#x201D; encompassed by Eternity and again in Eternity disappears. Fearful and wonderful! This only we know, that God is above it, that God made it, and rules it for <hi rend="italic">good</hi>.&#x2014; What change of life this may produce for Mrs Welsh we have not understood yet: most probably, she will retain the house at Templand, and give up the ground and farming establishment; such at least were her wisest plan. But Jane and I hastened off, on the Saturday, to relieve my Mother who was watching here in total loneliness, agitated too with change of servants and so forth, for it was the Martinmas term. We left John Welsh of Liverpool at Templand with his two sons and a friend, and have since heard nothing; we are apprehensive our next news may be that she is again fallen sick. Hereby, my dear Brother, you may see that I could not well write: indeed, it was only three days ago that I could so much as ascertain whether your money remittance had come.&#x2014; For the rest, receive thankfully the assurance that all continues well. The Cholera, of which I wrote to you, is gone, taking about 500 souls with it, which from a population of 13,000 was, in the space of some four weeks, rather an alarming proportion. The terror of the adjacent people, which was excessive, and indeed disgraceful, has scarcely yet subsided. Happily the Pest did not spread; a few cases occurred in the Galloway villages; elsewhere none, or hardly any: and so it went its way, as mysteriously as it had come. You remember Mary Connell (or Paterson) the little busy creature who kept a bit shop in Ecclefechan: she had removed to Dumfries as washerwoman and was the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> person seized, the first also that died. Nobody connected much with us has been taken, many as were exposed. Death, however, in other shapes is as of old busy: James Thomson of Cleughside<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified, but certainly not the James Thomson of Annan mentioned in <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190531-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:179</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1819-05-31">31 May 1819</date></corr></ref>.</note> is gone lately; Clow&#x2019;s wife of Land was buried last week. Old Wull Nay too is dead; his poor old Wife bitterly lamented (they said), and &#x201C;hung by the hearse,&#x201D;&#x2014;which for all her loud weeping could not stay. A son of Davie Corrie&#x2019;s, married about a year ago, is also dead: what is this whole Earth but a kind of Golgotha, a scene of Death-Life, where inexorable <hi rend="small-caps">Time</hi> is producing all and devouring all? Happily there is a <hi rend="small-caps">Heaven</hi> round it; otherwise, <pb id="pg-06-268" n="06:268"/>for me, it were not inhabitable. Courage! Courage! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Uns zu verewigen sind wir ja da</hi></foreign> [We are here to immortalize ourselves].</p>
<p>On the day after we returned from Templand, Jamie came from Scotsbrig; expected the day before, and <hi rend="italic">without</hi> Alick, who had proved too busy to come. On Wednesday morning I got our Mother mounted in the gig, and rolled off with her: it was the &#x2018;Martinmas Wednesday,&#x2019; and all was confusion at Dumfries; however I got your Letter (of the <date when="1832-11-04">fourth Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date> at Rome) lying there; called also at the Bank, and found &#xa3;135 ready, for which I took a Bank-receipt that shall be ready for you on your home-coming. I do not need the money at present, and you will need it; therefore much as I rejoice in the spirit you display let it <foreign><hi rend="italic">dabey bleiben</hi></foreign> [lie aside], till we see how times turn. You may by possibility become a monied man, I never; the relation between us, in any case, is already settled.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written on <date when="1832-08-31">31 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Respecting your journey to Edinburgh &#x26; the measures you purpose to take there respecting the publication of your book I shall long to hear the rest. Of Teufelsdreck in its present shape I read enough to know that it cannot fall to the ground, but contains Truth which must tell sometime or other. Only one thing I have to say that it will ultimately make no difference whether you publish it anonymously or not. Every one will know you to be author &#x26; you will take your stand accordingly. For my own part I should like better to see you putting your name to it at once &#x26; satisfied that you could do so without any hesitation. It treats of the most important of subjects &#x26; deserves all consideration before any step is taken with it that is irretrievable. For the rest I hold that there is something like inspiration in such matters, &#x26; no man can direct another; a man feels what he must say himself better than anybody can tell him.&#x2014; There need not be any difficulty for want of money if you see meet to publish at your own expense. At the end of <date when="1832-09-00">September</date>, I shall be able to remit you one hundred &#x26; forty or fifty pounds.&#x2014; When I spoke of this matter in one of my last letters it was not with the idea that you should &#x2018;borrow&#x2019; from me. I wanted only to pay a part of my debts. You gave me hard-earned money which I cannot help repaying as soon as it comes to be in my power. I beg you will make no objections; I will borrow from you again if it becomes necessary, but I must insist on paying whenever it can be done without inconvenience.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; To save time, we made no loitering in Dumfries, but were off by 3 o&#x2019;clock; Jamie too, the cattle being unbuyable for dearness, overtook us (mounted on Macadam) about Collinn; and thus we jogged along over the heights, and (lighting our lamps at Notman&#x2019;s smithy, for I love to be minute) came home very prettily a little after six. Alick came down two hours after, being bound for Annan to seek slate for some sheds he is now busy with. All was well there too; a rough puddle of a place as yet, but wherein there is industry exerting itself, and a sort of rough plenty. He is to be here and see us more at large in some ten days, I have sent him our Boy over to help with the slating, and stay with him thro&#x2019; winter if it <pb id="pg-06-269" n="06:269"/>prove of any use. Alick is grown more collected, has lost none of his energy, nor on occasion his biting satire, which however his wife is happily too thick skinned to feel. They will struggle on, I think, and not be defeated. Jamie too goes along satisfactorily, a shrewd sort of fellow; with much gaiety, who sometimes in his laughter-loving moods reminds me slightly of you. No two of the house have such a heart&#x2019;s relish for the ludicrous, tho&#x2019; we all like it. Mary and her husband behave very decently: it is determined, on all sides, that they are to have some new habitation next Whitsunday, tho&#x2019; in what sort is not yet apparent; a small farm would please them best, but such are very difficult to be met with worth the price: the competition for &#x201C;free labour&#x201D; (this is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that lies in that way of life) is so strong. Our good Mother is in tolerable health and heart: she improved much with us here, the first two weeks, but fell off again for want of exercise and excitement. I am to send her down a (forgotten) bag of Trefoil with a long Letter next Wednesday. She read here about the Persecutions of the Scotch Church, and in some of Knox&#x2019;s writings I had; not even disdaining Fraser&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Magazine</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Reviews:</hi> she is still very zealous, and predicts black times (with me) for the world. It seemed to her that Lady Clare would be much amazed with your descriptions of Scotch Life, and might learn much from it. From Almacks<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Balls given at Almack&#x2019;s, a suite of assembly rooms in King&#x2019;s St., St. James&#x2019;s Sq., London, were in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries often presided over by ladies of highest rank.</note> to Ecclefechan is a wide interval; yet strange things come together. Strictly considered the wretched Ecclefechan existence is the more tolerable of the two, for in it there is a preordination of Destiny, and something <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, namely muslin woven, and savage bipeds boarded and bedded. Alas, the hand of the Devil lies heavy on all men. But days quite saturated with <hi rend="italic">Antigigmanism</hi> are surely coming, and from these better will arise. The completest profoundest of all past and present Antigigmen was Jesus Christ. Let us think of this, for much follows from it.</p>
<p>Coming now home to Craigenputtoch, I have little to report that can be called news; happily however no bad news. We are once more alone in the wilderness, which the wild-howling winter (whom meanwhile we defy with peat and pit-coal) has rendered ugly enough. Jane is not yet by any means what she was; far better, however, than while in London, and still I think recovering. <hi rend="italic">When</hi> she specially purposes to write your Letter I do not learn; can say only that she did and does purpose it, but is busied about many things. I have got <pb id="pg-06-270" n="06:270"/>nothing brought to paper since I wrote last; scarcely anything in any shape done. I fell very accidentally on some Histories and Memoirs about the Scotch Church as hinted; and have that chiefly in my head at present. I could like to try if an excellent little Book might not be written on the matter, were it not that all Bookwriting is for the present in a state of Chaos. My common saying is that Bookselling is on its deathbed; and day after day confirms me. John Murray, for example, I hear yesterday, is &#x201C;under Curators&#x201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Administrators &#x201C;of another person&#x2019;s affairs &#x2026; appointed by court&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Scottish National Dictionary</hi>), presumably because of impending bankruptcy.</note> Colburn and Bentley have parted company (this is <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> certain); none of them have one sixpence to rub on another, but are working (in Wull Brown&#x2019;s phrase) &#x201C;altogether upon float,&#x201D; by puffery and other sharpery; to which also the Public is now opening its eyes. One day, if I live, you shall see my <hi rend="italic">Essay on Authors</hi>, whom I look upon as the most stupendous characters of this age. <hi rend="italic">They</hi> are truly the Church; and peace will never be till they are recognised as such and sanctioned and solemnly obligated to the functions thereof,&#x2014;say this time two hundred years; in waiting for which all tithe-questions and such like must be poor and trivial, and no Church Reform but only a Church New-creation can be of any avail. Let those look to it whom it concerns. For <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and those that follow me, nothing but toil, scarcity, dispiritment, isolation, is in any case appointed, and by God&#x2019;s grace also perhaps the heart to bear it and subdue it. When I have the vision of all the <hi rend="italic">Gig</hi>-fragments in Creation flying never so precipitately into the Nether Firepool, and a world left Gigless (and Gigmanless) what can I do but at most cry: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Canny! Canny!</hi></foreign> [Careful! Careful!] Thither were they all, from the first invention of them, appointed; a <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> journey is all one can wish them. For the rest, politics, especially Radical Politics are an especial weariness to me: Tait<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>s radical Magazine I call a <hi rend="italic">sand</hi> Magazine, as Fraser&#x2019;s is a <hi rend="italic">mud</hi> one, whereof the latter is the less afflicting to me. Tait I certainly consider will decease, tho&#x2019; his puffing is manful; the leanest, cankerdest of magazines; written, you would say, by creatures that had all got the <hi rend="italic">mange</hi> and were suffering under hunger. Destroy! Destroy! that is their whole song; thus do they journey on thro&#x2019; Sahara Desarts to a Land&#x2014;of vacuity. Such is the general tone of journalistic opinion, or such is it fast becoming, in this Island: alas, this too was necessary, and we must endure it. Better times are coming, surely coming; cast <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> thy bread on the wild agitated waters, thou wilt find it after many days.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccl. 11:1.</note> That is enough.&#x2014; <pb id="pg-06-271" n="06:271"/>I have sent off the <hi rend="italic">Diderot</hi> piece to Cochrane, and expect the Proof-sheets of it soon. I should try next whether I could not write a little piece for Fraser,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fraser had written on <date when="1832-11-08">8 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I therefore beg of you not to forget that Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine still exists &#x26; that the publisher will be happy to receive anything you will send &#x26; to give it his earliest attention&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> who is very earnest in soliciting, and the best of payers, before we go to Edinburgh. But we are bound thither about the end of this month, and there will be little time for writing: however, we must try. As to our Address in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I can yet specify nothing farther. Another Letter, we hope will still find us here, our address to will be left at the Dumfries Post-Office: however, when you write <hi rend="italic">after</hi> receiving this (if you have no farther light), direct to the &#x201C;care of J. Bradfute Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 22 George Square.&#x201D; On my side I will write immediately after we arrive, before, if there be anything to say; so fancy us <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, while you hear nothing. If the Letters take three weeks in coming, as the last did, we must resume the old method, I fear: it shall be as you wish.&#x2014; At Edinburgh, I expect Books, some conversation with reasonable earnest, or even with unreasonable baseless, men; on the whole, some guidance economical if not spiritual. Sir W. Hamilton is one I hope to get a little good of; of others too whom hitherto I have not personally known. Of my own acceptance with all manner of persons I have reason to speak with all thankfulness, indeed with astonishment. It is little man can do for man; but of that little I am nowise destitute<supplied>[.]</supplied> In any case, we will live in our hired house, on our own earned money; and see what the world can show us. I get more earnest, graver not unhappier every day: the whole Creation seems more and more Divine to me, the Natural more and more Supernatural. Out of Goethe, who is my near neighbour, so to speak, there is no writing that <hi rend="italic">speaks</hi> to me (<foreign><hi rend="italic">mir anspricht</hi></foreign> [pleases me]) like the Hebrew Scriptures, tho&#x2019; they lie far remote. Earnestness of Soul was never shown as there. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ernst ist das Leben</hi></foreign> [Life is serious]; and ever to the last, soul resembles soul.&#x2014; Here, however, speaking of Goethe, I must tell you that last week, as our Mother and I were passing Sandywell, a little parcel was handed in, which proved to be from Eckermann at Weimar. It made me glad and sad. There was a medal in it, struck by Bovy<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. F. Antoine Bovy (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>), medallist and sculptor born in Switzerland, naturalized French.</note> since the Poet&#x2019;s death: Ottilie had sent it me. Then a gilt cream-coloured Essay on Goethe&#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">Practischen Wirksamkeit</hi></foreign> [practical effectiveness] by one F. von M&#xfc;ller, a Weimar <foreign>Kunstfreund</foreign> [patron of the fine arts] and intimate <pb id="pg-06-272" n="06:272"/>of deceased&#x2019;s, with an inscription on it by him.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eckermann&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1832-10-20">20 Oct.</date> refers to Chancellor Theodor Adam Heinrich Friedrich von M&#xfc;ller (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), politician and lawyer. He is spoken of as a friend of Goethe, the executor of his will, and one who in writing upon Goethe was able to command sources of information not available to others. See Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, pp. 330&#x2013;31, 335&#x2013;42. In Sarah Austin&#x2019;s translation <hi rend="italic">Characteristics of Goethe</hi> (London, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>), III, 62, M&#xfc;ller is spoken of as Goethe&#x2019;s friend and &#x201C;the mediator between him and society.&#x201D; Mrs. Austin includes a translation of M&#xfc;ller&#x2019;s essay or speech in her second volume, pp. 241&#x2013;320, &#x201C;Goethe Considered as a Man of Action.&#x201D; The first volume also has the reminiscences of Johann Falk which Carlyle refers to later in this letter.</note> Finally the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Heft</hi></foreign> [Issue] of the 6<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Vol. of <hi rend="italic">Kunst und Alterthum</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Art and Antiquity</hi>], which had partly been in preparation, and now posthumously produced itself; to me a touching kind of sight. Eckermann wrote a very kind Letter, explaining how busy he was with <hi rend="italic">redacting</hi> the 15 voll. of <hi rend="italic">Nachgelassenen Schriften</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Posthumous Writings</hi>]; the titles of all which he gave me. There is a vol of <hi rend="italic">Dichtung u. Wahrheit</hi>, and the completion of <hi rend="italic">Faust:</hi> these are the most remarkable. I have read M&#xfc;ller&#x2019;s Essay; which is sensible enough; several good things also are in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Heft;</hi></foreign> towards the last page of which I came upon these words (by M&#xfc;ller speaking of Goethe): <foreign><hi rend="italic">Unter den j&#xfc;ngern Britten ziehen Bulwer</hi> (?) <hi rend="italic">und Carlyle ihn ganz vorz&#xfc;glich an, und das sch&#xF6;ne reine Naturell des letztern, seine ruhige, zertsinnige</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <hi rend="italic">Auffassungsgabe steigern Goethe&#x2019;s Anerkennung bis zur liebevollster Zuneigung</hi></foreign>.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Among the younger Englishmen, he [Goethe] is particularly attracted by Bulwer and Carlyle. The beautiful, pure nature of the latter, with his calm delicate power of perception, raises Goethe&#x2019;s recognition of him to the warmest affection.&#x201D; See also Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, p. 334 n. 1.</note> This of <foreign><hi rend="italic">liebevollste</hi> <supplied>[Z]</supplied><hi rend="italic">uneigung</hi></foreign> [warmest affection] was extremely precious to me: alas, <foreign><hi rend="italic">and das alles ist hin</hi></foreign> [and all this is gone];&#x2014; Ottilie promises to write, but I think, <hi rend="italic">not</hi>.</p>
<p>And now, dear Jack, before closing, let us cast a glance towards Rome. Your two late Letters are very descriptive of your household ways, and give us all much satisfaction. We can figure you far better than before. Continue to send the like. I wish you were <hi rend="italic">well</hi> settled for the winter; there seems nothing else to be wished at present. I can understand your relation to your patient to be a delicate one; but you appear to have good insight into it, and to be of the most promising temper: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Geradheit, Urtheil und vertr&#xE4;glichkeit</hi></foreign>[uprightness, judgment and good temper], I miss none of these three; they make in all cases a noble mixture. Be of good cheer, <foreign><hi rend="italic">in omne paratus</hi></foreign> [prepared for everything]. You will return home to us a much more productive kind of character than you went; learned, equipped in <hi rend="italic">many</hi> ways, with all <pb id="pg-06-273" n="06:273"/>that is worthy in your character developed into action, or much nearer developement.

No answer yet; from Badams such hardly expected. Mill writes very diligently, is almost my only channel of news. He reports of Glen, &#x201C;Little or no alteration.&#x201D; It is in an element of Radicalism that Mill lives; but he is struggling hard to get out of it: a pure well-intentioned, tolerant wonderfully open soul.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>A long Letter was what I fully intended to write you on this occasion; but just as we were about finishing an early Tea, to get the decks cleared in good time, what should enter but W. Corson and the stupid Schoolmaster you saw here,&#x2014;at the wrong season, as it ever is! They have sat and <foreign><hi rend="italic">jannered</hi></foreign> [talked foolishly] for near three mortal hours, and have left me so reduced as you see. The will must pass with you for the deed.</p>
<p>The showers on Friday, if any fell at Scotsbrig would do you far more ill than me: I reached Dumfries in the most prosperous manner, little after one o&#x2019;clock; going by the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> road, and running up the ascents. At the Hoddom Mains obstacle, I found Sharp<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Almost certainly General Matthew Sharpe, former landlord of the Carlyles, with whom there had been altercations.</note> and a whole nation of red-coated hunters hounds and whippers-in; but urged poor Harry thro&#x2019; the midst of them turning not aside: a silly-looking <pb id="pg-06-275" n="06:275"/><foreign>lassie</foreign> standing by the post, exclaimed in a mournful supplicatory tone, &#x201C;Peaa towl&#x201D; [&#x201C;Pay toll&#x201D;]; to which prayer however I turned an altogether deaf ear, and never paused for it.</p>
<p>At Dumfries, to my regret, I found the shops all shut; it was their Sacramental Fastday.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A day spent in fasting, with probably at least one preparatory service before the sacrament of Holy Communion, when, though a weekday, the shops were shut.</note> Shaw however was at home, in secret; I got your Trefoil Bag from him; went and talked a little at M&#x2019;Diarmid&#x2019;s; and then departed between two and three. It was a very good afternoon, and I got hither perfectly well between five and six. Jane was well and waiting for me.</p>
<p>The Apothecaries&#x2019; Hall being shut, I could get no rhubarb; but Macadam&#x2019;s Wife is charged to get you a little tomorrow, and slip it into the Bag, where by good searching you will find it. The Clogs [wooden-soled shoes] are there, which you already know how to manage. If the <foreign><hi rend="italic">cawkers</hi></foreign> [iron plates] are not judged worth knocking on again, another very <hi rend="italic">light</hi> set can be got. There is a pair of old London shoes, too large for me; perhaps they may serve James Austin to the Kirk on a dry day; I have meant to bring them down before now, but forgotten. Jane said, of Mary and her present, that &#x201C;she (the Presenter) would give her <hi rend="italic">skin</hi> off her to any one she had regard for.&#x201D; I would advise her, not.</p>
<p>Now with regard to the coming back of these Clogs, all is already settled, we have nothing more to say. Of course Jane (and Jamie) will send me some bit of word; the smallest will be welcome. I may add too that I think if you have any opportunity, it were good to set Bob Bell on making me a pair of Drawers: his <hi rend="italic">best</hi> kind (and with cotton in them, if he can); we shall see what sort they are of. There is some speech here about the Irongray<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irongray is about 4 miles NW of Dumfries.</note> man; but I think the outlook that way seems distant: at the worst we may wait till the Edinburgh hosiery shops are open for us, where tolerable stuff I understand is to be had.</p>
<p>As to the Edinburgh journey, it seems fixed that we are to bend thither about the end of this month: Jane has got four weeks of House-<hi rend="italic">Aliment</hi> (weekly allowance) and fancies that will do. We must wait for Alick&#x2019;s coming, before anything is schemed out finally. You shall hear from me again first, if not see me (which however the weather does not encourage); and thro&#x2019; winter, I promise if power is left me, to be a most regular correspondent. I am really very glad we <pb id="pg-06-276" n="06:276"/>had so much of you here; it is many long years since we had such <foreign><hi rend="italic">craiking</hi></foreign> [chatting] together: let us hope too another good time is coming. In spring weather it is all far cheerfuller; I too may be less bilious, and so better company. In any case, dear Mother, let us ever feel ourselves as united under the All-seeing Al<supplied>[l-loving]</supplied> Eye; divided or not in the body, <hi rend="italic">there</hi> we may be together; nay Death itself cannot divide us there.&#x2014; I have written a long Letter to John, and told him all about you. I am not yet writing anything else. I send my kindest regards to them all, not forgetting my little <foreign><hi rend="italic">cracking</hi></foreign> [talkative] Jennie,&#x2014;whom Jane here calls &#x201C;an <foreign>unken&#x2019;d</foreign> [unknown] woman.&#x201D; A few words I must write to Jamie, and then be done.&#x2014; Take care of these cold winter frosts and thaws; and keep yo<supplied>[urself we]</supplied>ll for us, Dear Mother. And so <closer><salute>God keep you all!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I wrote to Alick by the Boy M&#x2019;Whir, and must now send you a few words, on the same subject; a very few, for the cause explained in my Mother&#x2019;s Letter.</p>
<p>The thing I have to say is about our Father&#x2019;s Tombstone: I fully purposed to speak of it, and settle the matter finally, but, not having seen you that night, must now do it by writing. Pray let it be set about without any delay.</p>
<p>The first thing to be done will be to get some respectable Mason, who is used to such things and can work them and judge of them: perhaps R. Brown<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >R. Brown, mason, Port St., Annan. Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220429-TC-JAC-01"><sic>2:100</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1822-04-29">29 April 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note> or some of his people will be the best, but you know better than I. Now if this Mason on examining the Stone already there, thinks that by hewing it downwards to the very end, and fixing it (in a secure manner) in some sort of <hi rend="italic">pediment</hi>, or under, sunk [<hi rend="italic">sic:</hi> under-sunk] stone (such as I have seen) two feet or so of more length could be gained, then I decidedly think it were our best plan to do <hi rend="italic">so</hi>, and let the present inscription stand as it is. But if this on <pb id="pg-06-277" n="06:277"/>trial and examination will not do, then (as seemed to be agreed among us) there will be nothing for it, but to take off the old inscription, and put it on in less room;&#x2014; using, or not using, the help of a <hi rend="italic">pediment</hi> stone, as may seem convenient.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For an illustration of the grave, see J. M. Sloan, <hi rend="italic">The Carlyle Country</hi> (London, <date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>), p. 86. Carlyle explains to his brother that if the old gravestone is placed on a pediment there will be room not only for his father&#x2019;s inscription but also in time for his mother&#x2019;s, even though the stone already recorded the deaths of James Carlyle&#x2019;s first wife (Janet) and those of Carlyle&#x2019;s sisters Janet and Margaret. The old stone was kept and is still to be seen. It records the date of James Carlyle&#x2019;s birth as <date when="1758-08-00">Aug. 1758</date>. Carlyle records in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> entry for <date when="1832-10-24">24 October</date> a visit he paid to his father&#x2019;s grave: &#x201C;On the Wednesday Evening I was at my Father&#x2019;s grave: had gone with Jamie to fix the inscription. It was the last light of dusk. Gloomy Empire of <hi rend="small-caps">Time</hi>! How all had changed, changed; nothing stood still but some old Tombstones with their cross-bones, which I remembered from boyhood. Their strange <foreign><hi rend="italic">s&#xfc;ss-schauerliche</hi></foreign> affect<supplied>[?]</supplied> on me. Our House where we had once all <hi rend="italic">lived</hi> was within stone cast; but this too knew us no more again at all forever.&#x2014;&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>I will send you what new inscription shall be wanted, in good time<supplied>[.]</supplied> The exact date of our Father&#x2019;s birth will require to be sent me. It is on some Bible, I think; otherwise our Aunt Fanny can give it.</p>
<p>The thing to be attended to is to <hi rend="italic">stir in the matter without loss of time</hi>. Alick &#x26; you can consult; but as you are near the spot, the execution will mainly depend upon you.&#x2014;&#x2014; I add no more on this subject; knowing that more is not necessary to be added.</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Before Alick come up you will probably have seen him, and among other things, can give us some deliverance about that cart-<foreign><hi rend="italic">rake</hi></foreign> [journey with a cart] to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and whether it is desirable or not. We here are unable to decide; seeing at but only one side of the matter.</p>
<p>I have done now dear Jamie; and they are waiting for me, to pack up their bags. I will send you and all the rest my best blessings. &#x201C;Take heed unto thyself and thy goings.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Deut. 4:14&#x2013;15.</note> Love one another; fear God, and have no other fear.</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I will add here another very humble <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> advice; But I add it <hi rend="italic">very seriously:</hi> It is to get that kitchen vent cleared of smoke, at this very time! Pate Easton&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Easton: cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210324-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:347</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-03-24">24 March 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> plan seemed quite reasonable; he undertakes it for a pound; why, this is not two shillings a winter for the time you have to abide there! Now, my dear Brother, I am quite serious in what I say here. The first part of my Letter related to the honour of the Dead; but this very decidedly concerns the comfort of<pb id="pg-06-278" n="06:278"/>the Living,&#x2014; not your own comfort, but that of some you value <hi rend="italic">more</hi>&#x2014; And so enough! enough<supplied>[!]</supplied> <closer><salute>Excuse me, listen to me, love me!</salute></closer></p>

<place>Craigenputtoch</place> / Tuesday night [<date when="1832-12-04">4 December 1832</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My dear Eliza</salute>
<p>We returned from Templand last week; our presence there being no longer needful; but rather disconvenient every bed being occupied with newcomers, and the sofa to boot,&#x2014; Want of consideration in the male half of the creation is no novelty; so one need not wonder at these individual men: but it is a pity that my Mother should have her hands full of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> sort of occupation, when it were so much better for her that she were folding them to sleep. Mercifully there has been no return of her nervous disorder; but she is bilious and weak, and likely to be worse, when the excit<supplied>[e]</supplied>ment from so many causes ceases to act on her. My Uncle and Alick spoke of leaving a day or two ago&#x2014; Walter and a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Grieve from Glasgow<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane refers to her mother&#x2019;s brother, John Welsh of Liverpool, and his two sons, Alick and Walter. Mr. Grieve is possibly connected with Jemmy Grieve of <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310811-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1831-08-11">11 Aug., 1831</date></ref>.</note> (a recent acquaintance whom I saw on this occasion for the first time with small emotion of thankfulness) were expected to go sooner: but as neither my Mother nor Isabella MacTurk (who also is still there) wrote on Wednesday according to promise, to tell us when we should return; I conclude them to be all still there; and till I hear to the contrary I shall mind my affairs at home, which a three weeks absence, and a change of Servants in the interim had brought into extreme disorder. The Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> project has of course been lying quite dormant in the midst of all this distress and serious business&#x2014; It is only within the last two days we are returned to the consideration of it. Carlyle thinks we should remove about the time when the Christmas dinners are eaten and done. Will you write and tell me what success has attended your house-hunting? whether Miss Frasers be still vacant&#x2014;how soon one could enter after fixing? As my experience of furnished houses is very slight, <pb id="pg-06-279" n="06:279"/>it would also throw considerable light on my packing operations if you would give me a sort of abridged history of the goods and chattels!&#x2014;(not of each individual house but the likeliest among them) For instance should I need to bring bed &#x26; table linen&#x2014;spoons &#x26;c? Have you remarked any pressing dearth in the crokery [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] line? Knives and forks&#x2014;table covers and such like items were easily transported&#x2014; Is there any thing on the mantle piece? that is a leading question silly as it may look&#x2014;for the answer will give me a sort of notion of the character of the whole appartment I have often seen meagre cold looking places that a warm table-cover&#x2014;a box or two&#x2014;a few trifles tastefully arranged could in a few seconds at almost no cost make plenished and home looking&#x2014;</p>
<p>Would to Heaven the little flitting [moving] were well over &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">At my time of life and with my cough, going up to Jerusalem</hi>&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane seems to be modifying a phrase of Carlyle&#x2019;s father. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270619-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:233</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-06-19">19 June 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> is an enterprise of weight and danger.</p>
<p>My Mother will surely come to us in the course of the winter, and resume her old connexions; I have not made the proposal yet&#x2014;one I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> make&#x2014;to come hither for a week or two&#x2014;being violently waved aside, in a way w<supplied>[hich]</supplied> showed me, she should have leisure left her to collect herself, before any proposed change would meet a favourable hearing&#x2014; Her plans are unknown to me and I believe uncertain to herself&#x2014; It seems likely she will give up the farm, retaining the House the garden and a park [field]&#x2014;for she has <hi rend="italic">gained</hi> nothing by farming hitherto except annoyance&#x2014; A House of her own she should always have somewhere&#x2014;however little she may occupy it&#x2014;and as well there as elsewhere&#x2014;<hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> live here very comfortably, keeping one maid a boy two horses and a cow on considerably less money than her yearly income&#x2014;and Templand is a cheaper place for living than this being nearer all necessary things&#x2014; But my Uncle will probably get some arrangement set on foot before he leaves. Her present affliction is likely to be severely felt&#x2014;and just for the very reason that will make it seem to others comparitively light&#x2014;the long period of confin<supplied>[e]</supplied>ment fatigue and anxiety by which it was preceeded&#x2014; She now feels that dreariest of all feelings&#x2014;that her occupation is gone<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Othello,</hi> III, iii.</note>&#x2014;that her last evident duty in the world <hi rend="small-caps">has been</hi> <hi rend="italic">fu</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">l</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">filled</hi>&#x2014; But so long as one lives new duties show themselves and by and by she will find something to exercise her unwearied activity, and feelings of kindness&#x2014; In the mean time God help her and all of us</p>
<p>You received a letter from me with the birds? in which I expressed <pb id="pg-06-280" n="06:280"/>my predilection for Miss Frasers house&#x2014; If not you will hardly see the propriety of the present&#x2014; <supplied>[God]</supplied> bless you dear  My love to Brady in which my Husband joins&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Eliza</salute>
<p>Owing to the singularity of our relation with the Postoffice, as with all the other institutions of active life; your letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> only reached me last night&#x2014;nearly a whole week after date&#x2014; I am certainly greatly indebted by the trouble you have, and are so readily taking about us; and have also reason to commend the punctuality and distinctness of your communications&#x2014; It is a grand and I am sorry to say a rare quality in a female letter to carry its meaning on its face. so much so indeed that one thinks oneself fortunate to find any meaning at all, after the most puzzling study. But you tell a plain story always, from which one is at no loss to deduce a plain conclusion&#x2014;and this however <pb id="pg-06-281" n="06:281"/>meanly you esteem yourself as a correspondent makes you to me always an agreeable one&#x2014;</p>
<p>They say a weak person generally gives <hi rend="italic">three</hi> reasons where one is all that is required. Accordingly I have three reason<supplied>[s]</supplied> for being sorry we have missed the Graeme Street House.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Graham St., about half a mile west of George Square, then still close to green fields.</note> I think the Climate there, healthier than in the New town. I was pleased with the prospect of being so near to George Square, and finally I have of late weeks been living there in <hi rend="italic">idea</hi> and got used to the place as if I had been there in the body&#x2014; However&#x2014;delays are dangerous&#x2014;and now there is nothing to be done but to thank our stars that so feasable a looking substitu<supplied>[t]</supplied>e is cast up; and to put off no time in securing <hi rend="italic">it</hi>. I think in all but situation the Widows house seems most suitable&#x2014; And <hi rend="italic">if you can get it at the rent you speak of 4 &#xa3;</hi> I beg you will come to a final arrangement with her without delay. I cannot at this moment fix a <hi rend="italic">day</hi> for entering but you may say some day of the first week after newyears day. Nothing better could be accomplished by my coming in beforehand&#x2014;and really the notion of going ten miles, without my Husband, is frightful to me, I am so very <foreign><hi rend="italic">feckless</hi></foreign> [helpless] grown&#x2014; The best plan is for you as I have said to take this tenement and&#x2014;&#x2014;take possession! the day we are to come&#x2014;with my old Betty<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Betty Braid, her old Haddington maid.</note> if you know where to find her or any other <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> woman that could put on a fire and have a kettle boiling on it. I mean to bring a little black maid<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To do menial work, not a Negro.</note> along with me&#x2014;who will sort [put in order] the beds for us in no time&#x2014;and next day when we have all our luggage out of the way we will wil<supplied>[lingly]</supplied> go home with you to dine with Br<supplied>[adie]</supplied> if he be willing&#x2014; You would need to order in a temporary supply of coals&#x2014;and leave all the rest to my forecasting spirit&#x2014; The Lady if she know her own interest should not hesitate to let her house to <hi rend="italic">such</hi> tenants&#x2014;even at a reduced rent for I am sure more careful people&#x2014;more free of children and nuisances of all sorts are not easy to be fallen in with.</p>
<p>I came hither last Sunday and found my Mother alone and not worse than when I left her&#x2014; But she is still delicate&#x2014;and suffering exceedingly from the cold weather&#x2014; I think she will come to us before long&#x2014;but the <hi rend="italic">air</hi> of Stockbridge<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The rented house was 18 Carlton St., in Stockbridge, which is a suburb to the north of the New Town, in the valley of the Water of Leith.

She hopes to hear from you soon and sends her kind love as also does my <pb id="pg-06-282" n="06:282"/>Husband.

<salute>My Dear Miss Stoddart,</salute>
<p>Jane wrote you a very long Letter; but I find on inquiry that two of the most important items are forgotten. My Brother told her long ago that Forgetfulness was stealing over her; that a general &#x201C;breaking up of the faculties&#x201D; had become visible.</p>
<p>The two things forgotten are: first that at Craigenputtoch we have only <hi rend="italic">one post day in the week;</hi> the day that corresponds to your Tuesday afternoon: a Letter sent from you (I think, before 5 o&#x2019;clock) reaches us next night in that way; if missed then, it must lie, in all human probability, for another week.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters from Edinburgh would go via Dumfries to Dunscore, daily; but, except on a Wednesday, they would remain there for collection.</note> Let this therefore be a word to the wise. The second thing I had to remind you of, &#x201C;dearly beloved,&#x201D; as we of the Pulpit say,&#x2014;is that you must in no wise forget to give us the precise address of the House in your <hi rend="italic">next</hi> Letter; so that we may be able to write carrier directions, post-office directions, and so forth, without loss of time.</p>
<p>If anything <hi rend="italic">else</hi> is forgotten, do you by natural sagacity, find it out and accomplish it! Could you want any wider commission?</p>
<p>We are here till Monday;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He is writing on Saturday.</note> Mrs Welsh appeared too weak today for leaving. She will not consent to accompany us to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; but I think will join us there. What new arrangements are to be made at <pb id="pg-06-283" n="06:283"/>Templand does not yet altogether appear: there is time enough for considering.</p>
<p>Now let us find you at your post, well and giving welcome;&#x2014;and so be a glad meeting appointed for us all!</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Your Parcel has come into our hands, quite safe; and only a few hours ago. It was forgotten, or not delivered in time, the first Wednesday; and then the next, as you will probably have heard ere now, we were at Templand; whence we did not return till two o&#x2019;clock today. We were to have come off on Saturday; but Mrs Welsh was so poorly, that morning, we did not like to leave her; thus we could not travel till Monday, which proved so bad a day that the inside of &#x201C;built walls&#x201D; seemed the only fit place for us. We rolled off, however, this morning; and got home well enough, tho&#x2019;, as you would say, with our noses tolerably &#x201C;set up.&#x201D; I have several things to do; among others a Letter to write to London; so you must take shorter allowance than I would otherwise gladly have given.</p>
<p>The Clogs seem most sufficiently done; the Drawers also are massy substantial-looking things, and will be highly welcome in the frosts I have to expect. But to express the joy that was felt at sight of the <hi rend="italic">kipper</hi> is a task my Pen declines; no language just now at my command could do justice to it. A vision of friendly B<supplied>[r]</supplied>eakfasts in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> rises before the female eye, which almost like Isaac Fletcher&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isaac Fletcher was the nail-maker of Ecclefechan.</note> &#x201C;<foreign>glents</foreign> [flashes] fire&#x201D;; and guests are pressed to eat this savoury fish, and rejoice over it, let it kill them with indigestion afterwards or not. Seriously, Jane thinks it a very excellent piece of goods, and thanks you very heartily for it.</p>
<p>I suppose Alick has been at Scotsbrig before now, and has told you how he came upon us at Templand on Wednesday, and how he and I <pb id="pg-06-284" n="06:284"/>went down to Dumfries together on Friday. We expected to be back at our several lodgings again about the same hour: I was there with tolerable light, little after five o&#x2019;clock, and found all as I had left it. The Dumfries people, our Uncle John among the number, were crowding the streets with Election favours in their lapells [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], and busy deciding between Sharpe and Hannay:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >General Matthew Sharpe and David Hannay. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310327-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-03-27">27 March 1831</date></ref>. According to the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, Sharpe defeated Hannay by 488 to 370. Both were reformers. Sharpe was the brother of Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), antiquary, artist, and friend of Sir Walter Scott.</note> two sorrier individuals few men could be called to make choice between. They settled it doubtless, on Saturday; but how, we have not yet heard, and indeed have never taken the trouble to ask, or even guess. I said long ago, &#x201C;If the Reform Bill do nothing better for us than send up 658 General-Sharpes to heal the bruises of this diseased maltreated community, I think we might as well have staid where we were.&#x201D; However, let us be patient: better men it is to be hoped will come into the market;&#x2014;otherwise, indeed we may give up the game.</p>
<p>Since I left you I have done nothing but read; at Templand I could not even get much read: we staid there far longer than I expected. I have not &#x201C;put pen to paper&#x201D; at all, and begin to feel very discontented. The truth is, it is always Sorrow and Pain that gives me any Insight into things: if I were always joyful I should continue always as ignorant as I am. If I <supplied>[have]</supplied> luck thro&#x2019; winter, there must be something put down; if not something &#x201C;<foreign>grend</foreign>,&#x201D; then something mean, at all rates if possible something true.</p>
<p>I had a kind of cold for some days; got by clipping my hair too close; which I did (front and hindhead) with <hi rend="italic">my own hand</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Echoing Irving&#x2019;s often-quoted phrase.</note> The cold went away again; the hair too is now grown longer. I am sorry to see in Jean&#x2019;s Letterkin, what indeed I heard from Alick, that you too had caught an ailment of that kind: Alick said, you were a little better; but I fear you do not take sufficient care, and that the thing may be still hanging about you, as colds are wont. This is the nastiest season of the year; do, my dear Mother, keep yourself away from exposure; be careful of your well-being, as of a thing that is the most precious to us all. Has Jamie got Pate Easton to that kitchen yet? Tell him I would almost come down, and act as architect myself. Colds must abound among you till that vent is cured. For you, dear Mother, do not sit down there at all; have a fire up stairs, or in the end room, and keep the warmest side of it, till the Sun come back.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-285" n="06:285"/>Our journey to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is getting more precise: we expect a Letter tomorrow, which may finally settle the House we are to have, and the day we are to set out on. The first week of the newyear [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] is the time we aim at: that is to say, to be setting off about this day fortnight. The precise day we do not yet know. Tell Alick that we settled with M&#x2019;Kaig the Thornhill Carrier, who tho&#x2019; 2 pence a stone dearer is so much more convenient; will come and seek the things (at Templand) and also deliver them without porterage; moreover, carries one stone at the same rate as many. Will some of your hands, therefore, get the two Butter-Pigs ready, and the Catlinns Ham, and send them by Notman directed &#x201C;Mrs Welsh Thornhill, by Andrew Watson Carrier,&#x201D; next Wednesday? How the Butter-Pigs should be packed I know not very well; unless one were to put a bit of Board on to <hi rend="italic">overlap</hi> each end of the Pig, and then fix the two there with ropes and straw-ropes? Jamie will be able to judge better. Put &#x201C;this end up&#x201D; on the address, and &#x201C;with care.&#x201D; The things will all have to be sorted again, at Templand.&#x2014;&#x2014; My dear Mother, my sheet is about done; and yet I had many things more to say. I am not writing in the style of Farewell; for I have still some kind of speculation about coming down to see you before we go. I would most readily come; but the weather is so wild, and my horse so weak: I know not well what to bid you think. I have still <hi rend="italic">Knox&#x2019;s History</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321119-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1832-11-19">19 Nov.</date></ref></note> to read out; and a variety of little things to set in order. Therefore be not sure of me. Yet I think if the weather turn anyway steady, and I get thro&#x2019; with matters here, I will try to jog over; perhaps it may be in the beginning of next week, perhaps on this Saturday, I cannot tell till after Wednesday. And so we will leave it there; and I will say good night for the present time, still in hope of a better. I have been thinking of you almost incessantly of late; and often with a most unthankful sadness of heart. Are we not ever in <hi rend="italic">God&#x2019;s</hi> hand, who made us, and will have mercy on us? Be of good cheer, my dear Mother, for all shall work together for good.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>My Dear Eliza,</salute>
<p>Your very punctual and distinct Communication has just come to hand; and the whole <foreign><hi rend="italic">burble</hi></foreign> [tangle] into which the jolly Widow&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to Mrs. Colquhoun, their future landlady.</note> peculiar quality of brain has thrown you becomes manifest. Jane seems so thunderstruck and overawed in glancing into the profundities of that matter (wherein she can see no bottom), that I, at her most earnest request, have undertaken to reply to you,&#x2014;as Edward Irving says, &#x201C;with my own hand.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Two words, it may be hoped, after all will bring us fairly thro&#x2019;. The first word is that we <hi rend="italic">intend</hi> to stay some three months, and shall of course need a house for that time. Take No 18 for us then, if the woman will engage to let it (and not again to change her mind) on the following principle: That if during the first fortnight we give her warning that the place does not suit, we are to pay her the Six Pounds for one month; and that if no such warning is given, the rent is to be Four Pounds per month all the way, or Twelve Pounds for Twelve <pb id="pg-06-287" n="06:287"/>weeks. If she do not like these terms, wish her good morning, and let her find a tenant elsewhere.</p>
<p>The second word is that as Mrs Colquho<supplied>[u]</supplied>n appears to be (I grieve to say) a Lady of very peculiar habits of doing business, it will be needful for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to be doubly and trebly accurate, and see with your own eyes that all minor arrangements (such as that of &#x201C;getting things&#x201D;&#x2014;which I do not well understand) be placed on such a footing that even a Goose cannot mistake them. &#x201C;Folly to Folly,&#x201D; saith the Proverb, &#x201C;makes nothing but Melancholy.&#x201D; The proper way is Wisdom to Folly.&#x2014; As to <hi rend="italic">Beds</hi>, I hear <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi> say that she can do without feather-beds, if all the rest be right; and that as to the &#x201C;getting of things,&#x201D; her expectations are by no means high.</p>
<p>Now this is the answer. I grieve very much for all the trouble you are getting; but you are well known as a most friendly being; and to the heart of sensibility that feels for others&#x2019; woes,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Pope, &#x201C;The Universal Prayer,&#x201D; l. 37, the poem of which Carlyle wrote in <date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>: &#x201C;No prayer, I find, can be more appropriate still to express one&#x2019;s feelings, ideas, and wishes in the highest direction&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, IV, 371).</note> all these things are light and but the luxury of doing good.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220323-TC-WG-01"><sic>2:68</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1822-03-23">23 March 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I add only that if this negociation take effect, you are likely to have the inexpressible pleasure of seeing us, on the evening of Monday (I think, the <date when="1833-01-07">7<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of January</date>) by the Thornhill Coach; and that we shall hope to hear from you, in any case, this day week.</p>
<p>We left Mrs Welsh tolerably well yesterday (the day before having proved a tempest), and came hear [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to eat a Christmas Dinner, which differed in no visible particular from any other of the year.</p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We shall ere long begin to feel some of the disquietude about Post matters, which has hitherto fallen exclusively to your share. It is now <pb id="pg-06-288" n="06:288"/>six weeks all but a day since we last saw your hand; a longer interval than usual; yet still not so long as to justify uneasiness, more especially considering my own slack performance of late: so, tho&#x2019; you have now two Letters of mine to answer for, we will keep cheery, hoping the best, and in the meanwhile send you <hi rend="italic">our</hi> news (receiving yours or not) while we have opportunity. Well am I assured that whether the Post travel or not, nay whether you write or not, thinking of us, loving us, is a duty you no day fail to discharge: I will also beg you to believe the like of us for your own behoof; and support these irregularities this wide separation with patience: if God will, we shall not always be so far separate. Good days are coming!</p>
<p>It was but last night that we got our household transported hither, by the Thornhill Coach; and as neither Jane nor I slept much, Jane not at all (thanks to the Watchman&#x2019;s care about the <hi rend="italic">hour</hi>), I am not in very bright spirits at present: however, I have a vacant forty minutes, and will <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> to do a duty, which is always one&#x2019;s best resource. I have yet seen but little of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> beyond a few of the Cloth-making shop-keeping sort: I am to go and dine with old Uncle Bradfute (at a <hi rend="italic">precise</hi> moment); will therefore reserve all Edinburgh things till the end of my Letter, which will not be accomplished till tomorrow.&#x2014; I have been <hi rend="italic">once</hi> at Scotsbrig since I wrote you (if not twice, for I am dim about my last date); I set off exactly this day gone a week, thro&#x2019; a world of frost-mist and snow-<hi rend="italic">slush</hi> being almost superstitiously determined to see my Mother once more before we went. She was sitting at tea (in the low end-room), and stood silent with amazement to see me there all swimming with <foreign><hi rend="italic">slobber</hi></foreign> [slush] (for she had despaired of me two days before); but soon got me stript of travelling gear, and otherwise lovingly attended to; and then we sat talking the whole night; for the rest of them were all gone to Brand&#x2019;s of Craighouse<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270101-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:177</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-01-01">1 Jan. 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> to a Newyear&#x2019;s Party. She looks older, our dear Mother, within these two years; yet her health is still wonderfully tolerable: her spirits, as we can all understand, have been much weighed down, so that her <hi rend="italic">old</hi> cheerfulness is gone, perhaps for long; nevertheless the faith she has sustains her from despondency, and the love we all endeavour to show her is most lovingly responded to. She depends much on me, as the eldest; and I feel it as a sacred duty to divide my last fraction of earthly substance or faculty in her cause. One of her very first questions is always: &#x201C;Hast thou heard anything fra the Doctor?&#x201D; She speculates greatly about your home-coming; and says if it be the Almighty&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-06-289" n="06:289"/>good pleasure she shall yet live to meet you. A Letter from you to herself, not so much filled with expressions of feeling, as with minute details about your way of life, purposes, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Befinden und Hoffen</hi></foreign> [condition and hopes] would gratify her much. She often speaks of you with more joy perhaps, not with more love than formerly; and now and then makes us laugh by some such phrase as &#x201C;when the Doctor was <hi rend="italic">sucking!</hi>&#x201D; The rest were all in their usual heart; Alick (hopping a little with a sprained ancle nearly mended) able to pay his rent, and looking forward with resolution enough, confidence enough. We had a long hithering and thithering on the Wednesday night (for Alick had come down) getting everything <hi rend="italic">finally</hi> settled up and course committed to paper between them; I acted as accountant and succeeded without difficulty in making everything <hi rend="italic">straight</hi>. Next morning Jamie accompanied me up to Puttoch, then over to Templand; and having seen us once on the Coach, he was to take back the Gig, lock it in its House, leave the key with Peter Austin, and then on Harry ride his ways home to Scotsbrig (one of Peter&#x2019;s sons talked, he said, of accompanying him); and perhaps about this very hour, he may be&#x2014;the length of Repentance.&#x2014; Here however I must pause for Bradfute&#x2019;s minute is come! <foreign>Adieu</foreign><supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p><date when="1833-01-09">9<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> Wednesday morning.&#x2014; Dear John, I again give you the top of the morning such as it is. I went along to B&#x2019;s, took my dinner there, and returning about nine o&#x2019;clock found the street illuminated with a lanthorn, and our old friend the &#x201C;Porter from Thornhill&#x201D; busy disloading our 64 stones of luggage, which was all in right order. This and what followed from it occupied the rest of the night. By way of avoiding the watchman my Goody and I retired to the back bedroom; had like however to have made a bad exchange; for the people above about the very same date seemed to have assembled a party of jolly companions who sat laughing drinking and singing to the Cithern till two in the morning, unconscious or careless that two other beings of like passions with themselves were silently or in words cursing every twang of the melody, and desiring nothing more than to have one tier of Napoleon&#x2019;s Pont-Neuf Artillery<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to &#x201C;The Whiff of Grapeshot&#x201D; (see Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution, Works</hi>, IV, 314&#x2013;20) given in defence of the Convention, <date when="1795-10-04">4 Oct. 1795</date>.</note> wherewith to blow them all swiftly into infinite space, and so go to sleep. However, it ended, as all things do; and we fared better than expectation. Poor Jane has got her sleep, and now in consequence her headache: tomorrow we can hope she will be up and better. This is not properly a noisy place but the reverse; in a little while we shall learn the train of things, to endure <pb id="pg-06-290" n="06:290"/>or to avoid, and so do well enough. It is an excellent Floor of its sort; two really dashing Rooms, with three Bedrooms, Kitchen and all <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>, for &#xa3;4 a month. We have engaged it for 3 months, that is till the beginning of <date when="1833-04-00">April</date>. You remember Stockbridge, and a smart street, with large trees growing thro&#x2019; the pavement, looking into the river (water of Leith), called <hi rend="italic">Dean Street?</hi> You just cross the Bridge from Edinburgh, and Dean Street stretches to the <hi rend="italic">left</hi>. Now Carlton Street is the first street at right angles to that; our house is the corner one (the corner <hi rend="italic">farthest</hi> from the River), and fronts two ways; both beautiful, one of them into a sort of circus or double-crescent, where are such trees that a rookery has established itself in them. So much for our Whereabout, which I know you will take pleasure in figuring. The question: what we expect or intend here? is also not very ill to answer. I expect little; to see some Books, some People; to <hi rend="italic">live</hi> for twelve weeks, with eyes and ears open; and wait <foreign><hi rend="italic">das Weitere</hi></foreign> [further developments]. In some days too I shall have my writing desk in order, and compose somewhat; were it only to pay expenses. I have long been very remiss in the matter of writing; indeed have not had so long an interval of reading and idling for above twelve months. But my head is not vacant; neither has that past time been wholly barren,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; nearly enough so. I know not what I shall write first; perhaps something for Fraser (who pays best, and is the sweetest to deal with); but you shall hear. Naso I saw yesterday walking along the streets, but kept clear of him&#x2014;for a day or two. He has but one fault but that one is a thumper: he seems very scarce of money! He only paid that Paper <hi rend="italic">Characteristics</hi>, after twice being dunned, some three weeks ago, and then rather sparingly I thought. Another Paper<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Corn-Law Rhymes,&#x201D; published in <date when="1832-07-00">July 1832</date>.</note> he still owes me; but will and must pay it. Cochrane is keeping the <hi rend="italic">Diderot</hi> I conjecture for his <hi rend="italic">next</hi> Number; that will be some four months hence.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, XI (<date when="1833-04-00">April 1833</date>), 261&#x2013;315.</note> That is all of my Scriptory Economics I had to tell you. By Heaven&#x2019;s grace, I nowise want merchants (of a sort) for my ware; and can still, even in these days, live. So long as that is granted what more is there to ask. All Gigmanity is of the Devil devilish: let us rather be thankful if we are shut out even from the temptation thereto. It is not want of money or money&#x2019;s worth that I could ever complain of; nay often too it seems to me as if I did <hi rend="italic">best</hi> when no <hi rend="italic">praise</hi> was given me; and I stood alone between the two Eternities, with my feet on the rock: but what I mourn over is the <pb id="pg-06-291" n="06:291"/>too frequent obscuration of Faith within me; the kind of exile I must live in from all class of articulate-speaking men; the dimness that reigns over all my <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> spheres, the &#x26;c &#x26;c for there is no end to man&#x2019;s complaining. One thing I have as good as ascertained that Craigenputtoch cannot forever be my place of abode, that it is, at present, and actually, one of the worst abodes for me in the whole wide world. One day I will quit it; either quietly, or like a <foreign><hi rend="italic">muirbreak</hi></foreign> [a heavy fall of rain on moorland]&#x2014;for I feel well there are things in me to be told which may cause the ears that hear them to tingle! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Alles mit Mass und Regel</hi></foreign> [All with measure and rule, i.e., all with restraint]! As yet I decide on nothing; will nowise desert the whinstone stronghold till I better see some road from it. I could live again in Edinburgh; perhaps still more willingly in London, had I means; my good Wife is ready for all things: so we wait what the days bring forth. Perhaps <hi rend="italic">your</hi> place and mode of settlement might do something to determine us: we shall see how it turns. Meanwhile clear enough it is that <hi rend="italic">I</hi>, in these very present days, ought to&#x2014;write some thing true for the Periodicals!</p>
<p>I said I had no Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> news: I have yet seen only the houses and pavements. The whole place impresses me as something village-like; after the roaring Life-floods of London, it looks all little, secluded, almost quiescent. But again it is very <hi rend="italic">clean</hi>, and orderly in comparison; on the whole a desirable place. One thing village-like is the number of known faces I have met on the streets; all old friends, grown a little greyer in the whiskers. I encountered Brewster yesterday, in a-canvassing for the Natural Philosophy Professorship, vacant by the death of Leslie. There seems great doubt whether he will get it. The Tory Town-Council driven desperate and distracted by the figure of the time are bent, as their last act, to make a signal job of this; and put in a certain Forbes, age about 23, never till this moment heard of by any man.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir David Brewster did not get the chair, which went to James David Forbes (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">68</date>), Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh at 19 and of the Royal Society (London) in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>; he was to be famous as a glacialist, and was to succeed Brewster in <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date> as Principal of St. Andrews.</note> This seems to be the main article of Bookshop gossip for the time. The elections are over: Jeffrey and one Abercromby<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Abercromby (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), 1st Baron Dunfermline, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>; eminent lawyer, Whig politician, MP since <date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>; judge-advocate-general, <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>; a reformer who had worked for a Police Bill for Edinburgh in <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>, and for reformed representation for the city in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date> and <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>.</note> (a liberal Whig) defeated the Tory wholly, and were chaired with great glory and renown. Jeffrey does not know yet that we are here; otherwise <pb id="pg-06-292" n="06:292"/>he would be thro&#x2019;, for it is but a stone-cast. They had an election contest at Dumfries too; a monstrous looking joiner&#x2019;s shed which they called a hustings stood erected at the west end of the mid-steeple, and there the people were perorating, one day when I happened to be down. Sharpe prevailed over Hannay;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320831-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-08-31">31 Aug. 1832</date></ref>.</note> pot over kettle: a shallower mortal never travelled so far in such a trade. But so it must be: they that took <hi rend="italic">such as they had</hi> never wanted. Buller is returned for Liskeard. The Whigs prevail everywhere: only some five or six <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> Radicals, among whom Cobbet<supplied>[t]</supplied> for Oldham. The Tories may drink hemlock when they please, for they are extin<supplied>[ct]</supplied> not to be reillumed. As for me, I take no hand in it, speak no word in it, whatsoever; for the whole struggle is poor and small; in <hi rend="italic">thought</hi>, I am the deepest radical alive in this island, but allow it to rest there, having ot<supplied>[her]</supplied> to do. There will be infinite floods of contentious jargon emitted were the poor men got together; and so they will &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Carry</hi> on till Loansdeal coom,&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Old Cumberland woman, listening as the newspaper was read, full of battling, warring, and tumult all over the world, exclaimed at last: &#x2018;Aye, they&#x2019;ll karry on till Lonsdale coom, and he&#x2019;ll soon settle them aw!&#x2019;&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, I, 91), James Lowther (<date when="1736-00-00">1736</date>&#x2013;<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>) and William Lowther (<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>), both Earls of Lonsdale, exercised a great influence over politics in northern England, William Lowther was also the patron of Wordsworth.</note> and then&#x2014;. I suppose you see <hi rend="italic">the Times</hi> still, and know all these things as well as I.</p>
<p>Let me not forget to mention here a Letter I got for you at the Dumfries Post-Office that day of the Hustings. It lay there directed: &#x201C;Doctor Carlysle, Dumfries&#x201D; with a postmark &#x201C;Suisse par Belfort;&#x201D; I paid for it, on trust that it was either for you or me, and opening it found, in <foreign><hi rend="italic">frakturschrift</hi></foreign> [German type], a &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Hochzuverehrender Herr Doktor</hi></foreign> [Highly esteemed doctor]!&#x201D; and then a long-winded apologetical declaration that an individual slightly acquainted with you was very desirous that you should procure him some sort of handsome Tutorship in the British dominions, if coupled with travelling so much the better. He was very anxious &#x26;c &#x26;c; then so and so qualified; furnished indeed with a Professorship at <hi rend="italic">Aarau</hi> (in Switzerland, near Berne),<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aarau, 50 miles NE of Berne.</note> but the appointments were so <foreign><hi rend="italic">gering</hi></foreign> [inconsiderable], they could not support one in the proper figure; finally he signed himself &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">C. E. J. H&#xE4;ring</hi>&#x201D; Aarau in der Schweitz <date when="1832-12-05">5 Dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1832</date>. The <hi rend="italic">only</hi> article even like news was that a Dr Becherer (so I read it, with whom Herring seems once to have met you as well as at Eichthal&#x2019;s) had died a few months ago at Munich. You had better perhaps write <pb id="pg-06-293" n="06:293"/>poor Herring a word of answer from Rome; the date itself will tell him all.</p>
<p>We see by the Newspapers that lady Clare and Mr Burrel are still at Rome, at least were lately: you must tell me all your movements and intentions. Your difficulties and disquietudes hide from me no less; such I know you have, for you are on this Earth: <foreign><hi rend="italic">ubi homines sunt injuriae sunt</hi></foreign> [where there are men there are injuries].<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Here Wilhelm, on entering, found a large clean apartment; except for benches and tables, altogether empty. So much the more was he surprised to see a large tablet inserted above one of the doors, with these words marked on it in golden letters, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ubi homines sunt modi sunt;</hi></foreign> which in modern tongue may signify, that where men combine in society, the way and manner in which they like to be and to continue together is directly established.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi>, Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 338.

I say we should be thankful for such a possession; and try to draw from it what good it will yield, taking deliberately precaution against the evil. Perhaps the Future will be kinder to us both: but is not the Present kind, full of work to do? Write me <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things my dear Brother, and fear not that you shall ever want my sympathy. Keep diligent in business, fervent in spirit, serving God: that is the sum of all wisdom.&#x2014; My Paper is near done; I feel sure I have forgotten much. No news from Irving or of him: the Tongue concern is quite out in this quarter: my poor lost Friend! Lost to me, to the world and to himself.&#x2014; I found a Letter from Mill lying here for me: it is mostly about Books and Editors: Glen had been in Scotland, and Mill supposed him to have seen us, which he did not. Fraser has been <hi rend="italic">again</hi> electioneering; he lost Hythe (for the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> time, we hope) by a great majority.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hythe was now restricted to one representative (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300823-TC-HI-01">TC to HI, <date when="1830-08-23">23 Aug. 1830</date>)</ref>, and the result was that Stewart Marjoribanks, the former Tory representative, was elected by 223 votes to William Fraser&#x2019;s 192.</note> Brewster tells me he is not rich: if he take no better heed, he may by and by be poor enough. Far from any <hi rend="italic">Answer</hi> arriving from Badams and Holcroft, the two <hi rend="italic">Twopenny</hi> Letters I had sent them (or Holcroft rather, to whom they were <hi rend="italic">both</hi> sent) came back thro&#x2019; the Dead-letter Office about a month ago, with large post-dues, and notice that H. had &#x201C;left, not known whither.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> still comes from him. I know not well what to do now: I think of trying, thro&#x2019; the office of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Herald</hi>, now that a frank might be had.&#x2014; By the bye, did I tell you that there was to be a new Radical Paper started at Dumfries; Douglas (of the <pb id="pg-06-294" n="06:294"/>Spectator, and Inverkeithing) to be Editor? He had arrived just two days before we came off; but I saw nothing of him. It is thought the thing cannot succeed&#x2014;for want of money: there are nothing but a lower sort of writers in it; hungry and contentious: I can only promise them that from Douglas they will get as good as they bring.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320114-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1832-01-14">14 Jan. 1832</date></ref>.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I sit down to fulfil my promise of writing to you; the more gladly as tho&#x2019; there is not much to say, there is nothing to say that is bad. Jamie will have given you our history up to the point of starting on the Thornhill Coach. We found the fares <hi rend="italic">raised</hi> from Saturday night to Monday morning; which circumstances mainly provoked me to take an outside seat, not an inside; and so after all deprive the greedy scout (Clarke of Dumfries, whose work it was) of any additional profit by me, nay bring him to make five shillings less.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ambrose Clarke was proprietor of the Dumfries and Galloway Hotel and of the coach (the &#x201C;Robert Burns&#x201D;) which left from it. A &#x201C;scout&#x201D; is someone contemptible.</note> The outside seat (about which I doubt you have been grieving all this while) was much the better of the two kinds, and could at any time be exchanged for an inside; the weather being so remarkably good: indeed, that was the very best day we could have got had we had our choice for a month. About eight o&#x2019;clock at night, we were all finally landed here, without the smallest injury; found fires lighted, even tea-dishes set out; and soon made ourselves quite at home. Next day the Carrier faithfully delivered all our luggage; the next again, that Trunk which Jamie might tell you had been left at Thornhill, was also handed in safe and entire: the goods are now all dispersed over presses, storerooms and chests of drawers; and so at length, as the saying goes, Here we <hi rend="italic">are!</hi> Our accommodation is such as ought to content us very well: it is a fine street this, like the best sort in the New Town; our <pb id="pg-06-296" n="06:296"/>floor is in the corner house, and fronts two ways, one way into a sort of circus, where huge trees are growing, and a great body of rooks even now keep up a cawing. You remember something of Stockbridge (we are a little way to the <hi rend="italic">left</hi> hand, just when you have crossed the Bridge from the Edinburgh side), and how clean a smokeless kind of place it was: indeed the <foreign>reek</foreign> generally of <hi rend="italic">Auld Reekie</hi> seems the clearness of mountain tops compared with the horrible vapours of London. The streets too look all so orderly and airy; and every here and there one meets with some known face as if one were still at home. Within doors we have space enough for all purposes: a large kitchen, two large and even handsome rooms (in one of which I now write, and <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> to study) as dining-room and drawing-room; three bedrooms; with all manner of <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign> too tedious to mention. The <hi rend="italic">height</hi> of the whole cannot be less I think than <hi rend="italic">sixteen feet!</hi> They are such windows there as I have seldom seen. The only beggarly thing about the whole establishment is the Beds. Wretched, crazy, creaking Tent-beds, on which no man of any stature can spread himself with freedom; hangings of the miserablest cotton, bedding hollowed out into a <hi rend="italic">ditch</hi> in the middle; and of bed-clothes such plenty, that we put all the blankets in the house into one bed! However we had partly foreseen this last evil; and brought over a store of blankets to Templand, ready to be sent for at any time: and now just while Jane was about writing for them, one of her Aunts here tells her that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> have about 30 pairs of good Scotch blankets, which they will lend us joyfully any part of; which accordingly we purpose to supply our want from. There is no kind of clock in the house; but I have laid out my watch, into a woollen mat on a table: if Alick or Jamie could get me that same &#x2018;Twenty-shillings Watch&#x2019; I was once talking of, and send it hither, it were very welcome. I should have added that as to the <hi rend="italic">ditch</hi>-shape of our couches we fell upon a notable device: tumbled out all the matrasses [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], tightened up the canvas, and then&#x2014;filled up the centre of the space to the height wanted with <hi rend="italic">good rye grass Hay;</hi> which when the bedding is replaced and all put in order again makes a quite level, very tolerable thing of it. To such uses are materials put: this Hay, which Rowantree<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320731-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1832-07-31">31 July 1832</date></ref>.</note> painfully <hi rend="italic">got</hi> on the <foreign>braes</foreign> of Dunscore, descends not into our Cow&#x2019;s stomach there to be made milk of, but into Mrs Colquhoun&#x2019;s (<hi rend="italic">Cohoon&#x2019;s</hi>) Bed there to bring the sleepy a little rest.</p>
<p>Thus you see, my Dear Mother, we are likely to be very well <pb id="pg-06-297" n="06:297"/>situated here, so far as outward things go; may live agreeably enough till the spring come back; profitably one <hi rend="italic">can</hi> at all times live, if he rightly will. My health, I expect will continue as good as it was; for I shall <supplied>[have]</supplied> more exercise and spiritual entertainment. Jane, poor little <foreign>lassie</foreign>, slept very ill the first two nights (till we got used, and the <hi rend="italic">ditch</hi>-beds put right); but has now come into her old way again: she has farther got a very worthy old Doctor, an intimate friend of her Father&#x2019;s, to attend upon her; who shows the greatest affection and attention, and really far more reasonableness than any Doctor I have ever seen in these parts. It is old Dr Hamilton,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330210-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-02-10">10 Feb.</date></ref></note> a notable man here, called <hi rend="italic">cockie</hi> Hamilton, for he still wears a cocked hat; and is indeed quite an old-fashioned person,&#x2014;a better kind, I think, than the <hi rend="italic">new</hi>-fashioned. Perhaps he may do her some good; which is the likelier, as in the meantime he refuses to <hi rend="italic">prescribe</hi>, and only waits and observes, declaring that her present method of management seems quite good.</p>
<p>Already we have had a variety of visits; and have called on several. Jeffrey was here yesterday, but did not find us in. I saw Napier, in great haste; and shall by and by perhaps come into closer investigation of him. Henry Inglis sat with us some hours last night: he has got married, and has a child; and looks a good deal wiser; as affectionate as ever. John Gordon has at length, after many years of hunting, caught a kind of place, a Secretaryship in the College; which will enable him, with what he already has, to live with some security; safe against cleanness of teeth.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320528-TC-MN-01">TC to MN, <date when="1832-05-28">28 May 1832</date></ref>.</note> There are no bounds to his regard for me; otherwise he is a wearisome man. Professor Wilson has just lost a Sister; so I have not yet seen him. Dr Irving of the Advocates&#x2019; Library told me the day before yesterday that poor Frank Dixon had at length got quit of all earthly woes: he died, about Moffat, some two or three months ago. Poor Frank! I daresay, in all the British Lands there has not been for the last ten years a more wretched man than he: but now <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is of no moment, and the question is quite another. Yesterday I met Mitc<supplied>[hell]</supplied> in the street, and walked home with him: he has suffered much within the last two years; has had the worst health; and even now looks exceedingly ill; with a short, unsound cough, headaches, great weakness: I fear he is far from out of danger. Such are the various lots of men. Yesterday also I saw my old comrade Murray: he is withered up into a poor sapless creature; keeps boarders, had two <hi rend="italic">prattlers</hi> jingling the pokers and so forth; also his Picture in oil grinning on him from the wall; seems meanwhile well at ease, and moderately <pb id="pg-06-298" n="06:298"/>glad that he is what he is: there let him play his part, with a blessing! Robert Welsh they say is looking in bad health: today at three o&#x2019;clock I am to go and witness the Baptism of his child, and see him for the first time. I have dined at old Mr Bradfute&#x2019;s, who was very hospitable; had come over hither the very day after our arrival, a great effort for him. On the whole, we have every reason to be well content with the feeling people show towards us: <hi rend="italic">people</hi> indeed <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do one but little good, and but little ill; however, what we could wish of them here they freely offer; which ought to be reckoned among our mercies, whereof now as always there are <hi rend="italic">many</hi>.</p>
<p>The Letter which lay waiting here was not from the Doctor, but from John Mill:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1832-12-27">27 Dec. 1832</date>.</note> I wrote to the Doctor the day after our arrival, and told him all about Scotsbrig: I think he must be waiting for some certainty about our Edinburgh journey; yet may perhaps write within some fortnight or so: I will send you immediate word about it.&#x2014; I sent off both the Newspapers yesterday; I think you will get yours today; they will not be <hi rend="italic">later</hi> next week; perhaps afterwards a day earlier, if I had once got the news of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Address here conveyed to London; as yet, the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> has to come round by Dumfries. You, on your side, must not and will not be slack in sending me news; consider that I get no weekly paper. But Jane, I know, will prove true: she shall find me always active in replying. I sent her a short Note (at her request) by Jamie; perhaps you guess on what subject. Tell her farther that I again <hi rend="italic">only</hi> wish her to exercise her own discretion, and have the most perfect confidence that she will see her way thro&#x2019; it, and pursue the right way. For the rest, that whatever makes <hi rend="italic">her</hi> happy will meet <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my wishes in regard to it. But, in any case, the proverb says, &#x2018;there is luck in leisure.&#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial. Cf. George Meriton, <hi rend="italic">A Yorkshire Dialogue</hi> (<date when="1683-00-00">1683</date>), l. 193.</note> On the whole she is a wise true girl; also, &#x2018;a <hi rend="italic">determint body&#x2019;:</hi> I have no apprehension for her.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His sister Jean had already referred to James Aitken, whom she married on <date when="1833-11-11">11 November</date>, as her &#x201C;Sweetheartkin&#x201D; (see postscript to <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321017-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-10-17">17 Oct. 1832</date>)</ref>. The whereabouts of Carlyle&#x2019;s letter to her is not now known, but we do know from Jean&#x2019;s letter to him of <date when="1833-10-22">22 Oct. 1833</date> that it was written from Templand (<date when="1832-12-16">16</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-12-24">24 Dec., 1832</date>) and that she said of it that it was &#x201C;very kind and Fatherly,&#x201D; insisting &#x201C;chiefly on deliberation.&#x201D;</note> Give my kind love to all and sundry of the rest: they may all help Jane with filling of the sheet. For yourself, my dear Mother, I can only again advise, Be careful of your health; live, as you have long done, in dependence on the Great Giver, who will never leave you nor forsake you; and from us your much indebted children expect as your good right all <pb id="pg-06-299" n="06:299"/>that we can do to help you. I am very glad I came thro&#x2019; the <foreign>snow-broo</foreign> [slush] to see you; I shall feel much easier for it while I am here. And so, dear Mother, live in hope, in this Place of Hope, and know well that God is <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> waiting to be good. May He bless you all and always!</p>

<ps><p>If Jeffrey come in today, I will make him frank this: if not, I know you will pay your 8&#xBD;<hi rend="italic">d</hi> cheerfully; tho&#x2019; certainly you have but a dear pennyworth of it.&#x2014; You shall not be troubled with this wretched <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> again: I have but one sheet of the old sort left (which I have to write on to a Stranger, to Mill): I bought this last night; but prudently and luckily took only four sheets of it. It is very bad.</p>
<p>Perhaps in some weeks I may send you a Book-parcel by the Dumfries Bookseller, which you will get by Notman. Tell Jane not to forget to mention whether it is the Scots Worthies or the Cloud of Witnesses<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321119-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1832-11-19">19 Nov. 1832</date></ref>.</note> that you have.</p>
<p>[JWC:] God bless you all! he has left me nothing else to say&#x2014;yes&#x2014;I may repeat what is no news that the butter pig is safe and excellent&#x2014;we have a delightful house here&#x2014;and my own old D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is going to cure me so that I shall be able to enjoy my blessings&#x2014; I have heard from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu&#x2014;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the same day Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;Edinburgh, <date when="1833-01-12">12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1833</date>.&#x2014; Arrived here on Monday night last [<date when="1833-01-07">7 Jan.</date>]. Frosty fog; ghastly kind of light and silence in Dalveen Pass; the wearisome, dreaming-awake kind of day I always have in Stage coaches. Mill&#x2019;s Letter awaiting me here. Wrote to Jack; am getting anxious to hear from him. Village-like impression of Edinburgh, after London. People are all kind; I languid, bilious, not very open to kindness.
<p>&#x201C;Dr. Irving advises immediate application for a certain Glasgow Astronomy Professorship. I shall hardly trouble myself with it. <hi rend="italic">Deeply</hi> impressed with the transiency of Time; more and more careless about all that Time can give or take away. Could undertake to teach astronomy, as soon as most things, by way of honest day-labour: not otherwise, for I have no zeal now that way. To <hi rend="italic">teach</hi> any of the things I am interested in were for the present impossible; all is unfixed, nothing has as yet grown; at best is but growing. Thus too the futility of founding Universities at this time: the only University you can advantageously found were a Public Library. This is <hi rend="italic">never</hi> out of season; therefore not now, when all else in that kind is.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Have long been almost idle; have long been out of free communion with myself. Must <hi rend="italic">suffer</hi> more before I can begin thinking. Will try to write: but what? but when?</p>
<p>&#x201C;On the whole what a wretched thing is all fame! A renown of the highest sort endures say for two thousand years. And then? Why, then, a fathomless <hi rend="italic">Eternity</hi> swallows it. <hi rend="italic">Work</hi> for Eternity: not the meagre rhetorical Eternity of the Periodical Critics, but for the real Eternity, wherein dwelleth the Divine! Alas, all <hi rend="italic">here</hi> is so dark: keep firm in thy eye what Light thou hast.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Daily and yearly the world Natural grows more of a world Magical to me: this is as it should be. Daily, too, I see that there is no true poetry but in <hi rend="italic">Reality</hi>. Wilt <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> ever be a Poetkin! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schwerlich</hi></foreign> [hardly]. No matter.&#x2014;&#x201D;</p></note></p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1832-12-27">27 Dec. 1832</date>.</note> lay here on the mantel-piece, to greet my arrival on Monday night; the reading of it seasoned our first cup of tea, and already gave us something of the feeling of home. I must now write to you, very hurriedly; were it only to bring our Correspondence once more into train. Any interruption of it were a loss to me at present: there is something in your honest fellow-feeling, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">klare Theilnahme</hi></foreign> [clear sympathy], that I could not afford to part with. Man is infinitely precious to man! This truth one should know; and along with it the other truth, which I for many years too exclusively insisted on, that man is sufficient for himself.</p>
<p>We arrived here, under clouds of cigar-smoke, in perfect safety; and during the next two days, our rather multifarious Luggage had also come to hand uninjured, and been arranged in its new repositories; and again one could in some measure say, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Me voici</hi></foreign> [Here I am]. We have a really pleasant spacious habitation here; on the northwest verge of the City; the Water of Leith flowing by not far on the right; left and straight forwards (for we front two ways) broad clear spaces with huge trees growing thro&#x2019; the pavement, where multitudes of rooks are even now making a quite rustic melody. Edinburgh, which I wish you <hi rend="italic">were</hi> here to see with me, is but a kind of village compared to London: to me with my former impressions still fresh, it all looks inexpressibly contracted, orderly, snug, as a village should; to which feeling also the many known faces you meet on the street contribute. Thus we have a pleasant feeling of <hi rend="italic">homeness;</hi> and want that mighty roar of the London Life&#x2014;torrent, which was alternately one of the most saddenning and one of the most inspiring sights I ever looked on; altogether a prophetic-looking sight. This place is called by the country people <foreign><hi rend="italic">Auld Reekie;</hi></foreign> yet the <foreign>reek</foreign> here is but a faint breath of blue incense to that horrid flood of Spartan black-broth one has to inhale in London; fogs and mud therefore we happily <pb id="pg-06-301" n="06:301"/>consider as left behind us. On the other hand one must put up with much that is spiritually <foreign><hi rend="italic">kleinstadtisch</hi></foreign> [provincial]: for example, I heard a man yesterday three times over characterise M&#x2019;Culloch&#x2019;s Commercial Dictionary,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Ramsay McCulloch (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210110-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:307</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-01-10">10 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>) was the author of <hi rend="italic">A Dictionary, Practical, Theoretical, and Historical, of Commerce and Commercial Navigation,</hi> 2 vols. (London, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>).</note> with a look of true enthusiasm, by the epithet &#x201C;stupendous.&#x201D; I feel indeed that no John Mill will come in on the wednesday evenings here; but a much fainter sort of spiritual worth must suffice. One man of a sincere character, as I understand the word sincere, would never yet turn up for me in these parts. However, we must look again: we have engaged this house (properly a Floor, as you have seen in Paris) for three months; in such environment till the Spring weather return you can figure us.</p>
<p>I have seen Napier, and set him anew to work about these Books, which he fancies to be here with Adam Black: what the result of his efforts have been I yet know not. A vexatious business; about which however not to spoil your kindness I will not vex myself: if the Books be lost, you must let me replace them, and there will be the end. Napier I find is an old acquaintance of your Father&#x2019;s: I hope to find something in him, for he is not without force; meanwhile however he listens with silence and amazement to my Teufelsdreckism; being himself a solid old-established Edinburgh Whig. A plentiful species here; which begins to see however that the world is wider than it fancied, and to have qualms enough. The Radicals, I believe, are but a rabid, distracted, avoidable set of men, of the Hunt and Cobbett sort. Tait I notice has enlarged his windows very much; and hoisted a standard of Pasteboard inside, whereon in huge party-coloured letters, I read only: &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">m a g a z i n e</hi><supplied>[.]</supplied>&#x201D; The man himself I have not yet met with.</p>
<p>The other Book-packet came safe; and what is more, has now been all pretty faithfully perused. I find little of worth for more than a day in that Repository; only one Paper which brought any kind of movement into me; the Authorship of which I could have sworn to after the second page.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill&#x2019;s &#x201C;What Is Poetry?&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository</hi>, VII (<date when="1833-01-00">Jan., 1833</date>), 60&#x2013;70. Mill comments on it in his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1832-12-27">27 Dec. 1832</date>: &#x201C;The result is not satisfactory to me and will probably be far less so to you&#x2014;but you will tell me to what extent you think me wrong, or shallow.&#x201D;</note> It is a very true thing; the writer comforts you above all by this, that he evidently has himself begun to see what a quite infinite difference there is between <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schein</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Seyn</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">seeming</hi> and <hi rend="italic">being</hi>] by which great act of vision alone do all others become possible. I shall be very glad to get your next paper, and endeavour to <pb id="pg-06-302" n="06:302"/>tell you faithfully what I think of it. That reproof of the half-and-half <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> Editor I recognised in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The article was &#x201C;French and English Journals,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1832-12-02">2 Dec. 1832</date>, pp. 772&#x2013;73. The editor of the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> was Walter Coulson (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>).</note> as I generally do your hand there.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Thiers</hi> is a rather good Book,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis Adolphe Thiers (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>), <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la R&#xE9;volution Fran&#x26;ccedil;aise</hi>, 10 vols. (Paris, <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">27</date>).</note> and has taught me several things. I read it over with great avidity; following anew the developments of that frightful world-drama with a new interest. What chiefly attracts me, however, is a face of the matter in which M. Thiers unfortunately is rather uncommunicative: what I might call the private biographic phasis; the manner in which individuals demeaned themselves, and social life went on, in so extraordinary an element as that; the most extraordinary, one might say, for the &#x201C;thin rind of Habit&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> was utterly rent off; and man stood there, with all the powers of Civilization, and none of its rules to aid him in guiding these. There is much that I would fain investigate farther in this sense: if you know any other Books that might forward me would you name them, for I am now beside Books. For instance, any Book about the state of the Prisons, the behaviour of the Prisoners, under Fouquier Tinville&#x2019;s reign?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville (<date when="1746-00-00">1746</date>&#x2013;<date when="1795-00-00">95</date>), radical politician and public prosecutor in the Revolutionary Tribunal (<date when="1793-03-00">March 1793</date> to <date when="1794-07-00">July 1794</date>), later Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;rat-eyed Incarnation of Attorneyism&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution, Works</hi>, IV, 304. See also Carlyle&#x2019;s chapter &#x201C;The Prisons,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., pp. 270&#x2013;73.</note> I have heard of a work expressly composed of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Bonmots</hi></foreign> uttered on the scaffold then. More <hi rend="italic">queues</hi> formed at the Baker&#x2019;s shops, and generally that whole business of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Assignats</hi></foreign>,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bonds or paper money issued by the revolutionary government from <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date> to <date when="1796-00-00">1796</date> and secured by property confiscated from the Church and Crown.</note> how it worked and was endured struck me as worth looking into farther than I could yet look. Does Say<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Baptiste Say (<date when="1767-00-00">1767</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), French economist who expounded the doctrines of Adam Smith. It happens that he lost money himself through the <foreign>Assignats</foreign>.</note> or any of their Economists communicate a clear idea of these things anywhere? I do not so much as understand sufficiently what an <foreign><hi rend="italic">Assignat</hi></foreign> was; and wished often I had been there to buy one when they were so cheap, that I might see how it was worded. Then again, is there any Life of Danton? Three men especially impressed me in that whole Revolution: Mirabeau, Danton, Bonaparte. The rest I think were mostly but common men in an uncommon environment. Danton I pardoned many things, and pitied heartily at last, the rather as I was wont once to talk of him <foreign>&#xE0; la</foreign> Walter Scott simply as a &#x201C;Tiger,&#x201D; <pb id="pg-06-303" n="06:303"/>and imagine that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> explained him.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Scott, <hi rend="italic">Life of Napoleon Buonparte</hi>, 9 vols.

He will prove to you that the power to have done a thing almost (if not altogether) gave you the right to do it: every hero of his turns out to be perfectly justified in doing whatsoever&#x2014;he has succeeded in doing. This seemed to me notable; with much else in Thiers; his affected touches of the Tacitus kind; his hard, mechanical, all-for-politics disposition: characteristic, I imagine, of the modern French school generally. That <hi rend="italic">morality</hi> of his especially leads far if you inquire into it.&#x2014; which here, alas, I have no room to do.&#x2014; I have t<supplied>[he]</supplied> Book <hi rend="italic">Thiers</hi>, and the others, here with me, and will take care that they be not lost in an E<supplied>[din]</supplied>burgh Warehouse; but wish to examine some of them a little farther, if you do not need them immediately.&#x2014; My Scotch Church History studies have also advanced a little; strangely blended with these French Antichurch ones; with which however they are not so incongruous as might seem. Knox&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History</hi>,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321119-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1832-11-19">19 Nov. 1832</date></ref>.</note> written in Scotch, with great emphasis, and a certain sardonic humour, has amused me: I find in Knox one of those unmanageable fellows who once for all have taken in hand to act and speak not respectably but honestly; and have no manner of notion that God&#x2019;s Truth should alter its attitude for man&#x2019;s pleasure, be the man who he may: a true Reformer, of the sort much wanted now and always, seldom rarer than now.</p>
<p>You infer that I have written little; not perhaps which is the fact that I have written absolutely nothing. Conscience will not much longer suffer this; I seldom write from any cause but the terrors of an evil conscience. What it is to be I cannot yet tell: my doors of utterance are so wonderful, one knows not how to shape thoughts such as to pass thro&#x2019;. My head, as ever, is all buzzing with the Seen, the Problematical, the dim forecast of the Unseen: at every new stage, one has a new Reform Bill to pass for oneself; and then, alas, the old Temples and Theatres are all closed up, and nothing remains but the Synod of Periodicals. A troublous Time! Meanwhile, <hi rend="italic">employ</hi> it; lament not over it, for in <hi rend="italic">so</hi> doing thou altogether losest it. Now, however, I must pause a moment for business&#x2019; sake. I have a commission or two to trouble you with again.</p>
<p>Will you for one thing intimate to Cochrane (39. Edwardes Square Kensington) by the Twopenny Post or any way that I am here, under this address. Secondly in regard to the coming of the Examiner, I am in a sort of puzzle which you shall now judge of. My consigner is <pb id="pg-06-304" n="06:304"/>one Thomas Holcroft (a son of the Dramatist Holcroft&#x2019;s, and brother-in-law to a Mr Badams a very old friend of mine): I wrote to this Holcroft, six weeks ago, a note inclosing one to Badams; they went by the same packet that took your last; and, alas, about ten days after returned to me thro&#x2019; the Dead Letter Office, Holcroft having left the Adelphi &#x2018;not known whither.&#x2019; Nevertheless the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> comes, and will continue to come (round by Dumfries) like a blind physical event. What am I to do? I bethink me that Holcroft is a Reporter (or was, and had long been, at least) on the <hi rend="italic">Morning Herald:</hi> you can now determine whether he is discoverable in that way (or failing this, I daresay &#x201C;Place the Tailor&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Place (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), radical reformer.</note> knows of him); and if <hi rend="italic">yea</hi>, then I will ask you to write him a Note, saying that I am here, and want the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> here, and Badams&#x2019;s address and his.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill wrote to Carlyle on <date when="1833-02-02">2 Feb.</date> (Mineka, XII, 137&#x2013;41) to say that Holcroft had moved to 13 Bartlett&#x2019;s Buildings, Holborn.

We did not see Glen, or hear of him: I will still desire you to keep <supplied>[an]</supplied> eye on him, and do for him what you can, at worst be sorry for him.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I sympathize truly with the painful incident that has befallen you. Your little Son has been lent you but a short while;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander had written to Carlyle on <date when="1833-01-19">19 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;Last saturday night Jeny and I went to bed with our two little children as usual, little knowing what was awaiting us, and before four o&#x2019;clock in the morning our poor little son had breathed his last. He had for some few days before been ailing a little with the cold as we thought but seemed better on the friday and saturday. My first impression was that he had been over-laid when Jeny shrieked out &#x2018;Sandy I dinna hear the <foreign>bairn</foreign> breathing&#x2019;<supplied>[.]</supplied> I held the lifeless body of the little way-faring stranger in my arms and in desperation in the darkness not knowing to what hand to turn vainly enough tryed to breath into the, alas, unbreathing body till Jeny lighted the candle when we soon saw that all was over. In the course of a few hours the lower part of the body and thighs was all covered with dark purple spots thereby proving as they told us that the child had died of what they called <hi rend="italic">Hives</hi>. It yielded to us a sort of melancholy solace to be led to believe that our little infant had not died of suffocation but of some inward complaint that we neither knew the nature nor the name of.&#x201D; For &#x201C;way-faring stranger,&#x201D; cf. Jer. 9:2.</note> has but as it were opened his eyes on this strange chaos of <hi rend="small-caps">Time</hi>, and then as if <pb id="pg-06-306" n="06:306"/>affrighted, shrunk back into <hi rend="small-caps">Eternity</hi>, hiding himself from the Sin and woe in which we that are left on Earth must still struggle. There is something infinitely touching in a history so brief and yet so tragic; something infinitely mysterious too: but indeed the longest life is scarcely longer than the shortest if we think of the Eternity that encircles both; and so it is all mysterious, all awful and likewise holy; and our sole wisdom is to bow down before our inscrutable Author, and say heartily in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things, God&#x2019;s will be done. The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away; blessed be the name of the Lord!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 1:21 and Ps. 113:2.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014; I have many times pictured to myself that stern awakening you got: &#x201C;I dinna hear the <foreign>bairn</foreign> breathing&#x201D;! Yet surely as you observe it was a blessed mercy that you found the event to have happened, as it were by the will of Providence alone; and without mischance on your part, which would have rendered the affliction doubly severe. In all our griefs, it is truly said, there is something of mercy mingled. And so we will bid the little Wayfarer whose journey was so short, Farewell: he is but gone whither we too are hastening to follow.&#x2014;</p>
<p>This winter I can figure you out in your Country home, a little less lonely than the last: your household is more stirring, and you are in a neighbourhood where one likes better to fancy you. I trust firmly still that the change was for your good. Continue to be diligent and prudent, and you have nothing evil to apprehend. The times and the country we live in press heavy on us all: but a certain hope of improvement is still reasonable; nay far better than any hope, a perfect assurance that if our Task be well done (which is always in our own power) all else will be well with us. So let the evil of the day be sufficient for the day:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 6:34.</note> what the future may offer we will try to be ready for. Time and Chance, as Solomon long since declared, happen unto all.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 9:11.</note></p>
<p>It is pleasant for me to consider you as now once more in a Neighbourhood: I need not counsel to study &#x201C;as much as in you lies&#x201D; to live in peace, in good will and sympathy with all men, more especially with those nearest you, whom you have most to do with. It is this mainly of having persons one takes interest in around one&#x2019;s house that makes a House into the far more precious thing, a Home. In all mortals one finds flaws; nay <hi rend="italic">in oneself</hi> more than in any other: therefore let us pity and pardon; even the poor creature that <hi rend="italic">wrongs</hi> us was sore driven to his shifts, or he would not have wronged us; <pb id="pg-06-307" n="06:307"/>he too is pitiable and pardonable. By the way, I hope poor Brand<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander had written that his brother James and William Brand had been riding on horses which became frightened and that Brand&#x2019;s horse (&#x201C;your old mare,&#x201D; Alexander told Carlyle) had thrown him to the ground. His face was badly &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">smashed</hi>,&#x201D; and he had to be nursed at Scotsbrig for some time afterward. For Brand, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310911-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-09-11">11 Sept. 1831</date></ref>.</note> has got home again, and feels himself recovering. Tell him from me that he ought to sell that great stalking animal; and let it run in some Opposition Coach, where it may do the world some service for its oats: in any other way, it looks as if no good would come of it. Next time you write I hope you will farther have to tell me that your <hi rend="italic">financial</hi> reckonings have not disappointed you; but that the Rent is actually all ready, if not paid; and so the Catlinns speculation looking as we all wish it. We will pray always: May the worst of our toils be past! In fine I will ask only one thing: that you would mend that Bridge (down at the old mill): assuredly some one will get a mischief by it, if you do not; at present I cannot think of it without a kind of horror. Mind this, now, and take warning in time.</p>
<p>I have been living here in a curious unsatisfactory half-awake state: the transi<supplied>[ti]</supplied>on is so singular from bare solitary moors, with only myself for company, to crowded streets and the converse of men. Both Jane and I, moreover, have been in a <foreign>feckless</foreign> [spiritless] sort of state with a dirty sneaking <hi rend="italic">sniftering</hi> sort of Cold (now nearly gone), which confuses one&#x2019;s ideas, were there nothing else to do it. I am carrying on a sort of occupation; but not with so much energy as I could desire; still only with the assurance that I shall grow energetic. The people (of whom we see abundance) are all kind and courteous as heart could reasonably wish: nevertheless I feel myself singularly a stranger among them: their notions are not mine; the things they a<supplied>[re]</supplied> running the race for are no prizes to me. In politics, especially as here manifested, I take no pleasure at all: the Tories, now happily driven into holes and corners, are quite out of date; all the rest is Whiggery and Reform-Bill-for-ever, a most sandblind feeble sort of concern; a few Radicals of the Henry Hunt<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), at this time M.P. for Preston but lost his seat later in the year when he became a blacking manufacturer. He had presided at the Manchester reform meeting (<date when="1819-08-16">16 Aug. 1819</date>) which was forcibly broken up by the &#x201C;Peterloo Massacre.&#x201D; While imprisoned for two years, he wrote his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>).</note> sort are a still more pitiable set. The men stare at me when I give voice; I listen when they have the word, &#x201C;with a sigh or a smile.&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Thomas Moore, &#x201C;Nets and Cages,&#x201D; ll. 11&#x2013;12.</note> One great benefit I have, and can enjoy without drawback: abundance of Books. I am <pb id="pg-06-308" n="06:308"/>almost daily in the Advocates&#x2019; Library, ransacking many things; my appetite sharpened by long abstinence. On the whole, we do well (for this dirty <hi rend="italic">sniftering</hi> is about over); and one way or other, generally to profit, the mind is kept full. Edinburgh affects me quite peculiarly after London: it looks all so orderly, so quiet, so little. I incline often to wish we had never left it: yet properly I cherish no regret for what is gone; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> too had its worth, its influence on me for good, and lay among the things I had to do. I feel however more and more <hi rend="italic">plainly</hi> that Craigenputtoch will absolutely never prove a wholesome abode for me; that I must try to get away from it, the sooner the better: however, there is evidently no immediate prospect of of [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] such a thing, and in any case, we will <hi rend="italic">do nothing rashly</hi>. I privately think sometimes we should not settle upon anything till Jack come home; of which I privately am very glad that there is now a prospect. Dr Irving, Keeper of the Advocates&#x2019; Library, of whom you have heard me speak, has been talking lately very often about a Professorship at Glasgow,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The chair of practical astronomy, held by Rev. James Couper (<date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), which was not vacated until <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date> when the new professor was John Pringle Nichol (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>). Carlyle is said to have been a candidate.</note> which will soon be vacant the present incumbent being very old: this as a thing that will be in the Lord Advocate&#x2019;s gift, our worthy Doctor thinks were the very thing for me. I bite at it with no eagerness: yet have hinted it to Jeffrey, and will not neglect it if it come in my way. We shall see. My own private impression is that I shall never get any promotion in this world; and happy shall I be if Providence enable me only to stand <hi rend="italic">my own</hi> friend. That is (or should be) all the prayer I offer to Heaven.&#x2014;&#x2014; In Literature all is as dull here as it could possibly be: my old Manuscript<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>.</note> is lying by me quiet; there is no likelihood of its being printed this winter, for I have not the Cash just ready and it is a thing that can wait. I do not think of vexing my soul with <hi rend="italic">Booksellers</hi> about it or any other thing again,&#x2014;so long as I can help it.&#x2014; But, alas, dear Alick, my sheet is done. Our Mother has a Letter too, which she will read you; where will be found a little more news. By the way, may I trust that Jamie and you have come to some fixed measures about those Ecclefechan Houses<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Which James Carlyle had left to his wife and which provided her with some &#xa3;28 yearly. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320522-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-05-22">22 May 1832</date></ref>.</note> and their management; and so relieving our good Mother from anxiety on that score. I know you will do what in you lies: it is well the part of us all.&#x2014; Jane sends her best wishes to her Namesake, and every one of you.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Perhaps I should not have written so soon, but the Advocate is going off in two days, and I think it is a pity you should not have the advantage of at least one Frank: with all the Franks I can get my Correspondence will prove but a bad bargain; tho&#x2019; I know you will not think it so.</p>
<p>We were much frightened at first, and then sad and yet thankful, by Alick and Jane&#x2019;s Letter, which found us on the Wednesday morning still in bed, for these Letters seem to go round by Carlisle, and so arrive at a peculiar hour. Poor Alick has had a sad shock; and the death of any human being is a weighty solemn matter. I hope they reconcile themselves to their loss, and in this as in all things study to be submissive, to be teachable; for it is a great truth this which you often tell us, that nothing comes unsent, that all is a Lesson to us, if we will but be wise and <hi rend="italic">learn</hi>. William Brand I trust is recovering fast; and will part with that unhappy Beast by the earliest opportunity, for it seems to luck [prosper] nowhere on this side of the <pb id="pg-06-310" n="06:310"/>Solway. It was a great mercy the poor fellow was not killed on the spot.</p>
<p>The news from Jack gave us great pleasure; for we were beginning to weary for tidings of him: he has still two Letters of mine to account for; so &#x201C;within the month&#x201D; we shall expect to hear something.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had not yet received John&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1833-01-14">14 Jan.</date> and refers to news contained in a letter from John to his mother, some details of which had been relayed to Edinburgh by Jean Carlyle.</note> I rather guess that <date when="1833-10-00">October</date> may be the soonest of their return, so many things may and indeed must intervene: but indeed the Lady&#x2019;s will is a quite loose foundation to calculate on, so we must wait and see. I am very glad for all our sakes, and not very sorry for his own, that the Doctor is about returning: he will return with something in his Purse to help him wherever he go, and with something in his Head (better than he had), which is still more important. Now as always we will hope the best.</p>
<p>As for ourselves, all is about as it was and should be. Were it not that I made a point of telling you <hi rend="italic">everything</hi> (whereby when <hi rend="italic">no</hi> news come you can be sure nothing has happened), I need not have mentioned a paltry little running at the nose, which has been annoying these four or five days, but less and less for the last three. I got it mainly by two Dinners I had to go to: one with old Mr Bradfute, and then another next night with the Advocate; a piece of kindness which I would fain hope no friend of mine may soon press me to again. But now I having caught this bit of cold out of Space in general, Jane who is always ready for whatever is going caught it from me; and so here we sit <hi rend="italic">sniftering</hi> in concert according to form. I will have <hi rend="italic">castor</hi> tomorrow for my share (all other remedies are worth nothing); and unless the day be dry keep within doors for one four-and-twenty hours, and so be done with it. In all other respects, we are about altogether in the way you wish us in: The finest quiet winter weather; frost alternating with thaw as softly as may be, without blustering or fall; clean pleasant walks and streets to move on; and here and there a blithe face to bid us welcome. Jane is loud in celebrating the Edinburgh shop keepers for their &#x201C;high notions of honour&#x201D; as contrasted with the London brethren: how they stand to their price like iron, give you a sound article for solid money, and are not afraid of your <hi rend="italic">stealing</hi> anything. Nevertheless she thinks matters have not improved with them since we left the place: their shops have generally a duller dimmer look, all wears the air as if it were not prospering much. Houses, for one thing, they say are quite ruinously cheap; a mansion <pb id="pg-06-311" n="06:311"/>built four years ago for two thousand pounds will hardly now fetch eight hundred! To such length has this branch of trade been overworked.</p>
<p>In my particular craft there seems to be nothing or very little astir; all people are either selling Penny Magazines, or lying on their oars. I get no good of any Editor or Publisher I have yet seen; come into no closer terms with them; I suppose they rather think me a dangerous sort of fellow: happily too I need not disturb myself a jot about one of them; having work enough elsewhere if I had three hands to work with. The truth is they are all at a kind of stand, poor fellows; and know not clearly on what side to turn them. We see abundance of people; most of them, unhappily, are but unprofitable sights, yet at worst harmless, and good compared to <hi rend="italic">none</hi>. Jeffrey is here very often; talking like a pen-gun<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A &#x201C;pen-gun&#x201D; was a toy airgun made from a quill. The expression means to talk without stopping.</note> (of very <hi rend="italic">light</hi> calibre), always brisk and in good humour: he looks a great deal stronger than he did in London, is a little delighted with his Election; and ready again to go and have himself half-killed&#x2014;for nothing! Such is man&#x2019;s lot. I have seen Macvey Napier twice: a dry, fainthearted, wooden kind of man, whom I think I shall not get far with. For the rest, he seems honest of heart, shrewd enough, and values me abundantly. Wilson I have not yet seen, and really care not very much about seeing. I rather fancy he dislikes my Radicalism, worse than I do his Toryism: we are likely to meet some day. George Moir (the little Aberdeen Advocate once at Craigenputtoch) gets me Books, and comes up to tea; a clever, lively little fellow: he has got a house and a wife and two small children since we were here: the Jeffreys and he however (owing to Politics) are utterly quarrelled. The best man I see here, indeed the only man I care much about is Sir William Hamilton; in whom alone of all these people I find an earnest soul, an openness for truth: I really think him a genuine kind of man. His learning is great, his talent considerable; we have long talks and walks together. He is the descendent of that &#x201C;Robert Hamilton of Preston&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Robert Hamilton (<date when="1650-00-00">1650</date>&#x2013;<date when="1701-00-00">1701</date>), second baronet of Preston, who directed the Covenanting armies when they won at Drumclog and were routed at Bothwell Brig in <date when="1679-00-00">1679</date>. He was regarded as incompetent. Exiled to Holland, he returned after <date when="1688-00-00">1688</date>.</note> (rather &#x201C;a foolish man&#x201D;, as Sir W. calls him) who commanded the Cameronians at Bothwell Brig. So much for my Society here.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that I had fairly begun work, and was once in <pb id="pg-06-312" n="06:312"/>the middle of some hearty piece of writing, all in fire about it: but, alas, such is not yet my case; I am still only preparing and threatening to write. I go almost daily to the Advocates&#x2019; Library, rummaging among Books, and searching out a variety of things: by and by, I shall get buckled to the gear, and certainly do something notable,&#x2014;one would think! In the mean time you can fancy us sufficiently: breakfasting about nine; reading, or innocently tho&#x2019; still more idly employed receiving visitors till one or two; about which hour I generally go out to walk; then home to dine at four; after which the night is very generally our own, and we spend it in some sort of study till eleven, and then, if all have gone right, are sound asleep by twelve. This is the history of our day.</p>
<p>In the shape of public news I shall only mention two things: first that Dr Brewster has been a candidate for the Professorship Leslie held; and to the shame of the Town Council (an old Tory body now on its last legs) has been <hi rend="italic">rejected</hi>, in favour of a young <foreign>lad</foreign>, about three-and-twenty, the extent of whose talent, great or otherwise, is as yet known only to himself!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James David Forbes (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">68</date>). See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330108-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-01-08">8 Jan.</date></ref> and cf. the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1833-01-20">20 Jan.</date>, p. 42.</note> Brewster, whom I saw one day, has fled back into the country; and now they say is about entering the English Church, having got a Living promised him by Brougham. The scandal of the transaction seems to me considerable. My second piece of news is that a rather strong Society for abolishing Patronage in the Church of Scotland has united itself here, and is taking vigorous measures. One of the leading men is David Dixon (he whom you called the &#x201C;stupid sonks&#x201D;) himself a Patron-placed minister; another is Dr M&#x2019;Crie; another &#x26;c &#x26;c. I talked with the Advocate about it the day before yesterday; whose opinion it is that they will in some measure <hi rend="italic">succeed</hi>. So be it, say I. The Advocate seemed to have very loose notions on the subject; I did my best to set him on a better course; I fear, with little effect.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A meeting of the Society for the Abolition of Patronage had been held on <date when="1833-01-14">14 Jan.</date> Dr. Thomas M&#x2019;Crie (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210300-TC-MAC-01"><sic>1:335</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1821-03-01">1 March 1821</date></corr></ref>) and Rev. David Dickson (see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220910-TC-JAC-01"><sic>2:157</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1822-09-10">10 Sept. 1822</date></corr></ref>) were among those present. At the meeting M&#x2019;Crie had protested that &#x201C;a lay patron is as foreign to the Christian Church as a Lord Bishop,&#x201D; and that &#x201C;patronage degrades the Christian people into serfs.&#x201D; The objects of the Society, as reported by the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> (<date when="1833-01-16">16 Jan.</date>), were &#x201C;a total and unqualified abolition of patronage&#x201D; and the establishment of &#x201C;a faithful, zealous, popular and efficient minister&#x201D; in &#x201C;every parish throughout Scotland.&#x201D; The purpose of the meeting on <date when="1833-01-14">14 Jan.</date> was to send a petition to Parliament. Neither the Society nor the movement was new; its new-found vigor followed on the success of the political reform movement and was among the major causes of the Disruption of <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> within the Scottish Church. The patronage objected to was the power of appointing ministers in many parishes throughout Scotland held by landowners or by the Crown.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-313" n="06:313"/>We had a Letter from Mrs Montague,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu had written in her letter to Jane of <date when="1833-01-02">2 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I went a few days since to see Edward Irving in his new House, in Newman Street, He was very glad to see me he looked dreadfully pale, and was much emaciated, but he seemed more tranquil than usual. He took me over his Chapel, which is beautifully fitted up,&#x2014;I knew it before, as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Wests picture gallery&#x2014;he has built, a place beyond, for visitors, pious Clergymen, Travellers &#x26;c containing six Bed rooms and a sitting room and the Front House is a very Handsome one, much better than the one you saw&#x2014; He has <hi rend="italic">taken upon himself</hi> a rent of 400&#xa3; a year &#x26; Taxes in proportion,&#x2014;while he is popular this may do&#x2014;but with this rent they must collect 1000&#xa3; at the Chapel to enable him to live at all&#x2014; I know not where all this will end&#x2014;.&#x201D; Benjamin West (<date when="1738-00-00">1738</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>), American painter, after a sojourn in Italy (<date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>&#x2013;<date when="1763-00-00">63</date>), established himself in London (<date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>). He succeeded his intimate friend Sir Joshua Reynolds as president of the Royal Academy, <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>, with a break in <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>.</note> who says she saw Edward Irving lately; that he has got a large meeting-house fitted up, close by his own dwelling, and has moreover built &#x201C;six bedrooms with a sitting room for the accommodation of pious clergymen and strangers&#x201D;! She calculates that he will need &#xa3;1000 a year of revenue; and knows not clearly what is to be done with him. I had also a Letter from Mrs Strachey,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> inquiring Lady Clare&#x2019;s address, for she had to write to Miss Morris<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></ref>.</note> the lady-companion of the Countess. The good Mrs S. is full of zeal and pious resignation: could my frank carry it, I would gladly send you her Letter.</p>
<p>But now, dear Mother, I think I have very fairly explained everything to you, and ought to go about my business. I fear poor Jean will have her own difficulties to make out my scribble this time; she must understand that I am again &#x201C;terribly off&#x201D; for a writing-table,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;teribly aff for a langitch,&#x201D; in <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271025-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:271</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1827-10-25">25 Oct. 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> but hope to be in better trim next time. Would she now but send me as faithful an account of Scotsbrig, especially of what and how <hi rend="italic">you</hi> do there. I am always anxious about you, as I well ought, my dear Mother; and more than usually in this brittle, unhealthy weather. I pray you again take every care of yourself; <hi rend="italic">as much</hi> care of yourself as you would of me: I can desire no more. Avoid damp feet, all kinds of cold. Study also, my dear Mother, to &#x201C;look on the bright side of thy cloud&#x201D;: God still mercifully spares us, to see good in the land of the living. Let us trust in Him, who never failed one that trusted: look round too on the warm hearts that still live to love you, and watch over you as you have faithfully watched over them. This is still the Place of <hi rend="italic">Hope:</hi> we were evil and unthankful to live in it gloomy and despondent.</p>
<p>Jean must write soon; let her take the smallest pen and the largest sh<supplied>[eet. I am]</supplied> much indebted to her writing, since Jamie will not.<pb id="pg-06-314" n="06:314"/>Jenny I expect will at least add <supplied>[a]</supplied> bit of a postscript. I suppose Austin has not yet fixed upon anything: I see farms enough advertised, but fear they do not suit; they are the Marquis&#x2019;s farms. I shall be anxious to learn what is determined on. Jamie and I were talking something about it, at Dumfries: doubtless he remembers.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> now again comes to me on Wednesday night: I will have it always lying ready at Ecclefechan on Saturday morning. To Alick I have promised the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> on Friday: so between you, you will see my hand twice weekly. I wish there was some such thing from you: however, I will hope, when I do not see.</p>
<p>Jane keeps her bed today, to subdue the <hi rend="italic">sniftering;</hi> she is otherwise very well, and still talks of writing to you all. It is now (and has been for the last two pages) the <date when="1833-01-12">28<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of the month</date>; a fine morning: and my Cold about gone. Nevertheless I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> taken the <hi rend="italic">Castor</hi>, to make good better. But now here is the end. Give our kind love to all, let all be assured of our continual love. And so God bless you and guard you, my dear Mother! <closer><salute>&#x2014;I am ever,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter of the <date when="1833-01-17">17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> January</date><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John&#x2019;s letter, begun on <date when="1833-01-14">14 Jan.</date>, had been continued on the 17th.</note> arrived four days ago; to my great satisfaction, for I had begun to get rather impatient about you; and indeed had it not been for the Scotsbrig Letter, notice of which was promptly communicated, I should have been seriously anxious. Let us be thankful that all hitherto, in spite of our hypochondrias, has gone well! We will, as you say, continue writing one a month, let the Letters &#x201C;overlap&#x201D; one another or not: eight weeks, with the accidents which might make it far longer, is too long to wait. Another Letter of mine dated here about a month ago, and I rather conjecture still another from Craigenputtoch (<hi rend="italic">after</hi> the Ecclefechan one) were upon <pb id="pg-06-315" n="06:315"/>the road when you wrote; but must now, we shall hope, be happily in your hands.</p>
<p>Comparing your last accounts with what sister Jane wrote me, I gather that there is nothing <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> as to Lady Clare&#x2019;s departure, and the length of your engagement with her: so whether to forecast seeing you this year, or not for another year, one cannot decide.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;Lady Clare has fixed to remain in Rome till the second week in <date when="1833-04-00">April</date> &#x26; then go to Florence. The main cause of this change is the weak health of her brother which would not admit of leaving Rome earlier in spring. We are to be his guests at Florence for a fortnight or so &#x26; then to go on towards the north. But much will depend upon Mr Burrel&#x2019;s state of health as well as Lady Clare&#x2019;s; &#x26; if the cholera should continue in England I think it were possible that both might spend another year in Italy as they have nothing that calls them home.&#x201D;</note> Neither indeed do I know what we ought to <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> about it, had we the fixing of it that way: another three hundred pounds, likely to be useful enough for your medical outfit, seems almost all the benefit a third year in Italy would yield; while, on the other hand, apart from the brotherly satisfaction of meeting you sooner, I cannot but desire to see you once fairly entered on what I call your permanent Future, and begun to work there. We will therefore the more readily leave it to Providence (which watches over the fall of a sparrow); and be as heretofore ready for <hi rend="italic">either</hi> way of it. Fear nothing, my dear Brother: I discern surer and surer symptoms of inward clearness and steadfastness being vouchsafed you; a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, who knows his own aim, and has once set his face towards it, bids farewell to Fear. Nothing in truth, can be better news to me than the tidings you, as it were indirectly, send me of your spiritual growth;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;Perhaps on the whole this is one of the strangest most perplexed letters you ever got from me. It has been written amid interruptions &#x26; distractions of various sorts. Pray take it in good part. It will at least assure you of my continued well being, &#x26; show you that I am struggling on in the best way my circumstances admit not without much hope &#x26; resignation &#x26; cheerfulness though with occasional darkness; with a knowledge of the duty which lies before me &#x26; a sincere wish to perform it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Die Zukunft will ich Gott &#xfc;berlassen</hi></foreign> [The future I will leave to God].&#x201D;</note> for the true force of a man lies in the spirit; it is thereby alone that he lives the slave of every accident, or walks forth invincible, be his outward accoutrement and wages whatsoever they may. Have Faith, then, have a sure Hope: Faith and Hope depend on no ancient Tradition believed or unbelieved; but are in all times in all places, the immediate gift of God to every faithful son of God. Rejoice too, if thro&#x2019; whatever horrid tribulation, you have attained or approximated that priceless possession of being faithful, of being true; a thing possible always, but <pb id="pg-06-316" n="06:316"/>in these days more difficult than for the last eighteen centuries it has been.&#x2014; To descend however, a little nearer Earth, I will assure you that the last Roman Letter seems to me one of the most comfortable I ever got from you. There is a soundness of judgement in it, a quiet honesty; and withal such a tolerance as I for one have great cause to envy. You see the working and wayfaring of your fellow creatures there; and, so far as there is profit in it, profit thereby; leaving the much there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> profit in simply to rest on its own basis, yourself, as is right and wise, passing quietly by on the other side. This is very good. We are also much gratified, as by a practical proof of your well-doing to learn that you have Patients; who trust in you, whom you are enabled to help. Caution I reckon the very first principle of true Medicine: nevertheless be not sceptical; much good <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be done, were the man there to do it; about all, remember to your comfort this aphorism of Richter&#x2019;s: &#x201C;the good Physician saves, if not from the disease, yet from the bad Physician!&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> This is a very true thing; a very important one too. My own distinct impression is that you have a real talent for Medicine; that you will, if God spare you alive, make it <hi rend="italic">known</hi> that you have such, and in a manful career of help-bringing see daily the clearest <hi rend="italic">fruits</hi> of such. I can wish you no higher blessedness: all the rest that is fit or necessary, will follow of itself. Persevere then, and prosper! The Future will bring us good, and evil which we may change into good. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Esperons!</hi></foreign></p>
<p>However, we must now quit Philosophy, and get a little of History. I have not been idle during the last month; tho&#x2019; not employed in the way I most approve of. Since the Article <hi rend="italic">Diderot</hi>, written in <date when="1832-10-00">October</date>, and not yet published, I have never put pen to paper, till last week when I began a Piece for Fraser to be entitled &#x201C;Cagliostro,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Count Cagliostro,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, VIII (<date when="1833-07-00">July</date>, <date when="1833-08-00">Aug. 1833</date>), 19&#x2013;28, 132&#x2013;55; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 249&#x2013;318. In his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> Carlyle wrote on <date when="1833-02-01">1 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Have been exploring on all hands the foolish history of the quack Cagliostro: have read several Books about him; searching far and wide after him; learned, I ought to admit, almost nothing. Shall I <hi rend="italic">study</hi> this enigma; then write my solution or no-solution?&#x201D;</note> I had found some Books about that Quack here: it will take me about three weeks; and do well enough as a <hi rend="italic">parergon</hi>. A new fluctuation has come over my mode of Publication lately; so that the things most at heart with me must lie in abeyance for some time. It begins to be presumable that the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> can no longer be my vehicle: for this reason, were there no other, that Napier is among the worst of <hi rend="italic">payers</hi>. What the poor man means I know not; most likely he is in <pb id="pg-06-317" n="06:317"/>utter <hi rend="italic">want of cash:</hi> but at any rate he needs to be <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> dunned before money will come from him; and at present owes me some &#xa3;30, for which a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> dunning will be requisite. This then simply will not do. We will look elsewhere; take new measures; as indeed solidity or permanence of any kind in Authorship is at this time not to be looked for; your foundation is like that of a man supporting himself in bog-lakes on floating sheaves or sods: the massiest will sink in a minute or two, and you must look out for new. Fraser whose Magazine I call the <hi rend="italic">mud</hi> one (in contradistinction to Tait&#x2019;s, or the Sahara-<hi rend="italic">sand</hi> one) is very fond of me, and at bottom an honest creature; Tait also would be glad to employ me; as poor Cochrane actually is: on the whole, as I told poor Murray the other day while he was advising and encouraging me, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Allah bis mallah</hi></foreign>, God is great; we shall find means!&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck</hi> cannot see the light this summer, tho&#x2019; I remain determined to spend a sixty pounds on him, when convenient: also, most probably, neither now nor at any other time will I treat again with Booksellers about such a matter. Suffering the <foreign>skaith</foreign> [damage], we may at least go without the scorn:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial: see M. L. Anderson, ed., <hi rend="italic">James Carmichael Collection of Proverbs in Scots</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1957-00-00">1957</date>), p. 67, proverb 457.</note> in the Bookseller, himself a condemned man, lies no help for us. Teufel<hi rend="italic">k</hi> (whom by the by I mean to call Teufels<hi rend="italic">dr&#xF6;ckh</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For a discussion of why Carlyle changed the name, see G. B. Tennyson, <hi rend="italic">Sartor Called Resartus</hi> (Princeton, <date when="1965-00-00">1965</date>), p. 152.</note>) is worth little, yet also <hi rend="italic">not</hi> worth nothing; I fancy there are from four to five hundred young men in the British Isles, whom he would teach many things; and sure enough, they, and not the <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>, shall have him. Glen, for example, read him thrice; Henry Inglis too (what is still stranger) has vehemently seized the meaning of him. So much for that.&#x2014; Meanwhile, I have been reading violently: about the Scotch Kirk (in <hi rend="italic">Knox</hi> and others); about the French Revolution (in <hi rend="italic">Thiers</hi>, which Mill sent me), about the Diamond Necklace, the Greek Revolt, and what not. I read with the appetite of one long starved; am oftenest of all in the Advocates&#x2019; Library, and dig not without result there. My head is never empty, neither is my heart, tho&#x2019; the contents of both are by times <hi rend="italic">rugged</hi> enough. They must even be elaborated; made smooth and sweet. I could write whole Volumes, were there any outlet; and will (if God spare me) both write them, and find an outlet. These Books I fancy will be one of our main conquests in Edinburgh.&#x2014; As to the men here, they are beautiful to look upon, after mere blackfaced Sheep; yet not persons of whom instruction, or special edification in any way, is to <pb id="pg-06-318" n="06:318"/><supplied>[be]</supplied> expected. From a Highlander you once for all <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be <foreign>breeckes</foreign> [trousers]. Sir W. Hamilton is almost the only <hi rend="italic">earnest</hi> character I find in this City; we take somewhat to each other; meet sometimes, with mutual satisfaction, always with good will. George Moir has got a house in Northumberland Street, a Wife too and infants; is become a Conservative, <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> every way into <hi rend="italic">Dilettante</hi>, not very happy I think, dry, civil, and seems rather to feel <foreign><hi rend="italic">unheimlich</hi></foreign> [uneasy] in my company. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Aus dem wird Nichts</hi></foreign> [Nothing will become of him]. Weir<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Weir (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>), called to Scottish bar, <date when="1827-01-27">27 Jan. 1827</date>; first edited the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Literary Journal</hi>, then the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Argus</hi>, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>; was on the editorial staff of the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> from <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>, and its editor, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>. Also, from <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date> he was prominently concerned with opposition to the Corn Laws.</note> has become a Radical spouter; and they say, is gone or going to Glasgow to start as &#x201C;able Editor.&#x201D; Did I tell you, by the way, that London-Spectator Douglas<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320114-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1832-01-14">14 Jan. 1832</date></ref>.</note> had come to Dumfries in that capacity; and was weekly emitting a Radical <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Times</hi> there? A company of malcontent writers and others had made a joint-stock for that end; it is feared, unsuccessfully. John Gordon is true as steel to his old loves; otherwise a rather somnolent man: we see him pretty often: he has got appointed College Clerk (or some such thing) lately; has now near three hundred a year, and is happy enough for the time. Mitchell is quiet, in very poor health, yet cheerful, hopeful even: a respectable Schoolmaster now and henceforth. I saw a large <hi rend="italic">didactic</hi> Company at dinner with him yesterday (for nothing else would satisfy him); and astonished them, I fear, with my expositions of Belief and Radicalism, as compared with Opinion and Whiggism. There was one &#x201C;old stager,&#x201D; a Doctor Brown,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. William Brown, lecturer in Logic and Rhetoric at the University of Edinburgh, and living (<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">35</date>) at 1 Howe St.; he is recorded as having been a secretary and president of the University&#x2019;s Dialectic Society, between <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date> and <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>.</note> Travelling tutor, College-lecturer, statist, geologist, spiritual scratcher and scraper in all senses: a cold, sharp, hard, unmalleable &#x201C;Logic Chopper,&#x201D; good to behold&#x2014;at rare intervals. There was also one Advocate Semple,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John William Semple (d. <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), of 8 Forres St., became the Solicitor General of St. Lucia, where he died.</note> an overfoaming Kantist, the best-natured and liveliest of small men; a very bottle of champagne (or soda-water) uncorked.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An expression applied to Ruskin later.</note> We did well enough.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">The</hi> Advocate came jigging up to us very often; but is now gone to London: he asked kindly for you, and desired to be kindly remembered to his &#x201C;old friend the Doctor.&#x201D; I dined with him once (Jane could 
<pb id="pg-06-319" n="06:319"/>not go) and met there a Mrs Fletcher<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Fletcher (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), leader of opinion who had been prominent in Edinburgh and in reforming Whig circles, and who was well known through her connections with Wordsworth and other writers.</note> (celebrated among <foreign>Litterateurs</foreign> here), whom we have since seen and liked: Dr Thomson<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly John Thomson (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), physician and surgeon, a friend of Mrs. Fletcher and of Jeffrey, professor of military surgery and general pathology at Edinburgh University. It is perhaps more likely, however, that Carlyle&#x2019;s slighting remarks are aimed at his son Allen (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), biologist, already a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons at Edinburgh, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>, and lecturing as an extra-academical tutor in physiology. He would be a closer comparison for John.</note> also, a mean poor kind of man. Look at <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, Doctor; and cease misgivings. Macvey Napier (besides his being &#x201C;forever in the small-debt Court&#x201D;!) is a man of wooden structure; limited in all ways: I do not dislike him, but feel that I can get no good of him. Wilson who is said to be grown far quieter in his habits, has only come athwart me once: he too, Lion as he is, cannot look at me, as I look at <supplied>[h]</supplied>im, with <hi rend="italic">free</hi> regard; but eyes me from behind veils, doubtful of some mischance from me, political or other: I suppose I shall see little of him; and at bottom need not care. I could tell you about other people enow: but here surely I ought to stop for once. As to our own special <foreign><hi rend="italic">Befinden</hi></foreign> [state of being], we are quite peaceable, content for the present; tho&#x2019; both of us have a dirty underfoot kind of catarrh for the last three weeks; whereby Jane in particular suffers considerable&#x2014;vexation rather than pain. Otherwise she is at least not worse: old Dr Hamilton<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. James Hamilton, Sr. (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), physician to the Royal Infirmary and George Heriot&#x2019;s Hospital, notably old-fashioned in manners, treatment, and dress, and said to be the last person who wore a three-cornered cocked hat. See the <ref target="volume-06/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12095"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>.</note> (of the cocked hat) attends her; really a sagacious-looking old fellow, whose procedure exterts [extorts?] even my approval; the rather, as he says, almost nothing can be done but what herself and Time are already doing. We &#x201C;go out&#x201D; not often, yet oftener than we wish; have society enough, the best the ground yields; the time for returning will <hi rend="italic">too</hi> soon be here. As I said last time, perhaps your final arrangement may throw some light on ours: for tho&#x2019; in the mean while there can be no thought of leaving Puttoch, I have not abated in my dislike for that residence, in my conviction that it is no longer good for me. Of solitude I have really had enough: you would be surprised, I am much surprised myself at the wondrous figure I often make when I rejoin my fellow-creatures. The talent of conversation, tho&#x2019; I generally <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> enough and to spare, has as it were quite forsaken me. In place of skilful adroit fencing and parrying, as were fit and usual, I appear <pb id="pg-06-320" n="06:320"/>like a wild monstrous Orson among the people, and (especially if <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi>) smash everything to pieces. The very sound of my voice has got something savage-prophetic: I am as a John Baptist, girt about with a leathern girdle, and whose food is locusts and wild honey.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 3:1&#x2013;4.</note> One must civilize; it is really quite essential: here too, as in all things, <hi rend="italic">practice</hi> alone can teach. However, we will wait, and watch; and do nothing rashly. Time will offer us much; Time and Chance happen unto <hi rend="italic">all</hi> men.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 9:11.</note> I have work for the present season; under conditions that I understand: let this suffice me.</p>
<p>Of the Annandale people I have still mostly good to tell you. Our Mother is well, and the rest of them: I have written to her twice; have bought her a <hi rend="italic">Thomas a Kempis</hi>, and mean to send it next week by Dumfries, with your Letter, and one from myself. Poor Alick has lost his infant son, in rather a stern way: his Wife awoke him one night with an exclamation that she &#x201C;did not hear the <foreign>bairn</foreign> breathing!&#x201D; The poor little creature was gone; they called the disease <hi rend="italic">Hives:</hi> I wrote to Alick too, comforting him as I could. You will find him very considerably improved when you return: his Farm seems to be quite tolerably prosperous; they are all doing, as times go, rather <hi rend="italic">well</hi>.&#x2014; I have now, thro&#x2019; Mill, got Badams&#x2019;s address (somewhere about Paddington<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >8, Old Church Street, Paddington.</note>), and will prevail on T. Holcroft to write me word how they are going on. Of Glen nothing for many weeks: I mean to write him a Note also someday. When you return to London, you must see Mill: he is growing quite a Believer <foreign><hi rend="italic">mystisch gesinnt</hi></foreign> [inclined to mysticism], yet with all his old Utilitarian Logic quite alive in him. A remarkable sort of man; faithful, one of the faithfullest (yet with so much calmness) in these parts. The Austins talk of going to live in Berlin; too poor for continuing in London. Mrs Montague wrote to Jane lately: she had been to see Irving (in Newman Street); he had fitted up &#x201C;five bedrooms and a sitting-room for strangers and pious clergymen,&#x201D; had a large audience, and was going on at a great rate. The Tongues perform here in Carrubers Close,<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Close is off the High St., on the north side, where there was evidently an Irvingite meeting-place.</note> but with smallest effect.

Dr. James Peddie in the chair. It defined its beliefs as that &#x201C;Civil Establishments of Religion are unjust, impolitic, and unscriptural&#x201D; and that &#x201C;the principal Evils of such Establishments are not accidental, but the necessary and unavoidable results of the compulsory support of Religious Institutions, and the alliance between Church and State.&#x201D; The society was one of the &#x201C;signs&#x201D; of the movement which was to lead to the Disruption of <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> within the Scottish Church.</note> organised itself here, the <pb id="pg-06-321" n="06:321"/>avowed aim of which is to root out Established Churches altogether. Peddie<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Peddie (<date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), licensed to preach in the Secession Church, <date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>, became minister of Bristo St. Secession Chapel in the same year, and was Moderator of the Associate Synod in <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date> and <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>.

No monument has been erected, a heap of mould is all that shows the place of burial. It says little for the surviving relations who have inherited the five thousand pounds yearly which he possessed that they paid so little attention to his memory. Rudolph is the oldest son, &#x26; he was grieved almost to crying on seeing the place where his uncle lay unhonoured.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; it will be a week and more before you receive this Parcel, I will not miss the opportunity of sending you a Line or two along with it, if merely to quiet your anxieties about us, which I judge will as usual err not in defect but in excess. Be of good comfort then, my dear Mother; nothing ails us: we are going on in the <hi rend="italic">usual</hi> way, better rather than worse.</p>
<p>This <hi rend="italic">Thomas &#xE0; Kempis</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas &#xE0; Kempis (Thomas Haemmerlein) (<date when="1380-00-00">1380</date>&#x2013;<date when="1471-00-00">1471</date>), German Augustinian monk and writer, author of <hi rend="italic">De Imitatione Christi</hi>. The edition here referred to is evidently <hi rend="italic">The Imitation of Christ in Three Books: by Thomas &#xE0; Kempis. Translated from the Latin by John Payne. With an introductory essay, by Thomas Chalmers</hi> (Glasgow, <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>).</note> I promised you at Craigenputtoch: it is a cheap edition, and I believe a tolerably correct one. No Book, I believe, except the Bible, has been so universally read and loved by Christians of all tongues and sects: it gives me pleasure to fancy that the Christian heart of my good Mother may also derive nourishment and strengthening from what has already nourished and strengthened so many. The Parcel comes by Thornhill, and then thro&#x2019; Watson and Notman; Jane is sending off some Miscellanies to her Mother, and I take advantage of the chance. I believe I can get you a <hi rend="italic">Cloud of Witnesses</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321119-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1832-11-19">19 Nov. 1832</date></ref>.</note> here too, on moderate terms, and should like to do it: but I know not whether it is this or the <hi rend="italic">Worthies</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.</note> that you already have. Tell Jean to by no means neglect informing me. Chalmers&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Kempis</hi> seems to me wholly, or in great part, a <hi rend="italic">dud</hi>. So much for our Book business.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-324" n="06:324"/>I hinted, on the Newspaper, that there was a Letter from Jack; this you now see before you: it will occupy Jean a good while, and very agreeably, in reading; I cannot but reckon it a very wise-looking comfortable Letter; of good promise for our poor Doctor&#x2019;s welfare inward and outward. That he has Patients shows him to be considered fit by those acquainted with him: there is indeed generally a tone of discretion and calm diligence in business with calm fervour in spirit, over the whole Letter; fair symptoms that my often-repeated prophecies about poor Jack will in due time be a realized <supplied>[fact]</supplied>. It now rather appears, I think, that the Lady Countess is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> for coming home this year; at least that this or the contrary is quite uncertain: one cannot well tell which to wish. We should be ready for <hi rend="italic">both</hi>. I wrote yesterday at great length to Rome; and mentioned among other things about Scotsbrig that you would soon have the last Roman Letter in your possession, and had safely received the former one.</p>
<p>This is a wretched <hi rend="italic">Pen</hi>, one can hardly even <hi rend="italic">spell</hi> with it;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March</date></ref></note> however, there is no help; you must just take matters, as <hi rend="italic">it</hi> will yield you them. Our Life in Edinburgh has now got in some measure familiar to us; we go on quietly, in weekday fashion, as if we were at home in it. Indeed, always from the first, the appearance of the place, as contrasted with the boiling uproar of London has seemed almost stagnant to me; there is no such thing as getting yourself properly <hi rend="italic">elbowed</hi> in a &#x201C;flood of life&#x201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Johnson&#x2019;s &#x201C;I think the full tide of human existence is at Charing-cross,&#x201D; Boswell, <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi>, Oxford Standard Authors, new ed. (London and New York, <date when="1953-00-00">1953</date>), p. 608, and Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi>, II, ii, 85.</note> the noise too (except that of the Watchmen while we slept in the front room) is quite trifling and inadequate. As for the people, they are now as formerly, all of <hi rend="italic">one sort;</hi> meet twenty of them in a day, they are all most probably talking of the same subject; and that mostly an insignificant one, and handled in an insignificant way. And yet, poor fellows, how are they to be blamed? It is &#x201C;more their misfortune than their crime&#x201D;;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle may have in mind Johnson&#x2019;s statement in <hi rend="italic">The Life of Richard Savage</hi> (4th paragraph) that Savage&#x2019;s &#x201C;misfortunes claim a degree of compassion, not always due to the unhappy, as they were often the consequences of the crimes of others, rather than his own.&#x201D;</note> what sense is in them they no doubt honestly exhibit. Some cheering exceptions too one now and then falls in with: indeed, for my own small share, I can nowise complain that honest sympathy, even love, and respect far beyond desert, is withheld from me here; this I receive with the greater clearness of appreciation that (hardened by long custom) I had from of old <hi rend="italic">learned</hi> <pb id="pg-06-325" n="06:325"/><hi rend="italic">to do without it</hi>. Nevertheless that also is a Mercy, and should be thankfully made use of. I think I have seen few new people of note since I last wrote: I met Wilson on the street one day, and exchanged civilities with him; he is looking a little older, was wrapt in a cloak for cold, and undertook to come and talk an hour with me, &#x201C;if I would allow him,&#x201D; the very first day he had leisure. I am glad we met, since now there need be no awkwardness or grudge between us; whether we meet a second time or not is of little or no moment. Henry Inglis has had my Book reading (the Manuscript one), and returns it with a most extatic exaggerated Letter; wherein this is comfortable, that he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> seized the drift of the Speculation, and can if he pleases lay it to heart. There are perhaps many such in this Island, whom it may profit; so that I stand by the old resolution to print at my own risk, so soon as I have &#xa3;60 to spare, but not till then.</p>
<p>Another piece of good news is that I am actually got to writing. There is a small thing I have signified to Fraser that I will finish for him against the end of this month; with which sullen determination, I accordingly <hi rend="italic">sit</hi> with pen in hand, whether much <hi rend="italic">come</hi> from it or little. It is to be the first fruits of my new <hi rend="italic">camp-desk:</hi> for after trying most of the tables in the house (as is my custom in new houses) I at length decided that a new Desk (from Trotter the great Upholsterer) were the best resource; and accordingly I now sit at one, coarse, strong, large, and very much what I wanted. If I here produce nothing but nonsense, the fault will be mainly my own.&#x2014; My other employment (and not amusement) is hunting out Books in the Advocates&#x2019; Library; where I find store of curious matters.</p>
<p>Jeffrey went away about a fortnight ago, &#x201C;to attend his parliamentary duties.&#x201D; They are making a <foreign><hi rend="italic">braw curbaudie</hi></foreign> [fine show] of it there; a jarring of vain loud words, when actions were so much wanted. I heard from Mill; and thro&#x2019; him, got Badams&#x2019; address, still in London, to whom I have despatched a Note of inquiry.&#x2014; Did I tell you that there was an <hi rend="italic">Anti-patronage Society</hi> (in which are many churchmen) formed here, having for object to abolish Patronage in the Church?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330127-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1833-01-27">27 Jan.</date></ref></note> I think, I did; but might have added that there was <hi rend="italic">another</hi> society set agoing, entitled the &#x201C;Church Society,&#x201D; of which Dr Peddie was President, the open aim of which is to do away with all Church Establishments whatsoever;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330210-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-02-10">10 Feb.</date></ref></note> and let every man pay his own priest; and I suppose pay him as he proves. The working men too <pb id="pg-06-326" n="06:326"/>(such as journeyman masons) are forming themselves into &#x201C;Unions,&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After the repeal of the Combination Acts, <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825-00-00">5</date>, trades unions were increasingly formed, including, for example, the United Operative Masons of Scotland, founded <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">33</date>.</note> for mutual protection, &#x201C;against the Masters,&#x201D; who again need protection almost equally if they are not to seek it in jail. I hear also that a number of people, among them some substantial shopkeepers and such like are about emigrating to America, which really seems one of the wisest determinations. It is a diseased Time; and <hi rend="italic">we</hi>, I prophecy, shall never see it mend. Well, if the third generation do!</p>
<p>To come far nearer home I must not neglect to say that our <hi rend="italic">Cold</hi> is gone its ways, tho&#x2019; I still for precaution wear a great-coat on the windy days, and both of us are very <hi rend="italic">dietetic</hi>, and refuse invitations wherever we conveniently can. Jane has her old Doctor still coming; seems not to be any worse than her usual Craigenputtoch way, in general I might rather say better. The Winter seems gone; but the weather as usual in this season is unwholesome, and many colds are noticeable. Jane talks of a ride to Haddington by and by; I rather think I shall stay and write. We hear from some people there that James Johnston is externally doing very well; but that himself and still more his Wife is in rather weak health. Whether at this special time they are improving or otherwise we do not learn. I daresay I ought to write to the worthy James, and try if he would come and see me.</p>
<p>But now really, in spite of my bad Pen, I think I have given you news enough: at all events <hi rend="italic">this</hi> sheet will hold little more. About <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, on the other hand, I am left to my own conjectures, which are not always of a quite flattering complexion. The time for Jean&#x2019;s writing will soon be here, and then I shall learn correctly; meanwhile I study to hope the best. My dear Mother, I beg you again and again to take care of yourself; especially in this wild gusty February weather; consider your welfare not as your own, but as that of others to whom it is precious beyond price. I hope they are all kind submissive and helpful to you; it well beseems them and me. Forgive them, if any of them offend; for I know well, no offence is intended; it is but the sinful infirmity of nature, wherein mortals should bear with one another. Oh! ought we not to live in mutual love and unity; as a thing seemly for men; pleasing in the sight of God! We shall so soon be parted; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> Happy is he who has <hi rend="italic">forgiven much!</hi>&#x2014; The Paper is done. God be with you all.</p>

The pressure of economical difficulty is rapidly augmenting; misery, of that and all kinds, is prevalent enough here; everything wears an uneasy, decaying aspect; yet far short of what strikes one in London.

Wilson I have not seen. Is he afflicted with my Radicalism? Is he simply too lazy to call on me; or indisposed to take the trouble of etiquette upon him, for object so little momentous?

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>This morning, which forms a sort of pause in certain small scriptory proceedings of mine, I devote of right to you. I might have written weeks ago, indeed, so far as occupation went; for nothing could be more ineffectual, languid, than my style of working (as I called it): however, a sounder sort of excuse remains for me in the grievance of ill health. For above two months, more especially since I came hither, a pitiful sneaking sort of catarrh has hung about me, strangely laming all my movements; these last few days, I am better again; but still in this, as in many other respects, must reconcile myself to grave impediments. &#x201C;They are soon <hi rend="italic">done</hi>,&#x201D; our Scotch Proverb says, &#x201C;who never <foreign><hi rend="italic">dought</hi></foreign> [were able, could]&#x201D; (<foreign>dowed, <hi rend="italic">taugten</hi></foreign>). But again the French say: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Il faut se ranger</hi></foreign> [it is necessary to settle down to business]. So without more Sanchoism,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Making proverbial remarks, like Sancho Panza in <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi>.</note> let us even get under way.</p>
<p>I really wish you would write to me oftener. Besides the comfortable, available intelligence your Letters bring, there is a most wholesome feeling of <hi rend="italic">Communion</hi> comes over me, in your neighbourhood; the agreeable memento: Thou art <hi rend="italic">not</hi> alone, then! Alas, it is a most solitary world; from Dan to Beersheba<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Judg. 20:1 and elsewhere.</note> you walk, and find nothing but <hi rend="italic">masks</hi>, a real Man is now almost as rare as a God has always been. One is ready to faint by the way, in that inane hubbub (<hi rend="italic">under</hi> which too lies Darkness and Death!); one longs for <hi rend="italic">speech;</hi> and there is but the (<hi rend="italic">subter</hi>natural) cackling and sniggering &#x201C;of imps in hellish wassail,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> of harpies at their foul <hi rend="italic">feed</hi> (the grand passion being <hi rend="small-caps">Hunger</hi>), intent only to <foreign><hi rend="italic">reave</hi></foreign> [talk irresponsibly] and <hi rend="italic">eat</hi>. Of all such my soul is exceeding sick; at times, even to loathing. In truth, it is oftenest a very <hi rend="italic">Temptation of St Anthony</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hermit (ca. <date when="0250-00-00">250</date>&#x2013;<date when="0350-00-00">350</date>), subject to legendary temptations.</note> with me; the inanimate <pb id="pg-06-329" n="06:329"/>Furniture of this Earth gets a ghastly ludicro-terrific vitality, the clothed Bipeds are mostly spectral,&#x2014;and the <hi rend="italic">Devil</hi> is at the bottom of it all. How pleasant the voice of a brother Eremite, a flesh-and-blood Reality (in better heart and health than yourself), at sound of whom the Devil and his works duck down into the Inane! Write to me, I pray you, with more and more heartiness; shew me your feelings as well as thoughts; and let us in all ways, while so much is permitted us, help one another as we can. &#x201C;What is cheerfuller than Light?&#x201D; says some one: &#x201C;Speech,&#x201D; is the answer. <hi rend="italic">Speech</hi>, however; not Cackle.</p>
<p>I cannot call myself disappointed in regard to Edinburgh, for it corresponds with my forecastings; yet I experience the pain and partial surprise of witnessing in detail the outline, vague and distant, fill itself up into palpable reality near at hand. It is a City this in which as little Wholeness exists as anywhere else. Sufficient Hodmen, here and there, we have; no Builder in any, even the smallest kind, can I yet meet with. Two thousand &#x201C;completed Bunglers,&#x201D; on the other hand, I will raise you in one day. The poor people cannot help it; neither can I; may God help them. For myself I am best pleased when I sit silent, which alas I can too seldom do; my utterances fall like red-hot a&#xEB;rolithes, or bursting bombs into the peaceful tea-garden of their existence, and they look upon me with astonishment and an incipient shudder. Alas, the <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> film that in these days divides all Bunglers from the everlasting Pool; and yet they still bungle,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; some of them now (what really is a progress) not without misgivings. On the whole I will predict that in this country, as in France, the movement, political and other, will proceed from the Capital. No Benthamite, or Islamite, or other even false Believer, exists here that I see: inummerable [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] respectable Whigs, that know not the right hand from the left, and desire of all things to eat their pudding in peace; numerous distressed, partially distracted Conservatives (they too are <hi rend="italic">numerous</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">washed</hi> classes); a small forlorn hope of half-rabid Cobbett Radicals, like the condemned vanguard of the Crusades led on by &#x201C;Walter the <hi rend="italic">Pennyless&#x201D;:</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Sans-Avoir or the Penniless (?&#x2013;<date when="1096-00-00">1096</date>), French leader of the first part of the Peasants&#x2019; or People&#x2019;s Crusade, which preceded the First Crusade and was destroyed by the Turks, <date when="1096-10-00">Oct. 1096</date>.</note> this is our condition in respect of Politics, whereby you may judge of us in others. Besides as respects Economics, Edinburgh, on the great highway towards <hi rend="small-caps">Ruin</hi>, seems to me full fifty years behind London; tho&#x2019; here too the progress appears constant; and indeed, within the last three years (this partly by accident), almost astonishing: in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> enviable posteriority itself, lies the surest <pb id="pg-06-330" n="06:330"/><foreign><hi rend="italic">vis inertiae</hi></foreign> [tendency to remain inactive]. We shall be quite quiet therefore (till others stir); and lament the decay of Law-practice (sunk last year to one <hi rend="italic">half</hi>, as is said, this year to one <hi rend="italic">third</hi>); and see the poor subsist on half-food, now and then <hi rend="italic">die</hi> of starvation; and execrate O&#x2019;Connel, <hi rend="italic">author</hi> of the whole storm (as Mother Carey&#x2019;s chicken is, with sailors);<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel O&#x2019;Connell: cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310817-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-17">17 Aug. 1831</date></ref>. &#x201C;Mother Carey&#x2019;s chickens&#x201D; was the sailors&#x2019; name for stormy petrels; the information may have recently caught Carlyle&#x2019;s eye in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1832-12-23">23 Dec. 1832</date>, p. 827.</note> and equalize the Church livings, and give the Reform Bill a <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> trial. Well and good.&#x2014; Meanwhile we have this to say of Edinburgh, that it feeds and clothes itself and produces young children enough; and so <hi rend="italic">keeps alive</hi>, if it do nothing else; and stands ready for a better day, should such dawn on it.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, I for my own small share must feel as if I had got into strange latitudes, and could not for these many months take any sure Lunar. The sneaking catarrh, as you may well judge, is no help to me. In truth, I am very considerably bewildered; few landmarks in the Earth, yet, God be thanked, some stars still shining in the Heavens: I can only say with the old Hebrew, in my own diale<supplied>[c]</supplied>t, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Still</hi> trust in God, for Him to praise good cause I yet shall have&#x201D;: so stood it in my Father&#x2019;s Psalm-Book;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Metrical Psalms, 43:4.</note> pity for me if so much stand not also in mine! On the whole, in this wondrous condition of all things, Literary, Moral, Economical, there is need of courage, of insight; which may the bounteous Heaven, withholding what else it will, supply according to our need. On one point, I am getting clearness: that it is not good for me to stay much longer in the Nithsdale Peat-desert. I will leave Craigenputtoch, before <hi rend="italic">very</hi> long: but where I shall settle; here, in London, or where, is as dark as may be. Poverty and a certain deep feeling of self-dependence (often named Pride, but I hope <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>named) complicate the matter much. We shall see. &#x201C;My son, before all thy gettings, get <hi rend="italic">understanding</hi>&#x201D;:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 4:5.</note> now as ever, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is verily the one thing needful. For the present, I think of waiting without much motion till my Brother the Doctor return from Italy; perhaps his place and mode of settlement may help to determine mine. John loves me with a brother&#x2019;s love; is a man of strong faculty, of the truest heart: it is really one of my <hi rend="italic">best</hi> joys of late to discern clearly that he too is fixing himself on the everlasting adamant, and <hi rend="italic">may</hi> front this Devil&#x2019;s-chaos beside me, also like a man. In thes<supplied>[e]</supplied> scandalous days, such a brother is a Treasure: alas, unless Nature have accidentally <pb id="pg-06-331" n="06:331"/><hi rend="italic">given</hi> it you, where shall you seek for Friendship? I often wonder over the love of Brothers, over the boundless capacity man has for Loving: why has this long-continued Baseness, Halfness and Hollowness so encircled him with cowardly distrusts that he <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> not love!&#x2014; You shall see John, were he once home; I imagine, some relation may spring up between you: at lowest, you will learn to respect each other.</p>
<p>But now I must answer you on the matter of these Books, while I have yet Paper. You will do me a real kindness, I think, by sending all of your French <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Saint-Albin Berville and Jean Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Barri&#xE8;re, eds., <hi rend="italic">Collection des m&#xE9;moires relatifs &#xE0; la Revolution Fran&#x26;ccedil;aise</hi>, 68 vols.

Mirabeau&#x2019;s ugliness<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Honor&#xE9; Gabriel Victor Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1791-00-00">91</date>), ninth portrait in vol.

<salute>My dear Glen,</salute>
<p>At parting from you last year, I had an expectation that you would sometimes write to me; tidings of your welfare and progress, you knew well, could not be other than welcome. You have not written: and truly, now when I consider of it, nothing doubting your love and regard, which I judge of by my own, I rather respect you <hi rend="italic">more</hi> for your silence.</p>
<p>I now despatch this hasty Line to assure you in words that Time and Distance have not at all diminished the interest I took in you; that I often figure your course there in that tumultuous Babylon; and long, yet with a sure hope, to learn that it is well with you. Worldly advancement, and renown, as you well understand, are not the things I covet for you: these will come of themselves, if they are to come; or can stay away, if they like that better: but the blessing of inward <pb id="pg-06-334" n="06:334"/>Clearness and Determination, that is a thing which I still keep prophecying for you, to which <hi rend="italic">all</hi> else that is good shall infallibly be added. Know then still that you have and retain a Friend here, who watches your walk and warfare with true friendly interest, and cherishes all manner of wishes and hopes for you. So much, under my hand and seal, I thought it right, now within year and day, to make written affidavit of. Farther the Deponent scarcely sayeth; except that a long deliberate Letter, explaining faithfully your temporal and spiritual whereabout, is now much desired; that in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> case where faculty of his can do you service, the shortest most undeliberate Letter ought to be trustfully sent forth. For the present I will but repeat my old motto: Fear nothing! The Devil, the World and the Flesh are powerful, but not all-powerful; there is in the spirit of <hi rend="italic">every</hi> True Man a force to subdue all these. I hope finally that you are getting <hi rend="italic">Ambition</hi> brought under (you are dreadfully ambitious); and learning the great lesson of &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Entsagen</hi></foreign> [renunciation]&#x201D;, a hard but a needful one, which men like you are specially called to learn, and help others to learn. In any case, pray resolve to tell me what you are about; in the candid historical style: it will do yourself too no harm.</p>
<p>We came hither, after eremitising in the Wilderness all Summer and Autumn about six weeks ago; with intent to see Men, if there were any such; at all events Books, for such we knew there were. We stay till <date when="1833-04-00">April</date>; then back again to the grim whinstones, there to commune with Time and Space, almost one&#x2019;s only company in those parts. I reckon it not unlikely that we may leave Craigenputtoch by and by; but how, when, or whither, all this is yet perfect mystery. If I break forth some day in Cockney-land, like some John Baptist, girt about with a leathern girdle, proclaiming anew with fierce Annandale intonation: &#x201C;Repent ye, ye cursed scoundrels, for&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 3:2,4.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c you will not think it miraculous. Alas, I know not yet how it will be; some way I think it shall and must be.</p>
<p>John Mill writes to me now and then, and seldom omits some kind news of you. For my sake, like Mill as well as you can: he is an honest man and loves you, and means well by you. We learn from him that you were in Scotland last autumn, and <hi rend="italic">missed</hi> Craigenputtoch; an omission we might justly take ill of you, but, as above hinted, do not. Your footstep in that hermitage had been a most joyful sound: behave more friend-like another time. I passed your Birthplace,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Birthplace not identified, but he was apparently a native of the Nether Craigenputtoch region, where he had been boarded out as a boy.</note> one day last <pb id="pg-06-335" n="06:335"/><date when="1832-08-00">August</date>: I was in one of my preternatural moods; the whole thing looks quite magical to me.</p>
<p>John is again in Rome, healthy, earnest, well; he has made many a friendly inquiry after you, which I answer according to ability. You may perhaps see him this Fall; possibly not too, for there is nothing fixed about it. His Patient is almost well. John himself seems to me in decided growth, and will become a Man one day; whether a famed Physician or not he begins to see is quite a secondary question.</p>
<p>Ask me not what I think of Edinburgh. The Advocates&#x2019; Library is full of good <hi rend="italic">Books,</hi> to which I have freest access. For the rest all is Scepticism, Dilettantism, Whiggism; nothing but oxen sheep and camels <hi rend="italic">grazing</hi> in their places. Peace be with them. In the bottom of Carrubbers&#x2019; Close,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330210-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-02-10">10 Feb.</date></ref></note> I understand, the gift of Tongues keeps up a faint inaudible Dissonance; there let it squeal <foreign><hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi></foreign> [as much as it pleases]. One Weir, a Tait&#x2019;s Magazine Advocate, slightly of my acquaintance, is gone to Glasgow, to edit some Radical <hi rend="italic">Argus</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The magazine Weir edited was called the Glasgow <hi rend="italic">Argus,</hi> <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">47</date>. See also <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330210-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-02-10">10 Feb.</date></ref></note> there: do you know anything of him or it? The Radicalism of Scotland is generally of most hunger-bitten character; a quite unproductive thing, as most other systems of opinion here are.</p>
<p>Have you learned German? Do you read Goethe yet. Begin it <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, if you have till now neglected it.</p>
<p>Mrs Carlyle has never yet recovered her health: however she is recovering it, seems to enjoy Edinburgh, much better than London. She sends you her kind remembrances, and hopes you have now given up &#x201C;the excessive anxiety to produce an effect on Society&#x201D;: these are her words.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And so God bless you! I remain always, / My Dear Glen, / Faithfully your Friend,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Last night, after tea, a Bookseller&#x2019;s Porter came in, with two Parcels; in one of which we found your two Books and your Letter;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1832-12-01">1 Dec. 1832</date> (pbd: Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH</hi>, XLV, 445&#x2013;47). The two books were Shelley&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Masque of Anarchy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Poetical Works of Leigh Hunt</hi> (London, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>). Hunt wrote, &#x201C;My book was out yesterday to subscribers. &#x2026; I am aware that a certain name is in the subscriber&#x2019;s list, &#x26; I am proud of my patron; but this copy comes to my friend.&#x201D;</note> both of which kind presents awakened the gratefullest feelings here. As for your Letter, written with such trustfulness, such patient, affectionate Hope, Faith and Charity, I must report truly that it filled the heart,&#x2014;in one of our cases even to <hi rend="italic">overflowing by the eyes</hi>. We will not dwell on this side of it. Let me rejoice rather that I do see, on such terms, such a Volume as yours. The free outpouring of one of the most purely <hi rend="italic">musical</hi> natures now extant in our Earth; that <hi rend="italic">can</hi> still be musical, melodious even in these harsh-jarring days; and out of all Discords and Distresses, extract Harmony and a mild Hope and Joy: this is what I call <hi rend="italic">Poetical</hi>, if the word have any meaning. Most of these Pieces are known to me of old; you may be sure, in their collected shape, I shall carefully prize them, and reperuse them, for their own sake and yours.</p>
<p>It was not till I had read your Letter a second or even third time, that I found the date of it to be the <date when="1832-12-02">2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi></date><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quite clearly <date when="1832-12-01">1 Dec.</date> in the MS.</note> of <date when="1832-12-02">December</date>! Where, whether at Moxon&#x2019;s, or at Longman&#x2019;s the Parcel may have laind [sic] hid these three months can only be conjectured: I had determined in any case to write by return of Post; and now, on that vexatious discovery, had almost snatched my pen, to write before I went to sleep; as if that could have got you word a little sooner. It is very provoking; and to me at the moment doubly so, for a cheerful illusion was dispelled by it.</p>
<p>Alas, then, it is too likely that sorrowful Paragraph we read in the Newspapers was <hi rend="italic">true;</hi> and the modest hopes your Letter was to impart to me were all misgone before its arrival!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> had been a bad year for Hunt, and the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> by subscription had been set on foot, with the help of friends, to relieve him from financial difficulties. He explained that &#x201C;in the course of a week&#x201D; he hoped &#x201C;to be taken out of the worst possible situation.&#x201D; The particular paragraph in the newspapers has not been traced.</note> Would I could help <pb id="pg-06-337" n="06:337"/>you. Tell me at least without delay, how it stands; that we may know if not what to do, at least what to wish. Meanwhile I again preach to you: Hope!</p>
<p>&#x201C;Man,&#x201D; says a German Friend of mine whom I often quote, &#x201C;is properly speaking founded upon Hope; this world where he lives is called the <hi rend="italic">Place of Hope</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 158&#x2013;59, where Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh says: &#x201C;Man is, properly speaking, based upon Hope, he has no other possession but Hope; this world of his is emphatically the &#x2018;Place of Hope.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Time and Chance, it is written, happen unto <hi rend="italic">all</hi> men.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 9:11.</note> Your good children, now like frail young plants, your chief care and difficulty, will one day stand a strong hedge around you, when the Father&#x2019;s hand is grown weary, and can no longer toil. Neither will the sympathy of kind hearts, so far as that can profit, ever fail you. <foreign>Esperaunce</foreign>!</p>
<p>I too am poor, am sick; and, in these wondrous chaotic times, dispirited; for moments, nigh bewildered. Let us study to hold fast and true even unto the death; and ever among the Sahara sands of this &#x201C;wilderness journey,&#x201D; to look up towards loadstars in the blue still Heavens! We were not made to be the sport of a Devil or Devil&#x2019;s Servants: my Belief is that a <hi rend="small-caps">God</hi> made us, and mysteriously dwells in us.</p>
<p>However, let us now turn over to a more terrestrial leaf, and talk of this journey to Craigenputtoch, which we here cannot consent to abandon. It is not a piece of empty civility, it is a firm scientific conviction on my Wife&#x2019;s part and mine that you would both get and give true pleasure in our Nithsdale Hermitage. She says emphatically, I must <hi rend="italic">press</hi> you to come. You shall have her Pony to ride; she will nourish you with milk new from the Galloway Cow; will &#x26;c &#x26;c. In sober prose, I am persuaded it would do us all good. You shall have the quietest of rooms the <hi rend="italic">firmest</hi> of writing-desks: no soul looks near us more than if we were in Patmos: our day&#x2019;s work done, you and I will climb hills together, or saunter on everlasting moors, now cheerful with speech; at night the Dame will give us music; one day will be as peaceable and diligent as another. Why cannot you come? The way thither, and back again, is the simplest. You embark at your Tower Wharf in a Lieth [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Ship (Smack it is called); where under really handsome naval accommodation, sailing along shores which <pb id="pg-06-338" n="06:338"/>grow ever the finer, and from Flamborough Head onwards can be called beautiful, you land at Leith; say, after a voyage of four days; the whole charge Two pounds Sterling. An Omnibus takes you to the inn-door, whence that very night, if you like, a Coach starts for Dumfries; and seventy miles of quick driving brings you safe into my old Gig, which in two hours more lands you at Craigenputtoch house-door; and you enter safe and <foreign><hi rend="italic">toto divisus orbe</hi></foreign> [cut off from the whole world]<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Eclogue I</hi>, 66.</note> into the oasis of the Whinstone Wilderness. Or there is another shorter daylight way of getting at us from Edinburgh; which a Letter of mine could be lying here to describe and appoint for you. Will nothing be temptation enough? Nay, we are still to be here till the first week of <date when="1833-04-00">April</date>; could lodge you in this hired Floor of ours, show you Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and take you home with us ourselves. You must really think of this; Mrs Hunt, for your sake, will consent to make no objection; your writing work, one might hope, would proceed not the slower but the faster. You see two Friends; innumerable stranger Fellow-men, and lay in a large stock of impressions that will be new, whatever else they be.</p>
<p>As for the projected Book-parcel, fear not to overburthen me with Books:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt had asked how large a packet of books he might venture to send.</note> at home, I am quite ravenous for these. Fraser (Magazine Fraser) the Bookseller of Regent Street will take charge of anything for me, and have it forwarded; at the utmost, for five-pence per pound. Or perhaps your better way (if the Colburns are punctual people) were to direct any Parcel simply &#x201C;to the Care of Messrs Bell &#x26; Bradfute, Edinburgh&#x201D; (with whom they <hi rend="italic">infallibly</hi> communicate every Magazine-day), by whom, also at the lowest rate, such as themselves pay, it will be carefully forwarded.</p>
<p>My Paper is nigh done; yet I have told you little or nothing of our news. The truth is happily there is almost none to tell. Mrs Carlyle is still sickly, yet better than when you saw her; and rather seems to enjoy herself here,&#x2014;almost within sight of her birthplace. For me I read Books and scribble for better for worse. We left home some two months ago, once more to look at Men a little. The style of thought and practise here yields me but little edification; as indeed any extant style thereof does not yield one much.

<p>This sheet comes to you under cover to the Lord Advocate. If he call on you some day with a card of mine, you will give him welcome.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your &#x201C;Quack of Quacks&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Count Cagliostro.&#x201D;</note> is actually under way (sixteen Pages of him <hi rend="italic">written</hi>); but has been fearfully kept back by colds, by visits, by accidents of all kinds. He can hardly be ready &#x201C;before the <date when="1833-03-15">fifteenth</date>&#x201D;; so, for this Number, must not be depended on.</p>
<p>Here are five pages of Philosophic stuff,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Printed in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, VII (<date when="1833-05-00">May 1833</date>), 585&#x2013;89, as &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Quae Cogitavit</hi>&#x201D; and reprinted as &#x201C;On History Again&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 167&#x2013;76.</note> which I send you in the interim, having opportunity. If you like them send me a Proof-sheet (folded as Post-Letter in the way you know): I will try to have <hi rend="italic">Cagliostro</hi> ready to return with it, and save carriage. C. is going to be a very queer fellow<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I used to know De Quincey<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1833-02-13">13 Feb.</date> Fraser had written to Carlyle: &#x201C;As you are in Edin, If you know De Quinc<supplied>[e]</supplied>y may I ask a favour of you? Sometime (full 6 months) he wrote to me offering his assistance<supplied>[.]</supplied> I instantly accepted of it &#x26; agreed to his terms&#x2014;since then&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I have written to him once or twice I have not heard from him &#x26; now I begin to think that there must be some cause for this strange conduct if you would ask him &#x26; endeavour to fathom it I should esteem it a most particular favour.&#x201D;</note> rather well: he is here in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; but none of his Friends can see him by calling, he has hardly shewn face for the last two years; and is at present wholly occupied getting out <pb id="pg-06-340" n="06:340"/>what we in Scotland call a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Cessio Bonorum</hi></foreign> [something to satisfy his creditors];<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Scottish law a legal process whereby a debtor may escape imprisonment if he surrenders all his means and is innocent of fraud.</note> that is to say, a surrendering of all earthly property to <hi rend="italic">avoid going to Jail!</hi> That he has not written for you, or to you, will in these circumstances no longer surprise. I mean to attempt seeing him before I go; and if I have opportunity shall mention your affair.</p>
<p>As to the Independent Pittite&#x2014;&#x2014; But I have no moment to spare at present.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The article referred to is &#x201C;An Englishman&#x2019;s Remonstrance to the Whig Aristocracy,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, VII (<date when="1833-02-00">Feb. 1833</date>), 127&#x2013;36, signed &#x201C;An Independent Pittite.&#x201D; Fraser&#x2019;s reply is clearly in answer to a letter from Carlyle (before <date when="1833-02-13">13 Feb.</date>) criticizing this article.</note></p>
<p>Let me not forget to add that we are changing our House; the address after Monday first<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1833-03-11">11 March</date>.</note> will be: &#x201C;4. Great King-Street, Edinburgh.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It would have been hard to conjecture how the flight of <hi rend="italic">Sapio</hi> the Singer<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Antonio Sapio (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), tenor who made his d&#xE9;but in the <hi rend="italic">Messiah</hi> in <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>; see James D. Brown and Stephen S. Stratton, <hi rend="italic">British Musical Biography</hi> (Birmingham, <date when="1897-00-00">1897</date>), p. 363. He was singing in various concerts in Edinburgh <date when="1833-01-00">Jan.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-02-00">Feb. 1833</date>, when the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> reported (<date when="1833-01-19">19 Jan.</date>) that he was &#x201C;a just acquisition to the Edinburgh concerts.&#x201D; No public notice of his actual bankruptcy has been traced, and this may be Jane&#x2019;s exaggeration.</note> to the Abbey could produce any perceptible effect on the destinies of Thomas Carlyle and his amiable and excellent wife! Yet so strangely are things woven and warped together in this world&#x2014; We who never saw M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Sapio with our eyes, or heard him with our ears are proved to have had a lively interest in his running in debt&#x2014; the consequence of which has been his running to the Abbey<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The precincts of Holyrood Abbey were a debtors&#x2019; sanctuary.</note>&#x2014; and the <pb id="pg-06-341" n="06:341"/>consequence of his running to the Abbey has been the evacuation of a furnished house belonging to my old schoolfellow M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Blacky&#x2014; and the consequence of the evacuation of the furnished house, has been an offer on the party of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Blacky of the said house to me at any rent I liked&#x2014; and the consequence of the offer has been my acceptance of the same&#x2014;and thus thro the intervention of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Sapio or rather, to go to the root of the matter, of the Devil who tempted M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Sapio&#x2014;we find ourselves on the eve of removing to No 4 Great King Street&#x2014;with the blessed prospect of remaining in Town two months longer than the appointed time&#x2014;and what may be the consequence of our remaining so long&#x2014;no Mortal can predict!</p>
<p>Our charming young friend up stairs has been creating such an infernal disturbance of late that we were resolved should any resourse [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] present itself to leave her the house to herself&#x2014; Accordingly, so soon as I had heard of and seen the Kingstreet floor and found that we <hi rend="italic">could make it do</hi> I dispatch<supplied>[ed]</supplied> a highly diplomatic note to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Colquhoun stating our grievance and &#x201C;making no doubt that she would allow our agreement to terminate at the end of the present week.&#x201D; The Lady called next day&#x2014;I was out but Carlyle received her&#x2014;she was in the most accommodating mood&#x2014;&#x201C;we were quite at Liberty to leave whenever it suited us&#x201D;&#x2014; She made no secret of her participation in the Matter&#x2014;&#x201C;She was quite aware of the night-noises&#x201D; &#x201C;Had left the house in consequence of having such disagreeable and disreputable Neighbours!&#x201D; So you and I know what to do dear when we happen to have a house we can no longer occupy ourselves&#x2014;just swear it is all right and tight and let it to some innocent third party&#x2014;</p>
<p>No further word from Templand&#x2014;I wrote again today&#x2014; It is not so much matter now <hi rend="italic">when</hi> she<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her mother.</note> comes&#x2014;but no thanks to her for the respite.</p>
<p>We are invited to dine at your Cousins John&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> on Friday&#x2014; I must send an apology to the Thomson&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly one of the Thomsons referred to in <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330210-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-02-10">10 Feb.</date></ref></note> tonight&#x2014; I have been very ill for two days. on Thursday Night the pain in my head was so intense that I fainted entirely away under it&#x2014;</p>
<p>But &#x201C;it will not be permanent&#x201D; as Carlyle tells me&#x2014; as if I could fancy it would be permanent without instan<supplied>[t]</supplied>ly cutting my throat&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am sorry to leave this sweet neighbourhood and nice well aired house&#x2014; But &#x201C;what could the fellow do Sir&#x201D;?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> just that night I was so ill&#x2014; there was a bacchanalian party over me till three in the Morning<supplied>[.]</supplied> <pb id="pg-06-342" n="06:342"/>I wonder if M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Sapio has left any bugs behind him? that is my next terror&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>A certain Bishop says, &#x201C;Hell is paved with good resolutions&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Familiar maxim attributed to St. Bernard of Clairvaux; see also Boswell, <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi>, p. 624.</note> so I will resolve no more; but proceed forthwith, tho little more than half my day&#x2019;s-work is done, and <hi rend="italic">execute</hi>. The day before yesterday I <pb id="pg-06-343" n="06:343"/>waited till it was all done, and tea had come, thinking confidently I might still manage: but scarcely were the first three lines written, when John Gordon entered; sat humming and drumming for above two hours; the consequence of all which was that not only did your Letter remain barely begun, but the very Newspapers proved too late for the Post, and yesterday both you and Alick would be disappointed. On the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, however, was written &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Tomorrow</hi>&#x201D;; and this time I will keep my word.</p>
<p>Jean&#x2019;s most welcome Letter is grown old now: however, I had one from Alick<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1833-03-14">14 March</date>.</note> this morning, and happily all was well. When the Postman rung, I knew by the hour that it must be from Annandale, and waited not without apprehension (for I was in a poor, apprehensive, bilious kind of humour): God be thanked that it all proved otherwise. The Thornhill Book-packet, written unluckily the day <hi rend="italic">before</hi> Jean&#x2019;s Letter came, could not be an answer to it; so that properly it was my turn to write; they were entitled therefore to hold their <foreign><hi rend="italic">kippage</hi></foreign> [confusion] (which Alick says you were objecting to), and go to their wedding while they had opportunity.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander had written: &#x201C;When I last saw our mother she was lamenting that she could not get Jean to write owing to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kippage</hi></foreign> they were in about preparing to attend Samuel Aitken&#x2019;s marriage to Jean Grier whom you may perhaps recollect of seeing.&#x201D; He added that the wedding was to have taken place &#x201C;last Friday&#x201D; and identified Samuel as the younger brother of James Aitken, future husband of Jean Carlyle.</note> I suppose it all over now; and probably the most ineffectual pair that ever in this century went together, established &#x201C;on some pendule of land under the eye of little Grier,&#x201D; looking out into the future with hope. May it prove happy for them, poor things! &#x201C;Better a <foreign>wee</foreign> bush than <foreign>nae bield</foreign> [protection].&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial. Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220407-TC-JAC-01"><sic>2:80</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1822-04-07">7 April 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note> But, <foreign>Bairns</foreign>, as I have often said, I now repeat, If any of you mean to change your life, <hi rend="small-caps">do nothing rashly</hi>! It is a fearful sort of thing; that will never in this world be revoked: see that ye be sure, and doubly sure, about all sides of it.</p>
<p>You may see by the date of this that we have changed our abode. The Stockbridge house, very comfortable in several respects, was grievous enough in one: Loud noises overhead, occasionally at very late, or rather very early hours. In these narrow Trough-beds there was small chance of sleep then; that is, perhaps once or twice a-week. To mend the matter, my good Wife with the restless curiosity natural to the female sex left no stone unturned till she discovered what it could originate from. What think you? With favour be it spoken, a <pb id="pg-06-344" n="06:344"/>woman, carrying on her trade there, no <hi rend="italic">better than she should be!</hi> The consequence was we searched out this house (belonging to an old school-companion of the Dame&#x2019;s), and getting it offered for the same rent, we made off without loss of time. The dishonourable Mrs Colquhoun, detected in her dishonesty (for it was like passing a bad shilling), could make no objection to our removal: so we landed on Monday night last; have now a capital bed, with the steadiest inaudible old Bachelor overhead, rooms much better furnished if a trifle smaller; and are like to be as comfortable as need be. I think you and Jean must both remember Great King Street: it was some years ago reckoned the finest street in all Edinburgh; we went along it from the Circus, going to John Gordon&#x2019;s (where I think you once were); our house is the very corner one (the <hi rend="italic">northeast</hi> corner), looks two ways into broad free spaces; the second story from the ground: this will make you at home with us again. We can, if we like, stay here till Whitsunday; and do talk of perhaps seeing the May-dew fall.</p>
<p>I had begun a kind of scribblement, and was in the very heart of it, when this flitting nigh overset me; indeed ever since, with cleaning carpet-lifting and what not I am bundled about at a great rate, and sit no two days in one room: however I do sit, and generally perform my length; so that the thing <hi rend="italic">must</hi> end itself in the course of next week. It is for Fraser; a foolish story about a certain Italian &#x201C;King of Quacks,&#x201D; whom I have long been curious about, and am now going to make known to all the world,&#x2014;for some forty guineas, if I can get them. You will see it in time. The long piece I did on the Frenchman<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Diderot.&#x201D;</note> in summer came to be corrected very lately; it also will soon be out, and I hope give satisfaction at Scotsbrig. I have plenty of other things to write; but should now rather lay myself out for getting Books and materials: Craigenputtoch is the place for writing. This same &#x201C;King of Quacks&#x201D; ought to pay our expenses here and back again: I am growing little richer; yet also no poorer; the <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> can hardly be printed this season, but one ought to be content. I really am rather content: the rather as I do not imagine there is any completer <hi rend="italic">Anti-Gigman</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240121-TC-JAC-01"><sic>3:16</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1824-01-21">21 Jan. 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> extant in the whole world at present.</p>
<p>As for the people here they are very kind, and would give us three &#x201C;dinners&#x201D; for one that we can eat: otherwise I must admit them to be rather a barren set of men. The spirit of Mammon rules all their world; Whig, Tory, Radical, all are alike of the earth earthy:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Cor. 15:47.</note> they look upon <pb id="pg-06-345" n="06:345"/>me as a strong well-intending, utterly misguided man, who must needs run his head against posts yet. They are very right: I shall never make any fortune in the world; unless it were that highest of all conceivable fortunes, the fortune to do, in some smallest degree, my All-wise Taskmaster&#x2019;s bidding there.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></ref>.</note> May He, of his great grace, enable me! I offer up no other prayer. Are not my days numbered: a span&#x2019;s length in the sea of <hi rend="small-caps">eternity</hi>? Fool is he who would speak lies, or act lies, for the better or worse that can befal him for that least of little whiles. I say, therefore, Lie away, worthy brethren, lie to all lengths, be promoted to all lengths; but as for me and my house<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Josh. 24:15.</note> we will not lie at all. Again I say: God enable us! and so there it rests.&#x2014; Ought not my Father&#x2019;s and my Mother&#x2019;s Son to speak even so?<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> on <date when="1833-03-15">15 March</date>:
<p>&#x201C;Beautiful spring day; the season of Hope! My scribble prospering very <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>. Persevere, and thou wilt improve. Sir W. Hamilton&#x2019;s supper (three nights ago) has done me mischief; will hardly go to another. Wordsworth talked of there (by Capt T. Hamilton, his neighbour). Represented verisimilarly enough as a man full of English prejudices; idle, alternately gossiping to enormous lengths, and talking, at rare intervals, high wisdom; on the whole, endeavouring to make out a plausible life of <hi rend="italic">Halfness</hi> in the Tory way, as so many on all sides do. Am to see him if I please to go thither; would go but a shortish way for that end.</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Had thou any Plan, eve<supplied>[n]</supplied> for what is nearest; for the coming Summer? Form one; arrange the dim rudiments of one already within thee. With the <hi rend="italic">Pen</hi> no work of moment can be done in this environment.&#x2014; Many Books ought now to be looked into.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The brevity of life; the frightful voracity of <hi rend="small-caps">time</hi>! This is no fancy; it is a wondrous unfathomable reality, and daily grows more wondrous to me. &#x2018;Poor is what my lord doth <hi rend="italic">say&#x2019;:</hi> let him to work, then.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Beautiful that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> here and now am <hi rend="italic">alive!</hi> Beautiful to see many Incorporated Spirits, all six feet high (as in the oldest heroic ages), all full of force, passion, impetuosity, mystery, as at the first. &#x2018;The young new blood!&#x2019; it flows and flows: the Spirit Host marches unweariedly <hi rend="italic">on</hi>. Whither? [Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 266&#x2013;67.]</p>
<p>&#x201C;Is not <hi rend="italic">every</hi> misery simply a Problem set for the &#x2026; to Master? &#x2026;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Am very sick; have not for so many years been so long plagued as now with a pitiful rooted continuous sneaking kind of <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>.&#x2014; &#x2018;Cagliostro&#x2019; almost getting desperate. To it, however.&#x201D;</p></note></p>
<p>Among the new figures I have seen, none attracts me in any measure; except perhaps Knox&#x2019;s Dr M&#x2019;Crie,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Thomas M&#x2019;Crie: see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210300-TC-MAC-01"><sic>1:335</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1821-03-01">1 March 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> whom I mean (as he rather pressingly invited me) to go and call on, were I a little at leisure. A broad, large, stiff-backed, stalking kind of man; dull, heavy, but intelligent and honest: we spoke a little about Scotch Worthies and Martyrs, and I mean to ask him more. My notion of writing a Book on that subject rather grows than decays. We get Letters enough <pb id="pg-06-346" n="06:346"/>from London: very affectionate from Mill; from poor Leigh Hunt (a ruined Poet), from Jeffrey &#x26;c There was one even from Badams;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Postmarked <date when="1833-03-04">4 March</date>, saying that he was &#x201C;suffering Torture with Quinsy.&#x201D;</note> but of the briefest: I grieve to understand that poor B. is decidedly taking to <hi rend="italic">Brandy</hi>, and in great danger that way of utter ruin. His Wife unhappily cannot hinder but rather help: one might wish even that they would part, and go each his way. Poor Badams! Yet while there is Life there is Hope. From the Doctor I hear nothing more; but am now expecting ere long to hear.</p>
<p>Now, however, we must turn to the other side. If I tell you that our health is very much what it was (the old Doctor still coming about Jane, but professing his inability to help her much), I think there is a very copious picture of our condition here. As for you, my dear Mother, Alick would persuade me that you are in the usual way; &#x201C;resigned wonderfully, and even contented.&#x201D; He says, &#x201C;it is only after having had something <supplied>[to]</supplied> do with this world that one can learn rightly to love and reverence such a life as hers.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Be</hi> resigned, my dear Mother: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">still</hi> trust in God&#x201D;; He will not leave us, nor forsake us; not in Death itself, nor in aught that lies between us and Death. On <hi rend="italic">our</hi> love moreover count always as on a thing yours by good right: the longer I live the more I feel how good is your right. Let us hope then to find you well, in the early days of <date when="1833-05-00">May</date>, if not sooner; once again in this Pilgrimage to meet in peace. Might we but meet in peace, where there is parting no more! This also, if it be for good, will be provided us. God is great; God is Good!&#x2014; The rest I fancy to be busy in their several vocations: the men sowing; in which work I hope a little &#x201C;March Dust&#x201D; is not denied them.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A dry March is proverbially good for sowing: &#x201C;A peck of March dust is worth a King&#x2019;s ransom&#x201D; (English); &#x201C;A peck of March dust and a shower in May / Makes the Corn green, and the Fields gay&#x201D; (Scots).</note> Tell Jean <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to take offence at me for not writing; nay I will write to her (with all the seriousness in the world) before many days go. Alick hints that she has great things in her eye.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick had written: &#x201C;Jean it is said will have the painter [her cousin James Aitken], right or wrong, and preparations are being made for her reception at whitsunday. It is my full conviction that she should be advised in this most important matter&#x2014;advised at least to delay. She has no one now whose advice has any weight with her but your own. Our mother, tho&#x2019; she forbares to speak with her on the subject, and indeed the whole of us except Jamie are any thing but satisfied with the prospect. I would be loath to rec<supplied>[k]</supplied>on the painter altogether a dishonest person, tho&#x2019; his conduct unfortunately furnished very questionable instances<supplied>[.]</supplied> In short the honesty and morality of the Dumfries tradesmen has I confess left a painful and melancholy impression on my mind which time will not easily eradicate.&#x201D;</note></p>
    <p>Hoho! Here at this point comes again a &#x201C;double ring,&#x201D; and the <pb id="pg-06-347" n="06:347"/>Postman hands me in two Letters; one of which is from John! He dates <date when="1833-02-28">28<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Actually dated <date when="1833-02-27">27</date> and <date when="1833-02-28">28 Feb.</date> Writing from Rome, John said that Lady Clare&#x2019;s group would probably leave for Florence on <date when="1833-04-08">8 April</date> and after a fortnight there proceed by way of Innsbruck, Strasburg, Paris, and Boulogne to Dover, which he hoped to reach by the end of <date when="1833-06-00">June</date>. He added, however, that if Mr. Burrell&#x2019;s health was too bad or if the cholera reappeared in London the plan to return to England would have to be given up. In a postscript he added: &#x201C;Gustave d&#x2019;Eichthal is come to Rome as his cousin told me he would. I see little of him &#x26; that little is not very profitable to me. He has now no connexion with the S<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Simonian&#x2019;s [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] &#x2018;family affairs&#x2019; having separated him from them. He looks extremely sad &#x26; worn. He was diligent in his enquiries about you, &#x26; says that he has found the truth of what you told him in London about the S<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Simonians being more religious than their founder. He is &#x2018;most ready for &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Reverence</hi>&#x201D; if he could find anything to revere.&#x2019;&#x201D; John also says that he has seen &#x201C;Hare of Cambridge known as the translator of Niebuhr.&#x201D; For Julius Charles Hare, who with Connop Thirlwall published a translation of Barthold Georg Niebuhr&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of Rome</hi> in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291222-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1829-12-22">22 Dec. 1829</date></ref>, and the <ref target="volume-06/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12304"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>.</note> is very well; <hi rend="italic">expects</hi> now to be in Britain by the next month of <date when="1833-06-00">June</date>; that is, only three months hence. It depends, he says, altogether on Mr Burrel&#x2019;s getting strong enough for travel; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is for England as soon as possible, and Lady Clare will not leave him. Jack says: &#x201C;I was greatly interested with what you write about my Mother&#x201D; (I forget what it was; some truth doubtless). &#x201C;Tell her I think she may expect to see me this summer. I may find an opportunity of writing to her again before leaving Rome.&#x201D;&#x2014; But I need not quote: for I will make up a Book-parcel; next Tuesday if possible; certainly the week after next (<hi rend="italic">that</hi> I think will do better); and you will see the whole, with letters for yourselves too, at your leisure. So no more at present.&#x2014; Let me add however that we expect Mrs Welsh and her Niece Helen (from Liverpool) to be with us on Monday: they talk of staying a very short while, but may perhaps prolong it. Mrs W. has succeeded in getting her ground let, and retains the House: I think, she gets &#xa3;35 rent; much less than she expected: yet still the place is cheap enough (&#xa3; 10 for such a house and garden).&#x2014; Here comes Jane in, with news that at a sale of pictures (belonging to the late Lord Eldin), <hi rend="italic">two floors</hi> of the house have <hi rend="italic">fallen in</hi> (half an hour ago), and of course many persons are lamed, perhaps some killed! I hope it will prove exaggerated; perhaps even untrue.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The accident happened as Jane reported, when many were injured though only one person was killed.

Will you allow me, dear Sir, to send him to you for a week or two, as my substitute? &#x2026; He is capable of deriving knowledge from you, &#x26; I think, of contributing his share of reasonable entertainment as a guest&#x201D; (Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH</hi>, pp. 450&#x2013;51).

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Will you accept this feeblest Apology for a Letter, and write to me again, till I have time to answer you more deliberately.</p>
<p>You do your nature great injustice,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written in his letter of <date when="1833-03-09">9 March</date>: &#x201C;Truly I do not wonder that you should desiderate more &#x2018;heartiness&#x2019; in my letters, and should complain of being told my thoughts only, not my feelings; especially when, as is evident from your last letter, you stand more than usually in need of the consolation and encouragement of sympathy. But alas! when I give my thoughts, I give the best I have. You wonder at &#x2018;the boundless capacity Man has of loving&#x2019;&#x2014;boundless indeed it is in <hi rend="italic">some</hi> natures, immeasurable and inexhaustible: but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> also wonder, judging from myself, at the limitedness and even narrowness of that capacity in <hi rend="italic">others</hi>. &#x2026; There are many of Earth&#x2019;s noblest beings, with boundless capacity of love, whom the falseness and halfness which you speak of, have so hemmed round and so filled with distrust and fear that &#x2018;they <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> not love.&#x2019; But mine is a trustful nature, and I have an unshakeable faith in others though not in myself.&#x201D;</note> as I can well discern, who see some <hi rend="italic">ten years</hi> farther into it than you. However, this also was among <pb id="pg-06-349" n="06:349"/>your endowments, that you should be unconscious of them, and even prove their existence by sorrowing for the want of them. For the rest, go on boldly, whithersoever you have Light to go. To all men, whom God has made, there is one thing possible: to speak and to act God&#x2019;s Truth, and bid the Devil&#x2019;s Falsehood, and whatsoever <hi rend="italic">it</hi> can promise or threaten, an irrevocable farewell. For no man is there properly speaking any more possible. I rejoice very deeply to convince myself by clearer and clearer symptoms that you have chosen this &#x201C;better part&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">I Henry IV</hi>, V, iv.</note> and so I prophecy nothing but good of you. But we will talk all those matters, far more at large, in <date when="1833-08-00">August</date>; which will be here by and by.</p>
<p>One other thing gives me pleasure, that your interest in Politics abates rather than increases. Your view of that matter corresponds perfectly with my own: a huge chaotic Deluge of floating lumber mud and noisome rubbish, in which is fixation or firm footing nowhere. &#x201C;Cast <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> thy seed-corn on the Nile waters; thou shalt find it after many days.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 11:1.</note> What thou doest is is [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of most uncertain moment; that thou do it <hi rend="italic">truly</hi> is of quite infinite moment. So believe; so have all good men, from the beginning of the world, believed.</p>
<p>I am grown a little better, both in body and mind. These wretched east winds are still to be tolerated: but the business of assiduous scribbling comforts me; heartfelt <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> would make me forget everything, only <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is not always possible. I have written a long half-mad kind of story about the Archquack <hi rend="italic">Cagliostro</hi>, which you will see some time in some Magazine or other. I feel half-tempted to burn it; nevertheless let it stand: it is all moderately true, tho&#x2019; written about a grand Falsehood. One is rather sadly off with these Magazine-vehicles (Dog&#x2019;s-meat Carts, as I often call them): however, it is once for all our element in these days; let us work in it, while it is <hi rend="italic">called to-day</hi>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 9:4, and the end of &#x201C;The Everlasting Yea&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.</note> The sheets of <hi rend="italic">Diderot</hi> were all fairly corrected two weeks ago; you will see it in the next Number of Cochrane.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>.</note></p>
<p>Happy that you have found those Books, at least found some trace of finding them! It saves Napier from a heavy charge which Black the Bookseller here advised me to bring against him: namely, that they might be still lying in his own house! I will choose a surer re-conveyance next time. Certainly too you will at length find the Parcel in some crypt of the India House: it was a common brown-paper one, <pb id="pg-06-350" n="06:350"/>perhaps about a foot cubic; had your name written on it (too faintly it is like) yet probably as large as a Pen would write it. Fraser&#x2019;s Parcel will be here in two weeks: if W. Fraser&#x2019;s Book cannot be got readily, do not mind it.</p>
<p>I saw Buller&#x2019;s speech<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the House of Commons (<date when="1833-03-11">11 March</date>), on the second reading of the Irish Disturbances Bill, reported at some length in the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> (<date when="1833-03-16">16 March</date>), opposing the Bill &#x201C;as a violent measure, the tendency of which would be to irritate not pacify.&#x201D; He proposed an amendment, but the Bill passed by 363 votes to 84. See also the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1833-03-17">17 March</date>, p. 167.</note> the night it arrived here: but could form little conjecture about its value or reception: I apprehend, his infirm state of <hi rend="italic">lungs</hi> itself would prevent great success there. In any case, &#x201C;bursts of parliamentary eloquence&#x201D; are, in these days, among the absurdest of things. Pray tell me about Charles, if you ever see him; also about the elder people, whose probable losses I am sorry to hear of.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written that Buller had &#x201C;the finest understanding&#x201D; of his &#x201C;set&#x201D; (i.e., of &#x201C;Utilitarian Radicals&#x201D;) and that &#x201C;the Bullers &#x2026; have lost money by failures in India, not enough to impoverish them, but <hi rend="italic">any</hi> loss falls heavily on people who live up to their income.&#x201D;</note> It is a most kindly feeling that still connects me with that family.</p>
<p>Leigh Hunt says, I must &#x201C;rebuke you&#x201D; for not bringing that Note yourself: he has long had a desire to know you.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a postscript to his letter of <date when="1832-12-01">1 Dec. 1832</date>.</note> So whenever you feel called that way, the road is open. The return also will be open; that is to say, Hunt is a most <hi rend="italic">harmless</hi> man. I call him one of the ancient Mendicant Minstrels, strangely washed ashore into a century he should not have belonged to. For the rest, unless you feel <hi rend="italic">called</hi>, it is not worth while to go: he has nothing to teach you, nothing to show you&#x2014;except himself, should you think that worthy.</p>
<p>For poor Glen&#x2019;s sake I am sorry you have lost him. Nobody here has any connexion with Glen: in London, I can only bethink me that he used to visit at Basil Montague&#x2019;s 25. Bedford Square (you have seen Mrs Montague, and my name and your own were a sufficient pas<supplied>[s]</supplied>port there for inquiry); farther that he was a Member of the <hi rend="italic">Literary Union;</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the City of London Literary and Scientific Institution. Mill wrote on <date when="1833-05-18">18 May</date>, &#x201C;At the Literary Union I can learn no more of Glen.&#x201D;</note> and, what perhaps is the best chance of all, entered Student in Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn. The Letter is of no manner of consequence: keep it for year and day; and then, if it be unclaimed, burn it.</p>
<p>Hayward somebody tells me has out his poor Translation of <hi rend="italic">Faust:</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Abraham Hayward (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>) had brought out his translation of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> in <date when="1833-02-00">February</date>. He was a barrister, Q.C. in <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>, essayist and miscellaneous writer.</note> &#x201C;the cleverest of our second-rate men,&#x201D; I doubt, will but have made a bungle of that business. However, it is published at his own expense; of his own right-hand a man is master. &#x2014; What think you of <pb id="pg-06-351" n="06:351"/>this other piece of gossip, currently believed here: That I was living in the closest sworn-league, last winter, with Fonblanque; and even (it was probable) a guest in his house for some months! Poor &#x201C;suffering-remnant&#x201D; of Conservatives! They knew me to be no Whig, and fondly trusted I might stand by altar and throne: alas, &#x201C;the deepseated, silent, slow-burning, inextinguishable Radicalism fills us with a shuddering admiration.&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 250.</note>&#x2014; We have two blustering Turkey-cocks lecturing here at present on the Negroes: one an Anti-Slaver; the other a Slaver that follows him Ibis-like to destroy his Crocodile-eggs. They fill the emptier head with vague horror and jarring.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The two speakers were George Thompson (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>), abolitionist, and Peter Borthwick (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>). In <date when="1833-10-00">Oct. 1833</date> a further series of Thompson&#x2019;s lectures led to the formation of the Edinburgh Society for the abolition of slavery throughout the world; in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> he went to the United States, worked in the antislavery movement, was denounced by Gen. Jackson, and escaped from Boston to England, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>; revisited America in <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date> and during the Civil War, when he was given a reception by the House of Representatives; he was prominent in other political fields and M.P. for Tower Hamlets, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You are to be Lady of the least share today, unless you reckon in John&#x2019;s Letter too, which will make matters up. I hope the whole with the two Dud Magazines will reach you safe on Thursday.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He is writing on Tuesday.</note></p>
<p>I have finished my Paper on the &#x201C;Quack of Quacks&#x201D;; but got no new one fallen to; the house being in a kind of racket for the present. Mrs Welsh is here, and Miss Helen Welsh from Liverpool; and tho&#x2019;, if I determine on it, I can have my own fire, and room and bolt it against all people, it seems not worth while at present, for I am better resting. I had made myself <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi> enough with my writing, and had need to recover; as I am doing.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> on <date when="1833-03-21">21</date> and <date when="1833-03-25">25 March</date>: &#x201C;Finished <hi rend="italic">Cagliostro</hi> (a foolish extravagant piece); am now minded partly to write a <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi>. Very sick; very stupid.
<p>&#x201C;Letter from John: hopes he is coming home. Mrs Welsh and Cousin Helen. Yesterday <hi rend="italic">Teegur Wull</hi> (W. Dunlop) came rushing in on us; a man worth looking at; savage as Hengst or Horsa was; like them too, strangely enough, becoming in some sort a Captain of Emigration. The needfulest of all trades at present.</p>
<p>&#x201C;<foreign>Stupiditas Stupiditatum: omnia Stupiditas</foreign>!&#x201D;</p></note></p>
<p>Mrs Welsh is greatly failed since we left her, that is to say, in looks, for intrinsically I hope and believe she is better. Her face for the first time looks wrinkled, and decidedly old. She is weak, and lonely, but does not lose heart. The Doctor expects this little trip may do her good; as I think it may too. Helen is a brisk young damsel, of eighteen; strikingly reminds one of her little Aunt Jeannie; another and not the same!</p>
<p>As for my own dame, she agrees but indifferently with these wild March winds; as I fear my Mother too does. The advice I will always reiterate is: Take care of yourself, dear Mother! Such splashing and sleeting, with bright deceitful sunblinks, and the fierce nipping north-wind, need in all ways to be guarded against. Put on plenty of flannel, be careful as ever about diet; go out as seldom as you possibly can, when the weather is unfavourable. I daresay your farmers too find it a very bad seed time: a man from Haddington, the other day, told me there was not a handful sown in East Lothian yet, so wet was everything.</p>
<p>Alick tells me that Austin is to stay with you another year; which, <pb id="pg-06-353" n="06:353"/>I daresay, is much the best arrangement for all parties. We hope Mary and the Child are doing well. They may expect a better chance of settlement some time within the twelvemonth.</p>
<p>Jane is for East Lothian, one of these weeks; I think I shall hardly go. There is nothing there for me but the old story over again: what work I can do lies mostly here.</p>
<p>The Floor that fell last day I was writing killed one man; a Banker living not far from this.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Smith, &#x201C;one of our old and highly respected citizens&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1833-03-20">20 March</date>); see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330316-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1833-03-16">16 March</date></ref></note> He was just bidding at a Picture. One of his sons was with him, and escaped: the other is said to be almost in a state of distraction with grief.</p>
<p>I have not called on Dr M&#x2019;Crie; but will now that I am idler; perhaps tomorrow. Macvey Napier has been obliged (by dunning) to pay me my money; he has paid rather stintedly, but it will do. We are to dine with him on friday [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Napier&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1833-03-22">22 March</date> had contained an invitation to dinner. It apologizes for late payment but does not indicate the amount.</note> my <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> for him is probably over.</p>
<p>All things are very stagnant here; many people, I doubt, ill off; a great number are going to America.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emigration had much increased, and Carlyle might well have been struck by the numerous advertisements in the Scottish press offering passage to North America and Australia.</note> They are truly hard Times: well if there is a clear <hi rend="small-caps">Eternity</hi> behind them!</p>
<p>The very Clergy cannot get their stipends paid. They have fallen off <hi rend="italic">a third</hi> last year; the people let their furniture be seized, and put to sale, and then nobody will bid for it. Ominous signs! However, it is conjectured they mean to abolish the law of Patronage; then Church matters may go on a little better.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Still a lively issue in Scotland. Carlyle may have read in the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> of <date when="1833-03-06">6 March</date> the statement: &#x201C;The breeze of agitation for Church Reform is at length beginning to <foreign><hi rend="italic">sough</hi></foreign> through the aisles of our quiet Caledonian Kirk, and some of the cobwebs which age and inactivity have engendered, are likely soon to be swept from that venerable fabric. &#x2026; The first abuse for correction has been singled out in the shape of lay patronage.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>There is a Letter here for Jean;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This lost letter was certainly on the subject of Jean&#x2019;s intention to marry James Aitken, even though she avoided the subject in her letter of reply on <date when="1833-03-28">28 March</date>.</note> which, unless she voluntarily show it you, you are not to ask for a sight of.</p>
<p>Did Alick show you Irving&#x2019;s speech at the Annan Presbytery? I read it with a mixture of admiration and deep pain: the man is of such heroic temper, and of head so distracted. The whole matter <pb id="pg-06-354" n="06:354"/>looked to me like a horrid kind of Merry-Andrew Tragedy.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving appeared before the presbytery and a congregation of 2,000 in the church at Annan on <date when="1833-03-13">13 March</date> where he had been baptized and ordained. After a trial of seven hours, he was declared to be no longer a minister or member of the Church of Scotland. The trial was widely reported in the press, and the report from the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> (<date when="1833-03-19">19 March</date>) was reprinted as a pamphlet. Carlyle writes in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> that he remembered reading about it in &#x201C;some Newspaper, with lively conception and emotion. A poor aggregate of Reverend <hi rend="italic">Sticks</hi>,&#x201D; condemning a cause &#x201C;which might have been tried in Patmos, under the Presidency of St. John, without the right truth of it being got at!&#x201D; (II, 208; see also 189&#x2013;90).</note> Poor Dow,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. David Dow of Irongray, who interrupted the proceedings with a loud outcry.</note> I think, will end in a madhouse; Irving will end one cannot prophecy how; he must go from wild to wilder. This is the issue of what once appeared the highest blessing for him: Popularity!</p>
<p>But I will finish here; time is pressing, and there is so much wrapping and packing yet to do; and another Note to write to M&#x2019;Diarmid. I hope to bring a Paper of my own home with me, and give it you. Who knows but Jack and all may meet us there before harvest! I have not written to him yet; but will, probably this week.</p>
<p>What a day of sleet-deluges! Jane and her Mother and Cousin are all off to George&#x2019;s Square (Bradfute&#x2019;s), and have left me to eat in solitude: they are to be home, after tea; under roof of hackney Coach.</p>
<p>Do not forget to present in an especial manner my brotherly regards to little Jenny: I begin to have a very great regard for her, and esteem much her quiet prudent ways.</p>
<p>God always keep you all! <closer><salute>I remain ever, / My Dear Mother, / Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I am making up a Parcel to go this day, by the Dumfries Bookseller, to Scotsbrig; and will not neglect, as the very first thing I set about, to answer your kind and acceptable Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1833-03-14">14 March</date>.</note> which we have <pb id="pg-06-355" n="06:355"/>now had in hand since Saturday morning gone a week. You will not expect much sense of me; for I have many Letters to write, little time, and many interruptions. Mrs Welsh, and her Niece from Liverpool (a very pleasant young damsel) have been here for about a week; our servant Nancy has <foreign><hi rend="italic">plotted</hi></foreign> [scalded] the skin off her foot, and goes <foreign><hi rend="italic">hirpling</hi></foreign> [limping] along in most lame style: so that, for the time, it is but a confused kind of house. We removed into it, out of the old one at Stockbridge, as our Mother has perhaps informed you, to get rid of the abominablest <hi rend="italic">neighbourhood</hi>, which honest people could find themselves in. That great point happily has been attained, and so all the rest may be put up with.</p>
<p>It gave us great satisfaction to hear from you so good an account of everything at Scotsbrig and Catlinns; and to see that for the present at least your labour does not prove in vain. It is saying much, as things now go in this distracted country. Millions (a frightful word, but a true one!) millions of mortals are toiling this day, in our British Isles, without prospect of rest, save in speedy death, to whom for their utmost toiling food and shelter are too high a blessing. When one reads of the Lancashire Factories and little children labouring for sixteen hours a day, inhaling at every breath a quantity of cotton <hi rend="italic">fuz</hi>, falling asleep over their wheels, and roused again by the lash of thongs over their backs, or the slap of &#x201C;billy-rollers&#x201D; over their little crowns;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had probably read &#x201C;The Factory System&#x201D; [by John Wilson], <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, XXXIII (<date when="1833-04-00">April 1833</date>), 419&#x2013;50, which quotes extensively from the report of the Select Committee on Factory Children&#x2019;s Labour (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">32</date>). It explains the use of the &#x201C;black strap&#x201D; and the &#x201C;billy-roller,&#x201D; which is &#x201C;a heavy rod, from two to three yards long, and of two inches diameter, with an iron pivot at each end,&#x201D; meant to run &#x201C;on the top of the cording over the feeding cloth,&#x201D; but also used for striking the children to keep them awake. The <date when="1833-04-00">April</date> number of <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s</hi> was published by <date when="1833-03-25">March 25</date>.</note> and then again of Irish whitefeet,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the secret societies in Ireland which, from the <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2019;s onwards, tried to combat eviction by terrorism. They were one of the causes of the Irish Disturbances Bill&#x2014;consistently opposed by the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> with which Carlyle agreed.</note> driven out of their potatoe-patches and mudhovels, and obliged to take the hillside as broken men,&#x2014;one pauses with a kind of amazed horror, to ask if this be Earth the place of Hope, or Tophet where hope never comes! A good practical inference too every one of us may draw from it: to be thankful that with him it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yet so, to be content under many griefs, and patiently struggle on towards a better day, which even in this world cannot fail to dawn for the afflicted children of men. One grand remedy against the worst still lies partly open: America and its forests, where you have only the wild <hi rend="italic">beasts</hi> to strive against! I understand <pb id="pg-06-356" n="06:356"/>there never was such emigration from these parts, at least from Edinburgh, as this year. People of all sorts are going: Labourers, shopkeepers, even writers to the Signet, and Country Lairds. They are very right; <hi rend="italic">they</hi> will be all the better, and the country all the better for the want of them.&#x2014; But, in the meanwhile, do you, my dear Brother, go on tilling the Dryfesdale clod, while it will yield you anything: surely, it is probable, the Government, before matters come to the utmost pass, will apply itself in earnest to Emigration, as the sole remedy for all that most immediately presses on us. Let us &#x201C;possess our souls in patience, and await what can betide.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 21:19.</note></p>
<p>Nothing in your Letter has given me more thought than what you say about Jean.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330316-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1833-03-16">16 March</date></ref></note> I feel internally the utmost reluctance that she should, especially in this headlong manner, connect herself with James Aitken: he is a young man not without several qualifications, yet of whom I never could get any assurance; nay there is something in the very cast of his face that bids me doubt him. But on the other hand what a delicate matter to interfere in! Suppose you even threw aside anxieties about &#x201C;reflexions on yourself,&#x201D; and cheerfully undertook to bear such in any quantity that you might do your Sister good, yet how are you to set about it with no better light than mine? A young woman has need to be married some time; if by a solemn monition you put her off this engagement (and even an advice to <hi rend="italic">delay</hi> may turn out to break it), who knows whether, among such a scandalous set as men are become, she may next time make a better? I know not well what to do: yet will, this day, write her an <hi rend="italic">opinion</hi> of mine that she ought decidedly to <hi rend="italic">delay</hi>. I do not like the man, at least considered as her husband; yet cannot prove even to myself how I ought to dislike him. May God turn all to good; for we ourselves are blind!</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s Letter, which arrived on the same day with yours, is sent along with this; will inform you of his movements and prospects. It seems not improbable that we may see him this summer after all. What he will next do must then unfold itself: I really could hardly give him an advice. However, he seems grown very greatly wiser since his last return home; to the wise man wise conduct is <hi rend="italic">always</hi> possible.</p>
<p>Edinburgh continues one of the dullest and poorest and on the whole paltriest of places for me. I cannot remember that I have heard one sentence with true meaning in it uttered since I came hither! The very power of Thought seems to have forsaken this Athenian City; at least, a more entirely shallow, barren, unfruitful and trivial set of persons <pb id="pg-06-357" n="06:357"/>than those I meet with never that I remember came across my &#x201C;bodily vision.&#x201D; One has no right to be angry with them: poor fellows, far from it! Yet does it remain evident that &#x201C;Carlyle is wasting his considerable talent on impossibilities, and can never do any good.&#x201D; Time will show: for the present, poor man, he is quite fixed to <hi rend="italic">try</hi>. At any rate there are some good Books here, that one can borrow and read; kindly-disposed human creatures too, who tho&#x2019; they cannot without a shudder see one spit in the Devil&#x2019;s face so, yet wish one well, almost love one. The best is that I have been rather busy writing, and have finished a long sort of thing for Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine, to be called <hi rend="italic">Cagliostro:</hi> it is very wild, but not untrue, so may do its part. Write away, my man! that is thy only chance; these poor persons, demean them as they may, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">can do the&#x2019; neither ill no&#x2019; good</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280420-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:369</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1828-04-20">20 April 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> We have liberty to stay here till near whitsunday; but shall not likely continue far beyond the end of <date when="1833-04-00">April</date>: in <date when="1833-05-00">May</date> we can hope to see you at Catlinns. Except house-rent it seems hardly more expensive here than at Puttoch, so much have things fallen in price; or perhaps, mainly, so much has housewife-cunning risen! We have not so comfortable a roomy life as there; but all else is far superior.&#x2014; What we are to make of ourselves next winter, if we be spared so long, is not clear yet; but will become so. I wonder if we could not get ourselves established somewhere &#x201C;under the immediate eye of some little Grier,&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A phrase used by Alexander, <date when="1833-03-14">14 March</date>, presumably in reference to the father of Jean Grier, who married Samuel Aitken. Alick assumed that the couple would live among the Griers and be taken care of by them.</note> or other! A man of that kind to take care of one were a blessing indeed: Poor little Grier, &#x201C;after all&#x201D;! as the Doctor would say: one feels a kindly wish towards him, a thankful sentiment towards Providence, everytime one&#x2019;s eye is turned that way.&#x2014; There will be time for another Letter before we return: you know the address now.&#x2014; Jane does not seem to improve of late: however, she has far more entertainment here. She is out at this moment, or would send little Namesake and you her love. And so God bless you all!</p>

<salute>My dear Miss Hunter</salute>
<p>Here is a note for your friend,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> which I beg of you to deliver for me; as I do not know his address&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wish we had been at home yesterday when you called, for you always do me good. I do not know how I should like you as an adversary; but bringing, as you do, so much vehemence and clearsightedness to the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> side of most questions (that is to say to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> side) I feel strongly disposed, in true German style, to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">swear everlasting friendship</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;with you.</p>
<p>I hope Mr Jeffrey&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Jeffrey, who had married Susan Hunter&#x2019;s sister.</note> cold and your Sister&#x2019;s toothach<supplied>[e]</supplied> are better, and that they will come with you tomorrow evening. Do use your influence to persuade.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1833-02-27">27 Feb.</date></note> has been here now within a few hours of two weeks; and I bethink me this morning, for the first time <hi rend="italic">decisively</hi>, that it has been too long unanswered. I determine accordingly; tho&#x2019; the morning otherwise was not favourable. Should you have <hi rend="italic">left</hi> Florence before this reach you, it will be a very foolish business: but surely you will not leave in a week; therefore I hope better. Our house has been very confused, for the last two weeks, Mrs Welsh and her Niece from Liverpool being here since then; I myself too am <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi>, as after a spell of writing, bad lodging and bad weather: these are my excuses for delay. Let me hasten however to inform you that nothing has gone wrong with us, worth calling wrong: I had a Letter from Scotsbrig this morning, and there too all is well.</p>
<p>We are very proud of the prospect of seeing you this summer. May it realise itself; may it prove happy for us all! You will find much changed in Dumfriesshire; but not the affection of those that remain for you. There will be much to tell, much to speculate upon, and devise for the time that is to come. After all manner of deliberate communing some resolution will arise, something that one can <hi rend="italic">put</hi> his hand to and begin pushing onwards. I have thought much about your future, of late; see it, like all our futures, full of obstruction; nevertheless will not cease to hope good. It is a most ruinous chaotic Time this of ours; a Time of confusion outward and inward, of falsehood; imbecillity [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], destitution, desperation, unbelief: woe to him who has within himself no light of Faith to guide his steps thro&#x2019; it! My main comfort about you is to see the grand practical lesson of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Entsagen</hi></foreign> [Renunciation] impressing itself, in ineffaceable <hi rend="italic">devoutness</hi>, on your heart: herein it is well said, <foreign><hi rend="italic">eigentlich beginnt das Leben</hi></foreign> [life actually begins];<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle says this in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>, and Goethe had said it in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi> (see Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 191).</note> whoso is a Man may in all seasons scenes and circumstances live like a Man. Let us take the world bravely then, and fight bravely to the end, since nothing else has been appointed us. I have inquired with myself often whether you should settle here, at London, or <pb id="pg-06-360" n="06:360"/>where: but cannot get so much as a dubious light to found an advice on. This is but a pitiful place; but indeed all places are pitiful. In the grand universal race towards Ruin (economical) we are as I judge almost a whole generation behind London; this I infer from various symptoms, mainly from the blessed feebleness of our system of Puffery. Nevertheless here too things are advancing with most rapid pace, a few years will bring us a long way. Universal Poverty is already here; numerous persons, and these are the wisest, determine this season to fly over seas, to America, Australia, anywhither where the Famine is not. Ruin economical is not far distant: and then in regard to Ruin spiritual I should say that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was already triumphant among us; while in chaotic London there were blissful symptoms here and there discernible of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Palingenesia</hi></foreign>. This makes the difference. In London amid its huge deafening hubbub of a Deathsong are to be heard tones of a Birthsong; while here all is putrid, scandalous, decadent hypocritical, and sounds thro&#x2019; your soul like a lugubrious universal <foreign><hi rend="italic">Naenia</hi></foreign> [funeral song], chaunted by foul midnight hags! There is misanthropy and philanthropy for you; expressed with poetic emphasis enough! The truth is, as thou seest, dear Jack, this Edinburgh yields me for the present small solace, small furtherance: nevertheless, except in thought, perpetually protesting against most that I see and hear, I do nowise quarrel with it; leave it to go its road, I meanwhile going mine. In sober truth, however, it might almost surprise one to consider how infinitely small a quantity, not of enlightened Speech one catches here, but even of Speech at all, for that jargon that is uttered without conviction, from the teeth outward, who would name that Speech, more than the inarticulate cawing of rooks and magpies? Peace be with it! There are Books to be got at; air to breathe; and lastly a Coach to carry you back moorwards, when that becomes more tolerable.</p>
<p>Most likely I mentioned last time that I was writing a Paper on <hi rend="italic">Cagliostro</hi>. I might perhaps with advantage have asked you some questions about his last scene of Life, your Roman St Angelo and St Leo;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Two prisons in Rome where Cagliostro was incarcerated during his last years. See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 316&#x2013;17.</note> but I did not recollect that possibility: and now the thing is all finished off, perhaps more carefully than it deserved to be. It is for <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>, and may perhaps suit him well enough; otherwise I value the Article below a pin&#x2019;s price: it will do no ill, and that is the most one can say of it. I am partly minded next to set forth some small <pb id="pg-06-361" n="06:361"/>Narrative about the <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, XV (<date when="1837-01-00">Jan.</date>, <date when="1837-02-00">Feb., 1837</date>), 1&#x2013;19, 172&#x2013;89; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 324&#x2013;402.</note> (once so celebrated a business); but must wait a day or two till I have <foreign><hi rend="italic">freies Feld</hi></foreign> [free run]. Our Ladies go to Haddington next week; I may then begin if I like: it will serve me till about the time of our departure homewards, which we date a month hence. We shifted into this new King-Street house some three weeks ago: the old Carlton Street one had grown quite disagreeable with noises, no less than a &#x201C;woman of bad character&#x201D; being established above us! This had been our Landlady&#x2019;s reason for letting her house; but on finding it out we made her retract again, and were off. This house which we have at the same rent is exactly the North-east Corner of the Street (first floor) quite close to where John Gordon used to live. He is now on the quite opposite end of this same King Street; as loving as ever, but alas as strange a mixture as ever of Scotch shrewdness and oblivious stupidity, honest-heartedness overlaid with Blackwood rubbish; a very monotonous, uninstructive man. I suspect he means to <hi rend="italic">wed</hi> about Whitsunday, for his new College Secretaryship will enable him: very sincerely do I wish and expect for him all reasonable felicity.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320528-TC-MN-01">TC to MN, <date when="1832-05-28">28 May 1832</date></ref>.</note> A man Aird<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Aird (<sic><date when="1802-00-00">1802</date></sic><corr><date when="1804-00-00">1804</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">76</date>), journalist, poet, and miscellaneous writer. His <hi rend="italic">Religious Characteristics</hi> were published at Edinburgh in <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>; he became editor of the Edinburgh <hi rend="italic">Weekly Journal</hi>, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>, and of the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>.

also comes about us; author of a mad imitation of Chalmers, called &#x201C;Christian Characteristics,&#x201D; or some such thing. A person of decided innocence, openness almost genius, without the smallest culture, except from Blackwood&#x2019;s backshop. You can fancy him; his narrow prominent hirsute brow, kind grey eyes; huge stupid chin: the strong Roxburgh accent agreeably reminds me of old Church. Wilson I have met only once: I had called on him before; as he never returned it, I could not go near him again; more especially after all the blethering stuff he had uttered on that matter for years past. I still read his Magazine-palaver with an affectionate interest; believe that there is nothing to be got from him. We will not quarrel, but also need not agree: this night Gordon invites me to meet him at supper; but I cannot resolve to go; the man is not worth an indigestion.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1833-03-31">31 March</date> Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;Last night I declined to go and meet Wilson at Gordon&#x2019;s supper; an affair of judgement, of calculation. The Professor weighed against an indigestion seemed the lighter of the two. Gordon tells me that the Professor appears to be changing of late years or months, the predominant quality in him becoming <hi rend="italic">Gigmanism</hi>. Not unlikely. G&#x2019;s account is curious enough; one of those inspirations which wondrously from time to time irradiate the general stagnancy of honest John. Who can understand a man? Even Gordon in several respects has been very obscure to me. I now see him better again; and cultivate him: he too is a mild letter of reproof to me; which I must disregard.&#x201D;</note> Dequincey, who has been once <pb id="pg-06-362" n="06:362"/>seen out this winter, sent me word he would come and see me; he will do no such thing, poor little fellow: he has hardly got out his <foreign><hi rend="italic">cessio bonorum</hi></foreign> [means of satisfying his creditors], and for the present (little Moir, his friend, pathetically says) &#x201C;is living on game which has spoiled on the poulterer&#x2019;s hand&#x201D;; having made a bargain to that effect with him, and even run up a score of &#xa3;15! Let D&#x2019;Israeli<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isaac D&#x2019;Israeli, as author of <hi rend="italic">Calamities of Authors</hi> (London, <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>).</note> remember that. Sir W. Hamilton I like best of any; but see little of him. I even met the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">hash</hi> Blackwood&#x201D;; who has mounted a Carriage now, and rides prosperously: &#x201C;I saw the wicked great in power.&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 37:35. For William Blackwood, see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250108-TC-AC-01"><sic>3:242</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1825-01-08">8 Jan. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> It was at Moir&#x2019;s this rencounter, at dinner; the &#x201C;hash&#x201D; somewhat reconciled me by his presence; I traced in him several features of my friend Cagliostro; and said honestly: Live, then, enjoy thy life, as subaltern Quack; the Devil is busy with us all. Naso<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macvey Napier.</note> I visited in the dining way, yesternight, for the first and probably last time. He affected to be extremely kind, and our party (with an American Anti-slave Enthusiast in it) went off quite happily: but Naso wants that first fundamental requisite of genius, I fear: common honesty. He has paid me, and shabbily, and on compulsion that last debt of his; and now, as I reckon, our editorial relation may have terminated. That pecuniary defalcation of his has again sorrowfully altered my scriptory method of procedure: but we cannot help it, must even turn ourselves elsewhither. Old Dr M&#x2019;Crie<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Thomas M&#x2019;Crie.</note> too I have made acquaintance with; an honest ancient divine, of the Dutch sort; very learned in Scotch ecclesiastical history, a thing I take some interest in of late. Dr Irving<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. David Irving.</note> is as leaden-gloomy as ever; Repp got me down <hi rend="italic">Agrippa de vanitate</hi><note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For T.

The book was Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (<date when="1486-00-00">1486</date>&#x2013;<date when="1535-00-00">1535</date>), <hi rend="italic">De Incertitudine et Vanitate Scientiarum Declamatio invectivo</hi> (Antwerp, <date when="1530-00-00">1530</date>), translated as <hi rend="italic">Of the Vanity and Uncertainty of Artes and Sciences</hi> (London, <date when="1569-00-00">1569</date>).</note> yesterday with great briskness, and gaiety of heart: he has made a party for himself among the younger sort of Advocates. But I must finish this.
Did you hear of Ballantyne the Printer&#x2019;s<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Ballantyne (<date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>), printer; he had been schoolfellow of Sir Walter Scott, then with his brother John publishing associate with him; after the bankruptcy of <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date> he was employed by the creditors&#x2019; trustees as editor of the Edinburgh <hi rend="italic">Weekly Journal</hi> until his death on <date when="1833-01-17">17 Jan.</date></note> death? Last Sunday <pb id="pg-06-363" n="06:363"/>poor M&#x2019;Corkindale whom you remember well, took ill of inflammation, in the afternoon, and was dead on monday [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] morning!<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel M&#x2019;Corkindale (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>), printer&#x2019;s foreman: see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260125-JBW-MAC-01"><sic>4:27</sic><corr>JBW to MAC, <date when="1826-01-25">25 Jan. 1826</date></corr></ref>. His obituary in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Weekly Journal</hi> (<date when="1833-04-03">3 April</date>) recalls that he had been employed by Ballantyne&#x2019;s for nearly thirty years: &#x201C;he was a faithful and inestimable servant&#x201D; who &#x201C;enjoyed in a very high degree the respect and esteem of all the booksellers and others,&#x201D; as well as being equally &#x201C;respected and beloved&#x201D; by &#x201C;those under him.&#x201D;</note> So goes the world.</p>
<p>Oh Jack, what pains do I take with this thin paper and soft pen to write <hi rend="italic">small;</hi> hampering myself in a hundred ways, so that like M&#x2019;Nab of old, &#x201C;I can hardly <hi rend="italic">spell</hi> with such a pen&#x201D;! You must take it as it comes: I will now give you a little London news. The Reformed Parliament disappoints every one but me and the Tories. Endless jargon, no business done. I do not once a month look on the side of the world it sits on: let it go to the Devil in its <hi rend="italic">own</hi> way. Jeffrey has never tried speaking in it: he keeps his health better, this winter; about a fortnight ago he sent you his regards. Buller made a speech but I think with little effect: the elder Bullers have had losses in India. I wrote to Glen, under cover to Mill, who however cannot yet find him out. You must know Mill as you pass thro&#x2019; London, a man worth your knowing. By much industry we procured a Letter from Holcroft:<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330112-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-01-12">12 Jan.</date></ref></note> he reports very badly of several things. Badams gets more and more addicted to that fatal habit; the worst may be feared for him. A small indistinct Letter from himself gives no better omen: it bears to have been written in the interval of sickness and &#x201C;many family troubles.&#x201D; Poor Badams! My own private hypothesis is that if he and his Wife were once well <hi rend="italic">parted</hi>, it were better for both. Yet how make such a proposal! He evidently likes Bessy Barnet<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></ref>.</note> better than all other creatures; to her he again is the first of men and benefactors: she alone of all that household has a character equal to the emergency. Under her and her Mother&#x2019;s care there were a chance for him; hardly otherwise that I can see. Neither in my opinion does his Wife care much for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, tho&#x2019; she weeps much I daresay for her own husband; and her artificial inconstant vehement nature makes bad worse for all of them. Why did they ever wed? Badams bids me address &#x201C;At the Atheneum&#x201D; for him: if you wrote it could do no harm; the sight of you and advice from you might do much good, and I hope will. Of the Montagues nothing worth repeating. Of poor Edward Irving your Galignani<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></ref>.</note> will perhaps have told you enough. He came to Annan to <pb id="pg-06-364" n="06:364"/>be deposed; made a heroico-distracted Speech there, Dow finishing off with a Holy-Ghost shriek or two; wher<supplied>[e]</supplied>upon Irving calling on them to &#x201C;hear that&#x201D; indignantly withdrew. He says in a Letter printed in the Newspapers that he &#x201C;did purpose to tarry in those parts certain days, and publish in the towns of the coast the great name of the Lord&#x201D;;<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Mrs. M.

<p>It will be proper now to give you some sort of guidance about future writing of Letters. The whole secret lies in this: we are to be here till the <date when="1833-05-01">first of May</date>; after that we shall be moving towards Craigenputtoch, and our address will be <hi rend="italic">Dumfries</hi>. I shall attend to your instructions, and not write again save in <hi rend="italic">answer</hi> to your Letter; which we may still receive here if you write again directly; otherwise there must needs be some delay.&#x2014; I wish one could bethink him of many things you might still get and do before leaving Italy: but I have no remembrance at present. Cheap lithograph portraits, if they are attainable, please me much: I recollect no Book: <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> is one I can borrow; and indeed all Italy is much <hi rend="italic">sealed</hi> to me as yet; I know not even how to <hi rend="italic">inquire</hi>. Be sure your <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sch&#xF6;ne Seele&#x2019;s</hi></foreign> religious conversation with Goethe is not forgotten.<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written in his letter begun <date when="1833-02-27">27 Feb.</date> that a German baroness whom he had recently attended during a serious illness, almost &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">eine sch&#xF6;ne Seele</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [a beautiful soul], had not only known Berlin society well but had also known Goethe and Tieck. &#x201C;She dined with Goethe a few months before his death along with another lady, &#x26; the subject of their conversation was religion in which he got so much interested that he kept his two guests much later than usual preventing the servants from bringing candles &#x26; breaking into their solemn <foreign><hi rend="italic">Stimmung</hi></foreign> [mood]. I will ask about it more fully next time I see the baroness &#x26; take note of it.&#x201D;</note> Resume your Journal, and <pb id="pg-06-365" n="06:365"/>keep fast by it: you know not what may one day come of it. I must meet you at Paris with a Letter any way.</p>
<p>As to the Annandale people I have already told you in a sentence the cream of what was to be told. Alick had written to me just the day your Letter came: he was well and in good heart, had paid his rent and was struggling manfully along. At Scotsbrig nothing but sowing and gardening; our Mother had not been so well for a few days but was decidedly come round again. Alick said she was wonderfully resigned and even contented. To see you again will be one of the brightest points of her future: I suppose no day passes but she tries in her simple Love to picture out what you are doing in that so strange world. Perhaps I did not mention that Mary had another daughter; that her husband and she were not likely to get any farm this year, but are likely to continue at Scotsbrig over summer<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>

Landor was at this time living in his villa at Fiesole, where his visitors included Ralph Waldo Emerson, who dined with him on <date when="1833-05-15">15 May</date>. Emerson wrote: &#x201C;Sir James Mackintosh he would not praise, nor my Carlyle.&#x201D; Instead he insisted on talking about Southey, much to Emerson&#x2019;s annoyance. Later Carlyle told Emerson: &#x201C;Landor&#x2019;s principle is mere rebellion, and <supplied>[I fear]</supplied> that is the American principle also.&#x201D; See R. H.

He is about passing Surgeon&#x2019;s Hall; for graduating he is already too young by two years. Something useful in a moderate way may come of him if he lives. Both he and his Father are always very minute in their inquiries after you. Mitchell still continues sickly, yet able to discharge his duty, and puts on a contented face. Murray is in high health, and high prosperity in the boarding way: a most limited man; I have seen him only twice. The Paper is full here, and I must fly to the margins. Turn over <foreign><hi rend="italic">getrosten muthes</hi></foreign> [cheerfully] to the beginning. Jane has walked very strictly by old Dr Hamilton&#x2019;s law; without any apparent advantage. Her complaint seems like mine, a kind of seated dyspepsia; no medicine is of avail, only regimen (when once one can find it out), free air, and if that were possible cheerfulness of mind.

and still hope for the better. She sends you her affection, and hopes we shall all meet at Craigenputtoch once more. Be it so, if it please God! All things, as your Faith tells you, <hi rend="italic">will</hi> turn out for good; if we ourselves prove good. Meanwhile the only clear duty of Man lies in <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, and nothing else: <hi rend="italic">Work;</hi> work wisely while it is called today. Nothing in this universe now frightens me, tho&#x2019; yearly it grows more stupendous, more divine; and the terrestrial <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> appointed us more poor and brief.

No great error there perhaps: but if it is added by my friends themselves that therefore I am spiritually lost? One&#x2019;s ears are bewildered by the inane chatter of the people; one&#x2019;s heart is for hours and days overcast by the sad feeling, There is none then, not one, that will believe in me!

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; but in poor writing-order today, I may as well send you a word; another day, if my unhappy head ache less, my time may be scantier. Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1833-04-11">11</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-04-12">12 April</date>.</note> tho&#x2019; rather speedier and not slower than usual, <pb id="pg-06-369" n="06:369"/>had been long looked for: there is still nothing here resembling you that I can fall in with; often it seems to me as if all men had eng<supplied>[ag]</supplied>ed to one another that sincere speech should cease and determine, and henceforth nothing but a hollow jargon without significance, arising in no belief and producing none, should form the utterance of man to man. It is a miserable mockery; a thing one&#x2019;s heart gets sick of even to nausea. But what is the remedy? This only: Do <hi rend="italic">thou thyself</hi> then speak ever the more truly; ever with the greater abhorrence avoid that same hollow jargoning, as a thing at once ridiculous and (looking at its consequences) lamentable and detestable.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written: &#x201C;Though I am sick of politics myself, I do not despair of improvement that way; <hi rend="italic">you</hi> hear the cackle of the noisy geese who surround the building, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> see a little of what is going on inside. I can perfectly sympathize in Bonaparte&#x2019;s contempt of the government of <foreign><hi rend="italic">bavards</hi></foreign> [talkative fools]: talking is one thing and <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> another: but while every corner of the land has sent forth its noisy blockhead to talk, over head I am near enough to see the real men of <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, and of head for work, who are quietly getting the working part of the machine into their hands, and will be masters of it as far as anybody can be with that meddling and ignorant assembly lawfully empowered to be <hi rend="italic">their</hi> masters.&#x201D;</note> I have a hundred matters to talk over with you; more than whole paper-quires would hold, had I whole weeks to write them in. Let me still calculate with certainty that we shall meet face to face in <date when="1833-08-00">August</date>; in the middle of the wild moors there will be scope enough, and neither tongue need be tied. Glory to God! there are still here and there on the Earth some articulate-speaking mortals; the highest, mysterious Gift, that of Language (for &#x201C;Man is properly an <hi rend="italic">incarnated Word</hi>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;the true <foreign>SHEKINAH</foreign> [embodiment of the Divine Presence] is Man,&#x201D; attributed by him to Saint Chrysostom, and cf. also <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi>, V, i (Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 66).</note>) has not yet utterly dissipated itself into inane chattering and cawing; there is still Communion for man with man. So let us wait; and do not you disappoint me.</p>
<p>Those long fits of depression<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of which Mill had written.</note> are a thing too well known to myself: indeed, with me they have stretched themselves into long continuous years, and, but for what we call happy accidents, what we might more piously call kind Orderings of Providence, would have ere now brought me down to final Desperation. They originate very variously; the Physical and the Spiritual playing into one another&#x2019;s hand in the most mysterious way. But in any case they have, as you say, their blessed fruits. For what, if we consider it, is any Suffering be it of what sort soever? A <hi rend="italic">Dis</hi>order, as is well said; an extraneous thing which <hi rend="italic">We</hi> (our free will and force) are summoned to triumph <pb id="pg-06-370" n="06:370"/>over, and make into an <hi rend="italic">Order</hi>. Thus in all spiritual maladies, the sole cure is: Bestir thyself manlike; valiantly give battle to the enemy and defy him; in <hi rend="italic">so</hi> doing thou hast already conquered. &#x201C;Evil is but a Nightmare&#x201D; says Jean Paul, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">move</hi> yourself against it, it is already gone.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See &#x201C;Jean Paul Friedrich Richter Again,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 118.</note> But, indeed, so old is the phenomenon with me, I have now grown to look upon Pain as almost the <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> precursor to new Light; as if Thought were a thing that really needed to be travailled with before it could be born; and the Minerva sprang from the head only amid fire and after the frightfullest megrims. Often therefore like you, in lucid moments, I say to myself: Be still, rejoice even; thou will be all the wiser for this! Poor Leigh Hunt, I remember, once said, he knew a man of true thought to have been a man of sorrows, by this alone that his thought was true. The Frenchman remarked of Goethe&#x2019;s Picture: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Voil&#xE0; un homme qui a eu beaucoup de chagrins</hi></foreign> [There is a man who has had many troubles] (Goethe says, it should have been &#x201C;that has struggled toughly&#x201D;): a still higher instance, the highest of all, on this head, will at once suggest itself.&#x2014; As for poor me, if my increase of wisdom is to be in fair ratio to my late disquietude, I shall have made a rich venture of it this winter: it is among the saddest (from ill health outward and inward) I have known for long.</p>
<p>But now to quit speculation. The Book-parcel, which you as my merciful provider have got together for me, still lies at Fraser&#x2019;s: he wrote to me a week ago to that effect: I directed him to send it hither with his first-of-May Packet, at which time it will still find me, and be in good season. Doubt not, your Thoughts on Poetry and Art will deserve my fullest attention: what I make of it you shall honestly hear. Alas, in these days, all light Sportfulness, and melodious Art, has fled away from us, far away; not in Poetry, but only if so might be in Prophecy, in stern Old-Hebrew Denunciation, can one speak of the accursed Realities that now, and for generations, lie round us, and weigh heavy on us! But we will not enter on this. Speaking of Fraser, let me not forget a second time to answer you that the writer of that <hi rend="italic">Byron</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Critical Illustrations of Lord Byron&#x2019;s Poetry,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, VII (<date when="1833-03-00">March 1833</date>), 303&#x2013;17, by J. A. Heraud. For Heraud, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310824-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-24">24 Aug. 1831</date></ref>.</note> (according to my guess) is no disciple of mine, but of Coleridge&#x2019;s: one Heraud, who lives at Tottenham, and looks better on Paper than otherwise; a meritorious creature nevertheless, who from the depths of some Law-Stationer&#x2019;s shop could contrive to appropriate an Idea or two (even in Coleridge&#x2019;s sense), and now reechoes them, <pb id="pg-06-371" n="06:371"/>in long continuance,&#x2014;I fear, as from <hi rend="italic">un</hi>furnished chambers. Poor Heraud, if you could by any means <hi rend="italic">economically</hi> forward him (which is not likely, for he seems to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> bibliopolic vent, and is a kind of Torykin) were worth your acquaintance; but hardly otherwise. As for De Quincey<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had asked whether De Quincey was still in Edinburgh and what Carlyle&#x2019;s opinion of him was.</note> I have not seen him this winter; and no man, except Bailiffs, it appears, has for the last eighteen months: he is said to be in the uttermost, unaidable embarrassment; bankrupt in purse, and as nearly as possible in mind. I used to like him well, as one of the prettiest Talkers I ever heard; of great, indeed of diseased <hi rend="italic">acuteness</hi>, not without depth, of a fine sense too, but of no breadth, no justness; weak, diffuse, supersensitive; on the whole, a perverted, ineffectual man. Some Papers of his on the Roman Caesars in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Caesars,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, XXXII (<date when="1832-10-00">Oct. 1832</date>), 551&#x2013;612; (<date when="1832-12-00">Dec. 1832</date>), 949&#x2013;55; XXXIII (<date when="1833-01-00">Jan. 1833</date>), 43&#x2013;60.</note> are the last I know of him: Teufelsdreck might well pause in amazement to find Nero and Commodus there treated as having &#x201C;something sacred&#x201D; still,&#x2014;in virtue of their purple clothes. Dequincey [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] is one of the most irreclaimable Tories now extant; despising Poverty with a complete contempt; and himself, alas, poorer than ever Job was, who at worst never got <hi rend="italic">gazetted</hi>. The Conservatives here, I think, are wholly in a very fretful, tremulous condition: Wilson himself, tho&#x2019; he loves me, would evidently rather not meet me; I have seen him only once, and perhaps we shall hardly meet again. There is no man in the Island who has so wasted himself: a mass of Power standing on <hi rend="italic">no</hi> basis; drifted about by every breath; lamed into the despicablest Weakness. Pity enough! Yet Nature is <hi rend="italic">infinitely</hi> rich: the two <hi rend="italic">eggs</hi> one eats at breakfast could have filled the whole world with winged creatures; and they are swallowed at one meal, and no damage done. So too with <hi rend="italic">geniuses;</hi> a Thousand can be spent ephem<supplied>[erally;]</supplied> if one get to maturity we shall be content.</p>
<p>I read Roebuck&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Education</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Tait:</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;National Education,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, II (<date when="1833-03-00">March 1833</date>), 755&#x2013;65, in which Roebuck said that one of the first duties of a reformed Parliament should be to see how &#x201C;a comprehensive national, or universal education, may be established.&#x201D;</note> Roebuck has a conviction, a true one, but alm<supplied>[ost]</supplied> hopelessly mechanical and narrow; a lean, perseverant, unappeaseable nature; reminds me somewhat of Robespierre: he wins respect from me but not love, almost the reverse. Buller, as you often say, is the only Radical of the smallest genius; I rejoice much to hear that he promises to give himself fair play: one <pb id="pg-06-372" n="06:372"/>day we shall hear more of him.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1833-03-09">9 March</date> to Carlyle Mill had written: &#x201C;He <supplied>[Roebuck]</supplied> is narrow, still, but the other parliamentary radicals are narrower; all but our friend Charles <supplied>[Buller]</supplied>.&#x201D;</note> Out of Parliament there is another, and but one that I know of: friend Fonblanque. Speed to him! Yet after all the contest, as I view it, is but a mean and meagre one. Democracy (like enough, without either Lords or King) at no great distance from us, as from all Europe; and <hi rend="italic">then?</hi> It is very doubtful to me whether the best possible Reformed Parliament, made of the best possible men, could <hi rend="italic">govern</hi> in our old world: nay is not Democracy and Reformed Parliament essentially the solemn declaration that there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> Government, that every man governs himself? In America they do beautifully without governing of any kind; for this peculiar reason, that all men can <hi rend="italic">guide</hi> (or govern) themselves towards the Western Prairies. But, alas, for us who have <hi rend="italic">no</hi> Prairies, where if we find not new Captains (the old sham-captains being justly bundled out) the mass of men must perish miserably, trodden under foot of each other! Unhappy age, to which this sad task of Revolution was appointed, and could not longer be delayed. As for myself I look forward to it with the sorrowfullest interest; round on it with dispiritment, with a powerless pity which really amounts to pain. &#x201C;Bursts of parliamentary eloquence&#x201D; and millions of living souls sinking hourly in all senses to the Devil. A committee of inquiry which must doom some hundreds more to a death by &#x201C;cotton-fuz&#x201D;; as certain and far crueller than if the Committee had shot them at once.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1833-04-03">April 3</date> it had been agreed to appoint a Royal Commission to report on the factories, thus postponing the Ten Hours bill.</note> Devil&#x2019;s drink (because it is of distilled <hi rend="italic">barley</hi>) left untaxed, and bread and pottage taxed; in both cases, that the rent may rise.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., barley for whisky was untaxed, whereas (imported) wheat was taxed until the repeal of the Corn Laws in <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>.

Out upon it! One cannot look at it without a mixture of horror and contempt. I declare my prayer were that I could hide altogether from hearing of it; but that may not be.&#x2014;&#x2014; In these circumstances a gleam of hope rises on me from what you may reckon a strange quarter: James Stuart&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Travels in America</hi>. I read the Book two days ago; a most stupid Book, as far as talent goes; but to me most cheerful. It reminds one again that there is still a corner in God&#x2019;s Earth where the men that will work can live; all men in that happy western climate are secure from Cold and Hunger, and <pb id="pg-06-373" n="06:373"/>defy the fear of them. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gloria in excelsis!</hi></foreign> The very shoeblack sits dining &#x201C;on one of the fattest roasted geese we ever saw.&#x201D;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Stuart (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), <hi rend="italic">Three Years in North America</hi>, 2 vols.

What too is America but a <hi rend="italic">piece of England?</hi> These are our Brothers (and do no discredit to the house) let his Majesty in Council say to it what he likes. I venture also on a prediction: America may prove the safety-valve of England, of our old overcrowded Europe: farther unless some extensive far-reaching system of Emigration be organised, the result in few years must be a rebellion fearful to contemplate; the fierce implacable rebellion of Hunger and Ignorance against Wealth and Idleness, whose very imbecillity has become tyrannous, deadening and killing. This idea has long had deep hold of me; Stuart has blown upon it, and set it astir; perhaps it may not stop here.&#x2014; Here however my scribbling must stop, tho&#x2019; I had still whole volumes to tell. Write again soon, and give me another opportunity. <closer><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Vale et me ama</hi></foreign> [Farewell and love me].</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>From amid what is well named the &#x201C;agonies of Packing,&#x201D; I write you a hasty line, for memento and farewell. It is not farewell either, for in fact we are coming seventy miles nearer you: but somehow at every change of abode one so feels it.</p>
<p>We leave Edinburgh on Tuesday morning,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1833-05-07">7 May</date>.</note> and in two days more shall be at Craigenputtoch, in the old Hermitage Establishment, as it was, and as we were. I carry down some Books with me; contradictions enough to meditate on, and make into <hi rend="italic">coalitions;</hi> little else that is worth carrying. The winter has been sickly, dispiriting, stagnant; pleasant neither for the outward nor the inward man. Such a dreary morass of Dulness, Halfness, Unbelief; embarrassment, poverty spiritual and economical, it seems to me I never dwelt in: the truth is, Ruin, here as elsewhere is advancing with quite notable rapidity, and still darker days are in store for us. The overloaded Ass will lie down, and roll itself on its rider and squelch him; for any higher enterprise it has neither light nor heart: that is my prediction. I declare the aspect of the whole matter quite pains and saddens me; your whole mind is filled with pity, indignation, shame and sorrowful forebodings; and gladly escapes (if it can) into other contemplations.</p>
<p>So leaving things in general to fare as they may, let us have a word on things in particular. That &#x201C;Thornton comes to Scotland&#x201D; is a settled point with us; we wish now that you would, while time favours, <pb id="pg-06-375" n="06:375"/>get him what the sailors call &#x201C;under way.&#x201D; Our moors will have on their best cloak before May is done: there are long dawns and <foreign><hi rend="italic">gloamings</hi></foreign> (dusks); and sunsets (perhaps sunrises) that he and I must look at from mountain-tops together. Tell him to set his Packages in order, and take the road; there are friends waiting him at the end of it. We promise to send him back a healthier and a wiser man.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the next to the last line of &#x201C;The Ancient Mariner&#x201D;: &#x201C;A sadder and a wiser man.&#x201D;</note> When I once know his time, I will write to himself a Note of directions; if he come by Edinburgh, we shall try to have some friend waiting for him here to do the honours: you yourself little as you may be aware of it, have kind even ardent friends in this cold city. Let us be warned therefore in due time; it will all be easily arranged.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">True Sun</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">True Sun</hi> was a newspaper published from <date when="1832-03-05">5 March 1832</date> to <date when="1837-12-23">23 Dec. 1837</date>. In <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> Hunt reviewed new books for it. On <date when="1833-03-12">12 March</date> he had written to Carlyle: &#x201C;Do you see a newspaper? Would you like to see an evening one, the True Sun, the most radical of radicals? I have long ceased to write in it, not having been able to go on struggling with it, in addition to my own struggles; but it is making its way; it is still sent us; &#x26; I could frequently transmit it to Craigenputtoch&#x201D; (Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH</hi>, XLV, 451).</note> which amuses us not a little, will not after Saturday night (your London Saturday) find us here; but be doubly welcome in the wilderness, &#x201C;Craigenputtoch Dumfries.&#x201D; The unfortunate Book-parcel will also certainly get thither one day or other: I used to buy single <hi rend="italic">Tatlers</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Tatler</hi> was a daily journal of literature and the stage, published in London from <date when="1830-09-00">Sept. 1830</date> to <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> and edited by Leigh Hunt.</note> in London; I shall find use enough for it among the moors, either in rainy days or dry, where all are alike lonely, unvisited of any excitement, except the beginning of work and the ending of it.</p>
<p>Jeffrey has not written to me for many months: indeed till two weeks ago I was in his debt in that point. Whatever you may have written to him, I do not think he will in the long run misunderstand it, still less take it ill. He affects indeed the philosophy of a man of the world, and has no settled <hi rend="italic">creed</hi> of any higher sort: but there is a perpetual noble contradiction to it in that poetical heart of his. He loves all men, and especially loves the love of all men.</p>
<p>My good Dame sends her affectionate re<supplied>[gards]</supplied> to all of you; especially to Thornton that is &#x201C;coming to Scotland.&#x201D; Our ad<hi rend="italic">s</hi> then (after Saturday) is &#x201C;Craigenputtoch Dumfries.&#x201D; Write to us so<supplied>[on]</supplied> good news if the Fates will! <closer><salute>I am ever, / My Dear Sir, / Yours most truly, /</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Before flying off, which we are minded to do next tuesday, I must send you a word. You know where our Address will be; I only remind you that now the season for it enters.</p>
<p>A week ago I sent up all your Books to Tait, who engaged the day before yesterday that they should be more effectually packed, and despatched by Steam on Wednesday (this day), with a Twopenny Letter advertising you of their address and arrival: so pray act accordingly. As Tait is a very punctual man, I can flatter myself all this has been accomplished; I will ascertain it, however, before my departure, and apprise you if anything have failed. Could I once hear that you had got that other Packet out of the India-House labyrinth, it were all well. The Books sent on this last occasion were: <hi rend="italic">Thiers</hi> (10 voll., one broken in the back, and which <hi rend="italic">was</hi> so); <hi rend="italic">English in France</hi> (3 voll.); and I think six Numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Repository</hi>,&#x2014; all that I had.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Thiers, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330112-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-01-12">12 Jan.</date></ref>: Carlyle also refers to Constantine Henry Phipps, Marquis of Normandy (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>), <hi rend="italic">The English in France</hi>, 3 vols. (London, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>).</note> A brief <hi rend="italic">invoice</hi> went with them; on the back of it your address. The Fraser Packet I still expect to get here, before setting off.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">influenza</hi> has not seized us; we had enough of mischief without it. On the whole, I have learned nothing this winter; scarcely once indeed heard a thought which seemed to have any the smallest significance: however, there was Contradiction in abundance; and Contradiction itself is a kind of instruction. I feel as if in spite of Morpheus himself I had laid in considerable matter for thinking of; as if in the very Darkness I have had to drink my fill of there lay the possibility of clearer light. The men are <hi rend="italic">all stupid</hi> with an inconceivable stupidity? Well, grant that; learn to know it, and how to deal with it. <hi rend="italic">This</hi> world, and no other, was the world thou hadst to work in: kick not against the pricks;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Acts 9:5.</note> smite where it is softer.</p>
<p>At some moments I have the sickliest misgivings about the vocation of Literary Man, of Speculative Man at all, in this epoch; I dream of bursting out into quite another sort of Activity: this will require the maturest deepest deliberation. God send me sight! Once on the right way, you fear nothing: the Devil and the world at his back cannot <pb id="pg-06-377" n="06:377"/>prevent you advancing thereon,&#x2014;as far as your strength will carry you; which is exactly as far as need be.</p>
<p>Yesterday in some Newspaper I saw a sentence quoted from the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository</hi> about Books and Men, which was curiously emblematic of my own late thoughts. If it was not you that wrote it (which I fear), then there must be another Mystic in England, whose acquaintance I should gladly make.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill wrote on <date when="1833-05-18">18 May</date> to say that the passage referred to was from his review &#x201C;Writings of Junius Redivivus,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository</hi>, new series, VII (<date when="1833-04-00">April 1833</date>), 262&#x2013;70: &#x201C;so there is not evidence therein of &#x2018;another Mystic&#x2019;; so much the worse.&#x201D; The second paragraph of the article is heavily steeped in Carlyle&#x2019;s influence.</note></p>
<p>Hayward&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> is not nearly so bad as I thought it would be: considered as a matter of <hi rend="italic">Business</hi>, he has really done it most handsomely, and his Book (glossarially) is worth <hi rend="italic">something:</hi> there is even here and there a touch of <hi rend="italic">elegance</hi>; and no mistakes (which Dictionaries, Consultations or the like could remove) of any moment. The Prolegomena are very perfect in their kind; altogether worthy of our &#x201C;cleverest second-rate man,&#x201D; and will do good as far as they go.&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> original <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> is now come; I am to begin reading it tomorrow.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330321-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-03-21">21 March</date></ref>. Carlyle&#x2019;s hitherto unpublished review of Hayward&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> follows this letter.</note></p>
<p>In Literature, I rather predict, nothing considerable will or can be done, for a long long while. Economically it is utterly embarrassed, the Bookseller System being more and more clearly dead and done: spiritually it is no less embarrassed, for I defy you, at this day, strive as you will, to think of anything but one black, barren, galling fixed-idea: the Death-Birth of the World;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320218-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1832-02-18">18 Feb. 1832</date></ref>; <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March 1833</date></ref>; &#x201C;Characteristics,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 16&#x2013;17. The Phoenix concept was much in Carlyle&#x2019;s mind at this time.</note>&#x2014;wherein, for the time, speculation is not wanted, but prompt practical insight, and courageous action. What is our inference from that? There are days when I could determine to turn my back on the whole sickening really painful scene of Hunger and Hollowness, and fly to America, where the people have at least something to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> and to <hi rend="italic">do</hi>.</p>
<p>But the thing I now have to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> is fold up this sheet. You have now two Letters&#x2014;of a sort: pray delay not. Take care of the influenza; think of <date when="1833-08-00">August</date> and us.</p>

<p>Our good Hayward says it was Charles Lamb that indirectly first put him on this enterprise. Lamb had been heard to remark that of all Translations of the Greek Tragedians those bald literal Latin ones, for the use of schools, produced the deepest impression on him.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hayward wrote in the &#x201C;Translator&#x2019;s Preface&#x201D; to the first (privately printed) edition: &#x201C;It [the translation] was first suggested to me by a remark made by M<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Charles Lamb to an honoured friend of mine [H. F. Cary]: that he had derived more pleasure from the meagre Latin versions of the Greek tragedians, than from any other versions of them he was acquainted with.&#x201D;</note> A remark most pertinent most just; which indeed properly is now second-hand and much older than Lamb; and may be read, for instance, in Johnsons Lives of the Poets, as recording the experience of some worthy in regard to the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnson had written in his &#x201C;Pope&#x201D;: &#x201C;I have read of a man, who being, by his ignorance of Greek, compelled to gratify his curiosity with the Latin printed on the opposite page, declared that from the rude simplicity of the lines literally rendered, he formed nobler ideas of the Homerick Majesty than from the laboured elegance of polished versions.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Lives of the English Poets</hi>, ed.

<p>Two considerable services Mr Hayward has rendered: a negative and a positive; the former tho&#x2019; only negative were itself no small one. It is now some ten years that Lord Leveson Gower&#x2019;s Translation of Faust to the scandal of all adepts nay to the misleading of innumerable non-adepts<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Francis Leveson Gower&#x2019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> had been published in London, <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>.

Carlyle&#x2019;s was, and is, an accepted view of this translation.</note> has had its course here<supplied>[.]</supplied> first both by demonstration and by experiment it has been made manifest to whosoever wears eyes in his head what quality the said so-called poetical Performance is of. Hayward as man of the robe and wig, is master of judicial logic, adroit in banter: not only exhibiting the real Faust (tho&#x2019; the stripped and leafless Faust at least the not <hi rend="italic">un</hi>real <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>) but at great length by comparison and critical citation has in the handsomest way dissected the spurious Faust, and left it lying so that he who runs may read<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Habakkuk 2:2.</note> and value it. A painful service, but a necessary one; and now at length finally <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. Reviewers of great and of small name did indeed make significant wry mouths over Lord Leveson&#x2019;s work: but none found in his heart to say out aloud, what is here with all courtesy and yet to the understanding of the dullest said or rather shown and left unsaid: that of all English poetical Translations extant, past or to be expected Lord Leveson&#x2019;s of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> is probably the worst&#x2014;that saw a second edition. This in a Country, which pleads guilty of Hoole and Company<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hoole (<date when="1727-00-00">1727</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>), translator of Tasso&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem Delivered</hi> (<date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>) and Ariosto&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Orlando Furioso</hi> (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>).

It is written fools rush in where angels fear to tread:<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pope, <hi rend="italic">Essay on Criticism</hi>, l. 625.</note> and surely when we consider it if ever there was an astonishing phenomenon in Literature it was that of a very young man, not yet rightly able <supplied>[to]</supplied> read one of Mr Rowbotham&#x2019;s Florileges,<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to John Rowbotham&#x2019;s three anthologies for students, the text on one page and an English translation on the opposite: <hi rend="italic">Deutsches Lesebuch; or, Lessons in German Literature</hi> (London, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>); <hi rend="italic">Cours de Litt&#xE9;rature Fran&#x26;ccedil;aise</hi> (London, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>); and <hi rend="italic">Lectiones Latinae</hi> (London, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>).

A daring attempt; a criminal one if you will; but what then? for had Korah &#x26;c <hi rend="italic">known</hi> what they were doing, would they have done it? Happier than Korah Dathan or Abiram, the young Adventurer yet survives unswallowed; and more, what ought to cover all sins, expresses a becoming contrition.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, after their rebellion against Moses and Aaron, were destroyed by the earth opening to swallow them. See Num. 16:1&#x2013;35.</note> Let his Lordship <supplied>[be]</supplied> heartily forgiven<supplied>[,]</supplied> his poetical Faust declared an air, hence forth let no man, not even the oldest woman, in speaking of Goethe remain ignorant that Lord Leveson&#x2019;s Translation is non-extant; and herewith once for all the whole matter be abolished.</p>
<p>And now knowing that we know nothing of Goethe&#x2019;s Faust (which is a real increase of knowledge) the question for English readers curious about the &#x201C;Apocalypse of this Era&#x201D; is what can be known? In regard to that second or positive service the Translation into English Prose has done somewhat; alas, that it is not all, that it is not much, the Translator knows better than a thousand of his critics. Of a true Poem what can the Prose Translation be but at best the naked trunk and boughs, so rigid wintry-looking, without the green rustling balminess of leaves! Nay farther as respects this case: in large sections of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> the meaning is more like a melody an inarticulate music, soul-searching sense-entrancing enough; so that the mere articulate words [crossed out: &#x201C;sense&#x201D; written] often in the highly difficult to decipher would do little for us tho&#x2019; we had them. They are like the separate notes; but transposed, thrown out of joint, the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> quite lost; the rhythm the movement wholly wanting, to be supplied according to force of fancy. What then? Take thankfully what of the original we get; know ever how much is not there; above all bless ourselves that nothing <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of the original <hi rend="italic">is</hi> there. Under such limitations does the Prose Translator work. Neither, so long as we read the Hebrew Bible in English, let us say that he can accomplish little; let us venture to say what he can <hi rend="italic">not</hi> accomplish.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-381" n="06:381"/>To friend Hayward in this enterprize, there were two sorts of requisites<supplied>[:]</supplied> meditation<supplied>[,]</supplied> appropriation of his original without which all lexicons and scholia avail nothing; but then also extraneous means helps, deep long-continued consultations, researches, inquiries, learned glosses<supplied>[,]</supplied> for much of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> never so well translated needs commentary.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hayward, after complaining in his &#x201C;Translator&#x2019;s Preface&#x201D; of the dearth of commentary on problems in <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, states that he has &#x201C;endeavoured to supply this deficiency by bringing together all the information I could collect amongst a pretty extensive circle of German acquaintance&#x201D; and that he has &#x201C;also ransacked all the commentaries I could get.&#x201D;</note> As concerns the latter we have all praise to give him: his assiduity has been most meritorious; friends German and English, far and near, among whom are such authorities as Grimm and Schlegel<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the &#x201C;Translator&#x2019;s Preface&#x201D; Hayward thanked both Jacob Grimm and A. W. von Schlegel.</note> have been consulted and give response: if somewhat yet remains, there is no risk in saying that so much was never before done. To the un-German reader these Notes are essential; nay more, among the most German of English readers there is perhaps not one who will not find elucidation there.</p>
<p>Farther we say measuredly that to most British readers the Translation itself will be of true service. The Translator has shown the laudablest fidelity of purpose, has paused, has diligently examined; so far as perspicacity and logical clearness would carry him has triumphed. His version sticking close to the original has a kind of anxious correctness; in parts too a graceful expressiveness; if dimness, a certain air of dislocation rest<supplied>[s]</supplied> over other parts; how was it, with such opportunities, to be helped? The Reviewer<supplied>[,]</supplied> an old student of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi><supplied>[,]</supplied> here holds himself bound to testify that he has read &#xBE; of the English Faust, in close comparison with the German, and with many real felicities <supplied>[and]</supplied> but a few immediately-remediable shortcomings, was able to detect no unquestionable error of moment. Under the last head which does not include half a dozen the worst was but this: <foreign>Die Gegenwart</foreign> [the present]&#x2014;meaning as we believe <supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied>the present time <hi rend="italic">by</hi> a fellow of ability<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied>; not &#x201C;the presence of a brave boy,&#x201D; which in that context will simply mean nothing.<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Carlyle&#x2019;s comments on this phrase, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340428-TC-JSB-01">TC to JSB, <date when="1834-04-28">28 April 1834</date></ref>.</note> [The others (for we may as well give them all) are &#x26;c.]<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not listed in the MS. Carlyle may have intended to insert them later if he published the review. The brackets are Carlyle&#x2019;s.</note> Add now that the Book is valued at twelve shillings, is of excellent paper and type; that Faust is considerably the <hi rend="italic">strangest</hi> thing written in Europe for some three <pb id="pg-06-382" n="06:382"/>or four generations; (all <hi rend="italic">which</hi> assertions no mortal living will dispute us): and the reader knows now what he has to do.</p>
<p>On the whole, therefore is not this Book and the reception it seems to meet with a thing we can honestly look upon with welcome? A satisfaction that German Literature (which in one best sense may be said to mean Literature itself, in this epoch) spreads vigorously both in height and breadth, has its interpreters<supplied>[,]</supplied> its critics, and ever-increasing public; that one of the chief Products of G Literature need no longer be misknown, may now begin to be in some small degree known. Ten years that do much in many cases have in this worked wonders: a new influence may be said to have added itself to British Thought; where, as is easy to predict, its effects deep enough in their character can nowise be wanting.</p>
<p>If we go farther, and hint prophetically that perhaps in this little volume we see the symptom of a new era in British Translation generally, the reader will recoil from us: nevertheless he need not. British Translation is among the worst of all spiritual products on the face of this globe; how to contradict it, that with the single exception of our English Bible there is no good Translation of importance in our language.<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle praises elsewhere Coleridge&#x2019;s translation of the final two plays of Schiller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi> trilogy, and, as the finest translation from German into English, Sotheby&#x2019;s version of Wieland&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>. See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXV, 151.</note> In fact the whole principle spirit <supplied>[is]</supplied> wrong for this best of all reasons that it is simply not true. An Interpreter, one would think, were either one that explained (stood true) (exhibited) his original; or else were Nothing whatever. But with us the strangest idea has got abroad that we stand truest to the foreign Original, by clipping and torturing<supplied>[,]</supplied> by dy<supplied>[e]</supplied>ing and dizening it to look something like a native! Pope&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Belle Infidele</hi> [beautiful unfaithful]<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis-Clair de Beaupoil Sainte-Aulaire (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), French politician and diplomat, translated <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> in <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>. The <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle Biographie G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale</hi> (Paris, <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), comments thus on him: &#x201C;<foreign>Comme traducteur, M. de Sainte-Aulaire est du syst&#xE8;me des <hi rend="italic">belles infid&#xE8;les</hi>, car &#x2018;en essayant, disait-il, de conserver &#xE0; la traduction la couleur de l&#x2019;original, le traducteur arrive &#xE0; un effet tout diff&#xE9;rent: il donne un air &#xE9;tranger &#xE0; ce qui en allemand &#xE9;tait naturel et facile</foreign>&#x2019;&#x201D; (XLIII, 136).</note> might be tolerated as a Hetaera: but so many thousand thousand altogether <hi rend="italic">un</hi>lovely jilts (wretched trulls &#x26; trollops offensive to eye and to nose) are melancholy proof to what length we have carried it. So far as we know this inconsiderable volume is the first English one in which the true principle of Translation has been fairly avowed and acted on: this namely that before all other considerations, the first second and third requisite (to which <hi rend="italic">all</hi> others must be sacrificed) is closeness, <pb id="pg-06-383" n="06:383"/>utmost possible resemblance. (Shall the Portrait-painter give us Ibrahim Pasha<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1493-00-00">1493</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1536-00-00">1536</date>), Turkish grand vizier; or, more likely (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), Egyptian general and viceroy.</note> in the coat and air of a London Alderman; or Agame<supplied>[m]</supplied>n<supplied>[on]</supplied> armed with horse-pistols?) Such is the principle this little volume both acts on, and theoretically vindicates, reminding <supplied>[one]</supplied> for instance <supplied>[of]</supplied> M. G. St Aulaire, who declares all what is not logically clear must be altered into clearness, that it is as much as saying the &#x201C;moon&#x2014;.&#x201D;<note n="24" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hayward had commented that Sainte-Aulaire had &#x201C;given a clever and spirited, but vague and loose, paraphrase of the poem, instead of a translation of it.&#x201D; He quotes at length from Sainte-Aulaire&#x2019;s Preface in his Translator&#x2019;s Preface (lxvi&#x2013;lxix) and ends: &#x201C;&#x2018;<foreign>j&#x2019;ai tout subordonn&#xE9; &#xE0; l&#x2019;expression claire et pr&#xE9;cise du sens que j&#x2019;avais choisi</foreign>,&#x2019; As well might a painter say:&#x2014; &#x2018;The moon looks best when struggling through clouds, and it was my duty to paint her surrounded by them. But I had no paint fit for clouds in my box; therefore, I have painted her without any, and, therefore, my duty is performed.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>It may be information to some that the <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> here translated, and long treated as a whole by British and other Reviewers is nevertheless but a fragment; the first act of a whole consisting of five acts. Some have heard of <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi>; that was the third act<supplied>[;]</supplied> indeed the whole four acts are not much larger than the first alone. We state now that the whole work published some months ago has reached Britain, lies here beside us; as completed by its author the year before his decease.<note n="25" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eckermann had probably sent Carlyle the first volume of Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Nachgelassene Werke</hi> (Stuttgart and T&#xfc;bingen, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), which contained the second part of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> (vol. 41 of the Cotta edition of <hi rend="italic">Goethes Werke</hi>).</note> Beyond the <foreign><hi rend="italic">dramatis personae</hi></foreign> we have not yet had time to go: but that seems promising enough. There is reason to hope that the Diabolic Tragedy now perfect and fully compacted may prove worthy of all study; the highest work of Art, properly <hi rend="italic">the</hi> work of Art belonging to its Era; and give rise to new Translations not only of the true-prose sort but even of the true poetical.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>If you arrive as you anticipated, at Paris on the <date when="1833-05-20">20<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>, this Letter again will be too late. A consummation which I have striven honestly to prevent; but, as you see, and shall hear, without effect. Excuse this limited size of paper too; for at present I am in the transition-state, and divided from my tools. On Tuesday morning gone a week, our places were all secured in the Thornhill Coach, the baggage happily despatched the week before: but by the foolishest misunderstanding we found on reaching the North Bridge at half past six, that the Coach was <hi rend="italic">gone</hi>&#x2014;three minutes ago! There was nothing for it, but wearisomely waiting two days longer; to which painful side of the alternative we reconciled ourselves the best way possible; lying literally hidden, unknown to all our friends except two; scarcely stirring out except at nightfall, and then very much with the feeling of <foreign><hi rend="italic">r&#xE9;venans</hi></foreign> [ghosts].</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-385" n="06:385"/>I bathed twice in the Forth; read a <hi rend="italic">Life of Paul Jones</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Rear-Admiral Paul Jones &#x2026; now first compiled from his original journals and correspondence</hi>, 2 vols.

One incident that most of all reconciled me to the disappointment was the arrival (some two hours after our return) of your Florence Letter, which otherwise we must have waited for, and run the risk of losing, for it had already been at Dumfries, and might not, without hesitation, have been sent back. I determined to write forthwith; yet not till I had seen the Scotsbrig people, and could tell you a positive tale. Well on Thursday we did all happily get off, and, after a stifling stew of nine dusty hours, were set down at Glendinning&#x2019;s,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Glendinning kept the Queensberry Arms, Thornhill.</note> all alive, but Jane utterly sick, hardly able to move hither in any fashion, and seized, as it soon appeared, with this universal <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi>, which has held her in confinement, generally in bed, ever since. We sent the maid over to Craigenputtoch, but no one else has yet been over there. It was Monday morning (for Mrs Welsh too had taken the <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi>) before I could get off for Scotsbrig; writing there I found impossible (for want of time, and even of paper); and it was only yesternight that I returned. Happily, however, after this tedious preamble, I am enabled to inform you that all is quite well in Annandale, that all in Nithsdale is improving and hopeful; and so in the end your heart is set at rest.</p>
<p>The Monday when I set off with Harry and the Gig was a quite beautiful day, and every thing that occurred was of a kind to render thanks for. After the meekest of drives, down AE<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the River Ae, see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260106-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:3</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1826-01-06">6 Jan. 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note> water and the rest of them, Catlinns house, whitewashed and hospitable, rose on me over <hi rend="italic">White-Ween Hass</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Probably the local pronunciation of Whitewoolen-hass, a hill close by Catlinns&#x201D; (Mary Aitken Carlyle&#x2019;s note quoted by Norton).</note> about 3 o&#x2019;oclock [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]; and in a few minutes more Alick, hastening home from his potatoe ground, had his tea-table covered for me, and question and answer was in full progress. He approves himself a most shifty judicious husbandman on that bare field; pays his rent, goes resolutely on, with none save the humblest hopes; and really, in all senses, seems to be doing <hi rend="italic">well</hi>. His little girl is quite a beauty of a child, with which in his own way he makes infinite diversion; she more than anything else reconciles him to his home, and his task; and so he fights his battle, and makes himself ever the readier to fight it, or fight a better one. He reyoked me, drove me on to Banks Hill; where meeting Jamie Austin, with carts coming to <pb id="pg-06-386" n="06:386"/>help him, he turned and bade me good-b&#x2019;ye till the morrow evening. At Scotsbrig they had heard my wheels in time; my Mother was running out to meet as of old; I could thank God that here too I found everything well. Our Mother seems better rather than worse in bodily health; seems patient, contented, even cheerful. The rest of them seem to go on quite tolerably; all in good agreement, in good heart, and proper behaviour. Jamie, especially when he gets into the <hi rend="italic">biographic</hi> department, is very clever and amusing. There was seldom such a crop seen as last all over Scotland, at Scotsbrig especially: so, tho&#x2019; wages and prices are low, they contrive to make the two meet, and have no complaint to make. Indeed in Annandale one sees far less of that &#x201C;Foreshadow of <hi rend="small-caps">Ruin</hi>,&#x201D; which seems to envelope our devoted sinful and miserable Isle, than in most other quarters I have examined. The great continual emigration to America keeps our Country from taking <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>. To finish off several things, I must mention that I had to read your Letter over <hi rend="italic">twice;</hi> that there was but one feeling among men women and children, the feeling of joy at your prosperity and speedily expected return. The &#x201C;guinea&#x201D; had been given to old Pool,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Pool of Borgue, an Annandale schoolmaster.</note> now very frail; I became bound for it, but they would not have the payment. Our Mother, in addition to her best blessing, charged me to mention that she had sent many times to the Post-office, in hope of that Letter you &#x201C;would perhaps write,&#x201D; and with great regret at finding none. They desired to be instantaneously apprised of your arrival on British ground. This must conclude my Scotsbrig budget.</p>
<p>Edward Irving had preached in &#x201C;Graham&#x2019;s park&#x201D; in the Langlands, and excited a very great sensation. Little of him since has transpired; he is said to be expected back ere long. But what will shock you not a little is perhaps still to be told: the death of poor George, his Brother! It stands announced in last week&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Courier;</hi> I had heard before that he was dangerously ill, of inflammation of the lungs; but could learn nothing positive till Graham of Burnswark, on Tuesday evening, told me the fatal issue. Poor good George! I have lamented much over him, and shall lament much: I see still his tall figure coming up from the New Road yonder, and must now fancy him forever motionless in a London Churchyard.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He died on <date when="1833-05-08">8 May</date>.</note> Such too is <hi rend="italic">our</hi> tenure of existence here: let us be wise while it is called Today. The Irving family are indeed no longer what they were: the children scattered abroad, in death, or in various difficulty; the Father taken away; the Mother <pb id="pg-06-387" n="06:387"/>(as I hear) fallen into dotage, and sheltered with her daughter Elizabeth somewhere in Lancashire.&#x2014;&#x2014; I have mentioned Graham in this paragraph. Let me add only that we saw him for the first time six weeks ago in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; that he is now re-settled at Burnswark, at least for the summer; done with his American; for the rest well and cheerful; accepts your apology,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For not writing.</note> and zealously desires to hear news of you face to face. James Johnston (<hi rend="italic">Targer</hi>) also came to see us, from Haddington, a few weeks ago: he has grown bald, has had much sickness in his family; otherwise looks and talks and acts with the same honest composure as of old. He too was very friendly in his inquiries for you<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>As to ourselves, I must now mention in the first place that the &#xa3;140 you spoke of<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his last letter.</note> had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come to the Commercial Bank yesterday; so if there is any danger of mischance, look to it. This forms almost all my <hi rend="italic">business;</hi> the rest is speculation. I left Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> with the grieved heart customary to me on visits thither; a wretched <hi rend="italic">infidel</hi> place; not one man that could forward you cooperate with you in any useful thing; scarcely one I could find (except Sir W. Hamilton) that could speak a sincere word. The deep ignorance in which even ingenious people live, such as Gordon, Aird and the like, is almost inconceivable; never did the wretched <hi rend="italic">sp&#xEA;w</hi> (spue) of Blackwoodism, on which these people nourish themselves, seem so wholly detestable. But as old Grange said, &#x201C;they can di the&#x2019; neither ill na good.&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280420-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:369</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1828-04-20">20 April 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> Peace be with them, and furtherance to whatever good they aim at! I bought several Books in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; carried back with me materials enough for reflexion, the very contradictions, even unjust ones, you meet with are elements of new progress. My presence there was honoured with many a kind civility too; was publickly acknowledged by a kind of Lampoon,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced.</note> laudativo-vituperative (as it ought to be) by one Brown Editor of a Newspaper,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. James Browne, LL.D. (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), editor of the <hi rend="italic">Caledonian Mercury</hi> from <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>, and (at various times) of the <hi rend="italic">Scots Magazine</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">North Briton</hi>; had trained for the ministry at St. Andrews, been private tutor, then classical master at Perth Academy; studied for bar and became advocate, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>.</note> whom I have known only at a distance, and as a blustering <foreign>Bubbly jock</foreign> [turkey gobbler], much given to <hi rend="italic">fabrication</hi>. On the other hand, I relieved Professor Wilson from the necessity of fabricating any more in my behalf, by decidedly <hi rend="italic">cutting</hi> him the day before we left town. I was quite wearied with the man, his deep desire to <pb id="pg-06-388" n="06:388"/>be familiar with me, his numerous evasions to meet me, his lies to excuse these; and so, in mere christian charity, brought it to an end. My feelings to him remain, I hope, unchanged, as much as I can make them: admiration for a very superior talent, for many gleams of worth and generosity; contempt, pity for his cowardice, for his want of spiritual basis, which renders all his force a self-destructive one, properly no force at all. Thus did I finish off with Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, not in the most balsamic fashion. If I go back, it shall be at worst with indifference; and at best, I doubt, with little more. And now here once more are we, stranded again on the wold (where we hope to be next monday) with intent to pass another summer there. We are not out of funds; we are free from debt, have liberty to live and let live. A Paper on <hi rend="italic">Diderot</hi> was printed about a month ago; character not known. Fraser has just sent me Proofs of a <hi rend="italic">Cagliostro</hi>, one of the most distorted bad things (not to be <hi rend="italic">false</hi>) I ever wrote; probably the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> in that style. These two worth near &#xa3;100, the payment of which I reckon sure, form my present disposable capital. My chief project for the summer is to cut Teufelsdreck into slips, and have it printed in Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine: I have not proposed it to him yet, and must go warily to work in that, for I have spoiled such things already by want of diplomacy. It will be worth almost &#xa3;200 to me that way, and I shall get rid of it, which otherwise there is little hope of to <hi rend="italic">any</hi> purpose and without great loss; the Book-trade being still dead,&#x2014;and as I reckon forever. I have much reading too, much thinking; prospects of more <hi rend="italic">society</hi> than last year: so we shall wait in a kind of <hi rend="italic">rest. &#x201C;<foreign>Halte still und seh&#x2019; Dich um</foreign></hi> [stop and look around]&#x201D;: that is every way my posture at present. Outwardly and inwardly a kind of closing of the First Act goes on with me; the second as yet quite <hi rend="italic">un</hi>opened. The world is fast changing, the ways and wants and duties of the world; I myself am also or ought to be changing: there must be a readjustment. On the whole, Doctor, when I consider it, there is no portion of my environment that so cheers me, as the outlook on <hi rend="italic">thy</hi> side. Yes truly, my brave Jack, I begin to feel that thou art my Brother. These sentiments, that manner of proceeding and determining are <foreign><hi rend="italic">ganz aus meiner Seele</hi></foreign> [straight from my own soul]: I feel myself very <hi rend="italic">rich</hi> that I have such a Brother, that I shall not be alone in this so lonely world. All good and manful things are now not so much to <supplied>[be]</supplied> prophecied of you (this I always have done) as discerned in you in clear promise. Yes, my Boy, give thanks to God that by dark ways He has led thee into light. We will front the world together, &#x201C;knowing it, despising it, loving it, cheerfully holding on our <pb id="pg-06-389" n="06:389"/>way thro&#x2019; it, our eye on higher loadstars.&#x201D;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the last sentence &#x201C;Count Cagliostro,&#x201D; the proofs of which Carlyle had been reading. See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 318.</note> Thank God that it can be so! And now I will give you leave to become I say not one of the most famous, but one of the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> Physicians in all the British Isle, and so to play a man&#x2019;s part in God&#x2019;s world<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>The fag-end of this poor sheet (my ink and furniture everyway are wholly pitiable) must be employed in settling about London addresses. You will find Holcroft in 13. Bartlett&#x2019;s Buildings, Holborn, and from him, or at the Athenaeum learn Badams&#x2019;s address, whom pray neglect not to see. Mill (<hi rend="italic">John</hi> Mill) is every day till 4 o&#x2019;clock at the India House, very near where poor Strachey used to be: every one knows him. I will give warning of your approach. Glenn I have quite lost; I enclosed him a Letter, but Mill could not make him out; I advised a trial at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn; <hi rend="italic">do not</hi> miss him. Irving, I believe, <hi rend="italic">lives</hi> too in Newman Street Oxford Street. William Fraser Mill can tell you of. This is all that I can think of for London.&#x2014;&#x2014; With regard to Paris I should have much to ask; but what room is there? I have read a good deal about the new French people within this year, their old Revolution, &#x26;c &#x26;c: a most <hi rend="italic">mixed</hi> business. The Trial of the St. Simonians, read since I came hither, exceedingly amazes me; interests me for it is a <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1832-12-27">27 Dec. 1832</date> Mill had told Carlyle that he had ready to send a copy of the trial of the St.-Simonians, <hi rend="italic">Religion Saint-Simonienne.

<p>Waugh is perhaps scarcely worth writing to.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I send you down two Books, and along with them a little announcement of our arrival and existence here. Being in the greatest haste, a few words must suffice.</p>
<p>That <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> is distinguished by nothing but by being the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Number; otherwise one of the stupidest Books I ever looked into in this world. You may try whether you can find aught in it to suit you. But the other Book, again, will not fail to interest you a little: the first Paper, that on &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Diderot</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, XI (<date when="1833-04-00">April 1833</date>), 261&#x2013;315.</note> is by a son of yours. For the rest, you have only to keep the two as <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> as you can, and we shall get them back when you have done with them. Alick will perhaps like to see <hi rend="italic">Diderot</hi> too; in which case you must try to gratify him.</p>
<p>And now for my little announcement. We got here on Monday, as I had calculated; Jane still weak enough, but glad like me to get to any &#x201C;bit <foreign>hadding</foreign> [dwelling] of her ain fr&#x2019; a&#x2019; that.&#x201D; She was rather sick during the drive; but got fresher afterwards. We found everything about the House in Complete order; Nancy had been diligent; and <pb id="pg-06-391" n="06:391"/>Peggy Austin had kept out the damp with great success; indeed Jane says we never were <hi rend="italic">drier</hi>, and not the smallest thing has gone wrong. Peter too has the Garden all trimmed up as neatly as ever it was: so far as they go nothing could be more perfect than their performance. We have seen none of them yet: but are certainly bound to thank them heartily, &#x201C;besides payment.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The only thing of any consequence that has gone out of joint is one of the Plantations which M&#x2019;Adam&#x2019;s people have burnt, in burning their heather. The careless lumber! That men should plant and fence and laboriously rear shelter in this wilderness; and then a hash of hashes come and in one hour consume the fruit of 20 years industry! However, it is needless to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> anything about it. One comforting circumstance is that it was rather a bad Planting; tho&#x2019; here again unluckily, it lies close to us, in daily view: it is the one at the north end of the &#x201C;heathery park&#x201D;; between the Glaisters Hillside and the road; on your <hi rend="italic">left</hi> hand, as you set out from Stumpy to come hither. Joseph<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph M&#x2019;Adam (or Macadam), who was farming the land at Craigenputtoch. Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320629-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1832-06-29">29 June 1832</date></ref>.</note> was in a great <hi rend="italic">fuff</hi> about it, we learn; he also writes to Mrs Welsh that he will &#x201C;come good for it.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Good</hi> for it! Can he make these black scrags into green trees again? I have not seen him yet; but will.&#x2014; On the whole, I disturb myself comparatively little: what good shall I ever get of these woods at any rate? Be not careful over much.</p>
<p>The grass in our Field is all up and rough; Jamie may come up with his Colt when he likes: for I see no other use we can put the provender to, no gig-horse that we can <hi rend="italic">borrow</hi>, and I am minded to <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> none.</p>
<p>But, on the whole, my Dear Mother, I think it will be better for you to make an effort and come too, when there is travelling this way. We should like you very well, just now; and have even need of you. Jane is still very feeble (she had a wretched ill-turn of headache &#x26;c this very evening, not an hour ago); and there is no nurse but myself. I feel confident that she is getting strong again; but it may be weeks before she is as well even as she was.</p>
<p>There is meal enough here; some six stones, they say: but it is very <hi rend="italic">raw;</hi> and we want two stones of Scotsbrig meal to make porridge for ourselves. By the first opportunity, you can let us have it.</p>
<p>What if Sandy or Jamie should come up with you the very next Wednesday (which appears to be Whitsun Wednesday)? If you were at Dumfries that day there would be plenty of Carts up hither; but, <pb id="pg-06-392" n="06:392"/>indeed, I should not like to risk you, on such a principle, without Alick. Could I know of you, how easy were it to come down with the <hi rend="italic">Clatch</hi>. Consult with your two sons, and see what they will do.</p>
<p>I wrote to the Doctor from Thornhill; delivered him all your messages, and instructed him to apprise you whenever he set foot on British ground. If all go well, we shall hear of him in the course of the ensuing month.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had written to his mother from Paris on <date when="1833-05-20">20 May</date> that he hoped to be in London ten days later and at Scotsbrig by the middle of <date when="1833-06-00">June</date>.</note></p>
<p>At Dumfries I saw Uncle John; who reported all in their usual state. He himself is grown a little deafer.</p>
<p>Our Cow has not calved; but is <hi rend="italic">expected</hi>, they say, very soon.</p>
<p>I am now close on the end of this rigmarole; can only send you all my love, my continual good wishes. It was the truest pleasure I have had for many a day to see you all so quiet, composed and well-doing; both at Catlinns and Scotsbrig I felt that there was much reason to bless the Giver of Good that all <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was still left us. Continue to watch over your children, my dear Mother; and let us all continue to love and honour you. <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Jane had &#x201C;several little things&#x201D; to send: but, poor <foreign>lassie</foreign>, she is in bed; and I will not let her rise to seek them. Tell the other Jane to write&#x2014;directly unless you are coming.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Eliza</salute>

You know <hi rend="italic">my</hi> way of being always too early&#x2014;perhaps you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> know, that my Husband always puts off till the last moment&#x2014; this, almost the only, discrepancy in our habits has produced many little argumentations betwixt us which on that illfated morning I for the <hi rend="italic">first time</hi> determined to evade. Accordingly tho&#x2019; up in good time (indeed I did not close my eyes the whole night) dressed and breakfasted in good time, we somehow trifled away <hi rend="italic">five minutes</hi> over and above what there was to work on, and on reaching the starting place, bag and baggage, saw our &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Convenience</hi>&#x2019; (as M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Rennie used modestly to call her carriage)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Mrs. Rennie&#x201D; is George Rennie&#x2019;s mother.

Let us drop a veil over the disgraceful home-march! Enough to say that I was forthwith deposited in bed with the dreadful<supplied>[l]</supplied>est headach<supplied>[e]</supplied>, and remained there, most of the time we had to wait; glad my existence was unknown, that so I might be left in quiet. It was now too apparent to me that I had got Influenza; I only hoped that I might brave it out, and keep up till I was landed at <hi rend="italic">home</hi>. But I could get no further than Templand, after suffering by the way such misery as I shall not soon forget. There I had to keep my bed for a week&#x2014; My Mother too was laid up with it for three days, so I had the additional vexation of being looked on as a pestilence. On Monday I took the road again&#x2014;reached the goal of all my wishes, for the time being&#x2014;again had a bad turn that confined me in bed&#x2014;And only yesterday felt myself like living and today eat half of a salt herring to breakfast on the strength of which I write&#x2014; So confess that I have lost no time&#x2014;but on the contrary am displaying a most satisfactory ardour in the matter.</p>
<p>We found the house&#x2014;not merely standing but in the best order&#x2014; The Woman who had charge of it thro&#x2019; the winter had kept the damp out&#x2014;and Nancy had sorted it to a wonder without my superintendence. My Cow is at the point of calving&#x2014; My little horse is in high mettle&#x2014;my hens are fat and laying&#x2014;and all have returned from their <pb id="pg-06-394" n="06:394"/>diverse winter-quarters&#x2014;making together with ourselves a &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">reunion</hi>&#x2019; of the most Idyllic discription [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]! So far we have cause to be thankful. But as there is always some confounded drag on the contentment that is of this world&#x2014;so a spectacle presented itself on our return enough to have made a passionate person <hi rend="italic">explode</hi>. but me who am an example of patience and submission it only moved to tears. One of the woods (just think of it) the one on your left as you approach the house was burnt to cinders! a melancholy mass of blackened stumps, while all around was shining in new verdure. The Tenant had been burning heather&#x2014;the trees had caught fire&#x2014;and he simply retired into his house and left it to burn! O Eliza&#x2014;I could cry yet to think of this&#x2014;to think of my Father taking such a world of pains to plant these woods&#x2014;to think they have had rain and sunshine vouchsafed them for more than twenty years, to be finally consumed in one night thro&#x2019; the carelessness of a lout like Macadam. But he pays his rent, and that is everything&#x2014;the appearance of Craigenputtoch is of consequence only to <hi rend="italic">us</hi>. Well be it so! we shall not stay to see it reduced to its original desolation. I wish its improvement had not been my Father<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>s work, and then I should not care tho it were let on a nineteen years lease to the Devil himself.</p>
<p>One thing however I shall insist on&#x2014;namely that I should hereafter have the melancholy privelege [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of being <hi rend="italic">informed</hi> when my property is burnt or otherwise destroyed&#x2014;instead of having the fact concealed from me till it could be concealed no longer&#x2014;even my own servant commanded by my Mother not to tell me of it&#x2014; You see I am angry&#x2014;more so perhaps than becomes a pretender to some Philosophy&#x2014; But I am giving vent to my feelings on the occasion <hi rend="italic">here</hi> for the first time&#x2014;as a way of getting in some measure rid of them&#x2014; To turn to a more agreeable topic&#x2014; Will you give our affectionate regards to your Uncle; of whose kindness to us during our stay in town&#x2014;from the first day to the last (a sort of kindness so much after our own hearts&#x2014;) my Husband and I have many times gratefully commemorated&#x2014; Do you too my dear Eliza accept our kind remembrance of your kindness&#x2014; Write to me soon&#x2014;and love me always&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>On the Proofsheet of <hi rend="italic">Cagliostro</hi> I marked an announcement that you would hear from me soon. I write to-day in more confusion than is desireable; but rather so than lose another half-week.</p>
<p>Most probably you recollect the Manuscript <hi rend="italic">Book</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>.</note> I had with me in London; and how during that Reform hurlyburly, which unluckily still continues and is like to continue, I failed to make any bargain about it. The Manuscript still lies in my drawer; and now after long deliberation I have determined to slit it up into stripes, and send it forth in the Periodical way; for which in any case it was perhaps better adapted. The pains I took with the composition of it, truly, were greater than even I might have thought necessary, had this been foreseen: but what then? Care of that sort is never altogether thrown away; far better too much than too little. I reckon that it will be easy for the Magazine Printer to save me some thirty or forty complete Copies, as he prints it; these can then be bound up and distributed among my Friends likely to profit thereby; and in the end of all we can <hi rend="italic">re</hi>print it into a Book proper, if that seem good. Your Magazine is the first I think of for this object; and I must have got a distinct negative from you before I go any farther. Listen to me, then, and judge.</p>
<p>The Book is at present named &#x201C;Thoughts on Clothes; or Life and Opinions of Herr D. Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh D. U. J.&#x201D;; but perhaps we might see right to alter the title a little;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first reference to the &#x201C;whimsical title of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>&#x201D; appears to be in <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330718-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-07-18">18 July</date></ref>. &#x201C;D.U.J.&#x201D; probably means &#x201C;Doctor of Universal Jurisprudence.&#x201D;</note> for the rest, some brief Introduction <pb id="pg-06-396" n="06:396"/>could fit it handsomely enough into its new destination: it is already divided into three &#x201C;Books,&#x201D; and farther into very short &#x201C;Chapters,&#x201D; capable in all ways of subdivision. Nay some tell me, what perhaps is true, that taking a few chapters at a time is really the profitablest way of reading it. There may be in all some Eight sheets of <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>. It is put together in the fashion of a kind of Didactic Novel; but indeed properly <hi rend="italic">like</hi> nothing yet extant. I used to characterize it briefly as a kind of &#x201C;Satirical Extravaganza on Things in General&#x201D;; it contains more of my opinions on Art, Politics, Religion, Heaven Earth and Air, than all the things I have yet written. The Creed promulgated on all these things, as you may judge, is <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, and firmly <hi rend="italic">believed:</hi> for the rest, the main Actor in the business (&#x201C;Editor of these sheets&#x201D; as he often calls himself) assumes a kind of Conservative (tho&#x2019; Antiquack) character; and would suit <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> perhaps better than any other Magazine. The ultimate result, however, I need hardly premise, is a deep religious speculative-radicalism (so I call it for want of a better name), with which you are already well enough acquainted in me.</p>
<p>There are only five persons that have yet read this Manuscript: of whom two have expressed themselves (I mean convinced me that they <hi rend="italic">are</hi>) considerably interested and gratified; two quite <hi rend="italic">struck</hi>, &#x201C;overwhelmed with astonishment and new hope&#x201D; (this is the result I aimed at for souls worthy of hope); and one in secret discontented and displeased.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is an interesting problem who the five readers are. In the first place Carlyle may not be counting Jane (as hardly separate from himself) or Murray&#x2019;s reader (as too contemptible to bother with and certainly not &#x201C;secret&#x201D; about his discontent) or Jeffrey, who read only part of it and who had objections to &#x201C;the dilatoriness of the introductory part.&#x201D; It is certain that it was read by William Glen (<ref target="volume-06/lt-18311220-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-12-20">20 Dec. 1831</date></ref>) three times (<ref target="volume-06/lt-18330210-TC-JAC-01"><date when="1833-02-10">10 Feb. 1833</date></ref>), John Stuart Mill (<ref target="volume-06/lt-18311220-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-12-20">20 Dec. 1831</date></ref>); (JSM to TC, <date when="1833-09-05">5 Sept. 1833</date>, Mineka, XII, 176), and Henry Inglis (<ref target="volume-06/lt-18330210-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-02-10">10 Feb. 1833</date></ref>). Other possible readers were C. W. Dilke (<ref target="volume-06/lt-18320110-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-10">10 Jan. 1832</date></ref>), who apparently read it but could &#x201C;give me no light,&#x201D; and Charles Buller (same letter), who had the manuscript and &#x201C;who seemed anxious to see it.&#x201D; Of his brother John, TC says only, &#x201C;I wish you cld. have read my Book at this time&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-06/lt-18320216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-02-16">16 Feb. 1832</date></ref>).</note> William Fraser is a sixth reader, or rather half-reader; for I think he had only got half-way or so; and I never learned his opinion. With him, if you like, at this stage of the business you can consult freely about it. My own conjecture is that <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi>, whenever published, will astonish most that read it, be wholly understood by very few; but to the astonishment of some will add touches of (almost the deepest) spiritual interest, with others quite the opposite <pb id="pg-06-397" n="06:397"/>feeling. I think I can practically prophecy that for some six or eight months (for it must be published without interruption), it would be apt at least to <hi rend="italic">keep the eyes</hi> of the Public on you.</p>
<p>Such is all the description I can give you, in these limits: now what say you to it? Let me hear as soon as you can; for the time seems come to set these little bits of Doctrine forth; and, as I said, till your <foreign><hi rend="italic">finale</hi></foreign> arrive, I can do nothing. Would you like to see the <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. yourself? It can come, and return, by Coach for a few shillings, if you think of that: it will of course want the Introduction, and various other &#x201C;O. Y.&#x2019;s&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pretended &#x201C;notes&#x201D; by &#x201C;Oliver Yorke,&#x201D; one of the pseudonyms of William Maginn (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), editor of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">36</date>), also just used by Carlyle in the introduction and notes to his translation of Goethe&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Tale,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi>, VI (<date when="1832-10-00">Oct. 1832</date>), 257&#x2013;78. The penultimate sentence of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> reads: &#x201C;Thou too, miraculous Entity, who namest thyself YORKE and OLIVER, and with thy vivacities and genialities, with thy all-too-Irish mirth and madness, and odour of palled punch, makest such strange work, farewell; long as thou canst, fare-<hi rend="italic">well</hi>!&#x201D;</note> that will perhaps be useful. I need not remind you that about shewing it to any third party (as I have learned by experience) there is a certain delicacy to be observed: I shall like to hear from you first. Write to me, therefore, with the same openness as I have done to you; we shall then soon see how it lies between us.</p>
<p>I think the last <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> is among the best you have published for long. That Mirabeau man<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Author of &#x201C;Speeches Delivered in Banquo Reginae, Before Oliver, Lord Protector of the World of Letters, and a Jury of Fraserians: with notes and comments by Morgan Rattler. Mirabeau v. Macaulay <hi rend="italic">and others</hi>,&#x201D; VII (<date when="1833-05-00">May 1833</date>), 507&#x2013;26. The notes, etc., are by Percival Weldon Bankes (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">50</date>), who probably wrote the whole article.</note> (whom I seem not to know) is worth looking after. Your Speculations on poor Dr Chalmers and Economics<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sixth in a series &#x201C;On National Economy,&#x201D; a review of Dr. Thomas Chalmers, <hi rend="italic">The Supreme Importance of a Right Moral to a Right Economical State of the Community</hi>, by Maginn (VII, 603&#x2013;14).</note> generally always seize <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of the Truth, and far the better half: Chalmers and Company toil wearisomely with the other <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> half, and make sad work of it.&#x2014; Continue <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, and I still predict good for you.</p>
<p>My Brother, I keep hoping, will one day ere long walk in upon you: he ought to be at Paris by this time, on his way homeward.</p>
<p>Edinburgh seems worn down into a sad state of Stupidity and Hunger: God help it! The airs are fresh here, the trees of the green<hi rend="italic">est</hi>; and my cabbages flourish as briskly as Dioclesian&#x2019;s.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Diocletian (<date when="0245-00-00">245</date>&#x2013;<date when="0313-00-00">313</date>), Roman emperor (<date when="0284-00-00">284</date>&#x2013;<date when="0305-00-00">305</date>), celebrated for preferring his cabbages, planted with his own hands, to re-assuming imperial power (see Gibbon, <hi rend="italic">Decline and Fall</hi>, ch.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Will you read this to your young Artist;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thornton Hunt. Hunt had written to Carlyle on <date when="1833-05-28">28 May</date> (Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH</hi>, XLV, 453&#x2013;55): &#x201C;I snatch a hurried moment to write to you, because it is the first in which I am able to break my silence, Thornton not having had it in his power to state confidently at what time he could be prepared to set off. &#x2026; He now begs me to give his best respects &#x26; kind wishes, &#x26; say that he can set off whenever you give him signal. He comes by sea, because he thinks it will do good to his health, which has been very poor, especially of late; &#x26; I must add here, while I think of it, that his diet is of the most moderate description, &#x26; that we have no wine at our table. He is very glad, nay very anxious to come, &#x26; is making himself as much acquainted with you as possible by reading all such of your writings as he can get at. He has been long acquainted with Wilhelm Meister, has just read the article on Diderot, and is now in the midst of the Life of Schiller. &#x2026; Pray do not say that some day or other you shall succeed in &#x2018;tempting&#x2019; me to come to Scotland. It looks as if I did not wish it; which is very provoking, if you knew all. Thornton will tell you how delighted I should be to get a holiday with a friend,&#x2014;a<supplied>[n]</supplied> expectation<supplied>[?]</supplied> absolutely unknown to me; &#x26; he will <hi rend="italic">explain</hi> to you how <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> it is for me to do it.&#x201D;</note> and let him consider it as addressed equally to himself. The unfortunate Frank is bursting, or I should give you both better measure.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-399" n="06:399"/>Your Letter, tho&#x2019; dated <date when="1833-05-28">28<hi rend="italic">th</hi> May</date>, was only franked for the <date when="1833-06-04">4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of June</date>, and only arrived here yesternight. It has taken the longest possible time; so I lose none in saying that my friend Thornton will be welcome whenever he can set out. The following is for hi<supplied>[s</supplied> <foreign><supplied><hi rend="italic">c</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">arte de route</hi></foreign> [travel guide].</p>
<p>The cheapest sea-passage, and perhaps in good weather the pleasantest, is by a Leith Smack: these vessels lie about the Tower wharf; ask for the London &#x26; Leith Shipping Company,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably London &#x26; Leith Old Shipping Co. The smack sailed from London, Sundays and Thursdays, from the Leith and Berwick Wharf, Irongate.</note> in case there be any counterfeits. The voyager receives his berth beforehand; it is not likely to be crowded. Say four days brings him to Leith. If it is night, or towards night, he can stay on board till morning, and then equip himself there at leisure. If it is day, let him step ashore (trunk and all), and get into one of the Edinburgh &#x201C;stages&#x201D;; or failing that give some idle youth his luggage, and walk; it is only a mile.</p>
<p>Henry Inglis (pronounced Ingl<hi rend="italic">e</hi>s and the &#x201C;W.

This was Henry&#x2019;s own proposal, and I think ought to be accepted.&#x2014; Suppose now Edinburgh seen, the Traveller finds a Coach every alternate day (Tuesday is one) starting (from 2. Princes Street) for Dumfries and Thornhill: he takes out his place for Thornhill, is landed there about 3 in the afternoon; sees me (if I be duly warned); or in the other case, asks for Templand (a little furlong off), finds my Mother-in-law there apprised of his coming; and has landed <hi rend="italic">at home</hi>. Remark that our <hi rend="italic">only</hi> p<supplied>[ost]</supplied> day is Wednesday, the Monday night of London, the Tuesday night of Edinburgh. But Templand <hi rend="italic">always</hi> stands in the place.&#x2014; This as the Quakers say, seems &#x201C;the needful&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>We had been here, in the midst of sunshine, greenness, and the deepest quiet, for some ten days, when your long-expected Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1833-05-18">18 May</date>.</note> arrived as you calculated. I might have answered you sooner, for I have seldom been idler: but indeed that holiday stillness which descended on me when the dull and small and despicable discords of Edinburgh once lay behind, and I saw myself again dropped among the moors, was a thing so grateful to me, so wholesome-looking too, and withal so unusual, I could not find in my heart to interrupt it. You would smile if you saw my late employments; I myself could either weep or smile, but prefer to do the latter. This day again I was about rolling off for Annandale, to carry down my Mother who is visiting us here, and in hope to meet with my Brother or hear of him: but it proved a wet morning; so you have me for better or worse, and I shall the sooner have you. Imitate me in anything you like so to honour me in; only <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in my delays to write, when I fall into that sin.</p>
<p>You do well, and needfully, to vindicate your rights of <hi rend="small-caps">Me</hi>-<hi rend="italic">hood</hi>, having well admitted so many rights of <hi rend="small-caps">Thou</hi>-<hi rend="italic">hood</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written that he had found more to differ with in Carlyle&#x2019;s article on Diderot than he usually found in Carlyle&#x2019;s writings. He added that hitherto he had not been courageous enough in expressing the points on which he differed with Carlyle. &#x201C;Most of those whom I at all esteem and respect, though they may know that I do not agree with them <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi>, yet, I am afraid, think, each in their several ways, that I am considerably <hi rend="italic">nearer</hi> to agreeing with them than I actually am. &#x2026; So you see, I am only <hi rend="italic">about</hi> to have in all its fullness, that sincerity of speech for which you give me credit.&#x201D;</note> Every given <pb id="pg-06-401" n="06:401"/>man, if he be a man at all, looks at the world from a position in several respects his own peculiar one: let him look at it faithfully from thence, note faithfully and believe heartily what he <hi rend="italic">sees</hi> there. It will not contradict his as faithful brother&#x2019;s view, but in the end complete it and harmonize with it. &#x201C;Each man is the supplement of all other men&#x201D;: this is a saying worthy of entire acceptation. It was no secret to me that you and I differed over a whole half-universe of things, for indeed I think we stood at opposite sides of it: nevertheless I will by no means fancy with you that we are moving <hi rend="italic">from</hi> each other, but quite contrariwise. On the whole however when two men are agreed in recognising one another&#x2019;s common recognition of the infinite nature of Truth, there is the beginning of all profitable communion between them; and nothing is more interesting thenceforth than the friendly conflict of their differences. Hesitate not, I pray you, neither in this <date when="1833-08-00">August</date> nor at any other time, to show me the whole breadth and figure of your dissent; God knows I need guidance, both as to my own state and that of others, very much, and then it is hardly once in the twelvemonth that one hears the smallest true monition, any word of criticism worthy of aught other than instantaneous oblivion. About you I will not prophecy here; meanwhile I have my own anticipations, and in any conceivable case must watch you with deep interest.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are very wise in that self-seclusion you practice, in spirit-sickness of such a sort; yet also perhaps not.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written: &#x201C;I believe I am the least <hi rend="italic">helpable</hi> of mortals&#x2014; I have always found that when I am in any difficulty or perplexity of a spiritual kind I must struggle out of it by myself. &#x2026; I have never found any advantage in communion with others while my own mind was unsettled at its foundations, and if I am not much mended when my vacation-time comes round, I will rather postpone a meeting with you until I am.&#x201D;</note> There is inconceivable virtue in Silence, yet often also in wise communing of man with man. If you know any heart that can understand you, that has suffered the like of what you suffer, to that heart speak; the very act of such speaking brings assuagement, almost healing. I prescribe not as physician; but warn you that if you hide yourself in <date when="1833-08-00">August</date>, it will be <hi rend="italic">very difficult</hi> to find an excuse that can pass here. For the rest I may say, for your comfort, that such <hi rend="italic">relapses</hi> as yours appears to be are of common nay I believe of universal occurrence among the Faithful: on the blessed day of &#x201C;Conversion&#x201D; (this is still the only <pb id="pg-06-402" n="06:402"/>name I can give it) one&#x2019;s path seems thenceforward all plain and clear; nevertheless it proves nowise so; but a battle, of various fortune, to the last, wherein all the victory we look for is the heart to fight on. Thus too in the physical world, what is all <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> (or advancing), as the Mechanicians tell us but &#x201C;a succession of <hi rend="italic">falls</hi>&#x201D;?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Sir Walter Scott,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 30.</note> Will you understand me if I say there is still no Book in the whole world where I find the Spiritual Warfare of Man tenth-part so faithfully delineated, so cheeringly too, and instructively when once you have got to <hi rend="italic">read</hi> it, as in the Jewish <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>, well named the Book of Books? I protest, it is even so. In fine then I bid you go on unflinchingly, not resting till your &#x201C;Doubting-Castle&#x201D; Prison<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress</hi>, Part I, the castle of Giant Despair where Christian and Hopeful lie prisoners. In Part II the castle is destroyed by Greatheart.</note> is burst asunder; <hi rend="italic">love</hi> the Truth, and the Truth now as heretofore <hi rend="italic">will</hi> make you free.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 8:32.</note></p>
<p>Those Books came about a week before we left Edinburgh; were bundled off unopened to this Hermitage; and are now read, I think, every word of them. Is it of any importance that they be sent immediately? I believe I ought to admit that I have as good as done with them; yet some vague thought of turning them to farther advantage still lingers in me. A great result lies in these so intensely interesting Narratives; and <hi rend="italic">might</hi>, had one the faculty, be drawn out of them: this were what I should call the highest kind of writing, far higher than any Fiction even of the Shakspeare sort. For my own share I declare I now enjoy no other Poem than the dim, shadowy, as yet only <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> Poem, that hovers for me in every seen Reality. There is much here; of which I know not the limitations, the worth or unworth; meanwhile the feeling cleaves to me these many months, and seems decidedly to grow in me. Whereby at least you as my Book-provider may judge accurately of my actual taste in Books: I simply love all Books that offer me the Experience of any man or men, that give me any fraction of the History of men; on this side nothing can be more Catholic than my taste: but in return all Speculation is apt to be intolerable to me, except in two cases; where it is of the very highest sort; or where, as itself a historical document, I find it interesting for the sake of its interesting author. I doubt you will find intolerance here; but really how can I help it? I have wandered thro&#x2019; long dreary years in endless mazes of Speculation till my whole heart was sick; and hung sorites on sorites; and ended ever in Inanity: till at length the whole business was happily swept to the right and the left, and I found with amazement that the thing <pb id="pg-06-403" n="06:403"/>I wanted was not Telescopes and Optical Diagrams but <hi rend="italic">Eyes</hi> and things to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> with them. In any case, by all means, send me that <hi rend="italic">Poor Laws</hi> Book;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Extracts from the Information Received by His Majesty&#x2019;s Commissioners as to the Administration and Operation of the Poor Laws</hi> (London, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>).</note> adding to it, as your kind use is, all things you have within reach that point the same way.&#x2014;&#x2014; The St Simonian <hi rend="italic">Trial</hi> was better than any Drama I had read for years; that whole business, with d&#x2019;Eichthal&#x2019;s Letter,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both mentioned by Mill in his letter of <date when="1833-04-11">11</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-04-12">12 April</date>. Cf. also <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330517-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-05-17">17 May</date></ref>.</note> and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">vieille serviette</hi></foreign> [old napkin] about his ears in the Fauxbourg St. Antoine: all is at once a chimera and a truth. Poor Gustave! I love him better than I ever did, as he is seen there; neither will I ever despair of his fortunes outward or inward, when all these crudities (for him the nearest possible approach to <hi rend="italic">food</hi>) have been happily removed far from him&#x2014;part to the <hi rend="italic">larder</hi> (if you will forgive the figure), part to a much uglier place. But on the whole is not the French character, as shewn in these last two generations, in their Revolutions first and second, a very barren, very lean one? Never was a nation worse prepared with individual strength or light of any kind for a bursting asunder of all old bounds and habits; the old Sansculottes had only the strength to kill and to die: and then these new figures, with their Bankrupt Projector of a God-Man, and all this of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">femme libre</hi></foreign> [free woman], and their inability to speak <hi rend="italic">till</hi> she appear (and <hi rend="italic">vote</hi>, by ballot or otherwise)&#x2014;did the world often witness the like? I declare it is deeply interesting, yet lamentable exceedingly.&#x2014; I have read <hi rend="italic">Levasseur</hi>,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ren&#xE9; Levasseur (<date when="1747-00-00">1747</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires de R. Levasseur</hi> (<hi rend="italic">de la Sarthe</hi>), 2 vols. (Paris, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>); in fact the second volume appears to have been by Achille Roche (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>), who was fined and jailed when his work was officially condemned for &#x201C;outraging public morality, the principles of monarchy and above all religion.&#x201D;</note> as I said; but learned little from him: Thiers has most of it, in better state, already.
The man Levasseur seems but a quite common Radical, and it is fatal to the <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires</hi> that properly they are not his. But those of the <hi rend="italic">Prisons</hi>,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires sur les Prisons</hi>, 2 vols. (Paris, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>).</note> it was <hi rend="italic">there</hi> that I could &#x201C;sup full of horrors,&#x201D; and manifoldly interest and instruct myself. If you have anything more in any measure resembling them (tho&#x2019; of &#x201C;horrors&#x201D; I had perhaps more than enough) I shall be very thankful for it. <hi rend="italic">Madame Roland</hi> is but dim in me; her <hi rend="italic">French</hi> Memoirs I never saw, and the Translation many years ago; pray send the former if you have them.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marie Jeanne (Phlipon) Roland de la Plati&#xE8;re (<date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1793-00-00">93</date>), <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires</hi>, 2 vols. (Paris, <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>).</note> And so, enough of Books.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-404" n="06:404"/>However I have still to thank you for that Essay on <hi rend="italic">Endowments</hi>;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Corporation and Church Property,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">The Jurist</hi>, IV (<date when="1833-02-00">Feb. 1833</date>), 1&#x2013;26.</note> the Author of which I at once guess; as my Mother too does, far as it seems to lie out of her way: she and I approve of every word of it; she even carries down one of the copies to a certain Parish Parson a great stickler for the other side.&#x2014; Doubt not also that I carefully read your little Essay on Art.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;What Is Poetry?&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository</hi>, N.S., VII (<date when="1833-01-00">Jan. 1833</date>), 60&#x2013;70.</note> It is an honest considerate Essay: I do not properly dissent from anything in it; I would only add much to it. That characteristic you fix on is worthy of noting; I find in it indeed a kind of relationship with that old <hi rend="italic">Unconsciousness</hi> which as Goethe hinted to me is an element in most great things: however I do not figure it as the <hi rend="italic">great</hi> characteristic. Would I could help you forward! But no man is less versed in logical Defining than I of late years; and perhaps one may doubt whether Poetry is a thing that Science can <hi rend="italic">define</hi>. As for me I am accustomed to see some remains of meaning in that vulgarest of all notions that Poetry is Rhyme; and like almost better than any other form of speech to say to myself that Poetry is not poetical if it be not <hi rend="italic">Musical;</hi> if it be not in <hi rend="italic">thought</hi>, as in word, Music. This is not good in Logic, but it helps me a little to know at least myself what I mean. As for the Germans (or rather the Kanteans with Schiller at their head) they seem to insist much on this as the grand criterion of Poetry, of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunst</hi></foreign> [art] in any kind: that there be an <foreign><hi rend="italic">Unendlichkeit</hi></foreign> (Infinitude) in it. To me this at first had next to no meaning; but year after year it has got more: do you also try it, and I predict for you the like. There are great depths in that matter, which is well worth thought. We shall speak of it in <date when="1833-08-00">August</date>.</p>
<p>Did my Brother find you? His last Letter said you were not at the India House, that day he called: but he would try again. I am very anxious to see him, and what has become of him these last two years: I believe they have been <hi rend="italic">decisive</hi> for him.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Alas, here is the end!&#x2014; Ever affectionately Your&#x2019;s</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>I am very sorry to hear from Mrs Austin their purpose to remove to Germany; yet what can one advise? A.&#x2019;s is a hard case. Of Politics it would astonish you to find how little recollection I have there; me it quite gratifies. Fight they who esteem it an infinite Cause; there are plenty of such. The news of the Lord&#x2019;s Majority itself hardly <pb id="pg-06-405" n="06:405"/>dwelt half a minute with me, tho&#x2019; the Tory Informant looked wonders.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle held happily aloof from the outrage generally felt at Wellington&#x2019;s recent maneuvers in the House of Lords. Wellington had carried a motion (<date when="1833-06-03">3 June</date>), opposed to the wishes of the ministry, insisting on British neutrality in Portugal. There, Dom Pedro, father of the Portuguese queen and representative of constitutional government, was besieged in Oporto by his younger brother Dom Miguel, the absolutist usurper. In spite of Wellington, British sympathy in general lay with the constitutionalists.</note></p>
<p>Alas! alas! I have a stern tale to tell you of poor Glenn [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. He <hi rend="italic">is</hi> in Scotland; but in the saddest of all human states without crime. His Disease is deep, bodily and mental; whether without hope, or with it, and with what kind of it I will tell you when my own inquiries (thro&#x2019; obscure enough courses) have yielded. O Heaven! I cannot get the poor fellow out of my thoughts. What is it that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> complain of!</p>
<p>Do not say that a man&#x2019;s power of working is &#x201C;infinitesimally small&#x201D;; properly it is infinitely great, and goes thro&#x2019; all Eternity: to himself it is so, and to his Maker. For the rest, the Earth itself, with all its Mankind, is undoubtedly but a <hi rend="italic">mote</hi>.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written: &#x201C;The difficulty of comparing two magnitudes and distinguishing which is greatest, is as we all know, vastly enhanced when the magnitudes themselves are of almost infinitesimal smallness, and that unhappily seems to be the case at present with the portion of good, that one can see clearly a prospect of achieving in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> course that one can chuse.&#x201D;</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I here send you a batch of Literature; which I hope you will receive safe on Thursday. The &#x201C;Church Property&#x201D; Tract<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330613-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-06-13">13 June</date></ref>.</note> may now instruct Nivison,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Nivison (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), minister of Middlebie, the parish next to Ecclefechan.</note> or whoever is ignorant of its doctrine: I send you also a separate copy of <hi rend="italic">Diderot</hi>, which I got on Wednesday; tho&#x2019; now <pb id="pg-06-406" n="06:406"/>perhaps it is hardly worth so long a journey for you. There is one for Alick too.</p>
<p>The Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine does contain a kind of Likeness;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The pencil drawing of Carlyle by Daniel Maclise, published in the <date when="1833-06-00">June</date> issue of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>. Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-02-16">16 Feb. 1832</date></ref>.</note> liker than I expected. Jane specially claims the Number as hers; has got her name on it; and insists much that said title be <hi rend="italic">respected</hi>. I partly expect from Fraser another copy or two of the Picture; and shall not fail directly to send you one of them as <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>. The opposite <hi rend="italic">page</hi> will edify you very little; in fact, it is hardly intelligible (not at all so except to persons of the craft), but complimentary enough, and for so foolish a business may be considered as better than a wiser thing. The writer is one Dr Maginn, a mad rattling Irishman; of whom perhaps you have heard me speak. He wishes me well in his way; which indeed is very far from mine. So let us be thankful for all mercies.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;opposite <hi rend="italic">page</hi>&#x201D; (vii, 706) contains a description of Carlyle by William Maginn, not altogether accurate, which parodies his style. It begins: &#x201C;Here hast thou, O Reader! the-from-stone-printed effigies of Thomas Carlyle, the thunderwordoversetter of Herr Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.&#x201D; Other sentences read: &#x201C;Carlyle hath bestowed upon us the <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, and other works, so Teutonical in raiment, in the structure of sentence, the modulation of phrase, and the roundabout, hubble-bubble, rumfustianish (<foreign><hi rend="italic">h&#xfc;bble-b&#xfc;bblen, r&#xfc;mfustianischen</hi></foreign>), roly-poly growlery of style, so Germanically set forth, that it is with difficulty we can recognize them to be translations at all.&#x201D; &#x201C;To his credit be it spoken, he gave a Christian and an honourable tone to the articles of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi>; but he came too late. The concern was worn out and gone, and not even Carlyle could keep it from destruction, particularly when he was associated with Thomas Babble-tongue Macaulay, whose articles would swamp a seventy-four.&#x201D; &#x201C;He is an honourable and worthy man, and talks the most unquestionable High Fifeshire. Of our German scholars, he is clearly the first.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>As you perhaps have seen Alick I need not occupy you with details of my Journey, which after Catlinns offered not the smallest adventure. Hendrick<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The horse.</note> was rather lazyish till we got to Dumfries; at the Ha&#x2019;dykes turn, finding he was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> for Scotsbrig, he gave a deep sigh: but when once he knew the ground, no delay was in him; he rushed along thro&#x2019; the beautiful evening, and set me down between ten and eleven, safe, and to find all safe. There had been little rain here; so I was the more impatiently expected. You recollect you had given me up for Influenza when I left you: but no such thing happened; the ride or something else had mended me, and now I am fully better than before. Jane too keeps fully stouter; we fancy that the weather is drying; and so hope to grow no worse. I wish I knew that your Cold and Earache had as well left you.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-407" n="06:407"/>Since my return I have mended and new-stuffed the <hi rend="italic">Clatch</hi>, which really looks very <foreign>gate-going</foreign> [road-worthy]; I have read a little, dreamed a little; and that is literally all that I have done. Fraser I believe <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to have my Manuscript Book; which will therefore require a very little sorting: but on the whole I prefer resting for a while; at least as long as an uneasy conscience will let me. Absolute Idleness is a thing which, were it never so <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, one <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> carry on long here.</p>
<p>The Austins have had Influenza, and were rather ill off with it, we heard; but are better now: one of them brought up Jack&#x2019;s Trunk (which M&#x2019;Knight had) last Saturday.</p>
<p>Of Jack there came nothing yesterday, tho&#x2019; we partly looked for him; neither today as yet, but it is only four o&#x2019;clock, and there is time yet. A Letter for him has been here since Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nancy is about bundling off to M&#x2019;Knight&#x2019;s; so I must have done. There were otherwise no end of my clatter. God bless and keep you all! You, dear Mother, shall hear again of me, I hope, ere long; and see me again ere <hi rend="italic">very</hi> long.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The nature of my present inquiry will contrast but too mournfully with that of the one brief interview we had some fifteen months ago, should that, the whole extent of personal acquaintance I can plead, still dwell in your memory. You must excuse me; and be well assured that impertinent curiosity is far from all my thoughts at present.</p>
<p>It is perhaps known to you what friendship I had with your high-minded and unfortunate Brother; I found in him the best-gifted, most energetic, and yet worst directed of all the young men known to me; and viewed him accordingly from the first with quite peculiar interest; which, I believe, he with his passionate heart as warmly repaid. My prophecy of him constantly was that he had fearful sufferings to encounter, perhaps the fearfullest of all, before clearness <pb id="pg-06-408" n="06:408"/>of mind was possible: but there lay in him such an honesty of will, such a strength and fire, that victory at last, and high results indeed from such victory, was still to be hoped and expected.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1833-06-07">7 June</date> Carlyle had written in his <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;News also alas that poor William Glen is in Glasgow Asylum, insane and in great bodily pain! Alas, alas! This was the best gifted mind I met with in London; but utterly <hi rend="italic">turned in upon itself:</hi> such a result often seemed to me one of his possibilities. Is it to be the final result? <foreign>Ach Gott!</foreign>&#x201D;</note> After leaving London I continued to hear from him or at least of him, and he of me, at short intervals; but, on a kind of principle, I refrained from writing to him often; and only in last <date when="1833-01-00">January</date> addressed a first Letter to him, to declare in words (what I trusted he was well aware of) my unabated interest in him, love for him and hope of him. That Letter still lies in the hand of our mutual Friend<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill.</note> there, who had lost him then, and could hear nothing but that he was gone to Scotland.</p>
<p>Dr Carlyle, my Brother, returning thro&#x2019; London about a month ago, had the strictest charges from me, and the greatest desire on his own part (for I believe he was William&#x2019;s chief associate while near him) to search out the matter: his accounts were vague but ominous; I applied to a Friend of Mrs Chrystal&#x2019;s, now in these parts, and in the interim acquired the fatal certainty of what had happened. My Brother John at his landing here had to be informed that his old companion and most valued friend could not now welcome him back.</p>
<p>Need I say how deeply all of us sympathize in this calamity; mourn over the wreckage of that noble soul; over your bereavement too, now left alone as you are. Nevertheless &#x201C;while there is life there is hope.&#x201D; Our part, and yours too my young Friend, is not to mourn, but to see whether there is aught that any of us or all of us can <hi rend="italic">do</hi>. As the first preliminary, and to satisfy the most natural desire, I must beg a little information from you. It was only yesterday that I ascertained not your address but how a Letter might reach you; I hope you will answer me at your earliest convenience.</p>
<p>John and I have both had the idea of coming off to Glasgow to examine on the spot; it somehow seems to me inconceivable that the sight of my face would not in some measure soothe poor William&#x2019;s agitation; as it was wont to do; that I could not persuade and command him to be well, take him down with me to these solitudes, and soothe him into peace. Alas! Alas! It is first necessary to ascertain whether his Physician admits any one to see him; whether all this is other than the merest castle-in-the-air. Mr Walter Welsh could tell us only that &#x201C;the Doctors were rather despondent,&#x201D; that the &#x201C;bodily <pb id="pg-06-409" n="06:409"/>sufferings were very great.&#x201D; Will you, my dear Sir, instruct me, in all respects, how it stands; what the bodily sufferings are; whether the mood of mind is of a gloomy, silent, or of a high and violent sort; whether the Patient is allowed to read Letters, to see friends; could with any hope be taken to the country: all that an anxious solicitude could wish to understand about him, which as yet understands only the sad fact in general.</p>
<p>John at least will come to Glasgow, I think, if it seem feasible on your report: his medical skill I reckon very considerable; perhaps too your Brother might meet him with more freedom.</p>
<p>I shall beg an early answer from you; adding only that in these Moors we have for most part but one post weekly; the Wednesday at Dumfries, which corresponds to your Glasgow Tuesday. <hi rend="italic">Next</hi> week indeed there may be an exception.</p>

<salute>My dear Eliza,&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I well remember the fine evening last year when I received your letter. I was riding alone across our solitary moor when I met my boy returning from the post-office, and took it from him and opened it and read it on horseback, too anxious for news about you to keep it for a more convenient place. Had anyone predicted to me <hi rend="italic">then</hi> that the good, kind, trustful letter was to lie unanswered for a whole year, I should have treated such prediction as an injurious calumny which there was not the remotest chance of my justifying! Alas! and it is actually so! For a whole year I have left my dear little friend in Ampton Street to form what theory she pleased concerning the state of my mind towards her; and finally, I suppose, to set me down for heartless and fickle, and dismiss my remembrance with a sigh; for her gentle, affectionate nature is incapable, I believe, of more indignant reproach. And yet, Eliza (it was), neither the one thing nor the other. I am capable of as strong attachment as yourself (which is saying much), and if I do not abandon myself to my attachment <pb id="pg-06-410" n="06:410"/>as you do, it is only because I am older, have had my dreams oftener brought into collision with the realities of life, and learnt from the heart-rending jarring of such collision that &#x2018;all is not gold that glitters,&#x2019; and that one&#x2019;s only safe dependence is in oneself&#x2014;I mean in the good that is in one. As little am I fickle, which I must beg you to believe on trust; since my past life, which would bear me out in the boast, is all unknown to you. What is it, then, you will ask, that makes me fail in so simple a duty of friendship as the writing of a letter? It is sometimes sheer indolence, sometimes sickness, sometimes procrastination. My first impulse, after reading your letter, was to sit down and answer it by the very next post. Then I thought I would wait the Lord Advocate&#x2019;s return, that he may frank it. Then troubles thickened round me: my mother&#x2019;s illness, my grandfather&#x2019;s death, gave me much fatigue of body and mind. That, again, increased to cruel height my own persevering ailments. About the new year we removed to Edinburgh, where we stayed till the beginning of <date when="1833-05-00">May</date>. It was a fully more unhealthy winter for me than the previous one in London. I wrote to no one; had enough to do in striving with the tempter ever present with me in the shape of headaches, heartache, and all kinds of aches, that I might not break out into fiery indignation over my own destiny and all the earth&#x2019;s.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane wrote very few letters during the six years at Craigenputtoch. We have here her fullest explanation for the fact.</note> Since my home coming I have improved to a wonder, and the days have passed, I scarce know how, in the pleasant hopelessness that long-continued pain sometimes leaves behind.</p>
<p>Nay, I must not wrong myself. I have not been quite idle. I have made a gown which would delight Mrs. Page,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a neighbor of the Miles family on Ampton Street, London.</note> it looks so neat and clean; and a bonnet, and loaves of bread innumerable. At present I am reading Italian most of the day with my medical brother-in-law, who is home at present from Rome. It was my husband who, for all his frightening you with some books, raised me from Ariosto today, with the chiding words that it would be altogether shameful if I let his book parcel go without that letter for Miss Miles, which I had talked of writing these six months back.</p>
<p>&#x2026; How is your health? I hope you do not go often to Dr. Fisher&#x2019;s, or at all. The more I see of doctors the more I hold by my old heresy that they are all &#x2018;physicians of no value.&#x2019; My brother-in-law is a paragon of the class, but he is so by&#x2014;in as much as possible&#x2014;undoctoring himself. He told me yesterday, &#x2018;Could I give you some <pb id="pg-06-411" n="06:411"/>agreeable occupation to fill your whole mind, it would do more for you than all the medicines in existence.&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John made a similar remark to Jane during her dreadful illness of <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>, just two years before her death. On <date when="1864-07-23">23 July</date> of that year she wrote to her friend Mrs. Russell of Thornhill, wife of the doctor who had helped her most: &#x201C;Fancy his [John Carlyle&#x2019;s] telling me in my agony yesterday that if I had ever done anything in my life this would not have been: that no poor woman with work to mind had ever had such an ailment as this since the world began.&#x201D; John also criticized her for spending time reading novels. Just four days before her death, after she had read in a letter from Carlyle written from Scotland of a poor woman committing suicide, she commented: &#x201C;What a deal of misery it must take to drive a working woman to make way with her life! What does Dr. Carlyle make of such a case? No Idleness, no Luxury, nor novel reading to make it all plain.&#x201D; Perhaps her most telling remarks about John are those made in a letter to her cousin Jeannie Welsh, <date when="1843-11-12">12 Nov. 1843</date>: &#x201C;He comes here very seldom&#x2014;and never stays long&#x2014;flaps about in the old fashion among indifferent people&#x2014;seems to me a very absurd figure in God&#x2019;s working world&#x2014;but so long as he keeps his absurdity so well out of our road we have no business to interfere with him. If he does not choose to practise his profession or do any but study his own bachelor comforts and <hi rend="italic">eat the dinners which Carlyle declines</hi>&#x2014;for that seems to be the principle on which he is invited out&#x2014;&#x2018;since we cannot get Carlyle we may always have his <hi rend="italic">brother</hi>,&#x2019; one may <hi rend="italic">regret</hi> that a man of some talent&#x2014;and certainly without any <hi rend="italic">vice</hi> should so waste himself&#x2014;but he is not a child that he should be lectured for it&#x2014;so enough of him.&#x201D; See Huxley, <hi rend="italic">JWCLF</hi>, p. 162; and the detailed discussion of the relationship in Mabel Davidson, &#x201C;The Record of a Broken Friendship,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">South Atlantic Quarterly</hi>, XXIV (<date when="1925-07-00">July 1925</date>), 278&#x2013;92.</note></p>
<p>I wish I had you here to drink new milk and ride my horse.</p>
<p>We are at home now for the summer and autumn, most likely for the winter also. We think of France next summer, and moving in the interim were scarce worth while. Surely your father might find someone travelling to Edinburgh by sea, who would take charge of you. It is the easiest and cheapest conveyance possible.</p>
<p>Write to me all that you are thinking and wishing, and never doubt my kind feelings towards you.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>The worst news in your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1833-07-05">5 July</date>.</note> is that of the problematic state your visit still seems to be in; you indeed are better than your former word; but my Brother (who expresses himself much taken with you) <pb id="pg-06-412" n="06:412"/>had led us to suppose that the matter was as good as fixed.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written: &#x201C;Concerning my journey to Craigenputtoch all I can at present say is that if I go not thither I shall go nowhere else. However it will not, at all events be in <date when="1833-08-00">August</date>, for in that month my father will be absent, and it is inconvenient for both of us to be away from the India House at the same time. It cannot be till he return.&#x2014; I had the pleasure of an hour&#x2019;s conversation with D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle on his passing through London, and was glad to learn that he is to be an inmate of Craigenputtoch all this summer and autumn.&#x201D;</note> Of you certainly one can ask nothing more; we shall pray only that circumstances may prove favourable, or that your resolution may be <hi rend="italic">great</hi> to vanquish them. Come, I say, and let us get fairly <hi rend="italic">acquainted</hi> with you; we shall make more progress face to face amid these solitudes than by the present hampered method in three years. You are worth getting acquainted with, I think; and as for me you know that at bottom I am a very inoffensive sort of fellow, with whom if you gain little, you have not to fear losing much. &#x201C;Under false pretences&#x201D; at least, I imagine neither of us will work.</p>
<p>Without appraising, still more without <hi rend="italic">de</hi>preciating your theory about the uses of Logic and your own peculiar vocation that way,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had referred to Carlyle as a Poet and Artist, one capable of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">suggesting</hi> deep and pregnant thoughts which might never have occurred to me&#x201D; and of conceiving intuitive truths which &#x201C;need neither explanation nor proof, but if not known before, are assented to as soon as stated.&#x201D; He continues: &#x201C;I think the <hi rend="italic">vates</hi> himself has often been misunderstood and successfully cried down for want of a Logician in Ordinary, to supply a logical commentary on his intuitive truths. &#x2026; I am not in the least a poet, in any sense; but I can do homage to poetry. I can to a very considerable extent feel it and understand it, and can make others who are my inferiors understand it in proportion to the measure of their capacity. I believe that such a person is more wanted than even the poet himself; that there are more persons living who approximate to the latter character than to the former. I do not think myself at all fit for the one; I do for the other; your walk I conceive to be the higher. Now one thing not useless to do would be to exemplify this difference by enlarging in my logical fashion upon the difference itself: to make those who are not poets, understand that poetry is higher than logic, and that the union of the two is Philosophy.&#x201D;</note> I can heartily rejoice to see you go forward, as I do, with more and more assurance and emphasis in setting forth by the fittest manner whatsoever conviction is in you. A man&#x2019;s theory is valuable simply as it facilitates his practice; neither is there any other way of correcting it where wrong but by practice alone; for indeed till we have <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> and <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, we can never know what power there lies in us to do: our Actions are the kind of mirror in which we first see ourselves. Add to this that seldom indeed are we without wish sufficient to attempt whatsoever we <hi rend="italic">could</hi> perform; that such wish is properly the dim instinct (often so falsely interpreted) of our ability,&#x2014;I see you err, if at all, on the safe <hi rend="italic">defective</hi> side, and so bid you confidently hold on while it will endure with you.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-413" n="06:413"/>There was the strangest old Schoolman (in a new Body only forty years old) at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last winter, with whom I had long conferences once or twice about his Logic, such as, in a higher strain, I could willingly renew with you; but not here;&#x2014;nor perhaps anywhere were it of moment. My similitude was always: Who is he with a pair of <hi rend="italic">stout legs</hi> that cannot <hi rend="italic">walk</hi>, whether he anatomically know the mechanism of the muscles or not? The grand difficulty, I think, with us all is to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> somewhat, to <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> somewhat; a quite mystic operation, to which Logic helps little; to which, proclaim what laws of vision you will, nothing but an <hi rend="italic">eye</hi> will be of service. Neither, as I apprehend, can a <hi rend="italic">believing</hi> man by one means or other readily fail to utter intelligibly his belief, and so <hi rend="italic">infect</hi> others with it (for at bottom it figures itself to me as a kind of divine infection, to which Logic&#x2014;properly the art of <hi rend="italic">Words</hi>&#x2014;is at best a <hi rend="italic">Conductor</hi>); at all events he can translate it into Conduct, and that is a thing which he that runs will read.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Habakkuk 2:2. Mill replied on <date when="1833-08-02">2 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Do not mistake what I meant when I talked of <hi rend="italic">logic</hi>; I did not mean it in the sense in which your answers to Sir William Hamilton (who I suppose is the &#x2018;schoolman&#x2019; you allude to) would apply to it. Of logic, as the theory of the processes of intellect I think not wholly as you, yet nearly: he who has legs can walk without knowledge of anatomy: yet you will allow that such knowledge may be made substantially available for the cure of <hi rend="italic">lameness</hi>. By logic however I meant the antithesis of Poetry or Art: in which distinction I am learning to perceive a twofold contrast: the <hi rend="italic">literal</hi> as opposed to the <hi rend="italic">symbolical</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">reasoning</hi> as opposed to <hi rend="italic">intuition</hi>. Not the <hi rend="italic">theory</hi> of reasoning but the <hi rend="italic">practice</hi>. In reasoning I include all processes of thought which are <hi rend="italic">processes</hi> at all, that is, which proceed by a series of steps or links. What I would say is that my vocation is, I think, chiefly for this last: a more extended &#x26; higher one than for any branch of mere &#x2018;Philosophy of Mind&#x2019; though far inferior to that of the artist.&#x201D; Mill later attacked Sir William Hamilton in <hi rend="italic">An Examination of Sir William Hamilton&#x2019;s Philosophy</hi> (London, <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>).</note> Most of this, you see, straggles hither and thither, and falls harmless over <hi rend="italic">your</hi> head: thus I fulfil my first intention, of both letting you alone, and indicating where I myself am.</p>
<p>As to that of producing an effect and so forth, let me not startle if I say that I could never get any good of such calculations, or almost any. Who <hi rend="italic">can</hi> calculate his effect? You remember I used to speak of William Burns, the Poet&#x2019;s Father;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A man of thoughtful, intense, earnest character, as the best of our peasants are. &#x2026; Such a father is seldom found in any rank of society.&#x201D; &#x201C;Burns,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVI, 293.</note> and paradoxically yet not without truth declare him, the poorest of day-drudges, yet a brave a true man, to have been the most important (<hi rend="italic">effectuallest</hi>) British person living in his time. Let us consider this, what degree of truth there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> in it; and pause amazed over the continual impenetrable mysteriousness of Nature, the Transcendency there is in all her ways! <pb id="pg-06-414" n="06:414"/>Every Act, every Word, I say often, is a <hi rend="italic">seed-grain</hi> cast into all Time,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301219-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-12-19">19 Dec. 1830</date></ref>.</note> into all Space, to work there, perhaps to grow there&#x2014;forever. This is no figure of speech; it is a scientific fact without hyperbole in it. What light then have I about the effects produced by me; what light of estimate <hi rend="italic">can</hi> I have? The thing that is <hi rend="italic">given</hi> me to do, or to speak, that my inward Daemon as the old times called it, commands of me, that I cannot forbear doing or speaking, that thing let me do and speak. Be the issues of it, or no-issues of it, left to Higher Powers, <hi rend="italic">whose</hi> eye commands Immensity and Eternity, and can judge such matters. For me, as good Luther said, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Hier steh&#x2019; ich, ich kann n<supplied>[icht]</supplied> anders; Gott hilf mir! Amen!</hi></foreign> [&#x201C;Here stand I; I can do no other; God assist me! Amen!&#x201D;]<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the Diet of Worms, &#x201C;the greatest moment in the Modern History of Men&#x201D; (&#x201C;The Hero as Priest,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, V, 134&#x2013;35).</note>&#x2014;&#x2014; To a less candid man, all this <supplied>[would of]</supplied> necessity require modifications enough; but you, in your clear just way, will <supplied>[not]</supplied> accuse me of running out blindfold, knocking down passengers, and breaking my own head against posts or &#x201C;Paddington Omnib<hi rend="italic">ii</hi>&#x201D;;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Part of the first public transport system in London.</note> and will supply all that is wanted. Fundamentally it is an image of my Creed in that matter.</p>
<p>Shame on me for so much beating of the wind, when I meant to walk the firm Earth, and be exclusively autobiographical! One of my reasons for wishing you here, tho&#x2019; among the smallest, is a sort of wish to question you about Paris, in its practical, economical and all other aspects: we have a kind of purpose to see it, to settle in it for a while (say next year), and see Books and Men there. France is the great scene of Practice; man is or has been actually thrown bare there; has burst his withe-manacles in some measure; and demonically or angelically works and demeans himself like a very Sampson. All that to a nearly exclusive lover of Realities, were well worth seeing, worth laying to heart. John returns to Italy in little more than a month; a new engagement for two years. Till after his expected return, at least <hi rend="italic">not</hi> at present, I form no settled resolution: this place, with a little company, so very pleasant, does ill, very ill for me, without it; I must struggle to exchange it&#x2014;yet for a better. Meanwhile spiritually too I told you I was at a kind of pause, or crisis; by God&#x2019;s blessing too I have no instant need to write aught in that humour; so I sit pretty quietly till the chaos lay itself, and the new <hi rend="italic">road</hi> (for road there is for one in <hi rend="italic">every</hi> case) grow plainer a little.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi> under the as whimsical title of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>, is to come out piecemeal in <pb id="pg-06-415" n="06:415"/><hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>: I am heartily glad to get my hands washed of the thing; which I now look upon not without a tincture of abhorrence: nevertheless what is written may stand written; I did it as I could.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There seems no hope now of our good Thornton; so, these two Letters, memorials of what might have been and was so near being, must now go the road they came. We had still an expectation; for I <pb id="pg-06-416" n="06:416"/>wrote off, to the care of Inglis, the instant I had Thornton&#x2019;s Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated at Edinburgh, <date when="1833-07-01">1 July</date>. After spending just two nights with Henry Inglis, who treated him with utmost kindness, Thornton Hunt was completely overcome by illness and homesickness. He sent his apologies to the Carlyles and determined to return to London as soon as possible. Hunt replied to Carlyle on <date when="1833-07-29">29 July</date> (Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH</hi>, XLV, 458&#x2013;59): &#x201C;I was astonished one day, on returning home, to find him [Thornton] sitting, not at Craigenputtoch, but in one of the drawing-room chairs, impudently smiling in my face, as if nothing had happened. I was alarmed at first, but not long; &#x26; though he has been very ill since, he has not been as ill as at Edinburgh, &#x26; upon the whole is better than when he left us. We all regret, &#x26; he not the least of us, that his journey was unfinished; especially as in you he had found another friend who could have understood him in his strength as well as weakness, &#x26; encourage &#x26; sustain him, &#x26; do all, &#x26; perhaps more, than any other friend. Yet I must tell you, that these trials are not unknown to his father; sometimes I fear <supplied>[that he appears]</supplied> to inherit a tendency to them from me, as I did from one of my own parents&#x2014;another of whom gave me perhaps more animal spirits to vary them than belong to him. &#x2026; Thornton writes to you across this letter.&#x201D;</note> who however I conclude was already gone. We are really vexed all of us; we think how happy your son could have been and we with him in these fine <date when="1833-07-00">July</date> days; my Brother here too to have doctored him, and nothing but the shine of wholesome skies, and the sound of green woods all round us. Thornton&#x2019;s Letter, so ingenuous so true and gentle looking, had not a little increased our interest. But what can we do? Pray only that the good youth may have got home to his own again, and feel his great misery (to me well known) assuaged a little. After such a misventure it looks foolish to say more about visits: I will only repeat however that I took you at your word in that kind imagination of your also having a house in Nithsdale; be it well understood then that <hi rend="italic">so</hi> stands it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt had written to Carlyle on <date when="1833-03-07">7 March</date> (Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH</hi>, XLV, 450): &#x201C;Would to heaven that I could come myself! &#x2026; I shall look upon it as a good thing which I have in a <hi rend="italic">sort</hi> of <hi rend="italic">posse</hi>,&#x2014;as a pleasure which I can fly to, if I can fly anywhere,&#x2014;a friend&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">locale</hi> at my service,&#x2014;an own other-man&#x2019;s possession &#x26; country-house, which is mine when I can go to it. This is much, believe me; &#x26; reminds me of one of the greatest pleasures I had in the world, which was, that wherever Shelley had a roof over his head, there I had a bit of it to put over mine, in case I chose to seek it,&#x2014;whether he was abroad or at home, in England or Italy, or had gone to China. He once thought of taking a voyage to India; &#x26; I immediately felt as if I had a house in Calicut, or the Himalaya mountains.&#x201D;</note> For the rest give our love and sympathy to Thornton, our prophecy that he will rise to be a Man and Painter, in spite of all hindrances; there looks thro&#x2019; him that fair openness of soul which, besides its intrinsic price and pricelessness, I have ever found the surest presage of all other gifts.</p>
<p>And now, my dear Sir, let us beg a Letter from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, to knit up these ravelments; so much lies uncertain to us. That you labour, and continue thro&#x2019; all weathers to labour, with such undying cheerfulness <pb id="pg-06-417" n="06:417"/>and hope, we rejoice to believe: but pray give assurance of it; let us sympathize with you if it is not so. I say <hi rend="italic">we</hi> and <hi rend="italic">us</hi> in all this matter; for my Wife and I are at one in it.</p>
<p>What you mention about the new Poetical subject might awaken one&#x2019;s curiosity; but perhaps you are of Goethe&#x2019;s mind (which I think a very good one) that if you <hi rend="italic">blab</hi> in seeking hidden treasure, the spirits will rise, and whisk it (and oneself too) to the Devil. I can heartily give you joy of the mood you hint at; it is one I have fancied often enough, but never was at any time near to. Go on and prosper, were the times never so prosaic! There is an ear and a heart in man; if not in this man or in that man, yet in some man: let us forever have Faith in man.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a postscript to his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1833-05-28">28 May</date> (Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH</hi>, XLV, 454), Hunt had said: &#x201C;I have at length discovered, to my irrepressible &#x26; daily delight, in spite of innumerable cares &#x26; the other tasks that took me away from it, a subject that suits all the poetical feelings that I ever had in me, &#x26; which, I feel certain will put them in the best &#x26; most refined <supplied>[?]</supplied> light they ever appeared in, or are capable of manifesting. It is the first time I ever felt <hi rend="italic">my nature versified</hi>,&#x2014;without some confusion of art &#x26; misgiving; &#x26; the poem will either be fifty-fold the best thing I ever did, or a huge mistake. For my part, I am impudent enough to be full of confidence.&#x201D; In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1833-07-29">29 July</date> (Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH</hi>, XLV, 460) he again wrote about this poem: &#x201C;My subject, at all events (which I will disclose to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, &#x26; of course to your other you, in spite of what Goethe says &#x26; says truly) is one, for the first time, that suits my whole nature, its gravity, &#x26; its levity; its experiences, &#x26; its wishes; &#x26; if I have any poetry in me at all, there it will be found. The poem is entitled A Day with the Reader, &#x26; its object is to shew <hi rend="italic">how the common-places of life may be enriched</hi> by feeling &#x26; fancy, not omitting his breakfast, with his China teacups, his dinner, his bed, his room with the most trivial things around him, his walks on the streets, &#x26; his restings in the country.&#x201D;</note> We are this morning reading your <hi rend="italic">Rimini</hi>;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Story of Rimini</hi> (London, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>).</note> with praise enough on all hands; with a <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> feeling on my part if not of the Art yet of the Artist: sunny Italy with her Children of the Sun, all is so freely mirrorred [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] there.</p>
<p>As for myself I am idle, all but a little reading; chiefly of French Revolution <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires</hi>, and such other <hi rend="italic">Realities</hi> as I can come at. My Brother has all manner of things to say about Rome and Naples, even the poor old purple or rather Scarlet old woman of a Holy Father is worth looking at. To me Italy face to face were perhaps almost wearisome at present. Spiritually I feel myself in a kind of crisis; the best I can do is to stand still a little; my road will disclose itself again (let me hope, to still higher countries, pleasanter or not) by and by. I have found it generally so with me; from time to time I have a kind of sick moulting-season; but after that, new feather<supplied>[s;]</supplied> without great previous pain I never made any advancement.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-418" n="06:418"/>Many thanks for your attentive perusal of my poor <hi rend="italic">Diderot</hi>. A few such readers, and careful writing were worth while; that one such thinks me worth reading is encouragement. Pity that I were not with you to hear your whole <foreign><hi rend="italic">Miserere</hi></foreign> over the Marriage-state; which I wholly agree with you is at present miserable enough.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The subject of marriage is discussed at some length in Hunt&#x2019;s letter to Carlyle of <date when="1833-05-28">28 May</date> (Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH</hi>, XLV, 453). He spoke of it as &#x201C;an experiment which I should hardly think can be said to have succeeded in the world, even in this chaste &#x26; hypocritical &#x26; Mamma-sacrificing country of England, where, if I like, as I do everywhere, the fine capable human being, I hate as hard as I can the <foreign><hi rend="italic">nation boutiqui&#xE8;re</hi></foreign> [nation of shopkeepers], with their love of pence &#x26; lords, &#x26; their sacrifice, in the metropolis, of a sixth part of the poor female sex for the convenience of prudential young gentlemen &#x26; the preservation of chastity in the five remaining classes of shrews &#x26; scolds, &#x26; women good &#x26; bad, &#x26; wives happy, unhappy, &#x26; crim-con-ical<supplied>[?]</supplied>. The love of two loving people I love &#x26; revere, &#x26; wish and believe they remain together to all eternity, whether they think as I do on the subject of marriage or not; but my notions, I own, are more Golden-Aged on this point than those of the Kirk &#x26; the cutty-stool,&#x2014;the bishops &#x26; Miss Hannah Moore, whom I am Christian enough to wish had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been an old maid, for then she would have been more virtuous &#x26; tolerant.&#x201D; The discussion about marriage arose out of Carlyle&#x2019;s forthright comments in &#x201C;Diderot.&#x201D;</note> Nevertheless I would stand by my argument that the Covenant of Marriage m<supplied>[ust]</supplied> be perennial; nay that in a better state of society there will be other pere<supplied>[nnial]</supplied> Covenants between man and man, and the home-feeling of man in this world <supplied>[of]</supplied> his be all the kindlier for it. For instance, could two Friends, good men both, declare themselves Brothers, and by Law make themselves so! Alas, Friendship were again possible in this Earth; and not as at present only Dining-together. But as for the unfortunate-females and so forth, I declare I can see <hi rend="italic">no</hi> remedy except in improvement of the individual: till people learn again what <hi rend="italic">god</hi>like meaning is in Duty and practice Self-denial which is the beginning of all, what can you do for them by Laws? All machinery of Laws will entangle itself in new confusion before it is well set up; because the <hi rend="italic">hinges</hi> are naught; I mean the four Cardinal virtues are not there. Finally I will most heartily agree with you, nay I often vehemently assert the same myself that at whatever rate we value chastity, it is brutish and delirious to punish only the weaker for want of it. The fault I continue to declare <hi rend="italic">is</hi> (in spite of all genealogy barbarisms) alike for both; and so indeed our worthy old Cutty Stool<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The low seat in Scottish churches where offenders against chastity sat to receive public rebuke during services, a practice given up well before the end of the eighteenth century.</note> (which I reverence much even in its worm-eaten state) has always most honestly regarded it. Praise to the Cutty Stool, for its day, then! I pray only to Heaven that we had a new one&#x2014;of better <pb id="pg-06-419" n="06:419"/>structure if you will;&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">a new one</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">principle</hi> that made the old one, this is to me the grand want of wants. Thus you see we could discourse most eloquent musical discords for a week, or year.</p>
<p>What of the Advocate now? It is months since we heard a syllable of him, except by the Newspapers. I fear he is vexed and worried; the people and their Editors are grunting at him not a little here and there: I wish he were well out of that scandalous Cockpit, and back again to Craigcrook.&#x2014; Do not wait for Franks when none are convenient. Nothing is better worth its price (even taxed price) than a Letter of Yours. <closer><salute>And so all Good with you and yours! My Wife joins with me in that prayer.&#x2014; Ever affectionately</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I salute you with undiminished regard; and sincerely thank you for your letter. It is the only &#x2018;voice from <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi>&#x2019; that has reached us since we left; save a hysterical giggle from John Gordon about his marriage<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter has not been found.</note>&#x2014; If we were not in closer connexion with London, whence we have news every week; we should remain in total ignorance &#x201C;how they ack i the various places,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321010-JWC-EA-01">JWC to <sic>ES</sic><corr>EA</corr>, <date when="1832-10-10">10 Oct. 1832</date></ref>.</note> and might come in time to be as great curiosities of innocence as the King and Queen of the Sandwich Islands&#x2014;who poor things stuffed themselves to death, if you remember&#x2014;a more touching instance of overeating is nowhere on record.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1824-07-00">July 1824</date> the king and queen of the Sandwich Islands died in Osborne&#x2019;s Hotel, London, apparently of measles. Nothing has been found in contemporary reports to indicate over-eating. Theodore Hook made the impromptu couplet for the occasion: &#x201C;&#x2018;Waiter, two Sandwiches,&#x2019; cried Death, / And their wild majesties resigned their breath.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Bon-Mots of Samuel Foote and Theodore Hook</hi>, ed.

<p>From overeating the association is natural to digesting&#x2014;so I shall take the present p<supplied>[a]</supplied>ragraph to inform you, that of late I have been digesting not ill. If you were at all instrumental in giving me Influenza; you have the satisfaction to think you gave me a good thing&#x2014;for I <pb id="pg-06-420" n="06:420"/>am certainly indebted to it for a considerable improvement in my hea<supplied>[l]</supplied>th, which has been better ever since, than at any time for two years previous. It has even seemed as if my beauty would emerge from its premature eclipse&#x2014;at least it has occasional<supplied>[l]</supplied>y struck me that my glass reflected something more than &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">remains</hi> of a fine woman&#x2014;&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321010-JWC-EA-01">JWC to <sic>ES</sic><corr>EA</corr>, <date when="1832-10-10">10 Oct. 1832</date></ref>.</note> the animated presence of an average sort of woman&#x2014; Nothing indeed <hi rend="italic">that</hi> to found conceit upon; but like <hi rend="italic">the penny roll</hi> it may be &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">made to do</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; And better thus perhaps than to be &#x201C;ower foo hadin&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Over full holden&#x201D;: too well off.</note> as the proverb goes&#x2014; For instance Had [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] the Queen of the Sandwich Islands been but restricted to a penny roll!</p>
<p>On the whole this summer has passed away pleasantly&#x2014; when I wake in the morning, and wink my eyes, and ascertain that I have <hi rend="italic">still</hi> no headach<supplied>[e]</supplied>, I spring up in good humour for the day; prepared to take the rest as I find it. The <hi rend="italic">work</hi> I have done would go little way in furnishing out a set of dinning [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] tables (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Davies&#x2019;s were exhibit<supplied>[e]</supplied>d to her acquaintance, for three days, before the Sale of Ladies work, spread over with twenty pounds worth of knick nacks!) but it is enough to keep my hand in, and the Devil out, who &#x201C;is always,&#x201D; they say, &#x201C;at the elbow of an idle man,&#x201D; still more of an idle woman. I am more intent in getting all the good possible from the free access one has here to the open air&#x2014; I am out and in all day long&#x2014;neither walking nor working with any continuance but combining all sorts of excercise [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and all sorts of tasks in the most rapid alternation&#x2014;a well fitting gown, and a rather stylish bonnet have received beginning and finish in this way&#x2014;also one cap, one collar, and one shift. Nor has my hand forgot its cunning, in kneading dough, and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">pressing</hi> the <hi rend="small-caps">snowy</hi> <hi rend="italic">curd</hi>&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced.</note>&#x2014;(no good sign of curd, by the way which is the better the yellower it is)&#x2014; Accordingly there is a cheese lying in state for your Uncle, with which I have had much sorrow. Once, twice, thrice the mice assaulted it&#x2014;and so often left the impression of their &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">beautiful dents</hi>&#x201D; (as Captain Robison at Pitcathly<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Pitcaithly, Dunbarny parish, Perthshire; Robison, not identified.</note> used to say) and Lord Minto was not more beside himself when the rats assaulted the cheek of his last Born,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first Earl of Minto was Gilbert Elliot (<date when="1751-00-00">1751</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>), but he had several ancestors who were law lords. Reference unexplained.</note> than I under these audacious attempts. I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have fired a pistol&#x2014; I did better&#x2014;baited a trap.</p>
<p>Young Hunt is not come nor coming&#x2014; He got the length of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> where he was kindly entertained by Henry Inglis; as we had arranged <pb id="pg-06-421" n="06:421"/>for him. But the fatigue of the journey and the separation&#x2014;his first separation from his own people increased his nervous ailments to such a degree, that he could resolve on nothing but to go back with all dispatch the way he came. We have had my Brother-in-law wit<supplied>[h]</supplied> us for some six weeks&#x2014;but he soon leaves t<supplied>[o]</supplied> return with Lady Clare to Italy, for two years&#x2014;so that our movements will not for the present be determined by <hi rend="italic">his</hi> choice of a settlement. Most probably we shall remain where we are next winter&#x2014;and go somewhere, perhaps abroad, in the spring or summer. We have had no other visitors except my Mother in law for two weeks; and my Mother Walter and Helen for a fly [flying visit]&#x2014; My Mother has mounted an equipage of a rather fanciful sort&#x2014;namely a <foreign>cuddy</foreign> and cart! which travels at the rate of two miles an hour&#x2014; The whole apparatus I confess looks less useful than absurd&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>As I may well say that few Letters could have interested me more than yours and Dr Cumin&#x2019;s did,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neither letter has been found. William Cumin (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), army surgeon who had served in the Peninsular campaign; M.D. at Glasgow University, <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>; surgeon to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>, to the Lock Hospital and to the Royal Lunatic Asylum; Professor of Botany at Anderson&#x2019;s College, Glasgow, <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>; and of Midwifery in the University, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>.</note> it seems very strange I should have <pb id="pg-06-422" n="06:422"/>so loitered with my answer. The truth is I was called from home almost next day, and have been much driven about ever since; till at length tho&#x2019; the matter lay reproachfully on my mind, I had half taken refuge in the sluggard plea that as we should soon <hi rend="italic">see</hi> yourself in Galloway, it was not indispensable that I should write at all. Your second Letter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> which waited me yesterday on my way hither, brings me to better recollection. I beg of you to accept this confession with forgivenness; to believe that my neglect was apparent only. Will you also in no wise neglect to offer Dr Cumin my best thanks for his lucid, friendly, judicious Letter, which brought the whole melancholy case as it were quite before my eyes.</p>
<p>My Brother and I have of course talked many times of our poor Friend&#x2019;s situation: John leaves us tomorrow morning again for Italy, and felt too hurried I believe (by this rather sudden recall) for a journey to Glasgow, where in any case, as he has often said, there seemed nothing to be done, nothing to be amended. He will write you what he thinks, at the end of this sheet.</p>
<p>As for myself, tho&#x2019; Dr Cumin&#x2019;s description gives me the clearest view of poor William&#x2019;s case, I can form no prediction of it that were grounded upon <hi rend="italic">any</hi> basis. The condition is the sadder to me, as it seems simply the continuation and confirmation of much that I saw and strove against in William&#x2019;s character before. He was one of the <hi rend="italic">proudest</hi> men I ever knew. His Pride truly was tempered with a noble affectionateness, and reverence for what was really high; so I still hoped the better element might prevail: but, alas, it has for the present been the worse. Who knows, however, as I always say, but it may be thro&#x2019; this darkest of passages that he was appointed to be led into light; by this deep Humiliation that the devil&#x2019;s-spirit of Pride was finally to be cast out of him! He is still young and strong, still far on this side the turn of life; there is much in the power of Time, and man&#x2019;s existence to the last close of it is <hi rend="italic">founded</hi> upon Hope. We will still hope. One other thing only seems evident to me, that in point of management and medical aid, our good William may be reckoned fortunate; perhaps better where he is than in one of a hundred places elsewhere.</p>
<p>But on the whole, before any new arrangement is made, shall I not see you, as you almost engaged, at Craigenputtoch? We are but some seven or eight miles from your native Parton; not two miles from one road that leads from Glasgow thither. We are to be at home <pb id="pg-06-423" n="06:423"/>very closely henceforth; and shall in all sincerity feel <hi rend="italic">much</hi> satisfied if you will come. We can talk the whole business thro&#x2019; and thro&#x2019; there; and understand it better than by innumerable Letters. Mrs C. also counts upon you.&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>All the pains I had taken were well rewarded on Sunday evening, when your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> came. It has solaced me here, and will give no less solacement to those that love you elsewhere: I will send it off, as you conjecture, to Scotsbrig, tomorrow. We can now know that you are safe so far, and send our wishes after you with new clearness. My Mother said: &#x201C;we&#x2019;ll no be sae ill, if we had the first Letter frae him.&#x201D; On Friday or Saturday (the former, as I calculate) a like comfort must be provided for you in return.</p>
<p>Your Steamboat, that agitated day, had scarcely cleared the Pierhead,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As Carlyle records in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, he &#x201C;went off with&#x201D; John to Bowness, on the English side of the Solway Firth, and &#x201C;saw him set sail&#x201D; on the steam-packet for Liverpool; Carlyle then had to return to Annan by ferry. Soon afterward he wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;John is a good man; with far more talent than even yet he has unfolded fully, though already he begins to show himself as a skilful Physician, likely I imagine to prove useful and also acceptable. He has a boundless affectionateness; this is his great quality, manifesting itself too at times in strange ways, as in humourous frolicking (even with pigs and horses, if there is no other <hi rend="italic">living</hi> thing to frolick with), in the trustfullest abandonment to all kinds of innocently foolish talk and sport, throughout, as a genuine inexhaustible fund of <foreign><hi rend="italic">bonhommie</hi></foreign>,&#x2014;the soul of all manner of useful sympathies and activities, of a character <hi rend="italic">natural</hi>, at once worthy and amiable. How different from me; how much happier and better! We all love him, and have good reason. May the Unseen Powers, that mercifully look on mankind, bring him safe back to us!&#x201D;</note> when I was stripping and bathing; my head and my heart, like your own, all full of painful obstruction and confusion. It was half an hour before we set sail again, and near two o&#x2019;clock before we reached <pb id="pg-06-424" n="06:424"/>the Annan shore. We could see your vessel storming along with you, already far to the West; and not we only, but all your other Friends each from his several hillside had seen it and watched it, and could tell at what hour it had vanished behind St Bees. Our Mother &#x201C;took a good <foreign>greet</foreign>&#x201D; when she saw it start off; but then checked herself, she said, with the question: Could she really wish it had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> gone? At my return to Scotsbrig, all was grown calm again; our good Mother had rallied herself, and summoned up better thoughts: Jamie said to me, He had never seen her so <hi rend="italic">sair beat</hi> with anything. Most of the Scotsbrig hands went off to Catlinns that same afternoon to help Alick next day with his hay; so my Mother and I remained alone, and had leisure for a little quiet communing. She could not help remarking how much more ominous your former departure was, into vague Space as it were, yet how she had borne it; and already Hope, that springs eternal, was glimmering out for her. If it be God&#x2019;s merciful will, we shall yet all live to see your Steamboat come foaming <hi rend="italic">up</hi> the Solway, and bringing you safe back to us. I saw it once so from the Landheads Brae; and should be thankful for the feeling as long as I live.</p>
<p>Next morning betimes Jamie and I were mounted for Catlinns, and breakfasted there with a numerous haymaking party; conjecturing that you might be already in the Mersey;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leading into Liverpool.</note> treating this and all things in the tone of Hope. I soon set forth, and plodded wearisomely thro&#x2019; the Moors to Templand, where I arrived before Dinner, with such a jaded road-worn woe-worn sort of feeling as you can conceive. The Sunday proved too wet for Dunscore, I went to Closeburn and there heard Corson,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Corson. Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310818-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1831-08-18">18 Aug. 1831</date>]</ref>.</note> uttering the wonderfullest jumble of affectations, imitations, wind and froth: not till next evening did we reach home, and find ourselves once more thoroughly <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>. The sorrowfullest blank had occur<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed here; for me I could not but feel so <hi rend="italic">harried</hi>, so bereaved; the half of my world was gone, and nothing of it remained but self-reproaching recollections and other the like shadows or foreshadows which could not profit. This day week I had all the disposition in the world to sit down and write to you, and pour out my heart into yours; but I feared it might derange our previous plan, fancied you might not have arrived, and so forth; and thus happily restrained myself; happily, for it would have been all in the elegaic strain, sad confessions, beggings of forgivenness [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], which I know you would have heartily granted, nay had already granted; thus what could it serve for but to add sorrow to sorrow? On the whole, I have striven <pb id="pg-06-425" n="06:425"/>to banish all unproductive pain as fast as I might; and am thro&#x2019; that first stage of the matter with less suffering than I expected. From Scotsbrig too I heard on Thursday (of date exactly this night week), and learned that all stood well there; our Mother in her usual mood: they had got your Newspapers on the Sunday; on the Catlinns one had deciphered &#x201C;Saturday Noon,&#x201D; and were waiting quietly for more. You must not fail to write to our Mother; she told me she could not make you <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> to write to her often, for you could not be convinced how cheap she reckoned the post-price of your Letters; I told her you were now grown very punctual about promises, and would probably be better than your word.</p>
<p>This, dear Brother, is our history since you left us. Nothing has occurred here, except the arrival, on Friday last, of a Piano-tuner, who for the small charge of 5/6 has rehabilitated the Piano, and brought me again the luxury of sweet sounds. We carried the poor instrument into the Dining-room, to avoid the coming frosts, and there nightly I can have my tunes: it stands where the half-table did against the wall right opposite the window; the sofa is moved into its place, and the half-table into the sofa&#x2019;s, in the Drawing-room. Let me add also (for you love all these things) that Napoleon,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Norton gives a note by Mary Aitken Carlyle which states that this is a small copy in bronze of the Place Vend&#xF4;me statue.</note> as too large for his station, has been moved into this Library of mine, under his kinsman Byron, and your little Italian vase, with Goethe&#x2019;s medals in it and other <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>, now stands in his place. The only other arrival was, on Sunday at dinner-time, that of the American Emerson,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ralph Waldo Emerson (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>), New England transcendentalist philosopher, essayist, and poet. For a detailed and perceptive study of Emerson&#x2019;s relation to Carlyle, see Joseph Slater, <hi rend="italic">The Correspondence of Emerson and Carlyle</hi> (New York and London, <date when="1964-00-00">1964</date>), pp. 3&#x2013;94, and the notes to the letters. See also Emerson&#x2019;s letter to Alexander Ireland, <date when="1833-08-30">30 Aug. 1833</date>, in Conway, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, pp. 220&#x2013;23. On <date when="1833-08-28">28 Aug.</date> Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;A most amiable creature this Emerson, who came up hither in a Dumfries Gig, last Sunday as we were at dinner. Staid till next afternoon, then rolled off again. A singular apparition here, on a to me nigh inconceivable errand. He got into the heartiest conversation, the time passed genially along, and a pleasant sad-shaded remembrance remains of it.&#x201D;</note> Gustave d&#x2019;Eichthal&#x2019;s man;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had met d&#x2019;Eichthal in Rome, had carried a letter of reference from him to J. S. Mill in London; and Mill had in turn given Emerson a short note of reference which he carried to Craigenputtoch.</note> the most amiable creature in the world, who spent an apparently very happy four-and-twenty hours with us, and then went his way to Wordsworth&#x2019;s Lakes, to Liverpool, and home to Massachussets [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] on Sunday next. We regretted that you had not <pb id="pg-06-426" n="06:426"/>seen him, as he that he had not found you in Rome. Of d&#x2019;Eichthal he could tell me nothing, except that they parted a few weeks ago when you left them, the one for Florence and England, the other for Naples: indeed it appeared they had in reality met only once or twice. If you fall in with d&#x2019;Eichthal, it will perhaps be friendly if you rather press yourself on him; I figure him to be somewhat shrouded up within his own sorrow and regret, and understand his family are anxious to have his mind by all means diverted and cheerfully aroused. Tell him that he has much affectionate esteem from me; that if he will come and see us here, we will give him the most cordial welcome. I suppose you will see his friends in Paris at any rate; and be able there to tell me something more definite about him.</p>
<p>This is Tuesday evening: probably you have seen Lady Clare, or are perhaps even now consulting with her. We shall long to hear what arrangements have been made, how you like the aspect of your enterprise. It were more cheerful for us if Miss Morris<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></ref>.</note> too went with you, but this perhaps is no longer a possibility. At all events one likes to think you have seen so pure a friendly creature, and will again see her. If she will accept my hearty good wishes and regards, pray offer them her; say that for her friends&#x2019; sake we love her, and hope one day perhaps to know her better. As for your Business itself, I discern far fewer risks than there were the former time; yet one risk, which you have well to guard against: that of letting the tedium of it get the better of you, that of feeling too painfully that you are above it. Beware especially of this; always remind yourself that you have <hi rend="italic">undertaken</hi> a duty, that you must and will honestly address yourself, in doing and suffering, to discharge it like a man. But indeed, it gives me great comfort to reflect what strength there has grown up in you for this as for all emergencies; how you promise to increase in calm wisdom, in intelligent activity, and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> your part as is required of you. I cannot but see too that your mood of mind is the right one for you: nay, at bottom, as you often urged, were the right one for me also: your earnest counsels for Tolerance will not fail of their effect on me; such are at all times wholesome mementos, and forever true on their own side, and I know not why I should so often have taken them up at your hands under the argumentative aspect. Perhaps it was like a patient wincing under a bitter drug, which yet when over had its salutary tendencies. Continue, however, to hold on steadfastly by the light, by the faith that is in you. Quit not that for assembled worlds; for Devils (in one&#x2019;s own heart) which are still worse to strive with. <pb id="pg-06-427" n="06:427"/>For the rest, cheer up, my good Brother! No sorrowing that you can help; fix rather, as you often advise me, on the coming bright side of things: think and believe that you are under Higher Guidance, which will guide you well; that, thro&#x2019; God&#x2019;s grace, we shall welcome you back again ere long, and not part so far any more, but one way or other set up our little tabernacles somewhere within sight and call of one another. Has not the wide Earth space in it for such a thing? It is one of my most favourite projects. There we can argue and assent, and sputter and coalesce, and quarrel and agree again, with better and better heart, and feel always that help is not far from us. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Frischer Muth in frohem Sinn</hi></foreign> [Fresh courage in a cheerful spirit]! So shall the latter end of these men be better than the beginning.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 2 Peter 2:20. For the German quotation, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320702-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-07-02">2 July 1832</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>As for me and my moorland loneliness never let it settle on your heart. I feel as of old that the only true enemy I have to struggle with is the unreason within myself. If I have given s<supplied>[uch]</supplied> things harbour within me I must with pain cast them out again. Still, then, still Light will arise for my outward path too, were my inward light once clear again; and the world with all its tribulations lie under my feet. &#x201C;Be of good cheer; I have <hi rend="italic">overcome</hi> the world&#x201D;:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John 16:33.</note> so said the wisest man, when what was his overcoming? Poverty, despight [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], forsakenness, and the near prospect of an accursed Cross! &#x201C;Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world!&#x201D; these words on the streets of Edinburgh last winter almost brought tears into my eyes. But on the whole quarrel not with my deliberate feeling that this Wilderness is no wholesome abode for me, that it is my <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> to strive with all industry, energy and cheerful determination to change it for one less solitary. Consider also that I am far past the years for headlong changes; and will not rush out to the warfare without a plan and munitions of war. Nay for a time my best duty must be composure; the settling of innumerable things that are at sixes and sevens within myself. I am writing nothing yet, but am not altogether idle: depend upon it, I shall pass the winter here far more happily than you expect. So fear not for me, my dear Brother; continue to hope of me; to pray that the work given me to do may be done.</p>
<p>What you say of Irving and Badams is deeply interesting. See Badams again, and assure him with all emphasis of my unalterable interest. Tell him that while I have a home in this Earth the half of it must be his; that if he will come hither, he shall have a Laboratory-room, free air, friends&#x2019; voices and looks, and none to make him afraid, and will <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> himself and come to life again under my roof, as I have <pb id="pg-06-428" n="06:428"/>done under his. Urge all this on him, if you think such a journey feasible: as matters go, I really fear for his <hi rend="italic">life</hi>. It is miserable that there should be no help! The man <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be healed again; there is stuff in him to make twenty men. As for Irving his case seems but a shade less tragical: if Death is threatening the one, Insanity is hovering at small distance from the other. God avert it! but what can man do? A total change of place and companionship; twelve months of some foreign Country, where he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not preach for want of a language: this has long seemed the only appliance; but this till the Newman-Street bubble have burst he will not have recourse to. Say that I feel the friendliest sympathy in his fortunes, and cannot cease to feel with a friend&#x2019;s heart towards him while I have a heart.</p>
<p>This day week then I suppose we must fancy you on the way to Dover. You will write to some of us, to our Mother or to me before then; but you will be over the Channel before I can hear. So my next Letter may probabliest be from Paris. Write whenever my good genius moves you, when there is a moment&#x2019;s leisure, or your heart has anything it longs to utter. Jane continues no worse, slowly improving I rather think; she sends you her sisterly good wishes, and says you promised to write to <hi rend="italic">her</hi>. I myself have taken two more of your Pills, and intend to get me a dozen of them; one in the week must suffice: I adhere to the breadless tea, but am in danger of enlarging the <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi>. Turn now to the margins; which I will not leave empty, tho&#x2019; there is little more to be said<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>By all means make Fraser <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> you the &#xa3;10: too much is better than too little; and it is safer in your hands than in his; neither is there any the smallest difficulty in settling about it here, the instant one needs it, or before that.&#x2014; I wish I could write again before you leave Britain; but it will not do. Appoint me your <foreign><hi rend="italic">Poste restante</hi></foreign>, and I will do my best to meet you. If you write to my Mother, her Letter could be <hi rend="italic">here</hi> on the Wednesday after she gets it: this you have perhaps considered; but it will be too late before you get <hi rend="italic">this</hi>. Order, yourself; I will conform.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Some other little notices remain: Send me Badams&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">Address</hi>. Tell Mill to <hi rend="italic">come</hi> if he can, that is, should you see him again. Give my kind respects to W. Hamilton; also to his Wife&#x2014;who should have been first mentioned. Probably you did not see Allan Cunningham; or Holcroft?&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>By dint of great industry I realized this inclosed Letter from our good Doctor on Sabbath afternoon; of course I must hurry it on to you by Nancy tomorrow. You see all has hitherto gone well with poor Jack, and he will probably be under way again in about a week hence. I think it likely he may write you before; at least I rather encouraged him to do it. I have just finished an immense Letter to him, which I trust will find him safe on Friday: there was as little of grief or lamenting as I could; in a little while we shall be in our old train again, and must just be as patient as we were. I told him I expected he would write to you not seldomer than he promised but <hi rend="italic">oftener</hi>. So what can we do, dear Mother, but commit what is precious to us to the merciful Higher Hand, and wait with thankfulness, with hope and faith, for what He pleases to appoint.</p>
<p>I told Jack that you were quite composed again; that we had all watched his Ship from our several hill-sides, and sent our blessings with him; that we should trust and pray that we might all see him coming up the Solway again, safe home once more to us. It is in <pb id="pg-06-430" n="06:430"/>God&#x2019;s hands, my dear Mother: we indeed know not what a day may bring forth; but could it be in <hi rend="italic">better</hi> hands?</p>
<p>As for ourselves we got home on Monday; I was not perhaps so sad as I might have feared. Since then all has gone well: I am not writing yet, and know not well when I shall; yet am I not <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, sometimes even <hi rend="italic">busy</hi>, and so look forward to the winter with a degree of cheerfulness, which will increase with me the more I <hi rend="italic">deserve</hi> to be cheerful.</p>
<p>Your parcel with Jane&#x2019;s welcome Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> in it was got to hand (thro&#x2019; Nethertown) on Thursday: all safe and welcome,&#x2014;except indeed a little grease-spot on Ben Nelson&#x2019;s Book (from the wrappage of it, I think) which however is of smallest confidence [<hi rend="italic">sic:</hi> consequence]. Since then three little happinesses have befallen us. First a Piano-tuner, procured for 5 shillings and 6 pence, has been here, entirely reforming the Piano, so that I can hear a little music now, which does me no little good. Secondly, the Major Irving of Gribton who used at this season of the year to live and shoot at Craigenvey, came in one day to us, and after some clatter offered us a rent of &#xa3; 5 for the right to shoot here, and even tabled the cash that moment and would not pocket it again. Money easilier won never sat in my pocket; money for delivering us from a great nuisance; for now I will tell every Gunner applicant: I cannot, Sir; it is let. Our third happiness was the arrival of a certain young unknown Friend named Emerson from Boston in the United States, who turned aside so far from his British French and Italian travels, to see me here! He had an introduction from Mill and a Frenchman (Baron d&#x2019;Eichthal&#x2019;s Nephew) whom John knew in Rome. Of course we could do no other than welcome him; the rather as he seemed to be one of the most loveable creatures in himself we had ever looked on. He staid till next day with us, and talked and heard talk to his heart&#x2019;s content, and left us all really sad to part with him. Jane says, it is the first journey ever since Noah&#x2019;s Deluge undertaken to Craigenputtoch for such a purpose. In any case, we <hi rend="italic">had</hi> a cheerful day from it, and ought to be thankful.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi>, pp. 11&#x2013;15, 97&#x2013;101, for Emerson&#x2019;s comments on the visit; also Emerson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">English Traits</hi> (<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>).</note></p>
<p>I have no other news to tell you; nothing is astir here, but a little hay-gathering rather languidly. We had a kind of Lammas Flood, but the windiest and <hi rend="italic">driest</hi> I remember. There is a great Drought in the South, they say: here too no rain we have had has gone beyond skin-deep.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-06-431" n="06:431"/>I had a thought of sending the two Portraits down to Jamie Aitken to be framed with the rest; but must first see whether Nancy can <hi rend="italic">take</hi> them quite safely&#x2014;for she has <hi rend="italic">seventeen</hi> cheeses, besides yellow butter enough. If she cannot I will take charge of them in due season myself.</p>
<p>It is said Stroquhan has found a Purchaser; yet also that we are not to have a new Neighbour, but only the Edinburgh people a new Lawsuit. The case it seems is this: John Anderson hearing that the property is sold suddenly steps forward and says: This property was never my Brother&#x2019;s, for my Father who survived him, was of unsound mind when he gave it up; and so now it is by fair inheritance <hi rend="italic">mine;</hi> and I will pay my Father&#x2019;s debts from it, but of my Brother&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a shilling! A most monstrous piece of conduct, as <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi> as may be to have a colour of lawfulness. Such at least is the common clatter of the country; it may have some basis more or less, it may have none.</p>
<p>Now my good Crow<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s black-haired sister, Jean.</note> must write again soon, and tell me how the Harvest progresses and the Harvesters, at Scotsbrig and at Catlinns. I am glad too that Mrs Clow<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s mother-in-law.</note> <hi rend="italic">staid;</hi> yet surely she should make the miserable <foreign>Laird</foreign> pay down what <hi rend="italic">Law</hi> will force him to pay. Alas, thrift is good; but <hi rend="italic">such</hi> thrift is <hi rend="italic">terrible</hi>.&#x2014; Now remember your promised visit, dear Mother, and how you are <hi rend="italic">due</hi> to us this winter; and be kind to yourself and careful of yourself in the interim.&#x2014; Jane&#x2019;s thanks, our kindest constant Love to you all. <closer><salute>Goodnight and blessings with you!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Foolish Goody Co<hi rend="italic">ad</hi>jutor,</salute>
<p>Was there ever a more foolish order given by any Goody than this of writing thee a Letter, when we have yet been hardly eight-and-forty hours apart, and here in a solitude, in a vacant stillness, of which <pb id="pg-06-432" n="06:432"/>that of La Trappe<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Trappists were a Cistercian order founded in <date when="1140-00-00">1140</date> at Soligny-la-Trappe, a place so named from the narrow gorge which forms its entrance, comparable to a trap-door. The order was characterized by its strict observance of silence.</note> was but a type? No, thou dear little Goody, it was not foolish; so I obey gladly; nay, would perhaps have done it without order. To tell my Co<hi rend="italic">ad</hi>jutor everything has become a want of my life. I have taken, as you see, one of my largest sheets, and will fill it all before I end.</p>
<p>Nancy was hoeing in the Gravel, when Harry, close-followed by me, came up to her; about the hour perhaps when you were quitting MacTurkdom, for your last stage. The wild woman soon realised me a few potatoes, on which with butter and a film or two of that dried beef I dined much to my contentment. The Piano was standing there in the best season; but unhappily there was no hand to put it in motion. To avoid getting into abstruse speculations, I took my hat and went out to walk. Seven Days of the utterest solitude lay before me; yet <hi rend="italic">Days</hi>, as I suggested to myself, of precious <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>; which I might use even here, or misuse. I determined to be heroical, and cast the Devil out of me.</p>
<p>Scarcely however had I reached Stumpy when the figure of Corson, advancing by the side of a dim-looking woman mounted on a white cart-horse, appeared close at hand. Utter solitude, I could now see, was not the worst that might befal one. Corson advanced in his usual gesturing way, and introduced to me in form the dim-looking horse-woman, as &#x201C;Mrs Smith from Speddoch.&#x201D; What Mrs Smith from Speddoch might be, above all what she could want with me, was now the mystery; which the heroine herself proceeded to unfold. To speak seriously, for the thing may actually concern us: it was drunken Doctor Smith&#x2019;s Wife, who has instituted (with great success as she alleged) a sort of small mad-boarding-house, at Speddoch;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Speddoch House is about five miles from Craigenputtoch and ten miles NW of Dumfries, in Holywood parish.</note> and had come up to inquire about poor Grace Welsh,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> having heard from William Gray that she was to be moved. I looked in the woman&#x2019;s face: she has a <foreign>shifty</foreign> [resourceful], assiduous air, not without address and manner; seems copious in speech; of a brisk, garrulous, active perhaps rather kind character: in one word, she is old Mrs Gray&#x2019;s Sister; is Mrs Gray herself, <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>-gigged, and forced to acquire the faculty of <hi rend="italic">walk</hi>ing. She has three Boarders at present, one of them a Miss Something, of rank; all are with her for that very reason of Drink and <pb id="pg-06-433" n="06:433"/>Opium; all, she says, have completely recovered; she never had but another, and that one I think died. Speddoch House is but a bad one: however, if she could get Grace Welsh, she would rent the House of Newtonairds,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A house 7 miles NW of Dumfries on the Dunscore road.</note> close by; where Gillet lived,&#x2014;who by the bye has now gone mad too. Dr Smith&#x2019;s drink, as Corson assures me, does not interfere with the business; &#x201C;as he never drinks at home,&#x201D; or indeed abroad almost,&#x2014;having I suppose no cash. I inquired of the Dame what her Terms were; but she with the most diplomatic air avoided throwing any light on that. How far all this may be of any consequence for you I have too little light by much for determining; your Mother and you will be best able to judge. One thing is clear: the poor young lady would be nearer all her friends there; another thing seems probable that her keeperess would actually <hi rend="italic">address</hi> herself to take charge of her. The rest seems all dubious, perhaps almost questionable. Think of it yourselves. I of course told Goody Smith that nothing <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be told at present, that it was not even certain whether Miss Welsh was to be moved at all, but within two weeks would be decided on: if No, I agreed to send her a line to that effect; if Yes, she might perhaps hear of us some other way;&#x2014;and so I sent her back to Speddoch; and took Corson with me to the Grave of the last Sixpence, and did not get rid of him till supper-time.</p>
<p>From the boundless flood of &#x201C;mad and mad-making&#x201D; <foreign><hi rend="italic">claver</hi></foreign> that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> emitted, take now these slight Biographic notices, which constitute my whole stock of scandal. That <foreign><hi rend="italic">parvus puer</hi></foreign> [poor boy], heir-apparent of Auchenhay, is dead;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neither Auchenhay nor his heir-apparent have been identified.</note> since the day of its reputed Father&#x2019;s funeral. Neither was the thing (I mean the birth of it) in the smallest <hi rend="italic">pathetic</hi>, as you would make it; but rather the <hi rend="italic">reverse</hi>. Old Auchenhay knew nothing of it, believed nothing of it (there seems to be <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> of this); and it is openly suspected, some&#x2014;god may have intervened! It was a <foreign><hi rend="italic">dignus vindice nodus</hi></foreign> [knot worthy of an avenger], if one ever was. There was surely some more Biography the Fool told me: but it has evaporated,&#x2014;I fear, without return.&#x2014;</p>
<p>At this interesting point of my Letter, it has struck 10 o&#x2019;clock, and I have had my supper. Were the Goodykin here, she would send me to bed; but I am a free man, and keep writing. Dear Goody! I wish she were here nevertheless. One is &#x201C;all-too lonely in that wide bed,&#x201D; in this wide Moor, in this wide Universe!&#x2014; However I must forward with my history; and surely in a rather more <hi rend="italic">succinct</hi> manner. Yesterday morning, while the bright sun was welcoming you (I hope, without <pb id="pg-06-434" n="06:434"/>headache) to the Watering-place, I stirred little, yet was not wholly idle: I adjusted various small matters; wrote a long Letter to poor Mrs Swan; a long one, yet the lamest utterance of my feeling on that sad matter; for I was stupid, and could not even <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> my feeling rightly, much less <hi rend="italic">think</hi> it.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Provost William Swan of Kirkcaldy had just died. On <date when="1833-09-06">6 Sept.</date> Carlyle referred to him in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> as &#x201C;an old and worthy friend&#x201D; and said, &#x201C;He was one of the best-conditioned men, active sagacious, beneficent joyfully productive in his little circle, that I knew in the world.&#x201D;</note> After Dinner, I went to walk. Sitting with my back at the big stone in the &#x201C;Sixpence,&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">English Traits</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Prose Works</hi> (Boston, <date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>), II, 165, Emerson wrote of Carlyle: &#x201C;He had names of his own for all the matters familiar to his discourse &#x2026; a piece of road near by, that marked some failed enterprise was &#x2018;the Grave of the last Sixpence.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> looking out over the void Moor, I hear a little squeak of glad unmelodious singing; and presently Midge, in red jacket, with a bundle, heaves in sight; dashes back astonished into a kind of minuet, answers my question with a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Sur?</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;and then to the repitition [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of it, &#x201C;How they were all at the Hut?&#x201D; chirps out, with the strangest, new, old-woman&#x2019;s tone, &#x201C;Oh! bravely&#x201D;: poor little savage! I met her again in the way back (she had been with Nancy&#x2019;s gown, I suppose), and did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> kill her with my eyes, but let her shy past me. The red Midge in that vacant wilderness might have given Wordsworth a Sonnet. All day, I must remark, Nancy had been busy as a town taken by storm, and indeed still is, tho&#x2019; I know not with what: most probably washing I think; for yesterday there appeared once a barrow with something like clothes-baskets, and today white sheets swung triumphantly on the rope: she gets me all my necessaries quite punctually, and, as fit, no questions are asked. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Noty-bena</hi></foreign>,&#x201D; after a long effort, I remembered the shelling of your peas, and told her of it.&#x2014; After tea, I did&#x2014;what think you? Composed the following beautiful Doggrel on the Linn of Crichope,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A glen with ravine near Templand (see J. M. Sloan, <hi rend="italic">The Carlyle Country</hi> [London, <date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>], p. 218), part of which is a very narrow sandstone cleft, one used as a refuge by Covenanters, suggesting to Scott the idea for Balfour of Burley&#x2019;s lair in <hi rend="italic">Old Mortality</hi>. Carlyle could have visited it recently, for as he says in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, he had carried Jane to Templand a few days before, where she joined her mother and Helen Welsh for a visit to Moffat.</note> and fair Ludovina (I hope, she is fair): quite a jewel of a piece;&#x2014;for which however there is not room on this page. Say not that I am idle: I even determined to keep a Diary for these seven Days, to see how I should spend them and let it be seen. Of the present Saturday the grandest event might be the following. Sickish with little work, I took my walk <hi rend="italic">before</hi> dinner: reaching home, at the corner of the house, I meet a pig apparently in a state of distraction (grating harsh thunder, its <pb id="pg-06-435" n="06:435"/>lugs o&#x2019;er its shoulders distractedly flow), pursued by Nancy in the same! The Sow has not so much broken the Gate as rent it, the sideposts of it, into two, and left it hanging &#x201C;like a bundle of flails.&#x201D; After dinner, I with a sublime patience borrow &#x201C;Joseph&#x2019;s <foreign>wimble</foreign> [gimlet],&#x201D; and under ten thousand midge-bites, with tools blunt as a wild Indian&#x2019;s, <hi rend="italic">actually</hi> construct a bran-new, much-improved Gate; which you shall look upon not without admiration,&#x2014;if it swing so long. I sent a new message to the Joiner; but do not in the least expect him. I had meant to excerpt from <hi rend="italic">Bayle</hi>, and such like; but the fates, you see, had mostly ordered it <hi rend="italic">otherwise</hi>. However, Night found me, like Basil Montague, &#x201C;at my post&#x201D;; namely, at my gate-post, and nigh done with it: I had tea, and Goody&#x2019;s Letter (for it is hers, as well as mine); and so here we are.</p>
<p>But now, Dear Wifie, it is fit I turn a moment to thy side. Is my little Janekin getting any sleep in that unknown Cabin? Is she enjoying aught; hoping aught,&#x2014;except the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of it, which <hi rend="italic">is</hi> and should be one of her hopes? I shall learn &#x201C;all&#x201D; on Wednesday (for she will write as I do); and then &#x201C;all and everything&#x201D;&#x2014;when? I am patient as possible, hitherto; and my patience will stretch if I know that you enjoy yourself, still more that your health seems to profit. Take a little amusement, dear Goody, if thou canst get it: God knows, little comes to thee with me, and thou art right patient under it. But, Courage, my Dearest! I swear, better days are coming, <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> come. The accursed baleful cloud that has hung over my existence <hi rend="italic">must</hi> (I feel it) dissipate, and let in the Sun, which shines on <hi rend="italic">all</hi>. It <hi rend="italic">must</hi>, I say: what is it but a cloud; properly a <hi rend="italic">shadow</hi>, a chimera! O Jeannie!&#x2014; But enough: if I am happy, art not thou also happy in my happiness? Hope <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things, Dearest; and be true to me still, as thou wert and art. And so <foreign><hi rend="italic">felicissima Notte</hi></foreign> [happiest night]! Keep well, for it is now midnight; and dream of me if thou canst.

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Instead of a Letter you here as sometimes formerly get the mere sham of a Letter; a kind of decoy to induce you to write in return to it. Why I have not sooner replied to your last<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had not yet received Mill&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1833-09-05">5 Sept.</date> and refers to that of <date when="1833-08-02">2 Aug.</date></note> were long to tell: I have <hi rend="italic">spoken</hi> more than usual in that interval, yet inwardly was rarely more <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, or had more need of silence. Besides, I almost daily expected to have your arrival announced as at hand. This afternoon there can be but one measured half-hour yours, and that the stupidest of the day. We are very unfortunate.</p>
<p>John tells me you are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> coming!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Although John&#x2019;s last letter to Carlyle has not been found, his letter to his mother of <date when="1833-08-31">31 Aug.</date> is extant. In it he says: &#x201C;I have seen Mr. Mill twice, &#x26; he told me yesterday that he will not be able to come to Craigenputtoch this year. I have got some books from him to send, &#x26; along with them will come some from myself also.&#x201D; Mill wrote Carlyle on <date when="1833-09-05">5 Sept.</date> that duty compelled him to undertake a journey to Paris rather than to Craigenputtoch. He added that the books from him which Dr. Carlyle was sending were &#x201C;two Reports of the Factory Commission, full of the <hi rend="italic">biography</hi> of history; the works of Madame Roland, the noblest character by far of the French Revolution, perhaps of France itself; though far from the most brilliant; &#x26; the two numbers of the Repository which contain my flimsy paper on Alison.&#x201D;</note> Thus does the long outlook of two twelvemonths prove to be no Castle of Pleasance, but a mere Aircastle, and vanishes when you lift the knocker! Alas, it is like so much else in this weary Land of Shadows. Our regret I can well assure you is real: but what can we do? Wander on; and see what the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> piece of road will yield us. Or is there not still some possibility? It were unfriendly to urge you, if your necessity calls the other way: neither do I; beyond what you see. For one thing, in any case, be more and more diligent in writing; that London and you be still kept in some measure present to me. No Letters, I feel, can be more <hi rend="italic">authentic</hi> than yours; there are few relations with any man that could be freer from <hi rend="italic">harm</hi> than this with you. Let us do what we can. Another day will bring us together again face to face&#x2014;I hope, in a much improved condition.</p>
<p>For many years (seven, I think) the Pen has not been so long out of my hand as even now. A multitude of things required and require adjustment in me: it was a great kindness in my destiny too that <pb id="pg-06-438" n="06:438"/>precisely at this period I could pause without economical inconvenience, the first time I have had any inward wish to pause. I feel sometimes that I am not idle, tho&#x2019; unemployed to the eye. We shall see what will come of it. In some week or two, however, I shall probably be again at my Desk; according to my old maxim that one should not puzzle, should not speculate, but having got even a little light, go instantly to <hi rend="italic">work</hi> with it, that it may become <hi rend="italic">more</hi>. I have a general feeling growing of late years that &#x201C;I am all in the wrong&#x201D;;&#x2014;and, by the Devil&#x2019;s malice, shall always have it, for we live in a Dualistic world. Strange how in ourselves, as in all earthly things, a little nucleus of Truth and Good rolls itself on in a huge comet-like environment of Error and Delusion; and yet at length in some degree the Error and Delusion evaporate and vanish (as Nonentities, mere Negations) and the fraction of Good is <hi rend="italic">found</hi> to be a reality!</p>
<lg><l>&#x201C;What shall I teach thee, the foremost thing?&#x201D;</l>
<l>Couldst teach me off <hi rend="italic">my own Shadow</hi> to spring!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Translation of an epigram from Goethe. See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 154; <hi rend="italic">The Life of John Sterling, Works</hi>, XI, 130.</note></l></lg>
<p>In Heaven, I suppose, we shall have no Shadow; but here, on this Earth, thro&#x2019; soul and thro&#x2019; body it goes chacing you at the frightfullest rate.</p>
<p>Emerson, your Presentee, rolled up hither, one still Sunday afternoon while we sat at dinner. A most gentle, recommendable, amiable, whole-hearted man; whom we thank for one of the pleasantest interruptions to our solitude. He staid with us four and twenty hours; and was thro&#x2019; the whole Encyclopedia with me in that time. A good &#x201C;Socinian&#x201D; understanding, the clearest heart; above all what I loved in the man was his health, his unity with himself; all people and all things seemed to find their quite peaceable adjustment with him, not a proud domineering one, as after doubtful <hi rend="italic">contest</hi>, but a spontaneous-looking, peaceable, even humble one. I should henceforth learn to see, or see better, that Unitarians are not hollow men, but at worst limited men, and otherwise of the fairest conditions. Their very need of a religion, stron<supplied>[g]</supplied>ly evinced in that creed of theirs, should recommend them. One seems to believe almost all that they believe; and when they stop short and call it a Religion, and you pass on, and call it only a reminiscence of one, should you not part with the kiss of peace?</p>
<p>Of Gustave this good Emerson could tell me almost nothing, except that he was at Naples, with seemingly an uncertain aim before him if any. I feel much interest in poor Gustave: of all Saint-Simonians <hi rend="italic">he</hi> <pb id="pg-06-439" n="06:439"/>probably was the truest, his disappointment will be the deepest. Bring me home news of him, if possible; convey to him also my friendliest wishes, if you have opportunity.</p>
<p>John hints briefly that you are for Paris. A <hi rend="italic">different</hi> destination from the hitherward one! I shall have a thousand questions to ask; or rather to wish to ask, for most of them will remain <hi rend="italic">un</hi>asked. Investigate for me, report to me all that interests yourself most: it is sure of interesting me too. The &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Literature</hi> of Despair&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written (<date when="1833-08-02">2 Aug.</date>) that his notion of Paris was taken &#x201C;from its recent literature, which <hi rend="italic">is</hi> exactly what Goethe called it, the literature of Despair&#x2014;<foreign>die Litteratur der Verzweiflung</foreign>,&#x201D; and he used the expression again in a letter to TC of <date when="1833-11-25">25 Nov.</date></note> is indeed a desperate one for the present; perhaps also the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Conduct</hi> of Despair&#x201D;: yet both <hi rend="italic">will</hi> have their fruit. In the latter at least there is an energy and greatness, which if it spring <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Despair, <hi rend="italic">points</hi> quite elsewhither. You will also buy some Books? Especially more <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires!</hi> That <hi rend="italic">Cent-et-un</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330418-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-04-18">18 April</date></ref>.</note> I read some volumes of, and beyond the palpablest &#x201C;Despair&#x201D; found little in.

<p>Thank you for your sketch of Grote.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Mill&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1833-08-02">2 Aug.</date> for an excellent analysis of Grote&#x2019;s mind and character.</note> I know nothing of the Lawyer <supplied>[you]</supplied> mention but the name.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had referred to &#x201C;Bickersteth (the most valuable man in the profession of law&#x2014;do you know about him?),&#x201D; meaning Henry Bickersteth, first Baron Langdale (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), master of the rolls, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>, and temporarily speaker of the House of Lords, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>; friend of Bentham and James Mill, who helped arrange for John Austin to lecture for the Society of the Inner Temple.</note> Send me him too if you like, and all persons of any self-subsistency.

<p>Perhaps there will be a Letter from you tomorrow? I shall see from it who is to write again.</p>
<p>My Wife is at Moffat, a watering-place in the East of this County; she is with her Mother and Cousin there for a week, and I the loneliest man your very imagination could figure. I literally do not speak five words a-day. A &#x201C;Scotch Brownie&#x201D; of a servant silently provides for me all that I want and more; there is no human being that I have <pb id="pg-06-440" n="06:440"/>anything to say to.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>If you called at the usual time, you would be disappointed in the Newspapers; for in truth they were only this day put into the Thornhill Post-Office, and cannot yet have got the length of Dumfries. I had myself been disappointed; that was the reason. Gracie of Sandywell was to bring the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> last week, and literally did so: but the Postmaster forgot the Papers, as I conjecture, and then took pains to deliver them to &#x201C;Nethertown,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A hamlet two or three miles from Dunscore on the way to Craigenputtoch.</note> who, good easy man, allowed them to lie quietly by him till <hi rend="italic">yesterday morning</hi> when I, by a kind of accident having heard that they were there, called and got them. We will try to avoid such mischances in future; of which, indeed, it is perhaps strange that so <hi rend="italic">few</hi> befal us here. However, the present one has proved a gain on the whole: for I, hearing nothing of the Newspapers, directed the Minnyhive carrier to call for them on Saturday; who, of course, brought me no Newspapers, yet something far better, namely this inclosed Letter from the Doctor, which otherwise I must have waited for till Wednesday, and you till Wednesday week. So putting one thing to another, we will rather rejoice than grumble.</p>
<p>Poor Jack, as you will find, has got safe over the Water, and begins his expedition as prosperously as could be wished. There is no more <hi rend="italic">sailing</hi> now; nothing but the finest country in all Europe to roll thro&#x2019;, where the people will all be gathering their grapes (during these weeks) to make Rhine-wine of, and singing their vintage-song, as merry as <hi rend="italic">maltmen</hi>, or rather as <hi rend="italic">grape</hi>-men, who have a still better right to be merry. Jack has plucked up his spirits too; the travelling party promises to be agreeable; and all to prove favourable. So we will wish <pb id="pg-06-441" n="06:441"/>him heartily good speed; and wait with hope that of this too good may come and not evil. We have great reason to be thankful, that amid unnumbered perils we and so many dear to us are still saved alive, to see good, and to do good (if we will) in the Land of Living,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 28:13.</note> in the Place of Hope. You will read in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> that fearful shipwreck of the Amphitrite,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Amphitrite</hi> was a convict-ship, driven on shore near Boulogne on <date when="1833-08-30">30 August</date>, when of over 130 crew and convicts all but three of the crew were drowned. They might have been saved but for the hesitation of the captain over releasing the convicts. 108 of the convicts were female, and 12 children were among the victims. See <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1833-09-08">8 Sept.</date>, pp. 572&#x2013;73.</note> one of the horridest things ever recorded: that happened on the friday-night (before that &#x201C;shake-wind,&#x201D;&#x2014;it was a <hi rend="italic">death</hi>-wind there)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The same issue of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> reports that 59 vessels were reported lost from every part of the English coast with the gale of <date when="1833-08-30">30</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-08-31">31 August</date>, with great loss of life.</note> not above twenty miles off where John was landed safe on the following Monday. These have all fearfully perished; he and we are left alive.</p>
<p>When our Doctor will write again he does not say. It will be some five weeks, I think, before he can get the Letter he appoints me to write him: but probably he will write to some of us before that; from Switzerland or wherever he has a little day of rest. At this time he is perhaps in Brussels, a gay Capital such as Edinburgh: he goes eastward next into Germany, and then up the Rhine (part of his old route to Munich); and so on towards the Swiss Alps where that river springs; a beautiful road. Most likely he will pass thro&#x2019; Constance, where our noble Huss<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Huss (ca. <date when="1373-00-00">1373</date>&#x2013;<date when="1415-00-00">1415</date>), Bohemian preacher of the Reformation, convicted of heresy by the Council of Constance and burnt alive. His ashes were scattered in the Rhine.</note> testified to the death: he may tell us what he says to his &#x201C;scarlet woman&#x201D; and her abominations there! You and I shall not be with him to lecture from that text; but his own thought (for all that he talks so) will do it. The dumb ashes of Huss speak louder than a thousand sermons.</p>
<p>But I must tell you something now of myself: for I know many a morning, my dear Mother, you &#x201C;come in by me&#x201D; in your rambles thro&#x2019; the world after those precious to you. If you had eyes to see on these occasions, you would find everything quite tolerable here. I have been rather <hi rend="italic">busy</hi>, tho&#x2019; the fruit of my work is rather inward and has little to show for itself; I have yet hardly put pen to paper: but foresee that there is a time coming. <hi rend="italic">All</hi> my griefs, I can better and better see, lie in good measure at my own door; were I right <hi rend="italic">in my own heart</hi>, <pb id="pg-06-442" n="06:442"/>nothing else would be far wrong with me: this, as you well understand, is true of every mortal; and I advise all that hear me to <hi rend="italic">believe it</hi>, and lay it practically to their own case. On the whole, I am promising to occupy myself more wholesomely, and to be happier here all winter, than I have been of late. &#x201C;Be diligent in well-doing&#x201D;;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gal. 6:9.</note> that is the only secret for happiness anywhere: not a <hi rend="italic">universal</hi> one or infallible (so long as we continue on Earth); yet far the best we have.</p>
<p>For the last two weeks till this day Jane has been away from me; at Moffat with her Mother and Cousin most of the time. I led the loneliest life, I suppose, of any human creature in the King&#x2019;s dominions; yet managed wonderfully by keeping myself continually in work. I clomb to the Hill-top one Sabbath-day for my walk; and saw Burnswark, and fancied you all at the Sermon close by. I was down at Dunscore another day, and thence with the Minister to see the Barjarg Library, which I have some hopes of getting admittance to, a favour that would be very useful here.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Barjarg is a country house and estate in Keir parish, Dumfriesshire, 3&#xBD; miles south of Thornhill, then belonging to Godolphin Hunter Arundell, a student at Edinburgh University, nephew of Rev. John Hunter (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), second charge minister of the Tron Church at Edinburgh, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>. The estate had been bought, and the library formed, by the latter&#x2019;s father, Professor Andrew Hunter (<date when="1743-00-00">1743</date>&#x2013;<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>), also minister of the Tron Church, and professor of divinity at Edinburgh, <date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>. The additional name of Arundell had been taken by Andrew Hunter&#x2019;s son, William Francis (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>) in <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>. It was the Rev. John Hunter who (for some reason) procured Carlyle access to Barjarg Library, though at this time they had not met. On <date when="1833-09-12">12 Sept.</date> he wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> that he had gone with the minister Bryden to Barjarg to see the library, had seen Mrs. Hunter, &#x201C;a dainty-speaking, cold, ceremonious-looking dame,&#x201D; who did not know of her husband&#x2019;s letter and said that she would let Carlyle know when she had found out &#x201C;what extent of privilege he meant it to include,&#x201D; and had concluded that it was a handsome library which would be very useful to him if &#x201C;freely conceded.&#x201D; The way was cleared, however, and by <date when="1833-10-02">2 October</date> he noted in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> that he was reading extensively in the library.</note> Another evening there came up to me the poor youth Gray,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Gray, the Oxford student. Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300211-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-02-11">11 Feb. 1830</date></ref>.</note> whom you have heard me speak of; a miserable, almost shocking sort of figure, ruined by vanity and whisky; resembling Badams in his condition. I was heartily sorry for him; but relieved when he went away; and on the whole best contented when left to myself altogether. Wattie Johnston (Macadam<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>s father-in-law) was another interruption: but with him I made rather short work; such as he seemed to merit and require.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1833-09-11">11 September</date> Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;There came to interrupt me the foolishest clattering old man, Wattie Johnstone, with whom I had as little concern as with any son of Adam. &#x2026; The speech of the man was not so bad; nay rather an ingenuous, open, graphical sort of speech: <hi rend="italic">but there was no end of it</hi>, there was no question about <hi rend="italic">your</hi> tastes in it. I never heard so determined a Talker except Coleridge, and this was alas no Coleridge, only Wattie.&#x201D;</note> Finally on Monday <pb id="pg-06-443" n="06:443"/>morning (yesterday) I went over to Templand, and found my bit Wifie, altogether <foreign><hi rend="italic">defaite</hi></foreign> [exhausted], not a whit better but worse of Moffat and i<supplied>[t]</supplied>s baths, and declaring she would not leave me so soon again in a hurry. I had sanctioned and advised her going; but was glad enough to see her back, and so glad to get back. We are here again safe, and ought to settle ourselves a while. She had seen the Andersons,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Formerly of Stroquhan, near Craigenputtoch.</note> all better than when here: &#x201C;Betty Smeal<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280800-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>4:395</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1828-08-23">23 Aug. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> doing excellently.&#x201D; It is true enough that John Anderson is to Law about the Estate; and some say will get it; is sure of a good Lawsuit at any rate. It is said to be for his Mother&#x2019;s sake mainly that he makes this attempt: for whose sake he likes, I doubt it is no fair one.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330827-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1833-08-27">27 Aug.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>I think of you all here daily; am <foreign>wae</foreign> for the harvesters on wet days, and wonder whether my Mother is well, and what the rest are all doing. Thank Jean for her most seasonable little note; tell Jamie there is a line in the Doctor&#x2019;s letter, which he ought particularly to note. Jean will write to me again; perhaps next Wednesday? I long to hear how <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are, dear Mother: I join earnestly in John&#x2019;s entreaty and caution, that you would be careful of yourself; at this season especially. She must tell me also when you are coming up, or any of the rest. Alick and Jamie I suppose will be here at Roodfair time<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320918-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1832-09-18">18 Sept. 1832</date></ref>.</note> (which cannot be far distant now: will none of the rest come with them?<supplied>[)]</supplied> As for me, I think I must put something on paper before I come down again, be that when it may: it will be kind of spur to me, if I need one;&#x2014;or rather &#x201C;a sheaf of corn at the far end&#x201D;! <hi rend="italic">You</hi> however I am bound to fetch (in the <hi rend="italic">Clatch</hi>) and take back whenever you determine.</p>
<p>My large sheet is almost done. I have had the worst of pens; and, I doubt, have more than once brought Jean to a <hi rend="italic">nonplus</hi>. You will gather this from it, that I am as well as usual, that you are all as dear to me as of old&#x2014; Again I request Jean to tell me by some Note or sign (two strokes on a Newspaper-cover, or anything) that you, my dear Mother, are well. Take care of yourself dear Mother; for sake of us all. My kind love and prayers for every one of you. May He watch over you whose eye never sleeps! In this world of shadows may we all <pb id="pg-06-444" n="06:444"/>look towards the world of realities, &#x201C;that city which <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> foundations!&#x201D;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>I send a Magazine, tho&#x2019; I suppose you have little time at present.&#x2014; Tell Jean I got both the Manchester papers; also the parcels quite regularly, and direct, by John Shaw.</p>
<p>Tell Alick (with my love) that I have been looking to him these several weeks to get me some stock of old <hi rend="italic">horse-corn;</hi> for Peter can get me no more in the glen. M&#x2019;Adam brought us a little pokeful from Dumfries to keep things going; we have in all perhaps something like a Carlisle bushel. If Jamie have any grain left, of course it is all one; but I recollected ricks at Alick&#x2019;s, and thought of a Cart at roodfair: I can take a sack of oats or more (for there is a barrel too).</p>
<p>This old black coat was left me by Jack; but I have a blue one in much the same condition: so I send this down to Jamie Austin to try if it will fit him. If the sleeves are too short, new <hi rend="italic">cuffs</hi> might improve them. At all rates, it will make spencers for &#x201C;Fill&#x2019;t-mi-wi&#x2019;-potch,&#x201D;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The expression means &#x201C;Fill it for me with porridge&#x201D; and may have been used by some notorious beggar or scrounger.</note> and characters of that stamp.&#x2014; I have the Picture here, which is meant for you, but not framed yet.&#x2014; My Compliments to Burnswark<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham.</note> if you see him: he would tell you that he was here.&#x2014; Jane&#x2019;s best love to you all. She thinks about <hi rend="italic">thirty</hi> pounds of butter will serve; and she wants it in 3 little pots, 10 lb each: she has Pots here; but expects to see some &#x201C;conveyance&#x201D; here before Roodsmas, and settle it then.&#x2014; Again, good-night.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Our Letters<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1833-09-05">5 Sept.</date> and Carlyle&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1833-09-10">10 Sept.</date></note> met each other (and passed without recognition) at Dumfries. As mine professed only to be the semblance of a Letter, it <pb id="pg-06-445" n="06:445"/>seems fit that I first write again. Perhaps you will have time to answer me still before leaving England: in any case you will think of me the better in France, and feel yourself in my debt.</p>
<p>No hope now remaining of your presence here this Autumn, we must even give it up, like so much else; and try to create a new one. Blessings on the &#x201C;good time coming&#x201D;! Were it not for the future tense, the past and the present would lose half their value; our <hi rend="small-caps">Time-word</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Anglice</hi>, <hi rend="small-caps">verb</hi>) were all-too incomplete in this world. One of my chief anticipations from your visit was that we might, in reality, get better acquainted here: we are so like two Spirits to one another, two Thinking-machines. Let us hold by that, however, and study to extend it, till we get more. If I had shown you my book-presses here, my refectories, dormitories, even stalls and coal-houses, my whole terrestrial clay-environment, you would have seen me infinitely better, and loved me more, felt more authorized to love me. But, as the Philosophers say, &#x201C;What good is it&#x201D;? Let us do the best we can.</p>
<p>I received your Books last Wednesday, together with a great packet from my Brother. The little Paper on <hi rend="italic">Alison</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330418-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-04-18">18 April</date></ref> Mill deals with the first two volumes of Alison&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Europe during the French Revolution</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository</hi>, N.S., VII (<date when="1833-07-00">July</date>, <date when="1833-08-00">Aug., 1833</date>), 507&#x2013;11, 513&#x2013;16.</note> was the first thing I fell upon; a thing I read carefully and even twice. There is not a word in it that I do not subscribe to: it is really a <hi rend="italic">decided</hi> little utterance, with a quiet emphasis, a conscious incontrovertibility, which (heretic that I am) I rejoice to see growing in you. Such a feeling, such a mode of writing seems to me, in these days especially, the only fruitful one: emphasis in uttering, what is it but the natural result of entireness in believing; the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> condition of all worth in words spoken, and quite especially precious in a despicable sceptical, &#x201C;supposing,&#x201D; weathercock, foundationless era such as ours. Give me, above and before all things, a man that has legs to stand on: keep far from me, were it possible, the innumerable decrepit <foreign><hi rend="italic">culs-de-jatte</hi></foreign> [cripples], that can stand, that can move nowhere, but only beg permission of all byestanders to move <hi rend="italic">whithersoever they are shoved!</hi> You perceive, therefore, I set little store by this so celebrated virtue of Tolerance: alas, I cannot say that I have almost ever seen such a virtue; only seen, often enough and with ever-increasing dislike, Indifferentism parading itself in the stolen garments of it. &#x201C;I came not into the world to bring peace, but a sword&#x201D;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 10:34.</note> Such is in perhaps all cases part of the stern mission which a good man feels laid on him. How different, <pb id="pg-06-446" n="06:446"/>above all, is that honey-mouthed, tear-stained, soup-kitchen Jesus Christ of our poor shovel-hatted modern Christians from that stern-visaged Christ of the Gospels, proclaiming aloud in the marketplace (with such a total contempt of the social respectabilities): <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Woe</hi> unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, <hi rend="italic">hypocrites&#x201D;!</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 23:13.</note> Descend from your Gigs, ye wretched scoundrels, for the hour is come!&#x2014;</p>
<p>As for this business of the French Revolution I think you ought to determine on setting forth your ideas and acquisitions in regard to it at more length than you have ever yet done; and that by your first opportunity, with your best deliberation. It is properly the grand <hi rend="italic">work</hi> of our era (a most sorrowful, barren and unfruitful work, yet still the work which was laid on us, which we have done, and are doing): in this, in the right understanding of this, is involved all possible knowledge important for us; and yet at the present hour our ignorance of it in England is probably as bad as total (for Error is infinitely worse than Ignorance); and in France itself knowledge seems only just beginning. <hi rend="italic">Understand</hi> me all those sectionary tumults, convention-harangues, guillotine holocausts, Brunswick discomfitures; exhaust me the meaning of it! You <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi>; for it is a flaming <hi rend="italic">Reality</hi>; the depths of Eternity look thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">chinks</hi> of that so <hi rend="italic">convulsed</hi> section of Time;&#x2014;as thro <hi rend="italic">all</hi> sections of Time, only to dull eyes not so visibly. To me, it often seems, as if the right <hi rend="italic">History</hi> (that impossible thing I mean by History) of the French Revolution were the grand Poem of our Time; as if the man who <hi rend="italic">could</hi> write the <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> of that, were worth all other writers and singers. If I were spared alive myself, and had means, why might not I too prepare the way for such a thing? I assure you the attempt often seems among my possibilities. The attempt <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be made; cannot, by the highest talent and effort, be succeeded in, except in more or less feeble approximation. But indeed is not all our success approximate only?&#x2014; In any case I continue thoroughly interested in the subject, and greedily collect whatever knowledge I can of it. That <hi rend="italic">Thiers</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330112-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-01-12">12 Jan.</date></ref></note> these <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires</hi> of yours have done more for me than almost all else I had read; you can hardly conceive with what a tumult of feelings, visions, half-visions, guesses and darknesses they wholly envelope me. Whatever more of such you have pray get me. I spent yesterday with Madame Roland;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330613-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-06-13">13 June</date></ref>.</note> a most remarkable woman; one of the clearest, bravest, perhaps as you say <pb id="pg-06-447" n="06:447"/><hi rend="italic">best</hi> of her sex and country; tho&#x2019; (as indeed her time prescribed) almost rather a man than a woman. I prefer her, however, to de Stael, on several grounds: on this, were it on no other, that she utterly divests herself of <hi rend="italic">cant</hi>, which the spiritual Amazon never could even resolutely try to do. But on the whole what a contrast are these two! Of the other book-figures I think <hi rend="italic">Riouffe</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Honor&#xE9; Riouffe (<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>), baron, one of the Girondins, author of <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires d&#x2019;un d&#xE9;tenu pour servir &#xE0; l&#x2019;histoire de la tyrannie de Robespierre</hi> (Paris, <date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1795-00-00">5</date>), for whose testimony concerning Mme Roland see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution, Works,</hi> IV, 209&#x2013;10.</note> dwells most with me; he and the other Prison men, especially that little citizen Versifier, and his jaunty ways with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Citoyennes:</hi></foreign> it was all to me like the grandest Drama I had ever assisted at.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The phrases &#x201C;flaming <hi rend="italic">Reality</hi>,&#x201D; &#x201C;grand poem,&#x201D; and &#x201C;grandest Drama&#x201D; in this passage anticipate significantly Carlyle&#x2019;s later treatment of the subject.</note></p>
<p>But now in connexion with these fine speculations let me tell you some little practical things I will have you do for me at Paris. The first is to ascertain by comparison of me and that city how you imagine I could contrive to live there for a few months: I mean not only spiritually, socially, but economically, <foreign><hi rend="italic">crumenically</hi></foreign> [purse-wise]. What think you is the lowest sum for which a couple such <supplied>[as]</supplied> you know us could contrive to subsist there, so as (dismounting altogether from the <hi rend="italic">Gig</hi>) to go on w<supplied>[ith]</supplied> fair chance in the way of intellectual investigation? Are there furnished houses or huts to be had about any of the circumjacent villages, where you can keep your own servant; and at what rate? Should one find the French Notabilities (I mean Literary and Artistic&#x2014;if indeed there <hi rend="italic">be</hi> any such) accessible, communicative? Libraries I know there are, not how available they are. The thing I want to understand is French Existence, French History, especially the recent portion of it: you can tell me what resources, from Books, from Men, from personal inspection I should find there more than elsewhere; we shall then, weighing outlay with value to be anticipated, know better how it stands. Another thing I need, perhaps attainable enough: a good French Dictionary! I have got old <hi rend="italic">Richelet</hi> in two folios,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pierre Richelet (<date when="1631-00-00">1631</date>&#x2013;<date when="1698-00-00">98</date>), <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire fran&#x26;ccedil;aise</hi> (Geneva, <date when="1679-00-00">1679</date>&#x2013;<date when="1680-00-00">80</date>); according to Hill Shine, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s Early Reading</hi>, p. 312, Carlyle&#x2019;s copy was in two vols., <date when="1719-00-00">1719</date>, signed and dated <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>.</note> very useful for my <hi rend="italic">Bayle</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March</date></ref>.</note> and whatever is earlier; and then three or four wretched French-English ones, which daily in attempting to use them I feel inclined to burn. The Academy Dictionary is not of my sort; a little vocabulary of any sort that contained <hi rend="italic">all</hi> <pb id="pg-06-448" n="06:448"/>kinds of words, vulgar and royal, and gave even the feeblest interpretation were far better for me than your <hi rend="italic">Cruscan</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Della Crusca</hi> was the name of an academy established at Florence in <date when="1582-00-00">1582</date> to sift and purify the Italian language. The first edition of its dictionary appeared in <date when="1612-00-00">1612</date>.</note> (&#x201C;sifting&#x201D;) sort, for often the &#x201C;siftings&#x201D; are the very thing I am in quest of. You can probably name me a name here; that I think is all I shall ask at present.</p>
<p>My sheet is turned the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> way already, and I am hardly begun writing! That is the misery of Letters. I had much to tell you about my way of life here; still an <hi rend="italic">inkless</hi> one, still an unsettled one. My last letter was written in the extremity of solitude; I write now from a house full of the wretchedest company,&#x2014;whom I have left drinking in another room: God help them! I have many projects for the winter, and hope not to waste it, perhaps least of all if it prove a silent one; which however is not likely. Poor Glen is still in the Glasgow Asylum, one of the many <hi rend="italic">broken promises</hi> one sees and sighs over. Another of them is at the bottle and glass here close by me. Alas! alas!&#x2014; Glen&#x2019;s brother was here last week, and we had much council about the poor fellow; of whom I have not given up hope: we made a sort of plan you will hear of by &#x26; by<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>John, I fancy, is by this time past Frankfort journeying up the Rhine; not to rest till Lausanne or even Milan. I am glad you like him, and prepare to know him: may it prove for good to both! He is a man of perhaps naturally sceptical intellect, but who has (with great agony) <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> the scepticism out of him, and now stands assured of several things, on a basis that neither man nor Devil can push him from: a thoroughly <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> man, with much talent yet undeveloped in him; a broad laughter-loving fellow, yet of deepest earnestness; with an inexhaustible fund of affection and massive <foreign><hi rend="italic">bonhommie:</hi></foreign> love him as well as you can <hi rend="italic">without fear</hi>. Of you he thinks all that is good and handsome; only that perhaps &#x201C;too logical&#x201D; is your excess. If so, reduce it by strengthening <hi rend="italic">the antagonist muscle</hi>. You understand that; and it means, in human culture, a great deal. <hi rend="italic">Weaken</hi> nothing; strengthen the opposite of what is too strong.</p>
<p>You surprise me greatly by liking <hi rend="italic">Cagliostro</hi>; as indeed your likings and dislikings in these cases have shown me more than once how little I yet understand you. As it is the rarest of all things to get any fraction of sincere criticism I feel always much gratified with your approval; heartily thankful for your so kindly expressed censure; that too I know still better to be genuine. You are right about my style; <pb id="pg-06-449" n="06:449"/>your interrogatory is right.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had said in his letter of <date when="1833-09-05">5 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;About that Cagliostro and that Teufelsdreck, by the way, it has frequently occurred to me of late to ask of myself and also of you, whether that mode of writing between sarcasm or irony and earnest, be really deserving of so much honour as you give to it by making use of it so frequently. I do not say that it is not good: all modes of writing, in the hands of a sincere man, are good, provided they are intelligible. But are there many things, worth saying, and capable of being said in that manner which cannot be as well or better said in a more direct way? The same doubt has occasionally occurred to me respecting much of your phraseology, which fails to bring home your meaning to the comprehension of most readers so well as would perhaps be done by commoner and more familiar phrases: however this last I say with the most perfect submission, because I am sure that every one speaks and writes best in his own mother-tongue, the language in which he thinks.&#x201D;</note> I think often of the matter myself; and <hi rend="italic">see</hi> only that I cannot yet see. Irony is a sharp instrument; but ill to handle without cutting <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>. I cannot justify, yet can too well explain what sets me so often on it of late: it is my singularly anomalous position to the world,&#x2014;and, if you will, my own singularly unreasonable temper. I never know or can even guess what or who my audience is, or whether I have any audience: thus too naturally I adjust myself on the Devil-may-care principle. Besides I have under all my gloom a genuine feeling of the ludicrous; and could have been the merriest of men, <hi rend="italic">had I not</hi> been the sickest &#x26; saddest. Thus stands it: but I tell you I will mend; and what more can man do?</p>
<p>Now I beg of you write with all <hi rend="italic">abandonment;</hi> with all copiousness as to your elder Brother, not caring what you write. And so blessings be with you! My good Dame (from amid her <hi rend="italic">visitorial</hi> Tophet<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Notoriously defiled and a place of sacrifice for children: e.g. Jer. 7:29&#x2013;34. Jane had accompanied her mother to Moffat.</note>) joins truly in the prayer.</p>

<ps><p>I have forgot twice to say that I should like <hi rend="italic">Coningsby</hi> and Bulwers <hi rend="italic">England;</hi><note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Sterling, <hi rend="italic">Arthur Coningsby</hi>, and Edward Bulwer, <hi rend="italic">England and the English</hi>, 2 vols., both anonymous and both London, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>.</note> and indeed <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> almost or altogether that you like. Bulwer is an honest kind of creature, tho&#x2019; none of the strongest; nay perhaps as you once said &#x201C;distinguished <hi rend="italic">most</hi> for his tenuity.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Poorlaw Commission stands on the <hi rend="italic">rich</hi> side of the question, and looks at the poor as <hi rend="italic">things</hi>, who nevertheless are men too. For the rest it is well done; Chadwick&#x2019;s part far the best: and <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a spectacle of baseness, wretchedness, dishonesty; wherein perhaps only this light-gleam (a most <hi rend="italic">electric</hi> one) shines on us that now at last, both <pb id="pg-06-450" n="06:450"/>Magistrate and Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> seem heartily <hi rend="italic">afraid</hi> of the poor, quite <hi rend="italic">heartily</hi> afraid!

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your sheaf of Magazines; which I have devoured with eagerness; and now return, having a free opportunity. When another Mass has accumulated, I hope you will not forget me.</p>
<p>Is it you that publish the <hi rend="italic">Metropolitan?</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321202-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:274</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-12-02">2 Dec. 1832</date></corr></ref>. Bell and Bradfute were the Edinburgh publishers. Saunders and Otley, London, Smith and Son, Glasgow, and W. F.

<p>I have a considerable <hi rend="italic">longing</hi> to see two Books of Mr Babbage&#x2019;s writing; one of them almost a new one. They are called (I think) <hi rend="italic">The Economy of Machinery</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">The Economy of Manufactures;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently one book: Charles Babbage, <hi rend="italic">On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures</hi> (London, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>). Carlyle also asked Mill for this (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320828-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:212</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-08-28">28 Aug. 1832</date></corr></ref>).</note> or some such thing.

<p>I have a Manuscript Book of my own here<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus.</hi></note> (tho&#x2019; this is a sort of secret); which I have some thoughts of making a printed one of, in winter,&#x2014;at my own cost and venture: I mean to ask you some questions about it; and doubt not you will make your light to shine on me.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Book-Parcel reach<supplied>[ed]</supplied> me in safety yesterday: worthy Taggart<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a carrier.</note> could not know that there was a &#x201C;M&#x2019;Knight, Glenessland Carrier,&#x201D; who would have taken it from him, and delivered it that same evening.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your young Artist<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thornton Hunt (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330316-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:347&#x2013;48</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1833-03-16">16 March 1833</date></corr></ref>). In the event he travelled as far as Edinburgh in late <date when="1838-06-00">June</date> but then returned to London overcome with homesickness (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330718-TC-JHLH-01"><sic>6:416</sic><corr>TC to JHLH, <date when="1833-07-18">18 July 1833</date></corr></ref>).</note> shall be most welcome to us, if you will send him, and he will consent to the journey. Let him come, and pioneer the way for his Father; perhaps both of you, some luckier day, may be persuaded thither.</p>
<p>We have removed into this new Dwelling, and have now the choice to continue here till <date when="1833-05-00">May</date>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They stayed until <date when="1833-05-09">9 May</date>.</note> After that, we return to the &#x201C;whinstone stronghold,&#x201D; in the wilderness; and have no prospect of quitting it all summer. Such a youth as you describe, whose son soever he were, would be a kind of treasure in our solitude. We can promise him sufficient shelter from the elements, the healthiest air, rest, liberty, and the feeling of friends. To the Painter scarcely anything out of Chaos could be more unpicturesque than our environment; nothing but the everlasting desolation of the Moors and Mountains, with black Galloway Beeves<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A black hornless breed of cattle.</note> and red Galloway Drovers: nevertheless this too, as I often say, is a part of God&#x2019;s Creation, and has its significance; to your Son it will be all of the strangest, and at that age whatsoever is new has charm enough. I fancy he may spend his vacation rather pleasantly with us; and both profit us and himself. In regard to health, as already hinted, Craigenputtoch ranks high; has proved its superiority and supremacy on all that have resided there,&#x2014;except the Master and Mistress, who indeed I suppose are incurables. Let the matter then so far as our vote can go be considered as settled. Perhaps if our young Friend were to join us <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and, after looking at Edinburgh, go home <hi rend="italic">with</hi> us, it might be the smoothest method for him. But whatever way you find most suitable will of itself suit us; and by an exchange of Letters the whole can quite easily be arranged.</p>
<p>Jeffrey expresses himself highly content with you. He is, as you have read on his countenance and manner, a thoroughly good-hearted man; ready at all times to do good, were it only as a pleasant kind of luxury. In a character wholly <hi rend="italic">sceptical</hi> I have never elsewhere seen so much beneficence, affectionateness, perennial <hi rend="italic">belief</hi>&#x2014;in the best of all creeds. &#x201C;Nature will return, tho&#x2019; you drive her out with pitchforks.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles,</hi> I, x, 24. See Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH,</hi> XLV, 450, for Hunt&#x2019;s description of his meeting with Jeffrey on <date when="1833-03-08">8 March</date>.</note></p>
<p>Many thanks for your defence of me. But the Advocate too has reason to call me &#x201C;austere&#x201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt had defended Carlyle by saying &#x201C;that if you were austere, it was like the austere rind of a fruit round a heart of sweetness&#x201D; (Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH,</hi> XLV, 451).</note> one has to &#x201C;set his face like a flint&#x201D; against so many things in this world: neither can any Lord find it very sweet that you (in spite of yourself) strip him of his Lordship, and meet him as a naked son of Adam, better than yourself or worse. I believe, in truth, no Lord alive can stand this better than his Lord-Advocateship: but with him too it is a kind of trial.</p>
<p>Few men have such a passion as I for old Newspapers; especially in the Moorlands. We read the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> weekly and a <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> (the insipidest of <hi rend="italic">Swim-with-the-streams</hi>); and except by the bounty of friends, hear in general no other news whatever. An occasional <hi rend="italic">True Sun,</hi> addressed in a friend&#x2019;s hand would be a pleasant little business.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt had offered to send it to Carlyle (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330501-TC-JHLH-01"><sic>6:375</sic><corr>TC to JHLH, <date when="1833-05-01">1 May 1833</date></corr></ref>).</note> Unfortunately however we have only two posts in the week: Wednesday (your London Monday): and Saturday (your Thursday).&#x2014; Cobbett, as you say, does hit the nail on the head. &#x201C;Gentlemen you <supplied>[can]</supplied> make what pretty Laws you like, and produce bursts of parliamentary eloquence till your tongues weary: but the melancholy fact is, the people cannot get any victuals, and cannot (and also will not) do without some.&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Since <date when="1833-01-00">January</date> Cobbett had given a series of speeches in defence of the poor in debates on the Irish Disturbances Bill and Taxation. Hunt had commented on them: &#x201C;very provoking, about &#x2018;rich &#x26; poor&#x2019;&#x201D; (Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH,</hi> XLV, 451&#x2013;52). Carlyle&#x2019;s quotation, not from any of Cobbett&#x2019;s speeches, is presumably his own expression of what Cobbett might have said to Parliament. &#x201C;Bursts of parliamentary eloquence&#x201D; became a favorite phrase (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330321-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:350</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-03-21">21 March</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330418-TC-JSM-01"><sic>372</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-04-18">18 April</date></corr></ref>).</note> This is the grand soul of all the innumerable Revolutions going on now over all Europe; I calculate that it may be a century or two before there come any end to them. Alas, they tend whither no Whig Premier dare whisper to himself even in dreams.</p>
<p>And now for the present <foreign>adieu</foreign>. You will write to us soon; and also if it be possible, <hi rend="italic">long</hi>. When the grand Expedition is once adjusted, no doubt we shall have timely warning. Meanwhile, all good be with you and yours. &#x201C;Stout heart to <hi rend="italic">stay <foreign>brae</foreign></hi> (steep hill),&#x201D; as our Scottish adage says; and despair of nothing!</p>

<salute>My Dear Mrs. Austin,</salute>
<p>A hurried word is all I can send you in return for your kind, good letter, which spoke to us, as all your letters do, like the voice of a Friend. Many things remind us of you; to my Wife I believe you are literally the best of all womankind; neither for me is there any figure in that huge city whom I can remember with purer satisfaction. This, if it be a comfort to you in your brave life-fight, is a quite genuine one. Continue to bear yourself like a brave, true woman, and know always that friendly eyes and hearts are upon you. On my own side, too, I will say that the interest you take in my poor, small and so sorely hampered toils is a great encouragement, a great increase of strength to me. It is something surely that the words out of my heart speak sometimes into such a heart, and find response there; that you find them not utterly vain, and my little Life a kind of Reality and no Chimaera. Could I one day so much as resemble that Portrait you possess of me, and persist in calling like! But alas! alas! However we will be content; <foreign><hi rend="italic">alle Frauen</hi></foreign>, says Jean Paul, <foreign><hi rend="italic">sind geborne Dichterinnen</hi></foreign> [all Women are born Poetesses],<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> bless them for it, most of all when their art comes our own way!</p>
<p>Your Falk, which has long been expected, will prove a most welcome present; the extracts I see in the Newspapers whet my curiosity. I might have had the original in Edinburgh; but waited for your English with the Notes.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Characteristics of Goethe. From the German of Falk, von M&#xfc;ller, &#x26;c. with notes, original and translated, illustrative of German Literature, by Sarah Austin</hi>, 3 vols.

<p>We have heard often of your purpose to leave England, a thing sad to think of, to hear confirmed as near at hand.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had reported on <date when="1833-05-18">18 May</date> that &#x201C;the Austins are still bent upon going to live in Germany after the conclusion of his present Course of Lectures&#x201D; (Mineka, XII, 156). They were thinking of returning to Bonn where John Austin had studied for six months in <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">28</date>. As Sarah Austin had explained to Victor Cousin, <date when="1833-04-02">2 April</date>, &#x201C;People all exclaim and regret, and are <foreign><hi rend="italic">au d&#xE9;sespoir</hi></foreign>, and I am quite &#x2018;the fashion&#x2019;&#x2014;but that will not enable us to live&#x201D; (Ross, I, 73&#x2013;74).</note> Yet how shall one gainsay it? Your view of the case is most probably just and accurate; your resolution on it the best. Let us not add lead to the bravely buoyant; rather than think of you as lost, I will lay schemes how we may cross the Channel ourselves, and pass some winter beside you! Were that not a scheme? After all, more unlikely things have come to pass.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Austin replied, on <date when="1833-07-01">1 July</date>, &#x201C;If you were really to come to us it would go far to console us for what else we had left.&#x201D;</note> We shall see; we shall hope, and to the last keep hoping. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Der Mensch</hi></foreign>, says F. Schlegel almost pathetically, <foreign><hi rend="italic">in dieser Erde ist eigentlich auf Hoffnung gestellt</hi></foreign> [man on this Earth is essentially inclined to Hope];<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> this is called the Place of Hope.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301010-TC-MAC-01"><sic>5:171</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1830-10-10">10 Oct. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> Will you then, in that case, undertake to &#x201C;do the hoping&#x201D; for us all?</p>
<p>My own course is utterly dubious at this moment; the signs of the times are quite despicable in England, nothing but a hollow, barren, jarring of Radicalism and Toryism for unmeasured periods, likely enough to issue in confusion and broken crowns; in which struggle I as one feel hitherto no call to spend or be spent.

Alas for it! it is a sick disjointed time; neither shall we ever mend it; at best let us hope to mend ourselves. I declare I sometimes think of throwing down the Pen altogether as a worthless weapon; and leading out a Colony of these poor starving Drudges to the waste places of their old Mother Earth, when for the sweat of their brow bread <hi rend="italic">will</hi> rise for them; it were perhaps the worthiest service that at this moment could be rendered our old world to throw open for it the doors of the New.

<salute>My Dear Mrs. Austin,</salute>
<p>Your three beautiful Volumes<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of her <hi rend="italic">Characteristics of Goethe</hi>.</note> were here sooner by your conveyance than they could have been by mine. We have all read them, with pleasure, with eagerness; for me, I could not skip even what I knew in German already, but must have it taste for me a second time in your fine clear-flowing English.</p>
<p>A Book more honestly put together I have not met with for many years. A discreet gentle feminine tone runs through it, with quiet lookings nevertheless into much, much that lies beyond the English horizon; no compromise with error, yet no over-loud assertion of the truth; unwearied inquiry, faithful elaboration; in a word, the thing <hi rend="italic">done</hi> that is pretended to be done: what other praise could I wish to give you?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had written to Carlyle (<date when="1833-07-01">1 July</date>): &#x201C;That you &#x26; my other dear friend will judge it indulgently &#x26; kindly, I know full well. I do not feel entitled to any very large share of approbation &#x26; shall therefore be contented &#x26; thankful for such a portion as you can in sincerity bestow.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>I perceive that Falk has been the root or nucleus of the whole, yet so much better than Falk have you made it, I almost regret you had not left him out altogether: a dull <hi rend="italic">undiaphanous,</hi> semi-diaphanous kind of man; one cannot see Goethe through him, only see a <hi rend="italic">huge singularity</hi>. Some of the speeches, especially that about Schulze,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ernst Schulze (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>), romantic poet, author of <hi rend="italic">C&#xE4;cilie</hi> (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1819-00-00">19</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Die Bezauberte Rose</hi> (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>). Carlyle refers to part of Falk&#x2019;s memoirs where Goethe is reported as having said of Schulze&#x2019;s early death: &#x201C;One ought to take care &#x2026; to cover one&#x2019;s self as quickly as possible with fame, and as slowly as possible with earth&#x201D; (I, 127). In her note on this section Sarah Austin points out that Goethe &#x201C;might be expected to view with some impatience the intensely subjective scheme of Schulze&#x2019;s poems.&#x201D; (I, 321).</note> I must endeavour to consider as mis-reported not a little. However, you, with your appendages and fringings, have done wonders, and actually almost (with such a deft, assiduous needle) <hi rend="italic">worked</hi> a silk-purse out of what the Proverb says will never make one. Had but a Boswell stood in Falk&#x2019;s shoes, there had been a task worthy of you!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> (<date when="1833-06-02">2 June 1833</date>) felt: &#x201C;Falk&#x2019;s part is full of interest. &#x2026; It is well for us that Goethe had a friend in whose ear these jewels were treasured.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Leaving Falk (which was worth turning into English, too), I find nothing else that is not instructive, much that is gracefully so; of your doing, nothing, as I said, that is not well done. You have fairly and clearly (and in your case almost heroically) stated the <hi rend="italic">true</hi> principle of Translation;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had explained in the preface (p.xxxvi) that she had aimed at catching &#x201C;the idiomatic tone of the author,&#x201D; and placing &#x201C;him before the reader with his national and individual peculiarities of thought and of speech.&#x201D;</note> and what is more, acted on it; I hear the fine silver music of Goethe sound through <hi rend="italic">your</hi> voice, through your heart; you can <hi rend="italic">actually translate Goethe</hi>, which (quietly, I reckon) is what hardly three people in England can. And so let me heartily wish you all manner of success; and scientifically <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> you as much as in these strange days almost any Book merely artistic in character can hope for.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Austin had asked (<date when="1833-07-01">1 July</date>) for Carlyle&#x2019;s help in promoting the book, fearing that it would not be &#x201C;popular&#x201D; because she did not &#x201C;tear away every rag from the life of a great man&#x2014;to make &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">revelations</hi>.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> Finally, I said several times in words, and here again say in ink, that you may find a higher task one day, than Translating; though I praise and honour you much for adhering to that as you now stand, and keeping far from you all ambition, but the highest, that of living faithfully. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Das weitere wird sich geben</hi></foreign> [The rest will follow]. Stand by that; there is nothing else will abide any wearing, let the voice of the Reviewer be high or low, and millions of caps or none at all leap into the air at your name.</p>
<p>I have very little time this evening; and no business to devote so much of it even to you; but the Pen must on. We shall eagerly expect news within these three weeks; Jane says, the Letter is to be <hi rend="italic">hers</hi>.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Austin (<date when="1833-07-01">1 July</date>) had written, &#x201C;I shall soon write to my friend at your elbow.&#x201D;</note> She farther declares, with that promptitude which so well beseems the female intellect, that you ought to come <hi rend="italic">hither!</hi> There is an excellent house and garden to be let (for almost nothing) within few miles of us; and no cheaper country can be found in the whole world. Then there is such abundant room in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> house of ours; and it were so easy for you to come and investigate the whole matter and see us to boot. In this latter part of the proposition, I too must heartily give assent and encouragement; it is all literally true about the <hi rend="italic">room</hi>; about the welcome there is still less doubt; and then the journey were no unpleasant thing; the rather if you held John Mill to his word, who has as good as promised to see us here this autumn.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330718-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:412</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-07-18">18 July 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> After all, what if you should really take thought of it?</p>
<p>In the meantime, again accept my thanks and friendliest wishes; may all Good be with you and Lucykin and the heart to conquer all Evil!</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am very sorry that all my &#x2018;Paperbags&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An allusion to <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 1:61), the MS of which Dilke had from ca. <date when="1831-12-20">20 Dec.</date> to <date when="1832-01-08">8 Jan. 1832</date>.</note> lie at Craigenputtoch, and there is hardly anything recoverable here that can do you the slightest service.</p>
<p>By great searching I have found you two scraps; to either of which you are heartily welcome (for I think you want but one): the first (<hi rend="italic">Faust&#x2019;s Curse</hi>) is a literal Translation from the German Play, and has never been put in types before: of the second (<hi rend="italic">the Beetle,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact TC&#x2019;s trans. of Goethe&#x2019;s &#x201C;Faust&#x2019;s Curse&#x201D; had been pbd. in Ottilie von Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi> in <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date> (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300831-TC-G-01"><sic>5:156</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1830-08-31">31 Aug. 1830</date></corr></ref>), and &#x201C;The Beetle&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 3 (<date when="1831-02-00">Feb. 1831</date>): 72.</note> which is my own) I dare not certify so much; for my Brother, I think, did give a copy of it to some Magazine some year and half ago,&#x2014;where doubtless it hung suspended for a moment like &#x2018;snowflake on the river&#x2019;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.
