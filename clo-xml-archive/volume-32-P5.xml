<p>This volume includes letters from <date when="1856-10">October 1856</date> to the end of <date when="1857-07">July 1857</date> and covers a period of major events: in the Carlyles&#x2019; personal lives (particularly the death of Lady Ashburton), in Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s life as a writer (the preparation of the first edition of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and the preparation of the first collected edition of his works), and in the world of politics and international affairs, with the bombardment of Canton, the dissolution of Parliament, and the &#x201C;Indian Mutiny.&#x201D; The volume also includes two appendices: the first traces the history of the publication of the cheap edition of TC&#x2019;s works through advertisements that appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> <date when="1856-07">1856</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-07">58</date>; the second gives transcriptions of TC&#x2019;s marginalia on a copy of Elizabeth Barrett Browning&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh</hi>. Of the 168 letters, 132 are from TC and 36 from Jane Welsh Carlyle.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1. Ten (28%) of the letters by JWC in this vol., and 84 (68%) of TC&#x2019;s, are previously unpbd. Eleven (31%) of JWC&#x2019;s letters and only 14 (10%) of TC&#x2019;s are previously pbd. in part. That the greater proportion of JWC&#x2019;s letters is previously pbd., in whole or in part, is largely because TC collected them in preparation for publication after her death. Nineteen of her letters in this volume were pbd. either by Froude in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> or Alexander Carlyle in <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi>; several have annotations and comments by TC. Of the remainder of TC&#x2019;s letters, 6% are quoted, 3% are pbd. in collections, 14% pbd. elsewhere, and 3% are noted from sale catalogues. Of the remainder of JWC&#x2019;s letters, 19% are quoted, 11% pbd. in collections, and 11% pbd. elsewhere.</note> That we have fewer letters by JWC is nothing new and is partly explained by the fact that fewer of them have survived.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For example, it is clear from Jess Donaldson&#x2019;s letter to JWC, [<date when="1857-07-03">3 July</date>? <date when="1857">1857</date>], that JWC wrote regularly to the Donaldsons in Haddington. Apparently none of these letters survived.</note> However, several of her letters in this volume are particularly long, especially those to Mary Russell, her own and her mother&#x2019;s old Thornhill friend.</p>
<p>The volume opens with the Carlyles at the end of a two-and-a-half month holiday in Scotland, much of which they spent apart. Their meeting at Scotsbrig, <date when="1856-10-01">1 October</date>, was hardly an affectionate reunion, and their journey back to Chelsea together, <date when="1856-10-04">4 October</date>, was also fraught. JWC told Mary Russell that TC arrived at Scotsbrig, &#x201C;in what the people here call rsquo;a state of mind,&#x2019;&#x201D; and that she wished he had gone back to London with Lady Ashburton in the Ashburtons&#x2019; railway carriage rather than accompany her, to whom &#x201C;Providence&#x201D; would have been a more agreeable protector (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18561006-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR [<date when="1856-10-06">6 Oct. 1856</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>The time in Scotland, for both of them, had been a poignant journey through the emotional and physical landscapes of their past. TC had been <pb id="pg-32-xii" n="32:xii"/>moved to tears by the sight of family graves at Ecclefechan and spent much time riding and exploring places of his youth. He, more than JWC, noticed and disliked the changes in the economy and the landscape, as he reported to his brother Alick in Canada: &#x201C;Everything is now changed and changing with furious rapidity in this country,&#x2014;principally owing to the railways I think. A great increase of luxury is coming over all ranks; &#x2026; Jamie says, <hi rend="italic">porridge</hi> will be out of use altogether in 20 years.&#x2014;I cannot say I love these aspects of things&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18561003-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1856-10-03">3 Oct. 1856</date></ref>). By the end of their stay, TC could not wait to get back to Chelsea: &#x201C;[T]he day after tomorrow, we hope, if all go right, to reach Chelsea again, and get to something more profitable than touring&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18561002-TC-KE-01">TC to [KE?], <date when="1856-10-02">2 Oct. 1856</date></ref>).</p>
<p>As soon as they arrived TC was immediately back at work, while JWC continued to be deeply affected by Scotland. Much of the Scottish focus of this volume comes through her. Her regular correspondence with Mary Russell became more frequent. She wrote three long, affectionate letters in <date when="1856-10">October</date> alone, and more than a third of her letters overall are to Mary Russell. Her attachment to Scotland, with some reservations about the weather, is clear: &#x201C;Scotland&#x2014;dear dear Scotland! I could have found in my heart to lie down and take the ground in my arms, and kiss it, that morning I came away.&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Only it was raining torrents!</hi>&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18561006-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1856-10-06">6 Oct. 1856</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>JWC&#x2019;s letters to Mary Russell are full of references to past acquaintances and events in Scotland. It is the place where her health improved. It was there that she could achieve the happiness and tranquility recommended by her London doctor long before (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18561010-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1856-10-10">10 Oct. 1856</date></ref>). She returned to Scotland in <date when="1857-07">July 1857</date> with the hope of once more gaining strength after a long illness. Although she was disappointed that her health did not improve as quickly as she expected and her morbid thoughts were not all dispelled, Scotland, friends associated with her childhood and youth seem to have become more real to her than Chelsea. While staying with the Donaldsons, she wrote: &#x201C;[L]ife here is as good for me as any life could be&#x2014;tho most people would wonde[r w]here the charm lay which [makes] me all day long as content as I can ever hope to be in this world&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570712-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-07-12">12 July 1857</date>]</ref>). Where in the past she had discouraged TC&#x2019;s searches for a home in Scotland (<ref target="volume-25/lt-18501218-TC-JCA-01"><sic>25:309&#x2013;10</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1850-12-18">18 Dec. 1850</date></corr></ref>), here she even recommends that they take lodgings in Aberlady: &#x201C;I am sure I could make you comfortable there&#x2014;and should feel <foreign><hi rend="italic">heimlich</hi></foreign> [cosy] myself&#x201D; [<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570712-JWC-TC-01"><date when="1857-07-12">12 July 1857</date></ref>]. She then wrote from Haddington: &#x201C;No where in the world that I know of are there such beautiful drives! and I recognise places that I had <hi rend="italic">seen in my dreams!</hi>&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570714-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1857-07-14">14 July 1857</date></ref>).</p>
<p>From <date when="1856-10">October 1856</date> onward, back in Chelsea, their lives were dominated by <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, by preparations for the cheap edition of TC&#x2019;s works, and by JWC&#x2019;s health. As soon as she arrived in Cheyne Row she became ill and blamed TC for making her sit in &#x201C;a violent draught all the journey.&#x201D; She painted a scene for <pb id="pg-32-xiii" n="32:xiii"/>Mary Russell of absolute misery: London fog, air like &#x201C;liquid soot,&#x201D; TC at breakfast, sitting at one end of the table, looking &#x201C;bilious,&#x201D; and she at the other, looking &#x201C;half-dead.&#x201D; Yet the vigor with which she described her condition, TC&#x2019;s irritation, and the infestation of bugs that greeted their arrival in Cheyne Row (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18561010-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1856-10-10">10 Oct. 1856</date>]</ref>) is meant to make the reader feel her despair through a veil of amusement. The letter is an entertainment as much as anything else.</p>
<p>Throughout the winter, JWC&#x2019;s illness caused her lengthy bouts of insomnia, confined her to the house and, frequently, to her bed, leaving her weak and dispirited by the time summer <date when="1857">1857</date> came. Yet, in spite of her illness and low spirits, JWC never lost her fascination for her friends. She was still desirable company for Ellen Twisleton, who wrote to her sister, probably at the end of October, complaining of London parties where no one knew anyone else because the parties were &#x201C;a perpetual entrance and exit. &#x2026; [I]t is so impossible to make any mark on such a sea that there is no temptation to try&#x201D;; she was refusing all engagements except with the Carlyles (Houghton 45M-98). Although no cup bearer to JWC, Twisleton&#x2019;s comments about her show the strength of JWC&#x2019;s ability to excite loyalty and affection in independent and intelligent younger women (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561215-JWC-EDW-01">JWC to <sic>ED</sic><corr>EDW</corr>, <date when="1856-12-15">15 Dec. 1856</date></ref>). Jewsbury, who sat sewing beside her (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561006-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1856-10-06">[6 Oct.] 1856</date></ref>), was concerned about her health too, but JWC was much less gracious toward her, complaining about her constant presence and insensitivity in the face of illness to Mary Russell and to Twisleton (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561128-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1856-11-28">[28 Nov.] 1856</date></ref>). But Jewsbury was an older friend with whom she had a many-layered relationship.</p>
<p>At the end of <date when="1856-10">October 1856</date> Henry Larkin entered their lives. He had corresponded with TC for some years and was an admirer but not an acolyte. He offered TC his help in <date when="1856">1856</date> and was a frequent visitor at Cheyne Row. Writing in <date when="1881">1881</date>, ostensibly to straighten the record after the publication of <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, he gave a picturesque description of what JWC was like during the period of this volume.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Larkin, &#x201C;Carlyle and Mrs. Carlyle: a Ten-Years&#x2019; Reminiscence,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">British Quarterly Review</hi> 74 (<date when="1881">1881</date>): 28&#x2013;84.</note> He called her TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;queenly wife&#x201D;; on their first meeting, she greeted him kindly and &#x201C;looked ill, and yet there was evidently something more depressing than mere bodily suffering&#x201D; (32). However Larkin also described JWC&#x2019;s ability to charm. He was summoned to Cheyne Row in <date when="1857-02">mid-February 1857</date> (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570204-TC-HL-01">TC to HL, <date when="1857-02-04">4 Feb. 1857</date></ref>), when, to his delight, JWC&#x2019;s health had improved:</p>
<p>She had been very kind before; but with a patiently hopeless look, like a mourner by an unclosed grave. But all this had now passed away. &#x2026; [H]er face was illuminated with the brightest of welcomes. I never knew any one who could deal out little flatteries so pleasantly and judiciously. I <pb id="pg-32-xiv" n="32:xiv"/>have seen it administered by the spoonful &#x2026; ; and even laid on &#x2026; with a plasterer&#x2019;s trowel. But she knew better. She knew the sensitive points exactly; and if she choose, could touch them so delicately, that it almost seemed like a happy inadvertence; and she could also prick them with the deftest of needles, if she saw fit. (36&#x2013;37)</p>
<p>By this time TC was deep in preparing new editions of his works for publication by Chapman &#x26; Hall. Larkin&#x2019;s work was mainly helping TC with corrections for this edition.</p>
<p>TC&#x2019;s ability to draw younger people to him was still evident during this period. Alexander Gilchrist had moved next door in order to be able to help him (see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560902-TC-AGI-01"><sic><sic>31:206</sic><corr>31:207</corr></sic><corr>TC to AGI, <date when="1856-09-02">2 Sept. 1865</date></corr></ref>) and did so until his brother died in <date when="1856-11">November 1856</date> (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561207-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1856-12-07">7 Dec. 1856</date></ref>). Vernon Lushington, another young admirer, volunteered his help and worked with TC consistently throughout the publication of the cheap editions. In <date when="1857-06">June 1857</date> Turgenev visited him, then wrote to a friend describing TC&#x2019;s curiosity about Russia and &#x201C;his courage and originality.&#x201D; He did not agree with TC but obviously enjoyed his evening with him and JWC, saying that they were both &#x201C;likeable and good soul<supplied>[s]</supplied>&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570604-TC-HT-01">TC to HT, <date when="1857-06-04">4 June 1857</date></ref>).</p>
<p>Neuberg continued to work on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, along with the unfortunate Frederick Martin, who stole from TC and became a byword among the Carlyles&#x2019; acquaintances for everything irritating. According to Espinasse, TC and Martin complained about each other. Martin was apparently paid very little and, out of that, was expected to pay his own fares when he went off to do research for TC (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561015-TC-FEMA-01">TC to <sic>FM</sic><corr>FEMA</corr>, <date when="1856-10-15">15 Oct. 1856</date></ref>). TC&#x2019;s attitude to Neuberg can still surprise; he gave Neuberg no acknowledgment and was crudely insulting behind his back, calling him &#x201C;the Beauty&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570727-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1857-07-27">27 July 1857</date>]</ref>), a sarcastic reference to what the Carlyles considered to be his extreme ugliness (see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:218</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-04-25">25 April 1856</date></corr></ref>). To John Carlyle, he wrote that Neuberg &#x201C;can attend to nothing but the sorrowful cares and gloomy confusions that now devolve on him&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18561102-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1856-11-02">2 Nov. 1856</date></ref>). This was not true. Neuberg&#x2019;s brother-in-law was dying, yet Neuberg stayed working on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> throughout, helped TC find a suitable horse, and ordered paper for him. In his letter to Neuberg, <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561029-TC-JN-01"><date when="1856-10-29">29 October 1856</date></ref>, TC told him not to forget the ream of paper (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561029-TC-JN-01"><sic>21&#x2013;22</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1856-10-29">29 Oct. 1856</date></corr></ref>) and, on <date when="1857-05-18">18 May 1857</date>, Neuberg wrote at the beginning of his letter answering queries on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>: &#x201C;If you do not receive <hi rend="italic">today</hi> a packet of Note-paper from Parkins &#x26; Gotto, please to let me know.&#x201D; TC wrote 15 letters to Neuberg during this period, all concerned with <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>.</p>
<p>The publication of the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> as a series that could be collected into a complete <hi rend="italic">Collected Works</hi> was clearly to do with Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s marketing strategy (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561205-TC-VL-01">TC to VL, <date when="1856-12-05">5 Dec. 1856</date></ref>), but it meant a tremendous amount of work for TC, in spite of the help he was receiving. Of the letters he wrote <pb id="pg-32-xv" n="32:xv"/>during this period, more than a third were to Chapman &#x26; Hall, Lushington, Larkin, and Neuberg. All his letters to them were concerned with the publication of either the cheap edition of the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> or his new work <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>. Most of his letters to his family and friends mentioned the continuous grind of preparation and proofreading. With JWC ill, Lady Ashburton abroad and ill, and the burden of his work, what comes across frequently in his letters is a feeling of isolation and disengagement. He relaxed by taking long rides on his horse Fritz, bought in <date when="1856-11">November 1856</date>. He often rode alone but was sometimes accompanied by, among others, Monckton Milnes, Robert Farie, or, after Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s death, Lord Ashburton.</p>
<p>The death of Lady Ashburton was a major event in both the Carlyles&#x2019; lives. JWC was not unmoved by it, and this is shown in her letters. But it also made it possible for a change in the Carlyles&#x2019; relationship, again shown in the letters, particularly those that JWC wrote to TC while she was in Scotland in <date when="1857-07">July 1857</date>. They have none of the edge of the letters of summer <date when="1856">1856</date> when the Carlyles were apart. They are more open, often more dependant, and more openly depressed than the previous summer&#x2019;s. The relationship is closer, TC is once more her best friend, &#x201C;It is certainly a questionable privilege one&#x2019;s best friend enjoys: that of having all one&#x2019;s darkness rayed out on him! &#x2026; to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I cannot for my life be anything but a bore!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570723-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1857-07-23">[23 July] 1857</date></ref>). TC&#x2019;s responses were affectionate, as if to a frightened and sick child, telling her not to worry about expense or him, reassuring her about Nero and the canaries, and telling her that when <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> was finished they would be more to each other than they had ever been, finishing the letter: &#x201C;Whom else have I in the world?&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570709-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1857-07-09">9 July 1857</date></ref>).</p>
<p>Although Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s death was presumably something of a relief for JWC, for TC it was the loss of a great friend. He told Neuberg that he had &#x201C;had no such blow for a long while&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570507-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1857-05-07">7 May 1857</date></ref>). The depth of his sadness confused him; he found it difficult to remember the day of the funeral although he went to it on Tuesday, <date when="1857-05-12">12 May 1857</date>. He told his brother it was on Monday (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570522-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1857-05-22">22 May 1857</date></ref>); in his journal, 11 May, he wrote that it was on Sunday, calling Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s death a &#x201C;great and irreparable sorrow to me&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570511-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1857-05-11">11 May 1857</date></ref>; Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:186). Although he mentioned his grief only briefly in his letters and never stopped working, it is clear that however close his relationships with others, for TC there was never to be another friendship to take its place. For him it was the end of an era.</p>
<p>There are two interesting additions to the main content of letters in this volume: TC&#x2019;s close reading and marginal comments on two newly published books. The first was Hugh Miller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Testimony of the Rocks</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1857">1857</date>), sent to him by Miller&#x2019;s widow, Lydia. TC liked Miller and was interested in his geology but found his creationist theories irrelevant. The reading of Miller&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-32-xvi" n="32:xvi"/>book, his comments on it, and his instruction to his nephew James Aitken (to whom he gave it) to take care of it were clearly pious acts in memory of a man who had taken his own life (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570415-TC-LMI-01">TC to LM, <date when="1857-04-15">15 April 1857</date></ref>). The second was Elizabeth Barrett Browning&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh</hi>. TC&#x2019;s comments on this book were a good deal less pious. He was no lover of poetry, and his comments were, in the main, dismissive. However, in view of the influence TC had on Barrett Browning in general and <hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh</hi> in particular, they provide an interesting addendum to knowledge of TC&#x2019;s views on Barrett Browning&#x2019;s poetry (see <ref target="volume-32/ed-32-comments-on-aurora-leigh"><sic>appendix 2</sic><corr>TC&#x2019;s Comments on Aurora Leigh</corr></ref>).</p>
<p>The background to this volume of the letters is one of great political and international turmoil, with which, at this period, the Carlyles made very little engagement. Their comments on political events were, in the main, not analytical. The <hi rend="italic">Arrow</hi> affair (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570305-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1857-03-05">5 March 1857</date></ref>) and the subsequent bombardment of Canton (which brought down the government and started a war that lasted nearly four years) were not mentioned in the letters. TC told his sister Jean that he could not &#x201C;pretend to care one farthing&#x201D; about the resulting general election. News of the rebellion in India, <date when="1857-05-10">10 May 1857</date>, reached London at the end of June and was first reported in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1857-06-27">27 June 1857</date>. TC&#x2019;s first mention of it in his letters was in TC to JWC, <date when="1857-07-13">13 July 1857</date>, the same day the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported that it was more than a local disturbance. Even the news of the massacres, received toward the end of July, was only mentioned in passing between writing about Nero and his page proofs (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570725-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1857-07-25">25 July 1857</date>]</ref>). JWC was more interested in morbidly reading pamphlets containing the love letters and trial in Edinburgh of Madeleine Smith, who had allegedly poisoned her lover (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570726-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-07-26">26 July 1857</date>]</ref>), than she was in world events. It was not until she wrote of her meeting with Col. Hamilton Veitch that there was any mention of India: &#x201C;He [Veitch] had just read the Indian news and said People generally would think it bad, rsquo;because Delhi was not <hi rend="italic">already</hi>taken and the mutineers <hi rend="italic">already</hi> put down&#x2014;The English being so conceited that they always thought they had nothing to do but walk up to a thing and it would fly before them&#x2014;&#x2019; But those who knew the country, he said would only be too thankful that Bombay and Madrass were still quiet&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570730-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-07-30">30 July 1857</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>The Carlyles&#x2019; lives were more circumscribed than previously during a large part of this period. TC was even unwilling to become involved in the National Portrait Gallery (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570309-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1857-03-09">9 March 1857</date></ref>) or the choice of a replacement for William Bodham Donne at the London Library (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570321-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1857-03-21">21 March 1857</date></ref>). The burden of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and the cheap edition seemed almost too much for him. It is surprising that he should have compounded the suffocating load of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> by agreeing to work on the cheap edition, given that, on his own admission (see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 160), they were not in <pb id="lastpage-32-xvii" n="32:xvii"/>need of money. What remains impressive is the amount of work that went into each volume and the complexity of producing the new editions. This volume of letters also shows TC&#x2019;s infinite capacity for work and his single-mindedness, even in the face of the tragedy of Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s death.</p>
<p>JWC was ill and depressed for most of the period, and yet she still had the power to attract and to charm. Her letters to TC at the end of the volume were as open and frank about her feelings as her <date when="1855">1855</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856">56</date> journal had been (see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:195&#x2013;262</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal</corr></ref>). The death of Lady Ashburton had not lightened her heart but it had made TC her best friend once more. Interestingly she was uneasy about this. He was being as loving as he knew how, and yet his &#x201C;soothing&#x201D; note soothed her &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the wrong way of the hair</hi> somehow! Makes me feel I had been making a Baby of myself and a fractious Baby&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570726-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-07-26">26 July 1857</date>]</ref>). This period of closeness might be short-lived in the face of many more years of work on <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> but it undoubtedly shows a dramatic change from the previous year and another facet of their deeply complicated and contradictory relationship.</p>

<p><bold><date when="1856-10">October</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-12">December 1856</date></bold></p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1856-10">October</date></hi>. TC and JWC are reunited in Scotsbrig (<date when="1856-10-01">1</date>) and leave for London by train (<date when="1856-10-04">4</date>). Chapman &#x26; Hall discuss a U.S. edn. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>. A drafty train, an infestation of bed bugs, and servant troubles at Cheyne Row lead to a collapse of JWC&#x2019;s health. TC settles to work in ill humor, using Neuberg for research and engaging Frederick Martin as amanuensis (<date when="1856-10-25">25</date>). His sister Jean&#x2019;s youngest child dies. He tries out a horse with a view to purchase (<date when="1856-10-28">28</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1856-11">November</date></hi>. Neuberg, despite family troubles, continues to help TC both with research and, along with Robert Farie, the acquisition of a horse. TC writes to Scotland for saddle and bridle (<date when="1856-11-02">2</date>). JWC&#x2019;s health remains poor, and she writes to Mary Russell, longing to be back in Scotland where &#x201C;I am sure I should be well in twenty four hours after getting there&#x201D; (<date when="1856-11-05">5</date>). After much hesitation TC buys a horse (&#x201C;Fritz&#x201D;), which serves him until <date when="1863">1863</date>; unfortunately Fritz is lamed on his first outing (<date when="1856-11-18">18</date>) and has to rest after veterinary treatment. TC writes to his brother John that JWC has been confined indoors for five weeks (<date when="1856-11-19">19</date>) but her health is now slowly improving. Death of Mrs. Montagu (<date when="1856-11-10">10</date>), and of Adolph Frankau, Neuberg&#x2019;s brother-in-law (<date when="1856-11-12">12</date>). Fry the photographer applies to publish a reproduction of Cromwell&#x2019;s death-mask in TC&#x2019;s possession (<date when="1856-11-21">21</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1856-12">December</date></hi>. TC tells Emerson he cannot accept Phillips &#x26; Sampson&#x2019;s proposal for publishing a uniform edn. of <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> in the U.S. (<date when="1856-12-02">2</date>). TC acknowledges and says he will keep in mind a previous offer of help from Vernon Lushington (<date when="1856-12-05">5</date>), which he then accepts when Alexander Gilchrist&#x2019;s work on revising <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> for the cheap edn. is interrupted by the death of his brother (<date when="1856-12-06">6</date>). He also accepts help with indexing from Henry Larkin. TC replies to Delia Bacon&#x2019;s letter writing that she has a publisher for her book (<date when="1856-12-14">14</date>). Neuberg takes up new employment but continues to help TC (<date when="1856-12-19">19</date>). TC tells Lord Ashburton that Christmas this year will be a subdued affair in the house, with JWC scarcely recovered enough for company (<date when="1856-12-20">20</date>). JWC invites Craik to visit after a lapse of several years (<date when="1856-12-20">20</date>) and writes affectionately to Kate Ross apologizing for her long silence (<date when="1856-12-27">27</date>). Writing to his sister Jean (<date when="1856-12-28">28</date>), TC regrets the tragic deaths of Dr. Samuel Brown (d. <date when="1856-09-20">20 Sept.</date>) and Hugh Miller, who had committed suicide (<date when="1856-12-24">24</date>).</p>
<p><pb id="pg-32-xxviii" n="32:xxviii"/><bold><date when="1857-01">January</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-07">July 1857</date></bold></p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1857-01">January</date></hi>. The two vols. of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>, the first in the cheap edn. of TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, are pbd. <date when="1857-01-03">3</date> and <date when="1857-01-31">31 Jan.</date> TC continues to work on both <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and the cheap edn. with Frederick Martin&#x2019;s assistance and also Vernon Lushington and Henry Larkin&#x2019;s help on the cheap edn. JWC&#x2019;s health improves and she is able to leave the house (<date when="1857-01-21">21</date>). TC is constantly overjoyed with his horse. He orders presentation copies of the first vols. of his cheap edn. for his friends and relatives.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1857-02">February</date></hi>. TC, in a panic, mislays the MS of book 1 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1857-02-02">2</date>) but apparently finds it again quickly. Larkin helps him with indexes; Lewes and Neuberg are invited to dinner on <date when="1857-02-04">4 Feb.</date> (<date when="1857-02-02">2</date>). Lady Ashburton continues to be ill in Nice. JWC gets another cold (<date when="1857-02-12">12</date>). TC rides with Lord Goderich (<date when="1857-02-11">11</date>) and deals with correspondence, including new Cromwell letters (<date when="1857-02-16">16</date>). Frederick Martin &#x201C;banished&#x201D; to the British Museum or to his own house to work (<date when="1857-02-13">13</date>). Asked for a contribution to the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Album,</hi> TC sends &#x201C;The Opera.&#x201D; Visit from John Gordon, and to Lady Sandwich (<date when="1857-02-23">23</date>). TC is appointed a trustee for the new National Portrait Gallery (<date when="1857-02-28">28</date>), and vol. 1 of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> is pbd. in the cheap edn. (<date when="1857-02-28">28</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1857-03">March</date></hi>. TC invites Richard Monckton Milnes to ride (<date when="1857-03-03">3</date>); he rides almost daily for health, while JWC is run down and very unwell. <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> makes slow progress, TC feeling it is the most difficult of jobs: &#x201C;the hatefullest and most disgustingly <foreign><hi rend="italic">fashous</hi></foreign> contemptible and difficult I ever was in&#x201D; (<date when="1857-03-05">5</date>). TC congratulates Arthur Helps on vol. 3 of <hi rend="italic">The Spanish Conquest of America</hi> (<date when="1857-03-10">10</date>), dismisses Frederick Martin (<date when="1857-03-21">21</date>), attends a Portrait Gallery trustees&#x2019; meeting (<date when="1857-03-23">23</date>), and asks David Laing for another copy of &#x201C;Project of a National Exhibition of Scottish Portraits&#x201D; for the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> in the cheap edn. (<date when="1857-03-28">28</date>). The first signs of his hernia appear (TC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1857-03-29">29</date>) and cause him considerable discomfort. Palmerston calls an election (<date when="1857-03-31">31</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1857-04">April</date></hi>. Vol. 2 of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> in the cheap edn. pbd. (<date when="1857-04-04">4</date>). TC, writing to Lady Ashburton, encourages both Ashburtons to set up &#x201C;practical schools&#x201D; for boys or girls (<date when="1857-04-07">7</date>); he decides he is too busy to participate in the appointment of a new librarian at the London Lib.; he recommends Frederick Martin to a copyist&#x2019;s position at the British Museum (<date when="1857-04-08">8</date>). JWC, writing to Helena Ferme (ca. <date when="1857-04-12">12 April</date>), complains she has had only two weeks free of colds since her return from Scotland. TC thanks Lydia Miller, widow of Hugh Miller, for sending him Hugh Miller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Testimony of Rocks,</hi> in memory of her husband (<date when="1857-04-15">15</date>). TC rides &#x201C;daily, to keep myself alive till the job be done&#x201D; (<date when="1857-04-20">20</date>). Thackeray&#x2019;s daughters visit JWC (<date when="1857-04-19">19</date>). TC, strongly opposed by JWC, considers spending winter <date when="1857">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858">58</date> in Berlin. Tait&#x2019;s painting <hi rend="italic">Susannah,</hi> which includes Nero, according to JWC, is to be exhibited (<date when="1857-04-20">20</date>). TC dines with the Forsters (<date when="1857-04-29">29</date>).</p>
<p><pb id="lastpage-32-xxix" n="32:xxix"/><hi rend="italic"><date when="1857-05">May</date></hi>. JWC is still very weak. TC, learning to cope with his hernia, is wearing a support; the first two vols. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> are ready for Chapman to begin printing; Tauchnitz enquires about the possibility of an English-language edn. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> to follow their edns. of <hi rend="italic">French Revolution;</hi> TC offers them <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> (<date when="1857-05-01">1</date>).

She is buried at the Grange with TC, Brookfield, and many others present (<date when="1857-05-12">12</date>). <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> begins going to press (<date when="1857-05-11">11</date>), and TC receives &#xa3;500 from Chapman &#x26; Hall for the cheap edn. of <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> (<date when="1857-05-18">18</date>). TC returns borrowed volumes to the Prussian embassy (<date when="1857-05-21">21</date>), visits Lady Sandwich and the Goderiches (<date when="1857-05-23">23</date>), and rides with Milnes (<date when="1857-05-24">24</date>). JWC, slowly recovering from a winter&#x2019;s ill-health, talks of going to Mary Russell in Scotland, but first visits Lady Downshire in Easthampstead Park (<date when="1857-05-23">23</date>&#x2013;ca. <date when="1857-05-26">26</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1857-06">June</date></hi>. TC, buried in work, is irritating JWC, who wants to go on holiday, but Anne is proving &#x201C;a capital servant&#x201D; (<date when="1857-06-05">5</date>). <hi rend="italic">Lives of Schiller and Sterling</hi> pbd. in cheap edn. (<date when="1857-06-10">10</date>). JWC delays her decision about going to Scotland; she is improving the garden at Cheyne Row and &#x201C;speculates &#x2026; upon an &#x2019;Awning&#x2019; &#x2026; against the blazes of July that are coming&#x201D; (<date when="1857-05-11">11</date>); Douglas Jerrold dies; Henry Larkin researches maps for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1857-06-11">11</date>).</p>

Once there, briefly well, she relaxes, takes drives, visits old friends, walks, and attends the Episcopalian chapel with the Donaldsons (<date when="1857-07-14">14</date>). In Chelsea, Tait is taking photographs (<date when="1857-07-16">16</date>) and working on his painting <hi rend="italic">A Chelsea Interior</hi>. The weather turns hot, and TC works on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> proofs in the garden under the awning, &#x201C;almost 100 pages &#x2026; off my hands&#x201D; (<date when="1857-07-24">24</date>). JWC visits her old Haddington home (<date when="1857-07-24">24</date>). The newspapers are full of the Indian rebellion. TC sees Disraeli and his wife while out riding and calls on Lady Sandwich, who invites him to visit Addiscombe with her; Tait &#x201C;paints incessantly here, and seems to me to make no progress at all&#x201D;; he had &#x201C;brought back his malodorous Photographing Apparatus&#x201D; (<date when="1857-07-26">26</date>). JWC visits her aunts in Morningside, Edinburgh, and sees her old nurse, Betty Braid, and other friends (<date when="1857-07-27">27</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-07-29">29</date>). She then crosses the Forth to her cousins at Auchtertool (<date when="1857-07-29">29</date>).

<salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>I find your letter waiting here last night; you are very obliging to remember me and the Etymology of Craigenputtoch! <hi rend="italic">Puttoch</hi> evidently signifies something of the Hawk or Glede genus; something that is despicable in comparison to an Eagle. It is an interesting fact that you have practically met the word in use at all. We will accept it in that signification; and Craig or Cliff of the <hi rend="italic">Hawks</hi> (for which sort of bird it may have been very suitable when clothed with wild birch) shall henceforth be the orthodox Translation of <hi rend="italic">Craigenputtoch,</hi>&#x2014;with thanks to the Author.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 80.</note></p>

<p>I found your letter waiting here last night. Some three months ago, a similar application was made to me on the part of Messrs. Appleton of New York;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >D.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Being here again, for a few hours, before returning to London, I think I ought to write you a word (with this bad pen, and in hurried circumstances); perhaps the <hi rend="italic">date</hi> itself will make amends for the meagre Letter.</p>
<p>In the end of <date when="1856-07">July</date>, being very feckless in point of health (mere <hi rend="italic">biliousness</hi> still, rather than anything worse), with a great spell of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> just ahead, I set off with Jane into these Northern parts, to have a little country air by way of outfit. All <date when="1856-08">August</date> I staid, perfectly silent and solitary, with Mary at The Gill; riding about, bathing when the Priestside Water<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sands on the Solway Firth; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560730-TC-JAC-01"><sic>31:144</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1856-07-30">30 July 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> served; walking a great deal in the fine twilights, on roads and lanes that were solitary, or where nobody troubled me with speech. Jane in the meanwhile was in Fife, with her Liverpool Cousins:&#x2014;one of them is a minister there, and the two girls stay with him,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. Walter, Margaret, and Mary Welsh.</note> the Father (Jane&#x2019;s worthy &#x201C;Uncle John&#x201D; whom you remember) being dead, and <hi rend="italic">Helen</hi> the eldest Cousin being also gone. I came over to Scotsbrig for a ride once or twice, rode twice into Dumfries too, and once into Annan, speaking to no soul,&#x2014;and for the rest was quite stationary, till <date when="1856-09">September</date> came. In the beginning of <date when="1856-09">September</date> I had unwillingly to take a long journey into the Highlands to visit &#x201C;the Ashburtons&#x201D; (kind English friends of mine) who were &#x201C;deer-hunting&#x201D; there.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Kinlochluichart, Dingwall; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560904-TC-LA-01"><sic>31:216</sic><corr>TC to LA, <date when="1856-09-04">4 Sept. 1856</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560912-TC-WWH-01"><sic>224</sic><corr>TC to WWH, <date when="1856-09-12">12 Sept. 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> Far away beyond Aberdeen and Inverness, amid surly black mountains, solitary crags and bogs,&#x2014;a country thrice as wild as Craigenputtoch, and otherwise of the same kind of character. To me not &#x201C;beautiful&#x201D; at all. But such things have a charm for idle English people with more money than enough! Nothing can be <hi rend="italic">madder</hi> than the doings of English grandees at present, in those Highland parts, in pursuit of deer.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Improvements in transport, changing perceptions of the Highlands (partly due to the changes in attitudes to landscape and what was &#x201C;picturesque&#x201D; brought about by the Romantics), and the passion for hunting, which had grown steadily since the <date when="1830">1830</date>s, led to the purchase of many Highland estates by wealthy English aristocrats, among them the Ashburtons, for recreation and the establishment of deer forests.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Returning from the country, I find your friendly Note, and the Copy of <hi rend="italic">M</hi>w <hi rend="italic">Robinson</hi> which it announces, all safe; and am surely much indebted to Mr Mayor and you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cooper had sent him J.

Mayor attacked TC in <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Ferrar</hi> for confusing Nicholas with his brother (xxxviii&#x2013;ix), misusing a quotation from Thomas Hearne, <hi rend="italic">Thomae Caii Vindiciae Antiquitatis Academiae Oxoniensis</hi> (<date when="1730">1730</date>) in <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:73&#x2013;74) (xxxviii), and failing to notice, although obvious from Hearne&#x2019;s book, that the &#x201C;Anonymous Person&#x201D; insulting Ferrar in a Puritan pamphlet (<date when="1641">1641</date>) was Edward Lenton of Notley (xviii&#x2013;ix). Mayor wrote of TC: &#x201C;[W]hen a man, who, though ever dinning in our ears that all around him is a moral and spiritual desert &#x2026; presumes to scoff at one whose whole life was self-denial &#x2026; it is vain to palliate his guilt by the plea, the pitiful plea, of carelessness&#x201D; (xliii&#x2013;iv). He adds in a note: &#x201C;A long and intimate acquaintance with Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s writings has, I hope, unfitted me alike for the creeping idolatry, and the fierce invective, of which he has been alternately the victim&#x201D; (xliv).</note> matter, which was intrinsically <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> on my side, you managed very well. I hope to get some good of <hi rend="italic">Robinson</hi> one of these evenings, tho&#x2019; he too seems rather a dull obsolete fellow.</p>
<p>If I come to Cambridge, certainly I will endeavour to call on you.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your situation in Wolverhampton<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably where Martin was a teaching asst. in a boys&#x2019; boarding school; it was to escape &#x201C;from a miserable existence of this kind&#x201D; that he offered his services as literary assistant to TC (Espinasse 260).</note> has evidently reached the insupportable pitch; you cannot stay longer there.</p>
<p>About ten years ago, when busied upon <hi rend="italic">Cromwell,</hi> I had a young man,&#x2014;a scholar like yourself, a graduate in Medicine, who had been cheated out of his money in this big City, and reduced to great indigence,&#x2014;who, till I ended that enterprise, was of eminent use to me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. John Christie (d. <date when="1847">1847</date>/<date when="1848-10-15">48</date>; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441025-TC-JAC-01"><sic>18:248&#x2013;49</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1844-10-25">25 Oct. 1844</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-carlyle-notebook"><sic>30:171</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1845-04-27">27 April 1845</date></corr></ref>).</note> He copied <hi rend="italic">Mss.;</hi> went to the Museum, and made investigations; did Indexing (the Index to <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> is his, one of the best I know of);&#x2014;in short, by loyalty, intelligence, fidelity, and readiness to do whatever was helpful to me, he proved well worth his pittance of wages for two years. One sovereign per week was all I could afford him. On this, with a wife and one child, he contrived (being thrifty and wise) to live comfortably, and had even furnished, in some sort, a small house for himself; and was gradually looking towards better prospects, had longer life been granted him. But he died, to my sorrow in more ways than one: and no man of equal honesty, worth and likelihood, when I have since wanted such, has ever turned up.</p>
<p>If you now like to try a similar function with me on the same terms,&#x2014;as I take it for granted you will,&#x2014;there is work enough for you in the way of helping me, with <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and many months to come; and the experiment can begin as soon as you please. We will try it for a couple of months; if you suit (as I have ground to hope), well; if not, there will be at least no harm to you, and London with its intricate capabilities lies round you as before.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neither was to like the other, but TC found Martin useful: &#x201C;He was an excellent German scholar, intelligent, even clever, and very industrious. He transcribed, translated, fetched and carried, for Carlyle, on what he described as an extremely small weekly stipend, out of which, he complained, he had to pay for writing-paper, omnibus-fares on journeys made for Carlyle. &#x2026; Carlyle, who had little pity for any grievances but his own, compared Martin, with his perpetual lamentations over himself, to the &#x2018;<foreign>peaseweep</foreign>&#x2019; of Scotland, a bird with a peculiarly wailing note&#x201D; (Espinasse 261).</note></p>
<p>Judging that you will certainly accept, and probably wish to leave Wolverh<hi rend="italic">n</hi> at once, I inclose you a Post-Office Order for &#xa3;1 (your name is &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> Martin,&#x201D; not Friedrich);&#x2014;if you wish to stay a week or two longer in W<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> <pb id="pg-32-13" n="32:13"/>you can do it: but I rather expect to see you in few days. Doubtless you will be able, Mrs M.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Martin, otherwise unidentified.</note> &#x26; you, to get some reasonable abode in this quarter, near me; but in this first instance, your last Lodging will probably be the eligiblest for you. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Quod bonum faustum felixque sit</hi></foreign> [May it turn out auspiciously and with good luck].<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18151211-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:67</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1815-12-11">11 Dec. 1815</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Here was a heavy bit of news unexpectedly awaiting me when I came down stairs tonight! Your Letter is the very image of Mother&#x2019;s Tears: woe, affection, resignation, grief without measure. Alas, alas. I myself could almost weep (tho&#x2019; long unused to it), to think of your bit bonnie Bairn that was smiling in my face last Autumn,&#x2014;like a little human flower, new-sprung on the bosom of Eternity,&#x2014;and is now cropt away on a sudden from you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean&#x2019;s son, b. <date when="1855-09">Sept. 1855</date> (see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550926-TC-JCA-01"><sic>30:75</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1855-09-26">26 Sept. 1855</date></corr></ref>); his name is not known, though he may have been called Alexander (see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551005-TC-JAC-01"><sic>30:77</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1855-10-05">5 Oct. 1855</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551204-TC-JCA-01"><sic>133</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1855-12-04">4 Dec. 1855</date></corr></ref>); he was misidentified as John at <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551005-TC-JAC-01"><sic>30:77</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1855-10-05">5 Oct. 1855</date></corr></ref> and elsewhere.

God is great, God also is good. I see you are nobly resigned to a Higher Will, as it beseems us all; and the tears you weep are soft and pious. God grant you His consolations, my dear Sister; and may this heavy stroke (as our dear Mother would have said) <hi rend="italic">be sanctified</hi> to all concerned,&#x2014;to you who feel it more than all. A Mother&#x2019;s love, a Mother&#x2019;s sorrow; there is not in this scene of things any feeling comparable to it, I believe;&#x2014;and if pious and wise, that is a blessed grief withal.&#x2014; Write me a word, so soon as you can, and tell me that your distress is getting settled into its place,&#x2014;as all things have to do in this stern world.</p>

Yet I somehow, at bottom, have felt always as if I <hi rend="italic">were</hi> considerably better. And it is certain I am getting into the very thick of my work,&#x2014;in a humour grimmer and sadder than I ever knew before. I have got a clerk (to do writing for me &#x26;c &#x26;c who answers well),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Martin began Sat., <date when="1856-10-25">25 Oct.</date></note> and this afternoon I got a Horse and tried it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Mr. Todhunter; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561028-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1856-10-28">28 Oct.</date></ref></note> These two articles and the <hi rend="italic">way</hi> I got them, one after the other, seem to me almost like monitions of Providence, and a token that I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> get my sad task accomplished.&#x2014; <closer><salute>God&#x2019;s blessing be on you, my dear Sister.

<p>Thanks for the <hi rend="italic">Albert Ms.,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably about one of the many Alberts mentioned in <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> possibly Albert the Bear (<date when="1100">1100</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1170">70</date>), 1st margrave of Brandenburg, who defeated the Wends and imposed peace in the region; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:77&#x2013;78, where TC quotes from an unidentified MS in his possession concerning Albert.</note>&#x2014;which, alas, is still in excellent time: today I have <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> a sheet again &#x26;c &#x26;c, and it will be hard work to keep my word with Time; namely to have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> when the work is done!</p>
<p>I have been twice upon the little Nag: it goes like a <hi rend="italic">saint,</hi> fidelity, composure, loyal wisdom, diligence; feet good, <hi rend="italic">head</hi> good,&#x2014;price amazingly moderate. My only fault is, It is too small in the bone; in other words, too <hi rend="italic">weak</hi> and <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> of figure to go with right emphasis. But it seems in poor condition at present; probably it will improve in a month or two.</p>
<p>I have written to Farie to see what his man can do: unless he can do something <hi rend="italic">good,</hi> we will call this a <hi rend="italic">fit,</hi> and be very thankful for it. But a good horse, tho&#x2019; it costs more at first, <hi rend="italic">eats</hi> precisely the same amount of money every week, and soon approaches to equality of price with the bad one.&#x2014; Let us see Farie first, if Mr T.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Todhunter.</note> can wait.</p>

Never mind my trivial commissions, more or less;&#x2014;a shame to intrude (even unconsciously with them) at such a crisis.&#x2014; &#x2014; The Paper has come all right: if, some time or other, you can recollect to give me the Stationer&#x2019;s Address,&#x2014;also <hi rend="italic">his</hi> of the Steel Pens,&#x2014;you shall be absolved in that particular in future.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550202-TC-JN-01"><sic>29:244&#x2013;46</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1855-02-02">2 Feb. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I enclose Farie&#x2019;s last communication about Horses. If Mr Todhunter absolutely <hi rend="italic">wants</hi> his Horse on Monday, of course I must either buy it at once, or let him have it,&#x2014;and shall be in some embarrasment<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> to choose which. But if he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> let the little creature stay with me here another week (which I cannot ask, or even <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> if there is any critical point come in regard to the disposal of the animal), my course would be clear; and the worthy little quadruped w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> certainly take no harm with me. I have been three times upon him; he seems to <hi rend="italic">mend</hi> visibly every day,&#x2014;no fault, except his lightness of structure, and a kind of stumble he sometimes has when <hi rend="italic">walking,</hi> in a fatigued or languid condition.</p>
<p>If I do not get up (on the back of him whither I am just going) so far as y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> door today to ask news (news on quite other matters than he!),&#x2014;pray let me hear <hi rend="italic">as soon</hi> as possible, and at brief intervals thenceforth.</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I want the saddle up from Scotsbrig, will you tell Isabella: saddle and Bridle,&#x2014;the Crupper is not wanted here, and can be given to Jamie for the red mare&#x2019;s use, when she comes round again from her troubles. But the saddle and bridle, some time in the course of the next eight days,&#x2014;be so good! I suppose the right railway train, to bring them up at their cheapest, and the way of rolling them together in some bit of packsheet, will not be difficult to find out.</p>
<p>My Neuberg Horse proves very decidedly <hi rend="italic">inferior</hi> to Jamie&#x2019;s, not in temper, paces, still less in <hi rend="italic">bridling</hi> (for it is perfectly bred), but in strength of bone and solidity of body;&#x2014;at least &#xa3;10 inferior, I should say, were it not for these <hi rend="italic">corny</hi> hoofs. I have got clear benefit from 5 rides upon it (4 only, but one <hi rend="italic">coming</hi>):&#x2014;tomorrow, however, I send it <hi rend="italic">back,</hi> in a dubious state of bargain (neither bought nor given up),&#x2014;till I see, for one week to come, what Farie can do, who promises great things. By one means or other I must have a horse; if not a better, then this one back: riding is going to be very indispensable to me. I also find I shall be apt to have the Horse all to myself; no partnership,&#x2014;poor Neuberg has had to give up that; and it will suit me better too perhaps. N<hi rend="italic">g</hi>&#x2019;s Brother-in-law seems to be dying; N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> can attend to nothing but the sorrowful cares and gloomy confusions that now devolve upon, and will double in that sad <hi rend="italic">event,</hi> if event it prove.</p>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Sir</hi>,</salute>
<p>There is, in the last <hi rend="italic">Fraser,</hi> a very pretty little article on America and its Kansas, &#x26;c. troubles;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;What Are the United States Coming To?&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 54 (<date when="1856-11">Nov. 1856</date>): 611&#x2013;22. The Kansas-Nebraska Act of <date when="1854">1854</date>, which stated that the people of federal territories should decide by vote whether they would enter the Union as free or slave states, was intended to heal the breach between pro- and antislavery factions in the two territories. Instead, northern abolitionists formed armed emigrant associations to populate Kansas, while advocates of slavery came in from neighboring Missouri. In May, a proslavery group wrecked the newspaper office and the hotel in Lawrence, Kansas. Reprisals followed, and until <date when="1858">1858</date> there was periodic bloodshed along the border. The article says that while America has become increasingly prosperous, its ideals have &#x201C;withered and waned&#x201D; as the recent success of proslavery factions in Kansas shows. America is &#x201C;not <hi rend="italic">one</hi> America, but <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Americas&#x2014;not a nation but a Union &#x2026; of states which divide themselves by irresistible natural affinities into two great groups. &#x2026; The north eastern colonies &#x2026; peopled mainly by the descendants of God-fearing, intelligent, industrious men who had gone hither &#x2018;for conscience sake,&#x2019; and &#x2026; the love of constitutional liberty&#x201D; (54:612) and the South, where the population was &#x201C;mongrel&#x201C;: &#x201C;Cavalier gentlemen, &#x2026; Cavalier vagabonds,&#x201D; refugees from Cromwell, convicts and paupers (54:613). The North, confident in its governmental institutions, the article reports, has had little interest in politics, while in the South, where the production of raw cotton and dependency on slave economy is increasing, political interest and power have also increased. There they have pursued &#x201C;relentlessly and victoriously &#x2026; their object of securing an unlimited area for the extension of slavery&#x201D; (54:616). In Kansas, the &#x201C;conduct of the South has been &#x2026; aggressive, insolent, overbearing&#x201D; (54:620). If civil war, or worse still, the domination of the North by the South is to be avoided, the people of the North must, according to the article, unite in voting for the Republican nominee for the presidency, John Charles Fremont (<date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890">90</date>), and against the Democrat, James Buchanan (<date when="1791">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868">1868</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540303-TC-CBU-01"><sic>29:37&#x2013;38</sic><corr>TC to CBU, <date when="1854-03-03">3 March 1854</date></corr></ref>) (54:620). Fremont was in fact defeated, <date when="1856-11-04">4 Nov.</date>, and Buchanan became president, <date when="1857">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861">61</date>.</note> which I recognise for the work of Mr. Bristed,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC assumed the article was by Charles Astor Bristed (<date when="1820">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874">74</date>), critic and diarist, but <hi rend="italic">Wellesley</hi> identifies the author as probably William Henry Hurlbert (<date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895">95</date>), journalist and abolitionist; imprisoned for his views in Richmond, Virginia, <date when="1861">1861</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862">62</date>.</note> a gentleman whom I have long heard with pleasure on all such subjects.

He might do a great deal of good to both countries, and gain the gratitude of all considerate men in both, by continuing and extending in all ways this fine function of International Interpreter between America and England, for which he has such capabilities. I charge you let him want for no encouragement on your part. As a mere <hi rend="italic">writer</hi> I find him very good; style perfect for his purpose. Only I wish he would give up saying &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">at</hi> the North,&#x2019; &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">at</hi> the South,&#x2019; which is a <pb id="pg-32-26" n="32:26"/>mere solecism and careless Yankeeism: no mortal would think of saying &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">at</hi> Germany,&#x2019; though he would &#x2018;at Berlin&#x2019; or the like: the prepositions <hi rend="small-caps">at</hi> and <hi rend="small-caps">in</hi>, we imagined, had long ago settled their account!&#x2014; Please submit to him also the sad case of the word &#x2018;Fillibuster&#x2019; (I think that is the current spelling): two-hundred years ago the word <hi rend="italic">Freebooter</hi> was rife among certain English naval gentlemen (whose life corresponded) in the West India Islands; the French of the same trade caught it up there (a nice synonym of <hi rend="italic">Boucanier,</hi> eater of <hi rend="italic">boucan,</hi> or dried salt flesh);&#x2014;caught it up, but made it into <hi rend="italic">Flib&#xFB;tier,</hi> written <hi rend="italic">Flibustier</hi> by the old printers, &#x26;c.;&#x2014;and from this origin have sprung the dreadful progeny of <hi rend="italic">Fillibusters, Filliblusters, Fillibustiers,</hi> and I know not what, which are oozing over into our own newspapers;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also <hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 15:182. The <hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</hi> confirms that the form &#x201C;filibuster&#x201D; began to be used about <date when="1850">1850</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854">54</date> for certain U.S. adventurers in the W. Indies and Central America, superseding &#x201C;flibustier.&#x201D;</note> and which ought to be killed wherever met with by every respectable man.</p>
<p>But all this is as nothing; mere preliminary talk, and other men&#x2019;s business, not my own. What I wished you to ask Mr. Bristed on my behoof is a ridiculous-looking question, but one I really wish to have answered, for <hi rend="italic">uses</hi> it has to me. &#x2018;Speaking to Bunkum.&#x2019; What is the indubitably right spelling, Bun<hi rend="italic">combe?</hi> or as above Bun<hi rend="italic">kum?</hi> and where is the Buncombe or Bunkum?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Bunkum,&#x201D; empty or meaningless talk, from a remark made in the <date when="1820">1820</date>s by a congressman from Buncombe County, North Carolina, Felix Walker (<date when="1753">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828">1828</date>), who had made a long and irrelevant speech that he said was not addressed to the House of Representatives but &#x201C;to Buncombe.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;I really wish to know (correct, as if on oath!); but am in no hurry about it for months to come.

<p><salute>Thanks Dearest&#x2014;</salute>a letter from somebody one loves, as dearly as I love you, is one of the greatest pleasures and consolations the Hours can bring,&#x2014;at all times;&#x2014; But when one is reduced to a passive state&#x2014;confined to the house and all that sort of thing, it is a perfect godsend!</p>
<p>If a good Angel, or good Fairy, or good Being with miraculous gifts, under any name, would appear to me at this moment and offer me a <hi rend="italic">Wish;</hi> I dont <pb id="pg-32-27" n="32:27"/>think I should have the grace to ask for <hi rend="italic">Wisdom.</hi> No, upon my honour!

<p>I am sure I should be well in twenty four hours after getting there&#x2014;but this raw coppercoloured fog is so trying to body and soul&#x2014;and it is impossible to venture out in it without catching fresh cold, and without being in the open air I cant sleep, and without sleeping I cant get rid of my cold&#x2014;and so things go on in a bad circle.

<salute>Dear Isabella,</salute>
<p>I stood much in my own light, the other week, when in some hurried moment I wrote to the Dr instead of to yourself, about the sending up of my saddle! I fancied he was still at Scotsbrig; I had not half a moment to spare,&#x2014;and thought I might kill two birds with one stone. It appears I have missed them both. Nothing of the saddle has yet showed itself in these parts.&#x2014; Neither indeed is there the least loss hitherto by the delay (for I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yet got a permanent Horse as I fancied, and am still only in quest of one): however, I do now write to yourself to send up the article so soon as convenience serves; for I am hoping <hi rend="italic">daily</hi> to be favoured with some animal to ride <pb id="pg-32-29" n="32:29"/>on, of which I have great need. I rode one for a week (about the time I wrote to John); but it proved too weak: then I tried another, and its foreleg (one of them) had something wrong: then &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;in short I am still <hi rend="italic">seeking</hi> by various diligent friends here, and have not yet <hi rend="italic">found.</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 11:9.</note></p>
<p>I am busy unusually, morning, evening &#x26; mid time of day; hardly ever was busier in my life; and not in such case for that kind of thing as would be desirable. If I can hold out, however, I shall get delivered, better or worse, from a Burden that had grown to the intolerable pitch. And that is mainly the good I expect from all this hurlyburly.</p>
<p>Poor Jane is very unwell, these three weeks and more. She has got a cold, which will not let her sleep; hardly any sleep at all to be had: which in the dim unkind weather is very hard upon her, and reduces her strength to a sad degree. I know not positively whether she is yet really any better; but I sometimes hope, of late days, that such is the case.</p>
<p>The Dr wrote from Edinburgh last, and I have lost his address;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John wrote to Isabella, <date when="1856-10-09">9 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Thomas Watt embarked last Saturday in his ship for Madras; &#x26; on Tuesday I saw him &#x26; took farewell of him at Gravesend just a few minutes before the ship sailed. I had a very good report of him from his superior officer &#x26; I think he will do well in his new work. &#x2026; I cannot yet say any thing about my movements for the winter; but I don&#x2019;t think it likely I shall have much time to spend at Scotsbrig. I shall go north in a fortnight or so to get Arthur settled in Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> and that is all I know&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> so that he is quite under a cloud to me, and I am getting ill off for news out of Annandale. I keep believing you are about your usual way,&#x2014;allowing for the winter season on the <hi rend="italic">thinner-skinned</hi> of you. I myself see nobody here; and sometimes hardly speak a word (except <hi rend="italic">officially</hi> to my poor Clerk or Writing Help)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Martin.</note> all day!

I got, three or four years ago, a pair of those Mackintosh Overalls<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., made from waterproof fabric invented in <date when="1823">1823</date> by Charles Macintosh (<date when="1766">1766</date>-<date when="1843">1843</date>).</note> (price 15/), which I wear every day, and find very comfortable: but the use of the mud-leathers is, that they keep <hi rend="italic">these clean</hi> (which poor Anne has not much time for at present), and that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are cleaned in the stable by the groom (already paid for it), and their dirt never heard of. So pray let me have them, on the terms stated above. Jane says, a stone of oatmeal (one stone, of the kind we <hi rend="italic">left</hi> last at Scotsbrig) may be added by way of lightening (pecuniarily) the carriage of the article,&#x2014;only 3/6 after all;&#x2014;and she can think of nothing farther.</p>
<p>I am enormously busy; and have, now occasionally, now at last, the feeling of getting something done,&#x2014;which is pretty much my one consolation as matters go, but it is indeed a good one. My poor Clerk<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Martin.</note> does his best; the willing mind, but not the skilful one as yet! My <hi rend="italic">horse</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To be called Fritz, after Frederick the Great. TC was full of praise for him during the 6&#xBD; years he owned him.</note> was bought by Farie; one of his chief feats: an extremely pretty and likely little gelding (15&#xBC; hands high, 5 or 6 years old); bay-colour, strong, swift, quiet (to a degree): if there be nothing wrong with him, everybody reckons him very cheap at 50 guineas (not a penny of abatement), and he may do me a power of good. Farie is very proud of his achievement.</p>
<p>Poor Jane, now in the house for about five weeks, and getting next to no sleep (waking altogether two nights aweek or so, falling into broken sleep from 3 to 6 a.m. on the others), is far far from well; but I try to flatter myself she is something <hi rend="italic">better</hi> within the last few days. She is very quiet and patient; cough is not much;&#x2014;can still <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> nearly to her old small degree.</p>

<salute>Dear Tait,</salute>
<p>It did not strike me yesterday till I was gone that perhaps you might think <hi rend="italic">I wanted</hi> the Photograph of Oliver&#x2019;s mask &#x26;c which was incidentally mentioned. This is not the case in any measure,&#x2014;the contrary rather is the case in my present hurry!

The cast was bought at Sotheby&#x2019;s, <date when="1932-06-14">14 June 1932</date>, by Hugh Mackay who presented it to Carlyle&#x2019;s House. In <date when="1870">1870</date>, TC was to acquire another, superior, cast of the death mask; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560302-TC-TWO-01"><sic>31:40</sic><corr>TC to TWO, <date when="1856-03-02">2 March</date></corr></ref>.

Thus, unless you come rather soon (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> may be hoped), the things will not be here, even for a sight, at this time.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs C. does not get better yet; is still very weak, tho&#x2019; not growing worse either. She cannot stand much talking; but is cheered by the sight of quiet friends for a few minutes.</p>

<salute>Dear Young Lady,</salute>
<p>You will find, done by me somewhere, a short Essay on Mirabeau and his Life;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Memoirs of Mirabeau,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> 26 (<date when="1837">1837</date>): 382&#x2013;439 and <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 28:403&#x2013;80.</note> but I never wrote anything specially on Napoleon.</p>
<p>On the whole, I do not much advise, at this stage of your culture, an extensive prosecution of your enquiries into either of those Personages. The first, with all his great gifts, is fairly definable from the other side as a mutinous dissolute Blackguard set on a high place.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had praised Mirabeau in <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> because he &#x201C;made away with &#x2026; all <hi rend="italic">Formulas,</hi>&#x201D; was &#x201C;no man of system &#x2026; only a man of instincts and insights&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 2:140). In <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> TC criticizes Mirabeau&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Monarchie Prussienne</hi> (<date when="1788">1788</date>) for its advocacy of free trade against Frederick&#x2019;s more paternalistic economic policy (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:11).</note> The second has a great deal of <pb id="pg-32-35" n="32:35"/>the Play actor-turned-Pirate in his character and history&#x2014;an immense Gambler &#xE0; la Dick Turpin;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dick Turpin (<date when="1705">1705</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1739">39</date>), highwayman, hanged at York for horse stealing, celebrated in legend and fiction.</note> who after all his huge reckless bettings and enormous temporary successes (more astonishing to the foolish than to the wise) ended by losing his last guinea, and by being flung out of the room headforemost</p>
<p>There is another kind of Heroes to be heard tell of in history, whom I would much rather recommend to an ingenuous young soul, seeking after what is great and noble.</p>

<salute>My Darling</salute>
<p>You cant think what difficulty I have had to keep Geraldine from firing off letters at you every two or three days, with the most alarming accounts of my bodily state! It is her besetting weakness by nature,&#x2014;and her trade of Novelist has aggravated it,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">desire of feeling and producing violent emotions.</hi> When I am well I can laugh down this sort of thing in her; but when I am ill it fatigues me dreadfully, and irritates my moral sense as well as my nerves.

<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, after having several horses on trial, <hi rend="italic">bought</hi> a beautiful one ten days ago, and the first day he rode it, he brought it home some five miles with two shoes lost!

<p>Oh such a fright I got last Friday morning! Thursday night was my <hi rend="italic">second</hi> night of something like <hi rend="italic">human</hi> sleep I had fallen asleep about three and was still sleeping off and on between six and seven, when I was startled wide awake by a heavy fall in the room directly over mine (M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s bedroom)&#x2014; I knew in the very act of waking that it was no table or inaminate thing that made the sound, but a human body! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s of course&#x2014;the only human body there! What <hi rend="italic">could</hi> I think but that he had got up ill, and fallen down in a fit. I threw myself out of bed, tore open my door and began to run up stairs. But my legs got paralized, I leant against the wall and screamed. In answer to my scream, came M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s voice, calling out quite <hi rend="italic">jolly</hi>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s nothing, my Dear! Go back to your bed, it is a mistake.. I will be there presently.&#x201D; Back to my bed I crept: and then, if it had been in my constitution to take a fit of hysterics I should have taken it! As it was, I lay and trembled and my teeth chattered&#x2014;and when M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C came and tried me with some water I could no more swallow it than if I had taken hydrophobia He had awoke too early, and got up to go down stairs and <hi rend="italic">smoke;</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Carlyle was not permitted to smoke in his own bedroom&#x201D; (A.

 <hi rend="italic">his</hi> way of invoking sleep. His room being quite dark, and thinking to put on his stockings and shoes before getting himself light, he had gone to sit down on a chair at the bottom of his bed, where these articles are left; but mistaking the locality, he had sat down on <hi rend="italic">nothing at all!</hi> and fell smack his whole length to the floor&#x2014;not hurting himself in the least for a wonder This adventure has pretty well taken the conceit out of me on the <pb id="pg-32-38" n="32:38"/>score of courage, presence of mind, and all that!

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>I am really grieved to have hurt the feelings of Mr Phillips;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Moses Dresser Phillips, of the Boston publishing firm Phillips, Sampson, &#x26; Co., and founder of the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic</hi> (<date when="1857">1857</date>), to which Emerson was to contribute regularly.</note> a gentleman to whom I, on my side, had no feelings but those of respect and good will! I pray you smooth him down again, by all wise methods, into at least good-natured indifference to me. He may depend upon it I could not mean to irritate him; there lay no gain for me in that! Nor is there anything of business left now between us. It is doubly and trebly evident those Stereotype Plates are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to him worth their prime-cost here,&#x2014;still less, their prime-cost <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> any vestige of definite motive for me to concern myself in them:&#x2014;whereupon the Project falls on its face, &#x26; vanishes forever, with apologies all round.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s original suggestion and Phillips&#x2019;s interest in printing Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s edn. of TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560720-TC-RWE-01"><sic>31:129</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1856-07-20">20 July</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560916-TC-RWE-01"><sic>227</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1856-09-16">16 Sept.</date></corr></ref> Emerson wrote later: &#x201C;I once established some correspondence between Phillips &#x26; Sampson, &#x26; Carlyle &#x2026; but, for I know not what reason, he was churlish &#x26; Scottish &#x26; suspicious, &#x26; would not treat for this very book&#x201D; (Rusk 5:203).</note> For as to that other method, that is a game I never thought, and never should think, of playing at!&#x2014;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note></p>
<p>You may also tell him this little Biographical fact, if you think it will any way help. Some ten or more years ago, I made a similar Bargain with a New-York House<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wiley &#x26; Putnam; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451111-TC-RWE-01"><sic>20:52&#x2013;53</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1845-11-11">11 Nov. 1845</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451229-TC-EC-01"><sic>83&#x2013;84</sic><corr>TC to EC, <date when="1845-12-29">29 Dec. 1845</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460103-TC-RWE-01"><sic>94</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1846-01-03">3 Jan. 18466</date></corr></ref>, and later.</note> (known to you, and now I believe extinct): &#x201C;10&#x201D; or something &#x201C;per cent,&#x201D; of selling price on the Copies Printed, was to be my return&#x2014;not for 4 or &#xa3;500 money laid out, but for various things I did, which gratis would by no <pb id="pg-32-40" n="32:40"/>means have been done; in fine it was their own Offer, made and accepted in due form: &#x201C;10 percent on the copies printed.&#x201D; And how many were &#x201C;printed,&#x201D; thinks Mr Phillips? I saw one set; dreadfully ugly Books, errors in every page:&#x2014;and to this hour I have never heard tell of any other! The account re-mains <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> net;&#x2014;and it would appear there was simply one Copy &#x201C;printed,&#x201D; the ugly one sent to myself, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I instantly despatched again somewhither!&#x2014; &#x2014; On second thoughts perhaps you had better <hi rend="italic">not</hi> tell Mr P. this story, at least not in this way. <hi rend="italic">His</hi> integrity I would not even question by insinuation; nor need I, at the point where we now are. I perceive he sees in extraordinary brilliancy of illumination his own side of the bargain; and thinks me ignorant of several things which I am well enough informed about. In brief, make a perfect peace between us, O friend, and man of peace; and let the wampums be all wrapped up, and especially the tomahawks entirely buried, and the thing <hi rend="italic">end</hi> forever!&#x2014; To you also I owe apologies; but not to you do I pay them, knowing from of old what you are to me.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I write to you sooner than bargain.

In which circumstances your gallant offer seems almost a providential thing; and the question, What you feel yourself deliberately in a condition to do? has a very immediate interest.</p>
<p>I propose that you should come to me on Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1856-12-08">8 Dec.</date></note>&#x2014;Tea is at 7&#xBD; p.m. here, and can wait for you till 8, as it often does with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> reason.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I should have written you half a line, however brief, before this time. It is impossible for you to exaggerate the hurry and confusion I am perpetually kept in, during these bad days and months,&#x2014;likely to continue long yet!</p>
<p>I send you a <hi rend="italic">Photograph,</hi> to replace the spoiled one you have: it seems, all that first set were <hi rend="italic">chemically</hi> spoiled in the doing, and are liable to fade entirely away. I do not find it quite easy to get new ones: but here is yours; I have still one left for myself, and one for some other in need.</p>
<p>Jane continues weak and a prisoner; she is gone today in <hi rend="italic">an Omnibus</hi> (weather being all from S.W. again, and almost like a wet <hi rend="italic">summer</hi>); and this is about the first time she has been out at all for a couple of long months past. However, her sleep does seem to be returning; she is clearly a good deal better.</p>
<p>My own hurry has been greatly increased by the sudden <hi rend="italic">downbreak</hi> of a kind Friend here, who had <hi rend="italic">undertaken</hi> that &#x201C;Edition of my works,&#x201D; and was to leave me alone with <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>k (company <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> for a man), without care about that other. And now,&#x2014;alas!&#x2014;his Brother has suddenly fallen into a <pb id="pg-32-44" n="32:44"/>river, while coming home one ev<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> has perished, and left all his affairs in a heap:&#x2014;so that my poor Friend has to fling &#x201C;the Edition&#x201D; too altogether on my back,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It took Alexander Gilchrist two years to wind up his brother&#x2019;s business affairs (<hi rend="italic">Gilchrist</hi> 57). Lady Sandwich reported inaccurately to Lady Ashburton, <date when="1856-12-27">27 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;[T]he man who was going to publish his works in an edition was drowned so he has that upon his hands also&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note>&#x2014;could I but once get fairly hold of it <hi rend="italic">all;</hi> but even that is impossible hitherto, and only <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> be.&#x2014; &#x2014; My German Clerk<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Martin.</note>

<p>Nor have I been lucky with my Physical Horse! An excellent animal, of whom I had pressing need; was got after, infinite thrice-wearisome negociations and delays; I mounted him, at the <hi rend="italic">last,</hi> Tuesday gone a fortnight; gallopped off with him, joyful (tho&#x2019; the price was &#xa3;52 10 ready money), joyful in to the country lanes: alas, a <hi rend="italic">shoe</hi> had been loose; went off with me, before I had gone far; I had to come <hi rend="italic">creeping</hi> home again. And then,&#x2014;only think of that,&#x2014;the farrier, in <hi rend="italic">re</hi>shoeing him, had knocked (like a blockhead) one of the old nails, not <hi rend="italic">taken out,</hi> completely home into the hoof: so that the creature had to go to a Horse-Doctor, his hoof to be deeply pared away, poulticed &#x26;c;&#x2014;and I have never seen him since; only expect to see him tomorrow,&#x2014;and &#xa3;5 or more to pay! One is not lucky at all points.</p>
<p>But I am getting on, and will get on,&#x2014;Can &#x201C;gar myself do it"<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; TC&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s phrase; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440303-TC-AC-01"><sic>17:292</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1844-03-03">3 March 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> (thank God, like my Father before me): and that is a very great comfort. If it were not for health, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> fear nothing.

There was but little chance of my ever again getting to Ireland: but you were always <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> there,&#x2014;the brightest thing I had seen in that strange Ragged Tragedy of a Country (impressive almost as the Bible, to look into earnestly, and to read in silence);&#x2014;and the thought of you, and that I might see you again, was always like a bit of sunshine in that dark Picture. It is now altered; and I must count you too among those (very many now) who have gone into the Land of Dreams for me.&#x2014; I am sorrier to think of it than perhaps you believe.</p>
<p>Will you accept from me, in token of my blessing on your Pilgrimage, this Photograph, which I have begged for you,&#x2014;the long <hi rend="italic">delay</hi> of it, is the Cause <pb id="pg-32-47" n="32:47"/>why you are so long unanswered;&#x2014;I wanted to send it for behoof of Duffy and you: if you could return me the like, some time or other (<hi rend="italic">both</hi> your faces, the Lady&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">especially</hi>), from the opposite side of the world, how welcome w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> it be!&#x2014; For the present, do not <hi rend="italic">write</hi> to me on this trifling matter; merely indicate, by addressing an old Newspaper to me, that the Shadow has come and been received, and all shall be said.</p>
<p>My hurry in these months, as is like to be for many yet to come, transcends all experience in my past existence; and in fact presses almost crushingly upon me,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I hope to hold out, too, and get my work done, and sorted aside in some tolerable manner, before all end:&#x2014;for the present, A happy voyage, and a blessed new home, to you and yours! No [one] can wish you that more sincerely, I think.</p>
<p>Very kind of you to read in your own devout heart that I am not &#x201C;irreligious.&#x201D; No; that is a most ignorant, dark, and nearly brutish accusation,&#x2014;if it were of any moment.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She wrote: &#x201C;I have long wished to say to you, how much I owe you, of what is best, or rather what struggles to be so, in my life&#x2014; For years, I have habitually gone to you for courage and counsel&#x2014; They tell me you are not religious. It is strange if true for you awake spirituality in me, more than any writer except perhaps Thomas a Kempis&#x2014;. &#x2026; I shall carry your volumes &#x2026; in whatever wilderness my tent is spread they shall find an honored place.&#x201D;</note></p>

<salute>My dear Isabella</salute>
<p><hi rend="italic">Before</hi> your letter came to stir me up, I was on the point of writing to you&#x2014;on &#x201C;the voluntary principle."<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; the principle of being without state funding, e.g., religion (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350810-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:184</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-08-10">10 Aug. 1835</date></corr></ref>) or education (see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510907-JWC-TC-01"><sic>26:158</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1851-09-07">7 sept. 1851</date></corr></ref>).</note> But I am not <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> much exertion yet, and can only do a little each day, in bringing up the arrears of my correspondence, and all other arrears that have accumulated in my life during the last seven or eight weeks.</p>
<p>Then every day of the past week I have gone out for a drive, to help my recovery; and I cannot yet take exercise on my feet. I get into an omnibus at the bottom of our street, settle myself at the further end of it, and get <hi rend="italic">joggled</hi> along some six or seven miles&#x2014;to the end of its line; then transfer myself into an omnibus starting for Chelsea again&#x2014; And thus realize some fourteen miles of carriage exercise at the modest cost of one shilling! A ride in the gig with Jamie, even with that jibbing horse, would be a vast deal pleasanter&#x2014;especially if he bought me <hi rend="italic">sweeties</hi> at Ecclefechan&#x2014; But one must take what one can get and be thankful&#x2014;I had despaired of getting out of doors at all till the winter was over; but who could have anticipated such warm weather as this? The canaries, who were constantly quarrelling and pecking one another during the frost like any human married pair, now <foreign>chirl</foreign> and twitter so lovingly all day long, that I am in terror they carry things the length of <hi rend="italic">laying eggs!</hi>&#x2014;before &#x201C;a breeding cage&#x201D; has been provided! They have got a charming cage <hi rend="italic">to live in</hi> I assure you!&#x2014; I invested all the money that was to have gone to a new winter bonnet in that cage! and trimmed up an old bonnet&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">five years old!</hi> It is light and large the Cage&#x2014;all of brass wire and mahogany&#x2014;with little <hi rend="italic">closets,</hi> roofed with glass, for seed and for water and a small additamental cage, the bottom of which is a white china bath! and which is hooked on to the open door of the large cage when I think the creatures would like to wash themselves. There is much need! they get so dirty in a day&#x2019;s time with the smoky atmosphere, that the mother who hatched them could hardly know them again!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle <hi rend="italic">stands</hi> them better than one would have expected. He even assisted in fixing a pulley in the drawingroom ceiling, by which I swing them up into a region of safety at nights, and when I am out for my drive&#x2014; The cat I fancy, being mostly in the kitchen has not discovered yet that such tempting <pb id="pg-32-49" n="32:49"/>morsels are in the house And Nero, tho&#x2019; only too much alive to their whereabout, <hi rend="italic">dare not</hi> do more than watch them with jealous eyes. The other day as he was sitting all in a tremble gazing up at their movements for an hour together Ann said to him &#x201C;Yes Sir! <hi rend="italic">Worship</hi> them, if <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is what you mean! but take care you don&#x2019;t do anything else!&#x201D;&#x2014; Ann has been very attentive to me, and kept all straight about M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C during my long illness. What a mercy she did not &#x201C;leave&#x201D; as she spoke of doing in a moment of phrenzy about &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">them bugs.</hi>&#x201D; It was an instance of the botheration that may be occasioned by the wagging of an idle tongue. Her &#x201C;giving warning&#x201D; she told me after, was in consequence of Miss Jewsbury&#x2019;s house-maid (a clattering gomeril) having told her that &#x201C;they were all chattering in <hi rend="italic">their</hi> house about poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle not having a place to put her head in for the <hi rend="italic">muddle</hi> with them <hi rend="italic">bugs</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Both <hi rend="italic">the Secretary</hi> and the Horse are valuable acquisitions the Horse especially! A countryman of the Secretarys<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Plattnauer was German; Martin was Swiss in origin but educ. in Germany.</note> wrote to me the other day that he hoped the said secretary was going to prove of great use to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014; &#x201C;as <hi rend="italic">a lightening-conductor!!</hi> There is really some truth in the idea&#x2014;especially while I dont get up to breakfast; so that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Marten is the first to <hi rend="italic">catch it!</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C came down from him the other day much excited&#x2014;and black as thunder&#x2014;I durdn&#x2019;t ask what was wrong; but after vigourous puffing of tobacco smoke over my fire, he turned on me fiercely and said; &#x201C;My Dear, will you tell me what on earth I am to do with that fellow up stairs,&#x201D; &#x201C;Marten?&#x201D; I asked in surprise&#x2014;&#x201C;Why I thought you were satisfied with his work"!&#x2014;&#x201C;His work!&#x2014;Oh his <hi rend="italic">work</hi> is well enough! but how the devil am I to put a stop to his <hi rend="italic">sniffing thro his nose!!</hi>&#x201D; And then he made a frightful immitation of the obnoxious habit, which I then heard of for the first time!</p>

<p>Only think! that dear old Miss Donaldson<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean.</note> at Haddington, the eldest, who is eighty six, and is all but entirely blind, and who had left off all sorts of occupation in consequence, took a notion after I had been there, to knit me &#x201C;a little blanket,&#x201D; before she died; and it came last week&#x2014;so nicely done&#x2014; <pb id="pg-32-50" n="32:50"/>with a letter from the other sister<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jess.</note> who can <hi rend="italic">see,</hi> more or less, I fairly burst out crying over the thing!

<p>What a sad death, that of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Aitken&#x2019;s little child! He was such a large healthy looking child, and she was so very fond of him, and had suffered so much in bringing him into the world.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter is very loyal and good; your offer altogether kind and friendly. I am not without help, volunteer and hired, in these troublesome Enter&#x2014; <pb id="pg-32-51" n="32:51"/>prises of mine; nor is there an immediate neccesity for more. But I make no doubt you too could do acceptable service, if you continued steadily inclined that way.</p>
<p>Perhaps you may as well come and see me at any rate; we shall then see better what is doable, what not. On Tuesday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1856-12-16">16 Dec.</date></note> we are at home, my Wife and I as usual; Tea is at 7&#xBD; o&#x2019;clock: if I hear nothing from you, let us expect you then for an hour and half.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin described JWC on this visit as &#x201C;very kind, but reserved, and I thought looked strangely sorrowful, as if some great trouble were weighing her down; I thought she looked ill, and yet there was evidently something more depressing than mere bodily suffering.&#x201D; After TC had entered and tea was served, Larkin described &#x201C;the strange feeling of reserve which seemed to have taken possession of all three of us. &#x2026; At length Carlyle abruptly introduced the business which had brought me there. &#x2026; Perhaps my face brightened at this, but certainly his own reserve there and then fell from him, and for the first time I felt that I saw Carlyle himself. / He told me the Lives of Sterling and Schiller were the first things requiring attention; and that his wish was to have a summary of each chapter, and an index of both Lives, to be placed at the end of the book. &#x2026; He handed me the books &#x2026; and &#x2026; walked with me a mile or more on my road, talking in a kind, fatherly way, which sent me home gratefully triumphant. Mrs. Carlyle was again very kind at parting; but I saw, with a feeling of perplexed disappointment, the same weary look, almost of indifference, which I had noticed when I entered. I little knew then the wearing misery of her life, and little thought how anxiously she was foreboding that all this &#x2018;romantic devotion,&#x2019; as she afterwards called it, on my part, and Carlyle&#x2019;s ready acceptance of it, must inevitably end in trouble to us both. This was the time which Carlyle, in his Reminiscences, so sadly speaks of, as &#x2018;the nadir of her sufferings&#x2019;&#x201D; (Larkin, <hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 33&#x2013;34).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have gone over the First Volume, under your guidance; and fancy it now ready for the Printer,&#x2014;if once I had seen a glimpse of you again.</p>
<p>The Report (program included) is <hi rend="italic">confirmable</hi> in every particular: a clear reasonable method, and set forth with perfect clearness. It shall be altogether as you say; and you shall do the &#x201C;editing&#x201D; &#x26;c, according to your own beneficent proposal;&#x2014;and I hope very soon to wash my hands of the affair in that manner.</p>
<p>Only come Tomorrow (Saturday) Ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> at the old hour, if you can;&#x2014;and bring along with you the <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi> volume of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Copy:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> (<date when="1850">1850</date>), 3d edn., 4 vols. in 3, acc. to Yale catalog of Beinecke collection. An unidentified and undated bookseller&#x2019;s offering of three vols. of this edn. for sale states that this was &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s copy, used by him in preparing a new edition, with numerous alterations and additions in his hand. This is also the copy used by the printer in setting up the type for the new edition, as it bears many printer&#x2019;s notes throughout.&#x201D; TC noted on the subtitle of vol. 1 for Lushington: &#x201C;Notes added in this 4<hi rend="italic">th.</hi> Edit<hi rend="italic">n.</hi> call them uniformly (Note of <date when="1857">1857</date>) / Mark in <hi rend="italic">the Index</hi> (as you go on) where there is any new matter worth &#x2018;indicating,&#x2019; as at p. 69; <hi rend="italic">item</hi> a new letter there will be (in appendix) to one of Oliver&#x2019;s Aunts (Eliz<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, I think) &#x26;c [to his sister Elizabeth; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:267]. / There is to be no breaking up of the text: the new Pieces (not above a couple of sheets I sh<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> guess) go all into Appx. you know where the divisions of the vols are to be, and that they are 3 again? Probably you will get the <hi rend="italic">copy</hi> in whole before ending this first vol. / Text perfect in here, I believe: guide it well! / T. C. (<date when="1856-12-28">28 Dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1856</date>) / N.b. Keep your copy carefully for the sake of <hi rend="italic">Index</hi>&#x201D; (Yale). There are marginal notes and inserted slips of comments and corrections throughout the three vols.</note> I do not know always what the &#x201C;Appendix&#x201D; treats of by the resources I have.&#x2014; Unfortunately I have hardly cut out any of the <hi rend="italic">references</hi> yet, tho&#x2019; sensible of their tendency to distract the reader&#x2019;s attention from what is chiefly worthy of attending to.</p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Your Letter last night was of the nature of a godsend; bringing you all once more into my actual sphere of vision, after so long an interval: for which beneficent clear glimpse I give thanks; right glad to have it,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the news are not what I expected. By all accounts that could be gathered here, by direct tidings to Lady Sandwich, and rumours of a reflex nature that came, I understood in general that &#x201C;all well&#x201D; was the state of matters; and had no suspicion or imagination that My Lady especially was on the invalid list. But it has been otherwise. I suppose I need not say how glad I shall be to hear your favourable report on that evil matter confirm itself into the certainty you now seem to anticipate! It was of you always that one was in dread; and now it appears you go scot-free, and a thinner-skinned party pays the penalty. Let us hope that that too is on the way to &#x201C;all well.&#x201D; I fall at her Ladyship&#x2019;s feet (as the George-Second Ambassadors do to little George),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George William Frederick (<date when="1738">1738</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820">1820</date>), the future George III. He became Prince of Wales and heir apparent to George II (<date when="1683">1683</date>&#x2013;<date when="1760">1760</date>) when his father, Frederick Louis (<date when="1707">1707</date>&#x2013;<date when="1751">51</date>), died; incident untraced.</note> and make many prayers and promises!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My existence ever since you left us has been sunk a long way <hi rend="italic">under</hi> the common low depth: I can hardly remember to have been in such a boundless bottomless vortex as I had had to swim in for the last three months. Making hardly any perceptible way; yet swimming, not to sink altogether! My country &#x201C;improvement of health&#x201D; vanished altogether with my arrival here,&#x2014;or seemed to vanish, for probably I did get essential good;&#x2014;but the express-train, the town diet, the town life, seemed to have abolished it altogether and <pb id="pg-32-58" n="32:58"/>even made it a negative quantity. Then there was <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>k, like to drive me delirious in the state it lay in; then a New Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of my bits of Books, long clamoured for and now to go on: work with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> limit, and no strength to do it with. I had to get a Horse, by way of trying for some strength of body at least:&#x2014;I am confident you bought Kinloch Luichart Estate with about the tithe of the haggling, trying, corresponding &#x26;c I had on that small matter. However, here he is, an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> little Nag at last (cannot remember to have ridden a nicer, except at The Grange now and then);&#x2014;only no &#x201C;health&#x201D; has yet come; <hi rend="italic">coming,</hi> we will fancy; as permanent <hi rend="italic">headache,</hi> and a general <hi rend="italic">shaking up</hi> of bile have evidently come. Furthermore I picked up a desolate little German with a good hand of writing; made of him a &#x201C;spiritual galloway,&#x201D; so to speak; who has cost me endless trouble;&#x2014;a weak helpless creature, tho&#x2019; a nibling.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; possibly related to &#x201C;nibble,&#x201D; stroke of luck, bargain.</note> His last <hi rend="italic">Clerk</hi> function was with Heyne the Blackguard Paris Jew:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heinrich Heine (<date when="1797">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856">1856</date>), German poet, humorist, and journalist. He was Jewish and enraged both radicals and conservatives when he strategically converted to Christianity in order to practice law in Berlin. After moving to Paris in <date when="1831">1831</date> to join the Saint Simonians (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340526-JWC-TC-01"><sic>7:192</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1834-05-26">26 May 1834</date></corr></ref>) and escape Prussian persecution, he worked as a journalist writing articles on France for <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine Zeitung.</hi> In articles pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes,</hi> later collected in <hi rend="italic">D&#x2019;Allemagne</hi> (<date when="1835">1835</date>), Heine had attacked Frederick the Great&#x2019;s authoritarian influence on German culture. After the <date when="1848">1848</date> revolution, radicals&#x2019; suspicions that Heine was in the pay of Louis Philippe&#x2019;s govt. were strengthened when it was revealed that he had been receiving a pension, probably granted by Thiers V<date when="1840">1840</date> (Jeffrey L. Sammons, <hi rend="italic">Heinrich Heine: A Modern Biography</hi> [Princeton,<date when="1979">1979</date>] 223&#x2013;24). Richard Monckton Milnes wrote a sympathetic account of his life, <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> 104 (<date when="1856-07">July 1856</date>): 192&#x2013;209.</note> I often wonder what the poor creature thinks of being <hi rend="italic">Wagner</hi> to such a <hi rend="italic">pair</hi> of Fausts! We have ridden thro&#x2019; endless square miles of dim dreary &#x201C;Wash&#x201D; (like that of Lincolnshire),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A wide shallow arm of the North Sea from the coast of Lincolnshire, nr. Boston, to the coast of Norfolk.</note> shallow continents of muddy sea; <hi rend="italic">both</hi> shores now invisible, nothing but a hope here and there of getting to some sandbank or mudbank, where the water is not above girth-high, &#x26; so looking round us a little. In short I have been, and am, nearly lost in the mud element;&#x2014;and hugely to be pitied by you and her Ladyship. All goings-<hi rend="italic">out,</hi> in fact all society with fellow-creatures (except my two <hi rend="italic">horses,</hi> &#x2018;spiritual&#x2019; and physical, of whom the latter is the more interesting) have ceased, or as good as <hi rend="italic">ceased.</hi> &#x201C;Christmas Dinner&#x201D; this time will consist of mutton-chop, eaten with the maximum of quietude, within <hi rend="italic">these</hi> poor walls. For, by way of consummation to everything, my poor Wife has fallen Prisoner, to cold &#x26;c; did not get out at all for about two months; and is still very feeble, tho&#x2019; evidently recovering for some weeks past.&#x2014; Lady Sandwich too, as you doubtless know, has been unwell; the last time I saw her Ladyship was with the French Duchess,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Marie Am&#xE9;lie de Bourbon (<date when="1782">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866">1866</date>; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551129-TC-LOA-01"><sic>30:127</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1855-11-29">29 Nov. 1855</date></corr></ref>), who lived in Claremont, Shropshire, though as the widow of Louis Philippe (<date when="1778">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850">1850</date>) of France she might not have been called &#x201C;Duchess&#x201D;; or her da.-in-law Maria Caroline Augusta, b. de Bourbon, duchess d&#x2019;Aumale (<date when="1822">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869">69</date>), m., <date when="1844">1844</date>, to Henri Eug&#xE8;ne Philippe Louis d&#x2019;Orl&#xE9;ans, duke d&#x2019;Aumale (<date when="1822">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1897">97</date>), who also lived in England.</note> who, it <pb id="pg-32-59" n="32:59"/>seems, did all the mischief: day before yesterday, and two other previous times, I found her &#x201C;gone out driving,&#x201D; clearly in a tolerably improved state. She left a card lately, but would not quit her carriage here.&#x2014; &#x2014; On the whole, I cannot think somehow, you have <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> much by Nice <foreign><hi rend="italic">tel quel</hi></foreign> [such as it is]. We have hardly seen the sun physical once a fortnight; sun moral I, for my own poor share, have not seen or heard of at all. Tickets-of-leave<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proposals to change &#x201C;licences to be at large&#x201D; (popularly known as &#x201C;tickets of leave,&#x201D; granted to convicts to give them freedom on condition of good behavior) in the next session of Parliament were much discussed in the Dec. <hi rend="italic">Times;</hi> R. M. Milnes wrote at length, asking the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> to use its influence &#x201C;to appease the terror as well as advise the remedy; and that the remedy be something more than reprisal of brute force and the gratification of social vengeance&#x201D; (<date when="1856-12-16">16 Dec.</date>.) The new law, which abolished the term &#x201C;transportation&#x201D; and introduced remission of part of a sentence for good behavior, was introduced, <date when="1857-06-26">26 June 1857</date>.</note> and Doctors Commons<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Name given to College of Advocates and Doctors of Law, a self-governing teaching body specializing in canon and civil law.

<p><salute>Dear, kind Man!</salute> <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> would have had me answer your letter by return of Post;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1. Craik wrote from Holywood, Belfast, <date when="1856-12-13">13 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;Tell Carlyle that his cordial, kindhearted expressions were meat and drink to my soul. His quick eye too, has perfectly caught my design. The volume really was intended merely as a school-book, an educational manual, for the editors of Shakespeare. &#x2026; I know no set of people that need something of the kind so much. &#x2026; I have had several other gratifying letters about the Book, but there can be no other that I shall value as I do this of Carlyle&#x2019;s.&#x201D; Craik presumably sent TC a prepublication copy of <hi rend="italic">The English of Shakespeare illustrated in a Philological Commentary on Julius Caesar</hi> (<date when="1857">1857</date>). The 2d rev. and improved edn. (<date when="1859">1859</date>) is in Carlyle&#x2019;s House, Chelsea.</note> to tell you I was mortal glad of it, and very pleased that you still liked me! or rather I should say very pleased to hear it. For I knew you too well ever to fancy it could be &#x201C;out of sight out of mind&#x201D; with you; or that any new <pb id="pg-32-60" n="32:60"/>people, never to say Irish people, could displace one you had taken into your heart. Besides did not <hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> still like <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi>?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Craik wrote: &#x201C;Of you and Carlyle &#x2026; I think as often since I have been here as I did when I lived beside you. You are seldom many hours out of my head. What do I not owe to both of you! Words cannot express, thought cannot measure it.&#x201D;</note> and (as I told a man. a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ross<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Ross, Kate Sterling&#x2019;s husband.</note> at Brighton, who thought fit to tell me he had &#x201C;received a most disagreeable impression of me at first sight&#x201D;) you know these things are always mutual! you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> do no otherwise!</p>
<p>This much&#x2014;not about M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ross but the rest of it&#x2014;I felt a need to say at once. The reason which prevented me till now was a rather whimsical one. A letter of <hi rend="italic">thanks</hi> due to an american girl,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elisabeth Dwight.</note> (the Sister of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Edward Twisleton) who had sent me an elaborate piece of needlework made into a lovely chair had lain on my conscience for weeks! and just the day before receiving your letter I had gone and &#x201C;registered a vow in Heaven.&#x201D; that I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> not write to Man Woman or child till I had done &#x201C;what <hi rend="italic">the United States</hi> expected of me"! But a letter of thanks, that has &#x201C;lain on one&#x2019;s conscience for weeks&#x201D; is the Devil and all to write, I can tell you! It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> written now however and this is the very next.</p>
<p>Did that dear little Mary confide to you the fact of my new bonnet?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560719-JWC-MC-01"><sic>31:126</sic><corr>JWC to MC, <date when="1856-07-19">19 July</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;a fine, etherial, altogether irrelevant bonnet which she stood by and let me purchase, nay encouraged me in purchasing to keep up my dignity in Scotland? Well! God forgive her share in the transaction! and now you may tell her; it was <hi rend="italic">no go! literally!</hi>&#x2014; That bonnet did not <hi rend="italic">go</hi> with me to Scotland, after all! On considering the box &#x201C;all to itself&#x201D; it would require, and the rains it would be exposed to, and, above all, the moral shock it might give to individuals remembering <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I was born; I just wrapt it in silk-paper, and locked it away, and haven&#x2019;t seen it since! But myself went to Scotland, all right; and was there ten weeks. A wonderful ten weeks! spent chiefly in being kissed and cried over, by the oldest Inhabitants, wherever I staid! I never could decide all the while, nor can I decide yet, whether I was exquisitely happy or exquisitely miserable! I know only that the state, was <hi rend="italic">exquisite</hi> after one sort or other; and that I shed more tears in those ten weeks than I had done in ten years! and that I often doubted if I were dreaming or awake? A living woman or a ghost? And that I travelled back to London with <hi rend="italic">a birdcage</hi> containing two Haddington Canaries and two <hi rend="italic">flower-pots</hi> containing each&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">weed!!</hi> And that I found on my return I had had more <hi rend="italic">emotion</hi> than was good for me; and fell seriously ill; and was confined to my room seven weeks and that it is only during the last fortnight I have been able to go out, <hi rend="italic">for a drive!</hi>&#x2014;and there you have a complete outline of my history since little Mary and I <pb id="pg-32-61" n="32:61"/>parted.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He wrote: &#x201C;[L]et me bless you for that kind note you wrote to my good little Mary [see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560719-JWC-MC-01"><sic>31:125&#x2013;26</sic><corr>JWC to MC, <date when="1856-07-19">19 July</date></corr></ref>]. It was the crowning triumph of her London visit, and will be a precious possession to her. &#x2026; She really deserves too, let me say it, your good opinion of her honest, simple, unselfish nature. As I read what you wrote I seemed to hear you speaking the words. / I do not find that distance and separation and even suspension of all positive intercourse with my friends of other days at all weaken my attachment to them.&#x201D;</note> If you were sitting here beside me, and I wish you were; or if there were any brief dagueratype process by which I could transfer the details of that journey thro&#x2019; old homes, the chief pleasure of which was being cried over, and the chief objects <hi rend="italic">graves!</hi> I would not let you off with an outline.</p>
<p>For the rest; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has made two great acquisitions lately&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">secretary</hi> (german). The horse is a Beauty, and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C. says &#x201C;a remarkable combination of courage and sensibility"; the Secretary is decidedly ugly, and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C always speaks of him as &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">that fellow up stairs.</hi>&#x201D; Plattnauer &#x201C;hopes&#x2014;he (the <hi rend="italic">famulus</hi>) is going to prove of great use to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;as <hi rend="italic">a Lightening-Conductor</hi>&#x201D;; I hope so too&#x2014; Certainly I have noticed that on the days when one hears what my servant calls &#x201C;the sound of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Marten <hi rend="italic">catching it</hi>&#x201D;; <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> mildness is remarked down stairs.</p>
<p>Dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Craik I well understand all you say to me about your Wife.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeanette, b. Dempster, who d. earlier in the year. Craik wrote: &#x201C;I will not talk to you now of my poor wife. But I may when we meet. The blank that her loss has made to me is very great. For thirty years she had been with me through it all&#x2014;a constant companion, a constant care. And &#x2026; in losing her I seem to have lost a main purpose for which I lived. Nor do I find &#x2026; that the sense of deprivation lightens with the lapse of time.&#x201D;</note> It was just <hi rend="italic">so,</hi> I fancied you would be feeling her loss. Your sorrow is the price you pay for being unselfish, loyal, tender.

<p>But you must come away as soon as you are at liberty, must come and see us all, and get your thoughts shaken out of the circular train which they naturally fall into when every thing present to the senses suggests a recent grief. Many will be delighted to see you here&#x2014;besides <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014; And I will introduce you to my canaries with whom and dear little Nero I mostly <hi rend="italic">live</hi> at present.

<p>I often think of that visit to Aberleddy;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aberlady; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560813-JWC-TC-01"><sic>31:174</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1856-08-13">13 Aug. 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> and those children stark naked, and dripping wet; the drops on them sparkling in the sunshine like diamond beads as they held up their little mouths to be kissed; and such a beautiful sea for a background! There never was a prettier sight before or since! At least, not since Venus issued from the sea and was kissed by <hi rend="italic">The Seasons!!</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At her birth from the waves of the sea, Venus is said to have been greeted by the goddesses of the seasons, who clothed her and accompanied her to Paphos in Cyprus and Mount Olympus.</note> &#x2026; The canaries have gained all hearts in this house (but one!). Even Mr Carlyle takes to them; tho&#x2019; truth to say, I rather expected he would wring their necks! &#x2026; I have not been well enough to go down to breakfast for upwards of eight weeks but the other morning, the doors being all open, I was thunderstruck to hear my young friends chirruping at the very top of their lungs! When Mr C came into my room soon after, I apologized for the disturbance, and spoke of removing the cage. &#x2018;Oh let them alone there!&#x2019; said he &#x2018;the little wretches have been all this time <hi rend="italic">as merry as maltsters!</hi> But their incessant distracted <foreign>chirling</foreign> rather amuses me!&#x2019; The <hi rend="italic">one</hi> heart they have failed to gain is my Dog&#x2019;s! He is in fact madly <hi rend="italic">jealous</hi> of them, and has been so all along!

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; in very great haste (as usual!), I will write you a word just now, lest there be no time at all farther on.</p>
<p>We are in the old way; Jane still mostly a prisoner, tho&#x2019; very considerably better, and getting on, in-doors in a contracted kind of existence, tolerably, considering. I, thanks to the Horse, feel as if I were, in some faint perceptible degree <hi rend="italic">better:</hi> the riding is but uncomfortable, in such weather; mostly in the <hi rend="italic">dusk</hi> too, otherwise I cannot get a days work done at all: my swift galloping &#x26;c withal has &#x201C;stirred up&#x201D; endless &#x201C;bile,&#x201C;&#x2014;swollen face, <hi rend="italic">gum</hi>-ache, continuance of headache (quite unusual things): but I consider, and even partly feel, all this is on the right road, and will lead to real improvement. Human speech cannot describe the <hi rend="italic">in</hi>human state of body I have been in, more and more, for years past.&#x2014; &#x2014; The worst at present is, We have frost, slippery roads; and my riding is out for the last 3 days! Dangerous, these glass roads, crowded with vehicles; and nobody <hi rend="italic">roughens</hi> here, seemingly (frost so &#x201C;uncertain&#x201D;); but <hi rend="italic">waits</hi> for thaw.</p>
<p>For the last week I have been drawing up a &#x201C;Chronological Summary&#x201D; (with a Blessing on it!) for the <hi rend="italic">French R</hi>n, last vol. Happily I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> now done with it,&#x2014;forever and a day! <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> too is about ready for the Printer I have torn out a <hi rend="italic">Print</hi> of his here, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is tolerably good and of no use whither it was going. Perhaps you have some little Frame for it; or somebody you want to favour has?&#x2014;</p>
<p>Poor Samuel Brown never wrote me anything that was worth printing.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Samuel Brown had d. <date when="1856-09-20">20 Sept.</date>; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560823-JWC-TC-01"><sic>31:190</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1856-08-23">23 Aug. 1856</date></corr></ref>. His <hi rend="italic">Lectures on the Atomic Theory, and Essays Scientific and Literary,</hi> 2 vols., were collected and pbd. posthumously (Edinburgh, <date when="1858">1858</date>). Presumably Jean had sent a request from Thomas Aird, ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald,</hi> who had been a friend of Brown&#x2019;s; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530119-TC-JCA-01"><sic>28:14</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1853-01-19">19 Jan. 1853</date></corr></ref>.</note> I believe there may be one or two old Notes of his, stowed by in some dusty corner; but really they never were or could be of any significance; nor <hi rend="italic">could</hi> I find them (if they exist at all): Let the answer therefore be, &#x201C;Alas, nothing!&#x201D;&#x2014; Poor Browne; he had something very fine in him, fine and high-aiming, and his fated course was tragical. They tried to help him by &#x201C;praise&#x201D; too, and favour; and did him only ill by it. Nobody can help a man!&#x2014;</p>
<p>What a tragedy too is that of Hugh Miller! A solid stonemason soul, with a great deal of fresh manful quality and health in it; becomes &#x201C;literary"; catches up &#x201C;Free-Kirk,&#x201D; and is caught by it; &#x201C;geology&#x201D; &#x26;c, and a crowd of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gomerals</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-32-67" n="32:67"/>huzzaing around:&#x2014;till the issue is, this!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hugh Miller shot himself, <date when="1856-12-24">24 Dec.</date> There was speculation that his suicide was the result of his inability to &#x201C;reconcile Geology with the Bible&#x201D; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 5:280&#x2013;81), though there was no evidence to support this view. The <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1856-12-29">29 Dec.</date>, reported that a post mortem had revealed a disease of the brain and that after experiencing several seizures in previous months, Miller was afraid that he was losing his mind. His obituary described him as a man of &#x201C;amiable disposition,&#x201D; &#x201C;generous spirit,&#x201D; and &#x201C;humble piety,&#x201D; looking like &#x201C;a shepherd from the Ross-shire hills rather than an author or a man of science.&#x201D; It concluded: &#x201C;Literature and science have lost in him one of their brightest ornaments, and Scotland one of its greatest men.&#x201D; For TC&#x2019;s contact with Miller, see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540309-TC-HMI-01"><sic>29:44</sic><corr>TC to HMI, <date when="1854-03-09">9 March 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; I will write soon again. <closer><salute>With kind love to all,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mary</salute>
<p>The Box came yesterday all safe&#x2014;not so much as one egg cracked! and just in time to have one of the fowls boiled for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s dinner. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C dines all by himself at present; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> merely looking on!

Since my illness, that is to say pretty nearly ever since I returned from Scotland<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1856-10-04">4 Oct. 1856</date>.</note> I have used my privilege of Invalid (and no doubt about it) to dine at the hour when nature and reason prompt me to dine, viz: 2 oclock; instead of at M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s fashionable hour of six. So <hi rend="italic">my</hi> go at the fowl comes off today. They look famous ones; and as for the goose!&#x2014;Heaven and Earth! what a goose!&#x2014; Even Ann, who is so difficult to warm up to bare satisfaction point with anything of an <hi rend="italic">eatable</hi> sort, stood amazed before that goose&#x2014;&#x201C;as in presence of <hi rend="italic">The Infinite</hi>"!

<salute>Dear Miss Smith,</salute>
<p><hi rend="italic">This</hi> time you come to me as an old acquaintance, whom I am glad to shake hands with again. The mere fact of your being still in the same position after so long an interval, and with such passionate inward protest as that first letter indicated,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For JWC&#x2019;s first letter to Smith, when she advised against a literary life, see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540116-JWC-MS-01"><sic>29:20&#x2013;21</sic><corr>JWC to MS, <date when="1854-01-16">16 Jan. 1854</date></corr></ref>. Smith wrote: &#x201C;Poetry indeed was through all the hard periods of my life, my joy and strength, the uplifter of my soul in trouble. Now it was that the very prospect of a literary career&#x2014;always the cherished ideal of my soul&#x2014;seemed forever blocked out of my prospects and hopes. I, who would cheerfully have gone ragged and barefoot to have had the meanest place in the temple of lofty learning, was now, by my very success as a teacher, and with my own hand, bolting the door of my own higher hopes on my soul. &#x2026; [T]he prosperity of my school rather depressed than gladdened me. Urged on by these feelings &#x2026; I conceived the bold idea of writing to Mrs Carlyle &#x2026; telling her the state of my mind and asking her advice&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 242).</note> is a more authentic testimony to your worth, than if you had sent me a <hi rend="italic">certificate of character</hi> signed by all the clergy and householders of Carlisle!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Smith ran a boarding school, 11 West Tower St., Carlisle, from <date when="1852">1852</date>: &#x201C;I was seven years at 11 West Tower-street. It was a busy and somewhat eventful time. I have given a brief glimpse into my inner life, showing myself up most likely as an incomprehensible being. My object has been to show the inner cravings of my soul after literary pursuits, which, being a woman, I failed to attain, despite of all my self-denial and persistent endeavours. &#x2026; I had higher visions than matrimony; literature, poetry, and religion gleamed fair before me. Had I been a young man, how gladly should I have gone into the Nonconformist ministry, and should probably have been accepted. But as a woman I had to struggle with all sorts of difficulties, hardships and insults; being in the world, but not of it, nor aspiring after any of its flimsy gewgaws. &#x2026; My school increased more and more, for if I lost my best scholars, I had still new ones brought. So I worked on, little disconcerted by my difficulties, nor was my life unhappy. I had no debts. My work was my comfort&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 192, 197, 201).</note> So many talents are wasted, so many enthusiasms turned to smoke, so many lives blighted, for want of a little patience and endurance! for want of understanding and laying to heart that which you have so well expressed in these verses&#x2014;the meaning of <hi rend="italic">the Present!</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Present,&#x201D; one of the poems Smith pbd. in <hi rend="italic">Poems.

<p>I can&#x2019;t think how people, who have any natural ambition, and any sense of power in them, escape going <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> in a world like this, without the recognition of that! I know I was very near <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> when I found it out for myself (as one has to find out for one-self <hi rend="italic">everything</hi> that is to be of any real practical use to one). Shall I tell you how it came into my head? Perhaps it may be of comfort to you in similar moments of fatigue and disgust.</p>
<p>I had gone with my husband to live on a little estate of <hi rend="italic">peat bog,</hi> that had descended to me, all the way down from John Welsh, the Covenanter, who married a daughter of John Knox.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s ancestor was Elizabeth Knox&#x2019;s brother-in-law David Welsh of Colliston (near Craigenputtoch); see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251128-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:420</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-11-28">28 Nov. 1825</date></corr></ref>. TC implied that JWC&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s family did not inherit Craigenputtoch from John and Elizabeth Welsh when he wrote that &#x201C;a better probability perhaps is the <hi rend="italic">topographical</hi> one that Craigenputtock &#x2026; did apparently form part of <hi rend="italic">Collieston,</hi> fertile little <hi rend="italic">farm</hi> still extant,&#x201D; but he apparently accepted the claim that they were descended from John rather than David Welsh (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 108&#x2013;9).</note> That didn&#x2019;t, I am ashamed to say, make me feel Craigenputtock a whit less of a peat bog, and most dreary, untoward place to live at! In fact, it was sixteen miles distant on every side from all the conveniences of life&#x2014;shops and even post office!</p>
<p>Further, we were very poor; and further and worst, being an only child, and brought up to &#x201C;great prospects,&#x201D; I was sublimely ignorant of every branch of useful knowledge, though a capital Latin scholar and a very fair mathematician!! It behoved me in these astonishing circumstances to learn&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">sew!</hi> Husbands, I was shocked to find, wore their stockings into holes! and were always losing buttons! and I was expected to &#x201C;look to all that!&#x201D; Also, it behoved me to learn to <hi rend="italic">cook!</hi> No <hi rend="italic">capable</hi> servant choosing to live at &#x201C;such an out of the way place,&#x201D; and my husband having &#x201C;bad digestion,&#x201D; which complicated my difficulties dreadfully. The bread, above all, brought from Dumfries, &#x201C;soured on his stomach,&#x201D; (Oh, Heavens!) and it was plainly my duty as a christian wife to bake at home!</p>
<p>So I sent for Cobbett&#x2019;s &#x201C;Cottage Economy,"<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Cobbett, <hi rend="italic">Cottage Economy</hi> (<date when="1824">1824</date>); chaps. 3 and 4 are on bread making, 3 arguing that bread is a better staple food than potatoes and 4 giving step-by-step directions for bread making.</note> and fell to work at a loaf of bread. But knowing nothing about the process of fermentation or the heat of <pb id="pg-32-72" n="32:72"/>ovens, it came to pass that my loaf got put into the oven at the time <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> ought to have put into bed, and I remained the only person not asleep, in a house in the middle of a desert! <hi rend="italic">One</hi> o&#x2019;clock struck, and then <hi rend="italic">two,</hi> and then <hi rend="italic">three;</hi> and still I was sitting there in an intense solitude, my whole body aching with weariness, my heart aching with a sense of forlornness and degradation. &#x201C;That I who had been so petted at home, whose comfort had been studied by everybody in the house, who had never been required to do anything but <hi rend="italic">cultivate my mind,</hi> should have to pass all those hours of the night in watching <hi rend="italic">a loaf of bread!</hi> which mightn&#x2019;t turn out bread after all!"</p>
<p>Such thoughts maddened me, till I laid down my head on the table, and sobbed aloud. It was then that somehow the idea of Benvenuto Cellini, sitting up all night watching his Pericles [Perseus]<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Smith prints &#x201C;Pericles&#x201D;; Froude, who says Smith sent him the letter, has &#x201C;Perseus.&#x201D; Bliss notes that it was &#x201C;undoubtedly a copyist&#x2019;s error; Mrs. Carlyle would never have written anything but Perseus&#x201D; (257). Benvenuto Cellini (<date when="1500">1500</date>&#x2013;<date when="1571">1571</date>) described casting the statue of Perseus in his <hi rend="italic">Autobiography;</hi> see also <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-geraldine-jewsbury-to-froude"><sic>30:266</sic><corr>GEJ to JAF, <date when="1876-11-22">22 Nov. 1876</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-ellen-twisleton-account-of-life-at-craigenputtoch"><sic>271</sic><corr>Ellen Twisleton&#x2019;s Account of Life at Craigenputtoch</corr></ref>.</note> in the oven, came into my head; and suddenly I asked myself, &#x201C;After all; in the sight of the upper powers, what is the mighty difference between a statue of Pericles [Perseus] and a loaf of bread, so that each be the thing one&#x2019;s hand hath found to do? The man&#x2019;s determined will, his energy, his patience, his resource, were the really admirable things, of which the statue of Pericles [Perseus] was the mere chance expression. If he had been a woman, living at Craigenputtock, with a dyspeptic husband, sixteen miles from a baker, and <hi rend="italic">he a bad one</hi>&#x2014;all these same qualities would have come out most fitly in a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> loaf of bread!"</p>
<p>I cannot express what consolation this germ of an idea spread over my uncongenial life, during five years we lived at that savage place; where my two immediate predecessors had gone <hi rend="italic">mad,</hi> and the third had taken to drink!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The 3d was Mrs. William Blacklock, JWC&#x2019;s immediate predecessor; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270603-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:226</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-06-03">3 June 1827</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-ellen-twisleton-account-of-life-at-craigenputtoch"><sic>30:267</sic><corr>Ellen Tiwsleton&#x2019;s Account of Life at Craoigenputtoch</corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>But here am I beginning on a third little sheet and you are waiting for my opinion of the verses!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Smith had apparently sent JWC several poems in addition to &#x201C;The Present.&#x201D;</note> If you knew how completely I have lost all taste for poetry (so called), you would not have appealed to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> judgment of all peoples! Indeed, I should need to have been a poet born, to have continued writing or reading anything in verse, in the valley of the shadow of Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s denunciations of verse! I suppose, too, as one gets old, one naturally falls back on plain prose. But since you have asked my opinion, it would be discourteous to refuse it, even on the plea of incompetence.</p>
<p>I have read these verses very carefully several times over, and what I feel about them is that they are full of <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sense,</hi> and deficient in <hi rend="italic">music.</hi> They give me the impression of thought put into verse by <hi rend="italic">force of will,</hi> rather than from a natural <hi rend="italic">taste for singing itself.</hi></p>
<p><pb id="pg-32-73" n="32:73"/>My husband once asked Monkton Milnes<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Monckton Milnes.</note> why he put what he had to say into rhymes, &#x201C;instead of <hi rend="small-caps">just saying it</hi>.&#x201D; The answer was&#x2014;&#x201C;Why you see, a very little thought goes so much further in verse!&#x201D; Now, it seems to me, that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> do not lie under that general exigence of modern poets, driving them on expedients to make a little thought go further than its natural length. There is more thought in the verses you have sent me, than might be elaborated into a long prose essay&#x2014;more thought than in several volumes of poems, lying about on drawing room tables. But it is hurt rather than shown to advantage by the versification, which is hard and stiff&#x2014;in a word, <hi rend="italic">unmusical.</hi></p>
<p>I should hardly have trusted my own judgment in such a matter, if Mr. Carlyle had not confirmed it. I read the verses to him, having first given him my notions about them, and he said&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, they are just what you said. The young lady has something in her to write, but she should resolve on sticking to prose.&#x201D; That from him was rather high praise, I assure you.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I got the two Cromwell volumes all right: &#x201C;many thanks!&#x201D; I may well say, and feel. You have saved me a great deal of time and labour; and done the business as well or better than if I had myself been in it.</p>
<p>I have not gone into the <hi rend="italic">removal</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">markers</hi> yet: but probably shall this evening; I guess it may be an hour&#x2019;s work or little more.</p>
<p>You wish me to say &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">sand</hi> hills,&#x201D; then, instead of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">chalk</hi> hills&#x201D;? That surely will be worth doing in the circumstances.&#x2014; As to <hi rend="italic">die</hi> meaning properly &#x201C;live&#x201D; (or something like it),&#x2014;I still cannot make sense of the passage unless in that way: &#x201C;If y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Daughter bring a son to Dick and you, you pay, at sight of that phenomenon, &#xa3;2,000; at <hi rend="italic">any</hi> rate in six months after the marriage, you pay &#xa3;1,000, and if Dorothy have no child (or only daughters, which seems the same), you will not be asked for the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> &#xa3;1,000.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:309, 7:2&#x2013;3 and 18&#x2013;19.</note></p>
<p>But all this is superfluous at present. What I had to do was to ask you to come to us (at the old hour, in the old way) on Thursday Ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1857-01-15">15 Jan.</date></note> when there is to be a Welsh-English friend of ours making a call, who wants to know you, and whose acquaintance I think will not be disagreeable to you.

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>Among my own muddy tribulations I always flattered myself you were well and in a sunny element; but this also, it appears, is not so. &#x201C;Discouraged,&#x201D; &#x201C;languor,&#x201D; &#x201C;gone out to ride the first time&#x201C;&#x2014;what am I to think of all that? Among the many fine things I have loved in you, the bright frank <hi rend="italic">courage</hi> of your mind, the healthy promptitude with which you shook away annoyances, and walked on as if <hi rend="italic">incompatible</hi> with &#x201C;mud&#x201D; (in which I may be said to dwell) was always one. Be not &#x201C;discouraged&#x201D;; no! There are better times coming round again; the brave true heart can (full surely) <hi rend="italic">make</hi> for itself better times. If we have gone astray, on miry thorny paths,&#x2014;we must return again. There is still a sky overhead, and green Earth underfoot; and this is &#x201C;the Place of Hope,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301010-TC-MAC-01"><sic>5:171</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1830-10-10">10 Oct. 1830</date></corr></ref> and Tarr, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 121.</note> while we continue here!&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x201C;New-Year&#x2019;s wishes&#x201D;; my poor wishes, hopes and homages, these cannot fail, while years run for me new or old.&#x2014;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Sandwich had reported to Lady Ashburton, <date when="1856-12-27">27 Dec.</date>, that TC &#x201C;desired all things to you&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note></p>
<p>For the rest you may judge if I have been &#x201C;happy,&#x201D; by the one fact that this is the first time you hear from me. Ever since you went away, it is as if the windows of Heaven (or of some other place) had been opened, and nothing but deluges of shot-rubbish had been poured upon me in the dark winter weather! I will not recapitulate what his Lordship will have already told you. The truth is I am wrestling fiercely to do a piece of work set to me for which, on the given terms, I am not equal. I rather despise it too, as I go along,&#x2014;&#x201C;could do infinitely better <hi rend="italic">work</hi> than that&#x201C;:&#x2014;but this I cannot do, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seem; and yet must do it, under nameless penalties, and will. That is the short story; capable of spreading wide enough when run into practical details!&#x2014;</p>
<p>One of the best things in my lot is the excellent little Horse I have; on which I go daily splashing thro&#x2019; the mud,&#x2014;forgetting, more or less for a <pb id="pg-32-75" n="32:75"/>couple of hours, the spiritual welter I otherwise live in.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton had reported to Lady Ashburton: &#x201C;Carlyle came in also upon his charger, low about himself and his work, but not looking ill&#x201D; (n.d.; MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note> From the Norwood heights I see Addiscombe;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons&#x2019; estate, nr. Croydon, 10 mi. S of London. Norwood Ridge is a hilly area, 1&#xBD; mi. N of Addiscombe.</note> think how easy it were to gallop out thither, were there anything now there for me. Patience; perhaps there will again!&#x2014; &#x2014; My German Famulus proves but a weak animal; willing but ineffectual; the good to be got of him questionable altogether.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Sandwich wrote, <date when="1856-12-27">27 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;Mr Carlyle is half demented &#x2026; by a half wild German amanuensis who worries his life out &#x26; snorts in a way which drives him wild&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note></p>

<p>Here is the <hi rend="italic">Fethard</hi> Letter;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 9:257&#x2013;58. Fethard is in Ireland, Co.

In short I get real benefit from the creature; and shall still more, I am persuaded.</p>
<p>Jane was very proud of her stockings, tho&#x2019; they were not the kind that suit,&#x2014;more is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> blame! She cannot do except with fine <hi rend="italic">knit</hi> stockings (not woven ones):&#x2014;with my advice she therefore <hi rend="italic">changed</hi> yours into the right sort, at a Scotch shop here,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> and now she <hi rend="italic">is</hi> stockinged by <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to her mind, all the same. <closer><salute>With thanks!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks again to you. There cannot be a doubt but <hi rend="italic">Scheme IV</hi> is the preferable one: Vol I to go as far as the end of Part IV and have the Squire Papers;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Squire&#x2019;s forgeries of Cromwell letters and papers that TC still accepted as genuine; see vols. 21, 22, and 24, and <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:339&#x2013;76.</note> vol II to &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;in fact it is the same division as in the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Edition (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is of 3 volumes), with the <hi rend="italic">Squire</hi> added to Vol I, and something more of Appendix to vol IV.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vol. 1 of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> (<date when="1857">1857</date>) ends with the warrant for Charles I&#x2019;s execution, <date when="1649-01">Jan. 1649</date> and the appendix of Squire papers; vol. 2 ends with part 7 on &#x201C;The Little Parliament, <date when="1651">1651</date>&#x2013;<date when="1653">53</date>&#x201D; and an appendix of the List of the Long Parliament and Lists of the Eastern-Association Committees; vol. 3 ends with a chap. on the &#x201C;Death of the Protector&#x201D; (<date when="1658">1658</date>), and 34 appendices containing some new letters, speeches, miscellaneous information, fragments, and the index.</note> Vol II is too small; but we can by no plan help such <pb id="pg-32-79" n="32:79"/>inequality <hi rend="italic">somewhere;</hi> and here it falls in the <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> of the file, which is better (as soldiers also know) than at either <hi rend="italic">end.</hi> Not to say that every vol. ends in this way with a kind of <hi rend="italic">epoch:</hi> Death of Charles I; Protectorate; Death of Oliver. In short I vote clearly that we stand by Scheme IV.</p>
<p>If you be within wind at all any evening, I am seldom or never so busy that I should not like to see you for a little;&#x2014;failing such a bit of luck, I must make some special movement that way before long.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your work, I can well perceive, is faithful, solid and judicious; in substance just what was wanted. I have not yet had time to go into it in practical detail; but so much I can see, and certify to you. Surely I owe you many thanks&#x2014;for what you have done, and for what you are still doing and willing to go on doing.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin had volunteered to help TC with preparations for publication of his collected works; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561214-TC-HL-01">TC to HL, <date when="1856-12-14">14 Dec. 1856</date></ref>. &#x201C;While preparing the index, &#x26;c., I noted two or three little points which seemed dubious, and called attention to them by slips of paper between the leaves, on which I wrote only what was necessary, thinking it would thus be very little trouble for him to glance at the page, and then do anything or nothing as he saw fit. There was nothing of any great importance. &#x2026; It was not long before I received the following very encouraging acknowledgment&#x201D; (Larkin, <hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 34).</note></p>
<p>Both <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi> and verbal <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> will be wanted (that is now my plan) for this volume, and for the Collected Works in general. I mean that there shall be such a <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi> as you have drawn up for <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin began with <hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling</hi> (<date when="1851">1851</date>).</note> (only <hi rend="italic">briefer</hi> perhaps) to each volume; and then that there shall be, printed in the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> volume a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">General Index,</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;which of course is only to be got by doing a verbal <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> for each volume; so that the Printer (altering the page-n<hi rend="italic">os</hi> to the new form of the volumes) may at length melt all the Indexes into one.</p>
<p>In this point of view I will beg you to proceed; and you shall have plenty more of work, if you like it,&#x2014;no fear of that! For except the <hi rend="italic">F</hi>h <hi rend="italic">Revolution</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is to be sent you in a day or two)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> was pbd. in <date when="1857-01">Jan.</date></note> and <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will come next,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pbd. late <date when="1857-02">Feb.</date> to <date when="1857-04">April</date>; see <ref target="volume-32/ed-32-athanaeum-advertisements"><sic>appendix 1</sic><corr><corr><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> Advertisements</corr></corr></ref>.</note> none of the volumes hitherto have either <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Summary.</hi> Nor can my poor Clerk, whom I have tried at both businesses, do either of them in a tolerable way.</p>
<p>It appears clear to me the only fault of this <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> Summary, and Sterling <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> perhaps still more, will be their over-minuteness; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> surely, as you <pb id="pg-32-84" n="32:84"/>remark, is a fault on the right side, and easy to mend. However, I shallpractically (I hope, when once some present hurries are over), and judge for myself. Meanwhile please go on with the <hi rend="italic">Schiller,</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Life of Friedrich Schiller</hi> (<date when="1825">1825</date>).</note> with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> abatement of vigilance, but keeping that (probable) fault in your eye. The <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi> to each volume ought not, I think, to exceed 7 or 8 pages at the outside;&#x2014;how much of your <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> that amounts to you will see when the F<hi rend="italic">h</hi> R<hi rend="italic">n</hi> comes; and you can try to conform in some measure to that condition. By the <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> to the Fr<hi rend="italic">h</hi> R<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> you will also form some judgement about the degree of detail requisite in a Gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Index.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In vol. 2 of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister,</hi> vol. 16 of the cheap edn., pbd. <date when="1858-09">Sept. 1858</date>.</note> Nothing important to be omitted, nor anything insignificant let in: that is the clear Theory;&#x2014;but as to Practice, in that, as in all things, we require (as the Hindoo Algebraist says of Quadratic Equations in complex cases) &#x201C;a clear judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and the blessings of God&#x201D;!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Hindu mathematician and astronomer Aryabhata (<date when="0476">476</date>&#x2013;<date when="0550">550</date>?); quotation untraced, but possibly from his <hi rend="italic">Aryabhatiya,</hi> in verse and a summary of mathematics as known in his time.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>So soon as you have done <hi rend="italic">Schiller,</hi> do not fail to bring it, I mean yourself along with it, that we may have another meeting;&#x2014;the sooner the better; and in fact so soon as you have got the F<hi rend="italic">h</hi> R<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Index examined, more especially if I have got your <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> well looked into withal, it might be good that we met.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There is not to be any &#x201C;Summary&#x201D; to <hi rend="italic">Cromwell:</hi> alone of all the volumes those three are thought not to require one; the Story being so straight, with so good an <hi rend="italic">Index,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> goes <hi rend="italic">along with it.</hi> No doubt a good Summary w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be advantageous too; but it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take trouble, and the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> vol. then is already too large.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin had offered &#x201C;to prepare a summary of Cromwell to be added to the existing index, and to be in time for the third volume. &#x2026; Perhaps I was even a little urgent, for I well recollect feeling how glad I should have been to give the whole story of Cromwell such a thorough study, as the faithful preparation of a summary would necessarily involve. &#x2026; I received in reply the following significant manifesto from the throne&#x201D; (35).</note>&#x2014; Please, therefore, continue the <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> with your best skill:&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">briefer,</hi> your one improvement. That vol. is to <hi rend="italic">follow</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell.</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Publication of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>&#x2019;s 3 vols. was completed late <date when="1857-04">April</date>; <hi rend="italic">Lives of Friedrich Schiller and John Sterling</hi> was pbd. early <date when="1857-06">June</date>; see <ref target="volume-32/ed-32-athanaeum-advertisements"><sic>appendix 1</sic><corr><corr><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> Advertisements</corr></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-32-86" n="32:86"/>I looked over <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> last night. There appear to be <hi rend="italic">no</hi> &#x201C;errors of the press,&#x201D; then? I take your careful survey as guarantee of that. These are the chief things to be looked after as you read. Breaking in upon the Text,&#x2014;of course it must be done if there is an absolute <hi rend="italic">mistake;</hi> but otherwise I always avoid it, with a kind of shudder!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin wrote that he had &#x201C;never allowed any bias &#x2026; to prevent my summaries and indexes from giving a perfectly frank indication of the contents of the books to which they referred. Upon this point Carlyle very soon became entirely satisfied. But these were early days with us; and I suppose, for many reasons, he deemed it necessary to give me a timely caution against any tampering with the royal prerogative. &#x2026; I confess I felt somewhat disconcerted at being thus sharply pulled-up. &#x2026; There was really nothing in my very trivial memoranda, that could with any reason be called &#x2018;breaking in upon the text&#x2019;; but he evidently had a very real horror of anything of the kind, and he resolved to nip all that sort of irrelevancy in the bud.&#x201D; Larkin assured TC that his one wish was to help him, &#x201C;not to meddle or hinder in any way.&#x201D; After this, he and TC understood each other better (35&#x2013;36).</note> The thing has congealed itself <hi rend="italic">so;</hi> cold and hard now, burning hot as it once was: so let it lie in God&#x2019;s name!&#x2014; I will alter &#x201C;long-clothes,&#x201D; for that seems to be a real error;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin recalled that TC &#x201C;had spoken of Sterling in his first few years as being still in &#x2018;long clothes&#x2019;; and I pointed out that this was a form of expression usually applied by mothers to the bird-of-paradise apparel, in which they adorn their infants before there is any possibility of the little feet alighting on the ground, and was hardly applicable to a boy trotting by his father&#x2019;s side. I also called attention to an extract which had evidently been tucked-in after the rest was written, and which wanted some slight grammatical dovetailing. Besides this, there were two or three instances of what seemed to be imperfect punctuation&#x201D; (34). In the 1st edn. of <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> TC had written: &#x201C;young John, still in long clothes&#x201D; (12); it was changed to &#x201C;young John still in petticoats&#x201D; in later edns.; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:8.</note> and I am glad to know it, there and for the future.</p>
<p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> I ought to try to shape a little bit according to my own notions of the space allowable; and I will, if time at all permit. But on the whole you would oblige me much if (after looking into the F<hi rend="italic">h</hi> R<hi rend="italic">n</hi>) you could undertake that too yourself, and compress as needful. For the Gen<hi rend="italic">l Index</hi> I can give no better model than the partial one attached to <hi rend="italic">Cromwell.</hi></p>
<p>I am very sorry I misread your &#x201C;Highbury.&#x201D; That must be the reason you have yet got no Copy of the F<hi rend="italic">h</hi> R<hi rend="italic">n:</hi> Chapman the Publisher was sent upon &#x201C;Islington&#x201D; too, and c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not shift like the Postman. This minute I write to him the right Address. If in a couple of days you hear nothing, pray call at 193. Piccadilly and speak. But that, I believe, will not now be necessary.</p>
<p>I am here for you any ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> whatever, for an hour or so, Tea at half past 7;&#x2014;you will come, at any rate, when the <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> is done, or when you want the <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> back, or care in any way to come. &#x201C;Next week,&#x201D; so far as I remember, all evenings are alike.</p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>We are infinitely obliged by your Note: it shook away a considerable mass of darkness out of us; and is the most intelligible definite word we have yet heard on that sad subject.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s illness.</note> I got an ugly whiff of fright out of Venables&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Venables had accompanied Lady Ashburton to France in <date when="1857-10">Oct.</date>; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561024-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1856-10-24">24 Oct. 1856</date>]</ref>. He was present when &#x201C;a famous physician [Locock], who came from London to see her, declared that her case was hopeless&#x201D;; she had received the news with &#x201C;cheerful courage&#x201D; and had none of TC&#x2019;s doubts about the accuracy of the diagnosis. Venables later visited TC and confirmed the information he had already sent; he was &#x201C;surprised and interested by his refusal to believe the warnings. He burst out in a violent invective against the ill-boding physician, whom he declared to be the most incapable member of his profession.&#x201D; TC took &#x201C;the trouble to confirm his unfavourable judgment by a large collection of illustrative but doubtful facts. &#x2026; It was touching to observe Carlyle&#x2019;s determination to prove to himself rather than to me a foregone conclusion which he must have known to be unsound.&#x201D; He sent Lady Ashburton a report of the conversation, &#x201C;in just confidence that she would understand Carlyle&#x2019;s pathetic perversity.&#x201D; Lord Ashburton replied: &#x201C;she was delighted with Carlyle&#x2019;s new proof of affection, and that she had laughed with all her former heartiness at the form which his feelings had assumed&#x201D; (George Venables, &#x201C;Carlyle in Society and at Home,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review</hi> n.s. 33 [<date when="1884">1884</date>]: 636).</note> Letter and the other accounts, which, I know, was not without its basis and reasons alledgeable: nevertheless I have, after all the survey I can make, obstinately decided for confident hope,&#x2014;with or even against Locock<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Alledgeable&#x201C;: thus in MS.

<p>For one thing, I wish much my Lady and you were safe home again, with such health as there is: that clearly, so soon as the weather can permit, will be a great advantage to us all! We have Spring clearly prophecying itself now: frost and its muddy thaw all off; last monday I dated as the birthday of Spring, the skies and all earth and its winds indicating that glad fact. I was on the heights of Norwood, doing my sombre ride out there; and the universe seemed to rebuke such a mood: &#x201C;Fool, art thou not still in the Place of Hope?

I have breakfasted by myself for the last four months.&#x2014; Lady Sandwich too had become invisible, the last two times I called,&#x2014;both last week: &#x201C;a fit of cold,&#x201D; Miss Farrar<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Annie Farrer.</note> reports, who is assiduous, and gains admission; &#x201C;nothing more,&#x201D; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> we hope will now abate in the better weather.</p>

She had been very kind before; but with a patiently hopeless look, like a mourner standing by an unclosed grave. But all this had now passed away. All the blinds were drawn up in her house of mourning; her face was illuminated with the brightest of welcomes. I never knew any one who could deal out the flatteries so pleasantly and judiciously. I have seen it administered by the spoonful, like brimstone and treacle; and even laid on copiously, as if with a plasterer&#x2019;s trowel. But she knew better. She knew the sensitive points exactly; and, if she choose, could touch them so delicately, that it almost seemed like a happy inadvertence; and she could also prick them with the deftest of needles, if she saw fit. She expressed a good deal of bantering astonishment at, what she called &#x2018;my accurate knowledge of baby-linen&#x2019; [see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570204-TC-HL-01">TC to HL, <date when="1857-02-04">4 Feb.</date></ref>]; and was altogether cheerful and congratulatory&#x201D; (Larkin, <hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 36&#x2013;37).</note>&#x2014;&#x201C;sleeps <hi rend="italic">a little</hi>&#x201D; again, which is better than not at all; <pb id="pg-32-90" n="32:90"/>&#x26;c &#x26;c! She has had a sore imprisoned winter of it; but bears everything with much simplicity and quietness; and, I really think, has not been <hi rend="italic">the unhappier</hi> for her sufferings, perhaps even otherwise.&#x2014; I myself seem to feel a little better, since the Sun got visible again; there is a Spring-aspect traceable in fields and sky, which it does me good to see. My little <hi rend="italic">Horse,</hi> still more, seems delighted with the dry roads and improved outlooks; willing to canter mile on mile if I would permit:&#x2014;really a great help to me, this poor honest quadruped.</p>

We have understood that the opera was one of the chief charms of London social life, when English stiffness was somewhat thawed, the distinction of position modified, while at the same time all the finest passages of music were appreciated and enjoyed. But, according to Carlyle, whatever is is wrong: we wonder what he would have thought of the Bazaar of the Dumfries and Maxwelltown Mechanics Institute had he looked in at the George Street Assembly Rooms for an hour&#x2014;would he have deemed it a &#x2018;pious adventure&#x2019;?&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;in the Annual I believe it was <hi rend="italic">correctly</hi> printed: <pb id="pg-32-92" n="32:92"/>if your people have nothing but the Newspaper to go upon, it will nearly to a certainty be <hi rend="italic">in</hi>correct.

<p>Jane is slightly if at all better; has a heavy frequent (but not <hi rend="italic">deep</hi> or dangerous-<hi rend="italic">sounding</hi>) cough; can<supplied>[n]</supplied>ot<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted by TC.</note> attain to any moderate capability of sleeping;&#x2014;in short is very weak and feckless, tho&#x2019; not feverish or so miserable as you might fancy. I constantly hope she will rally soon now that the weather is changed for the better.</p>
<p>This ha<supplied>[s]</supplied> been a sad day with me,&#x2014;work altogether <hi rend="italic">spilt</hi> and gone to nothing: a day as if it had not been! I was in very bad fettle at starting; got into deeper and deeper confusion;&#x2014;finally took to horse, and rode away from it all, (by poor Jane&#x2019;s advice) into the mild spring Day taking the shortest &#x26; quietest road into Country region. After dinner and return, being very weary, I fell asleep; tea once done, I set out again, on foot, a considerable round of walking;&#x2014;and here I am, innocent of work for one day, and mournfully hoping tomorrow may be a little more propitious.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>My heart is dark about you and very sad. I cannot with the least certainty know how you are,&#x2014;who can? I keep asserting to myself that there is not the least evidence conclusive to me of real <hi rend="italic">danger:</hi> but it is too clear that you are in great suffering; oppressed probably with languors and sad dark thoughts and disquietudes: the beautiful bit of sunshine whither I always looked, this too is now sorrowfully gone into eclipse for the time. Alas, if prayers could avail, there are who would be diligent that way. But prayers cannot: what can we do? Silently continually go on with them, all the same.</p>
<p>My own private notion is, you probably got a great deal of mischief by your immense railway journeying. My own share of it, I know, hung palpably about me for weeks after; and it was but a poor tithe of yours. A great comfort to me always, too, is Rous.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Rouse.</note> Rous does not want for head; and he must <hi rend="italic">know</hi> the phenomenon, however he interpret it, at least 1000 times as well as Locock issuing from his express-train for one moment! I perceive, also, all Rous&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">interests</hi> are very peremptory in their admonition to him, Not to err on that side, of all sides. Rous&#x2019;s persistence is a strong fact to me. On the whole I do not allow myself the least wavering of Hope. I think all would be much better, moreover, if you were <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> under the fit power of sun; if we saw you with our eyes again!&#x2014; Lord A., for whose two Notes, the last of them this morning, I am very thankful,&#x2014;never gives the least hint on this point. From wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I infer that there is nothing yet in the least speakably decided about it.</p>
<p>We have got Spring back here; a better <date when="1857-02">february</date> at last than is usual. The sight of the young skies, of the dry fields, &#x2018;country people digging their gardens,&#x2019; with the poor birds singing round (I have heard thrushes in the <pb id="pg-32-94" n="32:94"/>Regent&#x2019;s Park<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The largest London park, about 2&#xBD; mi. N of Chelsea, designed by John Nash (<date when="1752">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835">1835</date>).</note> even),&#x2014;gives me a strange sombre joy. The eternal Opulence there is in this Universe, the silent prophecy written on Earth and Sky again, That this is &#x201C;the Place of Hope,&#x201D; touches my hard and stony heart, not to tears (these I think I shall never shed again) but to moods that are much better than my usual grim ones. The Spring is beautiful again; but the eyes that once saw it with me, where are they? One&#x2019;s own eyes get old, even they are not the same!&#x2014; Yesterday (it was a bright sunday afternoon, and I had been working to the edge of disgust in my Historical Quagmires) I rode out all round by Finchley, Hampstead &#x26;c,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both in N London.</note> thro&#x2019; half a million of sundry fellow-creatures:&#x2014;and was really thankful to my poor Horse, and the old Antediluvian Gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> that had conquered him for me out of the wild woods. If I had a Cow to feed me, as I have a Horse to carry, I should at least say, &#x201C;Here are two friends!&#x201D; The Cow, so far as my experience goes, is definable emphatically as the Friend of Man; and the French Cook as his Enemy. About the Horse and its qualities there can be no dissentience.</p>

<p>We are in a very weak way here. My poor Wife is still prisoner,&#x2014;getting slowly better, I persuade myself:&#x2014;she has been a model of patience all winter; that is one alleviation of the case.</p>
<p>Four or five days ago, Lady Sandwich when I called had bid them admit me.

You do well to write often,&#x2014; constantly.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Sandwich wrote often to Lady Ashburton at this time. On <date when="1857-01-02">2 Jan.</date>, she wrote: &#x201C;I am stunn&#x2019;d by your letter today my dearest dearest Harriet&#x2014; I had no conception you had been so ill and can&#x2019;t contemplate your serious illness&#x2014;away suffering you had been I knew but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is wide of thinking you would never see your home again do not write yourself my child but <hi rend="italic">pray</hi> I entreat of you to make Rouse send me a bulletin &#x2026; I am convinced the hills are not healthy. &#x2026; I am no Philosopher, but none of the people of the country ever lived in the heights in winter&#x2014;&#x26; there must have been a reason for it.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>However hurried, I ought to write you a word to quiet your anxieties wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I see you are beginning to entertain about our poor Patient here. She is really very weakly, and suffers and has suffered a great deal,&#x2014;coughing (frequent and irritative tho&#x2019; not deep), want of sleep (<hi rend="italic">always</hi> more or less, sometimes total), then want of strength, of appetite, and all manner of wants. She has really had a very sickly winter, and is weak and thin as you can suppose: but I have never been in serious alarm about her either, nor has she ever been,&#x2014;we trust always with confidence in &#x201C;the good weather,&#x201D; if it would but come. The other night (just about the time you wrote) she did thoroughly frighten Miss Jewsbury and the Maid,&#x2014;even I myself, more used to such phenomena, was not without qualms, so violent was the affair: a violent 3 or 4 hours of incessant retching (<hi rend="italic">without</hi> anything brought up), with spasms, nausea, and frightful pain;&#x2014;right glad we all were to see that terminate, and some sleep follow, about 2 in the morning!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellen Twisleton wrote, <date when="1857-03-04">4 March</date>: &#x201C;Saturday morning I went up to see Mrs Carlyle&#x2014;was met by Miss Jewsbury at the door, nearly crying, who described Mrs C&#x2019;s condition as so desperate, that if I had not got to the bottom of Miss Jewsbury, I believe I should have been frightened out of going up,&#x2014;however, up I went, &#x26; it ended by my taking her out for a sunny hour&#x2019;s drive in the Park;&#x2014;but she is very poorly, &#x26; much run down&#x201D; (Houghton 45M-98).</note> I hoped and tried to believe, all the while, it might be some <hi rend="italic">salutary</hi> clearing of the liver, and a crisis to the disorder: she is accordingly perceptibly better ever since; and I am again flattering myself we see land: but there is no counting in such cases! I have spoken to her more than once about sending for a Doctor; but she always pushes that away: and indeed it is too true I do not know any person here whose advice I could reckon certainly to be worth one doit in regard to such a case. So we keep hoping, and doing a very little <hi rend="italic">plain</hi> medicine, on our own score. This is a <hi rend="italic">true</hi> statement of the matter; about wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you need not alarm yourself: let us trust that before long I may be able to send you some better report.</p>
<p>For my own share I reckon myself to be obscurely yet perceptibly <hi rend="italic">improved</hi> from what I was. No man can <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> more diligently and regularly 2&#xBD; or <pb id="pg-32-97" n="32:97"/>3 hours every day (today I had a beautiful solitary canter in Richmond Park,&#x2014;6 miles away<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >SW of Chelsea and S of the Thames.</note>); I am perfectly <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> too, my whole industry (which alas is not great!) is directed on the horrible Job I have (by far the hatefullest and most disgustingly <foreign><hi rend="italic">fashous</hi></foreign> contemptible and difficult I ever was in): it goes on slower than <hi rend="italic">snails;</hi> but I do drive it, and will inch by inch <hi rend="italic">end</hi> it if I live!&#x2014; No more at present.

The attack on Canton, <date when="1856-10-27">27 Oct. 1856</date>, was in retaliation for the boarding of the lorcha, <hi rend="italic">Arrow,</hi> and the arrest of its crew by Chinese officials, because some of the crew were pirates. The <hi rend="italic">Arrow</hi> was not a British ship; though it had a British capt. and was flying the British flag, its registration had expired eight days earlier. Cobden argued that the British action was wholly illegal (<hi rend="italic">Hansard</hi> 144:1398&#x2013;1400). Palmerston accused him of being &#x201C;anti-English&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Hansard</hi> 144:1812). In the Commons vote, <date when="1857-03-03">3 March</date>, the govt. was narrowly defeated.

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>You are still far away from us; involved in clouds and uncertainties; nothing left for us amid the wide contradictory confusions but our own power of maintaining obstinate hope! I never before felt so sorrowfully the helplessness of human speech; the impossibility of gathering from these thick-coming rumours, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> vary every day, what one <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to think of a Fact unknown, and so terribly interesting to one. The contemptible babble that human creatures utter is hard to bear in such a case. I take the resource of shutting my ears to it; I think with myself, You know nothing of it, your good prognosis or your evil, please do not trouble me with it!&#x2014; On the whole all prophecies and accounts had assumed a favourable aspect of late: Venables called and comforted me much by his candid rational serious and hopeful account, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> brought many matters clear before. Lord A.&#x2019;s Notes too pray thank for them as they merit from me. The very tone of his voice is audible in them; and I can read many things by serious inspection of a line or two so true from the source as these are.&#x2014; We hear you are for moving homeward, &#x201C;to Paris in April&#x201D; if strength allow:&#x2014;God send you <hi rend="italic">here</hi> at your own house again, among your own friends again, that one might see you with eyes! The Spring is coming forward rapidly; fields already greenish in tinge, and trees themselves looking <hi rend="italic">vernal</hi> against the clear skies. I often see Addiscombe region from the distance: poor House and Gardens and all things there putting-on their best I doubt not; and beautiful as the world could shew,&#x2014;but alas the Lady, light of them all, is not there. Sometimes in <hi rend="italic">articulate</hi> moments one&#x2019;s thoughts are very poignant; but oftenest I am sunk into a gloomy frozen state wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> does not articulate itself at all, and is only more sad on that account. For the last year or two, especially in late months, I find myself grown strangely <hi rend="italic">old</hi>&#x2014;rapidly becoming <foreign><hi rend="italic">senex</hi></foreign> [old] and in fact become so, amid these chaotic waters of bitterness.</p>
<p>My Wife is still very poorly,&#x2014;has begun in the last few days to go driving out, if the sun and temperature favour; therefore may be judged to be again in the way of recovery: but she has <hi rend="italic">four months</hi> of sad leeway to make up. She is &#x26; has been very quiet and patient, with her sleeplessness, her coughings &#x26;c &#x26;c; which is the kindliest feature of her illness to me. Many people come to her in the forenoons (that is, more than <hi rend="italic">enough,</hi> tho&#x2019; at the maximum perhaps 3 or 2) when she is able to see people: I myself sit aloft here; see nobody&#x2014;but the ever-present face and doings of the Anarch Old.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chaos, see Milton, <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 2:988 and <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 3:113.</note> My labour disgusts me to the heart, and the result itself is unspeakably contemptible to <pb id="pg-32-99" n="32:99"/>me;&#x2014;no motive, only a dogged temper, to persevere. I had to send off my German galloway,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Martin.</note>&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;<foreign>Peesweep</foreign>&#x201C;</hi> (Scottice for <foreign>Pee-wit</foreign>) is now the definition I give myself of him; his intellect, assiduity, futility and general behaviour, some what resembling those of that ominous Bird.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign>Peesweep</foreign>,&#x201D; &#x201C;<foreign>peewit</foreign>,&#x201D; and &#x201C;<foreign>teewheet</foreign>&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570213-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1857-02-13">13 Feb.</date></ref>) are all Scots names for &#x201C;lapwing.&#x201D; John Leyden, in the glossary to his edn. of the anon. <hi rend="italic">Complaynt of Scotland</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1801">1801</date>), notes: &#x201C;In the south and west of Scotland, it is much detested, though not reckoned ominous.&#x201D; But he implied that an ominous reputation came from its &#x201C;haunts [being] frequently intruded upon by the fugitive Presbyterians, during the persecution which they suffered in the disgraceful and tyrannical reigns of Charles II. and James VII, when they were often discovered by the clamours of the lapwing&#x201D; (378). Leyden refers to the Covenanters, who objected to the imposition of Episcopalianism as the established religion of Scotland by Charles II; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450505-TC-DL-01"><sic>19:67</sic><corr>TC to DL, <date when="1845-05-05">5 May 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> He took to <hi rend="italic">whistling thro&#x2019; his nose</hi> as he breathed here in the cold weather: so I had to send him home for a working-place; calls here twice a day,&#x2014;and I cannot well pay him off (poor devil, so willing is he, and so resourceless) or I almost would. <hi rend="italic">Fried</hi>h was to be written with a <foreign>Peesweep</foreign> (&#x201C;<foreign>ki-bitz</foreign>&#x201D; they call it in German), and nothing better to help one forward; that also was in the fates!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are all fallen to daggers-drawn in the parliamentary regions, as you see; an &#x201C;election&#x201D; to be held straightway,&#x2014;and such a torrent of balderdash and worse poured out over the world as is painful to think of. People seem to prophecy that Palm<hi rend="italic">n</hi> will get a Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> more amenable to <hi rend="italic">him,</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Palmerston had called a general election rather than resign because he rightly sensed that he had the support of the country, if not parliament, in defending Sir John Bowring. At the election, <date when="1857-03-31">31 March</date>, he gained a majority of 85 seats, the largest majority for 26 years. Cobden (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570305-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1857-03-05">5 March</date></ref>) had been M.P. for the West Riding, Yorkshire, <date when="1847">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857">57</date>; as the W Riding voters disliked his policies on education and the Crimean War, he decided to stand for Huddersfield, hoping people there might be less antagonistic toward him; he lost, with 590 votes to 823. Although Palmerston won the election, many powerful people had misgivings about the action in China and the govt.&#x2019;s response (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570305-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1857-03-05">5 March</date></ref>). Lord Elgin, who was sent out to continue the war, wrote in his diary: &#x201C;I have hardly alluded in my ultimatum to that wretched question of the &#x2018;Arrow,&#x2019; which is a scandal to us, and is so considered, I have reason to know, by all except the few who are personally compromised&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals of James, Eighth Earl of Elgin,</hi> ed. Theodore Walrond [<date when="1872">1872</date>] 209). James Bruce (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863">63</date>; <ref target="volume-32/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3737"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 8th earl of Elgin. Lady Sandwich wrote to Lady Ashburton: &#x201C;There are so many people now in London who know every thing going on so much better than I do that I don&#x2019;t pretend to send you news. Sandwich [her son] &#x26; I fought yesterday morning about Palm &#x26; China&#x2014;have they told you the Registry of the Lorcha was expired 8 days &#x2026; when the Chinese invaded her&#x201D; (n.d.; MS: NLS Acc. 11388). John William Montagu, 7th earl of Sandwich.</note> and in itself a shade <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than any we have yet had.&#x2014; I cannot say I take any perceptible interest in <hi rend="italic">it.</hi> Me there are plenty of other things to interest!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Ought I to go at all upon this <hi rend="italic">Commission</hi> for the Nat<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Portrait Gallery; or w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> it be right to stay entirely away? If you were here I would ask; but alas, <pb id="pg-32-100" n="32:100"/>alas!&#x2014; &#x2014; Work at it I neither will nor can as matters stand with me; nay there was nobody ever asked my consent, or ever spoke of the matter to me; and I know not whence the thrice-profitable bit of promotion (my first in this world) can have come.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had presented Lord Ashburton in <date when="1853">1853</date> with a detailed proposal for a national portrait gallery; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530909-TC-RWE-01"><sic>28:264</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1853-09-09">9 Sept. 1853</date></corr></ref>. On <date when="1856-03-04">4 March 1856</date> the earl of Stanhope moved in the House of Lords that an address be presented to the queen for the establishment of &#x201C;a Gallery of the Portraits of the most eminent Persons in British History&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560305-TC-JRU-01"><sic>31:42</sic><corr>TC to JRU, <date when="1856-03-05">5 March 1856</date></corr></ref>). In his speech, Lord Stanhope quoted from TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Project of a National Exhibition of Scottish Portraits&#x201D; (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:404&#x2013;13 and <hi rend="italic">CL</hi> <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540502-TC-DL-01"><sic>29:75&#x2013;90</sic><corr>TC to DL, <date when="1854-05-02">2 May 1854</date></corr></ref>). His motion was unanimously supported, and the Commons passed the financial resolution <date when="1856-06-06">6 June 1856</date>, giving &#xa3;2,000 for a British historical portrait gallery (<hi rend="italic">Hansard</hi> 142:1124).

<salute>Dear Helps,</salute>
<p>I heartily congratulate you on getting so massive a new Piece of the Sysiphus Rock rolled up, and fairly laid at rest on the top of the hill!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Greek mythology, Sisyphus was punished in Hades by having to roll a boulder up a hill repeatedly, only to have it roll down again as soon as he reached the summit. Vol. 3 of Helps&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Spanish Conquest in America and Its Relation to the History of Slavery and to the Government of Colonies</hi> (<date when="1855">1855</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861">61</date>), 4 vols., covers the period from the conquest of Mexico in <date when="1521">1521</date> to the execution of the last independent Inca ruler, Atahuallpa, <date when="1533">1533</date>. Harshly critical of slavery in general, he especially condemned the Spanish for building palaces at Madrid and Toledo with money earned from &#x201C;duties on the importation of the negroes. &#x2026; [T]hese two palaces must be allowed to enjoy a remarkable preeminence as monuments of folly and oppression. Other buildings have been erected solely at the cost of the suffering subjects of great despots, or by prisoners captured in war. But the blood-cemented walls of the Alcazar of Madrid might boast of being raised upon a complication of human suffering hitherto unparalleled in the annals of mankind. The Indians had first to be removed by every kind of cruelty &#x2026; , and the Africans had to endure bloody wars in their own country before a sufficient number of them could be captured to meet the increasing demand for negro slaves. Each ducat spent upon these palaces was, at moderate computation, freighted with ten human lives&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Spanish Conquest</hi> [<date when="1856">1856</date>] 3:215&#x2013;16).

<p>Oh Heavens, yes certainly if I ever live across this horrid vortex of the jingling infinitude of Prussian sand and marine-stores (which fact seems often problematic to me), I do certainly intend to recreate myself at Vernon Hill:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helps&#x2019;s home in Hampshire, which TC had visited with Emerson, <date when="1848-07">July 1848</date>; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480706-TC-MAC-01"><sic>23:61</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1848-07-06">6 July 1848</date></corr></ref>.</note> but all that is yet&#x2014;God knows how far!</p>

<p><salute>Dear Sister,&#x2014;</salute>Lest I be disappointed today as I was yesterday, I will <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> this day by writing the poor word you affectionately request.</p>
<p>Jane is certainly not worse; I think her decidedly better ever since that bad fit which happened before my last writing,&#x2014;and indeed she herself cautiously admits as much. She sleeps perceptibly better,&#x2014;never one night absolutely without sleep;&#x2014;has a better appetite too (which indeed it was easy to have):&#x2014;in short I am again in hopes we have got over the hill; and that with the good weather in our favour, all will come right again before very long. She <pb id="pg-32-103" n="32:103"/>goes out every good day,&#x2014;not a walk yet, but a drive; either somebody taking her, or in a hired cab of her own, with Nero for company: poor little thing she has had a sad four months of it, &#x26; they are not <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> in our chronology.</p>
<p>As for myself I am sunk deep in wretchedness (owing to my <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> job &#x26;c &#x26;c), but feel withal as if any bodily health were <hi rend="italic">mending:</hi> that is in fact <hi rend="italic">nine-tenths</hi> of the battle too. Courage, courage!&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh</hi> will evidently never be asked for again: <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> it therefore with my blessing.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This may well be the copy that Ruskin had lent TC; Woolner reported that TC &#x201C;spoke with profound contempt of Ruskin because the little Art Deity called &#x2018;Aurora Leigh&#x2019; the finest poem by far of the present age and gave him a copy to read&#x201D; (see Wilson 5:297).

<p><salute>My dearest Mary&#x2014;</salute> &#x2026; If only you could get back your sleep, Darling! It is dreadful when sorrow<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the death of her father, Rev. Edward Dobbie, <date when="1857-02-22">22 Feb.</date></note> cannot have the relief which nature has appointed it in sleep, in forgetfulness, but must be endured by night as well as by day! and every sad image that presents itself is thrown out in such gigantic relief on the darkness, and made so haggard by bodily weariness! &#x2026; There is nothing I feel so much sympathy with as sleeplessness; for there is nothing I have suffered so much from myself. However kindly disposed one may be, it needs always that one should <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> another&#x2019;s trouble before one can rightly sympathise with it. My comfort about you is, that your Husband, besides being a kind Husband, is a skilful Doctor; and whatever can be done to overcome your wakefulness will assuredly be done. Do you know he has helped <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to get better sleep, by what he said when I was at Thornhill, about the injuriousness of Morphia, and such things. &#x2026; I have also abstained from something else Dr. Russell did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> prohibit, nay rather by example inculcated; I take no <hi rend="italic">tea,</hi>&#x2014;only what they call in Scotland &#x201C;content&#x201C;&#x2014;not even that quite, for I take milk and water without sugar. For the rest, I am decidedly recovering now. And even while your mind must needs be full of your own sad loss, I know you are unselfish enough and love me enough to be interested in what I write of myself, and glad that it is so favourable. I have been <pb id="pg-32-104" n="32:104"/>out four times in a carriage; and I feel stronger body and mind. The cough is not gone yet but there is no pain connected with it now; and it will need warmer weather to break the <hi rend="italic">habit</hi> of coughing. I was beginning to think with Dr. Russell that I had taken a too serious responsibility on myself in doctoring myself thro&#x2019; this last illness; but now I am glad, for any of these slapdash medical <hi rend="italic">eminences</hi> who had seen me a few weeks ago not knowing how many of the same sort of seizures I have weathered, would for certain have ordered me to Madeira, or the south of Italy,&#x2014;to the complete upsetting of one&#x2019;s domestic convenience, and the progress of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great!</hi> It is seventeen years now, since a Doctor Morrah,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Morrah.</note> who attended me here, in such another illness, told me I &#x201C;should never <hi rend="italic">live through another Winter in England!!</hi>&#x201D; He was a man of high reputation, whom I shouldn&#x2019;t have disliked having again, but he died soon after. Well, I resolved when the next Winter came, to stay and take my chance! and I have lived 19 Winters in England; and ten of them I have walked about in the coldest frosts, at the rate of six or ten miles a day! To be sure the Pitcher goes often to the well and gets broken at last.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> <hi rend="italic">This</hi> time again, however, the poor little brittle Pitcher will come back from the well whole, I think; or with only a little crack in it. And cracked things often hold as long as whole things,&#x2014;one takes so much better care of them.</p>
<p>The last two or three days, I have been more anxious about my maid than about myself; she has excellent health; has not been an hour unable for her work since she came to us three and a half years ago! But the other day she cut her finger severely; did not come to tell me, but fussed on with it herself; and it bled half a pint, and was badly wrapped up; and kept her awake all the night after, with the pain of it. To which I impute the billious attack she had the next day. She is going about again now quite well, only a little weak; but for three days I had two strangers,&#x2014;that is to say, <hi rend="italic">new hands</hi> in the house (I have one of them still), to fill her <hi rend="italic">one</hi> place&#x2014;and so inadequately! And I had to wait on <hi rend="italic">her</hi> myself, instead of being waited on.</p>
<p>I must tell you an instance of Ann&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">gentility</hi>: it was in shaving a <hi rend="italic">bath-brick</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An unbaked brick used for scouring and polishing metals.</note> that she cut her finger. To-day when she opened the door to the Lady Alice Hill<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alice Maria (<date when="1842">1842</date>&#x2013;<date when="1928">1928</date>).</note> (a lovely girl whom Ann <hi rend="italic">respects</hi> very much as the Daughter of a real live Marchioness),<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caroline Frances, marchioness of Downshire.</note> Lady Alice, who is the most bewitching little monkey in the world, said, &#x201C;Oh Ann, what ails your hand?&#x201D; &#x201C;I have cut it, my Lady.&#x201D; &#x201C;How did you cut it?&#x201D; &#x201C;Well, I did it in cutting up a&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">fowl!!</hi>&#x201D; She told me this substitution herself. &#x201C;You know Ma&#x2019;am,&#x201D; said she, in telling of Lady Alice&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-32-105" n="32:105"/>kind enquiries, &#x201C;I couldn&#x2019;t go and say to a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> young Lady that I did it cutting a <hi rend="italic">bath-brick! that</hi> sounded <hi rend="italic">so common!</hi> I thought a <hi rend="italic">fowl</hi> was more the thing!!&#x201D;</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have no doubt you have done with those <hi rend="italic">Biographies;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Schiller and John Sterling; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570130-TC-HL-01">TC to HL, <date when="1857-01-30">30 Jan.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570204-TC-HL-01"><date when="1857-02-04">4 Feb.</date></ref></note> nor are they yet wanted,&#x2014;but they will be, infallibly, in four weeks hence, they and the <hi rend="italic">sequel</hi> to them; which latter is still <foreign><hi rend="italic">in nubibus</hi></foreign> [in the clouds], and begins to look dangerous to me!</p>
<p>I think it ought to be the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays,</hi> 4 vols. (Boston, <date when="1838">1838</date>; London, <date when="1839">1839</date>); 2d edn., 5 vols. (<date when="1840">1840</date>); 3d edn., 4 vols. (<date when="1847">1847</date>).</note> which will need some little shifting (I believe) in some of the outskirts (change of Appendix into Text &#x26;c), and especially will need <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> well done.</p>
<p>Will you be so kind as consider <hi rend="italic">practically</hi> what you could do, and what you would like to do, in that matter; then bring me the Sterling (so soon as ready) any evening; and let us decide something about that other matter. If you find yourself unequal or unenclined<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> to the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies,</hi> I have another offer for that (unexceptionable, save that I shall have <hi rend="italic">too much talk</hi> upon it; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a serious fault,&#x2014;wool, and not <hi rend="italic">cry,</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;All cry and no wool,&#x201D; proverbial; i.e., a lot of noise and nothing to show for it.</note> being the matter in quest!)&#x2014;and in case of the worst, we can get plenty of <hi rend="italic">other</hi> work to hold your helpful hand in use.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin wrote: &#x201C;I responded heartily to this summons; &#x2026; [M]y visits became less formal, and were entirely pleasant and encouraging. Mrs. Carlyle and I seemed to get on very happily together. She said, she didn&#x2019;t see why Carlyle &#x2026; should have me all to himself; and enlisted my services in many little practical difficulties of her own. She once, in those early days, told me, in her pleasant, half-flattering, half-bantering way, that I was &#x2018;the only one she had ever heard Carlyle speak of, without what Sir Robert Peel would call &#x201C;mitigating circumstances&#x201D;!&#x2019; &#x201D; Soon after Larkin sent TC an essay, &#x201C;The Poetry of Life,&#x201D; expressing his notion of &#x201C;the Christian ideal.&#x201D; When he next visited, TC and JWC were strangely silent: &#x201C;[T]hey must already have looked on me as a kind of feeble Irving; with much of his spirit of willing helpfulness; but utterly without his great gifts, for which perhaps chiefly they had both admired him. I have no doubt they were sincerely grieved at the thought, that here was another earnest life brought close to them, equally bound to be wrecked in the vain struggle after the impossible and unattainable&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 37&#x2013;38). Larkin himself believed that TC &#x201C;had an inarticulate belief in the infinitely just &#x2018;Most High God&#x2019; &#x2026; and, if it does not reach to the clear heaven of Christian love and self-devotion, it is at least their everlasting basis&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle and the Open Secret of His Life</hi> [<date when="1886">1886</date>] 355).</note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother</salute>
<p>We are always in considerable confusion here, sometimes in considerable distress, or I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have written to you sooner. Poor Jane does not get better: she has twice been evidently on the recovering hand, but has both times (the first time very badly) <hi rend="italic">relapsed:</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570305-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1857-01-05">5 March</date></ref>.</note> she is now on the second recovery (I at last hope) from a slighter check she had about a week ago. Nothing <hi rend="italic">serious</hi> seems to me to be wrong; the cough, tho&#x2019; teasing and violent, has a <hi rend="italic">superficial</hi> quality, I always flatter myself. But five months of pining and confinement,&#x2014;want of sleep sometimes total, and always partial; rare access to the free air, &#x26;c &#x26;c: all this is very bad. We have never had a Doctor, neither of us knowing of any in the least likely to <hi rend="italic">help,</hi> had our anxiety to have one been greater: sometimes, in bad moments, I think there ought to be one,&#x2014;she also, I can now see, is occasionally disheartened, but only occasionally. On the whole if you happen to know of anybody, give us his name. Small <hi rend="italic">help</hi> to be found that way, if one have not special guidance! Locock went to Nice,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570212-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1857-02-12">12 Feb.</date></ref></note> pocketed his &#xa3;1,000 (a nice fee for one day),&#x2014;and, I seriously believe, did nothing but ill,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">confirmed</hi> all that the Family Dr<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Rouse.</note> said, and expressed <hi rend="italic">terror</hi> over it, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the F<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Dr refused and refuses to entertain;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; matters wear a very sickly aspect there Locock &#x201C;has made <hi rend="italic">a cure</hi>&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c. One rather feels as if a horsewhipping were not inappropriate to such a <hi rend="italic">curative</hi> process.</p>
<p>I have put away &#x201C;<foreign>Peesweep</foreign>,&#x201C;&#x2014;such was the title of unfortunate Wagner-Martin in late weeks; title rather descriptive of him. He was unhappy, and the cause of more unhappiness. Like to drive me distracted, sometimes, with his hysterical futilities,&#x2014;poor soul. The &#x2018;whistling thro&#x2019; the nose&#x2019; (in breathing in cold weather) made me send him home &#x201C;to work&#x201D;; at home or at the Museum, he was futile, <hi rend="italic">chaotic</hi> not cosmic: &#x201C;too weak for the place.&#x201D; I got on perceptibly better since his unbeautiful face was veiled from me. Poor soul, we shall have a bout still before there can be some new outlet found for him. But his &#x201C;help&#x201D; I will have no more of, whatever come.</p>

<p>Jane complains of toothache, as an addition, this afternoon; has had to get chloroform &#x26;c: poor soul she had little or no sleep last night; and has been a shade worse all day, but I trust it is not a relapse again. She absolutely has not stirred from the warm rooms.

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>I have had two little Bulletins, the second more reassuring, tho&#x2019; both are of rather uncertain complexion:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Stanley wrote to his wife, <date when="1857-03-21">21 March</date>: &#x201C;I am sorry to say the accounts of Lady Ashburton are worse, the remedies have ceased to have effect, more water is forming &#x26; her debility increases. I fear her case is most dangerous&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">The Stanleys of Alderley,</hi> ed. Nancy Mitford [<date when="1939">1939</date>] 173).</note> many thanks to Lord A<hi rend="italic">n.</hi> for his friendly pains. Alas, I have nothing for it but to listen to the dim oracles; and refuse to be disheartened the best I may. You are clearly in much pain and depression; that, alas, I can by no means deny to myself. That I think enough <hi rend="italic">for admitting;</hi> that is all I will admit, or have admitted. If they are giving you mercury (as I may conjecture), experience sufficiently teaches me the tearing wasting effects of that potent drug; and above all, its terrible effect on the spirits Never mind it,&#x2014;if you only <hi rend="italic">could</hi> never, or ever! One cannot help its harassing influence,&#x2014;no strength of soul can;&#x2014;but its effects are powerful for good too, I suppose beyond all other medicine in that respect.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was widely believed that mercury, particularly in the form of the &#x201C;blue pill,&#x201D; was an effective treatment against mental and nervous illness. The American physician Benjamin Rush (<date when="1745">1745</date>&#x2013;<date when="1813">1813</date>) wrote in <date when="1812">1812</date> that mercury &#x201C;stimulates every part of the body &#x2026; conveys morbid action out of the body by the mouth, and thus restores the mind to its native seat in the brain&#x201D; (quot. Janet Oppenheim, <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Shattered Nerves&#x201C;: Doctors, Patients, and Depression in Victorian England</hi> [Oxford, <date when="1991">1991</date>] 113).</note> &#x201C;An electrified Cat&#x201C;&#x2014;I remember that was once a similitude of yours, for the state of nerves it (or some other cause) can produce on one&#x2019;s nervous-system. Be not discouraged; be ready at <date when="1857-04">mid-April</date>: we shall think you almost <hi rend="italic">here</hi> when once you are in Paris. I hear your House there is one of the finest possible for what you want with it.</p>
<p>We have had a week or more of the most supremely virulent March weather,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> fit, we may hope:&#x2014;today the Sun has come out, and the East-wind gone down: a large fall of rain is now due, and we shall be into <date when="1857-04">April</date> with its green things and its flowers.</p>
<p>Poor Jane is still prisoner; she caught new cold, venturing out too rashly;&#x2014;staid punctually within heated rooms, during this last bout; and will not venture out even today. I think she is clearly getting better; and approve of <pb id="pg-32-112" n="32:112"/>the caution she uses, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> cannot be too punctilious after such an experience. Five months now since I have seen her out to breakfast.&#x2014; In fact these are heavy times to me, and to some others of us, in all manner of ways. The Scotch have a Proverb wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I often remember, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Jook</hi></foreign> (duck) and let the <hi rend="italic">jaw</hi> go by (<hi rend="italic">jaw</hi> is &#x2018;sudden-torrent,&#x2019; &#x2018;wave&#x2019; such as one finds in sea-bathing in rough weather): &#x201C;jook and let the jaw go by.&#x201C;&#x2014; Yes, do; you also, dear Lady Sufferer; the <hi rend="italic">waves</hi> and &#x201C;jaws&#x201D; do all go by; and better times come, one <hi rend="italic">can</hi> hope!&#x2014;</p>

It is frightful to think what torrents of balderdash will be emitted, and what a pack of scurvy hounds will be at last returned, as &#x201C;Collective Folly of the Nation,&#x201C;&#x2014;for really that is now coming to be definition of it more and more.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You would oblige me very much if, in your Antiquarian Society<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Soc. of Antiquaries of Scotland.</note> or otherwise, you could procure me a Copy of that <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> I once wrote to you (and <hi rend="italic">read</hi> in a very correctly printed state) about the Scottish <hi rend="italic">Exhibition of Historical Portraits.</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1854-05-03">3 May 1854</date>, see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540503-TC-DL-01"><sic>29:84&#x2013;90</sic><corr>TC to DL, <date when="1854-05-03">3 May 1854</date></corr></ref>; see also <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540502-TC-DL-01"><sic>29:75</sic><corr>TC to DL, <date when="1854-05-02">2 May 1854</date></corr></ref>; it was printed in <date when="1855">1855</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550520-TC-DL-01"><sic>29:314</sic><corr>TC to DL, <date when="1855-05-20">20 May 1855</date></corr></ref>. For the letter, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:404&#x2013;13.</note> I got 5 or 6 copies of it from you, and sent them about; one (incorporated in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi>) I kept for myself: but a kind of semi-official amateur<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified; not Lord Stanhope as he apparently had his own copy, presumably sent to him by TC; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551020-TC-JN-01"><sic>30:84</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1855-10-20">20 Oct. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> has <hi rend="italic">borrowed</hi> it from me almost two years ago; and now when I want it very much (for printing in certain &#x201C;Miscellanies&#x201D; of mine, which are going to press),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The cheap edition of <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays,</hi> 4 vols., was pbd. <date when="1857-08">Aug.</date> to <date when="1857-10">Oct.</date>; &#x201C;Project of a National Exhibition of Scottish Portraits&#x201D; was 4:330&#x2013;37.</note> my Amateur &#x201C;has never received it,&#x201C;&#x2014;Post-Office must have lost it, for it went by post! Lost it sure enough is; and I have no resource but to apply to you.</p>
<p>If you could cut out the leaf or two, occupied by the <hi rend="italic">Letter,</hi> in the little Pamphlet of <hi rend="italic">Transactions;</hi> and mark for me on the margin the correct <hi rend="italic">Title</hi> of that Pamphlet (<hi rend="italic">year</hi> and place Edin<hi rend="italic">r!</hi> included), it would come more easily and safely to hand, and there w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be nothing more wanted for my present objects.</p>
<p>If you cannot possibly get the thing for me in this or some other easy way, <pb id="pg-32-114" n="32:114"/>have the goodness to let me know directly, and I will contrive some other effort. But I hope it will be possible for you.</p>
<p>We have got a thing called &#x201C;National Portrait Commission&#x201D; here; but that need not slacken your Scottish efforts, if there ever were any:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Scottish National Portrait Gallery opened in <date when="1889">1889</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540503-TC-DL-01"><sic>29:90</sic><corr>TC to DL, <date when="1854-05-03">3 May 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;I reckon it may be a very long time indeed before there be a &#x201C;Gallery&#x201D; got together by the present hands and methods! I am extremely occupied, and in the most miserable manner I have heretofore ever had experience of,&#x2014;nigh choked, soul and body, in beggarly whirlwinds of Prussian <hi rend="italic">sand!</hi></p>
<p>No more therefore at present.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Neuberg,&#x2014;</salute>You are evidently taking far too much pains with that imbroglio of Scrawlings. I merely wanted you to run over the masses with your fresh (undigusted)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> eye; to judge what passages were worth the <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> implied in having them copied by Wagner;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Martin.</note> to mark with a pencil stroke on the margin what he was to copy,&#x2014;and send him home to do it.

But we will be patient: I do myself immeasurable mischief by the want of that virtue. No use asking Wagner what has become of the George II things: he will &#x2018;drop a tear over <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>&#x2019; (a very bad habit!)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to Martin&#x2019;s habit of sniffing continuously; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561210-JWC-IC-01">JWC to IC, [ca. <date when="1856-12-10">10 Dec. 1856</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;and that is all we shall get.</p>

Neuberg replied, <date when="1857-05-18">18 May</date>: &#x201C;The Author of the life of &#x2018;Prinz Heinrich,&#x2019; as well as of the little Books on Ziethen, &#x26; Old Dessauer, (Decker writes) is <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von B&#xfc;low,</hi> Brother of the &#x2018;General,&#x2019; him &#x2018;of Dennewitz,&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">whose</hi> life, by Varnhagen, you know. I remember in Varnhagen&#x2019;s Book some mention of an eccentric clever Brother, who wrote very sharp military criticisms on the then Pruss<hi rend="italic">n.</hi> affairs &#x2026; for which he got imprisoned, and if I remember rightly <hi rend="italic">died</hi> in prison. &#x2026; The &#x2018;Ziethen,&#x2019; and &#x2018;Dessauer&#x2019; &#x2026; are out of a biographical &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Sammelwerk,</hi>&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">titlepage</hi> &#x2018;which probably had an engraving on it,&#x2019; was missing.&#x201D; TC&#x2019;s copies of Adam Heinrich Dietrich von B&#xfc;low, <hi rend="italic">Prinz Heinrich von Preussen.

TC wrote on the flyleaf of the book that it had been given him by Guido von Usedom: &#x201C;His book is full of a certain talent, &#x26; real opulence of mind; but is defaced by sediments of imperfect moral qualities (pride, anger, vainglory too traceable in it, tho&#x2019; well varnished over), which considerably pervert (as one may well see) the conclusions he arrives at &#x2026; <hi rend="italic">Scepticism</hi> (in war itself, much more on all other &#x2018;arts&#x2019; &#x26; subjects), this, with a dash of revolutionary sentimentalism, may be described as the result he has finally come to.

I read him with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> disgust,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; slowly, his <hi rend="italic">style</hi> too partaking of his temper, and being dreadfully screwed and twisted.

<salute>My dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I want very much to know about your sleep? Dont plague yourself to write a letter while you have not spirits for it; but do send me just two lines to say if you have broken thro&#x2019; that miserable habit of awaking in the early morning. I never lie awake all night myself, without thinking of you, with such sympathy as only comes thro experience. Considering that I still keep the house, my own sleep is rather improved. Only if anything have worried me during the day. I have a wakeful night, and <hi rend="italic">one</hi> brings another. Last week M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle startled me one evening with a project of going off to Germany, so soon as he had finished the second volume of his book, and writing the other two volumes there!&#x2014; I was to go with him; and he calculated on my long-ago strength and activity and ingenuity, to shelter him from the disagreeables of a strange country, and surround him with a <hi rend="italic">scotch home</hi> in the middle of german curtainless beds, and german stoves, and german devil-knows-what-all!&#x2014; &#x201C;So you see my Dear,&#x201D; he concluded, &#x201C;you must <hi rend="italic">make haste and get well,</hi> for you will have plenty to <hi rend="italic">do,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">scheme out</hi>&#x201D;!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Now all that talk <hi rend="italic">might</hi> never get further than <hi rend="italic">talk</hi>&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C propounds many such projects that come to nothing, beyond the worry of the moment&#x2014; Still this one <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be carried out! and the bare idea of it in my actual state of nerves and bodily inability made me <hi rend="italic">like to scream!</hi> Four bad nights were the result!</p>
<p>No more has been said about Germany since the day after the first declaration of his scheme. Then, he merely said; &#x201C;How will you like going to live in Germany do you think?&#x201C;&#x2014; I said very quietly; &#x201C;I dont think the present is a favourable time for your asking the question, or for my answering it. When one is confined to two rooms with so bad a cold one has little spirit left for new adventures especially when they involve bodily fatigue&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;True&#x201D; he said&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">you</hi> must of course get well first of all.&#x201C;&#x2014; Since that the subject has <pb id="pg-32-118" n="32:118"/>been let drop&#x2014;and I trust in Heaven it may not be returned to&#x2014; If he would only go and write the rest of his book in Scotland!&#x2014; But there would be no &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">facilities</hi>&#x201D; there!</p>
<p>It is beautiful warm air the last two days; and I should have gone out at last, but for the constant showers&#x2014;making every thing so damp&#x2014; Since I kept my two rooms my cough has been gradually going off&#x2014;and my strength returning&#x2014; It would be a pity to run the risk of more relapses for the sake of getting <hi rend="italic">about</hi> a few days sooner<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne Procter wrote about this time to William Brookfield, who had recently returned with his family from traveling in Europe: &#x201C;I am very glad you have come home again. To find Mrs. Carlyle, I fear, seriously ill&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Brookfield</hi> 2:453).</note></p>
<p>The last accounts of Lady Ashburton were very favourable&#x2014; She had been suffering so much from Locock&#x2019;s medecines that she positively refused to go on with them, and sent for the Physician (Russian) of the Empress of Russia<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria Alexandrovna, of Hesse-Darmstadt (<date when="1824">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880">80</date>), m., <date when="1841">1841</date>, to Tsar Alexander II (<date when="1818">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881">81</date>). One of the tsarist family&#x2019;s personal doctors was S. P. Botkin (<date when="1832">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889">89</date>), but it is not known when he began this role.</note> (also at Nice for her health) <hi rend="italic">He</hi> entirely disagreed with Lococks view of her case&#x2014;desired her to give up all medecine entirely&#x2014;and she was rapidly recovering her strength and spirits, on a diet of &#x201C;skimmed milk, a little bread, and <hi rend="italic">salt herring</hi>&#x201D;!!! She was driving out, and meant to come to Paris in a week or so&#x2014;where they have taken a fine house (a thousand pounds for two months of it!!) and after that, she thinks of going to Carlsbad<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spa town in western Bohemia, now the Czech Republic, 116 mi. W of Prague.</note>&#x2014; Why she never thinks of coming to her own beautiful Place in Hampshire<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Grange.</note> I cant understand!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You will have heard of my cousin Jeanie&#x2019;s baby<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Chrystal.</note>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">all right</hi>&#x2014; I hope she will now at least turn to <hi rend="italic">dressing it</hi> instead of herself.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>We hear cheering accounts of you; vague, but all favourable, and more or less agreeing with Lord A<hi rend="italic">n&#x2019;s</hi> last note; which are a great comfort, <pb id="pg-32-119" n="32:119"/>you may believe! Today Miss Farrar reported to my Wife, that you are out of the severe treatments altogether, living on milk diet; perhaps on the road to Paris by this time:&#x2014;Would to Heaven we could believe all that! We can hope at any rate; we have always refused not to hope.</p>
<p>The <date when="1857-04">April</date> weather is miraculously warm here; much rain, but a temperature equal to the end of <date when="1857-05">May</date>; and westerly winds, when dry as they are from time to time, altogether wholesome and pleasant. Might they but bring you home to us soon. Once at Paris, you will seem to us next door to home; within a day,&#x2014;fully nearer for a Letter than my Scotch Border is;&#x2014;almost looking over into your old haunts here. Bath House<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons&#x2019; London home, at the corner of Piccadilly and Bolton St.; see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:200</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10-22">22 Oct. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> is vacant, but safe and ready; how ready w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> it and other objects be for you!&#x2014;</p>
<p>As for myself I am not prosperous; have been less so for a fortnight past than usual; and oftenest very dark indeed. The truth is, I am fallen extremely <hi rend="italic">weak</hi> (I did not know how weak), and have more laid on me than I can well travel with at times. A sad business that I ever undertook that <hi rend="italic">Fried</hi>h: what had I to do with it? I am not fit for such an unutterable mass of confusions, difficulties, disgusts and ineptitudes; should have been 20 years <hi rend="italic">younger;</hi> should have put myself under <hi rend="italic">Tom Crib</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom Cribb (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">1848</date>), English bare-knuckle boxing champion.</note> first, to get into condition. My case is very bad;&#x2014;and I find there is only one remedy, To get the thing <hi rend="italic">done,</hi> were it only at the rate of an inch a-day!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My Wife continues rather improving; but is still weak as possible;&#x2014;very cautious, this time, of not getting new cold; has only been twice out, in spite of the tempting glimpses of weather. Today indeed she narrowly escaped rain, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> now continues.&#x2014; I find I have ridden <hi rend="italic">too</hi> diligently; so the oracles plainly sing, much to my sorrow: one cannot <hi rend="italic">force</hi> back lost health by vigour in riding. I must have done about 1,500 miles already: but am now ordered to take it more moderately; and keep an eye on other Laws too. One does not know one&#x2019;s limits; and one should, and must!&#x2014;</p>
<p>A Daydream of mine is, To see you quiet, well and solitary at The Grange once more,&#x2014;all Highland wildernesses and wild things and journeyings given up; a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">practical school</hi>&#x201D; for girls, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> for boys (difficult exceedingly, important exceedingly) occupy the Lady and the Lord, supply them with a generous interest;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both Ashburtons had a long-standing interest in education. Lord Ashburton was the proprietor of Brown Candover Parochial School, Hampshire, and had agreed with the Committee of Council on Education in <date when="1851">1851</date> that the premises would be used without interruption for the education of the poor, access being given to inspectors of schools, in exchange for a parliamentary grant for the payment of stipends to pupil teachers (Hampshire Records Office, 80M 70 S3). Philip W. Stockman, of Fareham School, Hampshire, complained to Lord Ashburton, <date when="1855-07-31">31 July 1855</date>, that because of the latter&#x2019;s generous subsidies to the Candover school the master there charged fees so low that Stockman could not compete: &#x201C;I know your lordship too well as a philanthropist, and schoolmaster&#x2019;s staunch friend to believe that you will suffer my case to pass unheeded&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388). In <date when="1859">1859</date>, Ashburton was to build the Grange Church of England School on Northington Hill in Hampshire (Hampshire Record Office TOP237/1/3). There is no evidence that the Ashburtons ever set up a girls&#x2019; school or were interested in the day-to-day running of the schools, though Brookfield wrote to Lady Ashburton in <date when="1852">1852</date> about &#x201C;[n]o instructions&#x201D; having been issued for &#x201C;a visit to your school with reference to Augmentation of your Damsel&#x2019;s salary&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388), and Lord Ashburton appears to have been interested in the appointment of teachers: &#x201C;I saw the new schoolmistress in London &#x26; liked her appearance. She is very young to exercise authority but not younger than Miss Lee&#x201D; (n.d.; NLS Acc. 11388).

A Conservative who supported Palmerston in his disapproval of the secret ballot, Cadogan saw no harm in a &#x201C;moderate&#x201D; extension of the franchise but was against the admission of Jews to Parliament. At a meeting in his committee rooms, <date when="1857-04-04">4 April</date>, a motion was passed that &#x201C;in the judgment of this meeting the public opinions of Lord Chelsea are opposed to political and social improvement, and that he is not therefore qualified to represent the county of Middlesex&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi> <date when="1857-04-06">6 April</date>).</note> &#x201C;Lord Chelsea nowhere,&#x201D; they told me, Brewer Hanbury preferred to him; and at the top of the poll Ld.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I had lost your Letter till this morning.</p>
<p>Being extremely occupied at this time, and not calculating that I can do any good at the London Library, I decided to leave this Election altogether alone;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Bodham Donne had resigned; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570321-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1857-03-21">21 March</date></ref>. An advert. for his replacement appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> <date when="1857-04-04">4 April</date>, applications to be sent to Donne.</note> and shall probably not be in a Committee meeting at all till after this matter is ended. I went one afternoon, some weeks since, to reinforce a small minority there was, who pleaded that <hi rend="italic">Bibliographic</hi> Accomplishments, as we had found by sad experience since the loss of poor Cochrane,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John George Cochrane (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852">1852</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401207-TC-WDC-01"><sic>12:346</sic><corr>TC to WDC, <date when="1840-12-07">7 Dec. 1840</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520424-TC-LOL-01"><sic>27:93</sic><corr>TC to LOL, <date when="1852-04-24">24 April 1852</date></corr></ref>), first librarian, <date when="1841">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852">52</date>.</note> were to all appearance a quality that did not really exist among Candidates (perhaps was extinct in the British Nation at present); that we ought to be content with a certain <hi rend="italic">Sub</hi>librarian we have at present, who is an excellent methodic, industrious goodnatured man, and knows the London Library by heart;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Edward Jones applied for the post but was unsuccessful; he had also been unsuccessful in <date when="1852">1852</date> when Donne got the post; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520614-TC-JAC-01"><sic>27:144&#x2013;46</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1852-06-14">14 June 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and give <pb id="pg-32-122" n="32:122"/>up the idea of fishing out a real &#x201C;Librarian&#x201D; from the miscellany of the Public, till we incidentally might notice some symptom of one. This idea was not relished by the majority (among individuals of whom I could privately trace some decisive expectations directed upon yourself);&#x2014;so that my whole work being done in the business, I had only to return home, and leave it till finished.</p>
<p>To several of your qualities, extant in a superior degree, I can myself bear witness; and it is possible, probable, the majority of the Committee will not have so strict notions of what a &#x201C;knowledge of Books&#x201D; means as I have;&#x2014;at all events, I can well believe you are probably <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> in this respect also to anything that will offer. So that I should say your chance on the whole seems good; and I believe I may promise farther that the Committee will decide <hi rend="italic">bon&#xe2; fide</hi> upon such evidence of fitness as they may get,&#x2014;and certainly without prejudice <hi rend="italic">again<supplied>[st]</supplied></hi> you, so far as I could gather that day.</p>
<p>I can only therefore encourage you to do your best in the way of shewing what you <hi rend="italic">are;</hi> and shall hope (and believe, of you more than of another) that whatever you may want of Bibliography &#x26;c on entering on your Office, you will steadily go on <hi rend="italic">acquiring</hi> till you are perfect in it. <closer><salute>With many good wishes&#x2014; Yours Sincerely,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>If you ever want Copyists at the Museum, I think the Bearer of this, Mr Martin, whose qualifications are practically known to me by five months experience, would be very likely to suit beyond common.</p>
<p>He writes an excellent legible hand, <hi rend="italic">German</hi> or English; has some academic culture, considerable sharpness of perception; knows German (which is his native language) in every minutest particular; French also to a high degree of exactitude, by long residence in that country; of his English, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he writes fully as well as he speaks, you can yourself judge.</p>
<p>He has served me five months; and I can bear witness to his very great diligence, punctuality, and general desire to be useful.</p>
<p>If you could direct him in any way how to set about getting into some subaltern employment among the numerous people whom I suppose to be working at the Catalogue, or otherwise doing Copyist work, you would not <pb id="pg-32-123" n="32:123"/>only much oblige me (which you are ever ready to do), but I am persuaded you would do a service both to the work on hand and to a meritorious man who is at present out of work.

<salute>My Dear Madam,&#x2014;</salute>
<p>Last night I received a Gift<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hugh Miller, <hi rend="italic">The Testimony of the Rocks; or Geology in its Bearings on the Two Theologies, Natural and Revealed</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1857">1857</date>).</note> of your sending, which is at once very precious and very mournful to me.</p>
<p>There is for ever connected with the very title of this Book the fact that, in writing it, the cordage of a strong heart cracked in pieces; that the ink of it is a brave man&#x2019;s life blood!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Miller committed suicide as soon as he had finished his work on the book, apparently spending his last day reading the proofs; see also <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561228-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1856-12-28">28 Dec. 1856</date></ref>. The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> <date when="1857-04-04">4 April</date>, reviewed <hi rend="italic">Testimony of Rocks:</hi> &#x201C;The close of the work and the death of its writer occurring so closely together have led to the very general inference, that the production of this work led to that overwrought state of mind of the author which led to his destruction. &#x2026; [I]n no portion of it do we find evidence of labour such as would break down a mind like that possessed by Hugh Miller&#x201D; (429).</note> The Book itself, I already see, is full of grave, manly talent, clearness, eloquence, faithful conviction, inquiry, knowledge; and will teach me and others much in reading it:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote at the end of the table of contents of his copy: &#x201C;To p. 152 extremely well worth reading; mostly <hi rend="italic">skip</hi>pable after that&#x2014; Send it to Js Aitken Dumfries, when done with; everybody to take good care of the poor <hi rend="italic">volume,</hi> there being a special interest in it&#x201D; (vi). The section of the book approved of by TC is concerned mainly with paleontology and geology. The rest of the book, except for the last two lectures on Scottish fossil flora, is Miller&#x2019;s attempt to reconcile the Mosaic with the geological record of creation: &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">days</hi> of the Mosaic account were great periods, not natural days&#x201D;; he concludes that the &#x201C;long ascending line from dead matter to man has been a progress Godwards &#x2026; destined from the beginning to furnish a point of union; and, occupying that point as true God and true man,&#x2014;as Creator and created,&#x2014;we recognise the adorable Monarch of all the future!&#x201D; (152, 156). TC comments here: &#x201C;very idle work, all <hi rend="italic">this!</hi>&#x201D; At the beginning of the fifth lecture, &#x201C;Geology in its bearings on the two theologies,&#x201D; Miller maintains that the &#x201C;science of the geologist seems destined to exert a marked influence on that of the natural theologian&#x201D; to which TC responds: &#x201C;Try again!&#x201D; (172). On Miller&#x2019;s analysis of the &#x201C;Noachian Deluge,&#x201D; TC comments: &#x201C;dreadfully wearisome stuff!&#x201D; (305). TC&#x2019;s copy: Strouse.</note> but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is already an extrinsic act <pb id="pg-32-128" n="32:128"/>which will give it a double significance to us all. For myself, a voice of friendly recognition from such a man,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably referring to Lydia Miller&#x2019;s inscription on the flyleaf, &#x201C;To / Thomas Carlyle Esq. / from Mrs Hugh Miller / By the Express Desire of Her / Late Husband,&#x201D; or to the passage in which Miller quotes TC when writing about free will: &#x201C;[W]e see around us some men addressing themselves with stout brave hearts to what Carlyle terms with homely vigour, their &#x2018;heavy job of work,&#x2019; &#x2026; rearing up well-taught families in usefulness and comfort, to be the stay of the future&#x201D; (255&#x2013;56; TC&#x2019;s copy: Strouse).</note> coming to me thus out of the still kingdoms, has something in it of religion; and is strange and solemn in these profane, empty, times.</p>
<p>In common with everybody I mourned over the late tragic catastrophe; the world&#x2019;s great loss, especially your irreparable and ever-lamentable one: but as for <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> I confess there was always present, after the first shock, the thought that at least he was out of bondage into freedom and rest. I perceived that, for such a man there was no rest appointed except in the countries where he now is!</p>
<p>Dear Madam, what can we say? The ways of God are high and dark; and yet there is mercy hidden in them. Surely, if we knew anything, it is that &#x2018;His <hi rend="italic">goodness</hi> endureth for ever.&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 136:12.</note> I will not insult your grief by pretending to lighten it. You and your little ones, yes, you have cause, as few have had, to mourn; but you have also such assuagements as not many have.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With respectful sympathy, with many true thanks and regards, I remain, sincerely yours,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Marshall,</salute>
<p>I hear there are now some Fifty-two Candidates for that office in the London Library,&#x2014;not one of whom, as I judge from former experience in such affairs, probably possesses the least real knowledge of &#x201C;Bibliography,&#x201D; which is his essential business there. At any rate, anticipating such result, and being otherwise immeasurably busy in this my own garret, I have undertaken not to interfere at all in the &#x201C;Election,&#x201D; and shall most likely not be in the Committee at all till the unhopeful operation is quite over. This has been already my answer to five special applicants. Your friend<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Robert Harrison of Leeds, who was apptd.</note> will produce his evidences like the others; if he is in fact a &#x201C;Bibliographer&#x201D; at all, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give him a shining distinction: and otherwise, I believe the Committee are sincerely desirous to get what they think the fittest man, and will endeavor to do strict justice. I often wonder at the &#x201C;Anglo-Saxon&#x201D; methods you talk of; and the qualification that please the electors of said noble &#x201C;Anglo-Saxons&#x201D; to office.

<salute>My dearest Mary</salute>
<p>This is the fourth day I have sat down to write to you! Three several times I had hardly made a beginning, when I was interrupted by something or some body, that could not be set aside. Today is so cold and threatening; that I may hope the external world will leave me in peace; and the internal world looks auspicious enough; only that I feel to have <hi rend="italic">wool</hi> in my head instead of brains!&#x2014; The week before last we had three days of the heat of summer! and <pb id="pg-32-131" n="32:131"/>I went out&#x2014;both on foot and in a carriage. But this favourable weather lasted just long enough to enable me to ascertain by experiment how weak I was! Ever since, it has been fierce north-East wind again and I have had to keep within doors. Anne said this morning while lighting my bed-room fire, &#x201C;Upon my word, those three warm days were given us <hi rend="italic">for a complete deception</hi>&#x201D;! I could not help saying aloud &#x201C;Gracious! if my Aunt Anne<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh of Edinburgh.</note> heard you&#x201D;!&#x2014; My cough is almost gone however, and I get generally about five hours sleep&#x2014; I am wearying to know how <hi rend="italic">you</hi> go on in that particular. It is anything but a consolation to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to think of another being as ill off, or worse than myself. Thackerays daughter&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS. Anne Isabella (<date when="1837">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1919">1919</date>; <ref target="volume-32/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35761"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) and Harriet Marian (<date when="1840">1840</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875">75</date>).</note> were here yesterday, and speaking of their Grandmother&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne Carmichael-Smyth, b. Becher (<date when="1792">1792</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1864">1864</date>), Thackeray&#x2019;s mother, who lived in Paris.</note> sleeplessness&#x2014;she had just come from Paris to try what change of air would do. &#x201C;We told her about <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x201D; said the eldest Miss Thackeray, &#x201C;we thought it would be <hi rend="italic">such a comfort</hi> to her to hear of somebody in the same way as herself&#x2014;and you can&#x2019;t think how pleased she was!!&#x201D;&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Naive</hi> at least! I do think a young Human-being who has never known a day&#x2019;s sickness or sorrow, whatever <hi rend="italic">good humour</hi> may lie on the surface, is as cruel as a young Tiger! For after all one cannot bring intelligent sympathy into the world with one; as one brings one&#x2019;s hair or teeth! It has to be <hi rend="italic">learnt,</hi> painfully, by experience&#x2014; It takes fellow-feeling to &#x201C;make us wond&#x2019;rous kind.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. David Garrick (<date when="1717">1717</date>&#x2013;<date when="1779">79</date>), &#x201C;An Occasional Prologue on Quitting the Theatre,&#x201D; <date when="1776-06-10">10 June 1776</date>, given before his last performance as Felix in <hi rend="italic">The Wonder</hi> (<date when="1714">1714</date>), a comedy by Susannah Centlivre (<date when="1669">1669</date>&#x2013;<date when="1723">1723</date>); asking for the audience&#x2019;s &#x201C;smiles for sickness and for age,&#x201D; he continued: &#x201C;A fellow feeling makes one wondrous kind!&#x201D; (Arthur Murphy, <hi rend="italic">The Life of David Garrick, Esq</hi> [<date when="1801">1801</date>] 2:131).</note> I should have <hi rend="italic">loved</hi> you, dear Woman, in whatever circumstances I had had opportunity to know your good, pure heart, and winning ways; but I could not have entered into your present grief as I do, if I had never lost my own parents; and if I had slept soundly all my life, I should not have shuddered as I do, in hearing of your bad nights. And so, I felt no temptation to box poor Annie Thackeray&#x2019;s ears when she made that <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> speech, looking the while ready to burst with health and happiness! I merely thought; &#x201C;poor girl! you will understand better about all that by and by!&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne, later Lady Ritchie, wrote of her visits to Cheyne Row, as so &#x201C;vivid a part of my early life. &#x2026; [B]est of all, there was Mrs. Carlyle herself, a living picture; Gainsborough should have been alive to paint her; slim, bright, dark-eyed, upright, in her place. She looked like one of the grand ladies our father used sometimes to take us to call upon. She used to be handsomely dressed in velvet and point lace. &#x2026; She was not familiar, but cordial, dignified, and interested in everything as she sat installed in her corner of the sofa by one of the little tables covered with nicknacks of silver and mother-of-pearl. &#x2026; / She used to tell us many of the stories which have since come into print. She was never weary of discoursing of &#x2018;Carlyle.&#x2019; &#x2026; &#x2018;If you wish for a quiet life,&#x2019; she used to say, &#x2018;never you marry a dyspeptic man of genius.&#x2019; &#x2026; As children we did not have much of Carlyle&#x2019;s company &#x2026; but the sense of his presence overhead in the study distinctly added to our enjoyment so long as he remained upstairs. Mrs. Carlyle used to tell us of her early life, of her passion for study. &#x2026; Once, looking expressively at me with her dark eyes, she began to speak of self-control. &#x2018;We have all &#x2026; a great deal more power over our minds than it is at all the fashion to allow, and an infinity of resource and ability to use it. There was a time in my own life &#x2026; when I felt that unless I strove against the feeling with all my strength and might I should be crazed outright. I passed through that time safely; I was able to fight it out and not to let myself go&#x2019; &#x201D; (Anne, Lady Ritchie, <hi rend="italic">Chapters from Some Memoirs</hi> [<date when="1894">1894</date>] 134&#x2013;37).</note></p>

And a <hi rend="italic">winter</hi> at Berlin (which he seemed to contemplate) I would positively not agree to. The cold there is dreadful in winter; and I am not so suicidally disposed as to subject my delicate lungs to its action I would do a great deal that is disagreeable to meet his wishes and <hi rend="italic">keep him quiet;</hi> but I would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> carry my complisance so far as to go and <hi rend="italic">die and be buried</hi> among strangers.</p>
<p>However I escape a great deal of angry discussion by letting all his ideas take their course till the moment of carrying them into <hi rend="italic">action.</hi> So few of them ever reach that point! and they efface themselves all the sooner for not being stimulated by contradiction!</p>
<p>A Lady here, a shrewd old Maid,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> said to me once &#x201C;I never knew any wife that might get her own way so completely as you; if you only managed well!

<p>Only think! my little dog is to have his picture in the Exhibition this year! A friend of ours went into an artist&#x2019;s studio the other day, and saw a picture he was just finishing to send; &#x201C;Why, said he, that is <hi rend="italic">Nero?</hi>&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes said the Artist (the man who did your photographs) but he did not sit for it, I painted him from his photograph.&#x201D; And if he had painted only <hi rend="italic">him</hi> in the picture, I should have been well pleased; but the poor little dog has been <hi rend="italic">used</hi> up as an accessory to the figure of a&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">stark-naked Woman!</hi> just stepping into a Bath!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Tait&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Susannah,</hi> to be shown at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in <date when="1857-05">May</date>.</note> Now I dont like this at all for as my dog has a very extensive acquaintance, and the portrait of him, I am told, is recognizable at any distance, and the dog was never seen but in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> company I am in horror lest the naked figure should be taken for <hi rend="italic">me!!</hi>&#x2014; The only comfort is, the naked women in pictures are always <hi rend="italic">plump</hi>&#x2014;and I am but two degrees removed from a skeleton at present.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I had your Note this morning; I have been long looking for it. You sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> write me oftener, in these times of cheap postage; I am so held, I never write when it can be avoided. Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> also I surmise some times is an error on my part.</p>
<p>Jane has got no more <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> for a six weeks past; but is so utterly weak she cannot rally much till the sun come; and this is as grim a Mayday as I ever saw. For my own share, I am no worse than usual; often somewhat disheartened by my last mischance,&#x2014;but on the whole it is rather in the imagination, all that, if we take it up strictly. Considerable bother I have had, learning to <hi rend="italic">wear</hi> (easily) my apparatus;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For his hernia. TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1857-03-29">29 March</date>: &#x201C;First appearance of <hi rend="italic">Hernia.</hi> A great shock to me, when drying myself after bathing. May God Almighty grant that it be a useful lesson; for certainly it was a heavy and hard one. I do begin, too, to see I had <hi rend="italic">need</hi> of it. So many things loading me this winter, health gone,&#x2014;and I madly resolute to mend all by mere <hi rend="italic">force:</hi> by fiercely writing ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> nature, fiercely <hi rend="italic">riding</hi> to gain health &#x26;c. Doing the wretched bubble of &#x2018;George II &#x26; Fried<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Wilhelm&#x2019;s Quarrel&#x2019; (forsooth!) with misery wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seemed then to be <hi rend="italic">supreme</hi> enough, but was only superior! It is now Friday when I write,&#x2014;going to the Surgeon for consult<hi rend="italic">n</hi> this day.&#x2014;I find surely I have not been <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> in my procedures; surely if I be not wise, they will not prosper. Let me <hi rend="italic">be taught.</hi>&#x201D;</note> but worn, it is a complete succedaneum: I have never had either pain or inconvenience from the thing at all except in that way only. And riding answers <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than walking for it, I think. Besides it is really an admonition to me. &#x201C;Be canny!&#x201D; it says,&#x2014;for exactly in proportion to my general health is the tolerability of that &#x201C;apparatus&#x201D; and the rest of it.</p>
<p>I expect to have a Bargain made with Chapman in a few days;&#x2014;then to go fairly to press with my two volumes;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vols. 1 and 2 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> pbd. <date when="1858-09">Sept. 1858</date>.</note> get these <hi rend="italic">done</hi> within about a year;&#x2014;after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> have a long <hi rend="italic">pause</hi> (perhaps visit German<hi rend="italic">y</hi> &#x26;c) before starting on the other two. By working &#x201C;Canny, Canny,&#x201D; I believe I have still strength for this.</p>
<p>Residence in the country, with meal and milk <foreign><hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi></foreign> [freely], fresh air, and <hi rend="italic">quiet,</hi> quiet:&#x2014;this is my constant daydream at present; in fact I get a deal of annoyance out of London, and my imagination aggravates it, and <hi rend="italic">abolishes</hi> the good there is.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I expected you last night; still more confidently tonight. I find I ought to have written.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-32-139" n="32:139"/>Tonight the Printer has sent me Proofs of the <hi rend="italic">Summaries</hi> and word that he wants (meaning, <hi rend="italic">will soon want</hi>) vol i of Miscellanies. Please come to me tomorrow night if you possibly can. I will confidently expect you</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Summaries,</hi> on reading them over, I find to be extremely good; very careful, exact, and the phraseology ingenious and expressive. Hardly anything I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think of changing. But there are two points that must be attended to: <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">page-n</hi>o &#x2018;(p. 10&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> or the like) introduced here and there: <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> a more distinct method of punctuation. I think you can alter everything in the course of one day, after we have talked together: so I promise Robson you will take him back the Proofs <hi rend="italic">on Monday morning.</hi></p>
<p>By way of giving you time to understand a little what kind of <hi rend="italic">connections</hi> I mean, I enclose you the first slip with some pencillings on it: whatsoever you find dark in that we can explain in our talk at night,&#x2014;when you <hi rend="italic">take</hi> the other two slips; and <hi rend="italic">leave</hi> the vol i of <hi rend="italic">Misc</hi>s if it be ready.</p>

<p>Your benevolent permission to come out and see you at East Hampstead<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Easthampstead Park, one of the marquess of Downshire&#x2019;s seats, 3 mi. SE of Wokingham, Berkshire.</note> is not likely to be forgotten here; and accordingly there are fine projects on foot among us, which shall be executed one day. Why not now?

<p>On me, alas the hand of the Printer is heavy; the Printer, and a sad coil of other confusions, accumulated in unusual weight at present, forbid me to think of May or the flowers of East Hampstead. But my Wife, I can gather, would like very well to come for a day or two (tho&#x2019; this is a bit of a secret, in abeyance of <hi rend="italic">me</hi> for escort);&#x2014;and indeed I privately think, if Mr Plattnauer<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Plattnauer was at this time tutor to the Downshires&#x2019; children; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570522-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1857-05-22">22 May</date></ref>.</note> come out one of these days, and carried her over to you, for a brief glimpse of what she likes so well, it might be a pretty and useful thing.&#x2014; Of course consulting <hi rend="italic">her</hi> first, in a duly explicit manner;&#x2014;but he knows her address!</p>

<p><salute>Dear Sister,&#x2014;</salute>I received that Letter (by T.

It is a very good Letter, and you will have pleasure in reading it. Tom is in a field fit for a strong young fellow;&#x2014;and is very wise indeed to prefer the rugged independent plough to the contemptible implement recommended as substitute. That of boiling maple-sugar in the bush, and reading <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> by the light of the sticks, is quite great to me. I have sent Tom off his <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> (on hearing that the other has arrived): your Jim gets his, I doubt not, regularly?&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are in our usual way of health here; Jane mostly a prisoner, but free of <hi rend="italic">cold,</hi> and only waiting the <hi rend="italic">sun</hi> in order to get out again, and gather some strength. We have had the bitterest three weeks of weather I can remember for the season: but today it is Summer all over; and May, I hope, will still do itself credit.

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I have been long in answering your dear letter; If you saw Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s death in the newspapers you would partly guess why; that I was shocked, and dispirited, and feeling <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> best.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellen Twisleton spent an hour with JWC on the day of Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s funeral. She wrote to her sister, <date when="1857-05-14">14 May</date>: &#x201C;[S]he <hi rend="italic">was</hi> so unhappy, I dreaded to leave her to herself.&#x201D; On the way to Cheyne Row, she had seen Jane Brookfield: &#x201C;I shrunk back in the carriage, feeling as if it were too much to <hi rend="italic">bow</hi> to her, even,&#x2014;when she bent forward, &#x26; gave me a bow, with such a broad smile as if we had met at a dinner! &#x26; in all my life I never saw her with a more cheerful &#x26; serene expression. And two hours after, I left Mrs Carlyle&#x2014;so pale&#x2014;so wretched, hardly able to speak without crying;&#x2014;&#x26; there were the two friends (the true and the false as Edward said curtly,) &#x26; poor Lady Ashburton had not the gift to see them as they were. I couldn&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">be</hi> convinced, after that look, that Mrs B. has a heart,&#x2014;except for her own interests. I do so pity the Carlyles &#x26; Mr Venables. London will never be anything like the same to them, again&#x201D; (Houghton 45M-98).</note>
 <hi rend="italic">But</hi> you could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> guess the <hi rend="italic">outward</hi> <pb id="pg-32-147" n="32:147"/>disturbance consequent on this event! The letters and calls of inquiry and condolence that have been eating up my days for the last two weeks! distressingly and irritatingly&#x2014; For it does not require any particular accuteness to detect, in this fussy display of feeling, more impertinent curiosity than genuine sympathy. <hi rend="italic">Some</hi> Ladies (of her circle) who never were here before, have come, out of <hi rend="italic">good</hi> motives, taking to us as <hi rend="italic">her</hi> friends, out of regard for her memory&#x2014; But the greater number of these <hi rend="italic">condolers</hi> have come to ask particulars of her death (which we were likely to know) and to see how we, especially <hi rend="italic">M</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Carlyle,</hi> were taking her loss!</p>
<p>At no moment since the time she was first declared in danger could her death have come with more shock. Lord Ashburton had just been here for a week, making preparations for her immediate return to England, and he represented her as &#x201C;progressing most favourably&#x201D; Sir James Clark<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Clark (<date when="1788">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870">1870</date>; <ref target="volume-32/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5463"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), physician; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380830-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:159</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1838-08-30">30 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> who had been to Paris to see her said the same. Lord A was to have gone back to Paris on the Sunday but on Saturday he got a letter from <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> telling him to go to St Leonards<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A seaside resort 2 mi. W of Hastings, Sussex. Lord Ashburton wrote from the Grange to Lady Ashburton at 67 Avenue St. Cloud, Paris, &#x201C;Friday Evg,&#x201D; [<date when="1857-05-01">1 May</date>]: &#x201C;I have just ordered the new stove for the passage under your room; &#x26; the new dining room grate &#x26; a new grate for my room. &#x2026; I start on sunday morning early for St. Leonards, sleep at Folkstone&#x2014;start at 7.20 am for Paris, where I should arrive at 4 or 5 pm. So Sedille may put on his best materials for dinner, &#x26; we will have a jolly evening&#x201D; (NLS Acc. 11388). Sedille was the Ashburtons&#x2019; cook.</note> and take a house there: &#x201C;that she might be at the seaside, <hi rend="italic">if she liked,</hi> during <date when="1857-09">September</date>&#x201D;!&#x2014; He went and took the house, and so did not get to Paris till the Monday; when she had been <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> two hours! I never heard of so easy a death! She was dressing about four o&#x2019;clock, felt faint and called for D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Rousse (her private D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>) he told her, in answer to her question; &#x201C;what is this&#x201D;?&#x2014; &#x201C;You are going to faint, it is nothing; you mustn&#x2019;t mind these faintnesses&#x201D;! He put his arm round her to support her, she clasped her hands over his other arm, leant her forehead on his shoulder, gave a sigh, and was dead!</p>
<p>Last Tuesday M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C went to the Grange to be present at her funeral&#x2014; It was conducted with a sort of royal state, and all the men, who used to compose a sort of <hi rend="italic">Court</hi> for her, were there;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Among <sic>these</sic><corr>those</corr> present were Ulick John de Burgh (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874">74</date>), 1st marquess of Clanricarde; Granville George Leveson-Gower (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891">91</date>; <ref target="volume-32/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16543"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 2d Earl Granville (see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510928-TC-JAC-01"><sic>26:189</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1851-09-28">28 Sept. 1851</date></corr></ref>); Sir Henry George Grey (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1894">94</date>; <ref target="volume-32/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11540"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) 3d earl; John William Montagu (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884">84</date>), 7th earl of Sandwich, Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s brother; John Alexander Thynne (<date when="1831">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1896">96</date>; <ref target="volume-32/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27422"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 4th marquess of Bath; Frederick Temple Hamilton-Temple Blackwood (<date when="1826">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1902">1902</date>; <ref target="volume-32/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31914"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 1st marquess of Dufferin; William M.

 <hi rend="italic">in tears!</hi> I never heard of a gloomier funeral.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-32-148" n="32:148"/>All this has kept me from getting the good I expected from the change of weather. My cough is entirely gone; but I am weak and nervous to a degree! and driving out thro&#x2019; these stifling streets puts no strength into me. I long to be far away&#x2014; I feel as if one long breath of pure scotch air would cure me!&#x2014; The German scheme is fallen entirely into abeyance&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has commenced printing the first two volumes of his Book, and it will be a <hi rend="italic">year</hi> he says before they are ready. &#x201C;How was it then&#x201D; I asked last night, &#x201C;that you spoke of being done with them, in <hi rend="italic">two months;</hi> telling me I <hi rend="italic">must make haste and get well,</hi> to go to Germany"? Oh, said he, &#x201C;one talks all <hi rend="italic">sorts</hi> of things!&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;but, said I, that was a talk that cost me three nights sleep, and ever so many days of anxious uneasy thought"! &#x201C;Bless me!&#x201D; he said, quite astonished; &#x201C;I said all that <hi rend="italic">chiefly by way of cheering you up</hi>&#x201D;!!! Oh men! men!, how stupid you are in your dealings with us poor egg-shell wretches! There is no fear of Germany then for a year anyhow!&#x2014; And he will be too busy for going from home at all, if he can possibly stand the heat in Town. So that I fancy I shall be at liberty to regulate my own goings according to my own will; which however is hampered enough by many considerations;&#x2014;chiefly that of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> solitude and tendency to overwork himself when left in the house alone&#x2014; For his material comfort Ann can care as well as I, now; the only difference being in our scales of expenditure&#x2014;and even that is not exorbitant. It will be no kindness to him however, in the long run, to leave untried any feasible means of strengthening myself before the winter returns, to take me by the lungs; and certainly <hi rend="italic">getting out of this</hi> and breathing fresh air awhile, under favourable <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> circumstances, would be the most feasible means of all! No where could I be so well, and content, I think, as with <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> And if I could go to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for a fortnight or so, without travelling further, and making more visits; I would say at once your kind invitation is <hi rend="italic">believed in</hi> and accepted! But there are so many, in Scotland, who have always been kind to me, and whose kindness I would not for the world seem insensible to, who would be grieved and angered if I should be in Scotland without going to see them; and that sort of knocking about, as I experienced last year, is more than I have either strength or spirits for in my <hi rend="italic">normal</hi> state; After this long illness and confinement to one spot and one circle of ideas, I shudder at the bare notion of going over the ground both material and emotional that I went over last year! But it is time enough to be making up ones plans&#x2014; In the meantime I am going for a week to Easthampstead Park (the Marquis of Downshires)&#x2014;almost immediately. But these great grand Country Houses are not the places nature prompts me <pb id="pg-32-149" n="32:149"/>to take my sick nerves and bad spirits to! especially when I am not going as a sort of animated, still wholly <hi rend="italic">irresponsible carpet-bag,</hi> with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s name on it; but on my own basis! The Marchioness of Downshire is an acquaintance I have made, <hi rend="italic">myself,</hi> in a romantic sort of way&#x2014;and not one of the flattering consequences of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> celebrity. She has been very kind to me all winter, coming to see me, and sending me game and beautiful flowers; and for weeks before they left London, hardly a day had past without her daughter or boys<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alicia Maria, Arthur Wills Blundell Trumbull Sandys Roden, and Arthur William.</note> coming to ask for me. She is a most lovely, <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> woman; and so when she insisted it would do me good to go to this place of theirs I assented; hoping M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C would come too, and help me thro&#x2019; it; but he is too busy and so I find myself engaged to a piece of work that I wish to Heaven were well over! I have quite forgot how to <hi rend="italic">dress for dinner</hi> and all that sort of thing!</p>
<p>I have not made a single call <hi rend="italic">yet;</hi> but when I have finished this letter I am going off in a cab to call for the old Countess of Sandwich (Lady A&#x2019;s Mother). (She said yesterday she would like to see me) and I tremble at the prospect! Her daughter and she could never live together without misunderstandings and disagreeableness; but now the poor old woman thinks of her and talks of her as &#x201C;such a kind daughter as never lived&#x201D;! &#x201C;Would have given <hi rend="italic">her</hi> anything she had in the world&#x201D;!&#x2014; Dear! Dear! When I think of the dreadful hard things I have heard Lady Ashburton say of her Mother, at all times and always; how am I to join in, about her kindness to that Mother! in a way to please the beautiful mystification of the Mother-heart!</p>
<p>I send you some poems&#x2014;amongst which you will find <hi rend="italic">some</hi> to like&#x2014; <closer><salute>God bless you my darling! Kindest love to your Husband. I was so very thankful to hear of your improved sleep.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We are going on here pretty much in our old <hi rend="italic">feckless</hi> way; not worse in health; on the contrary, decidedly better in that respect, one of us, tho&#x2019; both still weak as need be. Jane has got rid of her express <hi rend="italic">cold,</hi> since the weather mended; goes out daily, sleeps considerably better, tho&#x2019; still indifferently; can <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> a little too, and in short is decidedly improving: but she is in such a state of feebleness and <hi rend="italic">thinness</hi> as I never saw her before; and feels tired with the slightest exertion, and overset with the slightest emotion. For above a fortnight past the weather has been excellent, sunny warmth and beauty as of <pb id="pg-32-151" n="32:151"/><hi rend="italic">real</hi> May,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; always with a kind of <hi rend="italic">easterly</hi> feeling even in the west wind. Today, after some brewing for the last two days, rain has diligently begun; mud the rule out of doors; and I suppose there will be no ride for me, at least none at the common hour. Jane, unless it prove <hi rend="italic">too</hi> wet, is to get into the country tomorrow,&#x2014;a beautiful place, called East Hampstead Park, a ten miles beyond Windsor, belonging to the Marquis-Downshire people (with whom is Plattnauer for Tutor); I have seen the Marchioness and children, never yet the M<hi rend="italic">s</hi> who seems to be a kind of original in his way, but a man of real worth and humanity;&#x2014;I said &#x201C;but"; and perhaps it ought to have been &#x201C;and"? He is nephew of L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> George Hill<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord George A. Hill (<date when="1801">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879">79</date>; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490618-TC-JAC-01"><sic>24:73</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1849-06-18">18 June 1849</date></corr></ref>), Protestant landlord in Donegal, Ireland; 5th son of the 2d marquess of Downshire and the present marquess&#x2019;s uncle.

For two years past there has been, on the part of the Lady chiefly some negociation ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a visit out thither: Jane who has now made acquaintance, and <hi rend="italic">likes</hi> the Lady not a little, is now (by diplomacy of mine) bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to do the visit, first-visit at least, <hi rend="italic">herself;</hi>&#x2014;and I calculate it will be useful to her for a few days. As many days as she can stand; not above 3 or 4, I guess.</p>
<p>As to myself I crawl along; &#x201C;working&#x201D; (if it can be called <hi rend="italic">work,</hi> which is rather obstinate puddling and attempts to work) on such terms as please me very ill. However, we are actually going to Press; &#x201C;specimen page&#x201D; sent today: and if I can hold out for another twelve month, there will be a door of deliverance opened. Steady, then! Inch by inch, even in our spent condition, we shall get the rubbish mountain dug away perhaps, and see a better outlook!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I got a great blow by that death you alluded to, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was totally unexpected to me; and the thought of it, widening ever more as I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> farther of it, is likely to be a heaviness of heart to me for a long time coming. I have indeed lost such a friend as I never had, nor am again in the least likelihood to have, in this <hi rend="italic">stranger</hi> world: a magnanimous and beautiful soul, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had furnished the English Earth and made it homelike to me in many ways, is not now here.

<p>What puts &#x201C;offending me&#x201D; into your head? You are very far from having offended me; you have only to let matters stand as they are! As the Book was delivered by a private messenger, I concluded you knew it was safe: every minute of my time is occupied; and I write no Notes (tho&#x2019; it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> often be agreeable to write such) that can possibly be avoided.</p>
<p>I will keep the Book, since you have persisted in sending it; I shall not need it for an admonition to wish you right well, tho&#x2019; it surely may serve in that capacity among others.</p>

Perfect minute and exact acquaintance with modern Prussian and German History (and Secret-History) would be one requisite; and a very superior degree of natural judgement and sound sense would be another.&#x2014; As to any interest of my own in reference to this or future Literary projects of Mr Martin, I could desire that it might not be remembered in the matter at all,&#x2014;my one wish being to have no knowledge whatever of what he does or resolves upon in that department of things.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago, not without considerable labour, I had secured for him what seemed the very fair probability of a Clerkship in the Museum: it is still my opinion that his one visible chance of a rational existence among his fellow creatures lies in that direction; and it would give me great satisfaction could he be furthered thitherward (or to a post like it) by the aid of you and friends that are so kind to him; but all other resources, tho&#x2019; valuable at the moment, I look upon as only temporary,&#x2014;nay perhaps at bottom as only a <hi rend="italic">worsening</hi> of the mischief complained of.</p>

<p>I myself mean to try East Sheen by and by: I often think my horse might carry me thither any day, especially some sunday, into a circle more <hi rend="italic">human</hi> for me than most others now are.

In the event I managed, more or less. Carlyle is a man of great courage and originality, but he is getting old and as he has aged he has become entangled in a paradox; the difficulties of liberty which he sees clearly, seem intolerable to him and he has started extolling the virtues of obedience, obedience&#x2014;would you believe! He loves Russians because, according to him, they have an excellent talent for obedience and it made him very uncomfortable when I said that the talent was not quite as complete as he had imagined.&#x2014; You have robbed me of an illusion, he cried. At the moment he is writing a history of Frederick the Great, one of his boyhood heroes because he knew how to get people to obey. &#x2026; I would like to see Carlyle in a Russian&#x2019;s shoes for just one week; he would change his tune. For the rest he is a likeable and good soul, so is his wife&#x201D; (trans.; for the original French, see Turgenev&#x2019;s correspondence, <date when="1855">1855</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858">58</date> [Moscow, <date when="1987">1987</date>] 3:225). Turgenev described the meeting to the critic Hjalmar Boyesen (<date when="1848">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895">95</date>) in <date when="1873">1873</date>; TC told him: &#x201C;This grand moving of great masses, swayed by one powerful hand&#x2014;that &#x2026; brings uniformity and purpose into history.&#x201D; Turgenev reported that TC found it &#x201C;wearisome&#x201D; that in Great Britain &#x201C;every petty individual could thrust forth his head like a frog out of its swamp, and quack away at his contemptible sentiment as long as anybody had a mind to listen to him. Such a state of things could only result in confusion and disorder. I replied that I should only ask him to go to Russia and spend a month or two in one of the interior governments, just long enough to observe with his own eyes the effect of this much-admired despotism&#x201D; (Patrick Waddington, <hi rend="italic">Turgenev in England</hi> [<date when="1980">1980</date>] 35). Turgenev was probably familiar with <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> through his friend Vassili Botkin (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869">69</date>), who had translated parts of it in the journal <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sovremennik</hi></foreign> [Contemporary] (<date when="1855">1855</date>) 10:92&#x2013;118 and (<date when="1856">1856</date>) 2:33&#x2013;54 and 92&#x2013;104. His portrayal of the Carlylean revolutionary hero in his novel <hi rend="italic">Rudin</hi> (<date when="1855">1855</date>) was possibly influenced by it; see <hi rend="italic">Rudin,</hi> trans.

<p>I got a very pleasant letter from Stuttgard a long while ago,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He wrote from Stuttgart, <date when="1856-12-13">13 Dec. 1856</date>, that he was to marry his cousin Georgiana in the summer: &#x201C;[S]ome physiologists threaten me with an idiotic nursery &#x2026; in practice, a diplomat moves so much amongst <hi rend="italic">cretins,</hi> who on enquiry do not often turn out to be the brood of cousinly marriage, that he is disposed to think that this difficulty militates against matrimony in general.&#x201D; He had just exchanged Vienna for &#x201C;this lively capital, as it is desirable that a young lady to whom &#x2026; what is called &#x2018;good&#x2019; society are somewhat new facts should not make her <hi rend="italic">debut</hi> in a dear, noisy, well dressed city. &#x2026; In three weeks I have dug out a few resources in persons &#x26; things and when these fail there is the Royal library, and as the Swabians don&#x2019;t look like a reading nation one could perhaps borrow all 300,000 vols. at once. There is moreover a Diplomatic Corps which I might reasonably spell Corp<hi rend="italic">se</hi>.&#x201D; He ends his letter with some humorous remarks on Emerson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">English Traits</hi> (Boston, <date when="1856">1856</date>) which he calls &#x201C;a very poor book.&#x201D; &#x201C;My sister [Jane Hare (d. <date when="1886">1886</date>; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430704-TC-JWC-01"><sic>16:229</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-07-04">4 July 1843</date></corr></ref>)] and myself are about <hi rend="italic">the</hi> two most uncompromising admirers of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> genius.&#x201D;</note> giving pleasant intimations of the scene round you in that old W&#xfc;rtemberg metropolis. &#x2026; One thing is very certain to me: If you are as well off as my wishes for you indicate, there will be nothing to complain of. I will hope not only that you are happy for the present time; but that you are daily gathering new culture, experience, solidity, and not only knowledge but wisdom &#x2014;daily new ability to do your work in this world well&#x2014;which by-and-by may amount to something far better than being &#x2018;happy.&#x2019;&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Oremus, speremus</hi></foreign> [Let us pray, let us hope].</p>
<p>I can send you no news of England, nor any even of myself&#x2014;life with me, for these twelve or twice twelve months past, having been but a dark and indeed almost deadly struggle in the abyss of German historical stupor&#x2014;endeavouring (with almost no success at all) to extract some human record of Frederick &#x2018;the Great,&#x2019; as he is called, out of that alarming element. Never in nature had I the notion before of such a task as this proves to me, in this place, at this time of day, in these circumstances generally! But I may get it done (<hi rend="italic">ill</hi> since <hi rend="italic">well</hi> is impossible); <hi rend="italic">done</hi> on any terms if so much life be allowed me. And, indeed, that is pretty much the one hope I have left&#x2014;that of getting <hi rend="italic">rid</hi> of this intolerable torment&#x2014;that has made my life <hi rend="italic">black</hi> (as it were&#x2014;yes, and even <hi rend="italic">base,</hi> as it were) for five or six years past! The cause of my writing at present is that same business: to get a little light from you perhaps, about a point of W&#xfc;rtemberg history which will come to concern me by-and-by. &#x2026;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-32-159" n="32:159"/>I know the <hi rend="italic">Pfaffs,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Spittlers,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl Pfaff (<date when="1795">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866">1866</date>), historian, who wrote several histories of W&#xfc;rtemberg. Ludwig Timotheus von Spittler (<date when="1752">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1810">1810</date>), prof. of history at G&#xF6;ttingen, who also wrote on W&#xfc;rtemberg. TC is possibly referring to Pfaff&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des F&#xfc;rstenhauses und Landes Wirtemberg,</hi> 2 vols.

<p><salute>Now my dearest Mary will you mind this?</salute> When you have a headach, you are never to make a matter of conscience of writing to me! One does that sort of thing to people one is on ceremony with&#x2014;people who only believe in one according to one&#x2019;s outward acts and words from moment to moment&#x2014;but surely you and I are got beyond <hi rend="italic">that</hi> surface-state of things&#x2014;and you might keep me waiting for a letter, till your poor head was out of pain; without risk or fear of my thinking you fickle or negligent. I know that a feverish activity is often an accompaniment or premonitory symptom of headach, and that just <hi rend="italic">because</hi> one is ill, and needing perfect rest, one gets into a fuss of mind &#x201C;about many things&#x201D; and over exerts oneself needlessly&#x2014;but you, my Dear, a D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> wife, should have learnt to be on your guard against that false activity and to repress it. If you had not told me you had a headach I should have known it <pb id="pg-32-160" n="32:160"/>all the same, from the <hi rend="italic">anxious</hi> tone of your letter. How many such letters have I myself written under the same physical pressure! Oh don&#x2019;t I know that tone to my cost!</p>
<p>I felt very sorry for you with the worry of new servants a-head; and you so sad and weary! but I dont know but that, like a nauseous medecine, it will be good for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in the long run. I have often found, in <hi rend="italic">looking back</hi> that a thing which I had looked forward to with dread, and found detestable when I was <hi rend="italic">in it,</hi> had been the very best thing that could have happened for me&#x2014;the very thing I needed, to rouse me, or to calm me down, to cure me of some morbidness or other, and bring me back to a healthy practical being. Good Heavens how tormented I used to be at Craigenputtoch with the incapicity of my servants! and how hard I felt it that I should have to bake bread, and make cheeses, and all that sort of thing; &#x201C;I who hadn&#x2019;t been brought up to it&#x201C;&#x2014; my Dear! but that for that very bother with the Practical I should have&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">gone mad</hi> at Craigenputtoch! as sure I am now sane! No woman brought up as I had been&#x2014;with the vehement nature and romantic ideas I then had&#x2014;could have lived four years at that place and kept her senses; without a good heavy load of <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> difficulties and annoyances to keep her down to the firm earth!</p>
<p>I shall be very relieved however to hear that the new servants bid fair to suit. At all events you will be delivered from the sore feeling you must have had to the old ones, who had failed you in your time of need. It is miserable to live under the same roof, and in the constant presence of anyone whose hardness and coldness is like a wall of ice, that all one&#x2019;s sympathies break themselves against!</p>
<p>My Anne, I am thankful to say, gets more <hi rend="italic">human</hi> every year. The manner she had acquired in her London services, gradually thaws under my persevering efforts to get at her heart. Perhaps someday she will get really &#x201C;attached&#x201D; to me! at present, after four years and a half&#x2019;s trial; she <hi rend="italic">rather approves of me</hi> as a woman and a mistress! and has no thought of leaving me! Which I am glad of for she is a capital Servant&#x2014;and gives entire satisfaction to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, who is in fact not easy to satisfy! of course I should like her better if she had warmer feelings&#x2014;still; the faults one knows and has used one&#x2019;self to are far preferable to those one has to learn.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was greatly benefitted by my visit at Easthampstead Park<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine Jewsbury met JWC by chance on the train on her way back to London: &#x201C;I had left her nearly dead and quite unable to walk and there she stood at the window looking quite brilliant. &#x2026; [She] was now returning with a big bouquet of flowers half as large as herself&#x2014;and the two days in the country had worked the miracle of bringing her back to life and apparent health&#x201D; (see Norma Clarke, <hi rend="italic">Ambitious Heights</hi> [<date when="1990">1990</date>] 209; MS: Mantell Papers).</note>&#x2014; The people <pb id="pg-32-161" n="32:161"/>were adorably kind, and the place like&#x2014;Scotland! Large tracts of heather and whins and plantations of Scotch fir. The house is a very grand old &#x201C;rambling&#x201D; house, which was given by James 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> to the Ancestor of the present Marquis.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles I (<date when="1600">1600</date>&#x2013;<date when="1649">1649</date>) gave Easthampstead Park to William Trumbull (<date when="1565">1565</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1635">1635</date>), diplomat, for a rent of &#xa3;2 a year, on condition that he maintain a deer park for the king&#x2019;s recreation. On Charles&#x2019;s orders, a large mansion was built incorporating the royal hunting lodge that had been built about <date when="1335">1335</date> for Edward III (<date when="1312">1312</date>&#x2013;<date when="1377">77</date>).

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your kind and affectionate Note was a real pleasure to me yesterday morning: a friendly voice does a great deal of good to me in my present dilapidated state. I do not answer at all above a fifth-part of the wretched messages (mainly from fools, &#x26; with whom I have no concern) which the invaluable Penny Stamp brings me;&#x2014;I in fact write no Notes but on compulsion; or at a rare time, as now, when there is invitation to it, and an accident of leisure. If you wrote oftener to me in these circumstances, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the greater favour,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; beyond my deserts on the arithmetical account.</p>
<p>Probably I am rather <hi rend="italic">better</hi> in health; the industrious riding, on this excellent horse, sometimes seems to myself to be slowly telling on me; but I am habitually in sombre mournful mood; conscious of great weakness,&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">defeated</hi> kind of creature, with a right good load of sorrow hanging on me, and no goal that looks very glorious to aim towards now within sight. All my days and hours go to that sad task of mine; at it I keep weakly grubbing and puddling, weakly but steadily,&#x2014;try to make daily some little <hi rend="italic">way,</hi> as now almost the one thing useful. I refuse all invitations whatsoever, for several reasons; and may be defined as a mute solitary being at present,&#x2014;comparable to an Owl on the Housetop<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC conflates &#x201C;owl of the desert&#x201D; and &#x201C;sparrow alone upon the house top&#x201D;; cf. Ps. 102:6&#x2013;7.</note> in several respects. The truth is I had enough before; and find since, I have had, privately, a great loss and sorrow lately, as it were, of the one genuine Friend I had acquired in these parts, whose nobleness was more precious to me than I knew;&#x2014;a loss not in any measure to be repaired in the world henceforth. That of old Johnson (common to old men in this world) often comes into my head&#x2014;&#x2018;Been delayed till most of those whom I wished to please are sunk into the grave, and success and failure are empty sounds. I therefore dismiss it with frigid indifference&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Samuel Johnson, end of preface, <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of the English Language</hi> (<date when="1755">1755</date>).</note>&#x2014; But will do it the best I can, all the same.

Such a work for <foreign><hi rend="italic">fikings</hi></foreign> and adjustments as you could not imagine! About perhaps 3 sheets are in type, and at last even are corrected; but nothing has yet come to me in the final form; indeed Chap 1 (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> lags a good deal <hi rend="italic">behind</hi> the rest) is only ready this day to go out of my hands, as &#x201C;corrected <hi rend="italic">slips.</hi>&#x201D; Heigho! But I must push along,&#x2014;not <hi rend="italic">too</hi> hard either,&#x2014;and work incessantly towards deliverance: every line that is <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> is like a pennyweight fairly off one&#x2019;s back; and the day is looked for when it will all be off!&#x2014; I go out nowhither, speak to almost nobody; dine now about <hi rend="italic">4</hi> p.m, and go riding at 5 (&#x201C;quarter to 5&#x201D;) with the regularity of a machine. I must have already ridden between 2 and 3,000 miles since first starting on this occasion! My general feeling is that my health rather <hi rend="italic">mends:</hi> I have not that permanent <hi rend="italic">nausea</hi> that has long dwelt in my inner man,&#x2014;or at least have it in a diminished degree;&#x2014;the liver, I judge, must be slowly coming round.</p>
<p>Jane continues to stir about according to faculty; but is really very weak. Encouraged by me in the enterprise, she is at last about setting off for Scotland;&#x2014;goes next week, some day, for Sunny Bank, where the good old Donaldsons are very urgent; she may be alone there for perhaps a 3 weeks; after that in various other places, till the hot weather pass, or she have a notion to return. I am like to be extremely solitary, &#x201C;owl in desart"<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 102:6.</note> not more so; but I hoped the poor soul might get much benefit, and so urged her.</p>

<p><salute>Oh Mary Mary!</salute> Aren&#x2019;t you well ashamed of yourself?&#x2014; For me; remembering that I told you not to <hi rend="italic">force</hi> yourself to write in unfavourable circumstances; it does not surprise me&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">much</hi>&#x2014;that you leave me without letters altogether! So often I have had occasion to remark&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">There!</hi> that is what one gets for showing consideration"!&#x2014; Indeed I see that it is the exacting, impatient people that are always first attended to in this world, and that putting on a modest amiable face and stepping into the waiting room with ones claims only gets one overlooked&#x2014; Well my Dear I have been upsides with you&#x2014;for if you have not written to me I have not written to you; tho&#x2019; I have had matters on hand in which you might have felt some interest&#x2014; For the last few weeks I have thought of nothing but whether I should go to Scotland,&#x2014;or go to some nearer less loved place,&#x2014;or stay here at <place>Chelsea</place> and&#x2014;die!&#x2014; I have indeed been very <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> and weak and miserable since the last heat came altho it is now cool and wet.&#x2014; For my life I could not come to a decision&#x2014;at <pb id="pg-32-171" n="32:171"/>least, I decided twenty times a day, and as often revised and reversed these spasmodic decisions. And the <hi rend="italic">consciousness</hi> of my diseased volition made me fear I was going out of my wits&#x2014;it was so new and strange a thing for me not to know <hi rend="italic">what I would be at!</hi> At last one day last week I said to myself if I would keep out of Bedlam this must end! If I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> form a resolution with any stability in it; at least I may seize one of my <hi rend="italic">moments of resolution</hi> to do something that will lay me under a moral or physical necessity to follow one or other course of action, and so give myself <hi rend="italic">a fictitious volition</hi> at least. And so, having received a letter from my dear old friends at Haddington,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Jessie Donaldson&#x2019;s letter of &#x201C;Friday even<hi rend="italic">g</hi>&#x201D; [<date when="1857-07-03">3 July</date>?]: &#x201C;My beloved friend. How could we live without your letters, but the hope of nearer closer intercourse held out by the dear letter of today has been cheering and refreshing in a degree which I cannot describe cannot on paper portray&#x201D;; she thought there would be no &#x201C;dereliction of duty in being absent from Mr Carlyle for a little when your own dear health may derive such benefit &#x26; it would be doing such an act of charity.&#x201D; JWC had apparently called on Lord Ashburton, as Jessie commented &#x201C;it must have been a most painful visit&#x201D; to him.</note> that gave me for the moment a longing to see them once more&#x2014;and to gratify <hi rend="italic">their</hi> longing for <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> I sat down, and without taking counsel with man or woman dog or canaries or own flesh and blood; wrote to them that I would be at Sunny Bank on Tuesday or Wednesday next!! and hurried off the letter to the post office before I had had five minutes to change my mind in! Quite right for the next hour I would have given the world to recall it, and recommence shilly shallying! But to inflict a pang of disappointment on these old old women, who have so few pleasures now and who love me so dearly, was in the nature of a moral impossibility&#x2014;as I had forseen it&#x2014;and so&#x2014;there only remained for me to make my preparations and keep my word.</p>
<p>The thought of the long journey is terrifying enough. And so is the thought of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C left here to his own devices&#x2014; But I try to not think. I have settled to travel by night&#x2014;it will be a deliverance from heat and dust&#x2014;and the loss of a nights sleep is of less moment to me than most people&#x2014;as I sleep so badly in my own comfortable bed&#x2014;</p>
<p>What further will become of me&#x2014;I cannot predict&#x2014; My plan will <supplied>[be]</supplied> arranged from hand to mouth after I get to Sunny Bank&#x2014;depending on how I feel my strength hold out and how M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C gets along without me&#x2014; But if I go back to London by the road I came, to spare myself fatigue and excitement, I will go to see you next summer&#x2014;if we be all alive then&#x2014;</p>
<p>I want very much to hear of your health&#x2014;especially of your sleep&#x2014;and I want to hear how the new servants turn out&#x2014; I do pray Heaven, <hi rend="italic">well</hi>&#x2014;for you are not strong enough just now to be worried with doing the work of thoseyou pay to do it. and with inco[m]petency and bad dispositions&#x2014; My address for a week after you receive this will be care of Miss Donaldson / Sunny Bank / Haddington&#x2014; My love to the Doctor&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-32-172" n="32:172"/>What does he think of Miss Madeline Smith<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Madeleine Hamilton Smith (<date when="1835">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1928">1928</date>) of Glasgow was being tried for murdering Emile L&#x2019;Angelier (<date when="1823">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857">57</date>), who died of arsenic poisoning, <date when="1857-01-23">23 March</date>; the trial began <date when="1857-06-30">30 June</date>, and the case against Smith was found &#x201C;not proven&#x201D; (Scots law&#x2019;s additional verdict to &#x201C;guilty&#x201D; or &#x201C;not guilty&#x201D;), <date when="1857-07-09">9 July</date>.</note> I feel quite ashamed&#x2014;of her being a Scotch woman.</p>

<p><salute>Oh mercy! Lord be thanked!</salute> &#x201C;Good times, and bad times, and all times pass over&#x201C;&#x2014; Last night is passed over&#x2014;like an excessively bad dream! And I am sitting here in cleanness and quiet, announcing my safety; so far. But it is a wonder that somebody else has not rather to announce my death&#x2014;by &#x201C;bad air&#x201D;!&#x2014; Oh my Dear! you saw all those people in one box&#x2014;sixteen of them!&#x2014;well! imagine that they closed <hi rend="italic">every</hi> window and slit except the fourth window commanded by Georgina<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Craik.</note> and me! Not one breath of air to be had all night except in holding one&#x2019;s head out of the window! Craik and his insipid offsprings were very attentive and kind, and I eat my cold fowl wing and drank a little brandy and water, and the large Scotchman who <hi rend="italic">blew</hi> up my air-cushion, offered me &#x201C;his shoulder to rest on, if it would be of any service&#x201C;&#x2014;but what availed all that against &#x201C;a polluted atmosphere&#x201D;?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;My Jane&#x2019;s miserable illness now over, a visit to Haddington was steadily in view all summer. July 7.&#x2014; Craik from Belfast, with his daughters, was here holidaying; had decided on flying to Edinburgh by some unrivalled and cheap excursion train, and persuaded her to go with them. I accompanied to Euston Square; had dismal omens of the &#x2018;unrivalled,&#x2019; which were fully realised through the night&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s headnote, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:310&#x2013;11). JWC took the Great Northern Edinburgh train from King&#x2019;s Cross, not Euston, station.</note> how it happened that every body got thro the night alive I cant explain&#x2014;nay every body but Craik, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of his girls and myself sleeped the sleep of the just!&#x2014; By the way you may tell M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">snoring</hi>&#x201D; is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> audible in a railway train. <pb id="pg-32-174" n="32:174"/>My chief torment proceeded from the tendency to sleep, produced by the atmosphere, getting itself overcome by the upright position with no rest for the head. It &#x201C;was cheap&#x201D; but I did not &#x201C;like it&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280819-JWC-TC-01"><sic>4:393</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1828-08-19">19 Aug. 1828</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:199</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10-21">21 Oct. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; And have seldomer been thankfuler than when I found myself the only living creature visible at the Dunbar Station<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >10 mi. E of Haddington, where JWC changed trains.</note> after the Craiks had streamed away. I washed my face with eau de Cologne and combed my disheveled hair in a little cold tidy waiting room&#x2014; And in about an hour my train came and picked me up and set me down at Haddington Station soon after nine&#x2014;where <hi rend="italic">the carriage</hi> was duly waiting&#x2014; I never saw the country about here look so lovely but I viewed it all with a calm about as morbid as was my excitement last year!&#x2014; Dear Miss Jess received me with open arms in a room with a bright fire and the prettiest breakfast table set out&#x2014; Miss Donaldson does not come down till eleven&#x2014; They are the same heavenly kind creatures&#x2014;and there is no falling off even in looks since last year&#x2014; I am not going out of the house again today&#x2014;but I cannot write I am so wearied&#x2014;oh so dreadfully wearied!&#x2014; Being hindered from sleeping is quite another thing from not being able to sleep&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Thank God, my poor little Dear, here is at last a Letter!</salute> Came about 2 p.m.; in the morning I was quite in a quandary, could not tell what to make of it; and Geraldine, who was duly over, got plenty of my chagrins to convey to you. Oh what a passage, my poor little Goody, Goody: Oh dear, oh dear! I was quite miserable all the way home, to leave you in such a hole,&#x2014;the rather as I noticed, just when you were rolling off, one of the first-class carriages behind you with not a soul in it. You shall go no more into any wretched saving of that kind; never more, while we have money at all, remember that! I consoled myself thinking most of your neighbours would go out in the Fen Countries,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parts of Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, and Lincolnshire around the Wash on the E coast of England.

<p>We are doing well enough here. I came long roundabouts, that night, Tottenham Court Road<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Traveling SSE then SW to Chelsea.</note> &#x26;c, of a dusty sad aspect, like districts of Manchester; suitable enough to the mood I was myself in, with my poor weak Jeannie so bested.

<p>It will never do to undertake the Printing of <hi rend="italic">Fr</hi>h on <hi rend="italic">weaker</hi> terms than the usual! Far the contrary, I assure you, is only fair-play. Probably you never had, certainly I never, an occasion in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the difference between a <hi rend="italic">Master</hi> in the Art of Printing and a <hi rend="italic">Non-Master</hi> was like to be so momentous to the poor Book and Author!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If <hi rend="italic">you</hi> absolutely cannot take the <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> in hand, but another must do it, I <pb id="pg-32-178" n="32:178"/>shall reckon it a great misfortune to me. Not to be undergone, except there be absolutely no help. But as to the &#x2018;deficiency of type,&#x2019; that is clearly a remediable evil;&#x2014;and I will beg that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> at least be instantly remedied! Good type is about worth its price, however much of it you have. It will really and truly be a great evil to me if I cannot see the whole one of these Book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> (169 pages, it appears) truly <hi rend="italic">in type at the same time.</hi> I cannot by any method get them <hi rend="italic">recopied,</hi> with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> blunders that will make them worse; and I have no way of fairly <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> the Piece (to cut it into portions, title it, <hi rend="italic">constrain</hi> it into some lucidity, the best attainable) except <hi rend="italic">in slips all together.</hi> Now attend to this;&#x2014;and if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> (for my present reader, tho&#x2019; a sensible man, is evidently fitter for another kind of Book), I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> still hope for a successful issue.

<dateline><place>Sunny Bank</place> Sunday [<date when="1857-07-12">12 July 1857</date>]</dateline>
<p>I had fairly torn myself out of the arms of Miss Jess yesterday, and was running up stairs &#x201C;to write to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x201C;: when she called after me; &#x201C;but, my Dear, he wont get your letter tomorrow, It&#x2019;s Sunday&#x201D;! So I had just to come back &#x201C;with my finger in my mouth.&#x201D; That night on the road had set my mental clock all wrong. Otherwise, it has had no bad consequence; and I am certainly better already for my &#x201C;change of air&#x201D;; am stronger, hungrier and sleepier! And it is not the sudden, miraculous betterness of last year, beginning and ending in the excitement of the thing! This time there has been no excitement &#x201C;to speak of&#x201C;&#x2014;repetition and the sobering effects of long illness have quite taken off the edge of my &#x201C;feelings&#x201D; and I can look round me in the Church-yard itself&#x2014;with the dead calm of a Ghost.</p>
<p>I have not been in any house of the Town yet, except &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Miss Welsh&#x2019;s</hi>&#x201D; who, I was told by Miss Donaldson, was dangerously ill&#x2014;proving the authenticity of her relationship, by appearances of consumption.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John (&#x201C;Jackie&#x201D;) Amelia Welsh (<date when="1809">1809</date>?&#x2013;64), illegitimate da. of JWC&#x2019;s paternal uncle William (<date when="1790">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1819">1819</date>; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420325-TC-JWC-01"><sic>14:90</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-03-25">25 March 1842</date></corr></ref>) and Elizabeth Scott.</note> I have visited <hi rend="italic">her</hi> twice&#x2014;in her bed&#x2014;and it seems to me, if she be dying, it is not of her disease but of <pb id="pg-32-179" n="32:179"/>the remedies. The poor thing got quite cheerful and <hi rend="italic">laughed</hi> several times while I staid with her; tho&#x2019; &#x201C;she hadnt spoken a word all day.&#x201D; She is &#x201C;greatly respected in the Town by rich and poor.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Howdens<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Thomas and Jessie Howden.</note> and others have called for me; but during my drive&#x2014;I go every day after breakfast first a short drive with the Miss Donaldsons and then a long one by myself&#x2014; I drive generally seaward&#x2014;and yesterday I went to Aberleddy and investigated its capacities as a seabathing place&#x2014;in case you should be on the look out for one again. I have no hesitation in saying that it would suit you&#x2014;suit <hi rend="italic">us</hi>&#x2014;better than any other seaside place I ever saw. You know what a sea! clear and azure as the skies! <hi rend="italic">That</hi> on one hand; and on the other a green fertile lovely country&#x2014; Then the village itself is very clean and perfectly &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">silent</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; In spite of the influx of English to Scotch Bathing Places; <hi rend="italic">here</hi> they have not&#x2014;and cannot come! There are only <hi rend="italic">three</hi> sets of <hi rend="italic">Lodgings</hi> that I could hear of in the whole place&#x2014;and no more are likely to be established&#x2014;as the village belongs to Lord Weems,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Wemyss (<date when="1796">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1883">1883</date>), 7th earl.</note> who wont have it thrown open to the public. I looked at these lodgings&#x2014;one was too small for anything. There was one <hi rend="italic">flat</hi> in a Bakers&#x2014;roomy enough but untidy&#x2014; Another consisting of two small sitting rooms&#x2014;and two bedrooms and a kitchen and <hi rend="italic">attics</hi>&#x2014;tho small not <hi rend="italic">stuffy</hi> like those Eastbourne houses<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >E Sussex coast resort, 57 mi.

<p><salute>My dear you are already getting terribly deficient in writing;</salute> I made sure of a Letter at least today: but 3 o&#x2019;clock is here, Piper<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The postman.</note> past with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> calling: how is this? To think of <hi rend="italic">valid</hi> excuses that there might be, is too frightful! And yet I continually remember that horrid bath you had in the railway night. I beg of you to write <hi rend="italic">immediately,</hi> and tell me the truth about yourself. At other times I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not make the writing of Notes to me a burden to you; but you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> not leave me in any suspense as the above. You know, I doubt not, how pleasant all Letters of yours are to me, and what a treat one daily or oftener w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be; but it shall remain in the hands of your own charity, except as regards health-bulletins: with these I cannot dispense!</p>

<p><pb id="pg-32-182" n="32:182"/>This is your birthday; dear little soul, may God grant us only many of them,&#x2014;I think now and then I could dispense with all other blessings! Our years have been well laden with sorrows, a quite sufficient <hi rend="italic">ballast</hi> allowed us; but while we are together here, there is always a world left. I am not to send you any Gift, other than this scrap of Paper; but I might give you California, and not mean more than perhaps I do. And so may there be many years; and (as poor Irving used to say) the worst of them over!&#x2014;</p>
<p>All is going on here in a tolerable sort. Dog Nero is wriggling himself upon the dry grass beside me; canaries are bursting now and then into song; I watered the two vegetable individualities, and (except that a yellow scoundrel is grinding his organ audibly) things are all well. I have not indeed slept well, these three nights; but perhaps it was partly want of walking enough. I am dieted reasonably: brown-soups and pudding today, for example;&#x2014;Anne even undertakes to make me porridge; she <hi rend="italic">did</hi> it too, on Saturday night, really not so very ill. I had decided on renouncing my milk otherwise:&#x2014;two nights I took the cream off it, hid it below one of the &#x201C;noblemen&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Two china seats (little china barrel-shaped things) in the garden here, which were always called &#x2018;Noble-men,&#x2019; from a spiteful remark of Anne&#x2019;s about the purchase of them&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:332); see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570611-TC-JAC-01"><sic>163</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1857-06-11">11 June 1857</date></corr></ref>; see also <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570709-TC-JWC-01"><sic>176</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1857-07-09">9 July 1857</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570713-TC-JWC-01"><sic>181</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1857-07-13">13 July 1857</date></corr></ref> where TC is sitting on one.</note> in the Garden, and it was as sweet as nuts in the morning! But porridge (after a long walk) will be a real improvement. Our weather has grown hot, hot: I have fled the garret, and got under the awning altogether,&#x2014;today and yesterday for the whole day. Waste-basket for papers, and Butler&#x2019;s tray<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A rectangular hardwood tray, with hinged sides, which can be folded out to make a flat oval.</note> for Books, are in requisition: you never saw a nicer awning than I have now made it, by readjusting the ropes;&#x2014;and I even get some shadow of work done in it, on these more wholesome terms. Nay today I had my breakfast there,&#x2014;wished you had been with me on such a pastoral occasion.</p>

Long-standing religious and political grievances against the British administration in India, exacerbated by rumors that cartridges were being greased with cow and pig fat (offensive to Hindus and Muslims), culminated in a brutal and widespread uprising, which began, <date when="1857-05-10">10 May</date>, at Meerut, 30 mi. NE of Delhi. News of the rebellion, known as the Indian Mutiny, did not reach London until the end of June, first reported, <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1857-06-27">27 June</date>. The <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1857-07-13">13 July</date>, on the basis of intelligence from <date when="1857-06-08">8 June</date>, reported that it was clearly no local disturbance &#x201C;arising from any definite grievance real or imagined, with which we have to deal. It is the rising of a whole army against a Supreme Power.&#x201D; It was hopeful that the next news would be of the &#x201C;insurgents&#x2019; defeat&#x201D;; the rebellion continued until <date when="1859-07">July 1859</date>.</note> Anson, the late Sham Commander, is dead of <pb id="pg-32-183" n="32:183"/>cholera.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen.

<p><salute>Good morning Dear!</salute> I wonder if you are &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">quite</hi> happy and comfortable&#x201D; this morning? or&#x2014;what shall I say?&#x2014;&#x201C;Con<hi rend="small-caps">trair</hi>y&#x201D;?

<p>This is the state of the facts: 1<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript">o</hi></hi>.

I am up to the chin in sybiline paper-clippings; and have quitted all regular military studies for the present; being too busy with other portions of this my unblessed Problem. 3<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript">o</hi></hi>. I decidedly like Sir De Lacy, and remember with pleasure a meeting there once already was at Macready&#x2019;s long ago.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had met the Evanses at a dinner at Macready&#x2019;s, <date when="1846-12-18">18 Dec. 1846</date>; see <hi rend="italic">The Diaries of William Charles Macready, <date when="1833">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851">1851</date>,</hi> William Toynbee, ed.

<p>If out of these four facts you can draw any conclusion but a sad negative one, you will surprise!</p>
<p>I write <foreign><hi rend="italic">sub dio</hi></foreign> [in the open air] (literally), on the green of the little Garden; and all the light is gone from this balmy summer sky,&#x2014;and the world is left to darkness and to me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Gray, &#x201C;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.&#x201D;</note></p>

<p>Our weather here is rising towards the intolerable in point of heat. Hotter today than ever, and next to no breath of wind going. I have quite left the House; breakfasted under my awning again, wrote till after 1 p.m. there,&#x2014;</p>

How <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;overset&#x201C;</hi> I was all yesterday, by the fierce pain I had suffered and the want of sleep, and, worst of all, (I think) the chloroform I had <hi rend="italic">swallowed,</hi> I cannot describe.&#x2014;I was not even <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> my usual drive! Last night I was quite free from pain, and slept, by snatches; but I am very weak in body and mind&#x2014;would rather like to be in my own bed at Chelsea!&#x2014; Not that I lack any comfort here I could have there&#x2014;and certainly I am more <hi rend="small-caps">made of</hi> here than I should be anywhere else in the world! but that very <hi rend="small-caps">making of</hi> worries, when one has got disused to it.</p>
<p>But really, if I have nothing to tell you but this sort of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Peesweep</hi></foreign>-thing, it were as well to let alone writing&#x2014; And you cannot get a letter tomorrow in any case&#x2014; Only&#x2014;I thought if I posted one today, you would get it the first thing on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Eliza<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Donaldson.</note> does not arrive till next Wednesday which is certainly very good of her.

So it still rests in the vague, the day of my departure.</p>
<p>While I was feeling to be gaining strength&#x2014;I was easy in my mind about leaving you alone&#x2014; It was more important for you to avoid a repetition of my last winter&#x2019;s illness or worse&#x2014;than to be a little solitary and even a little put about by my absence at present&#x2014;but these two last days I am always thinking, &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">if</hi> I have taken this long expensive journey&#x2014;and left things at home to Providence, for no permanent benefit to my health, which would reflect itself on &#x201C;others&#x201D;!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">if!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; And then I assure you I am tempted to &#x201C;drop a tear over myself&#x201D; like <foreign>Peesweep</foreign>&#x2014;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201D; &#x2018;<foreign>Pees<hi rend="italic">weep</hi></foreign>&#x2019; (<foreign>Pee<hi rend="italic">wit</hi></foreign> = Lapwing), appropriate nickname of my imbecile Clerk (now <date when="1866">1866</date> a flourish<hi rend="italic">g</hi> literary character!)&#x2014;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note on MS).

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>It is long that I have been in your debt for a word of writing; not forgetting you, tho&#x2019; silent: but indeed, except that there is no important change here, as I suppose you hear otherwise, next to nothing new was to be said;&#x2014;and so the credit account stands as we see. Having a vacant quarter of an hour today (<hi rend="italic">end</hi> of a kind of job, or <hi rend="italic">half</hi> end, and head too <hi rend="italic">achy</hi> and sick for starting another), I send a line, before going out to try if a walk will do anything for me.</p>
<p>Jane went away to Haddington, exactly a fortnight ago; still very weak, poor soul, and much in need of country to help in gathering a little strength against winter. Up to yesterday her news were very flourishing; great <hi rend="italic">motherhood</hi> of welcome from the good old Ladies; sad but blessed quiet, and <hi rend="italic">medicine</hi> for the soul itself in those old scenes of the Past and the Departed. But on Saturday last, she had again got some whiff of cold, and seems to have been very miserable: I wait anxiously today for farther accounts. It is already the Post-hour, and nothing has come; but one cannot yet say there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> nothing; so <hi rend="italic">irregular</hi> has the rapid Rowland Hill become,&#x2014;sorrow on him the never-resting Quack; apparently he does not know that of all faults in a Post-office, <hi rend="italic">uncertainty</hi> is the very worst, not to be made good by never so much speed!&#x2014; I had a Note, of extreme brevity, from John today, which reports you all as in the usual way: with your <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> too, about Pipes, I have lately had some correspondence since his return.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570529-TC-JA-01">TC to JA, <date when="1857-05-29">29 May</date></ref>.</note></p>

<p><salute>Oh my gracious! these posts are too bad!</salute> I posted a letter for you on Saturday morning, and there at 5 on Monday you have not got it! and <hi rend="italic">your</hi> letter dated Friday reached me only yesterday (Monday) afternoon! That however was the fault of the double address, for it came with a large &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Missent to Chelsea</hi>&#x201D; on it.</p>
<p>I thought there would be <hi rend="italic">some</hi> sign of life from you today&#x2014;so put off writing till after my drive and the midday post-time. And now dinner is ordered earlier I find that I may go to see &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the flower show</hi>&#x201D; in the Corn Market&#x2014;So I shall need to be brief&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have had no more toothache&#x2014;but two bad nights from other causes. the one produced by the <hi rend="italic">cow</hi> of the Establishment, who fell into &#x201C;a state of mind&#x201D; and lowed incessantly, close to the house&#x2014; the other was due to &#x201C;derangement in my Interior&#x201D; (as you would say). on the whole, I have been rather getting the conceit taken out of me, the last few days. Especially, the <hi rend="italic">stillness</hi> <pb id="pg-32-194" n="32:194"/>I was figuring myself on seems to have been after all the imaginary stillness of a top in full <hi rend="italic">spin!</hi>&#x2014;(to use an excellent figure of your own) For I find my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">finer sensibilities</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-carlyle-notebook"><sic>30:167</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Notebook, <date when="1845-04-13">13 April 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> as sharp at present as Paget-razors!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps from Richard Paget, 195 Piccadilly, surgeons&#x2019; instrument maker and cutler.</note> I went to see &#x201C;old M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Goderich&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> last night whom I had not seen since I left Haddington&#x2014;when she was a handsome woman&#x2014;and I couldnt help crying myself sick and sore&#x2014; To be sure she looked more like a disembodied spirit than anything else, and cried herself, in speaking of my Father.

<p>Are you sure you do not <hi rend="italic">poison</hi> yourself with these chloroforms and things? I wish you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take care!&#x2014; But indeed you are convinced as much as myself of the hopelessness of drugging: yet when pain is intolerable one flies to any resource.

<p>My poor Dear, you must not fret yourself ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> not getting well all at once; that is clearly not possible on any terms. Above all things, do not grudge about the trouble you have taken, the expense, me &#x26;c &#x26;c.

If your trouble bring the least increase of health, can trouble be <hi rend="italic">better</hi> bestowed? As for me, I hope to be found extant here, and even with a bit of work done,&#x2014;and if you come back to me a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> better, will not that make me forget everything?&#x2014; The truth is, I do &#x201C;pretty well, considering.&#x201D; All I complain of is &#x201C;gloom&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c; and I do not know how I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get well rid of that at present, even if I <hi rend="italic">had you,</hi> to throw some portion of it upon!

<p>But about Miss Smith&#x2014;I have one thing to tell you, which I think you will be rather glad of, as giving the death-stroke to Testimonials!

Haddington has half the honour of having produced this cockatrix!&#x2014; I knew her great grandmother&#x2014;a decent ancient woman, called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Mealy</hi> Janet&#x201D; never to be seen but with a bag of flour under each arm&#x2014; She was Mother to the &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Hamilton&#x2014;architect of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Smith&#x2019;s paternal grandfather was the prominent Glasgow architect David Hamilton (<date when="1768">1768</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843">1843</date>); JWC apparently confused him with an Edinburgh architect&#x2014;possibly either the distinguished architect Thomas Hamilton (<date when="1784">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858">1858</date>; <ref target="volume-32/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12131"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) of 9 Howe St., although Hamilton was b. in Edinburgh and had no Haddington connection that can be traced&#x2014;or his uncle, John Hamilton, also an architect; otherwise unidentified.</note> and to one of the most curious figures in my childhood&#x2014;Mysie Hamilton&#x2014;or &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Meal-Mysie</hi>&#x201D; (she continuing her <pb id="pg-32-202" n="32:202"/>mother&#x2019;s flour trade.)<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Haddington, in the <date when="1820">1820</date>s, &#x201C;Miss Mysie Hamilton, a well-known, much respected Haddington person, lived in the first flat west of Cairns&#x2019;s Close for many years, and died well on to eighty-five years of age. In her younger days she kept a meal shop, and sold the famous Samuelston Meal made by Johnnie Begbie, and in doing so she had to enter as a burgess and guild sister. It was the practice, when new burgesses were made, for the Dean of the Guild and other magistrates to give the new batch a supper in one of the hotels. Miss Hamilton duly attended on the occasion and enjoyed the supper, and claimed a right to &#x2018;spice and wine&#x2019; as much as her new guild brothers&#x201D; (John Martine, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences of the Royal Burgh of Haddington</hi> [Edinburgh and Glasgow, <date when="1883">1883</date>]) 13.</note> She spoke with a loud <hi rend="italic">man&#x2019;s</hi> voice, that used to make us children take to our heels in terror when we heard it. I remember the Boys said Mysie was &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">hermophrodite</hi>&#x201D; (?) but what that was I hadn&#x2019;t a notion, nor have yet! My Mother thought her a good woman and once by way of lark invited her to tea</p>
<p>I bought a pamphlet, the other day, containing the whole &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Trial</hi>&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly John Morison, <hi rend="italic">A Complete Report of the Trial of Madeleine Smith, for the Alleged Poisoning of Pierre Emile L&#x2019;Angelier</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1857">1857</date>), but several other pamphlets claiming to be full reports of the trial were also pbd. in <date when="1857">1857</date>.</note> on <hi rend="italic">the very spot</hi> where Mysie Hamilton sold her flour!

<p><salute>My Little Dear,&#x2014;</salute>I know not what time I may have tomorrow (Monday); but I have happily an odd quarter of an hour today; so will write, and keep the thing open. Nothing is to be said; but I may as well say <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> in pen and ink.</p>
<p>I am up aloft at present, tho&#x2019; I have mainly been <foreign><hi rend="italic">sub dio</hi></foreign> [in the open air] today again. Yesterday &#x26; day before the wind had risen so high, and the temperature had so much sunk, I mounted aloft again;&#x2014;with plenty of wind it is not so ill here. Besides, to confess truth, I have had for about a week past a fit (villainouse<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> headaches, feverishness &#x26;c), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I at first attributed to <hi rend="italic">Oxtail soup,</hi> but now discover to be <hi rend="italic">cold,</hi> caught sitting in the sweep of the wind under that awning:&#x2014;I have put on my flannel again, taken other measures of a dietetic sort, and intend to be more careful how the <hi rend="italic">wind</hi> is.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have been at Proofs again all day (<hi rend="italic">second</hi> reading of the last set; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will <hi rend="italic">do</hi>); I am getting on, slow like an old spavined horse, but never giving in: the gloom of my soul is perfect at times, for I have &#x201C;feverish headache,&#x201D; and <hi rend="italic">no</hi> <pb id="pg-32-204" n="32:204"/>human company, or absolutely none that is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> ugly to me. One hope remains: that of <hi rend="italic">working out</hi> of this sad element; getting my Book done,&#x2014;and quitting London (I often think), or as good as quitting it,&#x2014;for the sake of fresh air, and dairy-produce in abundance! (&#x201C;Dinner, Sir!&#x201D;&#x2014;I will resume at night, then)&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">8&#xBD; p.m.</hi> I am on the groundfloor now; have done dinner and tea; and will write a little longer here, before going to <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets,</hi> the revising of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is my next work.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pbd. <date when="1858">1858</date>, vol. 13 of the cheap edn. of TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works;</hi> see <ref target="volume-32/ed-32-athanaeum-advertisements"><sic>appendix 1</sic><corr><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> Advertisements</corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I saw nothing in my ride, except the genial breezy summer ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> beautiful even in London; and a crowd larger than any I ever saw in my life (100,000 some guessed it) gathered round a conical tent with &#x201C;People&#x2019;s Band&#x201D; in it, in the Regent&#x2019;s Park.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The band of the First Life Guards, advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1857-07-21">21 July</date>, as performing, 4 o&#x2019;clock, Sat., <date when="1857-07-24">24 July</date>, admission 1s, children 6d.</note> I drew up for a moment to look at it from the distance: music (vile opera trash, I suppose) had paused; men, women, and children, all in their sunday clothes, and quiet tho&#x2019; lively, were moving, minutely but incessantly, far and wide, on their green floor under the sky: poor souls, after all!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410309-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>13:55</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1841-03-09">9 March 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> I found something respectable in this their success in getting a little wind-music for themselves, since all else was denied.

<p>Tait paints incessantly here, and seems to me to make no progress at all.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tait was doing preliminary work for his painting <hi rend="italic">A Chelsea Interior,</hi> of TC, JWC, and Nero in the downstairs drawing room.

<p>Nero is already begun <hi rend="italic">grunting</hi> for a sally out: I have reserved the <hi rend="italic">key</hi> while Anne is out; but I think I shall hardly use it. Nero lost me yesternight,&#x2014;the intolerable <foreign><hi rend="italic">messin</hi></foreign> that he is! I was hurrying home from a long walk, full of reflexions not pleasant; at the bottom of Cadogan Place<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On N side of Sloane Sq.</note> 11 o&#x2019;clock struck,&#x2014;time to <hi rend="italic">hurry</hi> for porridge:&#x2014;but the vermin was wanting; no whistle w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> bring him: I had to go back, whistling desperately all the way, as far as the old <hi rend="italic">Farrar-</hi>door (in Wilton Cresc<hi rend="italic">t</hi>),<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Off Belgrave Sq., where Annie Farrer&#x2019;s family had lived.</note> there the miserable quadruped appeared; and I nearly bullied the life out of him. He licked my milk-dish, at home, with &#x201C;the same relish.&#x201D; On the whole, however, my Dear, he is a real nuisance and absurdity in this house:&#x2014;and I do earnestly request you to <hi rend="italic">dispose</hi> of your hedgehog (at what he will bring),&#x2014;and, with the proceeds, or on independent funds, to buy a proper <hi rend="italic">nailing hammer</hi> in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or Fife, and bring that home with you as something useful: I do seriously! <hi rend="italic">Item,</hi> still more seriously, if you will buy me in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> the very biggest, best, stoutest-teethed <hi rend="italic">Pocket-comb</hi> you can get, it will be a beneficence. I perceive you will have to set earnestly about getting me some wearing apparel (not to speak of shirts, flannels &#x26;c) when you come home!

<p>I am down here beside the water-butt again; first of the morning was spent aloft; sky being cloudy and wind out: but I gradually got a headache, and came down with my <hi rend="italic">waste-basket</hi> in hand.

Maggie is the same little golden-haired impersonation of good-humour and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Practical Endeavour</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;And the place is all over roses and knots of ribbon as usual. They seem <hi rend="italic">heartily</hi> glad to have me with them; and I had new occasion to admire their hospitable politeness when I found that only a fortnight ago there had been the downbreak of a Cook&#x2014; and a new one to be sought up. Which fact neither Maggie nor Mary nor Walter made the least allusion to, in the different letters I had at Sunny-Bank from all three of them about my coming!

<p>The last cook was a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> Free church woman.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., a member of the Free Church of Scotland, generally seen as stricter and more sabbatarian than the established Church of Scotland.</note> She &#x201C;came in to Prayers&#x201D; one Sunday night in her morning gown, with bare arms, and &#x201C;flopped down on her chair disdainfully&#x201D; (Maggie said)&#x2014;Afterwards Maggie mildly remarked to her on her dress and said &#x201C;you know I like to see you tidy on Sundays&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh,&#x201D; says M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Free Church, &#x201C;for the matter of <hi rend="italic">that;</hi> there is so little difference made in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> house between Sunday and the other days of the week, that I quite forgot it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> Sunday&#x201D;!! Whereupon Maggie proposed to her to <hi rend="italic">leave</hi> and she cheerfully acceded.</p>
<p>My Aunt Grace came from Morningside in the omnibus with me to see me <pb id="pg-32-210" n="32:210"/>off&#x2014; After having settled myself on the omnibus and looked out a little at the lovely Braid Hills;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Two summits, 675 ft.

<p>On leaving the omnibus I stumbled on Colonel Hamilton Veitch<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hamilton Veitch (<date when="1804">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865">65</date>), soldier, probably in the Indian Army, later a gen.; JWC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Haddington schoolfellow and admirer&#x201D; (Hansons, <hi rend="italic">NE</hi> 541); he d. in India (see A.

<p>Lady Goderich said to me lately &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you like Lady Airlie? <hi rend="italic">I</hi> like her much! She is so affectionate and enthusiastic!&#x201D; So one would say indeed from that note to me; which I may call &#x201C;dear&#x201D; with more reason. I read your message to my old Lady<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Donaldson. Lady Airlie wrote, <date when="1857-07-22">22 July</date>: &#x201C;Kiss the grand old lady for me &#x26; tell her a far away woman will be better for the story of her life &#x26; love her&#x2014;tho she never saw her.&#x201D;</note>; and you should have seen the <hi rend="italic">blush</hi> that coloured her innocent face! It would have warmed your heart for hours after, as it did mine. At no age and at no point of moral worth, it would seem, does a woman get indifferent to the appreciation of her fellow-creatures.&#x2014; &#x201C;But, my Dear! she said, what on earth have you been saying of me to that young Lady? (she knew you were &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">young</hi>&#x2019; by instinct; for I had not told her)&#x2014;kiss <hi rend="italic">me?</hi>! Bless her young <hi rend="italic">foolish</hi> heart! If she saw me, she would find me an <hi rend="italic">unco</hi> concern to kiss"! And then she asked me a great many questions about you; showing by her interest in <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> how sensible she was to your interest in <hi rend="italic">her.</hi> And that sort of <hi rend="italic">womanishness,</hi> at eighty seven, is one of her chief attractions for me.</p>
<p>Anyhow I felt so well beside her, that I overstayed my time there, and could only get away at last, under promise to return, on my road home. Thus my stay with my Cousins must be much shorter than they expected, and it <pb id="pg-32-212" n="32:212"/>would be using them downright unkindly, to shorten it still further by an <hi rend="italic">escapade</hi> to Cortachy. Besides, tho&#x2019; a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> stronger in body&#x2014;and mind since I came to Scotland, I am still very easy to knock up, and very easy to <hi rend="italic">scare,</hi> and being arrived here only yesterday, I should need more days to recover from that odious &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">crossing,</hi>&#x201D; and to gather up my nerves for a wholly <hi rend="italic">new</hi> adventure, than <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will be remaining at your home. On &#x201C;the 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x201D; I think you said you would be going elsewhere. And so my Lady dear, I must content myself to keep your image as hitherto like one of those bright-coloured Chinese picture<supplied>[s]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> one sees, without any &#x201C;Background,&#x201D; &#x201C;to speak of&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is better so, is it not than that you should be <hi rend="italic">all background</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Airlie wanted JWC to visit her: &#x201C;just to shew you my home &#x26; then if you ever thought of me there wd be a background for your picture&#x2014;.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; as some people are!</p>
<p>I had a charming letter from poor Lady Sandwich the other day, in which she tells me M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is going with her, to Addiscombe, for a week&#x2014; I hope it is true; for he writes as if he were growing into a sort of savage, under his ten-shillings worth of calico, out in that wretched little garden! I trust in god, I shan&#x2019;t find him <hi rend="italic">tatooed</hi> when I go back, and that he has eaten Nero raw! The said dear little Nero writes to me occasionally&#x2014;Geraldine Jewsbury <hi rend="italic">holding his paw!</hi></p>
<p>I suppose to go to Addiscombe will be better than going nowhere; still a sadder place to go to <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> for either of these two, I can hardly figure.</p>
<p>And what must Loch Luichart look like to Lord Ashburton?</p>
<p>He (Lord Ashburton) came down to Chelsea, the evening I left it, and gave me a gold chain and bracelets of <hi rend="italic">hers.</hi> I had seen them on her when we went <hi rend="italic">together</hi> to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> the year before! Oh they made me so sick, these things!</p>
<p>My dear Lady Airlie; I slept ill last night, or more properly speaking didn&#x2019;t sleep at all, and so, having written enough for practical purposes, I had best conclude.</p>
<p>If one <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be dark oneself, one is bound at least not to ray out any of one&#x2019;s darkness, on &#x201C;others"!</p>

      <p>Oh my dear Jane, I was dreadfully shocked by that most unexpected, most sorrowful news! And pitied you most sincerely. I had the image of that child<note n="3" noteref="1130">The Aitkens&#x2019; youngest child, Alexander, d. <date when="1856-10-24">24 Oct. 1856</date>.</note> so fresh in my mind; his largeness, and health, and beauty quite struck me; tho&#x2019; not accustomed to take much heed of babies, seeing indeed little difference betwixt one and another of them. But that child was quite an extraordinary one&#x2014;and then you had suffered so much for him, and you seemed so fond of him! It was sore, sore to bear! and will leave a shadow on your heart all the rest of your life. But as you say, &#x201C;it is useless repining&#x201D;&#x2014;useless, at least to repine in words; for the poor human heart <hi rend="italic">will</hi> and <hi rend="italic">must</hi> repine under so cruel a bereavement, whether there be any use in it or no&#x2014;</p>

<p>The first collected edition of TC&#x2019;s works was published from <date when="1857-01">January 1857</date> to <date when="1858-12">December 1858</date>. This appendix gives the complete list of Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s advertisements (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> <date when="1856-12">Dec. 1856</date> to <date when="1858-12">Dec. 1858</date>) to help make clear the publishing history of the edition, particularly since the order in which the different works appeared differs from the volume order that they were to be given in <date when="1858">1858</date> in <hi rend="italic">The Collected Works of Thomas Carlyle in Sixteen Volumes</hi> (see below). Descriptions of publication of the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> are also complicated by the fact that the name of the edition varies in Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s advertisements for individual volumes. The first advertisement refers to the &#x201C;Complete and Uniform,&#x201D; and the next two to &#x201C;Cheap and Uniform&#x201D;; after that it becomes mainly the &#x201C;Cheap Edition&#x201D; until, in <date when="1858-01">January 1858</date>, it becomes the &#x201C;Uniform Edition&#x201D;; finally, the <date when="1858-12-11">11 December 1858</date> advertisement refers to &#x201C;Completion of the Library Edition, handsomely printed.&#x201D; We use &#x201C;cheap edition&#x201D; in our notes to volume 32, <date when="1856-10">October 1856</date> to <date when="1857-07">July 1857</date>, as this is the phrase most frequently used by Chapman &#x26; Hall in their advertisements in this period. TC himself had referred to it, earlier in <date when="1856">1856</date>, as a &#x201C;Collective Edition&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560507-TC-JAC-01"><sic>31:86&#x2013;87</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1856-05-07">7 May 1856</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560509-TC-JN-01"><sic>89</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1856-05-09">9 May 1856</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560720-TC-RWE-01"><sic>129</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1856-07-20">20 July 1856</date></corr></ref>). Chapman &#x26; Hall also issued a flier, <date when="1856-12-01">1 December 1856</date>, advertising the <hi rend="italic">Works;</hi> see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561205-TC-VL-01"><sic>42</sic><corr>TC to VL, <date when="1856-12-05">5 Dec. 1856</date></corr></ref>.</p>
<p>All volumes include a title page with the title of the work/s, the actual year of publication (<date when="1857">1857</date> or <date when="1858">1858</date>), and, if the work was multivolumed, its volume number. The 16th and last volume to be published, volume 2 of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister,</hi> includes, at the end of the volume, 16 title pages all dated <date when="1858">1858</date> and headed <hi rend="italic">The Collected Works of Thomas Carlyle in Sixteen Volumes;</hi> beneath there is the sequential volume number, from one to 16; these volume numbers are not in the same order as the order of publication (see Tarr 447&#x2013;48, where there is also a description of the edition). Below comes the name of the individual work/s and, where the work is multivolumed, the volume number of the work; e.g., the title page for <hi rend="italic">French Revolution,</hi> despite being published first in <date when="1857-01">Jan. 1857</date>, was &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">vol. vii. / french revolution: vol. i / &#x2026; / m.dccc.lviii</hi>&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-32/ed-32-athanaeum-advertisements"><sic>214</sic><corr><corr><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> Advertisements</corr></corr></ref>).</p>
<p>The same plates were used for more expensive editions of individual works; for example, <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays,</hi> 4 vols. (<date when="1857">1857</date>), leather-bound,</p>
<p><pb id="pg-32-214" n="32:214"/><figure><graphic url="volume-32-214-15.gif"/><p>Title page to be inserted into The French Revolution (1857), vol. 1, to make it vol. 7 of Collected Works (1858)</p><p><hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi></p></figure></p>
<p><pb id="pg-32-215" n="32:215"/>with marbled end-papers and fore-edges (NLS NG. 1173.d.6.). The pagination and text in these volumes are identical to those of the cheap edition.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> was first advertised <date when="1857-11-14">14 November 1857</date>; we have included the advertisements for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> as they contribute to a full record of Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s advertising for TC&#x2019;s works at this time.</p>

<p>The friendship of TC and Elizabeth Barrett began in letters. Writing to TC in <date when="1844">1844</date>, Barrett wrote of &#x201C;his genius&#x201D; and &#x201C;his teaching,&#x201D; as well as her own &#x201C;high respect&#x201D; and &#x201C;honest admiration&#x201D; (<date when="1844-08-14">Aug. 14</date>; Kelley 9:99). On the same day, she told Mary Russell Mitford that she had taken &#x201C;a great gasp of courage&#x201D; and sent TC a copy of her <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (Kelley 9:101). In his reply to Barrett, TC praised the volume but advised her, as he advised all poets, to write prose instead of verse (see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440910-TC-JBA-01"><sic>18:198</sic><corr>TC to JBA, <date when="1844-09-10">10 Sept. 1844</date></corr></ref>). Undaunted, Barrett wrote a significant portion of an essay on TC for R. H. Horne&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">A New Spirit of the Age</hi> (<date when="1844">1844</date>; see Kelley 8:353&#x2013;59), and referred to him as &#x201C;a gifted painter and poet&#x201D; who &#x201C;proceeds, like a poet, rather by analogy and subtle association than by uses of logic&#x201D; (Kelley 8:356). The next year, recalling TC&#x2019;s response to her poetry, she asked Robert Browning whether he shared her sense of TC as a poet:</p>
<q>For <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to have thought ill of <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, would not have been strange. I often think ill of myself, as God knows. But for Carlyle to think of putting away, even for a season, the poetry of the world, was wonderful, and has left me ruffled in my thoughts ever since. I do not know him personally at all. But as his disciple I ventured (by an exceptional motive) to send him my poems, and I heard from him as a consequence. &#x2018;Dear &#x26; noble&#x2019; he is indeed&#x201C;and a poet unaware himself; all but the sense of music. You feel it so&#x201C;do you not? (<date when="1845-02-17">17 Feb. 1845</date>; Kelley 10:81)</q>
<p>She remained &#x201C;ruffled&#x201D; by TC&#x2019;s attacks, and in a letter to Browning in <date when="1846">1846</date>, challenged his assumptions about poetry and the superiority of men such as Cromwell: &#x201C;[H]is praise for dumb heroic action as opposed to speech &#x26; singing, what is <hi rend="italic">that&#x201C;</hi>when all earnest thought, passion, belief, &#x26; their utterances, are as much actions surely as the cutting off of fifty heads by one right hand. As if Shakespeare&#x2019;s actions were not greater than Cromwell&#x2019;s!&#x201D; (<date when="1846-01-31">31 Jan.</date>; Kelley 12:39). But Barrett continued to believe that TC was &#x201C;the great teacher of the age,&#x201D; as well as &#x201C;a poet&#x201D; (Kelley 10:101), and when she finally met him with Robert (now her husband) in <date when="1846">1846</date>, they liked each other. The Brownings remained good friends with TC, traveling with him and the Ashburtons to Paris in <date when="1851">1851</date> and corresponding regularly (see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510928-TC-JWC-01"><sic>26:185&#x2013;89</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1851-09-28">28 Sept. 1851</date></corr></ref>). As Barrett Browning remarked to Mitford, &#x201C;[Y]ou come to understand perfectly, when you know him, that his bitterness is only melancholy, &#x26; his scorn, <pb id="pg-32-226" n="32:226"/>sensibility&#x201D; (<date when="1851-10-22">22 Oct. 1851</date>; Mitford 3:331). While she continued to respect and admire TC, by the time that <hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh</hi> was published in <date when="1856-11">November 1856</date>, Barrett Browning no longer needed his approval. Her popularity as the leading &#x201C;poetess&#x201D; of the age was confirmed by the sales of the book&#x201C;the first edition sold out in a week, and the second in a month.</p>
<p>But TC had strongly influenced Barrett Browning&#x2019;s conception of herself in the poem as a heroic woman of letters, and it is perhaps fortunate that she never read the marginal comments he made on the volume (<date when="1857">1857</date>) now in the Senate House Library. This annotated first edition (8vo., 18.8 x 12.0 cm., original red cloth, repaired) may have been the copy that Ruskin lent to TC (see Wilson 5:297), who then apparently lent it to someone else, for he wrote on the flyleaf: &#x201C;To be <hi rend="italic">returned</hi> (by and by), not being properly <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> / T.C. <date when="1857-02-03">3 feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s final comment on the poem is dated <date when="1857-01-12">12 Jan. 1857</date>). This may also be the copy (duly returned) that TC passed on to his sister Jean Carlyle Aitken: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh</hi> will evidently never be asked for again: <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> it therefore with my blessing&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570312-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1857-03-12">12 March 1857</date></ref>). From Jean, it presumably passed to her daughter, Mary Carlyle Aitken, for when the volume was later &#x201C;recased,&#x201D; the binder noted on the title page, &#x201C;Case / Miss Aitken.&#x201D; It was bought by Sir Louis Sterling, who gave it to University of London Library as part of his bequest in <date when="1956">1956</date>.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, TC&#x2019;s comments reflect the estimation of the poem that he gives to his brother in <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570125-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1857-01-25">25 Jan. 1857</date></ref>: &#x201C;[T]his Lady &#x2018;hath a good utterance of speech;&#x2019; but as to the thing <hi rend="italic">said</hi> with it, one asks Is it a thing at all&#x201C;A sad pack of people these rhymesters of our time!&#x201D; In the marginalia to &#x201C;Distilled to a mere drop, falling like a tear / Upon the world&#x2019;s cold cheek to make it burn / For ever&#x201D; (Reynolds 1:1008&#x2013;10), TC responds, &#x201C;<foreign>ach Gott!</foreign>&#x201D; (<date when="1857">1857</date>:37). Barrett Browning&#x2019;s &#x201C;Innocent, / My sister! let the night be ne&#x2019;er so dark, / The moon is surely somewhere in the sky&#x201D; (Reynolds 6:787&#x2013;89) prompts TC to exclaim, &#x201C;The facts? Come to the Facts!&#x201D; (<date when="1857">1857</date>:257). Also in the margin, TC repeats his call for poets to write in prose: &#x201C;How much better had all of this been if written straight forward in clear <hi rend="italic">prose</hi> utterance!&#x201D; (<date when="1857">1857</date>:41).</p>
<p>There are positive annotations, such as &#x201C;voila!&#x201D; (<date when="1857">1857</date>:39) and &#x201C;&#x2018;devilish fine!&#x2019;&#x201D; (<date when="1857">1857</date>:85), as well as ambivalent, such as at the end of book 2: &#x201C;fine spun, very&#x201C;cobweb?&#x201D; (<date when="1857">1857</date>:88). TC&#x2019;s humor is also apparent in many of the comments. For example, when Barrett Browning writes, &#x201C;We had a strange and melancholy walk: / The night came drizzling downward in dark rain&#x201D; (Reynolds 4:393&#x2013;94), TC asks, &#x201C;Why not call a cab?&#x201D; (<date when="1857">1857</date>:149). His ultimate comment on the poem, however, indicates rather more &#x201C;scorn&#x201D; than &#x201C;sensibility&#x201C;: &#x201C;A very beautiful tempest in a teapot. What a gift of utterance this high child has,&#x201C;and how very weak and childlike all it has to say. / <date when="1857-01-12">12 jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi>, 1857</date>&#x201D; (<date when="1857">1857</date>:403).</p>
<p><pb id="pg-32-227" n="32:227"/>The editors have had access to a transcription and photocopies of the Senate House volume that were completed by Rodger L. Tarr in the <date when="1970">early 1970s</date>. In addition, Hilary Smith, a former editor of the <hi rend="italic">CL,</hi> obtained another copy of a transcription from the late J. C. Walworth, who was special collections librarian at University of London Library in <date when="1994">1994</date>. All available transcriptions and photocopies have been rechecked against the original volume in Senate House. The editors wish to thank Tarr, Smith, and Alun Ford, administrator, Historic Collections, University of London Senate House Library, for their help.</p>
