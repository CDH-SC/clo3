<p>This volume shows a striking increase in the number of letters not published before, reinforcing the continued claim that the Carlyles&#x2019; story is incompletely known. In the past, several sources have been passed by and many generalizations ill-founded. Of the 316 letters in this volume, as many as 199 (or about 63 percent) have not been previously printed, compared with 51 percent in volume 25 and 47 percent in volume 26. Of the other 117 letters, 43 have appeared incomplete. Of them all, 269 were written by Thomas and 37 by Jane Carlyle, showing a slight fall in the number written by Jane, though what that signifies is partly uncertain. We have to take into account that she had given up writing regularly to her cousin, Jeannie Welsh. Perhaps she was growing increasingly withdrawn in this difficult year. Or the increase in the number of previously unpublished letters may be because editors and biographers have thought that what was happening between Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling</hi> and the history of Frederick the Great was less dramatic than earlier. But we certainly now have a chance to get a closer grasp of the Carlyles&#x2019; development at this time and a better basis for understanding them.</p>
<p>We gain this from detailed application to the actual letters, but some examples of how the letters more clearly define the story can be seen in a few of the Carlyles&#x2019; friendships and family relationships. For example, the death of Carlyle&#x2019;s mother at the end of the year may mark a special change in his development; the question persists of their relations with Lady Harriet Ashburton; and some of the Carlyles&#x2019; other friendships ask to be reconsidered, such as their association with Giuseppe Mazzini and a new one with Delia Bacon, an American Baconian to whom Carlyle was remarkably courteous and sympathetic.</p>
<p>The most important and moving event of the year was the quiet drama of the decline and death of Carlyle&#x2019;s mother, who had clearly begun to fail, though she still had all her senses. Once Peggy Aitken, an untaught farm servant and bankrupt farmer&#x2019;s daughter, she cheerfully kept up her spirits, being able to read &#x201C;the whole day if she have any Book worth reading,&#x201C; her tastes &#x201C;not at all silly or squeamish,&#x201C; but welcoming anything with a &#x201C;glimmering of human sense&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-26/lt-18511024-TC-AC-01"><sic>26:214</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1851-10-24">24 Oct. 1851</date></corr></ref>). Even so, the end had almost come, though for a while she was fortified with a supply of overproof &#x201C;whisky, porter, wine and brandy,&#x201C; until &#x201C;a bad turn&#x201C; in <date when="1853-07">July</date>. Jane Carlyle had been due for a holiday in the summer, calling at places in Scotland associated with her own mother, starting with a visit to Moffat and her brother-in-law, Dr. John. At <pb id="pg-28-x" n="28:x"/>once she was caught up in the alarm of the family in Scotsbrig, and she went to see her mother-in-law to report to Thomas. Jane wrote that Carlyle&#x2019;s mother had turned &#x201C;better rather than worse,&#x201C; recovering from her &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">natural</hi> strength,&#x201C; since Dr. John could do nothing against his &#x201C;Mother&#x2019;s sole disease,&#x201C; old age (<date when="1853-07-20">20 July</date>). The crisis was over for a few months, till it became so serious that Thomas was called.</p>
<p>Once he came, the account written to his brothers and sisters is even more powerful than his <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences.</hi> He tells how, on walking from the station, his one thought was, &#x201C;&#x2018;Shall I see her yet alive?&#x2019; She was still there; weary very weary, and wishing to be at rest. I think she only at times knew me; &#x2026; once she entirely forgot me; then, in a minute or two, asked my pardon&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, 152). He wrote to his brother Alexander that toward the end when he left the room, she sent his sister Jean to call him back &#x201C;with apologies, &#x2018;That I was Tom, that she knew me right wee&#x2019;l. &#x2026; She looked kindly at me, as she had done even in the worst pain, and she was now somewhat easier; I kissed her cold lips; and she took leave of me in these words, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m muckle obliged t&#x2019;ye,&#x2019; audibly whispered, which are forever memorable to me&#x201C; (<date when="1853-12-28">28 December</date>).</p>
<p>He recalled in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences:</hi> &#x201C;It was my Mother, and not my Mother; the last pale <hi rend="italic">rim</hi> or sickle of the moon, which had once been <hi rend="italic">full</hi>, now sinking in the dark seas. &#x2026; &#x2018;All the days of my appointed time,&#x2019; she had often said, &#x2018;will I wait, till <hi rend="italic">my change come.</hi>&#x2019; The most beautiful <hi rend="italic">religious</hi> soul I ever knew. &#x2026; On the <hi rend="italic">religious</hi> side, looking into the very heart of the matter, I always reckon her rather <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> to my Jane, who in other shapes and with far different <hi rend="italic">exemplars</hi> and conditions, had a great deal of noble religion too. Her death filled me with a kind of <hi rend="italic">dim amazement</hi> and crush of <hi rend="italic">confused</hi> sorrows, which were very painful, but not so sharply pathetic as I might have expected&#x201C; (152).</p>
<p>He noted the scene in his Journal, with further intimate details, and his response to an event &#x201C;henceforth memorable to me. &#x2026; It cannot be said that I have yet <hi rend="italic">learned</hi> this severe lesson I have got; I must try to <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> it more and more, or it will not pass from me&#x201C; (<date when="1854-01-08">8 January 1854</date>). It was to stay with him when dwelling on past or future problems: &#x201C;Poor old mother, father, and the rest of us bustling about to get dressed in time and down to the meeting-house at Ecclefechan. &#x2026; On the whole I have a strange interior <hi rend="italic">tomb</hi> life, and dwell in secret among scenes and contemplations which I do not speak of to anybody. My mother! My good heavy-laden dear and brave and now lost mother! The thought that I shall never see her more with these eyes gives a strange painful flash into me many time&#x201C; (Journal, <date when="1854-02-28">28 February 1854</date>).</p>
<p>Perhaps it marks a boundary in his life rather than a development. Sir Herbert Grierson&#x2019;s belief that her death released Carlyle&#x2019;s reserve about his religious skepticism seems mistaken. Like Gladstone, he supposed that Carlyle <pb id="pg-28-xi" n="28:xi"/>used a religious language &#x201C;to which he&#x201C; and his mother &#x201C;were accustomed,&#x201C; because he could not &#x201C;bear to give&#x201C; her &#x201C;pain&#x201C; (Grierson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle and Hitler</hi> [Cambridge, <date when="1933">1933</date>], p. 14; Gladstone Papers, BM. Add. Mss. 44776, f.6). But we have already seen how openly he wrote (<hi rend="italic">CL</hi> <ref target="volume-19/ed-19-introduction"><sic>19:x&#x2013;xi</sic><corr>19:introduction</corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-22/ed-22-introduction"><sic>22:xii&#x2013;xiii</sic><corr>22:introduction</corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-26/ed-26-introduction"><sic>26:xii&#x2013;xiii</sic><corr>26:introduction</corr></ref>); his outlook, relieved mainly by work, had already grown darker, and, with or without concern for his mother, he was outspoken.</p>
<p>He was always a man of contradictions and paradoxes; that he could also be extremely sensitive to others is shown, for example, by his reception of Delia Bacon, whom Emerson had rather too thoughtlessly passed on to him. Carlyle showed his gentler side when she called at Cheyne Row in <date when="1853-05">May</date> with Emerson&#x2019;s introduction. As his letters partly explain, she had come to England convinced that Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were really composed by a group led by Francis Bacon. She was extraordinarily single-minded, and far from easy to deal with, though she had found support from Emerson, the financier Charles Butler who had sailed with her from the States, Nathaniel Hawthorne and his admirer Francis Bennoch, and was to add various influential friends recruited by Carlyle. Her determination eventually led to her vigorous article on &#x201C;William Shakespeare and His Plays: an Inquiry Concerning Them,&#x201C; in <hi rend="italic">Putnam&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> (<date when="1856-01">January 1856</date>), and her weighty <hi rend="italic">The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakespere Unfolded</hi>, prefaced and subsidized by Nathaniel Hawthorne, and published in London in <date when="1867">1867</date> by Groombridge &#x26; Sons. She was to give good reason for Hawthorne to regret his support, and he was eventually to advise her to go back to Carlyle among others if she wanted another literary adviser (Theodore Bacon, <hi rend="italic">Delia Bacon</hi>, 281&#x2013;82).</p>
<p>The article made her the first Baconian in Britain or North America, though others quickly followed, such as William Henry Smith, who brought out a pamphlet <hi rend="italic">Was Lord Bacon the Author of Shakespeare&#x2019;s Plays? A Letter to Lord Ellesmere</hi> (<date when="1856">1856</date>). Some doubts had already been expressed about Shakespeare&#x2019;s works being by Shakespeare of Stratford, but it is hard to say why she put forward Bacon in his place, apart from her having the same name. The curious feature of her book is that it is almost entirely theoretical. She wanted to replace Shakespeare by Bacon not for any given biographical or historical reasons, but because thoughts and phrases in their works or their &#x201C;philosophy&#x201C; seemed alike. Her book speaks about temporarily withholding the &#x201C;historical&#x201C; part of her work, and of not wanting to deal with anything but their philosophy. For she declared that Shakespeare&#x2019;s works did not come from an unthinking &#x201C;brutish, low-lived, illiterate, unconscious spontaneity,&#x201C; but expressed the &#x201C;new philosophy&#x201C; of the &#x201C;Court of the last of the Tudors and the first of the Stuarts,&#x201C; and were originated by a &#x201C;reflective, deliberate and <hi rend="italic">designing</hi> mind&#x201C; (p. xviii). She argued that such Elizabethan wits and men of letters and science were disappointed and defeated politicians using the theater for political effect. This accounts, or was her excuse, for not <pb id="pg-28-xii" n="28:xii"/>wanting to listen to such experts as James Spedding, or to follow up other introductions and lines of inquiry that Carlyle gave her. Her work is well-written, and she was obviously convincing to such intelligent men as Emerson, Hawthorne, and Butler, who took a patriotic pride in her daring and persuasive eloquence. For his part, Carlyle, though sensibly skeptical and deeply opposed in principle to such theorizing, was unremittingly and chivalrously considerate and kind. In the end, in spite of her distaste for mere historical associations, she went on to haunt places associated with Shakespeare, whom she dismissed at other times as &#x201C;Lord Leicester&#x2019;s stable boy.&#x201C; Seeking for proof, she sought to have his tomb opened; and, mocked by reviewers, she died insane in <date when="1859">1859</date>.</p>
<p>The immediate result of her approach to Carlyle and his recommendation of J. W. Parker, was that after considerable delay her proposed article for <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> was rejected, as Carlyle had to tell her on <date when="1853-12-10">10 December</date>. Yet, as she was to tell Charles Butler, she was already pursuing her arguments in a substantial volume, which she expected to be ready in the form &#x201C;of a clear strong statement of the whole matter &#x2026; which will be able to stand alone.&#x201C; She had come to identify herself with the wits and scholars of the new philosophy of the &#x201C;Advancement of Learning,&#x201C; who she said were to be &#x201C;a means to the Advancement of the Welfare of the World&#x201C; (<date when="1854-01-01">1 January 1854</date>, Hopkins 183).</p>
<p>Her various biographers have not adequately told her story. We have a clue to her desire to escape from reality in one of Emerson&#x2019;s casually apologetic remarks about her having &#x201C;a private history which entitled her to high respect,&#x201C; which he thought could &#x201C;be helped only by facilitating her Shakespeare studies&#x201C; (to TC, <date when="1853-08-10">10 August</date>). Her history was what Carlyleans might call an &#x201C;open secret,&#x201C; and is perhaps associated with Emerson&#x2019;s tendency to make eminent men represent his own ideas, combined with his liking for paradox. Her story is too complicated to give in detail, but an unhappy love affair with a younger man, a broken engagement, and a series of misunderstandings, resulting in her betrayal or rejection by a Yale theological student, had led to an unfair inquiry conducted by academic authorities more interested in preserving their good name than hers. It ended in scandal and gossip, openly discussed and publicized in <hi rend="italic">Truth Is Stranger than Fiction</hi> (New York, <date when="1850">1850</date>) by Catherine Beecher (<date when="1800">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878">1878</date>), Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x2019;s sister and a prominent educator, writer, and reformer. For a while, Bacon had found relief in her great success as a teacher and public lecturer, as well as escape into her elaborate Baconian fantasy. Her friends obviously advised that this be diverted by a visit to England; and Charles Butler&#x2019;s academic and theological connections may have led him to sponsor her, though he otherwise kept a wise distance. Her story is told by Theodore Bacon, <hi rend="italic">Delia Bacon A Biographical Sketch</hi> (Boston and New York, <date when="1888">1888</date>), <pb id="pg-28-xiii" n="28:xiii"/>and Vivian C. Hopkins, <hi rend="italic">Prodigal Puritan: A Life of Delia Bacon</hi> (Cambridge, Mass., <date when="1959">1959</date>); but Delia Bacon has not featured before in Carlylean biography or letters.</p>
<p>In contrast, relations between Lady Harriet and the two Carlyles ran almost smoothly in <date when="1853">1853</date>. If Jane was reserved and somewhat distressed, it scarcely shows. She accepted that her husband should sometimes visit Addiscombe and the Grange without her, and she even found it convenient. The Carlyles speak of it openly; she is happy to back out of a visit when she has a cold. The year begins with her submissively presenting Lady Harriet with a pincushion and gratefully passing on Lady Harriet&#x2019;s gift of &#xa3;10 to a destitute friend, William Maccall. It ends with her being surprisingly willing to do what she deeply disliked by buying the cheapest possible presents for the Ashburtons&#x2019; annual children&#x2019;s Christmas party.</p>
<p>Carlyle usually writes to Lady Harriet as an intimate friend, mainly without the exaggerations he sometimes used (perhaps partly in self-mockery) as with, &#x201C;Before the Queen, so bounteous, gracious in all things. &#x2026; I kiss the hem of your garment&#x201C; (<date when="1853-11-28">28 November</date>), or, &#x201C;I mean to keep related to you, noble Woman of a thousand, and by all the means that Heaven permits me; and Heaven, I suppose, will not yet refuse to let me <hi rend="italic">think</hi> of you, whatever else is forbidden&#x201C; (<date when="1853-06-09">9 June</date>). The tone may be subdued, as he tamely signs off with &#x201C;Good be with you ever more,&#x201C; or just &#x201C;Yours ever&#x201C; (<date when="1853-11-08">8</date> and <date when="1853-11-11">11 November</date>). Yet he also writes with sensitive affection, drawing her into his memories when he is left alone with the cat, while Jane sets off to Reigate: &#x201C;Oh my noble Lady, do not ever you quite forget me,&#x2014;not if you can rightly help it! I wish this for reasons of my own,&#x201C; as he goes on to remember his first being taken to Annan Academy by his father one bright <date when="1853-05">May</date> morning (<date when="1853-05-18">18 May</date>). At another time, probably in late <date when="1853">1853</date>, he thanks her for a print of Friedrich Duke of Saxony by D&#xfc;rer, adding, &#x201C;Do not <hi rend="italic">give</hi> anything more, O my Bountiful; have you not <hi rend="italic">given</hi> me enough already, more than I can ever repay!&#x201C; (28:372). We have been denied Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s answering letters in reply, but a deep sense of friendship, at least on his part, is clear from his writing to her so promptly on his mother&#x2019;s death. Her tears of sympathy, he says, are &#x201C;still present to me; and no part of your noble goodness to me is or can be forgotten&#x201C;; she is his &#x201C;dear Friend&#x201C; (<date when="1853-12-23">23</date> and <date when="1853-12-25">25 December</date>).</p>
<p>Both the Carlyles sought friendship, and we cannot pass by the note of despair in Carlyle&#x2019;s Journal as, finding comfort in nothing but work, he writes of &#x201C;the worthless, empty, and painfully contemptible way in which (with no company but my own, with my <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> open) but as with my hands bound, I pass these days and months and even years&#x201C; (<date when="1853-04-13">13 April</date>).</p>
<p>He was never able to find an active outlet, unlike such friends as Mazzini whose apparently vain schemes, as Thomas and Jane observed, continued to erupt, as he struggled for Italian revolt and eventual freedom. He and the <pb id="lastpage-28-xiv" n="28:xiv"/>Carlyles had first come together about <date when="1838">1838</date> (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391206-TC-JSM-01"><sic>11:225</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1839-12-06">6 Dec. 1839</date></corr></ref>), gradually growing closer. Carlyle had recognized him, from the first, as a &#x201C;valiant, faithful, considerably gifted and noble soul,&#x201C; though &#x201C;hopelessly given up to his republicanisms, his &#x2018;Progress,&#x2019; and other lamented fanaticisms, for which I had at no time the least credence&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, 94). He was to go on by saying that &#x201C;we soon tired of each other,&#x201C; leaving Mazzini, &#x201C;off and on,&#x201C; to Jane Carlyle&#x2019;s share, &#x201C;for a good many years, yielding her the charm of a sincere mutual esteem.&#x201C; In crisis, Jane had turned to Mazzini for help (<date when="1846-07">July 1846</date>; <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460706-JWC-TC-01"><sic>20:222</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1846-07-06">6 July 1846</date></corr></ref>). Carlyle always had a deep personal respect for Mazzini, supporting him as &#x201C;a man of true genius, an honourable and gifted man&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-12/lt-18400425-TC-HC-01"><sic>12:117</sic><corr>TC to HC, <date when="1840-04-25">25 April 1840</date></corr></ref>); but even the admiring Jane had had misgivings about some of his plans, including the serious proposal to take her with him on an invasion of Italy by balloon (<date when="1842-10-22">22 October 1842</date>; <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421022-JWC-JW-01"><sic>15:141</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-10-22">22 Oct.</date></corr></ref>).</p>
<p><date when="1853-02">February 1853</date> brought the foredoomed fiasco of the Milan uprising. We have to see Mazzini as justified by his hope that such failures were part of a sustained long-term revolution. Yet Carlyle was neither alone nor wrong in his immediate response to the news from Milan as a &#x201C;mad insurrection.&#x201C; Perhaps, he told his mother, Mazzini was a man &#x201C;of much worth,&#x201C; who &#x201C;could not well <hi rend="italic">help</hi> its taking place&#x201C; (<date when="1853-02-13">13 February</date>), but to Clough he declared that the rising was &#x201C;insane.&#x201C; It left Mazzini badly shaken, but still content to surround himself with a circle of admirers, and immediately ready to return to violent revolt. There was nothing reactionary in the belief of both Carlyles, in company with most Italians, that &#x201C;it all ends in blood&#x2014;and that is horrible&#x201C; (JWC to JAC, [<date when="1853-09-07">7?

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>This will be delivered you by a young James Carlyle, a Newphew<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> of mine (eldest son of my youngest Brother), who has lately quitted agricultural Annandale for some kind of Business life in your big City. He starts in some subaltern department of the Caledonian-Railway Office; and, of course, ought to improve and expand himself with his present opportunities, and become gradually fit for better. He is an honest hearted, solid, amiable lad; and I think does not want for talents, if he choose to struggle sufficiently in exercising and cultivating them.</p>
<p>Whether you can do anything for him, now and then, in the way of countenance, protection and advice, I do not know; but if you can at any time, I am very sure you will for my sake; and so I leave it with you and him and the chances that may turn up between you.</p>
<p>I send my kind regards and friendly old remembrance to &#x201C;Baillie&#x201C; Hope,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Hope, Glasgow merchant (see next two letters) who had been a councillor for district 4, Glasgow, <date when="1836">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846">46</date>, but not apparently a bailie.</note>&#x2014;to whom also pray recommend this Nephew of mine if there arise opportunity. I do not know the good Baillie&#x2019;s address,&#x2014;nor yours either <hi rend="italic">well;</hi> but yours better than his; and so have begun with you.</p>
<p>May the New Year (which begins here in bleak mud-deluges, not of one kind only) end better with us all than the Old did: &#x201C;may the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of our days be <hi rend="italic">past</hi>,&#x201C; as poor Edward Irving used to say!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430107-TC-JWI-01"><sic>16:9</sic><corr>TC to JWI, <date when="1843-01-07">7 Jan. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I have addressed the inclosed Letter to Mr Glen according to all the light I have; &#x201C;Messrs Dunlop,&#x201C; as your Uncle the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> bade me:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1853-01-02">2 Jan.</date></note> I think you might well have some difficulty with such an indication; but suppose it to be all right <pb id="pg-28-2" n="28:2"/>nevertheless, and that you will find Mr Glen, with not much asking. He used to have a Business and Office of his own (if I mistake not); but has probably changed his mode of procedure in late years.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Glen was a commission merchant, 86 Miller St., with his home at Kelvingrove Pl., Royal Ter.</note> He is a very kindly, intelligent and pleasant man, whose company might be agreeable and useful to you now &#x26; then, if you were fairly acquainted with him.

But I suppose I need not instruct you in these small particles, by this time.</p>
<p>The Mr Hope, mentioned in the Letter, is still better known to me,&#x2014;and is an extremely kind, <hi rend="italic">douce</hi>, cheerful and successful Annandale man:&#x2014;if you wanted a special Note to him, find out his Address (&#x201C;Fleming &#x26; <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi>&#x201C; was in old times &#x26; perhaps still is the title of the <hi rend="italic">House</hi>),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hope was a merchant, 49 W.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>For the sake of <hi rend="italic">Auld lang syne</hi> let me recommend to you the Bearer of the Note, an honest Annandale Nephew of mine, who has come to live and work in Glasgow, in the <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> line<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As a clerk.</note> (not writing of <hi rend="italic">Books</hi>, thank Heaven!)&#x2014;and <pb id="pg-28-3" n="28:3"/>might be greatly profited by a &#x201C;paternal eye&#x201C; (like yours) being occasionally cast upon him and his affairs. He has of course much need of culture in all ways; but is docile and ductile, and has faculty enough, I believe, if he make a good use of it. Whatsoever you can easily do in this matter (if you find anything can be done) I do not <hi rend="italic">ask</hi> of you, knowing you will do it without asking.</p>
<p>I was thunderstruck to learn, last summer, that your Brother William, my old schoolfellow and patron, was off to California!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William J. Hope, whom TC knew while at Edinburgh Univ.; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350611-TC-DH-01"><sic>8:143</sic><corr>TC to DH, <date when="1835-06-11">11 June 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> The distressed man in whose behalf you once gave me a reference to him,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> never more made his appearance here: so I had no new communication with William,&#x2014;and, alas, am far out of the road of any as matters now have come to stand! Who can say whether he is not perhaps <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> in this enterprise, after all?</p>
<p>I am much oppressed by the mud and rain here,&#x2014;and indeed in general by the &#x201C;contradiction of <hi rend="italic">sinners</hi>&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heb. 12:3.</note> (reckoning <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> first in that sad lot);&#x2014;nevertheless I do, from the bottom of my heart, wish you a right &#x201C;happy new year&#x201C; and &#x201C;many of them,&#x201C; and what is still better, <hi rend="italic">good</hi> and worthy ones, as heretofore;&#x2014;and am always (with feelings truly of an <hi rend="italic">old</hi> date now,&#x2014;ah me!)&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Thank you dearest Lady for your letter, and thank you too in the name of Macall.</salute><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521230-TC-LA-01"><sic>27:385</sic><corr>TC to LA, <date when="1852-12-30">30 Dec. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> God knows but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> ten pounds may be the saving of him from insanity and utter ruin! For when I posted off to Wandsworth<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >London suburb, S of the Thames.</note> after reading your letter, I found that tho&#x2019; better, he was still too ill for any <hi rend="italic">head</hi>-work and that this very morning he had been trying for the first time to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> some newspaper-criticism&#x2014;the thing by which he earns his bread. Tho he did not tell me so; I could easily see that he had been driven on this work by &#x201C;cleanness of teeth&#x201C; (as the bible calls it)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amos 4:6.</note> and he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not have gone on with it <hi rend="italic">yet</hi>, <pb id="pg-28-4" n="28:4"/>without aggravating his malady. Ten pounds in the hands of such a manager as his wife will keep them <hi rend="italic">comfortably</hi> for as many weeks&#x2014;and his poor head may rest itself a while longer. His illness is very horrid&#x2014;what Esquirol<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean &#xc9;tienne Dominique Esquirol (<date when="1772">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840">1840</date>), French alienist, a founder of modern psychiatry.</note> calls, I think, <hi rend="italic">suicidal mania</hi>. His reason is as clear as ever it was but for three weeks he <hi rend="italic">durst</hi> not take a razor in his hand feeling irresistably tempted to cut his throat&#x2014;and at the same time he had no <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to die&#x2014;he told me this himself; that no agony he had ever dreamt of was to compare with this struggle he lived in against his temptation to turn every sharp instrument against himself, and even against his wife and child whom he loves intensely! Sometimes he had to beg them at dinner to go out of the room &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Still</hi>,&#x201C; he said today, &#x201C;I <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> not shave myself and make them keep away all knives&#x201C;&#x2014; I was sitting alone with him, and felt a little uncomfortable, he looked at me so strangely&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wonder if <hi rend="italic">any</hi> motive justifies one in telling a premeditated elaborate <hi rend="italic">lie?</hi>&#x2014;such a lie I told him, heaven forgive me&#x2014; To a proud man &#x201C;not obtruding his difficulties on others,&#x201C; I could not say, &#x201C;Lady Ashburton hearing of your illness sent you this money.&#x201C; So I went &#x201C;about it and about it&#x201C; and gave him to understand that you knew of him by his writings&#x2014;which however I told him jestingly you thought should be burnt by the hangman, and then I went on to say that I had happened to mention his indisposition to <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> and what a nice little child he had got, and that you had kindly sent me ten pounds to buy a present for <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, and that I not knowing what to buy would like they took the money and expended it themselves&#x2014;Perhaps he saw thro&#x2019; my fable at any rate he seemed much affected, and drawing his hand over his face which became very red&#x2014;he said&#x2014;&#x201C;You judged rightly that <hi rend="italic">money</hi> is indeed what is most needed here&#x2014;at the same time we obtrude our difficulties on nobody&#x2014;should try to do so to the last possible moment&#x2014;I have heard of Lady Ashburton as a person very superior to ordinary fine Ladies&#x2014;it is the <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi> in which such a kindness is offered that makes it pleasant or painful&#x2014; I accept Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s kindness <hi rend="italic">gratefully</hi> since you vouch for the spirit in which it is offered and will you tell her that&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that I thank her</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; He was so much agitated that I ordered him to put on his hat <hi rend="italic">and</hi> walk a part of the way home with me&#x2014;and I am sure <hi rend="italic">your</hi> charity and <hi rend="italic">my</hi> chattering did him a world of good. he took leave of me, looking quite animated&#x2014;</p>
<p>Here is a pincushion (to replace the dirty white one) which should have gone on new years morning, but for an unlucky accident&#x2014;it is not yet &#x201C;the coming <hi rend="italic">pincushion</hi>&#x201C; which has so long been haunting my head&#x2014;<hi rend="small-caps">three</hi> have tried themselves and been pronounced bad&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">this</hi> is neither good nor bad; but it is better than the old white one when I saw it last oh <hi rend="italic">so</hi> dirty!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We are now in the beginning of a new Year, when old accounts are summed up, and old recollections sad and joyful are gone into; and I will delay no longer, what I have been thinking of this great while, to send you again a word <pb id="pg-28-6" n="28:6"/>of direct writing from me. It is indeed a long time since I have written: alas, I have been so whirled about for many months, I have not written a line, except upon compulsion, to anybody; and am very seldom, even if time were plentiful with me, which it never is, in a case to write anything that could be cheering to a Brother far away! Never mind, let me write at last; and try if I can be more punctual in time coming!</p>
<p>Last summer early, in <date when="1852-06">June</date> I think, it was, after study and consultation enough, decided by my Helpmate and me, that we should finally <hi rend="italic">abandon</hi> the speculation of ever getting out of this place; that we should secure a long lease (31 years, <hi rend="italic">long</hi> enough!) of this solid old House, &#x201C;thoroughly repair it according to our mind,&#x201C; and decide on being quiet here henceforth. On the whole I found that it must be so. Nearly every year since I came to live here, especially in late years since there was a <hi rend="italic">possibility</hi> for me of getting elsewhither, I have madly struggled, in my thoughts, expressed or not, to be out of this horrible uproar of London, and into some place of country quiet and fresh air: but, alas, it always ended with the mere struggle and without any victory; the chains were too heavy for me. Scotland, when I go back to it, is little other than a place of graves to me; I wander there like a ghost among the living,&#x2014;a common lot at such years as mine now are. And to settle down, as a hermit and stranger, without work out of doors or the chance to form new relations, in some solitary place in England&#x2014;alas! Not to say that my Wife was always silently against giving up our advantages here:&#x2014;in short, I gave it up, as you perceive; and have now, for anything I know, <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with dubitating on the matter.&#x2014; Well, we set about getting our House &#x201C;thoroughly repaired&#x201C;; fairly <hi rend="italic">began</hi> about the <date when="1852-07-01">first of July</date>, I think; and&#x2014;are not properly done <hi rend="italic">yet!</hi> Let me not speak of the affair; it is really one of the abominablest jobs I have ever been engaged in; and has cost me, in money paid and misery suffered, more than I care to think of at present! &#x201C;Six weeks&#x201C; was the time set, and &#xa3;200 the sum guessed: if double the sum, &#x26; six times the time, get me fairly thro&#x2019;, I suppose it will be well, as things have proved!&#x2014; However, let us not murmur: the House really is very much improved; has been comfortably <hi rend="italic">habitable</hi> ever since <date when="1852-10">October</date>, and with a 3 weeks of papering and painting (in this chief room, where I now am, and where my books and work are), were the long days once come again,&#x2014;we shall <hi rend="italic">actually</hi> have <hi rend="italic">done;</hi>&#x2014;and, I believe, shall not be in haste to begin a similar job again while we continue here! Often have I thought of you, my dear and helpful shifty Alick, while all this was going on! How you carried us thro&#x2019; a tenfold harder-looking business at Puttock<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Craigenputtoch; see vol. 4.</note> once, and at quite another rate of charges:&#x2014;in fact, had <hi rend="italic">you</hi> been here, it had not taken us the dance it has, in any respect whatever. For above all things, the thing we have wanted all along has been a <hi rend="italic">Master of the Works:</hi> our Builder <pb id="pg-28-7" n="28:7"/>has been without faculty that way, tho&#x2019; otherwise an honest reputable painstaking man,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Morgan.</note> whom I have <hi rend="italic">pitied</hi> and <hi rend="italic">paid</hi>,&#x2014;what else could I do?</p>
<p>However, the thing I had to say was: About the middle of <date when="1852-07">July</date>, all being dust noise and desolation here, and the weather blazingly hot, Jane, who alone had the superintendance, sent me off to Scotland to be out of the way. I was in a most wrecked bilious condition, and glad enough to go. I sailed to Dundee; staid 3 weeks or better with a Mr Erskine<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Erskine.</note> a friend of mine in that quarter; then came down to Annandale, staid 4 weeks there, still weak, sleepless and very ill off indeed,&#x2014;but in hopes my own home w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> soon be ready for me again. Alas, it became now evident that there was no chance of that for other four weeks or more. Jane sent me off to Germany, she and others; I went for some six weeks into that Country, was at Berlin, at Weimar,&#x2014;scenes full of sorrowful and other interest to me, had I been in any tolerable condition as to body; but I was not! I got no right sleep any night, often no sleep at all; grew every day more weakly wretched; and in fact do not remember six such weeks, for vile suffering of various kinds, in all my life. I hurried home again; resolute to have done with that at any rate. Early in <date when="1852-10">October</date> I got home; but it was not till the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of the month that I could fairly live here (painters &#x26;c &#x26;c still haunting us); I think it was in <date when="1852-11">November</date> when I first flung myself fairly <hi rend="italic">down;</hi> and said, &#x201C;Well then, let me sink as <hi rend="italic">low</hi> as gravitation carries me; I will have <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>, whatever befal!&#x201C;&#x2014; That has been my posture, &#x201C;lying at the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">dead sea</hi>&#x201C; ever since;&#x2014;and that will explain why I have been so remiss in writing among other things. I think I never was more &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">brashed</hi></foreign> to pieces,&#x201C; or have been in such weak gloomy humour; holding my peace, keeping diligently mute: that was nearly all I could do; and that I have hitherto pretty honestly done.&#x2014; Quietly, however, let me say: <hi rend="italic">in the rear</hi> of all this wretchedness I feel as if my <hi rend="italic">health</hi> even were not fundamentally hurt, but rather were clearer and improved; also that perhaps I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> get some <hi rend="italic">good</hi> of my sight of Germany yet; that the House will be better and perhaps the man better;&#x2014;and in brief that all shall be well that <hi rend="italic">ends</hi> well, as we have seen it sometimes heretofore! Do not distress yourself therefore about my vociferous extensive <hi rend="italic">complainings</hi>,&#x2014;not too much;&#x2014;you know of old, it is in some sort the &#x201C;nature of the beast.&#x201C; And now, after a whole sheet of worthless lamentations (which I was far from <hi rend="italic">intending</hi>, but cannot now help), let us turn from the so remarkably unfortunate <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi> Carlyle, and speak of other members of the family, a little.</p>
<p>Scotsbrig is still the most interesting of all places; Scotsbrig, where our poor old Mother is,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Aitken Carlyle.</note> I will first speak of. Ah me, she is now very old and weak; <pb id="pg-28-8" n="28:8"/>lies mostly in bed I believe in this dark season of the year. In the autumn time I found her feeble, but clear, <hi rend="italic">lively</hi> after her weak sort, and very seldom in bed thro&#x2019; the day. However, she took small &#x201C;ill-turns,&#x201C; and the least thing was now able to overset her. She walked with me sometimes to the Fairy Brae;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-25/lt-18501115-TC-AC-01"><sic>25:284</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1850-11-15">15 Nov. 1850</date></corr></ref>.</note> seldom farther. She was peaceable in mind; intellect &#x26;c clear as ever; but the <hi rend="italic">light</hi> of her old life, so far as joy or satisfaction of any kind went, was waxing dim, not now the cheerful <hi rend="italic">sun</hi>light, but pale grey twilight,&#x2014;alas, alas, it is the inexorable law; and no love of ours can deliver this loved life from the universal lot! They are kind to her, all of them, as they can contrive to be: she reads a great deal, all kinds of clever books are still interesting to her; reading is her chief resource.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written, <date when="1852-01-02">2 Jan.</date> that she had been reading three books he had given her, &#x201C;thereby somewhat relieving the monotony of her life in that windy room of hers. One of these books was the Scottish Worthies in good large print.&#x201C;</note> One of the Austin lasses (Margaret it was in <date when="1852-09">Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>, and I think again is)<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was.</note> always stays with her; waits upon her handily and with due attention. She was fond of talking when in moderate health; fond especially of talking to me, whom she had not always with her. Oh my Brother, I do not know that you should regret being cut off from that spectacle; especially if, like me, you only had it from year to year! I can recollect no bitterer moments than these I have of parting from My old Mother, and leaving her so!&#x2014; Well, well; in fine, <hi rend="italic">she</hi> is in God&#x2019;s hand, as we all are; and surely He will do what is <hi rend="italic">right</hi> and <hi rend="italic">best</hi> with that dear old Mother and with us: let us try if we can say, His will, not ours, be done in all things!&#x2014; I write almost weekly, not quite, to my Mother; Jack<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. John Aitken Carlyle, m. to Phoebe.</note> is also still often about her; and I think there is no lack of care about her, on all hands.</p>
<p>Jack, as you doubtless know long since, has got married,&#x2014;contrary to calculation of many! He was busy about that enterprize, running continually to Moffat &#x26;c all the time I was there; so that I did not get much communication with him, and little or none of an intimate nature. He has since been here, with our new Sister; staid a couple of weeks in Chelsea here in lodgings near us; was very happy and good; and I liked his <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi> very much after a sort. A tall Ladylike person enough, not beautiful but handsome enough and healthfully agreeable; has sense enough, and I think is of cheerful temper and honest heart, which are great qualities. She seems very fond of her new husband: and in short I concluded they might fairly hope to be a real and considerable addition to each other&#x2019;s comfort. Jack has got a home and other advantages;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;I have a little tidy room upstairs, on the second story, where I now write; &#x26; to this I retire every morning after breakfast &#x26; remain alone if I choose till <supplied>[1:30]</supplied>.&#x201C;</note> she a guardian to her 4 boys and ditto. She is said to have &#x201C;plenty <pb id="pg-28-9" n="28:9"/>of money&#x201C;; how <hi rend="italic">much</hi> (whether &#xa3;1,000 a year or twice that sum) I never know.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had thought she had &#xa3;4,000 a year; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521105-TC-JN-01"><sic>27:349</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1852-11-05">5 Nov. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; They are living now and till midsummer next, at Moffat (as you doubtless are aware) in a House of Hope Johnstone&#x2019;s<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John James Hope Johnstone (<date when="1796">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876">1876</date>); see Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:5. A wing of the house was reserved for his factor, Charles Stewart, who stayed every Friday; &#x201C;with him we have abundance of talk.&#x201C;</note> opposite the Star H&#xF4; tel,&#x2014;an <hi rend="italic">uppish</hi>-looking stout old mansion with court &#x26;c, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I daresay you remember. He writes me frequently, a short very short Note; and seems to be down at Scotsbrig once every 7 or 8 days to see our Mother. It seemed to me as if she would not like that method of his help less than the old one, where perhaps anybody <hi rend="italic">constantly</hi> beside her might be a disturbing influence at times to one so weak.&#x2014; &#x2014; The rest of our kindred were all well, and doing rather well; these times being brisk for trade of every kind,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">so long</hi> as the game lasts, that is; but I look for the inevitable &#x201C;crisis&#x201C; again, and a <hi rend="italic">change</hi> of game by and by; such as we have known before to be the rule!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It is better to send you a poor short Note than none at all: so here goes,&#x2014;certainly in &#x201C;haste&#x201C; enough! I have been unusually weak and out of spirits for the last week or two;&#x2014;nothing wrong either, except the old sad story of liver, and the <hi rend="italic">etcetera</hi> which, in one degree or other are perennial with me:&#x2014;but I have been quite solitary for most part, silent as a stone; trying to be busy a little, too; twice at the Museum<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >British Museum Lib.</note> (with due headache in consequence): add to which the weather is usually very dark muddy &#x26; discouraging:&#x2014;in short, things have been, and are, in a very chaotic and disturbing state with me. Today, for example, we had again a man repairing tiles in the roof; and I have just had to write for the Plumber, whose <hi rend="italic">cisterns</hi> (blessings on them!) <hi rend="italic">whistle</hi> in the morning, sometimes for hours, and peremptorily invite the British Subject to get out of his bed who is within hearing of them! But all these things will settle themselves by and by, will they not? Or &#x201C;come to the same ultimately,&#x201C; which is about as good! I wrote an immense Letter to Alick last week; and nothing else whatever but briefest Notes, and upon sheer compulsion.</p>
<p>People have no other news to tell one another here, except daily the state of Gladstone&#x2019;s Poll at Oxford: lost so many today; gained so many.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Aberdeen&#x2019;s new coalition govt., Gladstone became chancellor of the exchequer necessitating a by-election for the Oxford Univ. seat, <date when="1853-01-20">20 Jan.</date> Dudley Spencer Perceval (<date when="1800">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856">1856</date>), fourth son of the assassinated prime minister Spencer (<date when="1762">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1813">1813</date>), stood against him, running a scurrilous campaign and reducing his majority.

It seems G. is <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> of his election, if he liked to <hi rend="italic">trouble</hi> his friends with mustering. My own private view, which many share, is, it would be better both for him and Oxford, at least suitabler, if he <hi rend="italic">lost;</hi> along with Oxford he will never get &#x201C;pulled straight,&#x201C; but continue in the labyrinth of Pusey crotchets;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Anglo-Catholic faction of Puseyites (who strongly supported Perceval) was named after one of its leaders Edward Bouverie Pusey (<date when="1800">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">1882</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22910"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).</note> and for Oxford itself, what so proper result as to send forth their Dudley Percival (a crazy Phantasm in his century) and say openly, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">This</hi> is <hi rend="italic">our</hi> man!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>You also, it appears, have had some electioneering at Moffat:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Lord Drumlanrig had just been reelected MP for Dumfries county; he was MP there, <date when="1847">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856">56</date>; Archibald William (<date when="1818">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858">58</date>), later 7th marquess of Queensberry.</note> a big letter with a Printed Speech in it, came to me the other day,&#x2014;directed, I suppose, to <hi rend="italic">every</hi> Elector;&#x2014;to which I could only respond ejaculatively &#x201C;<foreign>Allah Akbar</foreign> [God is great]!&#x201C; not understanding anything about the controversy, and being completely impartial as to the man.&#x2014; It is certain, however, all people are greatly contented with this last change of Ministry; and the new broom, which has never yet been laid to the floor, is expected to sweep in an uncommonly effectual way. Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I remember Eben<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Johnstone right well from the very beginning of my life; and am much interested and affected by what you record of him. The last time I saw him is still very vivid before me. A night now near five-and-thirty ago,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Years&#x201C; omitted. Ebenezer Johnstone was postman in Ecclefechan and had asked after TC when calling at Scotsbrig on <date when="1853-01-01">1 Jan.</date> (JAC to TC, <date when="1853-01-02">2 Jan.</date>). TC evidently lodged with his mother about <date when="1818">1818</date>, or probably earlier. See <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530317-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1853-03-17">17 March</date></ref>.</note> when I lodged with his good old Mother, and E. and I wandered about the Moffat streets, talking together; since the morrow after that night, I have never once seen him: I was on my road to Kirkcaldy, and he&#x2014;had no staggering in his feet at that time! Good Heavens, it looks only yesterday, or like a dream of the night!&#x2014; Give my kind and sympathetic regards to him; his is a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Zeitbild</hi></foreign> [image in time] I can never forget while I continue in this world of Time.</p>
<p>I am getting very scant of news about my poor old Mother: your Note was the last. I designed to write to her today; but cannot now till tomorrow. You should send me some brief bulletin whether I write or not. To Jamie at Glasgow I sent the due Notes, if they can be of any use to him. How is Madame? We hope the cold is gone, and that she takes precautions, and does well in the <pb id="pg-28-12" n="28:12"/>bad wet weather. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother.

<salute>My dear good Mother,</salute>
<p>It is truly longer than usual, and too long, since you have had a little word of writing from me. I am kept in a terrible bustle; but I should not neglect that! This is the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> day that I have resolved on doing this little bit of pleasant duty; but only now can I get it done; always hitherto some vile thing or other has come in the way. I will be more resolute, and use better despatch, in time coming!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have properly no news here, none at all: our quiet way of life continues, and our wet weather, and other puddles outward and inward, have not ceased either! We should be thankful for the health we have, both of us; if we use our <hi rend="italic">besom</hi>-machinery (and &#x201C;sweep&#x201C; honestly and well),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The mechanical broom designed by Joseph Whitworth; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470927-TC-JWC-01"><sic>22:94</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1847-09-27">27 Sept. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> the &#x201C;puddles&#x201C; do not gain quite the upperhand, after all.&#x2014; Jane is out just now; gone out to enjoy the dry day (for there is a clear breeze from the <hi rend="italic">North</hi> today) among so many wet. She complains of defective <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> &#x26;c, but still goes hardily about, and indeed I think is stronger than in past years. She reads now with specs in the candle-light, as well as I;&#x2014;uses her Mother&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">specs</hi>, I perceive;&#x2014;and indeed looks very well in them, going handsomely into the condition of an <hi rend="italic">elderly</hi> dame. I remembered your <hi rend="italic">joy</hi> over <hi rend="italic">specs</hi>. Old age is not in itself matter for sorrow; it is matter for <hi rend="italic">thanks</hi>, if we have left our <hi rend="italic">work</hi> done behind us! God deal with us in <hi rend="italic">mercy</hi>, not in rigour, on that head,&#x2014;as we trust it will be for the faithful of us:&#x2014;but in fact it is not a serious person&#x2019;s sorrow, surely, that he is getting <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of the battle; that he sees the still regions beyond it where is no &#x201C;battle&#x201C; more forever. God is great; God is good!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack sent me a little despatch about you on Saturday; for which I was very thankful. Ask Isabella to bear me in mind in that respect, when there is danger of defect otherwise:&#x2014;I should like rather more description sometimes than John gives me of your way of life: alas, I can <hi rend="italic">do</hi> nothing for you dear Mother; I can only sit passive in the distance, and look on with all the sympathies of my heart! I wish I did know anything I could <hi rend="italic">do</hi>.</p>
<p>Two Newspapers came today; but I fear they are neither of them worth much. The <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> is growing very <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> in late weeks; and I often think of <pb id="pg-28-13" n="28:13"/>trying the poor <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> again,&#x2014;which, alas, is perhaps <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> if one actually saw it!</p>
<p>On Saturday night we went out to dinner; the first time these good many weeks,&#x2014;to a brave enough kind of man called Brookfield, a kind of Clerical <hi rend="italic">School</hi> Inspector, who lives in this neighbourhood, and has a great regard for my precious self and d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> spouse: the dinner was very well; loud-talking, by men of name, all brilliant, all &#x26;c<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brookfield wrote in his diary, <date when="1853-01-15">15 Jan.</date>, that among others at the dinner were Henry Hallam, historian; Tom Taylor (<date when="1817">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880">80</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27090"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), dramatist and journalist; James Spedding, and Anthony Coningham Sterling (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:384).</note>&#x2014;I was very glad to get home again to my pipe and weekly-newspaper. Unhappily there is no other way here of seeing one&#x2019;s friends; and to me it is a very unsuitable way. Lockhart&#x2019;s son (Sir W. Scott&#x2019;s sole grandson) is dead,&#x2014;he had been behaving ill, and much grieving his father, who is also said to be unwell of late:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Scott Lockhart, who d. <date when="1853-01-10">10 Jan.</date>, was the son of TC&#x2019;s old friend, John Gibson Lockhart (<date when="1794">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854">1854</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16904"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210128-TC-WG-01"><sic>1:317</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1821-01-28">28 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>).</note>&#x2014;the Scott family is now nearly all gone,&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>I will write <hi rend="italic">sooner</hi> next time dear Mother; at present <foreign>adieu</foreign>.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I had been repeatedly thinking of writing to you; but your Letter of yesterday brings me to the point. Alas, I am terribly bothered here, and hunted from post to pillar; and rarely get more than a hardly visible fraction of my own mind accomplished with my own time! I wanted to ask you about sending out some bottles of good port or other wine, or good brandy, to my poor Mother, for a New-Years Gift; but I am so totally in the dark about what might be of any real use to her, that there is no good decision to be arrived at easily. She has been (I gather from the Dr&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle.</note> very brief descriptions) rather worse than usual, during this sad dark weather; but seems at present to be round to the ordinary point again. By all means, go if you can to see her with your own eyes; and give me the fullest account in your power after you return. Consider also about this small Gift of <hi rend="italic">wine</hi> or whatever else, and give me some rational advice about it.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jack writes from time to time; but his Notes are of the old brevity, of the old <hi rend="italic">fugitive</hi> sketchy character; and seldom give one a clear picture of anybody&#x2019;s situation, even of his own. I gather, however, that he seems in superior spirits, and much happier than heretofore,&#x2014;having made a lucky conquest in this new change of life. Poor fellow, he has had <pb id="pg-28-14" n="28:14"/>enough of the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> way too; long wandering without fixed home in this world: we will heartily rejoice in his new acquirements, and hope with some confidence that he has made a real improvement in his way of life.</p>
<p>Nothing particular is passing here with us; the old linsey-wolsey story of weak health, bad weather, and many <hi rend="italic">outward</hi> evil elements, very indifferently borne up against, or made good, by heroism of <hi rend="italic">inward</hi> endeavours! I am pestered even with <hi rend="italic">paper</hi>, at a great rate; and obliged, as you see,&#x2014;on this kind of paper at least,&#x2014;to try writing with <hi rend="italic">iron pens</hi>, and endure their melancholy contradiction! My one remedy, as usual, is <hi rend="italic">work;</hi> in the world I have nothing else to look to with hope of benefit;&#x2014;and yet, in spite of my struggles, I do not get well on at present with any work that is visible at all; tho&#x2019; I don&#x2019;t consent to be <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> either (in which case I should, before long, probably need a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">place by mysel&#x2019;</hi>&#x2018;&#x201C;),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350128-TC-JCA-01"><sic>8:21</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1835-01-28">28 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> but keep fighting along <hi rend="italic">under</hi> ground, in hopes some day of getting <hi rend="italic">above</hi> it.</p>
<p>The other night, you can tell Aird, I took a long walk thro&#x2019; lanes, over heights, and by new unknown streets (4 miles or more in all) to visit a Dr Samuel Brown, friend of A.&#x2019;s and mine, an amiable and clever man, who has lately removed hither, with his young Scotch Wife, for a shelter &#x26; living. I found them both at home, at the very outmost Northwestern Corner of Babylon,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., London.</note> amid half-built houses, trenches, mud and new bricks (for Babylon is rapidly extending on that and every side), in a nice little modest house, in a d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> room,&#x2014;playing an innocent game at <hi rend="italic">whist</hi> together. A nice scene, and nice good pair, whom I have often tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of since. They were overjoyed to see me; and we talked a long time,&#x2014;my walk, with long strides, home again, thro&#x2019; the sleeping suburbs under the windy moonlight, was not unpleasant. Brown (grandson of Bible-Dictionary Brown)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Brown (<date when="1722">1722</date>&#x2013;<date when="1787">87</date>) of Haddington, biblical commentator; author of the well-known <hi rend="italic">Self-Interpreting Bible</hi>, 2 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1778">1778</date>).</note> is truly a genial kind of soul, whom it was <hi rend="italic">pathetic</hi> to see launched upon London. He at present complains a little on the old score; but hopes soon to be equal to a Chelsea visit; and indeed I look forward to pleasant meetings now &#x26; then with such a man. A pious and gifted man; but in London in the year &#x2019;53: &#x201C;poor fellow, after all!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Today I send a <hi rend="italic">Jamieson</hi> for reading (or rather <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi> to whom it belonged sends it);<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Anna Brownell Jameson, <hi rend="italic">Legends of the Madonna</hi> (<date when="1852">1852</date>).</note> not worth much I guess!&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> &#x26; <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> (monthly) and the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> (quarterly).</note> go regularly to my Mother; and <hi rend="italic">went</hi>, the other day. Would you rather that I sent them <hi rend="italic">first</hi> to Dumfries;&#x2014;under conditions, of course, that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are to forward them to Scotsbrig? The <hi rend="italic">newness</hi> of them is, I suppose, no object to my Mother: nor indeed do I know that she cares much about them at all.&#x2014; Acertain how this <pb id="pg-28-15" n="28:15"/>is (in a quiet way!) when you go to Scotsbrig; and tell me for yourself what I am to day<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; &#x201C;acertain:&#x201C; thus in MS.</note> with next <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Take this Note-of-hand for our well-being at present, rather than nothing at all in the week now ending. Your last Note had crossed mine on the road; the appearance of it here was very welcome. I hope, according to Isabella&#x2019;s expectation, you made out your journey to Scotsbrig, and will report to me soon. My poor Mother, I can perceive, is very frail indeed: alas, alas, I often enough reflect, it <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be otherwise: one of the saddest of all the sad thoughts that visit the solitary chambers of one&#x2019;s mind in these times. Give me what best description you can.</p>
<p>We have been considerably out of sleep for the last ten days; but [word(s) missing] it is all right now, &#x26; that <hi rend="italic">last</hi> night&#x2019;s composure is the first step in the &#x201C;ould tram-way&#x201C; again. Poor Jane sleeps ill at any rate;&#x2014;and the poor neighbour, right-hand, has lately been inspired by the Evil Powers to institute Poultry in his premises and even a Cock! Think of that. After sad meditation, and some ineffectual trials otherwise, I called him in last night; spoke earnestly with diplomatic politeness to the poor man; offered him a gold sovereign for the <hi rend="italic">head</hi> of this fatal cock, indicating darkly withal that it <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not &#x201C;thrive&#x201C; in that confined place (Gambardella&#x2019;s gun,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spiridione Gambardella (see <ref target="volume-26/ed-26-biographical-notes"><sic>26:294</sic><corr>26:biographical note</corr></ref>) had once offered to shoot an offending cock; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451001-JWC-TC-02"><sic>20:6</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1845-10-01">1 Oct. 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> corrosive-sublimate,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mercury chloride, a poison.</note> armed fishing rods, and I know not what, having loomed in the distance, as he crowed!),&#x2014;and, in fine, I hope now the thing is finished in a fairly human <pb id="pg-28-16" n="28:16"/>manner!&#x2014; We have seen as good as nobody; done nothing, except dreary old German <foreign><hi rend="italic">Geschichtsb&#xfc;cher</hi></foreign> [historical books] I, in a very feeble manner. Our days however are lengthening, our sky clearing; we look for better times coming soon. How is Phoebe and her poor cold; how is the household; how you and your work?&#x2014; If you have any Books, Jean w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> evidently be very glad of them. I sent her one, worth little. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother: my lo<supplied>[ve is not]</supplied> so small as my Letter!</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>

<p><salute>Dear Neuberg,&#x2014;</salute>What in the world has become of you? We have expected you any evening these three weeks; and begin to fear you are not well! On Sunday evenings especially we are apt to be at home;&#x2014;and any day when you are in Town, surely it would give us pleasure to see you, if we could!&#x2014; However, if the weather were once a little brighter, I mean to take Hampstead on hand, and try for myself.</p>
<p>Mean time, on Tuesday evening the celebrated &#x201C;Miss Williams <hi rend="small-caps">Wynne</hi>&#x201C; is expected here to tea, perhaps even the celebrated &#x201C;M. Mont&#xE9;gut&#x201C; of the <hi rend="italic">R&#xE9;vue des 2 Mondes</hi> (a very small but good representative man): if you could come and join them and us, perhaps it would amuse you for an hour. You need not write or appoint; only come if you can.</p>
<p>We have been rather out of sorts, sleepless &#x26;c for the last ten days, I think; but are now about <hi rend="italic">par</hi> again;&#x2014;very deep in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Reichs-Geschichte</hi></foreign> [traditional German history], one of us; which is a dark section indeed of Nox and Chaos! No <hi rend="italic">dumber</hi> people have been found, not even the English, than these respectable Teutonic cousins; what great actions they have done, what great platitudes (mere <hi rend="italic">silence audible</hi>, a dreadful kind of <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>) they have uttered about them! I think it is &#x201C;the nature of the beast.&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Isabella,</salute>
<p>About two days ago came an illustrious sack of Hams; and a few hours <hi rend="italic">afterwards</hi> your Letter, explaining (what we had already guessed) from whose kind hands they were. We give many thanks to the bounteous souls <pb id="pg-28-17" n="28:17"/>that provide us with such good things; and shall often remember Scotsbrig, and you and my good old Mother while these two Hams do their duty! Such thoughts may well give new relish to every morsel of the excellent food; and might indeed sweeten into excellence a far less savoury article. We can only say again, we are greatly obliged; and will wish, May they that give so well never want!&#x2014; The Carriage was only 3/6;&#x2014;the hams are beautiful to look upon; and are hung up duly till their time come. We must <hi rend="italic">despatch</hi> with our bacon, it would appear! For Walter Welsh, the Minister, had just sent us a small sample of his skill in that way (accompanied with a <foreign>lock</foreign> of oatmeal, which was equally supernumerary), and some other friend of Jane&#x2019;s has <hi rend="italic">since</hi> left us another specimen of Ham,&#x2014;guessing our talent in that direction! Give us time, we shall handsomely get thro&#x2019; the whole (I have no doubt), and clear the decks in a triumphant manner. Many thanks all round.&#x2014; Of late I have begun, and Jane frequently with me, to <supplied>[have]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> a small portion of <hi rend="italic">porridge</hi> for supper again: I do not think we ever had better oatmeal; the taste is excellent, and there is not a vestige of irregularity or impurity in it. I am happy also to report altogether well of the butter this year: how much of it remains I know not,&#x2014;too little, not too much, I guess!&#x2014;but it comes up daily; and has a most unexceptionable flavour, sound to the heart,&#x2014;which makes us thank the <hi rend="italic">salt</hi>, tho&#x2019; otherwise not welcome in such a combination.</p>
<p>We continue in the old state of health; better <hi rend="italic">today</hi> than is quite common; for last week, owing to various irregularities and annoyances round us, had been rather below par (poor Jane sleeping badly, and I not in a superior manner), till now when we have got matters put straight again, and hope to go on with the old measure of success. The weather still continues &#x201C;open&#x201C;; often enough rainy, never any trace of frost, but occasionally now with glimpses of bright breezy sky, which are very agreeable, and prophesy that Spring is coming by and by. The very lengthening of the days is a cheering alteration: we, in spite of all our gas-lights and shining streets, feel it such; and you, without any artificial lamps, must feel it still more. In late years they have set the <hi rend="italic">Paupers</hi> to sweep our streets after every rain; flocks of these ugly gentlemen (a set of gluttonous spendthrifts mostly, of very coarse and wicked countenances) are to be seen, all about, each with his <hi rend="italic">brush</hi>-besom or <hi rend="italic">claut</hi>;&#x2014;and the weather, this winter, has given them copious employment. They make the street all as clean as a kitchen-floor; but if rain fall, it will all be muddy again on the morrow.</p>
<p>My good old Mother, I can perceive, is very frail and often very poorly and ill! Alas, how can she be strong;&#x2014;she has a strength in her which is wonderful. Oh, I wish I knew in any way how to help her: but I can do nothing;&#x2014;I can <pb id="pg-28-18" n="28:18"/>only beg and intreat of you all, as the <hi rend="italic">greatest</hi> kindness that could be done <hi rend="italic">me</hi> by far, to assist her with all the strength, patience and goodness you can. As I know you do!&#x2014; You will read this Note to her, I conclude; and assure her, what she already knows well enough, of my perpetual affection.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jamie, I think, will do well at Glasgow: if he improve his opportunities (as I hope), and be wise and diligent, there is no fear of him. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Isabella. Jane joins in love to you all</salute></closer></p>

Your little letters are little out-bursts of sunshine in the general London fog of my heart&#x02014; I wish they came oftener, or rather I wish yourself came oftener&#x02014;when that confounded room upstairs is papered and painted and a <hi rend="italic">spare bed</hi> once more mounted in it, surely it will not be so impossible for you to come to London now and then.</p>
    <p>What a pity it is that nobody can pour out M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x02019;s coffee entirely to his mind except myself&#x02014;and nobody but myself keep a steady enough eye to his buttons! otherwise I might, for anything I see, go and be myself that anomalous &#x0201C;Lady&#x0201D; required in your establishment&#x02014;but that &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">otherwise</hi>&#x0201D; is a useless element to think and project in&#x02014;one may go at once to the beginning of all and say &#x0201C;pity Eve <hi rend="italic">would</hi> eat that confounded raw apple; &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">otherwise</hi>&#x02019; we might all have been running about naked in Paradise still! and living on uncooked vegetables <foreign>Ach gott</foreign>!&#x02014; <hi rend="italic">Here</hi>, just now it is liker the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> place!&#x02014; Wherever I look there is misery of &#x02018;some&#x02019; sort&#x02014;or what strikes me almost <hi rend="italic">more</hi> painfully&#x02014;the dead grimacing <hi rend="italic">incapacity</hi> of being <hi rend="italic">miserable</hi> when one ought <hi rend="small-caps">to</hi>!</p>
    <p>By way of what my old servant Helen<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Helen Mitchell.</note> used to call &#x0201C;a fine change&#x0201D; I rushed off the other day to call for a young actress&#x02014; She was introduced to me last summer by Geraldine Jewsbury and Dilberoglue, the Greek who gave me <hi rend="italic">Nero</hi> (blessing unspeakable and only comfort sometimes!) and her gaiety and humourous and dramatic views of life amused me immensely&#x02014; So now she had got an engagement at the Olimpic and returned to London<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1853-01-17">17 Jan.</date>, advertised Miss Anderton&#x02019;s first London appearance at the Royal Olympic Theatre in <hi rend="italic">Lilian Gervais</hi>, adapted by Morris Barnett from the French.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It is Saturday afternoon, past 3 o&#x2019;clock, when I ought (had not things gone against me, and kept me back) to be out walking: however, I will not let the week end without sending you a short word, to say at least that nothing is specially wrong with us here. Poor Jane, indeed, has had a bad night,&#x2014;&#x201C;no sleep at all,&#x201C; poor creature,&#x2014;and is not in the best order, as you may think. But we hope she will do better tonight;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; on the whole, she is often ill off for sleep just now, in the bad cold weather, cold and <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> too, as it often is, tho&#x2019; not today;&#x2014;and it is surprising how she holds out notwithstanding; and daily keeps the road, when there is dry footing on the streets.&#x2014; As to myself, tho&#x2019; I have a great feeling of <hi rend="italic">thin-skinnedness</hi>, and am but shivery in the nerves, I seem to feel otherwise better than usual, and (especially when <hi rend="italic">well let alone</hi>) do very well. I am as busy to<supplied>[o]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> as I can manage to be, amid the many distractions around me; and so struggle along in the old tolerable manner. Mostly we are quite alone at present, at least I am, for nobody gets up to me here in work-hours: last night we had a certain Sir James Stephen with his son and Spedding,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Stephen, his son James Fitzjames, and James Spedding.</note> who all volunteered to come here: Stephen is a wise religious and sensible man; and talked a great many excellent things (he governed all the Colonies a long time; and is really a clever man, independently of his love of me!)&#x2014;and I could not grudge a 3 hours spent in <hi rend="italic">such</hi> conversation; which, however, is very rare here, with our crowds of busy and &#x201C;great&#x201C; men, the more is the pity!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesterday I wrote a hurried word to John about the Craigenputtoch <hi rend="italic">Lime</hi>-affairs; and have referred him to Jamie; before whom the whole case is to be laid for a decision. From Jamie I will expect, therefore, a candid verdict; let him do his wisest!</p>
<p>Jack represented you as rather fresher than for some time past: I know he always puts the best face on the matter:&#x2014;and alas, I know too, my poor old Mother is very weakly at the best: but ought we not to be thankful that things are as they are, since not better? Oh yes, yes: if human beings were not very stupid, they would feel themselves to be (as the old devout people said) &#x201C;monuments of Mercy.&#x201C;&#x2014; Now as always, dear good Mother, if there is <hi rend="italic">any</hi>thing I could do or get for you,&#x2014;why do I not know it? Alas, there is not anything; and I even fear you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have a scruple to tell me if there were. I can only wish the <hi rend="italic">sun</hi> were back: that, it seems to me, will do you and the rest of us more <hi rend="italic">good</hi> than most things we are like to get.&#x2014; &#x2014; Tell Isabella the butter <pb id="pg-28-24" n="28:24"/>continues <hi rend="italic">excellent; ditto</hi> the meal; the <hi rend="italic">Hams</hi> patiently await their fate, which is advancing daily! It was very kind of our good old mother to send us a Ham; <hi rend="italic">such</hi> seasoning cannot lie in any other piece of meat.&#x2014; I still shave daily with my Annandale bar of soap; but it will be done by and by, I perceive: however, there is some good to be had here now too, so never mind.&#x2014; Has Jean ever come down to you? She talked of it. <closer><salute>God&#x2019;s blessing on you, dear Mother!&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Goethe-Charlotte Documents;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe&#x2019;s letters to Charlotte Sophie Henriette Kestner, b. Buff (<date when="1753">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828">1828</date>), whom he fell hopelessly in love with and who was the model for Lottie in his <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi>. The letters were being ed. by her son, August Kestner (<date when="1777">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853">1853</date>), a friend of Bunsen&#x2019;s, in <hi rend="italic">Goethe und Werther. Briefe Goethes, meistens aus seiner Jugendzeit</hi> (Stuttgart und T&#xfc;bingen, <date when="1854">1854</date>).</note> which I propose to examine by the first opportunity of leisure I have,&#x2014;some time this week, I hope.</p>
<p>I would so gladly obey your commands, and those of Charity, both at once: and yet I fear I shall not be able to do this little thing you require of me in the name of that Divinity!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ettlinger speculates that since the Kestner family was apparently adverse to publication of the letters, August Kestner was trying to find someone with the authority to vouch for their value (261&#x2013;62). Bunsen apparently wanted TC&#x2019;s opinion on the possibility of a market for the book in Britain (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530304-TC-CKJB-01">TC to CKJB, <date when="1853-03-04">4 March</date></ref>) and may also have suggested TC write a preface; see below.</note> My studies at present are far, far on the other Pole, from Werter and his sentimental Pistol:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Werther shot himself in despair at unrequited love.</note> I have never in the least liked Werter;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See, e.g., &#x201C;Goethe,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 26:211&#x2013;20.</note> and Werter<hi rend="italic">ism</hi> in these sad generations is a thing I daily regard with more and more abhorrence! Had Goethe never done better, than <hi rend="italic">Werter</hi>, he had been no man of mine. Of course I shall read, as all the world will, with prurient curiosity, if not with a thousand other feelings which are due to them, the letters young Goethe wrote to young Madame: but I confess to a considerable shock from the <hi rend="italic">Frau-von-Stein</hi> affair;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Goethe and Charlotte von Stein (<date when="1742">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827">1827</date>), see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18481229-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>23:194</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1848-12-29">29 Dec. 1848</date></corr></ref>. Bunsen wrote, <date when="1853-02-04">4 Feb.</date>, &#x201C;I would not call upon you to preface the <hi rend="italic">Frau von Stein</hi> correspondence. She was a cocquettish, altho&#x2019; (I believe) virtuous wife, conscious of soliciting immortal songs from the genius of the Man who adored her, and too vain to stop his aspirations.&#x201C;</note> and questioned always, or rather did not question, the propriety of publishing to a gaping mob such extremely private passages in the history of my hero. The letters to Charlotte, <pb id="pg-28-25" n="28:25"/>it appears from your description, fall under quite another category, and deserve to be published. At any rate I can see well that, unless burnt, they must be published some day or other. As above said, I undertake to read them with at least prurient curiosity: but to stand sponsor for them, and recommend the reading of them to the world,&#x2014;to which I would, if I could, in my present savage humour, <hi rend="italic">recommend</hi> far other things;&#x2014;all the Prudences admonish me against this!</p>
<p>For the rest, it surely cannot be a difficult matter to secure a preference for the translation you patronize? The first of all conditions will be that the translation be <hi rend="italic">good</hi>. That being achieved (which is not quite simple in the case of Goethe), it will surely only require that you, or I, or any person of known credibility in such a matter, certify in these lines: &#x2018;Here are authentic Documents on the genesis of your delightful <hi rend="italic">Werter</hi>, O Public; they are <hi rend="italic">well</hi> translated; and the produce of the edition is for a charitable object: you will not pirate such a translation; you will respect it, and read it a great many of you!&#x2019;&#x2014;Or if this won&#x2019;t do, and piracy still ensue; then will it not be the best of all monitions to a certain Gentleman to commence representations and negotiations and forthwith get so iniquitous and foolish an arrangement, profitable to nobody, set upon the same footing?&#x2014;In fine, however, the goodness of the translation is your bower-anchor: of course if that is not attained, nothing either is, nor altogether ought to be, attained.</p>
<p>These are my crude notions; which I write, not to lose time:&#x2014;it is always my desire, and partly even my purpose of late, to see you &#x2018;one of these days&#x2019;; but, alas, it never takes effect! I must add a few words on another subject which you touch upon in this kind message of last night, and which, ever since I saw you last, have been more or less in my head. I mean the Portrait of Frederick the Great; which it seems somebody is copying, with a view to England, perhaps even to our esteemed self,&#x2014;gratifying, tho&#x2019; not needful in that quarter!</p>
<p>I know Pesne&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Portrait of Fk as Crown Prince</hi> very well; I found it in the Berlin Gallery, in the Schloss,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Antoine Pesne; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521007-TC-LOA-01"><sic>27:325</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1852-10-07">7 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:373, 15:325.</note> and I think a third time somewhere: a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Picture, and of a beautiful youth (more like his mother than he afterwards grew); there are authentic copperplates of it in the British Museum; and on the whole I have a copy of it privately in my own head to a sufficient degree. Unless the Artist employed is first-rate, and the copy to be in oil, a perfect fac-simile of <hi rend="italic">Pesne</hi> and intended for some sumptuous Gallery, it will not be of much use here.</p>
<p>There is, at Charlottenburg, a still more beautiful Picture by the same Pesne, representing Fk as a child of 3 or 4 years, beating a little drum, with his elder sister (Margravine of Baireuth afterwards) and a negro valet looking <pb id="pg-28-26" n="28:26"/>on:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:opp. 370, 371&#x2013;74; his sister, Wilhelmina Frederika Sophie (<date when="1709">1709</date>&#x2013;<date when="1758">58</date>); m., <date when="1731">1731</date>, Friedrich of Bayreuth.</note> this I remember as quite an excellent Piece, and Fritzchen as the prettiest little <hi rend="italic">eaglet</hi> of a child I have almost anywhere seen pictured: of this too, or of this especially, a man who had a Gallery of Pictures might rejoice to possess a <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> copy;&#x2014;and indeed I think, if our National Gallery were completely up to the <hi rend="italic">ideal</hi> of its duty, it wd take care to have them perfectly copied, and hung up to general view. Alas, alas!&#x2014; These two pictures I well enough know; and they are worth copying on the terms just indicated, but hardly otherwise. They are the only two <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Pictures of Fk that are known at Berlin; the only two on which one can at all depend for resemblance; and they are not of Fk <hi rend="italic">the Great</hi> (being so young), but only Fk <hi rend="italic">preparing</hi> to be great. It seemed to be made out by the best authorities that Fk <hi rend="italic">never</hi> sat for his Portrait to anybody after he was King; and accordingly the number of bad and impossible Portraits of Fk, in Germany and out of it, is very great. The modern Berlin Artists, I could see, have adopted a kind of <hi rend="italic">Compromise</hi> Fredk, a general &#x2018; <hi rend="italic">Average</hi> of Fredericks&#x2019;; which is current everywhere but to me quite worthless, fully as like an old Chelsea Pensioner<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A military veteran living at the Royal Chelsea Hospital.</note> as a Great Man; this you could get in any Printshop as the adopted &#x2018;Portrait of FredK&#x2019;; this, with Chodowiecki&#x2019;s contemporary sketch (not C.&#x2019;s best by any means, tho&#x2019; of some worth, and often repeated by C.), seemed to be all one <hi rend="italic">could</hi> get:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521007-TC-LOA-01"><sic>27:326</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1852-10-07">7 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and truly the resources of the Berlin Galleries, and Archives and Libraries, and of German Literature and <hi rend="italic">Vorstellungskunst</hi> generally, in reference to Fredk and his Heroes, were by no means nor are, of an exhilarating nature to me! Rauch&#x2019;s Portrait, of course, I saw daily&#x2014;of which you have now a cast; but that also seemed mainly the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Compromise</hi> Fredk&#x2019; current in the shops; and neither it, nor any of the other Portraits, in that magnificent expressive mass of Sculpture, would in the least kindle itself into life for me, but <hi rend="italic">refused</hi> absolutely to represent the reality of Fk and his Ziethens and Seidlitzes,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hans Joachim von Zieten (<date when="1699">1699</date>&#x2013;<date when="1786">1786</date>) and Friedrich Wilhelm Seydlitz (<date when="1721">1721</date>&#x2013;<date when="1773">73</date>), Prussian cavalry gens. For Rauch&#x2019;s monument in the &#x201C;Unter den Linden,&#x201C; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521007-TC-LOA-01"><sic>27:325</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1852-10-07">7 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and left me to my sorrowful reflexions. The <hi rend="italic">Dead Mask</hi> of Fk&#x2019;s Face<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Made by the sculptor Johann Eckstein (d. <date when="1798">1798</date>) of Potsdam.</note> seemed to be all I was to get about him, of credible, from Berlin Art.</p>
<p>In this perplexity, Professor Magnus (a man of much fame in Berlin, and well deserving of it) took me with him, one day, to the House of the Bankers <hi rend="italic">Schickler</hi> (I forget in what street; but they are <hi rend="italic">Splittgerber&#x2019;s</hi> successors and known to everybody); there, he said, was a Picture by Graff of Dresden, by far the best Portrait he had ever seen of Fk.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521007-TC-LOA-01"><sic>27:325</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1852-10-07">7 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> We went; and I saw this Portrait, and <pb id="pg-28-27" n="28:27"/>shall never forget it. This it seems to me is the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> FK, worth all the Busts, and Prints and Smearings I have ever elsewhere seen; the one Picture which corresponds both with the Dead Mask, and gives you those living eyes,&#x2014;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">ces grands yeux</hi>,&#x2019; as Mirabeau defines them, &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">qui portaient, au gr&#xE9; de son &#xe2;me h&#xE9;roique, la s&#xE9;duction ou la terreur</hi>&#x2019;;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Those large eyes that conveyed, in accord with heroic soul, allurement and terror&#x201C; (<date when="1786-09-24">24 Sept. 1786</date>; cited <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:2).</note> eyes and a look, not easy for a Painter to represent! I was, and am, quite charmed with that Picture:&#x2014;and, to come to the practical conclusion, will earnestly recommend to whoever is copying a Portrait of Fredk for English objects, to go thither and copy that, for it will be a real acquisition to us. Any kind of <hi rend="italic">faithful</hi> copy of the impression produced by that Picture wd be a possession to all students of the History of Fredk; and in fact it is the only Picture of the <hi rend="italic">elderly</hi> Fk, out of the half hundred Pictures, Busts etc. etc. I have seen in my travels, which is of any considerable value to me.</p>
<p>Magnus had undertaken to get this Picture accurately copied for a Russian Count Demidof<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prince Nicolai Nikolaevich Demidov; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521007-TC-LOA-01"><sic>27:326</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1852-10-07">7 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> (or some such name) by an Artist he could depend upon for making a facsimile. On my return to England, Lord Ashburton requested me at once to bespeak a similar copy; which I immediately <supplied>[did]</supplied>:<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> but Magnus wrote in answer that when they took down the Picture from Schickler&#x2019;s rather dim wall, and brought into full daylight, there were found to be faults, the head was out of drawing etc. etc.; and in fine they had renounced copying it. Which I was extremely sorry to hear. I urged in return: &#x2018;Surely it is possible for Painter&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Kunst</hi> <supplied>[art]</supplied> to give me faithfully that <hi rend="italic">impression</hi> I got from the Piece on Schickler&#x2019;s wall: <hi rend="italic">correct</hi> the evident faults of drawing (Graff had to paint from his own thought and memory not from a sitter); correct them, or leave them uncorrected; but procure us that impression!&#x2019; Magnus seemed again to hesitate; but he was just setting out for Spain with Winterhalter;<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Franz Xavier Winterhalter (<date when="1805">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873">73</date>), German portrait painter living in Paris.</note> and in fine nothing was done.</p>
<p>A certain Marble Bust (I know not by whom) which I saw in the Schloss (<hi rend="italic">old</hi> Schloss) at Potsdam appeared to me to have considerable resemblance to a conceivable Frederick:<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to Ettlinger, Eckstein made a bust from his death mask; this may be the one TC refers to.</note> but except that, these three Pictures (Pesne&#x2019;s two of the Crown Prince, and still more of the bright little drumming child; and, most of all, Graff&#x2019;s of the Man of Sixty) were the only representations of Fredk that did not rather do me ill than good. If a beneficent genius is at work in Berlin upon Fk for England&#x2019;s behoof,&#x2014;I will exclusively and emphatically recommend these three pictures;&#x2014;and for my own behoof (if that by unmerited miracle shd come into play) the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> only. And so, at length, I have <pb id="pg-28-28" n="28:28"/>said my say (impelled really rather by force of <hi rend="italic">conscience</hi> in some perceptible degree); and you can make what use of it you find to be fittest, in any quarter concerned with.</p>
<p>I fear there is nobody about you who can give me any lucid testimony about K&#xF6;nig&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Milit&#xE4;risches Pantheon</hi>, and whether it is worth sending to Berlin for?<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anton Balthasar K&#xF6;nig, <hi rend="italic">Biographisches Lexikon aller Helden und Militairpersonen, welche sich in preussischen Diensten ber&#xfc;hmt gemacht haben</hi>, 2 vols.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Lady Ashburton has been in Town for a couple of days; and has, at last, returned me the Bonn Print Catalogue,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521221-TC-LA-01"><sic>27:369</sic><corr>TC to LA, <date when="1852-12-21">21 Dec. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> with her views upon it. I had marked upon the first fly-leaf, as you will see, what Prints seemed likely for her Ladyship; and she, in a summary manner, after not much discussion, votes for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Prints marked on that leaf, which may still be procurable from Weber,&#x2014;for several of them are probably sold by this time. You will find the Prints also marked with a cross, in the body of the Catalogue; and perhaps some <hi rend="italic">others</hi> are so marked there; but it is to the list on the fly-leaf that you are to look for what alone concerns us: the <hi rend="italic">pages</hi>, I think, are all specified; and you will without difficulty discern what are the Articles selected.</p>
<p>As to the <hi rend="italic">form</hi>, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">&#xE9;tat</hi>&#x201C; (or whatever he calls it, 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) which is to be preferred in each case, I can only leave that to Weber and you with the following general directions:</p>
<p>1&#xB0; That the grand ultimate and sole object in view is that of obtaining the best possible <hi rend="italic">Likeness</hi> of the Individual selected; that, in all cases, therefore, the best attainable <hi rend="italic">Engraving</hi>, and best attainable <hi rend="italic">Copy</hi> (as to paper, preservation &#x26;c) are of essential consequence; and that all dilettante considerations, of &#x201C;rare,&#x201C; &#x201C;curieux,&#x201C; &#x201C;tr&#xE8;s rare&#x201C; &#x26;c are of no consequence whatever.</p>
<p>2&#xB0;. In every case it is considered <hi rend="italic">indispensable</hi> that the Painter or Engraver have actually <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> the Individual he is pretending to represent; <hi rend="italic">copies</hi> from former Painters (as in the case of <hi rend="italic">Erasmus</hi> even by Vandyke)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Desiderius Erasmus (<date when="1466">1466</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1536">1536</date>), Dutch Renaissance humanist, by Sir Anthony Van Dyke (<date when="1599">1599</date>&#x2013;<date when="1641">1641</date>).</note> are not admissible at all. This condition I have kept steadily in view in marking the fly-leaf: but if anywhere M. Weber or you perceive that I have omitted it, let the Print be <hi rend="italic">rejected</hi>. And on the whole, M. Weber is earnestly requested to exercise his own best judgement in choosing always <hi rend="italic">good Likenesses</hi> (for he has probably a learned judgement in such matters), and not to send any which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> does <supplied>[not]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> consider good.</p>
<p>3&#xB0;. There is, of course, no disposition to <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> money in the business; but also I believe I may certify, there will be no stinginess, or grudge of fair cost, for really attaining the object wished;&#x2014;and bad, indifferent, or unsatisfactory Prints, at <hi rend="italic">any</hi> price, will be worse than none; and, in short, must not be sent.</p>
<p>With those guiding considerations, I doubt not we shall get handsomely <pb id="pg-28-30" n="28:30"/>thro&#x2019; the Transaction by and by. You can write to M. Weber at once, inclosing him the List and these directions: let him make what speed he likes; despatch by the first safe conveyance for England; and address,</p>

<p>			<place>Bath House, Piccadilly</place></p>
<p>					<place>London</place>,&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>taking good care to inclose his <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> (with directions how it can be paid here, if such are needful): and that I think is all.</p>
<p>On Sunday night first<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1853-02-06">6 Feb.</date> TC was to be at the Ashburtons&#x2019; where Brookfield saw him and walked with him &#x201C;at 11:30 &#x2026; as far as Knightsbridge&#x201C; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:387).</note> I am not to be here; but am, most other nights, or any day about 3. However, I think you can write to Bonn without further consulting me, on the strength of what you already have.</p>
<p>I am quite involved in impassable quagmires in regard to my Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> affairs; and write, this day, to Abeken,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bernard Rudolf Abeken.</note> for a few Books, in the name of human Charity. For the rest, very sick of nerves, in this harsh east-wind, in these untowardly conjunctures of affairs.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>I could not understand your Letter yesterday morning; being, at any rate, overwhelmed with petty details and hurrying <foreign><hi rend="italic">extranea</hi></foreign> [additional matters], all day, till five o&#x2019;clock struck, so that I got no walking till after dinner. Reading over the Letter again after tea, &#x26; summoning up my remembrances, Jane and I together made it out. Heigho! What to answer now in order to expedite the business, is the question with me before going farther.</p>
<p>I engaged to do thorough-draining for T. Bell and Craigenputtoch,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Bell, see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520110-TC-JAC-01"><sic><sic>26:10</sic><corr>27:10</corr></sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1852-01-10">10 Jan. 1852</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520209-TC-JAC-01"><sic><sic>48</sic><corr>36</corr></sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1852-02-09">9 Feb. 1852</date></corr></ref>, to whom it was let early in <date when="1852">1852</date>.</note> on Jamie&#x2019;s consenting along with him, to the extent of &#xa3;200. Very well: Jamie does not consent to drain;&#x2014;and I, hearing this, remember well my total want of intention to lay out any money at all there except on improvements that were <hi rend="italic">lasting</hi> (dictated in some sort by a kind of landlord-<hi rend="italic">conscience</hi> in my abstruse function there); the half of the original sum, however, since it is expected of me by indubitably friendly judgements, I consent to lay out on <pb id="pg-28-31" n="28:31"/><hi rend="italic">lime</hi>, on the terms proposed; and hope it is thus settled in a satisfying manner. So stood it when I wrote last.</p>
<p>It now appears, however, that I am <hi rend="italic">already</hi> concerned with the draining of &#x201C;two small fields&#x201C; (to what amount I do not know), and that the &#xa3;100 is required over and above that. I had vaguely supposed that it was Bell himself who was draining hitherto, and shewing us the way, or trying whether there was one. We must endeavour first of all, of course, to get honourably out of that, and conclude it.</p>
<p>It appears to me therefore to be a very needful preliminary to ascertain exactly (or as near that as possible) how far we are already engaged for draining,&#x2014;what the &#x201C;two small fields&#x201C; which it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> decided to drain will cost us, will cost <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, that is. We shall then be clear out of that part of the business, and have done with draining. I know not which &#x201C;two fields&#x201C; it is; nor is that of the least consequence, Jamie having agreed for me that it ought to be done, and that there the draining ought to <hi rend="italic">stop</hi>. Whatever this may cost, of course I am bound to pay with due promptitude, nay with thankfulness for any real improvement in that kind: but after that, I, equally of course, have nothing more to do with the &#x201C;&#xa3;200&#x201C; that was promised, or talked of,&#x2014;the purpose for which <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was intended not remaining any longer, but having vanished now from the field of practice or adviseability. I still find it quite inexpedient that I should lay out any money at all on Craigenputtoch except what &#x201C;conscience&#x201C; requires of me,&#x2014;namely for permanent improvements (such as every Landlord, or Rent-eater <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be ready to do), or for engagements entered into with a tenant,&#x2014;which, I think, in the present case, do not exist any farther (certainly not in an express form) than the &#x201C;two small fields&#x201C; in question. I could wish, therefore, as a preliminary to all things, that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> were first of all sorted out to the bottom; and the <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> separated from the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi>,&#x2014; i.e. the voluntary, or partly voluntary, from what is of direct obligation. This once done, we shall see better what is in the <hi rend="italic">lime</hi> or whether anything; but this first.</p>
<p>I am sorry, my dear Brother, you get so much trouble with what is not your burden but mine: however, I cannot help it. If Mr G.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably in error for &#x201C;T.&#x201C;</note> Bell&#x2019;s Correspondence press on you, answer him at once that I must first know what this of permanent draining <hi rend="italic">amounts</hi> to;&#x2014;and that the question of <hi rend="italic">lime</hi>, if not then capable of being settled <hi rend="italic">at once</hi>, must lie over till my next visit to Annandale, when I can <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> of it, for really this of corresponding on the subject falls too heavy on me in my present intricate condition!&#x2014; &#x2014; I am terribly in confusion with my F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> and other enterprises and affairs; in a quite wretched shivery state of nerves, for one thing,&#x2014;the worst of all things! <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear good Mother,&#x2014;</salute>I will write you one of the shortest Notes you ever read, merely to say we are still in the usual way, and nothing wrong with us, in spite of the harsh broken and uncertain weather,&#x2014;which, for your and all our sakes, I often wish to see alter. Patience, the sun will get out at last!&#x2014; Poor Jane still sleeps badly, but <hi rend="italic">better</hi> considerably for the last 3 days; and never gives in. She has been walking with her little Dog <hi rend="italic">Nero;</hi> and I hear her knock at the door this moment,&#x2014;she coming, I not yet got <hi rend="italic">out</hi>. I have been terribly bothered and hurried for the last day or two: and <hi rend="italic">work</hi> is hardly to be got done or tried at all; that is the worst of it!&#x2014; On Tuesday Afternoon<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Sat.</note> and night we had our <hi rend="italic">Fog;</hi> a right &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">London</hi> Fog,&#x201C; the first this season; and fairly the <hi rend="italic">blackest</hi> I ever saw. Jane and I had to go up to the Ashburtons&#x2019; (who were incidentally here) that night&#x2014; 2&#xBD; miles off us:&#x2014;the omnibuses and every vehicle had ceased; no team could go except at a snail&#x2019;s pace, and with blazing torches at the head of it, &#x201C;Hoh-ho-ing&#x201C; as it went on; you could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> see one street-lamp from another. I proposed to Jane, after half a mile of it, that we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> turn home, and give up the affair; but she would not: &#x201C;she had never <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> a London Fog out of doors, and would be amused by the spectacle!&#x201C; We accordingly did make it out, without accident or mistake (by dint of excellent pilotage!); had a pleasant enough evening, and a quiet slow and safe journey home,&#x2014;the air blacker than ever; various persons asking us, &#x201C;Have the goodness to tell me <hi rend="italic">where I am!</hi>&#x201C; My new shirt was quite <hi rend="italic">black</hi> in the inside of the collar when I took it up next morning.&#x2014; There is no sort of &#x201C;danger&#x201C; whatsoever, for a foot passenger, on such occasions: the police are everywhere, with blazing <hi rend="italic">lamps</hi> on their breasts, with skilful polite direction to every one that asks it; and all the people maintain the most exemplary good humour, everybody indeed seeming to be partly amused by the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> state of the world and its atmosphere. This &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">London</hi> Fog&#x201C; is simply a common heavy <hi rend="italic">mist</hi>, with the <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi> of 2&#xBD; million people&#x2019;s fires superadded, which of course makes it black enough if there be no <hi rend="italic">wind</hi> and a half-<hi rend="italic">frost</hi> in the air. In one of the streets, that night, the police had opened a gas-pipe, and screwed an upright tube into it (for the public benefit), out of which there rose a blazing jet of flame, as <hi rend="italic">long</hi> as a cow&#x2019;s tail and as <hi rend="italic">thick</hi> as a horse&#x2019;s: well, at the distance of perhaps 50 yards you could not <hi rend="italic">see</hi> that at all!&#x2014; Next morning, about breakfast time, it rolled all off, and we had visible skies and clear weather again.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Alas, alas, I have occupied all my time with it; and should have been talking either of <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, or of something that interested you more!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-33" n="28:33"/>I am still deep in German Books and sunk sorrowfully in masses of abstruse inquiries: but nothing comes of it yet in the shape of water to my own mill; nothing, or far too little, <hi rend="italic">frightfully</hi> little. However, we must be patient; and <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> &#x201C;better things.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Jack and I have not yet quite settled the Craigenputtoch matter,&#x2014;are only settling it. He reported to me Jamie&#x2019;s verdict; for which I am much obliged, and which I will keep faithfully in my eye.</p>
<p>Jean, it appears is coming to see you; I expect a long narrative from her about my poor Mother&#x2019;s affairs, and how she is at all in this winter imprisonment.&#x2014; Jean seems to be apprehensive about meeting &#x201C;Phoebe&#x201C;; but you can assure her there is no <hi rend="italic">danger</hi> whatever in that quarter.&#x2014; &#x2014; The Note from Jamie, to the Dr, I got some days ago: Isabella may like to read it; the young man is <hi rend="italic">improving</hi> in his hand.</p>
<p><closer><salute>May blessings be upon you all, dear Mother: that is my heart&#x2019;s prayer now as ever. Your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>You never came to see me again; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was not well done altogether; but I am not writing of that at present. The time approaches when you will return, and then probably we may do better.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After election to Parliament in <date when="1852">1852</date>, Duffy says he used to visit TC and &#x201C;generally had a walk&#x201C; with him on Sunday afternoons. Otherwise, &#x201C;he had chairs brought to the grass plot behind his house, and tranquilly smoked a long clay pipe, with a friend or two sitting or standing beside him. &#x2026; Later, when the Derby Government fell, we spoke of the event. I said, though I had voted against them, I could not help having a certain sympathy with Disraeli for the indomitable pluck with which he faced his enemies at the head of a party which distrusted him only a little less than the honourable gentlemen opposite.&#x201C; TC then launched into a diatribe against Disraeli and the Jews. &#x201C;He asked my opinion from time to time of the notable men in the Parliament of <date when="1852">1852</date>, and uttered trenchant comments on them, but he knew little or nothing personally of the men in question, and on reading the notes I find them hardly worth publishing&#x201C; (Duffy 179&#x2013;180, 190).</note></p>
<p>I remember hearing you speak, when here, about shelves for your Books in your Pimlico Lodging&#x2014; Now it strikes me I have, lying in this garret, and of no use to anybody but the moths, a portion of my own old Book-case, complete all but the nails; a couple of <hi rend="italic">standard</hi> sides, namely, and perhaps 6 or 7 <pb id="pg-28-34" n="28:34"/>shelves of 4 or 5 feet long; a thing which any carpenter with sixpence worth of nails, can knock together for you in an hour or two; which might hold 150 or 200 volumes;&#x2014;and which it would be a small but real comfort for me to know doing service for some friendly Christian in this manner! Pray think of it, if you still want such a thing; and pray determine to have it. It is lying here, safe tho&#x2019; dusty in the garret, tied together with ropes; and can be brought to you in a barrow; and will be proud to assist in your Parliamentary career; and when that is ended, or changed, will cheerfully serve as firewood, &#x26; make itself generally useful! The<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> <hi rend="italic">another</hi> couple of &#x201C;standards&#x201C; here; but, before I saved them for such a purpose, the headlong joiner had cut up the shelves of these.&#x2014; So stands it; and will stand for you. In the name of the Prophet!</p>
<p>Some one of your Clerks is falling asleep at his post, I think. The <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, which did not fail once in seven weeks to reach London on Saturday night, now (this good while) does not, above once in 7 weeks, come till Monday morning,&#x2014;often not till Monday at 11 o&#x2019;clock (which <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> mistake I know is not yours);&#x2014;whereby, of course, my use of it, and much more important uses it has to serve in London, is much obstructed. A thing that should be remedied if it easily can.</p>
<p>One &#x201C;Thomas Mulock, Dublin,&#x201C; sends me an acrid little Pamphlet, the other morning, solemnly denouncing and damning to the Pit, really in a rather sincere and devout manner, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">both</hi> the Irish Churches&#x201C; (Protestant and Catholic), in the name of Jesus, and of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> instalment of Salvation to Ireland, of which native country he is a passionate lover.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Samuel Mulock (<date when="1789">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869">1869</date>), <hi rend="italic">The Letters on the Queen&#x2019;s Visit, Reprinted from the Freeman&#x2019;s Journal; to which are Prefixed some Considerations on the Present State of Ireland</hi> (Dublin, <date when="1853">1853</date>); prolific pamphleteer on religious and educational questions; Baptist minister, Stoke on Trent, <date when="1822">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831">31</date>; father of Dinah Mulock, see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491113-JWC-JF-01"><sic>24:288&#x2013;89</sic><corr>JWC to JF, <date when="1849-11-13">13 Nov. 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note> I fear the poor man is maddish. But I have thought a thousand times, since seeing Ireland, to much the same effect, in the &#x201C;name&#x201C; of still higher entities and considerations,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; virtuously holding my peace on the subject. The &#x201C;Churches,&#x201C; alas, alas! Of all preachers and prophets and divine men wanted in Ireland (and in England, and Scotland, and all the other wretched lands, where Hypocritical Palaver reigns and rules and makes the world fetid and accursed) is the &#x201C;Divine Drill-Serjeant&#x201C; (as I often say), who, with steel whips, or by whatever method, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> teach poor canting slaves to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> a little of the things they eloquently say (and even <hi rend="italic">know</hi>) everywhere, and leave <hi rend="italic">undone</hi>. Poor Mulock! Really, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> there any such <hi rend="italic">totally</hi> accursed <hi rend="italic">sin</hi> as that (with no redeeming side at all);&#x2014;or even such general, nay universal one, in this illustrious thrice-hopeful epoch of Free-Press, Emancipation, Toleration, Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin, and the rest of it?&#x2014;</p>
<p><closer><salute><pb id="pg-28-35" n="28:35"/><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Duffy: you need not write about that sublime question of deal shelves; only send for them if fit to be accepted&#x2014;&#x2014; I have been all this winter, if not idle, terribly obstructed, terribly unsuccessful in regard to getting any work done! That really is the one thing &#x201C;terrible&#x201C; in this universe.&#x2014;&#x2014; Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>You have seized the rationale of the Prints quite aright; and have only to proceed as you intend, to bring the matter to a happy issue.</p>
<p>I have rashly marked, as you requested, the &#x201C;8 Clarendons&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prints of portraits presumably in an edn. of the <hi rend="italic">History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars</hi> by Edward Hyde, 1st earl of Clarendon.</note> and another (9 in all) with <hi rend="italic">ink;</hi> but, alas, the paper doesn&#x2019;t stand ink, and the <hi rend="italic">crosses</hi> come thro&#x2019; in a most perplexing manner! I have therefore marked them again in pencil (<figure><graphic url="volume-28-35-01.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure>): in fact, all the Prints there named are to be got, except only <hi rend="italic">Carolus Rex</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mrs</hi> Vandyck (N<hi rend="italic">os</hi> 374, 373);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably King Charles I (<date when="1600">1600</date>&#x2013;<date when="1649">1649</date>) or Charles II (<date when="1630">1630</date>&#x2013;<date when="1685">85</date>) and Mary Van Dyke, b. Ruthven (d. <date when="1645">1645</date>), m. <date when="1639">1639</date>, Sir Anthony Van Dyke.</note> and you will have no farther difficulty with that.&#x2014; If you will now, at your leisure, give me a <hi rend="italic">Copy</hi> of the List you send to Bonn,&#x2014;marking merely the <hi rend="italic">Numbers</hi> of the several Prints (not minding their <hi rend="italic">prices</hi> &#x26;c), and merely requesting Weber to inclose another Copy of his <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi> along with the Prints which come,&#x2014;I will forward said Copy-<hi rend="italic">List</hi> to her Ladyship, and so I think we shall be fairly out of the adventure. With thanks to Heaven and you!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was reflecting, on Saturday morning, how extremely useful a hardy intelligent assistant might be to me <hi rend="italic">at the Museum</hi> in my present enterprises: a great many Books, Prints &#x26;c on my Prussian affairs lie scattered there, especially in George III&#x2019;s Library (where an <hi rend="italic">intelligent</hi> soul has been at work in former days,&#x2014;Heaven bless him!),&#x2014;but to get them dug out, and even made ready for my own reading, in that sad Establishment, is in general beyond what strength of heart and skin I have.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George III&#x2019;s great collection, part of the King&#x2019;s Library, British Museum, bought in <date when="1823">1823</date>.</note> An obliging but not very articulate gentleman, called Watts, is always ready to help, indeed;&#x2014;who possesses the <hi rend="italic">names</hi> of more Books than anybody I have ever seen, but beyond their names, possesses&#x2014;&#x2014;!&#x2014; In fact, I am very ill off; as every man, indeed, in this <pb id="pg-28-36" n="28:36"/>world is, who is following a work of <hi rend="italic">his own</hi> in it,&#x2014;and leaping ditches and hedges with his loaded cart, instead of following the beaten Dilettante highways, the goal of <hi rend="italic">which</hi> is unhappily not so delightful as the smooth travelling on them!</p>
<p>Various <hi rend="italic">points</hi> in the black abominable Chaos of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Reichs-Geschichte</hi></foreign> [traditional German history] have attracted me: incidents concerning which I could desire to question the first <hi rend="italic">eyewitnesses</hi> (if such exist): such even exist in Voigts scandalous Dungheap (in 9 heavy volumes, the <hi rend="italic">pearls</hi> of which could be held in a snuffbox):<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johannes Voight, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte Preussens</hi>, 9 vols. (K&#xF6;nigsberg, <date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839">39</date>), &#x201C;often cited here: Nine heavy volumes, grounded on faithful reading, but with a fatal defect of almost every other quality&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 12:102n).</note> above all, I am eminently desirous to know something <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> concerning the First Brandenburg Hohenzollern, and his <hi rend="italic">Lange Gretchen</hi> there; concerning whom, or which, my poor <hi rend="italic">Michaelis</hi> (a learned man given to &#x201C;brandy,&#x201C; I am told) carefully avoids <hi rend="italic">saying</hi> anything at all, but merely rocks and rattles immense baskets of &#x201C;marine-stores&#x201C; in my bewildered ear.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prince Friedrich VI of the Franconian house of Hohenzollern became, <date when="1417">1417</date>, elector and margrave of Brandenberg, founder of the royal Prussian line; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:162&#x2013;67. <hi rend="italic">Lange Gretchen</hi>, a &#x201C;huge gun, the biggest ever seen, &#x2018;a twenty-four pounder&#x2019; no less; to which the peasants, dragging her with difficulty through the clayey roads, gave the name of <hi rend="italic">Faule Grete</hi> (Lazy, or Heavy Peg). &#x2026; I have often inquired after Lazy Peg&#x2019;s fate in subsequent times; but could never learn anything distinct:&#x2014;the German Dryasdust is a dull dog, and seldom carries anything human in those big wallets of his!&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:164). August Benedict Michaelis, <hi rend="italic">Einleitung zu einer volst&#xE4;ndigen Geschichte der chur- und f&#xfc;rstlichen H&#xE4;user in Teutschland</hi>, 3 pts. (Lemgo, <date when="1759">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1785">85</date>). In his copy in HCC, inscribed &#x201C;T. Carlyle, <date when="1853">1853</date>,&#x201C; TC noted: &#x201C;This A. Benedict M<hi rend="italic">s</hi> went from Halle as Ext<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Prof<hi rend="italic">r</hi> of Philosophy to G&#xF6;ttingen (<date when="1753">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1756">56</date>); thence to Altona, where he died, <date when="1768">1768</date>, age 43. This is his principal work&#x2014;worth little.&#x201C; He then added: &#x201C;This A<hi rend="italic">st</hi> B<hi rend="italic">ct</hi> Michaelis, it farther appears, was known in G&#xF6;ttingen as a lover of <hi rend="italic">brandy</hi>,&#x2014;alas! (B&#xfc;sching&#x2019;s Autobiography, 6th vol. of <hi rend="italic">Beytr&#xE4;ge</hi>).&#x201C;</note> On this Earth, I believe, there is nowhere so intense a blockhead, so fatal to himself and mankind, as your learned college one who never dreams but he is a prophet and shining light!</p>
<p>No doubt some stout man, with a clear head and loyal patient heart, <hi rend="italic">might</hi> perhaps achieve something for me in regard to all this, and perhaps I really shall search a little more for such a one by and by: but it is not a work I could set anybody upon at all, except for weekly wages, and to save him from worse,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">you</hi> not by any means! And if I even find nobody,&#x2014;who knows? One&#x2019;s coat <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be cut &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">according</hi> to the cloth, &#x201C;&#x2014;or one&#x2019;s no coat;&#x2014;and perhaps a small coat (I have known it so) is <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than a big. I leave it peaceably to the Powers.&#x2014; In the way of <hi rend="italic">Copying</hi> there is little or even nothing hitherto, to occupy your evenings. A friendly Mr Chorley went thro&#x2019; all the embroiled scrawls I had, some two years ago, in the way you did with the <hi rend="italic">Lr <pb id="pg-28-37" n="28:37"/>Day Pamphlet</hi> unteased wool;&#x2014;and made what he called a &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Zur Geschichte</hi></foreign> [Toward a History] of James I&#x201C; (very small &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Zur</hi></foreign>&#x201C; indeed):<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Printed in <hi rend="italic">Historical Sketches</hi>, ed.

TC referred to these papers in his will (<date when="1873">1873</date>) as &#x201C;a set of fragments about James I, which were loyally fished out for me from much other Cromwellian rubbish, and doubtless carefully copied more than twenty years ago by the late John Chorley who was always so good to me.&#x201C; After copying the MS, Chorley wrote to TC, <date when="1851-03-21">21 March 1851</date>: &#x201C;I believe that I have sifted out all that is sufficiently written-out to take its place at once in a series of chapters. &#x2026; As it is, the collection is fit, I venture to say, with <hi rend="italic">very</hi> little care from your hand &#x2026; to make a most inviting little volume. &#x2026; That you will not allow so much of what is good, the fruit of so much labour, to moulder in a box, I most earnestly beg.&#x201C; TC did not think so. He wrapped up the MS and the transcript and put them away labeled &#x201C;About James I. and Charles I.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Never scruple to send to me for a Book, when you are hard up for something to read: I can almost always (as in this recent case too, it was) find <hi rend="italic">without</hi> inconvenience one or the other mass of printed stuff to send you, which will be better than nothing. Remember also, when you are at Scotsbrig, to <hi rend="italic">settle</hi> about the course of the regular Magazine and Review which leave <hi rend="italic">this place</hi> by nature, in whatever direction; and do not forget to tell me <hi rend="italic">if</hi> you decide that I am to make any alteration.</p>
<p>But what I want most with you in reference to Scotsbrig, and the cause of my writing today, is this: That, since my Mother is so well provided with <hi rend="italic">wine</hi> (tho&#x2019; I wish you would look into this too, and satisfy <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>, whether the wine benefits, and whether she has enough of it),&#x2014;you would get, for my own sake, and take down with you, for our dear old Mother, Half-a-dozen bottles of the best old <hi rend="italic">brandy</hi> (brown or pale,&#x2014;perhaps brown <hi rend="italic">best</hi>, if truly good?); pray try to assure yourself that it is good: then send me the account,&#x2014;I can pay you in a minute even to farthings. Do this for me; and be sure you do it well! That is all I have to say today.</p>

<p>We have horribly cold weather too; dry, but bitter to a degree: and the <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> talent of this family (except it be Nero&#x2019;s and the maid&#x2019;s) is not considerable. This morning I was awake far too early; didn&#x2019;t bathe, on account of the fierce cold, and am now going to do it (tho&#x2019; already shivering), now when I have room to walk myself into heat again.&#x2014; &#x2014; Here, to crown the whole, is an unfortunate Lombard (brown youth from the Southern side of the Alps) come with his <hi rend="italic">organ</hi> to grind out a living for himself just under my window: and the question arises, Whether to go out and, if not assassinate him, call the Police upon him, or to take myself away to the bath-tub and the other side of the house? Of course, I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to chuse the latter alternative,&#x2014;and do, for the wretch&#x2019;s organ is a <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> one, I hear; drawn by a horse; and, one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think, played by one!</p>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">Sir</hi>,</salute>
<p>The bearer of this is M. Mont&#xE9;gut, of the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi>, whom I have seen twice, and several of whose pieces I have read,&#x2014;decidedly with a favourable impression towards him. He has a clear and delicate intelligence, a fine talent of expression and composition, and appears to be every way an amiable and accomplished young man.</p>
<p>Being on a visit to this country, with time on his hands, it has struck him he might perhaps write something acceptable for <hi rend="italic">Fraser;</hi> and he requests me to introduce him to you for a consultation on that object. He has clearly a good talent for writing to his own countrymen on English subjects; perhaps, under your advice, and with a good translator, he might succeed in writing something to the English on French subjects, upon which of course he is full of knowledge new to us here. If he had a judicious translator to consult with, it would clearly be a great help. At all events, I think a few minutes of your time will not be ill spent on such an offer, from such a man; and to him your words <pb id="pg-28-39" n="28:39"/>cannot but throw light on the project he has. Pray let him be welcome to you on those terms.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I was disappointed on Saturday; but will not be today;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC usually wrote his mother on Sat.; <date when="1853-02-13">13 Feb.</date> is Sun.</note> so I take time by the forelock,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> and write you a little word <hi rend="italic">before</hi> &#x201C;going farther.&#x201C;</p>
<p>We had a very hasty but most welcome little despatch from the Dr about you, the night before last; which gave us great satisfaction so far. He found you &#x201C;not worse,&#x201C; he says: alas, that is not much; but we must be thankful too for that! Dear Mother, this is really hard weather; and I think you are perhaps <hi rend="italic">better</hi> to &#x201C;keep in bed,&#x201C; while it is so cold elsewhere. I hope you have something tolerable to read while there? I hope too the weather will <hi rend="italic">soften</hi> before long; this harsh atmosphere is good for none of us: but indeed the sun is daily getting higher; and bright spring weather, according to the very Almanack, is on the road!</p>
<p>We have had <hi rend="italic">snow</hi> here, which is very rare in this climate: snow with sleet, in broken dashes; a thin coat of white is still visible in all gardens and Parks; and last night (as was evident even in bed) we had a brisk crisp <hi rend="italic">frost</hi>,&#x2014;the first we have seen this year. I cannot say I like the <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> weather nearly so well as I once did: it cracks my very hands (in spite of gloves), and is very uncomfortable for a <hi rend="italic">morning bath</hi>, among other things! I do bathe daily however; and find that, any my<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> two tumblers daily of cold water, do really well in regard to the <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> region: I take no other kind of medicine at all; and am visibly rather better at present than I often am.&#x2014; I keep struggling away among my Books; irksome enough drudgery of various poor sorts; but I hope I am scraping soil together to &#x201C;big the dyke with,&#x201C; one day!&#x2014; Jane also seems a little better in the <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> department, and otherwise does not complain. She has been in much anxiety this day or two about Mazzini and his mad &#x201C;insurrection at Milan&#x201C; (concerning which I sent you a Newspaper the other day): a very mad &#x201C;insurrection&#x201C;; but a &#x201C;man&#x201C; really of much worth in spite of all that,&#x2014;and who probably could not <pb id="pg-28-40" n="28:40"/>well <hi rend="italic">help</hi> its taking place, as matters stood. If the Austrians could catch him, they would willingly give a big &#x201C;town of land&#x201C; for the prize, and shoot him down like a mad dog: but they cannot quite; and that too is a kind of comfort. We learn this morning that the &#x201C;Insurrection&#x201C; is quite suppressed and gone to pot; but that Mazzini himself is &#x201C;in safety.&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The uprising in Milan, <date when="1853-02-06">6 Feb.</date>, was quickly put down by the Austrians who had foreseen it. Mazzini wrote, <date when="1853-02-07">7 Feb.:</date> &#x201C;Yesterday, between four and five in the afternoon, the first movement began; it was quenched in the evening; the gates of Milan were and are now shut.&#x201C; He had been in Lugano, &#x201C;shut in a room, watched, looked for; and with difficult communications even with the town,&#x201C; but left for Zurich, <date when="1853-02-13">13 Feb.</date>, &#x201C;starting by night and going through cold and snow&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Scritti</hi> 48: 243&#x2013;44, 259, 264).</note> Let him continue so!</p>
<p>The other day I took a long walk into the Country to look after a poor Scotchman called Maccall, who is in very bad case just now. A man of much faculty; bred originally for preaching, and who <hi rend="italic">has</hi> had congregations, twice, in England, but could not get on with them (owing to his own honesty, ardour &#x26;c but also to his own <hi rend="italic">pride</hi>, I think); whereupon some 7 or 8 years ago he gave up preaching altogether, and has been in London, with Wife and one child, trying to &#x201C;live by his pen.&#x201C; At last he is broken down in health,&#x2014;frightful shattering of the nerves,&#x2014;and one knows not what to do with him! I found him, that day, gone into the country (to some friends), and not there; his wife, a fine cleanly hardy Lancashire little woman, pleased me much with her air of quiet steady courage:&#x2014;and I left the poor cottage with many sorrowful &#x26; yet respectful reflexions in my mind. Jane <hi rend="italic">begs</hi>, from some of her rich friends, for poor M. He is a good man too, and high, tho&#x2019; too <hi rend="italic">lean</hi>,&#x2014;and harsh-edged, as a rusty <foreign><hi rend="italic">lipped</hi></foreign> razor!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Our Scotsbrig butter, excellent to the last, is <hi rend="italic">done;</hi>&#x2014;to the regret of the public,&#x2014;six weeks before its time! We could have done with 20 pounds more, had we known it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> keep so well.&#x2014; &#x2014;<closer><salute>Enough now, dear Mother: for I have many things still to do. Give my regards to Isabella, to Jamie: my best blessings be with you all. Ever y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi></salute></closer></p>

<p>Will you be so good as make out the above List in proper form for your German correspondent; and endeavour to procure me the Books <hi rend="italic">with all the <pb id="pg-28-43" n="28:43"/>speed possible. Some</hi> of the Books, you seemed to say, and an authentic <hi rend="italic">Yes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">No</hi> about the others, would be procurable in <hi rend="italic">three weeks</hi>. To wait for months, and then get the Book <hi rend="italic">after</hi> you are past needing it, is very intolerable!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Another List, compiled from your three Catalogues, will possibly be sent you from the London Library: but those are not so pressingly <hi rend="italic">in haste</hi> as mine.</p>
<p>Can you return me this Paper when your man has copied it. I have marked the Catalogue prices, in a rude way, in English money: for my own use that, of course.</p>

<p>The British Quarterly is certainly out, and an Article on one <hi rend="italic">Giusti</hi> is in it;&#x2014;in the London Library, where it has to lie for 3 months for personal inspection by the curious, I have seen it lying.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >[Henry Lushington,] &#x201C;Giuseppe Giusti&#x2014;His Life and Poetry,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">British Quarterly Review</hi> <date when="1853-02-17">17 (Feb. 1853)</date>: 54&#x2013;95.

For stupid I fear it is like to be: the Editor, called &#x201C;Dr Vaughan,&#x201C; is L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Carlisle&#x2019;s favourite Dissenting Preacher; was once a Playactor (and is so essentially still, under other conditions and in much fataller form), a windy <pb id="pg-28-44" n="28:44"/>unsound blockhead,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I suppose, he sometimes stumbles on a man of talent to write for him, too.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Vaughan (<date when="1795">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868">1868</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28142"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Congregational minister, ed. of <hi rend="italic">British Quarterly Review</hi> <date when="1845">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865">65</date>.

<salute>Dearest Kate</salute>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Hawks had a very little note from <hi rend="italic">him</hi> this morning. from which I <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> the whole miserable business. In <hi rend="italic">forty eight hours</hi> more, the Insurrection was to have broken out in a great many towns at once.

The central office pbd. it, inserting the date, <date when="1853-02">Feb. 1853</date>, and omitting two paragraphs showing that the document was of an earlier date (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi> <date when="1853-02-10">10 Feb.</date>). The National Party also issued a manifesto signed by Saffi and Mazzini (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi> <date when="1853-02-12">12 Feb.</date>). When the insurrection failed Mazzini tried to stop publication in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> but was too late; Kossuth disowned the publication, claiming it was Mazzini&#x2019;s invention. Mazzini wrote, <date when="1853-02-20">20 Feb.</date>, to the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> that he had the original in Kossuth&#x2019;s hand, &#x201C;sent to me by Kossuth, on my own request, &#x2026; for the express purpose of being published in the case of an insurrectionary movement in Italy.

<salute>Dear Sir</salute>
<p><hi rend="italic">Todd&#x2019;s Life of Milton</hi>, so far as I know, is the last and completest; a volume easy to be had in the Old Book Shops: <hi rend="italic">Symmons&#x2019;s</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> is 40 or 50 years old, perhaps worth getting too, tho&#x2019; more declamatory, and <hi rend="italic">wants</hi> the curious <pb id="pg-28-46" n="28:46"/>Document (only to be found in <hi rend="italic">Todd</hi>) about Milton&#x2019;s Will.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His oral will, mainly in favor of his third wife. It was declared invalid.</note> I have also read an old Life by Toland (160 Years old or so), but do not recollect that I learned anything from it. The most <hi rend="italic">curious</hi> of all the Lives is that by the Richardsons (Painters, father &#x26; son), who give us M&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">living</hi> physiognomy, and have heaped together in a confused way a variety of notable particulars.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Todd&#x2019;s life is in vol. 1 of <hi rend="italic">The Poetical Works of John Milton</hi>, 6 vols. (<date when="1801">1801</date>). Charles Symmons&#x2019;s life is in vol. 7 of Milton&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Prose Works</hi>, 7 vols. (<date when="1806">1806</date>). John Toland&#x2019;s life is prefixed to his edn. of Milton&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Prose Works</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1698">1698</date>). The life by Jonathan Richardson and his son Jonathan is in <hi rend="italic">Explanatory Notes and Remarks on &#x201C;Paradise Lost&#x201C;</hi> (<date when="1734">1734</date>), with a portrait of Milton etched by the father; not in Bibl. Nationale.</note> It is probably M. Guizot will find this Book in the <hi rend="italic">Biblioth&#xE8;que Royale;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Now the Biblioth&#xE8;que Nationale in Paris. Guizot, in retirement in Normandy, was working on <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la r&#xE9;volution d&#x2019;Angleterre</hi>. Vols. 1 and 2, to Charles I&#x2019;s execution, had been pbd. <date when="1826">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827">27</date>; repbd. in 5th edn. with the final 4 vols., which covered the Republic, the Protectorates, and the restoration of Charles II (Paris, <date when="1854">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856">56</date>). &#x201C;Probably&#x201C; thus in MS.</note> otherwise it will be worth searching out for him.</p>
<p>These are all the Lives of Milton I know. Perhaps there is one other by <hi rend="italic">Hayley;</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hayley&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Milton</hi> was originally prefixed to Boydell &#x26; Nichol&#x2019;s edn. of Milton&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (<date when="1794">1794</date>) and then enlarged and separately pbd., <date when="1796">1796</date>.</note> which I do not remember to have read? If there be, it is pretty sure to be a very flimsy performance.&#x2014; Indeed it ought to be said, all these Lives of Milton, considered as <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi>, are of a very low quality indeed: but, except <hi rend="italic">Toland</hi> &#x26; <hi rend="italic">Hayley</hi>, they ought to be looked into,&#x2014;especially <hi rend="italic">Richardson</hi>.</p>
<p>As M. Guizot has got my Book on <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, he will find, in the Notes or Text, indication of nearly all the Books on his subject which I found of any value to me;&#x2014;and on any especial point of inquiry, my light (if I have any) is at your service &#x26; his.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Here has a Letter come, which I find lying as I come down stairs (already too late) for my modicum of walk amid the snow. I despatch it without delay.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-47" n="28:47"/>I was much obliged by your little bulletin about our Mother. This hard weather is not good for her,&#x2014;nor, I doubt, for your Phoebe either. I wrote to my Mother on Monday; and hope to hear again about her, from you, one of these days. The shortest word, you are aware, is better than none.</p>
<p>We have our winter here, like others, now at last. Gentle snows or ungentle, almost every day there is snow; yet it never comes to anything; and the Parks and gardens hardly maintain a light ragged coat of white. We get sleet too, according to the varieties of wind; and have always frost in the mornings, crisp under foot,&#x2014;generally with an hour or two of sunshine about the noon &#x201C;tide,&#x201C; followed by <hi rend="italic">blanketted</hi> skies a while after. The worst for me is, the vile effect for the <hi rend="italic">hands</hi> of the bather in the morning, which absolutely <hi rend="italic">freeze</hi> in handling the cold buttons, one by one, after the plunge is over. A run however, and then a royal cup of coffee, sets all to rights. We are both of us ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> as well as usual,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; Jane hovers on the edge of a little cold today.</p>
<p>Poor Forster has fallen into his <hi rend="italic">rheumatic fever</hi> again; these relapses are not of good augury for him; Darwin too is a prisoner.&#x2014; We work, and are very solitary here. Mazzini&#x2019;s &#x201C;insurrection&#x201C; pass<supplied>[es]</supplied> the bounds of the comico-tragic: too bad after all;&#x2014;and ought to <hi rend="italic">end</hi> that species of operations. He himself is about the <hi rend="italic">Ticino</hi> region,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Lugano, Switzerland, nr. the Italian border.</note> and not out of danger.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Sister,&#x2014;</salute>Here <supplied>[is a]</supplied> Packet of Canada Letters wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I received last night from Jack, dating &#x201C;Scotsbrig,&#x201C; with the commission to forward them to you by next post; as I now do. They are all struggling along in Canada, as you will, much in the old fashion: Jack reports farther that our Mother, who continued still in bed, was not worse than he had seen her last week, but &#x201C;decidedly better,&#x201C;&#x2014;tho&#x2019;, alas, we cannot think that &#x201C;better&#x201C; means a very comfortable state, in her state in the present weather! For the rest, he writes with inexpressible haste, and gives no particulars. I wait for a more lucid description when you pay your visit:&#x2014;don&#x2019;t forget the little commission you undertook.</p>
<p>We have rather severe weather here really; a distinct thin coating of <supplied>[snow and sleet]</supplied> fallen in various forms, and at various <supplied>[local]</supplied>ities, for the last ten days: a good har<supplied>[d frost]</supplied> now at length come upon the scene, end<supplied>[ing that]</supplied> grey sleety concern; and we have, for two or t<supplied>[hree]</supplied> hours daily, a bright sun, with keen north-wind, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> brings mankind to their overcoats and shawls, and <pb id="pg-28-48" n="28:48"/>is really not to be despised as weather,&#x2014;especially if you can walk fast. Poor Jane has taken a little cold; but I think is better again, and gone out today.</p>
<p>I have seen nothing more of Brown,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Brown.</note> nor heard anything that was distinct: I mean to make another pilgrimage that way, one of these days; and expect to find him much as he was; and will advise a Letter to Aird for one thing. Poor Aird; it is really very dreary the picture you give of him in his solitude, in his blue cloak over the fire!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You once sent me a pair of excell<hi rend="italic">t <foreign>whaings</foreign></hi> (<hi rend="italic">thongs</hi>, leather shoe ties, not too <hi rend="italic">thick</hi>) from Dumfries: if you like now to do that feat again I think it will be welcome just about this time!

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>On Saturday night late, the Parcels Company brought me a little soft Packet, containing certain printed unfolded sheets, and the Note here inclosed. The sheets, on being folded, turn out to be the worthy Dahlmann&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Works on German History;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann, <hi rend="italic">Quellenkunde der deutschen Geschichte</hi> (G&#xF6;ttingen, <date when="1830">1830</date>; 2nd edn., <date when="1838">1838</date>).</note> evidently not a bad work of its kind, tho&#x2019; on my particular department it does not seem to go very deep, or take the matter up very tightly. I will have it bound, and keep it, as of value intrinsic and extrinsic. It is due, I perceive, to the kindness of your friend Abel;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heinrich Friedrich Otto Abel (<date when="1824">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854">54</date>), historian and lecturer at Bonn Univ.</note> whom, please, thank on my behalf.&#x2014; If Dahlmann had told more distinctly his experience of the <hi rend="italic">worth</hi>, and in many case of the total want of worth, of the Books he mentions, his Catalogue w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been much usefuller.</p>
<p>There is something very sad to me in these Professorial <foreign><hi rend="italic">Bearbeitungen</hi></foreign> [treatments] of German History old and new, as the tone and manner of them (for they are mostly all in one tone and manner) gets familiar to me. So academical, learned, and yet so totally <hi rend="italic">in</hi>-human, void of any interest but a pedantic one. Why thresh the straw anew in every new generation? There is nothing to be had of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> but dust and hard work!&#x2014; &#x2014; I regret exceedingly these people cannot be got to compose luculent Indexes of all sorts (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> they c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You will take a small Note rather than none at all,&#x2014;merely to tell you that we are pretty well here, still struggling along in the old way; and as to &#x201C;news,&#x201C; have properly speaking <hi rend="italic">none</hi>, which indeed may be considered good news.</p>
<p>Jane&#x2019;s cold is gone; it never came to any amount that was considerable; only kept her in the house for a day or two; but now, I see, she ventures out altogether as before. Today, too, we have got <hi rend="italic">thaw</hi> at last; which will be very welcome to us,&#x2014;and truly I hope for my good old Mother&#x2019;s sake, there is the like at Scotsbrig too;&#x2014;for the hard grim temperature has not been good for any of us. We had hard <hi rend="italic">black</hi> frost for about a week past; no snow <hi rend="italic">falling</hi>, but some thin coat <hi rend="italic">lying</hi> on the unfrequented spots; and all the young world <hi rend="italic">skating</hi>, the ice thick enough to have carried <hi rend="italic">carts</hi>. Most days the sun got out for an hour or two; and made here and there a little <hi rend="italic">mud</hi>, which froze again at night. But now today I felt before getting out of bed that the wind must be changing: accordingly, in my short morning-walk (or rather <hi rend="italic">run</hi>, for I am usually rather cold, from my bath, and <hi rend="italic">run</hi>, when I can, to gather heat before breakfast), snow came upon me, which soon grew <hi rend="italic">sleet</hi>, grew rain; and to my great satisfaction it is falling on my <hi rend="italic">windows</hi> here wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> testify that it is from the West! If it will continue?&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack sent me a short Note from Scotsbrig about his visit there; and much was I obliged to him for that good service. He represented you as tolerably even wonderfully well, considering the weather there was. I fancied he had come upon you in some good hour; and I was glad, too, that I had got share of it thro&#x2019; his report. You keep almost close to bed, he says; which probably is wisest till the temperature change. I hope you have reading enough? With <pb id="pg-28-50" n="28:50"/>something to <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, you can still entertain yourself well; which is very fortunate, and, I must say, rather <hi rend="italic">creditable</hi> too.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jean is coming over directly I believe. From a Note I had last night, it appears you are to look for her from Moffat in a very short time,&#x2014;or perhaps she may have already come when this Note arrives. Remind her that she was to write to me.</p>
<p>The Parliament has begun here; but that properly no difference to me, as I do not at present take the least interest in what they are doing, or see almost any of them,&#x2014;or indeed see any one that I can help seeing! I stick close to my wretched old Books, with many an abstruse thought in my head, about them, and myself, and things and persons in general;&#x2014;and hope always I shall be able to <hi rend="italic">distil</hi> something out of all this, one day; who knows? At any rate, it is better not to be bothered with people who have nothing <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> to tell one, and who would hinder one&#x2019;s affairs rather than further them.&#x2014;&#x2014; The other night, however, we had the &#x201C;Sir Ja<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Stephen&#x201C; again; who was very airy and involved; more so than usual, I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, and attributed it to a <hi rend="italic">cough</hi> he had: yet very friendly, and plenty of sense in him (a man <hi rend="italic">turned</hi> of 60, and perhaps 20 years in Downing Street)&#x2014;I find it always worth while to see the like of him when a chance offers. Duffy, who is in Parliam<hi rend="italic">t</hi> now, came one day;&#x2014;he with others, &#x201C;too tedious to mention&#x201C; :&#x2014;in fact, one is in no <hi rend="italic">want</hi> of &#x201C;company&#x201C; here, if only the quality of it were satisfactory!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brookfield noted of a visit to the Carlyles, <date when="1853-02-22">22 Feb.</date>: TC &#x201C;was in high good humour. Said that as a Scotchman he used to have the strongest aversion to Prelacy&#x2014;but had come to think the Church of England upon the whole about the best thing of the kind going. He spoke in the strongest language about &#x2018;our best righteousness being filthy rags&#x2019; [Isaiah 64:6]&#x201C; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:388).</note></p>
<p><closer><salute>My dear good Mother, I must end now, having still much to do, and 3 o&#x2019;clock just at hand. Ah me, ah me! work enough if it were <hi rend="italic">good</hi> for anything!&#x2014; My blessing on you all</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Here has a Note come for you &#x201C;to be forwarded&#x201C;; which will be my apology for this pusillanimous short jotting,&#x2014;done with such a pen! I got your bulletin about my Mother; many thanks to you for that. Jean, I farther compute, is leaving Moffat House this day for Scotsbrig; she was to write to me soon after seeing my Mother. The &#x201C;imaginative faculty&#x201C; opens strange views to me of those old Annandale localities and personalities, this cold snowy morning! It is coming towards five and forty years since I first set eyes on that House where you are now living,&#x2014;the image of which is very vivid to me at this moment;&#x2014;and several things have come and gone since that old afternoon when &#x201C;Tom Smaill&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Smeal is in Edinburgh Univ. Matriculation Rolls, <date when="1809">1809</date>, and <date when="1813">1813</date> where listed as of Hoddam and &#x201C;4 Lit.&#x201C; (746); see also Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 350.</note> guided me (in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">allertraurigste</hi></foreign> [gloomiest] manner) thro that undiscovered country: <foreign><hi rend="italic">eheu, eheu!</hi></foreign> Or as Graham<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham.</note> has it &#x201C;Oh whow!&#x201C;</p>
<p>We had thaw here for two days: yesterday I went out, in rather thinner clothing, to suit the kindlier temperature; rain came upon me in Belgrave Square;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 2 mi. NNE.</note> grew ever heavier on the obstinate pedestrian for about an hour; shortly after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I arrived at home, and hung up my dripping garments, thinking the weather now <hi rend="italic">decided:</hi>&#x2014; looking out an hour or two after all was white, and about 10 p.m. all nature had become <hi rend="italic">glass</hi>, and there was a north-wind, comparable to a rusty razor (without soap) on the human face! So it still lasts, sky grey &#x26; wind abated in <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi>. We are pretty well: Jane has got rid of her cold:&#x2014;I keep standing to my tools,&#x2014;too literally &#x201C;standing,&#x201C; for there is next to no <hi rend="italic">way</hi> made in any direction, nor method visible of making any. We hear nothing of Forster, nothing of Darwin; understand that they are both on the sicklist still: I have not even seen Chorley for weeks,&#x2014;who indeed is growing (if possible) more withered and abstruse than ever.&#x2014;<closer><salute>Best regards to Phoebe. &#x2014; Your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>I have fallen on a plan for recollecting Old Mary&#x2019;s money <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. Can you divine it from the date of this?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The eve of her mother&#x2019;s death, <date when="1842">1842</date>. Mary Mills.</note></p>
<p>We have the finist &#x201C;storm&#x201C; here I ever saw in London&#x2014;it is seldom that snow <hi rend="italic">lies</hi> here at all, and in former years when we had any, I was out of condition to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> it, being confined to my room!&#x2014; This time, on the first night of the snow I <hi rend="italic">walked</hi> home thro&#x2019; it from the Theatre, with my bonnet hanging on my back (!) part of the way; one minute taking myself &#x201C;a slide&#x201C; and the next lifting a handful of snow to eat it! In fact that almost forgotten scotch-looking snow had made me perfectly <hi rend="italic">drunk!</hi> or I should hardly have &#x201C;tempted Providence&#x201C; in such a distracted manner. But Providence being proverbially &#x201C;kind to women, fools and drunk people&#x201C; I had <hi rend="italic">three</hi> claims on it that night, which were duly acknowledged. and I escaped safe and sound from my snow-adventure. A few days after however I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> catch cold&#x2014;not in having my own humour out, but in doing a piece of duty&#x2014;and I have had to stay in doors&#x2014;not feeling however that the mischief is likely to last long&#x2014; Certainly that cold bath the first thing of a morning is a blessed invention!

<salute>Dear Clough,</salute>
<p>Today the American Mail goes; and I must despatch to you without delay the inclosed Piece of Paper, which was emphatically committed to me yesterday for that end: it shall go,&#x2014;tho&#x2019;, for want of time, almost nothing along with it.</p>
<p>Your last little pleasant Note was, in a day or two, forwarded to The Grange; where, as may be inferred, it found warm reception: in fact the magnanimous Lady has been writing and negociating, with the new Powers, on your behalf; and yesterday she says, &#x201C;it will be one of her happiest days&#x201C; when she can announce to you that something <hi rend="italic">has</hi> offered itself worth your accepting, and returning for. Meanwhile, here is a segment of Lord Granville&#x2019;s last Note to her Ladyship, containing an express promise to do his duty when the time does come:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton wrote Jane Brookfield, ca. <date when="1853-02-21">21 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;I saw a long letter from Mr. Clough the other day, longing to come back, but busy there with work and some, not many pupils&#x201C; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:389). Lord Granville had written as president of the council to Lady Ashburton, who had asked about an appointment for Clough: &#x201C;I have as yet had no place to give away, but the Catholic Inspectorship which I mentioned to you. The National Society require a clergyman as an inspector of their schools. I will propose Mr. Clough to the British and Foreign Society, as soon as a vacancy occurs. &#x2026; I enquired into the question of the insufficiency of British and Foreign Inspectors, but I came to the conclusion that it would not be justifiable to increase their number at present&#x201C; (<date when="1853-02-17">17 Feb.</date>; <hi rend="italic">Clough</hi> 2:386).</note>&#x2014;and this, however matters go, if you consider all the origins and tendencies of this, seems really worth sending, and cannot be other than a possession to you.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-54" n="28:54"/>In spite of your own notions and remonstrances,&#x2014;if it be in <hi rend="italic">spite</hi> of them,&#x2014;you perceive it is taken for granted, by your friends, that you are certainly to come home when the opportunity arrives. If this is really contrary to your own deliberate insight, of course they cannot bring you in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">vi et armis</hi></foreign> [with force and arms]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Livy, <hi rend="italic">Ab Urbe Condita</hi>, 26.31.7.</note> way; but the expression of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> wishes and fixed determinations on that head must also be conceded them. And that also must have its weight with you in the final decision. In fact, I cannot see what career America is likely to offer that can surpass the outlook rational enough for you here, should certain probable contingencies arrive;&#x2014;and I, for one, will continue to assert that England and old friends have a better right to you than America and new.&#x2014;&#x2014; However, no doubt you will deliberate well; and do what is wisest when the time comes.</p>
<p>Our history here has not been important since I wrote last; and of all historians I have the least ability to specify <hi rend="italic">what</hi> it particularly was or is.

    <salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
    <p>I have got a Note from John this morning, which brings me sad news of your being very ill with this bad weather aggravating your common weakness. I had feared as much! For the weather is really quite grim; and acts <hi rend="italic">hardly</hi> on many who are much stronger than you. John says you were grown a little better again, before he went away. But of course we are very anxious;&#x02014;and we hope Isabella will be so kind as write us again a little word. The weather here is growing better: the sun gets stronger daily; but the frost still continues, and everything in the shade is mere <hi rend="italic">ice</hi>. It is surely very incumbent on you to keep warm in bed, for one thing. John says they keep a good fire in your room, and continue it thro&#x02019; the night too; which is surely very proper. Let us hope the sun will visit you at Scotsbrig, and the milder air produce its improvement:&#x02014;alas, we can <hi rend="italic">do</hi> nothing here, but only hope and wish!&#x02014;</p>
    <p>I had a whiff of cold, which I felt hanging about me, during the latter days of last week: on saturday night it came to a kind of head; and commenced running away <hi rend="italic">at the nose;</hi>&#x02014;so, all yesterday too, I sat <foreign>sniftering</foreign> and sneezing, in a most ridiculous and pitiful kind of state: but today it is nearly quite over; the <foreign>
  <hi rend="italic">sniftering</hi>
</foreign> has ceased; and the feeling of cold too is mostly gone; indeed I seem almost better than I was before.&#x02014; If indeed I could get on rightly with my <hi rend="italic">work:</hi> but, alas, there are many hindrances to that; and in my own <hi rend="italic">self</hi>, where alone help could be hoped for, there is still too little help! Well, we must try to <hi rend="italic">do our best</hi>, after all;&#x02014;we are poor weak idle beings; and not worth our bread and cheese, many times, if strict account were kept! Jane continues pretty well; goes out almost daily; and we keep a good fire, and sit quietly reading at night.&#x02014; We are to go and dine with Richard Milnes this evening; which I don&#x02019;t like at all, if it could be well helped. But I will try to take care of myself there; and hope to get thro&#x02019; without considerable damage.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Brookfield reported the evening &#x0201C;a rout&#x0201D; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:390).</note> I think this is just the third time for us in these three months; and Milnes (you remember about him in Yorkshire) is one of my oldest friends. He has got married lately; a rich enough wife of quality; has a little daughter <pb id="pg-28-56" n="28:56" />(we understand); and is growing very fat and round;&#x02014;for the rest, as good humoured as ever.</p>
    <p>Poor Maccall came to see me one day; a rather distressing sight, for he is evidently in the most broken state of health, and has (that one can see) no rational outlook of making his bread in this world. To <hi rend="italic">endeavour</hi> help for the poor soul, is evidently a duty; yet what to do or try in behalf of him, is as obscure as possible!&#x02014; It is sad to think what multitudes of wretched people, as unfortunate as he and far less deserving, are wandering about the world, in the middle of all the &#x0201C;prosperity&#x0201D; we hear so much of. Prosperity,&#x02014;alas, I do not well see how &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">nuggets</hi> of gold&#x0201D; at the Diggins,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">The goldfields of Victoria, Australia.</note> going into the hands of the most <hi rend="italic">worthless</hi> of the sons of Adam there and elsewhere, can amount to much &#x0201C;prosperity&#x0201D; for us! If we saw the <hi rend="italic">tail</hi> of the account, as we see the <hi rend="italic">top</hi> and beginning of it, probably it would not look so &#x0201C;prosperous.&#x0201D;&#x02014; But enough of that.</p>
    <p>Anthony Sterling is going to <hi rend="italic">copy</hi> me your Picture,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">For Mrs. Carlyle&#x02019;s portrait, see 13:frontispiece.</note> by a machine he has, which makes on a small bit of paper really a wonderful likeness sometimes: if it succeed, I will send two to Canada, and you shall see it at Scotsbrig also.&#x02014; &#x02014;<figure>

</figure> Enough, dear Mother. Oh that I could hear you were in your old way again, and got out of this hard shadow of Winter;&#x02014;tho&#x02019;, alas, your &#x0201C;old way&#x0201D; itself is not a very high one! <closer>
  <salute>God be with us all: in His Goodness only is there hope for any soul of us. Bid Isabella write, in a day or two at farthest. Your affectionate Son</salute>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>The inclosed Letter from Bonn, indicating that the Prints had been despatched &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">by Post</hi>&#x201C;; arrived two or three days ago by that conveyance: but of the Prints, either by Post or in any other manner, there is yet no trace at Bath House, where I have just been.</p>
<p>The notion of conveyance by Post for a Parcel of such bulk w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> appear very natural to Weber, who perhaps consulted the Bonn Officials withal on the subject: but to us, with our English experiences, it looks rather ominous. What such a Packet would <hi rend="italic">cost</hi>, if, conveyed by <hi rend="italic">Post</hi> in this country, it ever did arrive;&#x2014;and practically what <hi rend="italic">has become</hi> of the Weber Packet since its reaching the Prussian frontier: that is a question! I hope you understand more about such matters than I do; but to me the business looks very confused indeed as it now stands.</p>
<p>Please return me the Weber Note, for <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have to return it;&#x2014;and on the whole I think you ought to write immediately to Weber, unless you can see some hopefuller chance involved in this <hi rend="italic">Post</hi> speculation than I can.</p>
<p>I am in extreme hurry; and have run into the L<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Library to write this line, that no time be lost.</p>
<p>Somehow or other it seems not likely the Print-Parcel can be quite <hi rend="italic">confiscated</hi>, and lost forever to the parties interested! It is only embargoed somewhere. But Weber ought to be instantly warned.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I need not say whether your last Note interested me. Our poor old Mother! Alas, she is very weak; and appears to have been very ill indeed. I got a Letter from Jean last night; but it was only her <hi rend="italic">alarmed</hi> version of what she saw <hi rend="italic">before</hi> you came; and ended with your Note to her, of the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> date as the one you had sent to me. I suppose some cold caught in the Kitchen, hearing the sermon, had perhaps been the primary cause? Your treatment was evidently the rational one; happy, that you had your means and materials as well as your ingenuities so prompt, and produced so good and speedy a result! I <pb id="pg-28-58" n="28:58"/>wrote on Monday<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1853-02-28">28 Feb.</date></note> to Scotsbrig, soliciting farther news: but of course it is to you that I look chiefly both for news, and for the practical <hi rend="italic">means</hi> of <hi rend="italic">good</hi> news: a great blessing that you are in the neighbourhood.&#x2014; &#x2014; I hope your cold is off, and the weather better; so that a second ride to Scotsbrig may not cost you such trouble. We are got into thaw here, since Tuesday; and are very <hi rend="italic">daisey</hi> and very muddy, yet with breaks of sun. I had a paltry little cold myself, caught in one of those venomous nights of frost (sleeping on the sofa after dinner): all Saturday Evening and all Sunday there was a perfect <hi rend="italic">brook</hi> of rheum and ridiculously-miserable <foreign>sniftering</foreign> &#x26; sneezing; but that proved the <hi rend="italic">crisis</hi>, and I ail but little since. On Monday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> I even accompanied Jane to dine at the Milnes&#x2019;s: a biggish company of miscellanies, mostly rather ugly,&#x2014;Mrs Crowe (&#x201C;Nightside of Nature&#x201C;), an elderly fashionable Lady with one of her <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> relaxed &#x26; hanging: she with Lady Davy, aged Mummy, might be said to dispute the palm!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Crowe, author of <hi rend="italic">The Night Side of Nature; or, Ghosts and Ghost Seers</hi>, 2 vols.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I am charmed to hear you say there is no danger of these Bonn Prints.</p>
<p>As the Ashburtons are all in the country, and the affair is wholly entrusted <pb id="pg-28-59" n="28:59"/>to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to bring into order (with only Doyle, a noted Engraver, to help in selecting from the duplicate Prints), you will oblige me very much if you will yourself undertake this preliminary function of getting the Packet home to Bath House,&#x2014;from the Custom house, or from Regent&#x2019;s Circus,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Now Piccadilly Circus.</note> or wherever it may be. You know how helpless I am in regard to such things! Permit me therefore to be so impudent as to make this request.</p>
<p>Whatever money is due, please pay out at once, and I will refund. And have the goodness to report progress, and let us get the whole thing <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, as soon as possible! I cannot write to warn Doyle to meet me till this preliminary part is finished.</p>
<p>We are at home every ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> this week; I daily going out, as usual, about 3.&#x2014; On Sunday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> poor little Mont&#xE9;gut is coming, to take farewell on returning to Paris.</p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>A gentleman of the name of Magrath, who writes a scraggy hand, but in a civil style and with pleasant news, informs me last night that I am elected to the Athenaeum on Tuesday last &#x201C;under Article 2 of the rules&#x201C;; and that at this date, apparently by the special interposition of Heaven (for he says nothing about <hi rend="italic">monies</hi> or other vulgar terrestrial objects), I am actually a member of that honourable Club!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Athenaeum Club, Pall Mall; See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480310-TC-RMM-01"><sic>22:268</sic><corr>TC to RMM, <date when="1848-03-10">10 March 1848</date></corr></ref>. Edward Magrath (d. <date when="1855">1855</date>), asst. at the Royal Inst., second sec. of the club, <date when="1824">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855">55</date>. Most members were elected by ballot, though under rule two &#x201C;the Committee&#x201C; might yearly elect up to nine people of &#x201C;distinguished eminence in science, literature, or the arts, or for the public services.&#x201C; Among the other eight men elected in <date when="1853">1853</date> were George Thomas Keppel, 6th Earl of Albemarle; William Fairbairn (<date when="1789">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874">1874</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9067"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), engineer and bridge builder; and Francis Grant (<date when="1803">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-03">78</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11257"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), portrait painter.</note></p>
<p>Really I begin to be ashamed of myself; and, now that I have reflected on it, know not what to say:&#x2014;better perhaps that I <hi rend="italic">say</hi> almost nothing! Certainly there are munificent souls still extant in this world; certainly here is one of the handsomest acts done in the handsomest manner! You have really given me a very pretty Freehold for the rest of my life; and in a way that cannot be refused,&#x2014;that can only be accepted, with a feeling which is itself a real possession to one. I do return many thanks; and will not speak another <pb id="pg-28-60" n="28:60"/>word.&#x2014; &#x2014; It is certain, except for this or some such miracle, I should never have been a member of any Club: and we will take the <hi rend="italic">consequences</hi>, which may really be considerable for me, with <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>. For the rest, I will not enter the place till after your arrival on Monday; and you shall introduce me, some evening while you are here,&#x2014;to the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Club</hi> Epoch&#x201C; of my existence, if peradventure any &#x201C;epoch&#x201C; lie in that! We shall see.</p>
<p>Neuberg&#x2019;s Note here inclosed is not worth anything except as a sign that My Lady&#x2019;s German Prints are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in jeopardy by having been committed to the Post, as my apprehension was: I wrote to Neuberg again last night; and probably he is at this very hour girding himself together to negociate about them. By Saturday one might almost fancy they would be in Bath House; after which event I will directly write to Doyle;&#x2014;and so, on Monday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, perhaps the whole matter might lie ready for the royal sanction; the rejected Prints laid on one side, the accepted on another, and nothing needed farther but <foreign><hi rend="italic">la reine le veut</hi></foreign> or (dreadful to think of) <foreign><hi rend="italic">la reine s&#x2019;avisera!</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The queen wills it,&#x201C; signifying royal approval of a new law, and &#x201C;the queen will take it under advice,&#x201C; signifying delay.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I get on shockingly ill with what I call my <hi rend="italic">work;</hi> alas, I seem fast losing the <hi rend="italic">tradition</hi> of what practically deserves the name of &#x201C;work&#x201C;; and look sometimes as if I should never work more in this world, but only saunter and stagger, and painfully <hi rend="italic">lean</hi> upon my picks and shovels, <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> at the unspeakable mud-quarry! The prayers of The Grange are desired for one in great distress.</p>
<p>Our weather too is still very harsh, tho&#x2019; it pretends to a kind of thaw; nothing but rumours of sick people near and far. I hope My Lady keeps well within doors; and rallies strength for Monday next. <closer><salute>I send my blessings and regards; and am always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>The Prints are <hi rend="italic">come;</hi> arrived at Bath House of their own accord today; and are now (also of their own accord, and by make rather!) lying <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. A thin <pb id="pg-28-61" n="28:61"/>Parcel, in oilskin; weighing some 3 lbs or so,&#x2014;charge &#xa3;1.7.0. Safe, but excessively dear! I have not yet looked into the ware itself:&#x2014;but write to say that, of course, there is nothing farther to be done by <hi rend="italic">you</hi> till you hear from me again.</p>
<p>I am about appointing Doyle to meet me on Saturday afternoon; the Lady herself is to be in town on Monday evening: after that, I suppose, the thing will be finished, or all ready for finishing.</p>
<p>This is a mistake of about a sovereign, this of sending the Parcel by <hi rend="italic">Post;</hi> but happily that is all, and it might have been <hi rend="italic">worse</hi>. The Duplicates we will <hi rend="italic">return</hi>, I conclude, by Nutt and Asher of Berlin.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Nutt, (<date when="1810-03">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-03">63</date>; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431204-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>17:197</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1843-12-04">4 Dec. 1843</date></corr></ref>), foreign bookseller, 270 Strand.

<salute>Dear Doyle,</salute>
<p>The Prints, concerning which Lady Ashburton wrote to you, are at length <hi rend="italic">come:</hi> I have them now by me (for they have been brought hither by a kind of mistake), but I have not yet looked into them. The question is now, When can you come to give your judgement?</p>
<p>By way of saving time, and perhaps other trouble, I propose at once, That you meet me on Saturday at 3 p.m at Bath House, where Prints, Print-seller&#x2019;s List, and all other needful apparatus shall be (even a fire in the room is bespoken, and the servant is warned to expect us if he hear nothing to the contrary),&#x2014;and I should think we might, in no long period, get thro&#x2019; this little bit of business.</p>
<p>Saturday at 3 p.m. precise, then, if it suit you: if that do not suit, then please appoint another time,&#x2014;any other,&#x2014;and I will try to keep it.</p>
<p>If I hear <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, I shall <hi rend="italic">suppose</hi> you are coming; but it will be more satisfactory if you write&#x2014;</p>

I should have been in a great alarm had your Letter reached me <hi rend="italic">first;</hi> but having your <hi rend="italic">date</hi>, and having already a later account, I was more composed. Our poor old Mother!

<p>I can gather but little out of Isabella&#x2019;s Letter: however, it seems on the whole, as if things were much in their <hi rend="italic">general</hi> weak way again, only aggravated by the bad weather. We have rain here, genuine westerly rain, tonight; and everywhere, let us hope, there must rapidly be a change in the weather,&#x2014;for our good old Mother&#x2019;s sake, as for so many other sakes.</p>
<p>Poor Jane has taken a bad headache today;&#x2014;and even now cries to me, thro&#x2019; the wall (from her bed where she has taken refuge) that I must give up writing.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Those Letters of Goethe are very good in their way; <hi rend="italic">Jerusalems Tod</hi> &#x26;c very good; and the whole story of Werter, with its Documents, will have a Biographic interest which must render them permanently valuable.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Goethe&#x2019;s letters to Charlotte Kestner and &#x201C;<foreign>Kestner&#x2019;s Nachrichten &#xfc;ber den Tod Jerusalems</foreign>&#x201C; [report of Jerusalem&#x2019;s death], <hi rend="italic">Goethe und Werther</hi> 86&#x2013;101, see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530203-TC-CKJB-01">TC to CKJB, <date when="1853-02-03">3 Feb.</date></ref> K. W. Jerusalem was their acquaintance whose suicide over an unhappy love affair gave Goethe part of the inspiration for <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi>.</note></p>
<p>But, alas, the thing wanted for this book seems not somebody to translate it, but somebody to write it! I venture to predict that it can expect no success at all in England, if merely <hi rend="italic">translated</hi> in its present form. The Editor, I lament to observe, seems a mere mass of chaff and wind; and doesn&#x2019;t in the least understand what is wanted of him. I defy anybody to <hi rend="italic">read</hi> these Letters as they at present stand, <hi rend="small-caps">unless</hi> he had lived, first 79 years ago at Wetzlar,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A small town in Hesse on the river Lahn, once a provincial capital, and seat of the Imperial Court of Justice in Goethe&#x2019;s day.</note> then 50 years ago at Hanover as Boarder in the Kestner Household, and in the meanwhile had visited much ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Frankfurt, Darmstadt, C&#xF6;ln and all along the Rhine Country! Nay the Editor himself appears not to have <hi rend="italic">read</hi> them: at least it is quite clear, from one of the last of these present letters of Goethe, that G. <hi rend="italic">was</hi> at Wetzlar again after his <foreign>Hegira</foreign> [flight] to Frankfurt, and passed a day or more with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Liebenden</hi></foreign> [lovers], and even was defrauded of his <hi rend="italic">kiss</hi> on leaving. Of which the Editor, with his sublime asseverations and reiterations that said Hegira was &#x201C;eternal&#x201C; &#x26;c appears not to have the least perception.</p>
<p>But as to the English in particular,&#x2014;what does any living Englishman know of the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">visitation</hi>&#x201C; at Wetzlar (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> might be explained in half a page); of Friedberg, Schmidtgasse, the Deutsche Haus &#x26;c &#x26;c; or what can he make of Letters crammed to the brim with still more recondite allusions, which only a &#x201C;Boarder in the Kestner household 50 years ago&#x201C; could give a guess at?&#x2014;An &#x2018;Editor&#x2019; who instead of manfully, with the utmost <hi rend="italic">brevity</hi> and the utmost <hi rend="italic">precision</hi>, explaining all these things, or saying at once, &#x201C;I cannot,&#x201C; will launch out into floods of vapid palaver and eloquent commonplace,&#x2014;such Editor belongs to the intolerable class!&#x2014; In short, my dear Sir, I strongly advise you to have nothing to do with this business; and indeed, in spite of your ever-abounding good-nature, and readiness to help all creatures, I conclude you will have arrived at that result already for yourself!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-64" n="28:64"/>The other day, meeting Pauli<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reinhold Pauli (<date when="1823">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">82</date>), private sec. to Bunsen, <date when="1849">1849</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852">52</date>; later historian and author, esp. of books on English history.</note> in the London Library, I charged him with a little petition to you in regard to Dr Abeken;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530204-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1853-02-04">4 Feb.</date></ref></note> which, at the risk of slaying the slain, I will repeat. Please assure Abeken, by the very first opportunity, that all I ask of him, or have a right to ask, or do essentially <hi rend="italic">want</hi>, is an answer, <hi rend="italic">some</hi> answer. Perhaps he never got the Letter, tho&#x2019; I posted it myself with all precautions? At any rate, if he cannot get me those Books, there are a thousand other resources in that event,&#x2014;perhaps it is even <hi rend="italic">better</hi> that he cannot get them, such as they are like to be;&#x2014;and the only quite fatal loss for a man is that of time, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am now undergoing, or painfully liable to undergo.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Sir,&#x2014;</salute>This was written yesterday for the use of Dickens, in the case of <hi rend="italic">Maccall</hi>,&#x2014;keeping the name veiled under the cover &#x201C;B. D.&#x201C; I did not send it to Mr Dickens, having in the interim decided to go at once to yourself.

I also enclose D&#x2019;s Letter to me, which please return.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dickens had written to TC from Brighton, <date when="1853-03-04">4 March</date>, giving instructions and explaining that if Maccall &#x201C;be in such health that he can go out of doors, he will receive from Mr. Blewitt every possible attention and guidance. If he be not forthcoming, a word from you to the same gentleman would be all powerful. If you feel the least difficulty in moving in the matter &#x2026; send the case to me, and I will do so, gladly. Lastly, if three guineas will be of any use to our unfortunate brother, I will place them at your disposal for him. &#x2026; I am not now one of the relieving board, but I belong to an amazing body called the council&#x2014;whose function I have never been able to discover&#x2014;and I believe my name would quicken a dull ear if his claim were addressed to any such.&#x201C;</note></p>

<p><title><hi rend="italic">Case of B.D</hi>. (in reference to <hi rend="italic">Literary Fund</hi>)</title></p>
<p>Educated at Glasgow University, then at Geneva; became a Unitarian Clergyman, first in the North of England then in the South,&#x2014;distinguishing himself by high moral conduct, vehement sincerity of character, and a great turn for abstruse and independent philosophical speculation. <hi rend="italic">Outgrew</hi> the Unitarian Theorem of Things; and had, doubtless after much internal struggle, but in obedience to conscience and higher calls, to quit his Congregation and Profession,&#x2014;perhaps about ten years ago,&#x2014;on the vague outlook of making Literature suffice for his objects. He had already published various little Books (small Pamphlets rather) in the Country; some of which I have seen: all are on Theologico-moral subjects, or rather on one such subject taken up on various sides (which is B. D.&#x2019;s great idea and <hi rend="italic">text</hi> in this world),&#x2014;earnest <hi rend="italic">shrill-voiced</hi> Pieces, full of heroic conviction, and indicating no inconsiderable faculty of original thought, but quite unlikely to find general audience from the public. B.D. had wedded while in the North of England; had, and has still, one Child, and an excellent thrifty courageous wife prepared to front all kinds of fortune with him.</p>
<p>B.D.&#x2019;s history during these ten years has been one continuous silently indignant struggle against a world of contradiction, unenlivened by any victory, or promise of victory. He has written a great many things, not only on his old subjects, but on more popular ones (Literary Biographies &#x26;c in magazines and other Periodicals); and has been faithful, ardently prompt and zealous, in whatever he could get to do: his talents too are <hi rend="italic">intrinsically</hi> very considerable for writing; and one feels that he well deserves a hearing from his contemporaries, but also alas that he has little chance to get one for those little Books of his, and the high-soaring Theologies and Martyr Heroisms that are in them. One of the truest men, but thin-skinned, &#x201C;shrill-voiced&#x201C; (as I said), wrapt up in shy reserves: steeped in poverty and ill-success, and yet with a pride in him (as I can see, tho&#x2019; perhaps he cannot) equal to the pride of emperors, or of gods,&#x2014;these are a distressing set of contradictions for a man! A small perceptible vein of humour is the most genial feature of B.D.; bitter as absynth, as wormwood; but clear and wholesome, and flavouring agreeably, in that manner, the austere truths and clear judgments one gets from him on men and things. Such is B.D.</p>
<p>He has endured, on his own resources, silently, and really with a manful dignity, the narrowest condition of finance, ever since he adopted this Literary <pb id="pg-28-66" n="28:66"/>course of life. I believe he has, for most part, still had some kind of slight connexion with his old business,&#x2014;preaching occasionally to some small audience, here or there, of the least <hi rend="italic">tight laced</hi> Unitarian species;&#x2014;otherwise he could not have lived by his earnings in writing.</p>
<p>Within the last two years I saw less of him than usual, but perceived that he was going on his course at a swifter rate, and getting more impetuously determined than ever. He laboured incessantly, in small Periodicals &#x26;c &#x26;c, with a prodigal excess (as I now find), and would not and could not stop; till at last, some months ago, he broke down into Brain-fever of the most alarming kind;&#x2014;and is now in utter weakness; and <hi rend="italic">lost</hi>, if he cannot get rest and help. I believe he contemplates abandoning the business of <hi rend="italic">writing</hi>, and wishes to resume in some form his old business of <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi>, as &#x201C;lecturing,&#x201C; or the like&#x2014;which probably is a judicious notion.</p>
<p>These are the main features of B.D.&#x2019;s case, correctly true, so far as I can give them: you can now tell me whether it is suitable to the Literary Fund; and above all (for this is the essential point for the poor &#x26; proud B.D.) whether there is not danger of being <hi rend="italic">refused</hi> on applying?</p>

<p>Poor M. looks a great deal better within the last week.

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley,</salute>
<p>I am so ill off at present, held down by paltry sneezing colds &#x26;c &#x26;c, which do not seem to be on the mending hand but on the opposite one, that, alas, I dare not engage for Wednesday night; but must, like a virtuous man, deny myself beforehand a great pleasure. You, if you have any humanity left, will pity me, and not despise me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>One of these days I mean to call, and convince myself that you are in Town; a cheerful fact which somehow has, all this while, seemed to my sick fancy to require confirmation.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have just got Isabella&#x2019;s Letter to Jean, kindly forwarded to me from Dumfries, as I am on the point of going out for the afternoon; and certainly it is the best &#x201C;pennyworth&#x201C; that has been spent on me this long time! It has taken a huge load from my sickly spirits; which had been weighing me down night and day for a week past, let me do what I could. Let us be thankful, let us be thankful!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have heard nothing from the Doctor, and was much disappointed this morning, but strove against sad surmises. Isabella&#x2019;s Note to myself came duly,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1853-03-04">4 March</date>.</note> for which give her my thanks; I saw it was the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> news she had to send, and so remained in my uncertainties.&#x2014; You have evidently had a very bad turn, Mother dear; and must <hi rend="italic">keep out of the cold</hi> by all manner of means: we have now weather here almost as warm as summer, and very soft and muddy; but there will come sharp blasts again, and I entreat you take care of them! That frost is really insupportable to thinskinned weak creatures: I dislike London mud, and the heavy wet-blanket of the West; but it is welcome indeed, in comparison with what it has succeeded. I am now getting my hands <hi rend="italic">cleaned</hi> again, which were all <hi rend="italic">cracky</hi>, and could not be washed white even by hot water.</p>
<p>We are well enough, both of us; and greatly relieved by the little Note just come. Again thanks to all,&#x2014;and thanks to the Giver of Good first of all. I run <pb id="pg-28-68" n="28:68"/>out with a lighter heart; and will write soon more at length. Jamie&#x2019;s Newspaper is not come: but there are two for you, and now, I conclude, you will be able to read again. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came on Monday Evening; I was greatly disappointed in the morning at the <hi rend="italic">want</hi> of it; and went about in a very disconsolate feeble humour till 11 o&#x2019;clock, when a Note from Jean (or properly a Note of <hi rend="italic">Isabella&#x2019;s</hi> forwarded by Jean) arrived, and cheered me with the good news. Your Letter in the evening was welcome confirmation, and expansion into the details. Our poor old Mother, she had evidently been in great trouble indeed; and, alas, there is so little strength now to work upon, and one&#x2019;s imagination dwells gloomily on the worst possibilities! Thanks to you for all your attention to me and to those dear to me.</p>
<p>Poor old Gibson has got to his rest, then; the far-travelling rugged man has set up his staff, and remains motionless and silent henceforth.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Gibson, Scottish-born American merchant; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350817-TC-JCA-01"><sic>8:198</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1835-08-17">17 Aug. 1835</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390820-TC-JWC-01"><sic>11:171</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1839-08-20">20 Aug. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> Poor old fellow, we were sensibly affected to hear it; we acknowledged, however, that his last end, so speedy, had been merciful.

<p>All goes on here much as it did. We have now pleasant westerly spring weather; but expect wild blasts still: weak <hi rend="italic">livers</hi>, in the meanwhile, are still in some disorder with us; poor Jane complains of almost constant <hi rend="italic">sickliness</hi> in the stomach,&#x2014;sick nausea there, alternating with headache of a new kind:&#x2014;however, she holds up valiantly, and is even now out, in the brisk air, with Nero.&#x2014; I myself begin to find that <hi rend="italic">water-cure</hi> (drinking of much water for the stomach&#x2019;s sake) is no recipe; and have discontinued it WITH PROTEST!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Underlined three times.</note> It did save me other medicine; but, alas, I find there is no other medicine so ruinous to all strength in those regions!&#x2014; For the rest, I begin to <hi rend="italic">try</hi> more seriously to get something gradually brought to paper, in this sad affair of Fritz; that I may see at least, afar off, some possibility of a deliverance from it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Cosa fatta ha capo;</hi></foreign><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>The Ashburtons lately have done unexpectedly a really handsome thing to me.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Literary Fund</hi> has acted truly like the &#x201C;good Samaritan&#x201C; to poor Maccall; and I, for my own part, do heartily thank you and all the Gentlemen concerned in the transaction. It seems to me farther that this liberal and handsome Gift, so promptly and handsomely bestowed,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maccall&#x2019;s application had been considered, <date when="1853-03-09">9 March</date>, and he was given &#xa3;40 by Blewitt, <date when="1853-03-10">10 March</date>.</note> may really prove a <pb id="pg-28-70" n="28:70"/><hi rend="italic">good investment</hi> of Human Charity, and do essential service to a man of merit in distress.</p>
<p>I do not see the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> Newspaper or hear or know what criticisms are flung at your Institution;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Literary Fund had been under fierce attack by C. W. Dilke (<date when="1810">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869">69</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7646"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), editor of the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, who had been joined by Dickens, John Forster, and others.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We got Isabella&#x2019;s Packet this morning, and I have already folded it up for Dumfries; Jean will send it on to Moffat probably on Monday. I need not say how glad we were to hear that you continue in your old tolerable way, and have no more of those bad fits. The weather here is now quite like spring: sunny, brisk, one day it was very warm; but the wind has now turned northerly again, and we have a temperature sharp enough, but natural to the season. I think you will be cautious of venturing out, beyond the <foreign><hi rend="italic">bield</hi></foreign> of the Garden fence, even if you have it as sunny as we! Take care of yourself, dear Mother; and let us wait patiently for more genial days, which cannot be far off now.&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x2014;(Just as I began writing this, there has come a body of vagrant <hi rend="italic">musical</hi> scamps, under my windows, with <hi rend="italic">clatter-bones</hi>, guitars and Nigger songs; which they are doing with a vigour beyond example, in hopes of a copper or two from somebody. Not from me surely! I could order them off, if I liked to shove up the window, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">golly</hi></foreign> down upon them like a &#x201C;living Saracen&#x2019;s Head,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Saracen&#x2019;s Head&#x201C; was a common name for inns with signs showing Saracens with terrible faces.</note>&#x2014;as I sometimes do. I will rather put up with it for the present; and you will excuse any confusion I fall into. Poor souls, they too would fain <hi rend="italic">live;</hi> and one cannot think the Nigger Song a very opulent fund of subsistence for them!)&#x2014;</p>
<p>Maccall, of whom I wrote, is getting on better now: I went to him about a week ago; found a marked improvement of health;&#x2014;and today a Charitable institution called the <hi rend="italic">Literary Fund</hi>, with whom I had negociated for him, writes to me (as Maccall himself does) that the &#x201C;Committee have given him &#xa3;40, on my recommendation&#x201C;; which really is very fine, and will perhaps set the poor soul up, and into some wholesomer way of existing: at all events, I am very handsomely relieved of him, and glad to be so.</p>
<p>I must tell you of another pleasant thing that has happened to me; or rather Jack will tell you, and explain anything you cannot understand of it: the thing is this. I was never member of any club, nor ever should have been, as almost all the men of my circle are here. But it costs &#xa3;25 or so of entrance, and &#xa3;5 or &#xa3;6 a year besides, for the privilege of going in to see Books, Newspapers, your Acquaintances,&#x2014;and also of treating the place like the cheapest and royallest of coffee houses (getting refreshment, dining, lounging on sofas &#x26;c) according to your pleasure:&#x2014;and it always seemed to me too dear, and I had no <pb id="pg-28-74" n="28:74"/>desire for it. However, Lord Ashburton, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> appear, had privately determined this spring to have it done, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> consulting me; and now it is done, and I am member of what is thought to be the best club of all, the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum;</hi> &#x26; all the money, both entrance and annual, is secretly paid for me, and the election (which needed to be <hi rend="italic">unanimous</hi>, by a new law, and so was a thing of anxiety) all has been transacted without my ever knowing it, and I am, as it were, brought in in my sleep! I do not expect I shall ever very much use my privilege; but certainly it was a kind and handsome gift to make, and ought to give me pleasure, and does, a little. Men wait for 7 years sometimes before they can be so much as balloted for (only &#x201C;famous&#x201C; people, can be elected in this way <hi rend="italic">at once</hi>), and then they have to pay (if they do it in a lump, and not annually), I suppose, &#xa3;100 or better. &#x201C;A good gift&#x201C; indeed!</p>
<p>The Nigger Songsters are off elsewhither with their clatterbones, some time ago; but my paper and time&#x2014;alas!&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane is pretty well; out, this fine day; gone visiting, I suppose. I too am trying to be busy. <closer><salute>Let us be thankful, dear old Mother, let us be thankful, and <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> forever! My blessings to all.</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>In many German Books about Frederick the Great, I find notices of a certain <hi rend="italic">Signora Barberini</hi>, an amazingly clever and beautiful Opera-dancer, and of a &#x201C;Scotchman Mr MacKenzie&#x201C; whose adventures are connected with hers and with the History of Frederick. The story is this.</p>
<p>Barberini had been engaged at Venice for Frederick&#x2019;s Berlin Opera, in <date when="1744">1744</date>, at a high salary, but did not come as was expected; on inquiry it was found a rich young Scotchman of quality, &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> MacKenzie, &#x201C; had fallen in love with her at Venice, was about to marry her, and that she <hi rend="italic">would not</hi> come. Frederick applied to the Senate of Venice, shewing his clear fixed bargain with Barberini; but they took no steps: he then <hi rend="italic">impounded</hi> the effects of their Ambassador at Berlin, who was just going towards England, had his trunks remained free;&#x2014;upon which the Venetian Senate did lay hold of Barberini; delivered her, under military escort, to the Austrian authorities on their frontier; who forwarded her duly, under the like, to the Saxons; and they again to Berlin, where she did actually dance and shine many years, and made a fine marriage at last. Poor MacKenzie followed in the rear thro&#x2019; all this long military march of the Barberini; came to Berlin close behind her; and staid <pb id="pg-28-75" n="28:75"/>there some time (still in <date when="1744">1744</date>) determined to wed her;&#x2014;till Frederick, by applying to his friends in Britain or by some other good method, put an end to the speculation.&#x2014; Of the facts thus far there is no doubt whatever. Zimmermann (Author of <hi rend="italic">Solitude</hi>, who has written some wild pieces about Frederick) adds, what is very doubtful, That MacKenzie all his life hated Frederick in consequence; farther that he, MacKenzie, was a Kinsman of Earl Bute the first Prime Minister of George III, into whom he infused his own hatred of Fred<hi rend="italic">k;</hi> by means of <hi rend="italic">which</hi> (says Zimmermann) the &#x201C;shameful separate peace&#x201C; was made by England, and Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> left in the lurch, at the end of the seven-years war! This latter clause of the story may be accounted very doubtful indeed;&#x2014;or perhaps if the MacKenzies were not related to the Butes at all, is not <hi rend="italic">doubtful</hi>, but certainly false, as I suspect?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC tells the story in <hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 15:493&#x2013;97. Johann Georg Zimmermann (<date when="1728">1728</date>&#x2013;<date when="1795">95</date>), Swiss physician and philosopher, attended Frederick in his last illness. His book on solitude <hi rend="italic">Betrachtungen &#xfc;ber die Einsamkeit</hi> (<date when="1756">1756</date>) became <hi rend="italic">&#xdc;ber die Einsamkeit</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1784">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1785">85</date>) 4 vols., see <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:132&#x2013;33, 293). TC cites his <hi rend="italic">Fragmente &#xfc;ber Friedrich den Grossen</hi>, 3 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1790">1790</date>) for the story about Barberini and James Mackenzie (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 15:494) and calls Zimmermann&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Ueber Friedrich den Grossen und meine Unterredungen mit ihm kurz von seinem Tode</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1788">1788</date>), &#x201C;a Book &#x2026; which made immense noise in the world, and is still read, with little profit or none, by inquirers into Friedrich. Thirty-three Dialogues, throwing no new light on Friedrich&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:292). Both books are HCC.</note></p>
<p>This gallant MacKenzie and his Barberini adventures do not concern me much; nor is it worth any friend&#x2019;s while to take much trouble about him for me. But it has struck me I would tell you of the thing. Perhaps you are yourself a bit of a genealogist; or, if not, perhaps you know some accurate man who understands the Clan MacKenzie (its Seaforths &#x26;c &#x26;c) sufficiently to identify this Historical young amorous gentleman, and inform me who and what he was,&#x2014;and especially whether related at all to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic"><foreign>Braw</foreign> Johnny Bute</hi>,&#x201C; as Zimmermann babbles.&#x2014; Any time; there is no hurry.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mackenzie answered, a few days later, with a genealogy of James Stuart MacKenzie (<date when="1718">1718</date>&#x2013;<date when="1800">1800</date>), &#x201C;Barberini&#x2019;s adorer;&#x201C; he inherited &#x201C;the large estate of his grandmother,&#x201C; Agnes, b. MacKenzie (<date when="1663">1663</date>&#x2013;<date when="1696">96</date>), wife of James Stuart, 1st earl of Bute, and added the name of Mackenzie. He was M.P. for Argyllshire, <date when="1842">1842</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847">47</date>; m., <date when="1749">1749</date>, his cousin Lady Elizabeth Campbell (d. <date when="1799">1799</date>); and was brother of John Stuart (<date when="1713">1713</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792">92</date>), 3rd earl of Bute (&#x201C;<foreign>Braw</foreign> Johnny Bute&#x201C;), in effect George III&#x2019;s first prime minister, <date when="1760">1760</date>&#x2013;<date when="1761">61</date>, and in name also <date when="1762">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1763">63</date>. James Mackenzie did not mention the other MacKenzies who were earls of Seaforth. &#x201C;I remember when a boy almost, reading a translation of Zimmerman&#x2019;s Solitude and being persuaded that I ought to like and admire it, altho I have a shrew&#x2019;d suspicion, for I have never seen it since, that it is but poor stuff&#x2014;singularly unlike the real history of Frederic and not less unlike what you will indite regarding him.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>I am very sorry indeed to say, the Book you sent me long ago, so kindly about <hi rend="italic">William Wallace</hi>, which was a very good Book of its kind, is for the <pb id="pg-28-76" n="28:76"/>present in an eclipsed condition,&#x2014;unattainable to me, or I would have returned it months ago!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520105-TC-TE-01"><sic>27:4</sic><corr>TC to TE, <date when="1852-01-05">5 Jan. 1852</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520116-TC-JAMA-01"><sic>14</sic><corr>TC to JAMA, <date when="1852-01-16">16 Jan. 1852</date></corr></ref>. Mackenzie replied: &#x201C;Pray do not bother yourself about the Vol. of records as to Wallace. It is really of little or no value to me.&#x201C;</note> Last summer there came carpenters, masons, plasterers, painters (what they call a &#x201C;thorough repair&#x201C;) into this poor house; drove me to Germany, and indeed almost drove me mad;&#x2014;and at my return, in putting up my Books again, this, to my especial sorrow, was one of the two or so which could not be discovered! If the Book prove ultimately to be lost, my duty next in regard to it is, of course, very clear: but these precious repairs are not even yet completed, nor is the house yet in pristine order: so I will beg you to be patient with me for a while still.</p>
<p>I have not heard anything direct from Erskine this long while; but I was three weeks with him last summer, in my sad <hi rend="italic">Hegira</hi> while you were out of the way;&#x2014;and I hear that he is prosperous and often about Edinburgh. If you have opportunity, forget not my kind and grateful remembrances to him.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mackenzie wrote: &#x201C;I saw Erskine t&#x2019;other day and gave him your remembrances. I should have been glad to have met you at his House during your wanderings. I know you feel for Him as I do&#x2014;a man having the reality of what others content themselves with speaking about, and what if really held is to the holder a wondrous and constant blessing. Talked about merely it is to all a sad weariness.&#x201C; Mackenzie enclosed a note from &#x201C;the daughter of our Clan&#x2019;s late Chief&#x201C; corroborating what he had written about MacKenzie.</note>&#x2014;<closer><salute>I remain always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Marshall,</salute>
<p>I got your Letter some ten days ago; and was very glad to hear of you again, and understand that I was not forgotten in Weimar. No spot in my travels looks brighter to me than that interesting little city; if I were a painter I could put it all on canvas by help of memory,&#x2014;the Ettersburg, pretty Belvedere, Tiefurth,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ducal residence, seen by TC on his visit in <date when="1852">1852</date>.</note> Goethe&#x2019;s House, Schiller&#x2019;s House and Death-chamber: all this and more, winding up with your emphatic final remonstrance to the railway porter, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Sie <hi rend="small-caps">m&#xfc;ssen</hi> warten</hi></foreign> [You must wait]!,&#x201C; remains with me vivid as reality, and is like to remain. Thanks to the kind friends that made it pleasant,&#x2014;thanks to you chiefly who stood at the centre of the operation! I was in the contemptiblest state of wretchedness on the physical side; and you had a rather heavy task, I do perceive; but, by dint of dextrous assiduity and imperturbable good humour, you managed it,&#x2014;more power to your elbow! <pb id="pg-28-77" n="28:77"/>The remembrance of those unendurable physical confusions, want of bed-curtains, want of sleep, want of &#x26;c &#x26;c, enough to drive a poor thin skinned wretch to the verge of Bedlam in the end, is gradually dying away; falling down like foul bewildering dust; and the essential phenomenon itself will remain in a clear state, and continue to be a possession for me. That the Imperial Lady, her Highness the Grand Duchess, still remembers me, is a great honour; for which I will beg you, in some good time and way, to express my human gratitudes,&#x2014;as surely they are well due in that quarter; nor is anything of Belvedere, least of all the noble Mistress of it, likely to be forgotten on my side.</p>
<p>We did not see Eckermann at Berlin, as you are aware; by a curious infelicity he had again fled, two days before our appearance there. I was very sorry; two intimate English friends, lady sisters familiars of my wifes, who come often about us here, had waited nearly a week in the Royal H&#xF4; tel under the Lindens for us,&#x2014;and just gone two hours, when we came to lodge there!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Williams Wynn and her sister Harriot; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521001-TC-JWC-01"><sic>27:314</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1852-10-01">1 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> My more and more feverish distraction of nerves, to which none of those kind souls could have brought any remedy, made such misfortunes at once more sad to me and more indifferent,&#x2014;new showers upon a rat already <hi rend="italic">drowned</hi>, all but the inner imagination of him! The search for Eckermann, however, procured us accidentally the Painter Magnus&#x2019;s acquaintance, who proved to be a truly superior painter and person, full of helpfulness withal, and one of my chief resources while in Berlin. Ten days or a fortnight there: but I made nothing of it; I met with hardly any man worth going ten yards to see; what was still sadder, hardly any man or thing that could give me the least instruction about my hero Fritz: all the world was full of talk about their big Rauch&#x2019;s monument, and seemed to think <hi rend="italic">that</hi> had done the whole business,&#x2014;while, alas, I found that that had done simply no &#x201C;business&#x201C; at all (except perhaps consecrate the &#x201C;artistic,&#x201C; pedantic, and other expensive <hi rend="italic">Owleries</hi> of poor mankind), and that, for an inquiring soul with reason and a heart in him, Rauch and his copper mountain were not intended! Had it not been for Magnus I do not even think I should have discovered any real Portrait of Fritz at Berlin: no mortal seemed to know of such a thing, or to be in the least want of it; Rauch himself, a fine mild ingenious old gentleman, had astonishingly little to say on that or any cognate subject. And in the Royal Library too&#x2014; But let me say nothing more of all that; let me remember only how good every one was to me, how patient with the foreign savage and his disappointments and indignations Of a truth, if Frederic the Great did injury to German Literature and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunst</hi></foreign> [art], said <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunst</hi></foreign> and Literature have richly paid him back again! I said to myself a hundred times, Ye speaking, painting, dissertating, poetizing, most &#x201C;artistic&#x201C; (<foreign><hi rend="italic">vorstellungsf&#xE4;hig</hi></foreign> [imaginative]) German People, <pb id="pg-28-78" n="28:78"/>is <hi rend="italic">this</hi> then all you can do to &#x201C;represent&#x201C; a great man and hero, when the gods send you one?

I saw big Radowitz, and shall not <hi rend="italic">forget</hi> him; Cornelius,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Cornelius (<date when="1783">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867">1867</date>) with Johann Friedrich Overbeck (<date when="1789">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869">1869</date>) and others formed the Nazarenes, who established themselves at a convent in Rome aiming to restore Christian art to its medieval purity. On return to Germany, he worked in the same way and revived interest in murals.</note> and many persons doing the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Catolisch</hi></foreign> [Roman Catholic],&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott:</hi></foreign> &#x201C;doing&#x201C; it; which is forever damnable! By far the beautifullest thing, indeed the only truly beautiful thing I saw in Berlin, was good and brave old Tieck, pathetically bright like the setting sun; lying on his sofa now, not to rise any more, his race being run.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tieck died <date when="1853-04-28">28 April</date>.</note></p>
<p>On the whole I made but little of Germany; and have to admit that my journey (by blame of my own, I am aware) was somewhat of a failure. Nevertheless I do remember the Rhine stream and its banks; the image of a grand world-river, I find, was not in me before: the Binger Loch, and the Gewissf,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bingerloch is a section of the Rhine nr.

D<hi rend="italic">o</hi> the Wartburg and all Luther&#x2019;s localities.

The Gothic church of St. Elisabeth was built over her grave in Marburg. Philipp (<date when="1504">1504</date>&#x2013;<date when="1567">67</date>), marquess of Hesse, was one of the main defenders of Protestantism.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Here is another Canada Letter, of which there was perhaps notice in the one you got already: a Letter from Sandy&#x2019;s poor little <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi>, who is grown a big Jane now, and Mother of a Son, and writes in an ornamental manner, almost like a printed book: very strange to see! Such are the common products of <hi rend="small-caps">Time</hi>, which we, old people, have to witness, always in greater emphasis, the older we grow.&#x2014; There are also some Scotsbrig and Moffat Note, the latest came to me last night; which are of a comfortable kind, and give us good accounts of our brave old Mother, and her strugglings in the uncertain elements and circumstances. Good old woman!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have got Spring weather here; and are rubbing along in the old fashion,&#x2014;&#x201C;work&#x201C; still a very unsuccessful thing with me, in spite of my attempts that way. As usual I feel that I have got into radically bad ground; that I am like to be <foreign><hi rend="italic">laired</hi></foreign>, and sunk <hi rend="italic">deeper</hi> than the chin;&#x2014;that in fact I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> &#x201C;<foreign>laired</foreign>,&#x201C; and, unless I <foreign><hi rend="italic">sprattle</hi></foreign> dreadfully, shall never be more heard of! Fritz (Frederick) with his &#x201C;crook-stick&#x201C; (a thing he sometimes <hi rend="italic">struck</hi> with),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:1.</note> with his hawk-eyes, military cocked-hat, and crowd of dumb stiff and dark people round him, continues very unmanageable indeed. Some way or other I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> by and by get him off my hands; that is all I can say.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane is pretty well; has been out this bright mild day; and is now come in. She is somewhat concerned with <pb id="pg-28-80" n="28:80"/><hi rend="italic">Talbot</hi>-type Portraits,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The photographic process of making multiple &#x201C;positive&#x201C; prints from a &#x201C;negative,&#x201C; devised by William Henry Fox Talbot (<date when="1800">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877">1877</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26946"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).</note> for which Anthony Sterling has an apparatus at present; I think she will by and by send you a specimen of the strange work he does in that way: portraits <hi rend="italic">ugly</hi> to a degree, but recognisably <hi rend="italic">like</hi>.</p>
<p>I have never yet seen Brown again: indeed about a fortnight ago, I met an Edinburgh-English &#x201C;Mrs Crowe,&#x201C; a great friend of his, who told me not to go at present, or till she warned me, Brown being very weak and unable to talk; and of her or her warnings I have heard no more. Aird&#x2019;s message, the demand for a letter to Aird, I expressly sent by this Dame Crowe, who knows Aird too: Brown&#x2019;s Address is &#x201C;5. St James&#x2019;s Square, Notting Hill, London&#x201C;; no doubt a Letter <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Aird would be right welcome there in the meanwhile. Poor Brown, it appears, is radically <hi rend="italic">dyspeptic</hi> (like some others of us), and feels very weak and oppressed; doubtless too his imagination is lamed and overclouded,&#x2014;and from Mrs C.&#x2019;s description, I figured to myself that perhaps his own medical notions were confusing him, and that he was in worse spirits than the reality warranted. Poor soul, I doubt he has come to a bad harbour here: but on the whole, what <hi rend="italic">good</hi> one is there for the like of him? He too must <foreign><hi rend="italic">dree his wierd</hi></foreign>, with that sad accompaniment of <hi rend="italic">bad liver</hi>, it would appear; and neither in England or Scotland, in Town or in Country is there any way of flogging a man with that whip so as to please him. &#x201C;Strike high? Strike low? The Devil burn it, there&#x2019;s no <foreign><hi rend="italic">plasing</hi></foreign> of you, strike where one will!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>I rejoice still every muddy day over my <foreign><hi rend="italic">whaings:</hi></foreign> it is really a pleasure to find any fraction of human work,&#x2014;even the cutting of a <foreign><hi rend="italic">whaing</hi></foreign>,&#x2014;rightly done! Blessed are all good and faithful workmen; accursed are all bad: that really is the practical outcome of all the Law and the Prophets. I grow more and more reverent of whoever can rightly <hi rend="italic">do</hi> what he is appointed to in God&#x2019;s creation, and am less &#x26; less reverent of anybody else. Alas, alas!&#x2014; But I must out while the hours permit.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I believe the Weber Prints are now pretty well settled;&#x2014;the 11 <hi rend="italic">returned</hi> Prints were to be sent off <foreign><hi rend="italic">franco</hi></foreign> [postage free] yesterday from 34. Regent Street; and the Lady (who <hi rend="italic">would</hi> take no help in the business) had, some days before, written off to Weber, announcing that those said 11 were on the way back to him; and that for the <hi rend="italic">accepted 21</hi> her Ladyship&#x2019;s computation was so many &#xa3; S. D.&#x2014;which, so soon as M. Weber answered that it was <hi rend="italic">right</hi> and that the 11 had arrived,&#x2014;should be sent him in the way indicated. I hope it is <hi rend="italic">now</hi> all right!&#x2014; If however the Bath House servant have forgotten to <hi rend="italic">frank</hi> the Prints (which a Print-seller in the Haymarket was appointed to pack properly), you can let M. Weber understand that such mistake was accidental only, and that he can add the sum to the money otherwise to be paid him.&#x2014; The Prints seemed to me very good in general, excellent some of them, and very cheap for most part;&#x2014;M. Weber&#x2019;s procedure, for the rest, gave, as it could not but do, perfect satisfaction. He ought straightway to learn some right mode of conveyance to England (the &#x201C;Post&#x201C; is clearly not it!); he might then find a good deal of business in England.</p>
<p>On the opposite leaf, I have marked three other Prints which Lady A. wants; and which I said Weber was the properest person to seek. N<hi rend="italic">os</hi> 1 &#x26; 3 are the <hi rend="italic">most</hi> wanted; N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2 I have added <foreign><hi rend="italic">meo periculo</hi></foreign> [at my peril] this morning, and will be good for it when it comes. Let there be no <hi rend="italic">Duplicates</hi> sent: Let M. Weber himself do his best at Bonn, and that shall suffice.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>I want the name and Book-title of that magnanim<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; the admirer is unidentified.</note> German admirer of Cromwell, whom Prof<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Abel speaks of:&#x2014;in fact, my neighbour <hi rend="italic">Chorley</hi> wants it. At your <hi rend="italic">convenience</hi>, both this, and the new trio of Prints; not sooner.</p>
<p>You did not come on Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> but I design to have a pilgrimage to Hampstead myself before long. <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p><title><hi rend="italic">Three Prints</hi> (wanted)</title></p>
<p>1. &#x201C;Fredericus Magnus Rex Borussiac; Georg Friedrich Schmidt sculptor regius sculpsit: Berolini, <date when="1746">1746</date>.&#x201C; This Engraving of the Picture by <hi rend="italic">Antoine Pesne</hi> is recommended as the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bei weitem sch&#xF6;nste und wahrste Bild von</hi> Friedrich,&#x201C; by <hi rend="small-caps">preuss</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Lebensgeschichte</hi>, I.77 n.).<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A print of &#x201C;Frederick the Great King of Prussia,&#x201C; engraved by Georg Friedrich Schmidt (<date when="1712">1712</date>&#x2013;<date when="1775">75</date>), engraver to the king, from Pesne&#x2019;s portrait and presumably printed by Berolini, who is unidentified, recommended by Preuss in his biography of Frederick for its truth and beauty.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; There seems to be <pb id="pg-28-82" n="28:82"/>another Engraving of the same Picture (ibid.) by &#x201C;Joh.

M. Weber can decide this; and let him <hi rend="italic">send</hi> only one (to avoid trouble), the <hi rend="italic">intrinsically best</hi> according to his judgement.</p>
<p>2. Anton Graff&#x2019;s Portrait of Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi>, &#x201C;engraved by <hi rend="italic">Bause</hi> at Leipzig, <date when="1788">1788</date>&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Friedrich Bause (<date when="1738">1738</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814">1814</date>), engraver.</note> (<hi rend="italic">Preuss, Lebensgeschichte</hi>, IV. 314n): if this be the Graff&#x2019;s Picture that is in Schickler&#x2019;s house at Berlin, it must be well worth having. Let M. Weber send it too (t. o.)</p>
<p>3. Look again in Preuss, IV. 241. &#x201C;The famed Engraver Johann Friedrich <hi rend="italic">Clemens</hi> came, in <date when="1787">1787</date>, to Berlin;&#x201C; and there engraved for Print-dealer <hi rend="italic">Pascal</hi>, &#x201C;the large Plate after Joseph Cunningham&#x2019;s Picture,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">F</hi>k <hi rend="italic">the Great&#x2019;s Last Review</hi>.&#x2014; This is especially wanted, if Preuss&#x2019;s account of it be at all correct.&#x2014; &#x2014; (No doubt it was &#x201C;Cunningham&#x2019;s study&#x201C; for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Picture which Rauch shewed us at Berlin as the best Head of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> he could ever get, and the one he had chiefly copied from in his Statue of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> now under the Linden. About Cunningham at all, or about the Picture, except this study of a head &#x201C;from <hi rend="italic">some</hi> picture,&#x201C; Rauch seemed to know nothing.&#x2014; The poor wandering dissolute Cunningham (son of a Scotch Jacobite) whom they call &#x201C;Joseph&#x201C; in Germany, is named &#x201C;Francis Edmund&#x201C; here (died at London, <hi rend="italic">about</hi> <date when="1793">1793</date>), and only Print-dealers still faintly know him.)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Friedrich Clemens (<date when="1749">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831">1831</date>), Danish engraver.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here is an ugly blast of cold wild weather again, which does none of us any good, and which alarms me on your account lest it bring another ill turn on <pb id="pg-28-83" n="28:83"/>you. Since yesternight, or indeed the night before, there has been a bitter northwind; not so cold as formerly, but far too cold for any weak creature; it blows and bites, and dashes snow-powder about from time to time. Yesternight I had a letter from the Doctor, which gave a very welcome account of you: but this temperature is greatly against us all. Keep close in bed, I desire you; and let everybody be careful to keep the room <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> about you,&#x2014;a sufficient fire by <hi rend="italic">night</hi> as well as by day. This I advise, and beg, very much. Cold is the worst thing in the world for you.&#x2014; In a little while this blast will go, and we shall have good weather again. March comes in &#x201C;like a lion&#x201C; (as we see); but goes out &#x201C;like a lamb.&#x201C; Take care, take care!</p>
<p>Poor little Postie, it appears, has fallen into a dangerous predicament;&#x2014;poor little soul, he has been a <foreign><hi rend="italic">bit fell</hi></foreign>, useful, and very obliging creature, this long while; I shall be truly sorry if anything befal him.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I quite forgot to ask you, among other things, if you could have any notion to concern yourself with a new <hi rend="italic">Life of Allan Ramsay</hi> the Scotch Poet, Author of <hi rend="italic">The Gentle Shepherd</hi> &#x26;c?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Allan Ramsay (<date when="1686">1686</date>&#x2013;<date when="1758">1758</date>), Scottish poet, author of the pastoral drama <hi rend="italic">The Gentle Shepherd</hi> (<date when="1725">1725</date>) and other poems; he also ed. and freely revised earlier Scottish poems.</note></p>
<p>A man in Edinburgh, whom I do not know, has written to me twice on the subject,&#x2014;the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> time, a day or two ago, to say that the <hi rend="italic">Work is done:</hi> &#x201C;200 pages&#x201C; of nice <hi rend="italic">Ms.;</hi> which he wishes me to <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, and also to write an &#x201C;Introduction&#x201C; to.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No biography or letters of Ramsay were pbd. in <date when="1853">1853</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854">54</date>, possibly because there were at least two recent edns. with memoirs, <hi rend="italic">Select Poetical Works</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1849">1849</date>), pbd. by William and Robert Chambers, and <hi rend="italic">The Works of Allan Ramsay. With Life of the Author by George Chalmers, and an Essay on his Genius and Writings by Lord Woodhouselee</hi>, 3 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1848">1848</date>; new edns: <date when="1851">1851</date> and <date when="1853">1853</date>).</note> Both of these requests I mean to <hi rend="italic">decline:</hi> but the man, who seems to have diligence, enthusiasm for his task, and other good qualities, and has really tried a thing worth doing, ought to have what help one <hi rend="italic">can</hi> give him. I must own, to judge by his Letters (or last Letter, for I cannot remember the first), he does not promise to be any great witch at composition: but he is perhaps an average, or more, in that respect too; his work is <hi rend="italic">brief</hi>, his subject <hi rend="italic">good</hi> (at least for Scotland, and the scholarly part of England); he professes to give <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> of Ramsay;&#x2014;and has really, I believe, laboured a number of years getting his Book together.&#x2014; The question therefore is Would it probably be worth his while to send you his <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. for your examination and advice upon it? Or would you rather not see it at all?&#x2014;</p>
<p>Please answer me, in one word, <hi rend="italic">just as you feel about it;</hi> for the truth is, I have no interest in the man whatever beyond what I describe; and can finish him off with a <hi rend="italic">general</hi> &#x201C;No,&#x201C; as I have to do so many.</p>
<p>For the rest, Ramsay (Scotch <hi rend="italic">Guarini</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Giovanni Battista Guarini (<date when="1538">1538</date>&#x2013;<date when="1612">1612</date>), Italian poet, best-known for his pastoral tragicomedy <hi rend="italic">Il Pastor Fido</hi> (<date when="1590">1590</date>).</note> and more) is really a considerable man; and a tolerable Life of him is wanted in the world.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am quite ashamed to answer again in the negative; indeed I am. But the truth is, I am below par in health for some months past; and in all states of health, I am sure to be so miserable, and to get so much damage, in any crowded meeting, especially when Dining and Public Speaking are the business,&#x2014;I have really no resource but to avoid all such engagements, however much to my regret otherwise on some occasions.</p>
<p>You will oblige me very much if you will get this Scotch bit of Paper turned into money at your Banker&#x2019;s, and place it to account of the Literary Fund, with my grateful testimonies and best wishes on behalf of that institution. As I said once already, this Institution <hi rend="italic">does</hi>, by such methods as there are, a thing indispensable, and which there is nothing else here to do: it seems to me all Literary Persons in particular, who are not themselves reduced to absolute poverty, are bound to bear witness, in some way, that they at least wish it heartily well.</p>
<p>My Banker being Scotch, yours I believe will have some formality, some <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi> of days I think, to go thro&#x2019;; but no doubt he knows the method; and for myself there is no other course so short.</p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I was very sorry to hear of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">two</hi> o&#x2019;clock&#x201C; for dinner; I am good for nothing at that hour; and cannot well shew myself before 5 in the afternoon,&#x2014;under penalty of <hi rend="italic">losing a day;</hi> which of course I am loathe to do.</p>
<p>I perceive we shall have to put the matter off altogether till my return from The Grange,&#x2014; Monday week;&#x2014;after which, or even on which evening, I shall be ready to see you again, and discuss capabilities. I hope not to be out when you call next.</p>

But the reading of a few papers sufficiently intimates that these &#x2018;Letters&#x2019; never can have gone through a terrestrial Post-office; that they are an after-thought, composed from vague memory and imagination, &#x2026; instead of living words by an eye-witness! Not to be cited &#x2018;freely&#x2019; at all, but sparingly and under conditions. They abound in small errors, in misdates, mistakes; small fictions even, and impossible pretensions:&#x2014;foolish mortal, to write down his bit of knowledge in that form! For the man, in spite of his lace-ruffles and gesticulations, has brisk eyesight of a superficial kind: he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have done us this little service &#x2026;; and he, the lace-ruffles having gone into his soul, has been tempted into misdoing it!&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 14:231&#x2013;32).</note> There will be nothing for it now but actually to <hi rend="italic">begin</hi>,&#x2014;God knows how in the world, or whether ever, to <hi rend="italic">end</hi>.

You shall hear of my return; and see me, I hope, shortly after,&#x2014;within a fortnight of this.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday afternoon I finished off the &#x2019;Bacco Affair. Bolton had got the six Pounds all in one bag, with a <hi rend="italic">C</hi>n <hi rend="italic">&#x26; Rippon</hi> red label pasted on it; the great Tobacconists had not been able to make it up in quarters in less time than 48 hours: wherefore I explained to Bolton that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> must do that service,&#x2014;wrap it, namely, into 24 quarters; and also take 8 of the said quarters, and give them a new cover separate from the 16. He undertook everything; a stupid but faithful-looking man: I paid his account; and took his solemn (i.e. shopkeeper) promise to have the Parcel, with your Address on it (the very paper-cliping you <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> was to be pasted on), at Euston Square H&#xF4;tel &#x201C;tomorrow&#x201C; (this Thursday) &#x201C;morning&#x201C;; where I have no doubt it now is.&#x2014;&#x2014; For what of the &#x2019;Bacco belongs to yourself here inclosed is the account: my Mother&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-28-89" n="28:89"/>portion I wish to have the satisfaction of buying for her; having often attempted similar feats, and, in a majority of instances, <hi rend="italic">failed</hi> for some reason.</p>
<p>We have bitter weather here; which doubtless corrugates and afflicts the <hi rend="italic">skin</hi>, afflicts consequently the liver (and alas the &#x201C;lights [lungs]&#x201C; also!) and makes one very uncomfortable.&#x2014; I think daily with anxiety, How my poor old Mother is to stand it?</p>
<p>On Saturday I go to the Grange,&#x2014;to stay till Monday-week: Jane, in these catarrhal circumstances, backs out. I come home punctually on the Monday; but expect to hear from you there. A certain Azeglio, Turinese, Minister, Painter or I know not what is to be Hero:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Massimo Taparelli d&#x2019;Azeglio from Turin was a novelist and painter as well as a politician.</note> alas, <foreign><hi rend="italic">io non certo nessuno</hi></foreign> [I am certainly a nobody]!&#x2014;<closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T.

<dateline><place>The Grange</place>, <date when="1853-03-27">27 March / 1853</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>My dear little Jeannie,&#x2014;</salute>I got hither yesterday without accident; very cold, at least too much so (for the carriage had 4 in it and I had to keep down <pb id="pg-28-90" n="28:90"/>the window), but otherwise fortunate, and above all, <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, for till the arrival at Andover Road I had not spoken one word. I read in <hi rend="italic">Larpent</hi>, or looked out upon the quiet fields with the spring sun resting on them, and thought (in a sad enough mood) about many things. At Andover Road Station the carriage was drawn up with George (do they call him?) on the box; and a certain grave-looking young gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">I</hi> evidently but <hi rend="italic">another</hi>, was just about getting in! On inquiry this turned out to be &#x201C;Dr Hofmann,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >August Wilhelm Hofmann (<date when="1818">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892">92</date>), German pioneer organic chemist; asst. at Giessen to Justus von Liebig (<date when="1803">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873">73</date>), chemist and biochemist who synthesized chloroform; first prof. and superintendent of the new Royal College of Chemistry in London, <date when="1845">1845</date>; chemist to the royal mint, <date when="1856">1856</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865">65</date>; prof. of chemistry at Berlin Univ., <date when="1865">1865</date>.</note> the learned Liebig-Chemistry Professor, who was also to be a guest here: a very sensible well-instructed and serious-minded person, with whom I did very well in the vehicle (tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> did not smoke) and have done ever since. A quite superior kind of man; tho&#x2019; his strong-side, Chemistry, is out of my way. I find it has been with a view to <hi rend="italic">absorb</hi> and neutralise this one that I am here before Monday, when the other guests come. He helped us last night to a more rational evening than is quite common in such cases.&#x2014; In the hubbub of getting in, however, tho&#x2019; I <hi rend="italic">stated</hi> plainly what my luggage was, I did not see it on with my own eyes; the consequence of which was, my portmanteau was not forthcoming when we arrived here; and another vehicle had to go for it, I <hi rend="italic">dining</hi> in my shag waistcoat &#x26;c, till the indispensable package came to hand,&#x2014;all safe as need be, before dinner was done.</p>
<p>Furthermore, dear Goody, I have brought no <hi rend="italic">pills</hi>, woe&#x2019;s me! Go up to my dressing-closet, like a good wise <foreign><hi rend="italic">bairn</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in the glass-drawer to your right hand, there is a box (among several <hi rend="italic">empty</hi> one<supplied>[s]</supplied>)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> with pills of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> old kind in it: send me <hi rend="italic">three</hi>, wrapt in a little crumb of paper; they will go into the cover of your Letter, and be a grateful blessing here! Do not forget; oh no, you will not forget!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I slept very badly last night, indeed hardly any right sound sleep at all, only an obstinate half-desperate lying still and dozing: I do not feel <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> today, but there is a considerable dose of cold about me still, and I am thrown out of my old ruts, and in a <hi rend="italic">dazed</hi> kind of condition. Lord A. too has plenty of cold; and never minds. Lady A. regretted &#x26;c your not coming: but on the whole you were wiser. The air is clear, everything still as death, &#x26; clean and dry all round: but except when the sun is out (which happens only by fits) it is very cold. I am for a long walk today; and hope to be a little hardened to my new element against tomorrow. Oh <hi rend="italic">whow!</hi> Oh whow! I think I too should be better at home!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Give my respects to Nero, and a crumb of sugar. Take care <pb id="pg-28-91" n="28:91"/>of thy poor little self, and be well and good when I come back. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear little woman (after all)!</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Jeannie,</salute>
<p>We are now about the middle of our visit here, or rather farther; but there is really nothing to be written about,&#x2014;and for the rest, no <hi rend="italic">pen</hi>, no time or no anything to write that in! Yesterday I retired upstairs in the afternoon with a determination for &#x201C;deliberate writing&#x201C;; but it was too cold, I was too tired; on the whole, I lay down on two chairs, and fell asleep,&#x2014;which probably was better after all.</p>
<p>Our Italian figures came at the due time (a few minutes after I had done writing last time); and they are now gone again, this <hi rend="italic">noon</hi>, and we are merely British Subjects, with nothing but English to speak, instead of those unhappy jargons. Azeglio the younger, with shining big China face and glossy whiskers, you have seen, &#x26; I suppose <hi rend="italic">not</hi> admired; his Uncle Azeglio the Elder is a much wiser-looking man, much leaner at any rate and sadder,&#x2014;sternly sorrowful hawk-visage with large sad affectionate unhealthy eyes (the white of them all <hi rend="italic">grey-yellow</hi>); a man I rather liked, but did not get much good of, owing to our different dialects and different ways of thinking;&#x2014;nay I had like to have got into quarrel with him the first night, on the subject of <hi rend="italic">Mazzini</hi>, having rashly attempted to rectify his wild notion he was expressing on that subject. It was in the Drawing room directly after dinner, Lady Ashburton presiding; but I made <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than nothing of it; for at the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> pass I said (finding Azeglio <hi rend="italic">too</hi> bad in his utterances ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> M.), &#x201C;Monsieur, vous ne le conoissez pas du tout, du tout&#x201C;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Sir, you do not know him at all, not at all.&#x201C; Mazzini had written to a friend in London, <date when="1853-02-11">11 Feb.</date>, that he feared he would have by his side continuously the phantom of Azeglio &#x201C;with long long daggers threatening me&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Scritti</hi> 48:253&#x2013;54) and to an English friend, <date when="1853-05-11">11 May</date>: &#x201C;I am glad that Carlyle took my part against Azeglio. Azeglio is, or rather has been, a very clever man, a good novel writer, and a far better landscape painter: narrow in his political conceptions, narrow in his love for his country, which amounts to a little feeling of pride and nothing else; despising the people: sensuous in his life; a sceptic in everything, from woman to religion, a true emanation of the XVIII century&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Scritti</hi> 49:189).</note> and turned abruptly away, and sat down to a Newspaper <pb id="pg-28-93" n="28:93"/>out of earshot. However, we did better afterwards; and I really rather liked the much-suffering man, who, carries yet in his knee a bullet he got in the Battle of Novaro (for which he blames Mazzini, I suppose).<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Novara (which TC spells with final &#x201C;o&#x201C;), 27 mi. W of Milan, where the Austrians beat the Piedmontese army, <date when="1849-03-23">23 March 1849</date>.</note>&#x2014; We had also a Portuguese Ambassador, of quick rather Jewish aspect, very fond of talking (bad French), with a wise enough little <foreign>gleg</foreign> brown Wife:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francisco de Assis de Almeida (<date when="1796">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870">1870</date>), 2nd Count Lavardio, envoy from Portugal from <date when="1851">1851</date>, m. to Joaquina Jos&#xE9; de Melo (d. <date when="1858">1858</date>).</note> but they are all gone, all&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Dieu merci</hi></foreign>,&#x2014;and I wish rather I too were gone; for (incredible as it may seem) I am but unhappy here; and cannot <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> or get a word of sense talked to me except by accident, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> does not suit at all.&#x2014; But enough, enough, there is a noise here, enough to drown all sense in any mortal, and there is a cry of <hi rend="italic">tea</hi> come (Venables &#x26; I very <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> with riding): tomorrow I mean again to <hi rend="italic">try</hi> writing a word, but don&#x2019;t be surprised if I still cannot get it done! <closer><salute>God bless you.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I think you knew I was to come hither for a week of Country visiting: here accordingly I am since saturday last; and am to stay till monday; on which day the business ends.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC writes on Fri.</note> I know not how it can well &#x201C;do much for me&#x201C;, this little excursion; but it was not to be well avoided, and at lowest I get some half-dozen pleasant <hi rend="italic">rides</hi> out of it, and the sight of the clean fields and bright skies is itself something after a long doze of town. Jane wrote to me this morning; gives a tolerably fair account of her health and other affairs: she was not &#x201C;well <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>&#x201C; for the expedition in general, or at least thought she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be <hi rend="italic">better</hi> at <pb id="pg-28-95" n="28:95"/>home. Two Notes have come from Jack about <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, moreover, which were a great comfort to me; during the harsh frosty winds I was always in some alarm lest you got some mischief of them: but now, since last night, the wind has got round to the west; and the sun is shining, tho&#x2019; with showers, and we have almost a summer temperature. There was much need of it: there is not yet the slightest vestige of spring, or green of any kind, upon the fields; not even a primrose to be seen, for they were out long since, and killed again: nothing but a few rather sickly <hi rend="italic">gowans</hi>, to be met with here and there, announces what season we are in; it is the latest spring remembered here for a long time.</p>
<p>Our Party was never very numerous; and now consists only of four and myself, besides the natural inhabitants: we had till yesterday four others, Italian, Portuguese &#x26;c dignitaries, who could speak nothing but French, and were rather a burden in that way to the native part of us. They are now gone; &#x26; tomorrow (Saturday) all the others go, except myself and a Lady-friend of Jane&#x2019;s and mine (a Miss Farrar, a very good soul) whom I am to take charge of homeward on Monday. My rides and my walks, and solitary <hi rend="italic">smokings</hi> and meditations in the woods &#x26; thickets of this huge <foreign><hi rend="italic">braw</hi></foreign> &#x201C;Park&#x201C; (a place about 3 miles in diameter) are my chief recreations here.</p>
<p>Last night while we sat quietly at dinner, a slip of paper was handed in by one of the servants to Lord A<hi rend="italic">n:</hi> &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> visible somewhere in the neighbourhood.&#x201C; I admired much the silent promptitude with which Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, telling nobody, went out, leaving his dinner in the middle; drew on boots &#x26; cloak (as we found afterwards), and galloped off with a groom, in the wild squally night, which soon became plunges of rain. This is what an English country gentleman is always good for; this and the like of this,&#x2014;if he is of right quality. The fire proved to be six miles off,&#x2014;one of the Grange Farmers of this Estate, his <hi rend="italic">onstead</hi> all ablaze; cattle &#x26;c saved,&#x2014;Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> came back about 11 p.m., wet enough, but one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have said almost <hi rend="italic">glad</hi>, tho&#x2019; to him also it will be a considerable loss, no doubt.&#x2014; &#x2014; My paper ends here, dear Mother; and it is not worth while continuing in this strain thro&#x2019; another sheet. I will write soon from my own table at Chelsea. <closer><salute>Love to Jamie &#x26; Isabella; and blessings on you all.</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your two Notes have duly reached me: the first came to Chelsea after my departure, and followed me hither, the second arriving along with it: I was <pb id="pg-28-96" n="28:96"/>very glad indeed to hear of our Mother&#x2019;s holding out so well, for the weather, tho&#x2019; bright enough, has been very cold in these parts. We had, for the first time, last night, a violent convulsion of storm and rain indicating that the wind was getting round to the West, where it now is, and where may it long remain. It will do us all good to get out of those fierce Northern influences; my very hands are chapped and cracked by them.</p>
<p>I got here, according to program, on Saturday; there arrived along with me a Dr Hofmann; Liebig-Chemistry Professor, a very honest soft intelligent and modest Giessen specimen, who staid only till Tuesday, before which time other English specimens (Venables, Ellice, Poodle-Byng &#x26;c) had arrived, who still continue for another day: on the evening of the same Tuesday came four <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> personages, Portuguese Ambassador &#x201C;Lavardio&#x201C; and his Wife; two Turin Azeglios, Nephew and Uncle (Ex-minister), which latter, a kind of lion at present in these parts, was specifically the hero of this rustic party of ours. Not very much of a hero, I think, but intrinsically an amiable worthy kind of man. He is tall, lean, of acquiline stooping figure, long acquiline nose and big heavyladen grey eyes, the <hi rend="italic">whites</hi> of which, excessively large, are grey-yellow: a dyspeptic, melancholy Ex-minister; carries still a bullet in his knee, caught at the Battle of Novara, &#x26; has a great terror of Austria and Mazzini. Speaks nothing but French; eats infinite sugar, with or without <foreign><hi rend="italic">boulets de gomme</hi></foreign> [gum balls] from the waistcoat pocket, and smokes daily about 20 paper cigarettes. We had some difficulty in agreeing at first; but got on very well after the preliminaries were settled. His Nephew, Turin Ambassador, is a flaring big man of no visible parts or faculty except that <supplied>[of]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> eating &#x26;c; like a figure painted on a teaboard, so fluid and foolish-looking is he. The Portuguese Ambassador, a talking <foreign><hi rend="italic">gleg</hi></foreign>man, puzzled me by his look all the time; at length I discovered he had the very face of one <hi rend="italic">Tommy Muir</hi>, a venerable Pedlar whom I recollect at the Ecclefechan fairs out of very old times! H<supplied>[is]</supplied> Wife was a nice little black <hi rend="italic">jenny spin<supplied>[ner]</supplied></hi> of a body.&#x2014; They all went off yesterday; and nothing but English is now needed: a great relief to some of us. The rest, except Miss Farrar and I, go tomorrow; Miss F. and I are to go together on Monday; and so the business will happily end. A very idle business; yields me a <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> each day, &#x26; very little else that is of much use or pleasure. Today they are shooting fowl on the Lake; bang, bang, I hear the guns go; Ellice talks within doors about Thiers and the Russian question:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thiers had written to Ellice, <date when="1853-03-25">25</date> and <date when="1853-03-28">28 March</date>, about the threat to French and British interests of Russian ambitions to drive west and south (D. Hal&#xE9;vy ed., <hi rend="italic">Le Courrier de M. Thiers</hi> [Paris, <date when="1921-03">1921</date>] 306&#x2013;14). A dispute between Russia and France over rights in Ottoman Turkey had led to an ultimatum from Russia to Turkey in <date when="1853-03">March</date>, followed by its occupation of the Ottoman Danubian provinces (modern Romania). Aberdeen&#x2019;s ministry was ready to be conciliatory to Russia, but further events and public opinion were to force it to change policy and, in <date when="1854-03">1854</date>, led to the Crimean War. Thiers was confident of France&#x2019;s and Britain&#x2019;s joint power to further their own interests, and even warned that they should be prepared for an eventual alliance of Russia and the U.S. against them before the end of the century.</note> last <pb id="pg-28-97" n="28:97"/>night at dinner Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> got notice that there was a <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> visible in the neighbourhood; silently he glided out, galloped off; &#x201C;a farm burnt out, 6 miles off,&#x201C;&#x2014;one of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> farms,&#x2014;was the report at 11.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Love to Phoebe; <foreign>adieu</foreign> to both.

<p><salute>Thanks for your nice little Letter;</salute> even with nothing to tell but the flight of the Cat, you can make a very pretty story; and beat most of us &#x201C;for a deep thought.&#x201C; In my greed I hope farther I may get another Notekin tomorrow morning,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; that is rather uncertain hoping:&#x2014;but otherwise I shall hear no more of you till I come home.</p>
<p>I could hardly get my big packet read at all this morning: the man George was too late in calling me, and I had fallen again into a dead sleep, which might have lasted till noon, had he let me alone: the consequence was, bells began wringing<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> before I was out of the bath; and so, tho&#x2019; very cold, I had to run direct down to breakfast, to eat in a frozen stupified manner, hardly knowing what; and the ill effects cleave to me all day, hardly to be remedied by the strictest fasting for the time that yet is. &#x201C;Indigestion&#x201C; fatal maid, she, let me do as I will, is my steady companion in these localities.&#x2014; I wandered up to the little mosshouse with my letters lately, and there got them read a second time, with all deliberation at last. The Mackenzie letter is really something curious for me;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530313-TC-JAMA-01">TC to <sic>JM</sic><corr>JAMA</corr>, <date when="1853-03-13">13 March</date></ref>.</note> the Parker I could have wished rather <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to see just now,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reply to TC to J. W. Parker, <date when="1853-03-20">20 March</date>.</note> for there is another to a fool in Edinburgh which I must write in consequence of it, and I have not the address till I get home. Dilberoglue&#x2019;s strangle<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; perhaps for &#x201C;strange.&#x201C;</note> little missive struck Miss Farrar with its hieroglyphs at breakfast; and I had to shew it to her and Lady A<hi rend="italic">n:</hi> but they neither made much out of it, I guess.</p>
<p>We had a tempestuous loud-howling night of it, last night; my chimney smoking &#x26;c upstairs: but there is, as was to be expected, a much softened <pb id="pg-28-98" n="28:98"/>temperature today, and beautiful grey west-wind copiously blowing. All the <hi rend="italic">active</hi> world has been out shooting waterfowl on the Lake; and have just ended, and gone <hi rend="italic">from</hi> luncheon again, while I was out on the hill; nobody here but a silent Venables just now;&#x2014;and I am to have my <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> pony in a little while, which will answer quite as well for me today.</p>
<p>Reichenbach&#x2019;s transaction with that Silesian <hi rend="italic">Sutor</hi> was very noble on his part, but is sad to think of; for the little weazel of a creature must have cheated us <hi rend="italic">both</hi>. There is nothing more certain than that these <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the same pair of shoes, with the greater part o<supplied>[f]</supplied> them cut away to <hi rend="italic">stockings;</hi> for my part I should much prefer to have them in their <hi rend="italic">original</hi> state, were that now conceivable. Anyway I want to see no more of the man, and he had better stay by his <hi rend="italic">awls</hi> on monday night.</p>
<p>Tomorrow our three &#x201C;established men&#x201C; go, and nothing will remain but Miss Farrar and I: on Monday I am to &#x201C;take care of Miss Farrar&#x201C;;&#x2014;I fancy about 5 o&#x2019;clock will be the time for dining me that day, if all go well.</p>
<p>We had Trench last night, very fat and happy;&#x2014;Venables &#x26; he unite in much (to me incredible) praise of <hi rend="italic">Preciosa</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Palgrave&#x2019;s novel.</note> to which Lady A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> sometimes answer<supplied>[s]</supplied><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> that you describe it as by a &#x201C;female Helps.&#x201C; The <hi rend="italic">Vaudreuil</hi> Book was in the <hi rend="italic">burning Carriage</hi> during last year&#x2019;s German trip; and a scorched copy of it was produced on your recommendation being mentioned.</p>
<p>Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> did a bright act of Country-gentlemanship last night: alarm of fire in the distance was given in (on a slip of paper) at dinner; Lord <hi rend="italic">An</hi> silently withdrew, flung on a cloak, galloped out thro&#x2019; storm and darkness which soon became torrents of rain; some six miles off, one of his own farmers; and we saw no more of him till towards eleven. Farmer quite burnt out of house; cattle saved, no crop <hi rend="italic">to</hi> save: insured or not? don&#x2019;t know.&#x2014; &#x2014;<closer><salute>Here is the pony, I must off. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dearest.</salute></closer></p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">5 p.m</hi>. Returned from a solitary ride of two hours, very cold-<hi rend="italic">fingered</hi>, having had showers and no gloves on hand; but not cold otherwise, and considerably improved by my windy locomotion.&#x2014;&#x201C;Tea is come&#x201C; too; so that, under pain of slops, I must cease.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> then, Jeannie dear. Till Monday, if we prosper.&#x2014;My regards to Nero &#x26; the unsettled Cat.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have read your little Pamphlet,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Endowed Parish Schools and High Church Vicars. Roan&#x2019;s School, Past, Present, and Future. Three Letters to the Parishioners of Greenwich</hi> (Greenwich, <date when="1853">1853</date>). Roan&#x2019;s Charity School had been founded in the <date>17th cent.</date> for local education with funds provided by John Roan. The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1853-06-25">25 June</date>, noted the school&#x2019;s &#x201C;inefficiency&#x201C; and its being &#x201C;converted to purposes quite foreign to those of the donor. The ignorance of the children after leaving the school, if the replies to a great number of questions put by Mr. Bennett may be taken as a fair sample of their scholastic attainments, approaches the verge of the incredible. The funds appear to be abused, &#x2026; the trustees rendering no public account. &#x2026; What is worst of all, Roan&#x2019;s bounty is prostituted to sectarian purposes. The founder of the school kept himself clear of religious differences.&#x201C; Nothing in law made &#x201C;Church baptism a condition of admittance,&#x201C; so why was it required by the trustees.</note>&#x2014;with pleasure, so far as you are concerned. You seem to have been engaged in an arduous, disagreeable, yet indispensable duty; and to have managed your pleading with great clearness, circumspectness, and the eloquence which honest zeal inspires. Your specimen scholar from the Roan&#x2019;s School is a marvellous article!&#x2014; I hope you will completely achieve the reform of that scandalous mismanagement, to the benefit of this and future generations; and cannot but wish there were such a preacher in every locality where such an abuse insults mankind,&#x2014;a rather frequent case, I believe, in poor England just now.</p>
<p>Such work, I continue to think, is much more melodiously &#x201C;poetical&#x201C; for a human soul than the best-written verses are.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here is a little Package, which is intrinsically worth nothing, but which will be welcome to you nevertheless. One of the inventions of these times, that of taking Portraits by the light of the sun, is no doubt common in your neighbourhood as it is in ours: a particular form of it, called <hi rend="italic">Talbotype</hi>, has lately come into the hands of the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> public here; and one of our acquaintances (Anthony Sterling, a man rich and idle) amuses himself, as various people do, <pb id="pg-28-100" n="28:100"/>with taking likenesses by that method. Here are two of his best specimens; at least the two which, I am well sure, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will like <hi rend="italic">best</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Captain Anthony Sterling&#x2019;s Photograph Album and His Relations with Jane Carlyle,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Newsletter</hi>, 6 (<date when="1985">1985</date>): 42&#x2013;50.</note> Mine was not originally done by him, but has been copied successfully by him, as you here see: Jane&#x2019;s I do not think nearly so good; but it also is a tolerable Likeness, and of course faithful so far as it goes. You can keep the poor scraps, if they come safe to, under some kind of cheap frame, or safe anywhere from <hi rend="italic">dust</hi> and <hi rend="italic">damp</hi> (these are the two elements hostile to them); and now and then they will give you remembrances of those by whom you never can be forgotten, and who otherwise do not fear that you ever will forget them. Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are in our usual health here, which is not of the most vigorous description, and in the usual situation of affairs,&#x2014;rather stationary and contemplative amid the huge whirlpool of noise, and mostly aimless locomotion, and mostly vain activity, which surrounds us. I am not writing anything, at least not anything that will <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> on the paper: but I try to be not quite idle, to struggle at least towards work, if I cannot yet get into it; and to possess my soul in what patience I can. For the rest I find we have never yet got <hi rend="italic">properly</hi> out of our &#x201C;House-repair,&#x201C; or fairly settled in the old routine again. So thinskinned and helpless is a poor &#x201C;speculative&#x201C; creature; unacquainted with the world&#x2019;s industries, and abhorrent of many of its habits and ways!

I believe truly it has cost more than twice as much money, and perhaps five times as much time and bother, as you, had you been here on the spot, would have brought us thro&#x2019; it for.&#x2014; However, I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> (tho&#x2019; unpapered and unpainted as yet) an excellent large wholesome room to sit in (19 feet by 18 or more); also a pleasant wholesome bedroom and dressing-closet, <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> as the country itself, and extremely <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> for London: I ought to be thankful &#x26; content; and shall be so, were my nerves quite healed to their old pitch again.

All is &#x201C;prosperity, &#x201C; too, they say continually; that is, <hi rend="italic">money</hi> is plentiful and makes luxury and folly, in all classes, still more plentiful: truly, the &#x201C;prosperity&#x201C; we are now in, and the <pb id="pg-28-101" n="28:101"/>paths we are now travelling as with the speed of express-trains,&#x2014; give rise to meditations enough in me.&#x2014; &#x2014; In your last Letter to Graham of Burnswark, I noticed, you talk of &#x201C;eyesight&#x201C;: did I ever tell you that I too use spectacles at night, for a year or two past; and feel myself indeed growing very old.

<p>Our dear old Mother is still holding wonderfully together; and I have good report of her not yet a week old; our dreadful spring weather (one of the fiercest and latest springs I ever saw) did give her a shock once which alarmed us for a day or two; but it soon passed again, and she seems as well as before.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Take this small Note from me rather than none at all. I came home from The Grange, according to program, on Monday, without accident or adventure of any kind; I had got your Letter there: I was heartily wearied with the idle tumult we had had, and the total absence of solid employment or rationality which had characterised my existence for the week past:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Was at The Grange for a week;&#x2014;worse than useless to me: a long nightmare; <hi rend="italic">folly</hi> and <hi rend="italic">indigestion</hi> the order of the day. Why go thither? Really it neither does nor can do me any good, to frequent that much-coveted kind of society;&#x2014;or alas any &#x2018;kind&#x2019;; I believe there is no lonelier mortal on the face of this Earth at present nor perhaps often was. Don&#x2019;t be a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kopfh&#xE4;nger</hi></foreign> [someone who hangs his head], however; no! <hi rend="italic">Use</hi> solitude, since it is thy lot; that also is a lot, and really a rather original one in these days. Has its advantages too. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Voyons</hi></foreign> [Let us see]&#x2014; &#x2026; / The <hi rend="italic">Review, Newspaper</hi> world &#x26;c all dead against me at present; which is instructive too, if I take the right point of survey for it, and look into it without jaundice of any kind. &#x2026; Withal it is rather curious to remark also &#x2026; how while all the talk and print goes against me, my real estimation in the world &#x2026; seems steadily increasing,&#x2014;steadily in various quarters, and surely <hi rend="italic">fast</hi> enough, if not too fast. Be true to thyself; O Heavens, be not a sluggard;&#x2014;and so give up <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, and take to something like work, this blessed morning&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1853-04-13">13 April</date>).</note>&#x2014;I have never <pb id="pg-28-102" n="28:102"/>yet got quite anchored down into my old moorings here; and, tho&#x2019; apparently <hi rend="italic">busy</hi> all day, am really not <hi rend="italic">working</hi> since my return, except as a living soul, in whom reason is not extinct tho&#x2019; buried in the belly of Chaos, may be said to <hi rend="italic">work</hi>. God send me &#x201C;a good deliverance&#x201C; (as the serjeant-at-arms says)!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Parliament.</note> For there is little daylight yet visible thro&#x2019; my affairs; and the heart of me has not the violent strength it once had to tumble the dung-mountains out of my way, to right and left!&#x2014; I have done nothing at <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi> since my return; have not, in fact, put pen to paper at all. The truth is, I am very <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi> in addition to all; and must try to acquire a little more composure of nerves, and healthy thickness of skin, as the beginning of all possibility of good.</p>
<p>We have now the finest weather; bright sunny skies, with the due proportion of <date when="1853-04">April</date> showers; and the trees, after this long delay, are at last fairly beginning to bud. There was not in Hampshire the slightest incipiency of green tint to be met with; the greenest field I had seen was St James&#x2019;s Park on my return.&#x2014; The other night we had Henry Inglis here; grown fat and five-and-forty, otherwise much the same man;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Inglis (<date when="1806">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885">85</date>; corrected dates; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271129-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:290</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1827-11-29">29 Nov. 1827</date></corr></ref>), senior partner in H. &#x26; W.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>On Monday I got safe home from the Grange; as perhaps you would infer from the Newspapers which came addressed in my hand the next day. Jane had left them all for that purpose. I have since sent a Package of Books or Pamphlets by the post: the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> Pamphlet (about &#x201C;Galvanism&#x201C; &#x26; &#x201C;Illumination&#x201C;)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> you may give to James Aitken if there is opportunity; otherwise light the fire with it; for indeed it is not of much consequence to anybody.&#x2014; Jane is stirring about, and indeed out walking at this hour: our weather is now quite spring-like; but I think it has not much improved either her or me;&#x2014;probably we are but yet in the <hi rend="italic">transition</hi> state, and not <foreign><hi rend="italic">hefted</hi></foreign> to our new element. I myself was considerably shaken wrong by the strange new element of life which The Grange always offers: dinner about 8 in the evening, and a continued series of elegant <hi rend="italic">idlenesses</hi> thro the waking hours of the 24, this does not tend much to edify me at all; and a week of it, all on the sudden, does not even operate upon me as <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> but only as surprise and confusion.&#x2014; On the saturday before leaving, I rode with Lord Ashburton to the scene of the <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> I had spoken of, some five miles off us: a scene of utter ruin, all <hi rend="italic">black</hi>, with ruins of iron farm-tools, grubbers, ploughs &#x26;c, and the dung-hills, and ground about, still smoking and hot. Only 2 wheat ricks were saved,&#x2014;about &#xa3;2,000 of damage done: the farmer was insured and will lose nothing; Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> was not, and must build the <hi rend="italic">onstead</hi> anew, which will be &#xa3;1000 or so out of his way, as he told me, in the most goodnatured humour. I advised him to move the new stackyard farther off the house, for one thing; not close upon it, or even close <hi rend="italic">in front</hi> of it, as is the fashion here; which suggestion he approved of. The mischief was cause<supplied>[d]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> by the kitchen-chimney taking fire: in the brisk wind the sparks were thrown upon the ricks, and everything was dry as tinder; had it been one <hi rend="italic">half hour later</hi>, when plenty of rain began falling and pouring, no mischief had been done.&#x2014; &#x2014; All things looked exceedingly backward in Hampshire; and neither on watermeadow nor elsewhere could one notice any hue of green. Things have budded out, however, in this past week; and now we are going to have real grass and leaves.</p>
<p>Jane got a little welcome Note from Isabella and I had one from John while at The Grange: we have had no later word about you, dear Mother, and now begin to wish for something farther. For there is no satisfying of us! This improved weather will surely do something for us all, were we once fairly <pb id="pg-28-104" n="28:104"/>thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">the change</hi>. Meanwhile I can only advise, as always, Care and Caution; &#x26; not to be rash about going over the threshold, except when sunshine is out and the wind low. I fancy with myself a little expedition to the <hi rend="italic">Fairy Brae <foreign>Yett</foreign></hi> might do my dear old Mother good, when she is able for it! The Earth and the Sky are again beautiful with God&#x2019;s Mercies made visible to our eyes: might we understand that <hi rend="italic">He</hi> will never forsake them that trust in Him; and that in the Immensities and the Eternities, He verily (much as our poor weak heart practically doubts it often) is alone King and Lord! Amen, Amen.</p>
<p>My dear Mother, I must add no more just now; having in fact many things to do in proportion to the time left. I wrote yesterday to Sandy; sending him a couple of those little Portraits, one of Jane (not very good), one of myself the same as you saw. I intend to have a Copy of your Picture here taken in that way; and to send it to him by and by; another for Jenny too perhaps.&#x2014; &#x2014; The Town is getting very full of grand people; but we keep clear out of their way hitherto. <closer><salute>My love to Jamie and Isabella; God&#x2019;s blessing on you and them all, Mother ever dear. Your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p>I came home a week ago; but have been rather weakly, and very busy (alas, with little!) ever since.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>When I stated, on a public occasion, some year or two ago that I had not found it possible to get any private room or quiet convenient corner, for reading and studying in, at the British Museum,&#x2014;there followed, if rumour did not mislead me, some contradiction on your part, as if the impossibility had only proceeded from my own want of due enquiry, of due solicitation.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had given evidence about his experience of the Library to the Commission on the British Museum, <date when="1849-02-08">8 Feb. 1849</date>; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490210-TC-MAC-01"><sic>23:231&#x2013;32</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1849-02-10">10 Feb. 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>At the present time, I shall be extremely happy if that rumour have been a true one; if I actually can, by any honest industry of mine, procure a quiet place to study in, now and then, in your Establishment. For I am again in want of many helps which are in the Museum; and in the common reading-room, as new experience teaches me, I labour under sad disadvantages in using them.</p>
<p>If you could give me a good word of indication on this subject, certainly it would be very welcome, or I could meet you any day at the Museum, if that were furthersome or necessary. At any rate if you are obliged to refuse me, I <pb id="pg-28-106" n="28:106"/>shall know it was with regret; I shall be no worse off than at present, and shall have exhausted the shadow of likelihood there was for me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Panizzi replied, <date when="1853-04-12">12 April</date>: &#x201C;I do not recollect ever having stated that either you or any one else could have a private room to study in at this institution. I did on the contrary say that everything ought to be done that could possibly be done to make the reading rooms comfortable for the use of the public, but that all readers should be&#x2014;and were in point of fact&#x2014;treated alike at the British Museum. You must see how invidious it would be to make any distinction. I do not know &#x2026; any library in the world of equal extent &#x2026; in which as much has been done for the readers&#x2019; comfort and convenience, as far as the available space and means allow. Our reading-rooms are not of course as quiet and as snug as a <hi rend="italic">private</hi> study; ours is a <hi rend="italic">public</hi> place; no public conveyance can equal a private carriage: even in a first class carriage you must occasionally put up with squalling babies and be deprived of the pleasure of smoking your cigar. &#x2026; / If, on your applying to the Trustees, you find them disposed to make an exception in your favor &#x2026; , I shall obey their directions to the best of my power; but I do not see how I can of my own accord make any exception in favor of any reader, however high his literary claims and great my wish to serve him.&#x201C; The trustees approved &#x201C;the tone of Panizzi&#x2019;s letter, and made no order that [TC] should have special treatment&#x201C; (<date when="1853-05-07">7 May 1853</date>; see P. R. Harris, <hi rend="italic">A History of the British Museum Library, <date when="1753">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1973">1973</date></hi> [<date when="1998">1998</date>] 230).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>My Better Half is out; for my own share, I say <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC writes on Tues.</note> and (decisively) <hi rend="italic">Tea</hi> at half past seven. Tea (especially with tobacco) is infinitely the preferable meal for the wretched person now addressing you!</p>
<p>If you hear <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> farther, therefore, let this be considered a fixed thing.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Yours ever truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC expressed his despair about <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and his life in general in his Journal, <date when="1853-04-13">13 April</date>: &#x201C;Still struggling and <foreign>haggling</foreign> about Frederick; ditto, ditto, alas, about many things!

<p>We are sorry to hear of your ill fate in regard to health, while otherwise the innocent rural joys are offered you. The air is again so bitter and cold, there is no being <hi rend="italic">well</hi> in it anywhere; neither spring foliage nor the human skin can prosper in such an element.</p>
<p>I got home at my appointed time from Hampshire; but with very little conquest to boast of from the adventure; and in fact so broken and confused by the restless shadowy mode of life, and the incurably unsuitable <hi rend="italic">dietetic</hi> hours, I had to lie pretty much upon my oars for a week after, and have never yet got into very vigourous motion, at least towards any goal that I can reckon definite. I have been much concerned with poor <hi rend="italic">Vehse</hi> and the Hanover monsters,&#x2014;cousins of the Prussian Fritz&#x2019;s great-grandmother, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ahnfrau</hi></foreign> [ancestress] too of our present agreeable family,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick&#x2019;s great grandmother Louisa Henrietta of the House of Orange (<date when="1627">1627</date>&#x2013;<date when="1667">67</date>), m. Friedrich William, elector of Brandenburg. She was aunt of William III of England and I of Scotland. Her son, Friedrich I of Prussia, m. Sophie Charlotte, sister of the elector of Hanover who became Britain&#x2019;s George I. Her grandson (Frederick the Great&#x2019;s father), Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, m. Sophie Dorothee, da. of George I.</note> the lightheaded luckless Duchess of Ahlden, George the First&#x2019;s Wife, has been occupying me not a little.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sophie Dorothee (<date when="1666">1666</date>&#x2013;<date when="1726">1726</date>) m., <date when="1682">1682</date>, George, crown prince of Hanover (later George I). She was accused of a liaison with a young Swedish nobleman, Count Philipp Christoph von K&#xF6;nigsmark; the count simply &#x201C;disappeared; she was arrested, tried, and divorced, and imprisoned for thirty-two years at the Castle of Ahlden, thereafter known as the Princess von Ahlden.&#x201C; See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:26&#x2013;30.</note> In these poor Hanover people I find, as has often been my surmise before, a very considerable <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> faculty,&#x2014;really a &#x201C;greatness&#x201C; somewhat a little different <pb id="pg-28-108" n="28:108"/>from that of &#x201C;great <hi rend="italic">blockheads</hi>&#x201C; (as John Mill once urged when I was talking in that strain):&#x2014;courage, sullen instinctive resolution and persistency; an inarticulate gloomy strength, solidity and loyalty, which Nature does a little respond to, and acknowledge to be more royal than some other qualities that figure from the barrelhead and &#x201C;place in parliament&#x201C; as far superior. There are traces of a kind of Fate running thro&#x2019; their history,&#x2014;like that of a stupified Atrides genealogy: madness and blindness;&#x2014;given an <hi rend="italic">AEschylus</hi> (who alas is terribly undiscoverable; but if he <hi rend="italic">were</hi> given) then the <hi rend="italic">Tragedy</hi> would not be wanting either!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Atrides were Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, whose tragedy was dramatized by Aeschylus (525&#x2013;456 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi>). TC refers to &#x201C;the K&#xF6;nigsmark tragedy&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:28&#x2013;30).</note>&#x2014; On the whole, it has laid great hold of me, this cataract of scandals and flagrancies which poor Vehse has poured out from his historical urn: in that wild delirious torch-dance of confusions, platitudes, errors and delusions (of Vehse&#x2019;s and of Vehse&#x2019;s Heroes&#x2019;), I have occasionally got glimpse into the regions of the unspeakable! That is the benefit from Vehse.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I designed to have written to you at an earlier period of the day; but was prevented by Morgan the Carpenter coming in upon me, and turning all my enterprises heels overhead. For we are again getting under the dominion of that r<supplied>[edou]</supplied>btable person; he is again (on the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Monday hence) to get possession of us for a week: Book-cases, window apparatus; and the painting of the upper room,&#x2014;to be followed, at some unknown time, by the painting and papering of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> poor room in which I yet sit with bare walls, and in half gypsey fashion, all this while!&#x2014;In all your arrangements of life, whatsoever you do or forbear, avoid one thing, as next to utter conflagration, &#x201C;a thorough repair!&#x201C; I should as soon have given my right hand to be cut off, had I known what &#x201C;a thorough repair&#x201C; meant, in consenting to it. However, however&#x2014;</p>
<p>Your news about my Mother was right welcome and indispensable; I hope soon to have another little Note from you, with account of a new visit: my poor old Mother,&#x2014;Heaven is very merciful to deal with us so in that respect: alas, I have grown <hi rend="italic">used</hi> to the Mercy; and my imagination gives a haggard start when I think that these are not things which <hi rend="italic">can</hi> continue! But let us not be ungrateful, not <hi rend="italic">unhopeful</hi>, which is the worst ingratitude to a Bounteous Giver!&#x2014;It seems to me, all this winter, as if we had all got dreadfully <hi rend="italic">old</hi>, as if <pb id="pg-28-110" n="28:110"/>the <foreign>clapsydra</foreign> [water clock] were rushing rapidly out with all of us, and this sorely confused game of life were verging towards the still Eternities. I often enough think of these things: nor are they wholly sad and painful; there is a feeling of victory and stern blessedness withal in the thought that one is actually grown <hi rend="italic">old</hi>. We will say no more of it just now.</p>
<p>I get very ill on with work; little better than for a long while past, which, God knows, is badly enough. But I do not quite give up either; I puddle along, and shall perhaps emerge out of the cesspools one day. So much labour has been expended upon <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi>, and no daylight will yet shine thro&#x2019; that enterprise: however, I suppose we <hi rend="italic">must</hi> persist, at this stage, and get delivered in some tolerable way if we can.&#x2014;I am at present on some negociation for admission to the <hi rend="italic">inner</hi> rooms of the Museum: but Panizzi, who can himself do nothing, is not encouraging; tomorrow I am to see Hallam,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his role as an elected trustee.</note> and unless he give me some heart (which the good soul will if he can), I shall quietly let the matter drop. After all, <hi rend="italic">Books</hi> are not what will make one wise: it is astonishing what little <hi rend="italic">profit</hi>, in any form whatever, one too often gets out of Books! With Prussian Books on <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi>, for example, one might load a waggon; and the <hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi> even Prussians have of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> I find to be frightfully like <hi rend="italic">Zero</hi>, in spite of Books. Not one <hi rend="italic">genial</hi> Book yet exists on the subject.</p>
<p>Maccall started his Lecturing Enterprize sunday gone a week: big room in Oxford Street (once Gavazzi&#x2019;s), admittance 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, subject Scotch Covenanters,&#x2014;present 28!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maccall lectured at the Princess&#x2019;s Concert Room, Castle St., on three successive Sunday mornings, <date when="1853-04-03">3</date>, <date when="1853-04-10">10</date>, and <date when="1853-04-17">17 April</date>, on &#x201C;Scottish Covenanters,&#x201C; &#x201C;England the Conqueror,&#x201C; and &#x201C;The Agents of Civilization&#x201C; (ads., <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1853-04-02">2</date>, <date when="1853-04-09">9</date>, and <date when="1853-04-16">16 April</date>). The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1853-04-02">2 April</date>, also carried an advertisement for Maccall&#x2019;s eight pamphlets pbd. by John Chapman. For Alessandro Gavazzi, see <ref target="volume-26/ed-26-biographical-notes"><sic>26:294</sic><corr>26:biographical note</corr></ref>.</note> It takes near three score to pay expenses. The poor man did not seem to be discouraged, however; &#x201C;very well for a beginning&#x201C;: last sunday, another trial, with some alterations of arrangement; audience <hi rend="italic">now</hi> 54. He decides to get a smaller cheaper room, and charge <hi rend="italic">a shilling:</hi> that will perhaps do better. He <hi rend="italic">writes</hi> to me on Monday what the issue has been; to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> much of him is not very inviting, tho&#x2019; once and away he is good for a monthly dialogue or so. The health of the man improves visibly: poor soul, perhaps he will get this lecturing speculation to answer a little, by and by, after all.&#x2014;Fairey<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Farie.</note> I saw on the street yesterday, who had been to hear Maccall; and professed to have <hi rend="italic">business</hi> with me on that score,&#x2014;but had been refused by Fanny, he said! The unfortunate Farey; &#x201C;well in health,&#x201C; but gloomy, aimless and idle, as is the common lot of him.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>This is Friday night; and I will write you a little word, lest tomorrow I may have still less time. The <hi rend="italic">tea</hi> has been delayed tonight; for we are expecting a Miss Wynne, a <foreign><hi rend="italic">braw</hi></foreign> Welsh Lady, a great friend of Jane&#x2019;s; who comes down once in the quarter of a year, and is very fair company on a time. She is about forty, still very beautiful, tall and bright; an elderly maid, of much accomplishment, and superior sense and information. It is in waiting for her that I have got up stairs into my own room; and am struggling to bring up the leeway of the day, which has been interrupted by too many things.</p>
<p>We got John&#x2019;s Letter, written after he had seen you about a week ago. His accounts were not quite so flourishing as formerly, yet still what we must call good; and he pacified my apprehensions of the cold weather having hurt you at that time. Alas, it is again very cold; fierce as winter itself for some days past; wind sticking in the north, sometimes loud blasts of it, and no sun at all; all which makes a day that will not suit my poor old Mother <supplied>[at]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> all! Perhaps you are not so cloudy and grey as we: when the sun gets out, it makes a great difference; and to one that can walk vigorously, it is already <hi rend="italic">too</hi> hot now and then. Such a capricious season for weather I can hardly recollect: one has never done with sudden changes. I advise you stay within doors; do not venture out except when the sun is shining, and that northwind <hi rend="italic">not</hi> blowing.</p>
<p>Jane keeps moving about, tho&#x2019; the cold weather does not suit her; she suffers now and then from want of sleep (which indeed means just the want of <hi rend="italic">health</hi> and want of strength), and worst when the days and nights are so cold. I, for my own part do not now complain of the weather, it is so suitable for long brisk walks when one is all buttoned together. No leaves are yet out, or hardly any; they were just coming, when this cold set in and checked them. I keep struggling away and <hi rend="italic">endeavouring</hi> to work; but I cannot yet say, with much success. Alas, alas! But I must just struggle on and endeavour <hi rend="italic">better</hi>. Many a time do I think of your good saying, &#x201C;Patience, come and help me!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Poor Maccall, of whom I told you, is trying to <hi rend="italic">lecture;</hi> does not make much speed hitherto, I doubt; but will perhaps get into better progress as he goes on. His health is steadily mending; he has money to stand some 3 or 4 months <pb id="pg-28-113" n="28:113"/>of diligent <hi rend="italic">trial</hi> in this new line;&#x2014;and of course he will do his very utmost, poor soul.&#x2014;Some German people, <hi rend="italic">Reichenbachs</hi> (that is their name), with whom Jane has grown rather intimate in the last year (for they have been neighbours, are really good people, and were friends <hi rend="italic">of</hi> old friends of ours), are just now packing up to be off bodily to America. Reichenbach was a rich nobleman in Germany five years ago; but had the misfortune to be sent to their <hi rend="italic">Parliament</hi> during the troubles in that country; and now, really without fault of his, he finds himself deprived of all his properties but some little wreck he was able to save in time; <hi rend="italic">condemned</hi> also to &#x201C;10 years of the hulks&#x201C; (if they could catch him),&#x2014;and in fine, just setting off to America to become a farmer there. Jane is much concerned about them. The Wife, a sickly but very good and sensible little woman (who can speak almost no English, unluckily), has been much about her since they came to these parts. They go for Liverpool on Monday.</p>
<p>Here are some German things, and a Letter of Neuberg&#x2019;s, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you can give to the Dr when he next comes to Scotsbrig: they are of no consequence at all, but may amuse him for a moment before going to the fire.&#x2014; &#x2014; We are far on in the <hi rend="italic">2</hi>d <hi rend="italic">Ham</hi> of the Scotsbrig Two, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I grieve to say is the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> of all! We began first upon the other Scotsbrig one; but finding it a little <hi rend="italic">new</hi>, took to the Yorkshire; ate those, then <hi rend="italic">it</hi> (which was very good too, tho&#x2019; not salt), and lastly are upon this, which is a disappearing in a most victorious manner! &#x201C;It is but fair to state,&#x201C; there cannot readily be a better Ham; and often in eating my portion in the sharp mornings I think of the kind friends that are so good to us always!&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>Farewell, dear good Mother, till I write again in a few days.&#x2014; Miss Wynne did come before I had done; and it is <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> now when I end. Love to all. Ever your <foreign>Bairn</foreign></salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Greig</salute>
<p>In the name of your long affection for my Mother, and her no less constant affection for you, I recommend to you a most dear and excellent friend of ours, the Count Oscar von Reichenbach, thro&#x2019; whom you will receive this letter. Whatever kindness you will show him, I shall feel more obliged by, than if it had been shown directly to myself, and you will find it &#x201C;it&#x2019;s own reward&#x201C; too; for a man of more upright character, and more noble bearing I could not introduce to you.</p>
<p>Driven from his natural position in Silesia, by the disturbances of 48, he <pb id="pg-28-114" n="28:114"/>goes now, after two years residence in London, with a delicate wife and three little children, to make himself a new home in America, and it is in the hope that the course of his investigations, before deciding where to buy land, may bring him near <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, that I give him this introduction: for your advice would be as useful to him, as your courtesy would be cheering in a strange land.</p>
<p>Your old friend my Uncle John is pretty well just at present, but his life has been often threatened of late years&#x2014;a little grandchild, a new John Welsh,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander and Sophie Welsh&#x2019;s son.</note> is come some months since to cheer him up, and it has performed that mission wonderfully. His second daughter Jeanie is to be married on the 28<hi rend="italic">th</hi> to a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Chrystal of Glasgow, after a courtship of ten years.</p>
<p>I have been only once in Scotland since my Mother&#x2019;s death&#x2014;It is too sad, where one possessed so much, to find now only <hi rend="italic">graves!</hi> For <hi rend="italic">you</hi> too I fancy Scotland must have become too sad; since I have not heard of your being there lately nor of your coming&#x2014;When you do come dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Greig do not fail to let me see you&#x2014;to see any one that knew and loved my Mother always does me such good!</p>
<p>My Husband is always writing and always dyspeptic. At present he is busy with a life of Frederick the Great which <hi rend="italic">hangs fire</hi> terribly&#x2014; He (M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C.) is quite what they call &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a Power</hi>,&#x201C; now in England; but I dont feel that one is happier for that!</p>

<p>Oh Heavens could this be true? Should <hi rend="italic">I</hi>, if I lived, be one day unmoved to meet those I loved ungrieved to part from them?! It is <hi rend="italic">thirty</hi> years since then and the doom of indifference is not fallen on me <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> however,&#x2014;and I verily believe that the Bishop was a false prophet when he foretold that <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> or any other power, of Earth or of Heaven, or of the <hi rend="italic">Other Place</hi> even, could ever bottle up <hi rend="italic">my</hi> tears&#x2014; Yes it is a gift that has its costs to be born with a tendency to take things well to heart!

<p>This morning they are all on the Sea I suppose! and the house in Paulton square stands with half closed shutters looking as if death were in it!&#x2014; So goes it in the World!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yes Saffi is indeed here and it was a shame I did not tell you at the first But I have been so ill and out of heart&#x2014; He looked uncommonly fat and well coloured when he came, and was in fine spirits!&#x2014;being pursued &#x2018;for his Life&#x2019; had evidently agreed with him&#x2014;his under chin is shaved&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">unhappily</hi> I must <pb id="pg-28-116" n="28:116"/>think&#x2014;and he is writing for the <hi rend="italic">London &#x26; Westminster</hi> Now if Mazzini had but got to harbour as safe! <hi rend="italic">his</hi> coming will be an affair of the utmost danger<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini had been in Geneva since mid-<date when="1853-02">Feb.</date> and was to arrive in London, mid-<date when="1853-05">May</date>.</note></p>
<p>I should like to go to you at once&#x2014;now&#x2014;but the workpeople are coming in again on Monday for at least one week&#x2014; So soon as I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> get away I will write and ask if you can have me for <hi rend="italic">a few days</hi>, that sounds <hi rend="italic">extensive</hi> does it not?</p>
<p>Your Uncle is going to you&#x2014;and I pray you all to be kind to him.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I believe the usual Academic equipments, Latin, Greek &#x26;c, are practically attainable in Dublin, London, Edinburgh, Glasgow (in all of which places there are Professors of accredited repute);&#x2014;attainable, that is, by a man sufficiently bent upon the enterprise; as indeed they are anywhere, by <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a man, witness Warburton who continued an Attorneys Clerk till he became &#x201C;learned&#x201C; to that extent;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After his B.A., Trinity College, Cambridge, <date when="1833">1833</date>, Eliot Warburton studied conveyancing and was admitted to the Irish bar, <date when="1837">1837</date>.</note> while to the opposite kind of man, as we have examples enough, they continue everywhere unattainable. A far graver question were, Whether the road to <hi rend="italic">Wisdom</hi> does really, in present centuries, lie thro&#x2019; that turnpike at all; whether the game, in such a case as yours, is anything like worth the candle! But on that we do not enter at present.&#x2014; &#x2014; For the rest, London (tho&#x2019; there is an excellent Classicist, Professor Newman,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis William Newman (<date when="1805">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1897">97</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20019"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441007-JWC-GEJ-01"><sic>18:234</sic><corr>JWC to GEJ, <date when="1844-10-07">7 Oct. 1844</date></corr></ref> and <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:184), prof. of Latin, Univ.

Hall, London, since <date when="1848">1848</date>.</note> in employment there) would certainly seem to me a very unfit place for preparatory study, the interruptions to study of any sort being so enormous in a monstrous chaotic Capital like London: but I ought to say, my own available acquaintance with such Seminaries and their capabilities amounts, at present, <pb id="pg-28-117" n="28:117"/>to mere <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>, my interest in them and their pursuits having been upon the decline this long while (indeed, ever since I myself got out of their distracted precincts, with life still in me); and, of course, you will consult your contemplated Professor himself, before entering on such a career in any place.</p>

<salute>My dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; it is a long time since I have written to you, no mistake can be greater than that I have forgotten you! No, no, there is no danger of that; my memory at least is active enough! But I live in such a confused whirlpool of hurries here as you can have no conception of; am <hi rend="italic"><supplied>[al]</supplied>ways</hi> in poor weak health, too, and in corresponding spirits; and for most part, when my poor stroke of work for the day is done (if, alas, I be lucky enough to get any &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">work</hi>&#x201C; done, one day in ten, as days now go!)&#x2014;I have in general nothing for it but to shut up my ugly cellar of confusions, and address myself to the task of being <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>,&#x2014;writing no letter whatever but those I absolutely cannot help. That is the real truth. And you must not measure my regard for you by the quantity I <hi rend="italic">write</hi>, but by quite other standards.</p>
<p>We regularly see your letters here; and are very glad indeed to observe that you get on so well. The fits of ague-fever you had at first were a severe introduction, and began to be alarming to us; but I can hope now it was only the <foreign><hi rend="italic">hanselling</hi></foreign> of you in your new climate; and that henceforth you will go on with at least your old degree of health. One thing I have understood to be of great moment (indeed I am sure of it) in the Canada climate: it is, to take good care that your house be in an airy situation, quite free from the neighbourhood of damp ground, especially of stagnant water, and with a free exposure to the wind. That indubitably is of great importance: you are accustomed, from sound old Annandale, to take no thought at all about such things; but, you may depend on it, they are necessary and indispensable considerations in your new country; and I beg you very much to keep them earnestly in view with reference to the house you live in. Plenty of dry wind, all marshes &#x26;c at a distance, and there is no more danger of ague in Canada than in Scotland. That you shore up your windows in season, and keep your <pb id="pg-28-118" n="28:118"/>house <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> as a new pin: these are advices I need not give, for you follow these by course of nature, or inveterate habit, being from of old one of <hi rend="italic">neatest</hi> little bodies to be found in five parishes!&#x2014; &#x2014; In all remaining respects; I find you have chosen clearly for the better; and, I doubt not, are far happier in your reunited household than you ever were, or could have been, in Dumfries. It was a wise and courageous adventure of you, to take the Ocean by the face in search of these objects; and all your friends rejoice to learn that it has succeeded. Long and richly may you reap the rewards of your quiet, stout and wise behaviour, then &#x26; all along, under circumstances that were far from easy to manage. And God&#x2019;s blessing be on you always, my poor little Jenny!&#x2014; I hope, too, poor Robert has learned many a thing, and forgotten many a thing, in the course of his hard fortune and wide wanderings. Give him my best wishes, temporal and spiritual; <hi rend="italic">help</hi> him faithfully what you can, and he (for he has a kind enough heart) will do the like by you;&#x2014;and so, we hope, all will be <hi rend="italic">better</hi> with you both than it is with many, and continue to grow better and better to the end.&#x2014; I recommend myself to the nice <foreign><hi rend="italic">gleg</hi></foreign> little lasses, whom I shall not forget, but always think of as <hi rend="italic">little</hi> however <hi rend="italic">big</hi> they grow. My blessings on you all.</p>
<p>No doubt, you know by eyesight whom these two <hi rend="italic">Talbottypes</hi> represent! Mine is very like; Jane&#x2019;s (done by a different process) is not quite so like, but it will serve for remembrance. I begged <hi rend="italic">two pairs</hi> of them a while ago, and sent one to Alick (<hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Jane</hi> slightly different in his set); the other pair I now send to you,&#x2014;and wish only it were some <hi rend="italic">usefuller</hi> gift. However, they will eat no bread; and so you may give them dry lodging: that is all they want. I heard from the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at Moffat the day before yesterday: he reports our good old Mother to be in her usual way, and now with the better prospect of summer ahead. Poor Mother, she is now very feeble; but her mind is still all there, and we should be thankful.&#x2014;The rest are well; John to quit Moffat in <date when="1853-07">july</date>, but [several words missing] Jane sends her kind regard. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> [words missing]</p>

<salute>My dear good Mother,</salute>
<p>I will, as usual, send you a short word before the week end, tho&#x2019; in truth there is, as it were, <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to tell. We go along here as quietly as we can possibly manage; the more quietly, the better for us always; and have little to <pb id="pg-28-119" n="28:119"/>do with the noisy activities and rumours that occupy men&#x2019;s minds in this restless neighbourhood of ours. We are both still going about in what is called our &#x201C;usual way&#x201C;; neither of us professing to be at all <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than usual; and yet I think poor Jane is rather a little below par for a week or two past,&#x2014;very ill off for <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> now and then,&#x2014;which I impute to the severe weather we had so long; a thing more or less deranging to everybody&#x2019;s health. She is out today, in the bright sunshine somewhere, and I have not seen her since breakfast-time: for three days before, owing to a dreary <hi rend="italic">eastwind</hi> rain or damp drizzle (which was always prevalent, and, yesterday, never ceased at all), there has been little outgate for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>. She is very tough too, and is not plagued with her headaches as of old. Next week we are to have the carpenters again; their sad job was not ended last year after all! Happily it is only for a few days this time; finishing my Book shelves, putting on <hi rend="italic">outer</hi> window-blinds (against the hot weather) &#x26;c: what remains of painting, we design to put off till Autumn, till we ourselves are fairly out of the way of it. I trust this may be the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> time I shall ever have to be concerned in &#x201C;repairing&#x201C; a house, especially in London!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My poor &#x201C;work&#x201C; is getting on dreadfully <hi rend="italic">ill;</hi> alas, I am much to blame in it myself withal; no longer so <hi rend="italic">swift</hi> and spirited, perhaps,&#x2014;and yet I too often neglect to employ well all the strength I still have. Woe&#x2019;s me! There is nothing whatever in life that I deliberately put any value upon, except this of getting something worthy and useful <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, while days are granted me in this world; and that itself escapes daily out of my hands,&#x2014;and I cannot get along towards any winning-post at all. &#x201C;Much of my life has been trifled away!&#x201C; as poor old Johnson said.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Preface, <hi rend="italic">A Dictionary of the English Language</hi> (<date when="1755">1755</date>).</note> Alas!&#x2014; But really there is nothing can set this old horse fairly on his feet, but putting him into a right rage of remorse against himself for lying helpless: &#x201C;very stiff t&#x2019;ye reise, Sandy, man!&#x201C; So I must not quarrel with my present dispiritments; but struggle to do better,&#x2014;better in time coming. Up, up, thou stiff old spavined Hacklog; up, while it is called today!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have been twice out this week, at Bath House (the Ashburtons&#x2019;), and are to go again tonight; which is rather heavy duty! Jane likes it (I think) a degree better than I do; and yet not she very much. There is plenty of bright witty talk, but very little <hi rend="italic">wisdom</hi> going; which is a great pity, and common in human assemblages at present. On the <date when="1853-05-02">2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of May</date>, which will be 10 days hence, we are to be at a Ball (forsooth) by Lady Stanley,&#x2014;which will do little for <hi rend="italic">one</hi> individual that I am acquainted with! In fact had it not been that those Stanleys are among our oldest friends here, I should have been <hi rend="italic">off</hi> at once; that would not do, however. Happily it is our last visiting adventure for the present; happily too our Bath House tonight is not a <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi>, only a &#x201C;party,&#x201C;&#x2014;that is, 5 or 600 &#x201C;distinguished people&#x201C; gathered together to simmer about, and go grinning and becking, and exchanging <hi rend="italic">short</hi> witty talk with one another. <pb id="pg-28-120" n="28:120"/>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Oh Whow!</hi>&#x201C; as Grahame ejaculates. However, one can come away whenever one likes; that is always something!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Dear old Mother, may I not hope this sunnier weather will now do you some good too? You have stood the hard dark months, weak as you often were, very bravely; and now there are many things in your favour. Oh, let us thank the Giver of all Good for His merciful lovingkindnesses towards us (for such they truly are); let us trust in Him, and tho&#x2019; the world fall in pieces, no Evil can overtake us! It is one of the greatest comforts to me to reflect that my dear and brave old Mother was and is a <hi rend="italic">pious</hi> Mother reverent of God and trustful in Him: <hi rend="italic">His</hi> blessing be upon her,&#x2014;and upon all of us, forevermore!</p>
<p><closer><salute>I&#x2019;ll add no more; but subscribe myself (with love to them all)</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>I have sent Jean a Book which came to me today; it is very long since I heard from her.&#x2014; I also wrote to Jenny, in Canada, this week.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter from poor Jenny which you will be very glad of; it came last night, and I send it off without loss of a post: I had written to her (as I think I mentioned to you) only on friday last,&#x2014;enclosing a <hi rend="italic">Portrait</hi> of Jane and one of myself, of the kind <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had a sample of;&#x2014;in due time these will get to Hamilton,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >SE Ontario.</note> with the little message attending them; and give a moment&#x2019;s satisfaction to poor little Jenny and her household.</p>
<p>The other Letter here included is from John Gordon; and it too, if you can manage to read it (for Gordon writes very indistinctly), will be of some interest. I did not know the least about poor Mrs Glen, or whether she was in this country, whether even in this world! I was awakened to many old kind recollections, last night, at sight of Gordon&#x2019;s message to me; and answered immediately that I would with my whole heart sign the Petition, and do whatever I could to help it forward otherwise. I fear poor Mrs Glen is in straits as to her money affairs, now that her Husband is removed from the scene; and, alas, I am not at all certain that anything real can be expected from this second Petition; but I will certainly do all I can for it: and if this do not succeed, something else ought to be set about.</p>
<p>We have had two days or more of ugly <hi rend="italic">north-wind</hi> rain; which is now gone, and has given place to North-wind <hi rend="italic">sun</hi> today; a still cold, but much pleasanter kind of weather. I wonder always how my good old Mother is standing it! John, I trust, will write to me again this week.&#x2014; I am driven out of my Library, by joiners, since yesterday morning; I sit up here in my neat enough little bedroom (on the <hi rend="italic">back</hi> of the house, and on the top or <hi rend="italic">third</hi> story); a comfortable city of refuge, as things go, where I hear fewer noises, and look out upon gardens and green places (once the <hi rend="italic">Bishop of Winchester&#x2019;s Park</hi>)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bishops of Winchester had a palace in Cheyne Walk, <date when="1663">1663</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806">1806</date>.</note> with no Houses within a long gunshot of me. This was once <hi rend="italic">all</hi> green, and a <pb id="pg-28-122" n="28:122"/>fenced field with some sheep or horses occasionally in it; but, alas, it is now torn open; has a road open, a <hi rend="italic">short</hi> gunshot off me, and all on the <hi rend="italic">farther</hi> side of that road will soon be built upon,&#x2014;happily on this <hi rend="italic">hither</hi> side of it, they can only do one row (if that), and must then stop (owing to <hi rend="italic">private</hi> ownership &#x26;c): so that we shall still have fair breathing space, greatly better than the most have. The <hi rend="italic">rate</hi> at which London is incessantly swelling out on every side, is something, to me, quite <hi rend="italic">monstrous</hi> to look upon. Surely we have enough of people here already,&#x2014; nearly as many (2&#xBD; to 3 is the proportion) as are in all Scotland together! I said once to a man celebrating the miraculous extent of London: &#x201C;Yes, it is a big city; if it were as good as it is big, there would be nothing to desire in it!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane and I are to go out today, and &#x201C;make a call&#x201C; together,&#x2014;a call upon people of quality: whom we hope to find not at home! But I am to meet her in the London Library, which is near the scene, and I must keep to my time.&#x2014; A neighbour (whom we never spoke to, or likely shall speak to, and do not know by face) sent us in, last night, a little basket of excellent eggs, with compliments &#x26;c: he had already extinguished a crowing cock at my request.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Remington, 10 Cheyne Row; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521112-TC-GR-01"><sic>27:356&#x2013;57</sic><corr>TC to GR, <date when="1852-11-12">12 Nov. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> The people are extremely civil in reality; and do honour to Literature &#x26;c in my unworthy person. Which is one reward for staying <hi rend="italic">in one&#x2019;s place</hi>, which, of this restless population, very few do.&#x2014; &#x2014;Take care of yourself, dear Mother: this weather has still a harsh vein in it. Commend me to Jamie &#x26; Isabella: has &#x201C;young Jamie&#x201C; got stout again, and back to his work? <closer><salute>Farewell for today.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>It is a very long time indeed since I heard of you,&#x2014;never, I think, since the eve of your visit to Moffat, and Sister Phoebe, of which I expected some account. Was it I that was in debt? I did not understand so, in my imagination all this while; but there has nothing come. And indeed I can conceive reasons why you should be very languid, and indisposed to writing, just now.&#x2014; In fine, however it may be, I have snatched this bit of paper (a fortunate kind, which I have got lately, such as <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be written upon!), and I will bring you to mind of me once more&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have not a good life of it here for writing; or indeed for anything else, this somewhile: I am below par in health, rather than above, ever since my travels of last year; am getting sadly ill on with my work,&#x2014;fancy my work itself ill-chosen, inappropriate, and little profitable; get into no right enthusiasm about it, except the <hi rend="italic">reverse</hi>-enthusiasm of hearty rage and contempt against myself for not getting on with it (<hi rend="italic">which</hi> really will have to be my motive-power, I find): in short, I am driven upon my own resources a good deal; and pass my days not in a joyful manner at all. This ought to be my excuse with all friends and baulked correspondents; this really, if I compute it right, is adequate to cover in some measure a multitude of sins on my part. I have not yet got one line of <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi> put to paper, in a way that can escape the <hi rend="italic">fire;</hi> nor do I see any likelihood of managing that soon, or otherwise at all than in a tempest of &#x201C;steam-up,&#x201C; which makes me shudder to think of it.&#x2014; Let us quit these topics; there is nothing pleasant in them at all!</p>
<p>You got the Book I sent the other day, no doubt? My only uncertainty is about the use of it to you! It is by a young man, son of a Father who <hi rend="italic">translated</hi> <pb id="pg-28-124" n="28:124"/>far and wide in a very blurring manner (till the Whigs sent him to Hong Kong for a living to him); and cannot avail much, except in the absence of a better on that subject.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The father was John Bowring (<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872">1872</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3087"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310208-TC-JOBO-01"><sic>5:227</sic><corr>TC to JOBO, <date when="1831-02-08">8 Feb. 1831</date></corr></ref>), linguist, writer, and traveler; appointed by Palmerston as consul-general at Canton, <date when="1847">1847</date>; governor of Hong Kong, <date when="1854">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">59</date>; knighted, <date when="1854">1854</date>.

<p>I hear often from John: little bulletins about our Mother, which are a great favour to me, and come almost weekly. She is still weak, the dear old Mother,&#x2014;alas, how can we look for it otherwise? The bad weather acts unkindly on her, too; and all this week, while it is storming from the North (and today bitterly raining and draggling from that <foreign><hi rend="italic">airt</hi></foreign>, I am asking myself with apprehension, How is my poor old Mother standing this? I have got no Letter yet; but shall perhaps tomorrow.</p>
<p>Aird&#x2019;s Dr Browne has never turned up again, which I am really sorry for. Mrs Crowe of &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">Night</hi>-side of Nature&#x201C; (as she calls it), a great friend of Browne&#x2019;s,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Crowe, <hi rend="italic">The Night Side of Nature; or, Ghosts and Ghost Seers</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1848">1848</date>); friend of Dr. Samuel Brown.</note> told me <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to go to him, he was so languid and indisposed for talk, till <hi rend="italic">she</hi> warned me; and she&#x2014;has never warned me; nor have I heard elsewhere a word. I mean to go nevertheless, by and by. I fear, poor Browne is really hurt in the nervous-system, and has not been well advised to come to such a rough whirlpool of a place as this. However, it does afford a man means to <hi rend="italic">hide</hi> his sorrows quietly as no other place does; and that too may sometimes be the greatest solace left for a man! Surrounded by impertinent blockheads nobody here need be: he can say to all mortals, &#x201C;Worshipful mortals, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> do not take to one another, keep your own side of the way!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>I must now out, dear Jean; the rain is blowing about, and I see far off (being up in my bedroom, on the <hi rend="italic">back</hi> of the house this week) silent omnibuses and other vehicles scudding along with the reek of rain visible about them: I put on Gutta-Perchas (with your Dumfries <hi rend="italic">whangs</hi> in them), an oldish &#x201C;Kossuth wide-awake&#x201C; (not an ugly hat at all), and defy the weather.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Write me a word when you can.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I certainly ought to have announced at least that the <hi rend="italic">Postage Stamps</hi> came safe; and that nothing had gone wrong here! But I have been much occupied and bothered; and only answer the second of your Notes or two at once.</p>
<p>We have again very bitter weather here; of late days very sunless, windy (Northwind too); all things very bleak and cold: today there is brisk continued rain from the North, as there was on Monday last;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Fri.</note> and we long much, on all grounds, for an improvement of weather. My poor Mother: I am again very anxious about her in such a temperature! Her strength is worn to a thread, and she can stand nothing with impunity as she once could. I do hope this fit of winter climate will be the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> for this season. Pray do not neglect to send me Scotsbrig news whenever you have or can get any.</p>
<p>We have got the carpenters &#x26;c here all this week, as I predicted to you; I sit exiled aloft into my bedroom, not quite a bad place either, and quieter than below, only in cold weather <hi rend="italic">draughty</hi> (which will mean <hi rend="italic">lumbago-ish</hi>), and in all weathers, bookless. I am not sure these wretched people will even get out of my room tomorrow;&#x2014;but I must study to <hi rend="italic">suppress</hi> the volcanic emotions of the human mind, and wait, and wait! I have scribbled pretty diligently up here, and covered more paper than usual in the time (unhappily all will go to the <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> at last, and nothing is yet right anywhere):&#x2014;today again I am up to the neck in Letters of various kinds (so very few of them my own in any sense, eheu!)&#x2014;and shall not get a word <hi rend="italic">written</hi>, even for the fire. Steady, steady!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Neuberg, when we last heard of him about a fortnight ago, was paying visits in the Nottingham region, still to be out for 10 days: most probably he is now come home again tho&#x2019; we have not yet heard of him. His home Address is: &#x201C;25. Church Place, Hampstead&#x201C;; a Letter directed thither will of course be forwarded if needful.&#x2014; This too is one of the things I should have straightway told you.</p>
<p>Here is a Letter from Mrs Phillipps, &#x201C;Kitty Kirkpatrick&#x201C; that was;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Aurora (Kitty) Phillipps, b. Kirkpatrick (

Poor Kitty, what a business she has got of it, and her poor man has got: &#x201C;age is dark and unlovely&#x201C; in some respects! However, she seems to take it very gently, with real inarticulate piety (better than her articulate Roman-Catholic d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>); and is, in fact, a well conditioned, peaceably harmonious soul.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-126" n="28:126"/>The world is in love with Gladstone&#x2019;s Budget here; and, in spite of the desperate Protectionist-Irish strategies, it is confidently expected to pass, nearly unaltered, probably this week yet, or early next.

<p>Jane is often speaking about some notion she has of actually visiting you in Moffat; you will, I guess, hear of it articulately by and by. I myself feel utterly downcast at the notion of any <hi rend="italic">travel</hi> (with its tumults and horrors), &#x26; think often of trying to sit absolutely <hi rend="italic">still</hi> for this year. &#x201C;The country&#x201C;&#x2014;alas, yes, the country, and some other things; but to me there is little but loss and confusion appointed in the country, such an unhappy cobweb of a skin have I now got. &#x201C;Sparrow-like, companionless, on the housetop alone!&#x201C; (as the Psalmist wrote).<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 102:7.</note> <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother: there is some rage in me yet, I believe, if it were properly kindled. <hi rend="italic">Voyons</hi>.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You will not get the Papers tomorrow, after all; but I hope they are in <hi rend="italic">better</hi> hands, not worse, for them; and will not suffer by the delay.</p>
<p>I have had a Note from the Official Friend whom I mentioned to you; and by a lucky accident I fell in with him personally, over and above, and had a few minutes of useful conversation on the subject.</p>
<p>Having his Note in my pocket, I will (tho&#x2019; with proviso that <hi rend="italic">it go no farther</hi>, but be <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> as soon as you have read it) send you the little Document: it is not very encouraging; but the writer (Lord Stanley of Alderley, a very acute and at present an official man) keeps well within the margin in such matters; did not seem to have quite <hi rend="italic">understood</hi> the Note I wrote to him;&#x2014;and, on the whole, was considerably more cheering in his speech than he had been with <pb id="pg-28-127" n="28:127"/>the pen. He still thinks it questionable; but that there is hope,&#x2014;hope of something considerably better than &#x201C;the &#xa3;5 or &#xa3;10, &#x201C; which I told him at once would not be accepted at all.</p>
<p>Both Sir James Stephen, and Professor Wilson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Wilson.</note> are a little known to me: Sir James Stephen, being a stranger to all parts of the business, could do no good, and probably (being a veracious and a cautious man) might scruple to sign; but I did think of endeavouring to get Professor Wilson&#x2019;s unbiassed <hi rend="italic">verdict</hi> (by some method or other) as to the worth of the Persian Translation,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of the Old Testament (<date when="1845">1845</date>) and possibly the unfinished trans. of the New Testament.</note> and having it appended to the other evidences;&#x2014;however, Lord Stanley is of opinion that the point is already sufficiently <hi rend="italic">proved;</hi> that all points are so (for I have testified as to general matters which I knew); and, in short, that farther signatures will be of no service.</p>
<p>The great point, I can see, is to keep quite clear of its being a <hi rend="italic">Missionary</hi> question, and to lift the matter into the <hi rend="italic">Literary</hi> category. For Lord Aberdeen has already decided, on the <hi rend="italic">missionary</hi> point of view, and cannot be asked to revise his judgement. For that reason, Lord Stanley <hi rend="italic">dissuaded</hi> me from calling in the Marquis of Breadalbane to help (whom I got means of access to), as that would be bringing it back into the <hi rend="italic">religious</hi> point of view, and indispose Lord Aberdeen already committed on that side</p>
<p>On the whole it was Lord Stanley&#x2019;s opinion that the Duke of Argyll was far the fittest person for presenting the Petition, if he would consent; and Lord S. very kindly undertook to carry it to the Duke tomorrow,&#x2014;in whose hands it will be at the time you read this Note. &#x201C;We must not be too sanguine,&#x201C; alas no: but if the Duke do take any hold of the case, of course it will be somewhat in its favour; and I have just written a Letter to be <hi rend="italic">shewn</hi> him (by Lord Stanley), doing the best I could to dispose his Grace favourably to us:</p>
<p>In case he <hi rend="italic">be</hi> on our side, as I shall know soon, what is wanted now is that he be requested to present it <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> while the iron is <hi rend="italic">hot;</hi>&#x2014;and for that purpose I request one word from you <hi rend="italic">straightway</hi>, by return of post,&#x2014;if Mrs Glen &#x26; you approve that manner of proceeding. If you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, I will send back the Papers instantly.&#x2014; <closer><salute>In great haste,&#x2014; Yours sincerely&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Today I have only time for a word, to say that the Petition is presented; Lord Aberdeen has all the Documents now in his keeping; promises, with all <pb id="pg-28-128" n="28:128"/>gravity, and official reserve, to &#x201C;give them his consideration.&#x201C; That is all we yet know, or shall for some time.</p>
<p>It seems there is not likely to be a final Decision <hi rend="italic">till about the end of <date when="1853-06">June</date></hi>, at which time the Pension Fund is <hi rend="italic">voted:</hi> it will depend then, too, a little, on the number and the urgency of the other claims that may present themselves. We must wait with patience; there can, by you at least, be nothing more <hi rend="italic">done:</hi> the facts are considered sufficiently proved; and other signatures &#x26;c, I am assured, would be perfectly useless. Lord Stanley says, the only thing that can be done is, to leave the case with the Prime Minister; and to get, perhaps once or twice, some influential person,&#x2014;Lord Breadalbane, Duke of Argyll or the like,&#x2014;to remind him of it in the interim. This, you may be sure, I will take care to do. At the end of <date when="1853-06">June</date> we shall see!</p>
<p>From Lord Stanley, in the way of horoscope or prophecy, I could get nothing; the Premier too, as in duty bound, had been officially dark: so &#x201C;we must not be too sanguine!&#x201C; Nevertheless I myself do indulge a kind of hope that something will be got out of the business,&#x2014;some little, not much:&#x2014;and yet I have no grounds that I can give. All that is certain is, I will do my very best; and shall be disappointed if 
absolute <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> be the result as before.</p>
<p>The other night, being in a place where Lord Breadalbane was, I made acquaintance with him on this score; got his promise to speak to Lord Aberdeen; &#x26; have prepared a little Paper of <hi rend="italic">Memoranda</hi> for his use in that. I mean also to have myself introduced to the Duke of Argyll, if it ever be convenient again; I yesterday wrote a long letter to him on this matter, which is to be delivered by a good hand.</p>
<p>You need not write at present. I will write again if anything in the least significant turn up. Meanwhile assure my dear Mrs Glen that I will not neglect the post I have taken up,&#x2014;that she may peaceably rely on me, and wait with silent courage, as she is well used to do.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours very truly</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I got Jamie&#x2019;s Letter the night before last; which, tho&#x2019; it did not bring the best of news, was welcome to me, as guarding from apprehensions that were worse. A Note of the Doctor&#x2019;s had prepared to hear that you were frailer than usual in this bad time. And indeed I do not wonder at it; for the weather continues really intemperate, and Summer will not come, but still lags arear. We had 24 hours soaking rain this week; and that, I thought, would usher in the West Wind; it started with bright North again; and today there is North <pb id="pg-28-129" n="28:129"/><hi rend="italic">without</hi> brightness, with a damp grey sky, and one of the wintriest outlooks one could see in <date when="1853-05">May</date>. Patience, dear Mother, and take care of yourself: there must and will be some improvement in all that, before long!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are <foreign>haggling</foreign> on here, in the old way, not worse; some carpenters, putting up window-blinds, bookshelves, &#x26;c, invaded us for a week; but they are gone, and now only two painters (in a vacant room upstairs, with the door shut) follow their trade, and are neither heard nor <hi rend="italic">smelt</hi> to any extent at all,&#x2014;don&#x2019;t even awaken me in the mornings, who am on the other side of a thin partition. I try to work a little, too; but cannot be said to get brilliantly on, certainly not!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We went to a grand ball at Lady Stanley&#x2019;s the other night; very grand indeed, and &#x201C;regardless of expense.&#x201C; I found some people to speak to, and did not wholly weary; but was glad to get home again from such useless industry. Among others, I spoke to (got introduced to) Lord Breadalbane,&#x2014;for the sake of poor Mrs Glen and her Petition chiefly. This great Scotch Lord is a very stout jolly fellow, with a thick strong body, big grey head (which he carries free in the air) and pair of brisk eyes in it,&#x2014;a good deal like old &#x201C;Wullie Beattie,&#x201C; the Elder, of Hoddam,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;country carpenter&#x201C; and elder of the kirk; see Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 1:24&#x2013;25.</note> if he had been well cleaned up when about 55! He promised cheerfully to do what I requested in the Glen case;&#x2014;and I have taken measures to hold him to his word.</p>
<p>This Glen case has in fact taken some of my time; one of the Letters (not yet burnt) with an enclosure I send you today, as no doubt you are interested in the course that business takes, and well remember poor Mrs Glen and the rest. I know not what the issue of the thing will be: but I am using all diligence; have got the Petition actually presented to Lord Aberdeen; hope to get the above Breadalbane, and the Duke of Argyll, to speak to him successively on the subject;&#x2014;and on the whole, to work a small permanent addition to Mrs Glen&#x2019;s poor income,&#x2014;she hast at present only &#xa3;30 a-year, after all her travellings and toilings. The thing, it seems, is not likely to be decided till the end of <date when="1853-06">June</date>. So we must wait.&#x2014; I do not grudge a little trouble in the matter, if I could make out anything, and good Mrs Glen (now grown 64 years of age) deserves it at my hands.</p>
<p>They are making a <hi rend="italic">Sewer</hi> up our street here, to drain our impurities down into the river; and have made such a mess of the poor street as you never saw! Nothing but great ugly mounds of gravel dug out, and puddles of bricklayers, poles, bricks, and roman-cement going like street-mud. For the sewer is truly a work of art here. A big cut (I think almost 20 feet deep, at the lower end) is made first; then in the bottom of this is built, with all precautions, a complete <hi rend="italic">barrel</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">double</hi> arch, arch both in the bottom and top) of strong brickwork, where the water is to run; after which, with infinite rammings &#x26;c, they fill it up, and go their ways.&#x2014; The thing is disagreeable while adoing; but it will be <pb id="pg-28-130" n="28:130"/>very useful when done: so again we must be patient. &#x201C;Let us call on Patience&#x201C;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530416-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1853-04-15">15 April</date></ref>.</note> truly <hi rend="italic">she</hi> ought never to <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> out of call! I often think of that honest saying of my good old Mother&#x2019;s.</p>

<salute>Dear Owen,</salute>
<p>Here is an Extract of a Letter just received (after a long interval) from Emerson in America:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1853-04-19">19 April</date>.</note> if the man Mitchell<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ormsby MacKnight Mitchel (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862">62</date>), American astronomer; prof., Cincinnati College, <date when="1836">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">59</date>.</note> ever come athwart you, <hi rend="italic">pray</hi> bear it in mind.</p>
<p>&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x201C;One other American you may meet, Mr O. M. Mitchell, of Cincinnati, an astronomer, who is a good specimen of Western energy. He is an excellent observer (in his Observatory), and an inventor of telegraphic clock &#x26;c; known to your Airey and Adams.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Biddell Airy (<date when="1801">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892">92</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/251"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510616-TC-RO-01"><sic>26:91</sic><corr>TC to RO, <date when="1851-06-16">16 June 1851</date></corr></ref>), astronomer royal. John Couch Adams (<date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892">92</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/123"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), astronomer, discoverer of the planet Neptune, fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge; pres. of the Royal Astronomical Soc., <date when="1851">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853">53</date>, <date when="1874">1874</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876">76</date>.</note> He visits London now on behalf of a Railroad Company in Ohio,&#x2014;which has made him rich. He knows the Missisippi<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in Emerson&#x2019;s letter.</note> River;&#x2014;and if you have opportunity to say to Mr Owen, or Mr Forbes, or other Somerset-House gentlemen,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Forbes (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854">54</date>, <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9824"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), naturalist; prof. of botany, King&#x2019;s College, London, and pres. of the Geological Soc. Somerset House, in the Strand, housed several learned societies. Emerson had met Owen and Forbes in London, <date when="1848-03">March 1848</date>.</note> that our Mitchell is a Lecturer of very <pb id="pg-28-131" n="28:131"/>considerable talent, and should be heard at Albemarle Street,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the Royal Institution.</note> I think you will please him and them. He sent, or his friends sent, to me for&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c.</p>
<p>This is all my message about Mitchell; whom perhaps you have not heard of in London, any more than I; and who perhaps (it appears) has gone his ways again before this.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote that Mitchell &#x201C;sent, or his friends sent, to me, for any letters I might give him, before he went away; but too late for me to send to N.Y. But neither did I know the savans to whom he should go. Perhaps he is already on his return.&#x201C;</note> If he ever do appear in your sphere of things, however, and have not yet gone his ways, then pray remember this notice, and consider it (according to Emerson&#x2019;s wont) an <hi rend="italic">exact</hi> one, counterpart of the Mitchell <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>&#x2014;and decide that Albemarle Street may have something to do with it, or can have nothing, according as that other fact may be. If the man really has a capacity of telling mankind about the Missisippi Valley and its pigs and rattlesnakes and Indian Corn and <foreign>adipocere</foreign> [waxy fat], in an authentic and not too wordy manner, &#x201C;I guess&#x201C; he might be worth hearing in Albemarle Street for an hour.&#x2014; A good American man Emerson, thro&#x2019; me an indifferent British one, has hereby bequeathed his case to you.</p>
<p>I never saw more of you after that night in the Athenaeum; but I always calculate you will turn up by and by, with good omens, nevertheless. I am sunk very deep in multiplied confusion [two words missing] this long while; and sinking ever deeper; likely to get finally out of sight (I often think), and safe beyond soundings at last!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Landor,</salute>
<p>Forster has sent me my Book;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Imaginary Conversations of Greeks and Romans</hi> (<date when="1853">1853</date>); <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, ad., <date when="1853-05-07">7 May</date>, &#x201C;just published.&#x201C;</note> and you need not doubt I am proud enough of the Inscription you have put upon it,&#x2014;very thankful indeed to be remembered in such a way by such a man. The Book, wherever I glance into it, is clear and compact like polished steel; reminds us of the style of Virgil and Euripides and other extinct persons, in a way which has become <hi rend="italic">rare</hi>, or even <pb id="pg-28-132" n="28:132"/>unique, in these sad epochs!

<p>Several months ago I got an excellent Oil-Picture of you, and have it hanging here on the wall;&#x2014;nay it is near two years since the Portrait came into the house, but not till Spring last could it get into its right place; to remind me of the wrath of the divine Achilles now and then! I believe you sat for it on behalf of Lady Bulwer, some fifteen or twenty years ago: and indeed it was given by that unfortunate Lady to my Wife, at a time when they had some passages of beneficence together,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rosina, Lady Bulwer, b.

I have often thought of asking you to tell me <hi rend="italic">who was the Painter</hi>, that I might write it on the back of the Picture, for the benefit of Posterity; and now that my hand is in, I will hereby expressly do so.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Landor had evidently given the picture to Lady Bulwer, who then gave it to JWC. Landor apparently replied by return, as TC noted on the back: &#x201C;Walter Savage Landor, about <date when="1835">1835</date>, painted by Fisher (teste Landor ipso), Greek Street, London, <date when="1853-05-12">12th May 1853</date>.

<salute>Dear Clough,</salute>
<p>Today I got a very pleasant Letter from you,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Cambridge, Mass., <date when="1853-04-21">21 April</date>.</note> with many rough fresh glimpses into New-England life and ways; a pleasant accompaniment indeed to one&#x2019;s breakfast in a <date when="1853-05">May</date> morning. But for the last two days I have also had a Letter lying for you which I can hope will be no less pleasant. The Ashburtons <pb id="pg-28-133" n="28:133"/>are gone to Paris for a fortnight, and the Lady left it in my charge. It is not <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Letter, you perceive, which I am recommending as pleasant! No, it is the Inclosure; an Invitation to you to come home;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first letter was from Lord Granville to Lady Ashburton, <date when="1853-05-09">9 May</date>: &#x201C;I think it likely that it will be in my power to offer Mr. Clough the place of 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Examiner, whose salary will probably begin at 300&#xa3;, and increase to 600&#xa3; a year. I cannot at present guarantee this amount&#x201C; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530225-TC-AHC-01">TC to AHC, <date when="1853-02-25">25 Feb.</date></ref>, for Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s request to Lord Granville. The second letter was from Lady Ashburton to Clough [ <date when="1853-05-10">10? May</date>]: &#x201C;I think it best to send you this as it is. / I do not think you will hesitate, for though it may be less in emolument it is I imagine somewhat more interesting as well as of a higher order than the mere School Inspector. Mr. C. will write with this and thinks you can have no doubts in the matter added to which is the consideration that in the event of our looking for anything else you will have something <hi rend="italic">to give up</hi> in exchange.&#x2014; / Let us have a line as soon as you can, and Prefer us to America&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Clough</hi> 2:432).</note>&#x2014;I advise you, as Nature will, to lay this instantly aside, and to read that!&#x2014; &#x2014; Here we will pause till you have done so.</p>
<p>Now what is your opinion; or can there be two, in so brown a country, with the young frogs all making melody round you, and a new language springing up in the Philadelphia regions? I of course cannot pretend to judge in the last resort; but my decided impression is, you should write at once to Lord Granville, and say, Yes. England is England,&#x2014;even with all the Hudsons and Uncle-Tommeries it has. Your salary, at first starting, is not large; but it is always tending to grow larger, and becomes at last perfectly sufficient, and more, for a man whose wants are spiritual, and not Hudsonic but human: the work you have to do, which I understand consists in examining Candidate Schoolmasters, will surely be one of the quietest of useful works, and perfectly plain to you from the first. The small salary (if you think it small) will teach you noble thrift, and various high Spartan virtues, which are <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> more to a man than all the yellow rubbish which so many two-legged swine are grubbing for, with painfully assiduous snout, in California and the other Hemisphere:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The gold rushes in California, from <date when="1848">1848</date>, and in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia, <date when="1851">1851</date>.</note>&#x2014;virtues getting dreadfully uncommon at present; and betokening (if we recollect well what they mean) the <hi rend="italic">very Devil to pay</hi>, for all manner of persons and nations, by and by!&#x2014; In short, I suppose you will come? In that case, we may have a Translated Homer,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clough had written to his fianc&#xE9;e, Blanche Smith, [<date when="1853-01-13">13 Jan.</date>]: &#x201C;Homer I grieve to say is pretty nearly abandoned for the present; the vein of Hexameter verse was exhausted. &#x2026; About half the 1st book was done I think, perhaps a little more&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Clough</hi> 2:365). Clough was to continue to work on the trans. till he died.</note> and other fine things. But for the rest, understand me as not <hi rend="italic">advising</hi> at all, since no man can &#x201C;advise&#x201C;: only if you do come, it is certain there will several of us be very glad to see you again.</p>
<p>Lady Ashburton is the sole author of this Granville invitation that has <pb id="pg-28-134" n="28:134"/>turned up for you; to her direct what thanks in your mind may be due for it. I did say when the thing was done, It was a good work;&#x2014;but the doing of it, or the helping to do it, was none of mine.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clough eventually accepted the offer.</note></p>
<p>On other points I must say nothing today. Milnes, when he turns up, shall have your message.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To thank him for his letter and to say that &#x201C;&#x2018;involuntary servitude&#x2019; is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> an original stroke of genius on the part of the President, so far as I can learn. In the Constitution Slaves are not mentioned, but are twice alluded to, once included under the phrase, &#x2018;all other persons,&#x2019;&#x2014;and once, more directly, as &#x2018;person <hi rend="italic">held to labour</hi>&#x2019;&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Clough</hi> 2:422). Milnes had asked Clough, <date when="1853-03-28">28 March</date>: &#x201C;Is &#x2018;involuntary servitude&#x2019; the President&#x2019;s invention? It is a first rate euphuism and will do duty some time&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Clough</hi> 2:406).</note> I got Emerson&#x2019;s Letter<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1853-04-19">19 April</date>.</note> two or three days ago; and answer it by this mail: what you say of the man<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clough wrote: &#x201C;I have not found anyone here to compare to him for real solidity of intellect&#x2014;but I think Concord is rather a pokey sort of place&#x2014;and though it has an advantage in being out of the great thoroughfare of trade and dollar-making, it aggravates the tendency to what you call Gymnosophism. Democracy here, as in Athens, seems to have a natural tendency to provoke something of the Diogenes&#x2019; tub-philosophy&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Clough</hi> 2:420).</note> is eminently my own experience of him too; &#x201C;No other man, in America or Europe either,&#x201C; I often sadly say, &#x201C;who speaks as if he had an immortal soul in him, under this sky!&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Ach Gott</hi>, as we say in Philadelphia,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clough wrote: &#x201C;A new language, I am told, is slowly springing up&#x2014;the Anglo-American-Deutsch. Ich gleiche das is good Pennsylvania German for &#x2018;I like that&#x2019;: a man will say Mein Horse ist &#xfc;ber die fence gegangen, and will address an early morning visitor with Hast du ge-breakfasted?&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Clough</hi> 2:422).</note> it is the singing time and spawning time of the Frog genus,&#x2014;and the Stork, would he but arrive in these parts, were a sacred bird!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clough had mentioned &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">piping</hi> of the young frogs. If the stork &#x2026; eats frogs, it is deservedly held sacred&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Clough</hi> 2:422).</note></p>
<p>The Beecher-Stowe concern is tumbling along, I believe, amid the <date when="1853-05">May</date> Meetings, like the carcass of a big ass in a dunghill tank which many men are stirring with long poles. There was a big foolish meeting of quality people about it, last week again, in &#x201C;Aunt Harriet&#x2019;s Cabin,&#x201C;&#x2014;so they now call the Duchess&#x2019;s grand palace:&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">lunch</hi> with Mrs Stowe,&#x201C; which unexpectedly broke out in Speeches, &#x26;c.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Sat., <date when="1853-05-07">7 May</date>, at Stafford House, home of the duke and duchess of Sutherland, a group welcomed Harriet Beecher Stowe. The duke introduced her, and Shaftesbury spoke for the duchess and the &#x201C;ladies of the two committees appointed to conduct &#x2018;The Address of the Women of England to the Women of America on the subject of Slavery&#x2019;!&#x201C; Henry Ward Beecher (<date when="1813">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1887">87</date>), abolitionist Congregational clergyman, Mrs. Stowe&#x2019;s brother, replied. In conversation Mrs. Stowe said that most American women were opposed to slavery and only a few were vociferous supporters (<hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1853-05-14">14 May</date>).</note> It is a fact, however, that the great body of rational people are indifferent to it or more; and only the weak-minded and strong-lunged are concerned in these phenomena.</p>

<ps><p>The Description of Cambridge, given by such simple methods, is capital.&#x2014; The Dollar Note, having served its purpose here, ought, by the rule of Nothing-in-vain, to be <hi rend="italic">returned</hi>.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Blanche Smith; Clough wrote to her: &#x201C;I am going to put a letter to Carlyle inside. &#x2026; And what do you say&#x2014;? do you want the dollar-note, or will you send it on for him to see?

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>The sight of your handwriting was a real blessing to me, after so long an abstinence. You shall not know all the sad reflexions I have made upon your silence within the last year.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1853-04-19">19 April</date>; his previous letter was <date when="1852-06-02">2 June 1852</date>.</note> I never doubted your fidelity of heart; your genial deep and friendly recognition of my bits of merits, and my bits of sufferings, difficulties and obstructions; your forgiveness of my faults; or in fact that you ever would forget me, or cease to think kindly of me: but it seemed as if practically <hi rend="italic">Old Age</hi> had come upon the scene here too; and as if upon the whole one must make up one&#x2019;s mind to know that all this likewise had fallen silent, and could be possessed henceforth only on those new terms. Alas, there goes much over, year after year, into the region of the Immortals; inexpressibly beautiful, but also inexpressibly sad.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote: &#x201C;My own disobedience is wonderful &#x26; explains to me all the sins of omission of the whole world. The levity with which we can let fall into disuse such a sacrament as the exchange of greetings at short periods, is a kind of magnanimity &#x26; should be an astonishing argument of the &#x2018;Immortality.&#x2019;&#x201C;.</note> I have not many voices to commune with in the world. In fact I have properly no voice at all; and yours, I have often said, was the <hi rend="italic">unique</hi> among my fellow creatures, from which came full response, and discourse of reason:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 1.2.</note> the <hi rend="italic">solitude</hi> one lives in, if one has any spiritual thought at all, is very great in these epochs!&#x2014; The truth is, moreover, I bought spectacles to myself about two years ago (bad print in candle-light having fairly become troublesome to me); much may lie in that! <pb id="pg-28-136" n="28:136"/>&#x201C;The buying of your first pair of spectacles,&#x201C; I said to an old Scotch gentleman, &#x201C;is an important epoch; like the buying of your first razor.&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes,&#x201C; answered he, &#x201C;but not quite so joyful perhaps!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; Well, well, I have heard from you again; and you promise to be again constant in writing.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson said: &#x201C;And now be good &#x26; write me once more, &#x26; I think I will never cease to write again.&#x201C;</note> Shall I believe you, this time? Do it, and shame the Devil! I really am persuaded it will do yourself good; and to me I know right well, and have always known, what it will do.

For corn makes pig, pig is the export of all the land, &#x26; you shall see the distant dependence of aristocracy &#x26; civility on the fat fourlegs. Workingmen, ability to do the work of the River, abounded, nothing higher was to be thought of. America is incomplete. Room for us all, since it has not ended, nor given sign of ending, in bard or hero. Tis a wild democracy, the riot of mediocrities, &#x26; none of your selfish Italies and Englands, where an age sublimates into a genius, and the whole popularion is made into paddies to feed his porcelain veins, by transfusion from their brick arteries. &#x2026; Nature has only so much vital force, &#x26; must dilute it, if it is to be multiplied into millions. &#x2018;The beautiful is never plentiful.&#x2019; On the whole, I say to myself, that our conditions in America are not easier or less expensive than the European. For the poor scholar everywhere must be compromise or alternation, &#x26;, after many remorses, the consoling himself that there has been pecuniary honesty, &#x26; that things might have been worse. But no; we must think much better things than these.

Which will take some time yet, I think.&#x2014; And so we will leave it.</p>
<p>I went to Germany last Autumn; not <hi rend="italic">seeking</hi> anything very definite; rather merely flying from certain troops of carpenters, painters bricklayers &#x26;c &#x26;c who had made a lodgement in this poor house, and have not even yet got their incalculable riot quite concluded. Sorrow on them,&#x2014;and no return to those poor premises of mine till I have quite left!&#x2014; In Germany I found but little; and suffered, from 6 weeks of sleeplessness in German beds &#x26;c &#x26; c, a great deal. Indeed I seem to myself never yet to have quite recovered. The Rhine which I honestly ascended from Rotterdam to Frankfurt was, as I now find, my chief conquest: the beautifullest river in the earth, I do believe;&#x2014;and my first idea of a World-river. It is many fathoms deep, broader twice over than the Thames here at high water; and rolls along, mirror-smooth (except that in looking close, you will find ten thousand little eddies in it), voiceless, swift, with trim banks, thro&#x2019; the heart of Europe, and of the Middle Ages wedded to the Present Age: such an image of calm <hi rend="italic">power</hi> (to say nothing of its other properties) I find I had never seen before. The old Cities too are a little beautiful to me, in spite of my state of nerves; honest kindly people too, but sadly short of our and your <hi rend="italic">despatch-of-business</hi> talents,&#x2014;a really painful defect in the long run. I was on two of Fritz&#x2019;s Battlefields, moreover: Lobositz in Bohemia, and Cunersdorf by Frankfurt on the Oder: but did not, especially in the latter case, make much of that. Schiller&#x2019;s death-chamber, Goethe&#x2019;s sad Court-environment; above all, Luther&#x2019;s little room in the <hi rend="italic">Wartburg</hi> (I believe I actually had tears in my eyes there, and <hi rend="italic">kissed</hi> the old oak-table, being in a very flurried state of nerves), my belief was that under the Canopy there was not at present so <hi rend="italic">holy</hi> a spot as that same. Of human souls I found none specially beautiful to me at all,&#x2014;such my sad fate! Of learned <pb id="pg-28-138" n="28:138"/>professors, I saw little; and that little was more than enough. Tieck at Berlin an old man, lame on a sofa, I did love, and do;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC did not yet know that Tieck had d., <date when="1853-04-28">28 April</date>.</note> he is an exception, could I have seen much of him. But on the whole, <hi rend="italic">Universal Puseyism</hi> seemed to me the humour of German, especially of Berlin, thinkers;&#x2014;and I had some quite portentous specimens of that kind,&#x2014;unconscious specimens of 400 quack power! Truly and really the Prussian soldiers, with their intelligent <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>, with the touches of effective Spartanism I saw or fancied in them, were the class of people that pleased me best.&#x2014; &#x2014; But see my sheet is out!

<p>I do not very well understand what your proposal is; not having known anything at all of the <hi rend="italic">Railway Reading</hi> till now.

The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1853-03-05">5 March</date>, found it &#x201C;one of those elegant agreeable little tracts now so plentifully provided.&#x201C; Chapman must have proposed that TC be pbd. in this series.</note> For the rest, I should consider it greatly preferable, both for me and what readers I may have, to come forth on a basis of my own, in the Railway Stalls or elsewhere.</p>
<p>However, here is Bosworth&#x2019;s Letter,&#x2014;not so munificent an offer, after all, now that I come to look at it thro&#x2019; the Cocker spectacles: 6000 at 2/6, if we take the fifth penny for the Author&#x2019;s behoof&#x2014;?&#x2014;I answered Bosworth, I should be happy to treat with him about it, if he could get your consent.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have not written to you so speedily as usual, I know not well why. Perhaps that these bleak spring winds have disheartened me a little more than the average. I did firmly mean to write today; but absolutely could not while at home (<hi rend="italic">time</hi> was so far gone); so I have fled in hither, to do it here <foreign><hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi></foreign> [anyway at all]; better than not at all.</p>
<p>My poor Mother I can see is in a very weakly way: no wonder amid these sad blasts of barren sunless weather. Daily &#x26; almost hourly she is in my mind; the sad thought about her is never fairly away. Continue, I pray you, to do for her what you can contrive;&#x2014;I know you will and do; and that is a great alleviation to my sad feelings on the subject. And contrive too to give me news on that subject; the <hi rend="italic">true</hi> state of it ought to be visible to me thro&#x2019; what you write. I sent a Letter to my Mother this week, and a <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> since, with some other rags of pamphlets, which I fear she will not be able to read. Alas, I can do <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> for her here!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane continues going about; but complains considerably of the hardness of the weather and its effects upon her. I am sorry but not surprised to find <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Missus is also a little under the same liabilities. Good weather <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be here soon; that certainly is a safe prophecy now.</p>
<p>Our Street, Cheyne Row, is such a mess of rubbish and devastation for these last 3 weeks as you never saw! They are building a Sewer in it, 20 or more feet under ground, a grand work indeed; and from end to end is nothing but heaped rubbish, navvies &#x26;c running, bricklayers building in the bowels of the Earth night and day,&#x2014;and nobody can get out of his door except by a path of 18 inches, if even a path at all. Ten days of it yet are the least I look for. Patientia.</p>
<p>I heard from Emerson; meant to send you his Letter, and will. Item from Clough,&#x2014;who has got an appoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, and I suppose is coming home. The <hi rend="italic">Glen</hi> case (of which you heard?) <hi rend="italic">is</hi> now under Lord Aberdeen&#x2019;s consideration, Duke of Argyll &#x26;c supporting it; goodish <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>, but not to be decided till &#x201C;the end of <date when="1853-06">june</date>.&#x201C;&#x2014; Is Dr Hunter still with you? My respects if so. There is happily no <hi rend="italic">if</hi> in Phoebe&#x2019;s case; therefore&#x2014;!&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother.</salute></closer></p>

<p>You did not come to see me according to your promise and intention; which fact costs us, among other losses, the trouble of this Letter; for I had a question to put to you, which I did not recollect while at the Athenaeum.</p>

Quintus Icilius, German soldier and writer, who served under Frederick in the Seven Years War; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18: 26&#x2013;29.</note>&#x2014;upon whose Book, <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires militaires sur les Grecs et les Romains</hi> (Hague, <date when="1757">1757</date>, 2v. 4<hi rend="italic">to</hi>) I should like very well to hear your opinion, had you ever thought of looking into it or forming an opinion, some day or other. That, however, is not the present question; the present question is of Guichard&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">nickname</hi> merely.</p>
<p>It seems, the learned marching Captain, having offered his services, after writing this Book, to King Fritz, and been accepted; came, about the beginning of <date when="1758">1758</date>, to Breslau where the said Fritz was; and being a man of intelligence was frequently admitted to a long evening talk with the King,&#x2014;about the Battle of Pharsalia,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pharsalia, NE Greece, <date>48 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>, where Julius Caesar defeated Pompey&#x2019;s vastly superior forces.</note> the Tenth Legion, and a world of other kindred topics. In regard to the Tenth Legion and Battle of Pharsalia, and especially to the sublime exploit of a certain Centurion in that Legion, which had as usual the extreme right for its position there, and did, by its dexterous Centurion, and something they call the <foreign><hi rend="italic">schiefe Stellung</hi></foreign> (&#x201C;oblique order,&#x201C; suddenly assumed),&#x2014;give Pompey an ugly slap on the face:&#x2014;in regard to this, I say, Fritz and the new Captain were emphatic in their admiration; and Fritz said, &#x201C;This Quintus <hi rend="italic">C&#xe6;cilius</hi> must have been a first-rate fellow.&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Pardon me, your Majesty, his name was Quintus <hi rend="italic">Icilius</hi>,&#x2014;the name of that clever Centurion of the Tenth Legion at the Battle of Pharsalia!&#x201C;</p>
<p>&#x2014;Some argument hereupon; but next day Guichard produced &#x201C;the Book&#x201C; (which!), and the name was found actually to be Qu Icilius. &#x201C;Well, yours shall be Quintus Icilius, too,&#x201C; said F<hi rend="italic">k</hi>, who did not usually own himself wrong and beaten in such cases, but was wont to ride off on any broomstick he could clutch: &#x201C;You are Q. Icilius!&#x201C;&#x2014;<supplied>[T]</supplied>his is a <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, for Guichard himself told it to Nicolai, the most authentic of men. And another fact is that, in a few weeks afterwards, a new appointment of a &#x201C;Major Quintus Icilius&#x201C; appeared upon the Prussian Order Books,&#x2014;somewhat to the wonder of several, but uncontradictible by any;&#x2014;and &#x201C;Quintus Icilius,&#x201C; the name <hi rend="italic">Guichard</hi> quite extinguished, did feats of arms (especially of <hi rend="italic">plunder</hi>, on an occasion), and continued very conspicuous about Sans-Souci till his death long after the War was done.</p>
<p>And now after this long preamble comes my question to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. Nicolai cannot find this Centurion Quintus in any old Book,&#x2014;nor can I (even if I tried!);&#x2014;and the question is, Do you know anything about such a Centurion, &#x26; such a feat, in the Battle of Pharsalia?</p>
<p>Nicolai, in his whole survey of Ancient History, finds only 3 Iciliuses, two in <pb id="pg-28-143" n="28:143"/>Livy, one in Appian: Spurius Icilius (Livy 1. &#x03C0;, c. 58), Lucius d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> (Virginia&#x2019;s man, Livy III, 44); and Publius d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, one of the Proscribed after Caesar&#x2019;s death (Appianus, <hi rend="italic">Bello Civili</hi>, IV. 27):<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Livy (<date>59 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>&#x2013;<date when="0017"><hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi> 17</date>), historian, author of 
<hi rend="italic">The History of Rome</hi>. Appian, Greek historian (<date><hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi> 2nd cent.</date>), author of <hi rend="italic">Roma&#xEF; ca</hi>, a history of Rome. Julius Caesar (<date>100</date>&#x2013;<date>44 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), author of <hi rend="italic">De Bello Civili</hi> [On the Civil War].</note> Nicolai has tried, and can do no more. The story of Guichard is told in a hundred other German Books; but none, except Nicolai, has even tried to get at the bottom of it.&#x2014; In this condition it arrives at Bury St Edmunds; with a new hope lighting its poor dim old eyes.</p>
<p>If you can without much trouble settle this matter, it is really a thing which Scholarship <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to have done; and as German Scholarship (blinded by Academic tobacco and other sad causes) has never seen the problem, let English now try it!&#x2014; For the rest, I need not say, it is not a <hi rend="italic">great</hi> question, alas no! But I will leave it with you, making no apologies; and send you another too, if another arise.</p>

<p>There is some proposal to reprint just now, for the benefit of Uncle Tom and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, that <hi rend="italic">Lecture on the Nigger Question</hi>, which distressed the world, thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>, a couple of years ago.</p>

<p><pb id="pg-28-145" n="28:145"/>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s flat nose would really be much better for a seasonable fillip in these extravagant days: but I could wish any other than I had been appointed for that outpost duty!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Thanks, in the name of the small &#x201C;suffering remnant&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;So the Cameronians called themselves in Claverhouse&#x2019;s time&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351223-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>8:272</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1835-12-23">23 Dec. 1835</date></corr></ref>). For John Graham of Claverhouse; See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520802-TC-JAC-01"><sic>27:198</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1852-08-02">2 Aug. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> of studious souls in this country! If you and the Chancellor<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gladstone.</note> can take away that heavy aggravation from the price of good old Continental Books, you will accomplish a real benefit, and a thing creditable to both of you.</p>
<p>But I much fear it cannot be yet done by this method; or in fact without <hi rend="italic">abrogating the foolish Book duty altogether</hi>. The present <hi rend="italic">charge</hi> on Old Books is but an insignificant trifle; the real aggravation consists in the necessity of having every Book <hi rend="italic">examined</hi> (on the Continent, first of all), fixed into its Customhouse <hi rend="italic">class</hi> by stamp, &#x26;c &#x26;c; and in the consequent necessity of having agents; at Leipzig and elsewhere, to dun the officials, and get all this performed before the Book can sail:&#x2014;for example, my last Foreign Book, <hi rend="italic">Friedrich&#x2019;s Works</hi>, some 30 volumes (<date when="1788">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792">92</date>), was bought for me at Leipzig according to the Catalogue price for about 9/; and, laid down here at Chelsea, it cost 35&#x2018;/,&#x2014;of which the <hi rend="italic">carriage</hi> might cost perhaps about 2/ (in Prussia it could have been carried, <hi rend="italic">by post</hi>, an equal distance for that sum, and <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are now getting a kind of <hi rend="italic">supplementary</hi> conveyance to reach, if not St Martin&#x2019;s, yet Regent&#x2019;s Circus on similar terms); the Queen&#x2019;s dues here, I really do not think above 1/6&#x2014;and upwards of a <hi rend="italic">guinea</hi> spent on mere Boeotian<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The inhabitants of Boeotia in ancient Greece were proverbial for their stupidity.</note> Botheration! Is not that a thing flagrant; well <hi rend="italic">worthy</hi> of abolition by two men of sense that have got it by the neck? I pray you cut it <hi rend="italic">home</hi>, and see you do not send it off with a mere scratch which will suffer it to live all the same!&#x2014;</p>
<p>As I said, the new Books published in Germany or elsewhere at present, are not a care to me, are the reverse of a care; but if the others cannot be delivered except in their company, then clearly let the whole be delivered. I find we must go to the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of the whole tether in regard to &#x201C;liberty of the press&#x201C; here in England, in these blessed days; <hi rend="italic">we</hi> must try it to the very <pb id="pg-28-146" n="28:146"/>uttermost (such is the irreversible <foreign><hi rend="italic">Plebisscitum</hi></foreign><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> [decree of the People] just now), and see whether wisdom and salvation do lie in that,&#x2014;and not in something infinitely different from that, by and by! This of Foreign Books, and absolute <hi rend="italic">Freedom</hi> of the Book Trade every way, is the natural codicil to such sublime universal determination of the English People;&#x2014;and it will come with a good grace from the hands it now depends on; and I really hope the Chancellor and you will do it, now that you are at it. If you made a Law to cheapen Old Foreign Books, and did not cheapen them perceptibly at all,&#x2014;how should you like it!</p>
<p>At all events, consult Williams &#x26; Norgate (Henrietta Street), also Nutt (Fleet-Street), on the subject,&#x2014;or employ me to rally those about you with their admonitions;&#x2014;and see that you discern fully what your Law will <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, before passing it;&#x2014;and do not botch this fine business, but turn it off in a state to hold water!</p>

<salute>Dear Foreign Lady,</salute>
<p>There is no &#x201C;wet day,&#x201C; nor any likelihood that I can see of your writing to me, in which sad case, what is there for us but the <hi rend="italic">next</hi>-best? I got no news at Bath House either; except that you had gone on from the Boulogne regions next day, probably as harbinger; and that Lord A., who was <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> (at Bath House) to be a little better, would follow straightway, so soon as you had found a proper lodgement for him? Some way or other, I hope it is all right at present; and fancy you sauntering about in that big Bandbox,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Paris.</note> under the few Spring leaves it has, under this bright sun;&#x2014;and send many a blessing after the brightest Foreign Lady there now is.&#x2014;London,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">partly</hi> perhaps owing to the Whitsuntide Holidays,&#x2014;is wonderfully <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> in the fashionable regions, ever since you went;&#x2014;not a carriage to be seen, by Nero and me, yesternight in Belgravia; only rackets enough, and a distracting torrent of dirty cabs &#x26;c, when we got into the Cremorne regions<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520909-TC-JWC-01"><sic>27:273</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1852-09-09">9 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> again. Do you really mean to snap <pb id="pg-28-147" n="28:147"/>your tether, then, and &#x201C;go to the South&#x201C; for good? If you do, where are we! It is true we have almost nothing to offer you,&#x2014;alas, perhaps almost less than nothing;&#x2014;and the very weather threatens to be too <hi rend="italic">hot</hi> (as bad as too cold), when you come back. Nevertheless, nevertheless&#x2014;!&#x2014; On the whole, you won&#x2019;t break your tether, my Lady; and mustn&#x2019;t, &#x201C;the effectual fervent prayer&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James 5:16.</note> of a few righteous persons, or even of one, will plead for monstrous England (poor luckless Caliban<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Tempest</hi>.</note> that it is), and prevail with the Powers and you!</p>
<p>Meanwhile I despatched your Letter to Clough,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530512-TC-AHC-01">TC to AHC, <date when="1853-05-12">12 May</date></ref>.</note> with an advice to rejoice over it, and come home directly. Two days before, there had come, from C. himself, a very pleasant, sketchy, cheerful, semi-satirical little Letter; which I might have forwarded today, only it is not at hand for the moment, but gone into nearer Clough circles. From the Darwin side of things Jane, on speaking of your Granville achievement, learned that it would be precious news to one young lady of their acquaintance;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blanche Smith.</note> said young lady was just consulting the Darwin side of things on this question,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not explained. Clough had written to her, <date when="1853-01-17">17 Jan.</date>, about TC&#x2019;s efforts: &#x201C;Ld John is very likely to make room for Ld Clarendon, and Ld Clarendon is an ally of the Ashburtons. But&#x2014;but&#x2014;but&#x2014;and for some reasons I would almost rather you came here&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Clough</hi> 2:366).</note> &#x201C;Whether a young female of sensibility could not at once go out to Boston, and bear a hand in the romance of <hi rend="italic">keeping School</hi> there,&#x2014;with an accomplished young philosopher and instructor of youth?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; Poor little soul, one really grants her this immense temporary happiness! For once in your life, my Lady, I must admit you have, considering all sides of it, done a pretty thing. And as I said of your Letters, such things are apt to be rarer with you than with the generality. There is one however!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane has gone off, this day, to be with the Sterling girls (out at a pretty place near Reigate) till Saturday:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Headley Grove Farm; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480609-TC-JT-01"><sic>23:42</sic><corr>TC to JT, <date when="1848-06-09">9 June 1848</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490219-TC-JF-01"><sic>237</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1849-02-19">19 Feb. 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note> Nero too is gone, and except for a judicious black Cat, I am left quite alone.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here is already too long delay in writing; and I will not go out again with nothing in my pocket for you. A few words of news: alas, it is all I can do for my good old Mother; and a right welcome and pious duty and privilege at once! But one&#x2019;s time goes at a sad rate in this wild whirl of things; and goes so often in doing what one does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> want, instead of what one does.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-149" n="28:149"/>Jamie&#x2019;s small Letter was a great and welcome blessing to me: I have since heard from the Doctor too:&#x2014;and now here is actual <hi rend="italic">summer</hi> at last; and I trust my dear Mother is participating in it, and sensibly alleviated by the absence of those harsh outer elements. For 3 days now we have had the beautifullest May weather, real <hi rend="italic">May</hi> at last; the wind is still easterly, but from the <hi rend="italic">southern</hi> quarter as well, and not too much of it, with plenty of sun: if I could keep it from growing any warmer, that were just the sort for me: I have down my window blinds (the inner, not yet the <hi rend="italic">outer</hi> which are ready), and today I have put off my fire. I expect to profit a little by this good change; and hope really it will do us all good.</p>
<p>Jane is gone off this forenoon (Wednesday) to visit the Sterling Girls (<hi rend="italic">&#x2018;John&#x2019;s</hi> Daughters) who, with their eldest Brother now a <hi rend="italic">farmer</hi> and 21 years old, are living at a nice country place called Headley; and have long been asking her out. For they are all very great with her, poor things; especially the second girl, Kate, who is a very brilliant clever lady, and like her Father in turn of mind,&#x2014;and a beauty withal. Anthony Sterling, the Uncle, having such <hi rend="italic">a Wife</hi>, was glad to get them placed out there. It is about 20 miles off; railway, and they were to meet her at the Station. She stays till Saturday, <hi rend="italic">Nero</hi> &#x26; she; and I think it will be really pleasant for her, and do her some good to see the green budding country again, and be out of all these noises.&#x2014; As for me, I &#x201C;abide by the stuff&#x201C;: if I could but manage to get a little work forward: but alas, that prospers very ill with me at present, much as I try! And in fact there is literally nothing else worth trying, or worth prospering in: I find that more and more.</p>
<p>Redwood, my Welsh friend, was here last night; rather deafish, very earnest, very friendly: poor soul, Jane gave him tea; and I recommended&#x2014;to buy a pair of spectacles for one thing, as his eyes too were failing!&#x2014; Glen&#x2019;s case, it is understood, goes on favourably; and I shall be disappointed if some little thing do not come out of it for the poor widow, in a month and half: &#x201C;end of <date when="1853-06">june</date>,&#x201C; is their term set. I got a very kind answer from the Duke of Argyll, to whom I had written on the matter; he promises to support the Petition as far as he can, really in a hearty-looking way: I sent the Note to Mrs Glen, that she might read it (in silence) and burn it. I have likewise written to two other Grandees, Lords Breadalbane &#x26; Albemarle;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Thomas Keppel (<date when="1799">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891">1891</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15442"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 6th earl of Albemarle.</note>&#x2014;and this, I believe, is about all I can do in the matter, and will now patiently wait. Lord Stanley, I see, has some little hope about it, tho&#x2019; he is a sceptical hard-tongued man, and his <hi rend="italic">bark</hi> worse than his bite always. Very clever and shrewd, however. He had said to his wife one day (as she told me), &#x201C;The chief ground after all will be that Carlyle is so intent upon it!&#x201C; which is a great encouragement to Carlyle to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> intent enough, then! I shall rejoice sincerely to be of any benefit to poor <pb id="pg-28-150" n="28:150"/>Mrs Glen for her own and her Husband&#x2019;s sake, with the worth in them both that was known to me of old.</p>
<p>The Bookseller Chapman (urged by <hi rend="italic">another</hi> that was offering!) will now proceed to publish some of my best &#x201C;Essays&#x201C; (from the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>) as <hi rend="italic">Railway</hi> Books &#x201C;a shilling each&#x201C;; probably about 10 in all; which will gradually bring me in some hard cash again (&#xa3;200 when the thing is all executed) and afford <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> readers a chance at reading something of that strange monster they have long heard of! Which is well.</p>
<p>Our Ham is now <hi rend="italic">done:</hi> two of the <hi rend="italic">best hams</hi> ever eaten,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; we began them too soon! Thanks to the kind Givers once more. Young Jamie I suppose is gone back to Glasgow: I suppose too Scotsbrig is a very busy place to the Husbandman in these fine days.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Give my love to all, old and young;&#x2014;take care of yourself, dear Mother! I will write again in a few days. Your <hi rend="italic">bad <foreign>bairn</foreign></hi></salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your two Notes have come; thank you for all the care you take of me in that respect. I am very anxious about poor Jean;&#x2014;not specifically apprehensive, but very desirous to have more news. I shall perhaps get something farther tonight; having written off immediately to James Aitken after your Note came. Yesterday morning, of somewhat later date than yours, I did get a short word from him, &#x201C;Jean still continuing to do well&#x201C; and the &#x201C;Doctor Scott<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Scott, Castle St., Dumfries.</note> only afraid she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get well too fast&#x201C; (which I did not quite understand): but I hope there will good news come for me tonight! This is certainly not a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> state to be in, this of poor Jean&#x2019;s; and I have always vaguely understood it to be a dangerous phenomenon, this which has now twice occurred with her. We will hope the best!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My poor Mother, I can expect, will be profiting a little; for we have now <pb id="pg-28-152" n="28:152"/>excellent summer weather, which, I suppose, extends to your parts too: winds <hi rend="italic">south</hi>-easterly, and very light, with plenty of sun, and already almost too much heat for those that have to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi>, in the middle hours of the day. Very pleasant weather here indeed;&#x2014;and our street still choked with Chaos (tho&#x2019; now getting filled up actually, in spite of Whit-Monday<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A holiday in England.</note> and its gin); likely not to be clear and <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> for a ten days to come. The cutting now extends into Cook&#x2019;s grounds as well: it seems, there are to be streets &#x26;c there;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510605-JWC-HW-01"><sic>26:84</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1851-06-05">5 June 1851</date></corr></ref>.</note> the old (French-Huguenot, Chelsea-China &#x26;c) Chapel is to vanish, the Bishop &#x26; Kingsley <hi rend="italic">won&#x2019;t</hi> have it rebuilt on their premises.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles James Blomfield (<date when="1786">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857">1857</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2668"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), bishop of London, <date when="1828">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856">56</date>.

TC must have been writing about the 13th-century Chelsea Old Church, still in existence. It became the Parish Chapel under the <date when="1819">1819</date> act for the building of St. Luke&#x2019;s, the new parish church. There was an inscription in the nave to the memory of the owner of the Chelsea China Works, Francis Thomas (<date when="1725">1725</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1770">70</date>). Chelsea China was manufactured ca. <date when="1745">1745</date> to <date when="1769">1769</date>. The works were demolished in <date when="1784">1784</date>. The Huguenots Jean Cavalier (<date when="1681">1681</date>&#x2013;<date when="1750">1750</date>) and Capt. Rieutort are buried in the churchyard.</note> For the rest, our sublime <hi rend="italic">drain</hi>, it now appears, is not ours at all; intended for <hi rend="italic">Kensington</hi>, or we know not what; and only the boring and building of it is to be ours. Alas, for the mortar-tub; not Chelsea only but this whole generation, in all its interests, is got fairly flung into the mortar-tub; and will have to puddle there till long after we are out of it! Never mind.</p>
<p>Jane has gone out to Headley to the Sterling Girls, day before yesterday, and does not return till tomorrow; in which interval I am perfectly solitary,&#x2014;but do not get on with much work either. I am quite dreadfully incompetent and indisposed for real work,&#x2014;woe&#x2019;s me,&#x2014;and cannot get on with it at all, this sad year! My strength is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> quite equal to my burden, I often fear; nevertheless we will try,&#x2014;still try if we cannot (like my Father) &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">gar</hi> ourselves do it.&#x201C;&#x2014; My difficulties with <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>k are two: first, the vague <hi rend="italic">shore</hi>less nature of the subject, which has been treated hitherto by hardly any man of superior understanding, and lies &#x201C;like water spilt upon the ground&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 Sam. 14:14.</note> (hardly to be gathered up here at Chelsea, I doubt): second, what is still worse, the want of sufficient <hi rend="italic">love</hi> for lean Frederic &#x26; his heroisms, on my part,&#x2014;which is a sad objection indeed! Only pain can now <hi rend="italic">drive</hi> me thro&#x2019; the subject; <hi rend="italic">led</hi> and induced thro&#x2019; it I shall never be. I tremble at the thought of such &#x201C;drivings&#x201C; as I have known before now.</p>
<p>Bosworth (215 Regent Street) applied for leave to reprint in <hi rend="italic">Railway</hi> form some of my Essays; answer from Chapman, &#x201C;No,&#x201C;&#x2014;but determination by Chapman now to do it himself at last. &#x201C;Biographical Essays&#x201C;; about 10 of them in all; begin with <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>, which I have now got, and am correcting for <pb id="pg-28-153" n="28:153"/>the shilling-pamphlet artists. 3000 copies, and to me &#xa3;20 for each shilling-pamphlet: fair enough on the money side. Bosworth, at present, wants to print the &#x201C;Occasional Discourse on the Nigger Question&#x201C; (to astonish the <hi rend="italic">Uncle-Tommery</hi> a little); but that I find questionable hitherto,&#x2014;the Piece itself (as I see today) is very imperfect, in parts bad; and the &#x201C;cry of stuck pigs&#x201C; which is sure to follow from it (and is not a musical thing) will be great. I doubt, I doubt.&#x2014; Jeffs the Foreign Bookseller &#x201C;applies for an interview&#x201C;; some Fr<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Publisher intends a Translation of <hi rend="italic">F</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Revol</hi>n <hi rend="italic">a History:</hi> very well,&#x2014;if he can find a Fr<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Translator!

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>A little Note from John, two little Notes, confirmed what young Jamie had reported of you; and gave me great satisfaction, and relief from many anxieties. <pb id="pg-28-155" n="28:155"/>I still flatter myself you are now a good bit fresher, in this fine summer weather: for now at last we have got summer and no mistake,&#x2014;the weather warm enough, and almost too warm! We have laid off all our winter clothes &#x26;c here, and are stripping ourselves barer and barer every day. I suppose there will be some new plunge of rain before long (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> indeed is much needed) and the temperature will fall again when the sun is hid: but in the meanwhile there is not likely to be any defect of <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> again for some time. I hope you profit by it, dear Mother; tho&#x2019; I cannot say it has yet done much for me; but indeed here in the Town, in these <hi rend="italic">dusty</hi> circumstances, it has not yet had a fair chance.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Navvies</hi> &#x26;c are never away out of our street yet; and we are now getting heartily tired of them. They work by <hi rend="italic">the day</hi>, I have often thought, and not by the piece! Such trailing and wheeling to and fro, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">ploutering</hi></foreign> and puddling! Their big chasm is all filled in, to the top of the street, or at least a great way past our door; but no wheel-carriage yet gets into us, and mounds of gravel &#x26;c lie about everywhere. Our next neighbour is up in Town, this very day, pricking them into greater speed.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have myself been rather busier of late; and have every day got something <hi rend="italic">done;</hi> which indeed is the one solid comfort I have in the world. When nothing will go forward with me, as has been too often the case this long while, I get very disconsolate, and am disposed to say, What is the use of me at all!&#x2014;My present job is no great things: only getting ready some bits of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Reprints</hi>&#x201C; which the Booksellers are about making from my <hi rend="italic">Essays:</hi> &#x201C;Reading for Railways,&#x201C; or some such title, they call the bits of Pamphlets,&#x2014;1/ each;&#x2014;of which I think I told you last time. The poor job is pretty well on now.</p>
<p>No certain news about Mrs Glen&#x2019;s case yet: her son wrote to me the other day again; but there was little to be answered: only I know the thing is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sleeping; and I still pretty confidently hope some little result will come out of it.</p>
<p>Poor Maccall has started lecturing; Jane has been twice to hear him. The Lectures, she declares, were excellent,&#x2014;eloquent and what not:&#x2014;but, alas the <hi rend="italic">audiences</hi> hitherto are of the smallest, and no money at all can lie in them! Jane <hi rend="italic">raised</hi> some forces to go and hear, last time; and has got two people to send <hi rend="italic">notices</hi> to the Newspapers (<hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> &#x26; <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> we hope will help a little. You will see the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> one (by a Mr Newman, brother of the <hi rend="italic">Pusey</hi> Newman), last week: the one for the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> was by Neuberg, and I am not sure it was not <hi rend="italic">too late</hi> for insertion.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both notices were unsigned. The one in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1853-05-28">28 May</date>, mentioned &#x201C;Among the novelties of <date when="1853-05">May</date> &#x2026; the Sunday addresses of Mr Maccall, who &#x2026; is delivering a course of philosophical, or (as the Germans might call them) religious lectures. / Mr Maccall&#x2019;s last lecture (22nd inst.) was entitled Development and Correspondence; from which no one could conjecture its real subject. In fact, it was an eloquent declamation of the Living Forces of Nature. He himself summed up his doctrine into the statement, that &#x2018;God is the Life of all things, but manifests himself solely in forms, and that, of all his forms known to us, Man is the noblest;&#x2019; hence true history, which is the record of man, is the <hi rend="italic">development</hi> of God. &#x2026; On <supplied>[the doctrine of Necessity]</supplied>, as on other parts of his subject, he vented many cutting vituperations, from which, he is well aware, a great majority of the thoughtful and well-informed dissent. Nevertheless, his originality, his peculiar eloquence, his purity of aim, and unquestionable sincerity, enable a hearer to receive from him without offence sentiments to which very few indeed can respond. To minds which feed only by the roadside, Mr Maccall offers no pasture; but to those who love the grass of untrodden paths and unopened fountains, and fear not the wild and perhaps virulant plants which may there be picked up, he will occasionally afford a stimulating and healthy nutriment.&#x201C; On Sunday, <date when="1853-05-29">29 May</date>, he was to speak on &#x201C;Symbolism.&#x201C; The <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>, <date when="1853-05-28">28 May</date>, said &#x201C;Mr. Maccall, &#x2026; in whom <supplied>[the]</supplied> spirit of religion is very active, striving for utterance, while the old phraseology has become dead and unprofitable to him, has chosen this platform to speak for the truth that is in him,&#x201C; and &#x201C;his utterances, such as they are, strike us as those of a thoughtful, sincere, studious mind, who must have had much silent wrestlings before he came to speak. &#x2026; Mr. Maccall&#x2019;s audience, though not numerous, is, as far as we were able to judge, extremely select, and consists mainly of the &#x2018;cultivated&#x2019; classes.&#x201C; Francis Newman, John Henry Newman&#x2019;s brother.</note> Poor Maccall deserves considerable <pb id="pg-28-156" n="28:156"/>sympathy; I wish only he were not so rashly <hi rend="italic">heterodox</hi> as he is! I do not see a smooth road ahead of him at all; but he must <foreign><hi rend="italic">scraffle</hi></foreign> along.</p>
<p>Jane came back no worse from her Sterling jaunt: I was very glad to see her again; being lonely enough in the interim, and my Irish maid not the best of Housemothers. We were a good deal concerned to heart<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> of poor Jean&#x2019;s adventure, and do not like these repeated mischances: however, she seems to be doing well herself, this time again; and that is a great relief to my imagination for the present.&#x2014; Yesterday was &#x201C;Whitsunday&#x201C; in Scotland, and there would be a great topsyturvying there! Here it is no <hi rend="italic">term;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Scottish quarter day, one of the term days for removals and engaging servants.

<p>I am strongly inclined to be of opinion that you should not quite neglect to look about you over those estates offered for sale, and see whether you could not tolerably fit yourself with a pleasant rural habitation, where you might learn to farm a little, and trim up once more a house for yourself on the face of this &#x2018;all-nourishing earth.&#x2019; Depend upon it, as matters go, that is a considerable point for a man; to be anchored even by the possession of a house, a library, a dairy, garden, and good conveniences for <hi rend="italic">living</hi> whatever life one may have&#x2014;this is greatly preferable to no anchorage at all. As to England, you could still visit England <foreign><hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi></foreign> after a little while, and if you have quite done with trade (as I suppose to be certain), there really is very little in England that cannot be overtaken by visits. I have serious thoughts myself, many a time, of fairly lifting anchor out of this empty noise, and steering towards some discoverable habitation that were at least silent, and furnished with <hi rend="italic">not</hi> dirty air to breathe. Age is, and should be, earnest, sad even, though not ignobly but nobly sad; and the empty, grinning apery of commonplace creatures and their loud inanities ought to be more and more shut out from us as the Eternities draw nigh. You, in your own thoughts, may find occupation for yourself wherever you are; and whether the world takes any notice of it or takes no notice, is really not the question with a man. &#x2026; I hear in some <pb id="pg-28-158" n="28:158"/>vague way&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;is gaining large vogue for some Swedish &#x2018;muscular&#x2019; or other half-distracted form of &#x2018;medicine&#x2019; he has taken in hand.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably J.

From Louvain he sent a long self-justification (<date when="1613-09-08">8 Sept. 1613</date>) with copies of Bruce&#x2019;s challenges, frequently copied and first pbd., <date when="1713">1713</date>.</note> I suppose I must have sent him the volume of my poor old <hi rend="italic">Collins&#x2019;s Peerage</hi>, where that Transaction is recorded, and the &#x201C;Letters&#x201C; &#x26;c (all the Letters I ever saw on the subject), together wth Lord Edward&#x2019;s Narrative are given.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Collins, <hi rend="italic">Peerage of England</hi> (<date when="1709">1709</date>; definitive edn., 9 vols., <date when="1812">1812</date>) 2:131&#x2013;37.</note> As Hartmann is a Bohemian, I most likely would mention farther that Lord Edward was <hi rend="italic">at</hi> the Battle of Prag (or King&#x2019;s Sunday-Dinner <hi rend="italic">during</hi> the Battle, I don&#x2019;t now remember which), and that in the sad scramble which closed that Dinner party, he had to take the Queen of Bohemia <foreign><hi rend="italic">en croupe</hi></foreign> [on the saddle behind him], and so gallop with her the best he could;&#x2014;which fact also I had read in the Old Books somewhere, and find still sticking to me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sackville was one of the commanders of the 2,000 volunteers sent to help Friedrich (<date when="1596">1596</date>&#x2013;<date when="1632">1632</date>), king of Bohemia, and was at the battle of Prague, <date when="1620-11-08">8 Nov. 1620</date>. Friedrich m., <date when="1613">1613</date>, Elizabeth, da. of James I of England and VI of Scotland. They were supposedly dining with two British ambassadors at the time of the battle. Apparently Elizabeth left Prague by coach after the defeat but for part of the journey rode pillion with Capt. Ralph Hopton (<date when="1598">1598</date>&#x2013;<date when="1652">1652</date>).</note> But this is all I ever <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have told Hartmann; and this is but little: of any connexion between that Duel and the Queen of Bohemia&#x2019;s History I never heard or dreamt.</p>
<p>Some seven years I did make a good deal of dreary investigation into that old Story; noting down whatever I could find about Bruce and Sackville: but really in the end it amounted to nothing but what is familiar to you already: the wet meadow after dinner, the &#x26;c &#x26;c. I found it certain that they had been intimate companions a year or two before; but as to what the cause of their <pb id="pg-28-159" n="28:159"/>deadly quarrel was, I got no light, except what common tradition gives, nor do I think there will any ever be got. I have inquired of the <hi rend="italic">Elgin</hi> Bruces,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The family of James Bruce (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863">63</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3737"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 8th earl of Elgin, collateral descendants of the 2nd Baron Bruce.</note> who claim to be representatives; but they also know nothing. Why should they? Young gentlemen do quarrel, and get into a very deadly humour with one another, now and then! The point that struck me most of all, was poor Bruce&#x2019;s last life-movement: when the Surgeon in a paroxysm of pity and rage was about drawing his sword on L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Edward, Bruce again opens his eyes, with these last words to him, &#x201C;Villain, hold thy hand!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Hartmann (who is a beautiful youth, with sumptuous beard, of the Hebrew race, and not without talent), I understand, is again in Town,&#x2014;beard as sumptuous as ever. I surely am obliged to him for the pleasure he has procured me on this occasion; <closer><salute>and remain,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear good Mother,&#x2014;</salute>My time is utterly run out today (drudging in sad <hi rend="italic">clerk</hi> work, over some Books &#x26;c), but I will not go without a word to you, lest you fancy something wrong.</p>
<p>We are well enough, and very busy; Jane is talking seriously of a visit <hi rend="italic">to Moffat</hi> about the end of this month! I think it will really do her good; and believe (pretty much) she <hi rend="italic">will</hi> go.&#x2014; John has written us two welcome little Notes about you,&#x2014;but you seem to be still in a very feeble way, alas. And the weather has grown quite cold again; since Monday we have not seen the sun, nothing but chill Northwind, and pretty strong too: today there are <hi rend="italic">blinks</hi> of sun from time to time, no change yet in the wind. Me it suits very well, this kind of weather; but poor <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, and people that cannot walk!&#x2014; We must <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> it will mend soon.</p>
<p>John Gordon was with us last night; very cheerful, but older than I ever saw him: the Northwind had puckered his skin, and <hi rend="italic">shewn</hi> his years better. He tells me, poor Wilson (the great Professor, writer in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> &#x26;c) is thought to be dying;&#x2014;ill of <hi rend="italic">palsy</hi> this some time, and now <hi rend="italic">worse</hi>. He was a big strong man; body and mind <hi rend="italic">big</hi> enough: but not very wise in his ways of life.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC later withdrew some of his criticisms of Wilson; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 414.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; Maccall, last Lecture, had 50; which is a great increase! Nothing farther heard of the <hi rend="italic">Glen</hi> case. Mrs Glen (Gordon tells me) has a son and daughter with her (of the <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>, dead or living, he can say nothing, knows nothing); she lives in a goodish street; tried to get &#x201C;boarders,&#x201C; but could not,&#x2014;and will be <hi rend="italic">greatly</hi> relieved by even a small success to this Petition.&#x2014; &#x2014; I hope young Jamie has <hi rend="italic">decided</hi>, and <pb id="pg-28-160" n="28:160"/>for the best; I could not have advised him, other than the Dr did.&#x2014; Creep close into a warm place, dear Mother! I will write soon again. <closer><salute>Love to all.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Ever yours /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>The <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> is ready; and will come soon,&#x2014;I wish I had something <hi rend="italic">better</hi> along with it.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I was very glad of your little Note; there is always more <hi rend="italic">in</hi> your bit of paper than in any other that comes to me out of that or indeed out of most other regions. I will not leave you <hi rend="italic">till Scotsbrig</hi> for news; but send you a word which you may carry thither. Our good old Mother is very frail indeed; alas, alas, it is no wonder at her years: she is little out of my thoughts, during all this untowardly season. But we may hope she will now do a little better when the warm weather is come: she has <hi rend="italic">her</hi> trust set in a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> quarter, which does not fail anyone: that is a great comfort, and the one sure comfort in the matter for us all. Ah me, ah me! the <hi rend="italic">flesh</hi> is very weak;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 26:41, Mark 14:38.</note> and the world around us here is full of mysteries and awful certainties! Almighty Justice <hi rend="italic">reigns</hi>, &#x201C;God reigns&#x201C;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 47:8.</note> and that is all that we can say; we have to be <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, having said that.</p>
<p>I am very much relieved that you are out of your bad adventure: I was in real alarm about it, in my <hi rend="italic">feckless</hi> humour of mind;&#x2014;and you may depend on it, it is no good job for anybody! I beg very much you would <hi rend="italic">take care of yourself</hi>, and indeed I hope you will.</p>
<p>We are fagging along here, with the summer round us at last, and with the roaring tumult which that always brings in London. I think we, here at Chelsea, are rather more out of that latter element than usual, however. Neither of us, for example, has been troubled with Mrs Beecher Stowe at all; we have kept out of her foolish way without effort, and let the <hi rend="italic">Uncle tommery</hi> run its own muddy course at a safe distance from us. The rapping &#x201C;spirits&#x201C; (that does pass in scandal and contemptibility <supplied>[anything]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> I have ever heard), the &#x201C;turning tables&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1853-04-20">20 April</date>, reported a letter in the <hi rend="italic">Augsburgh Gazette</hi> that described the sensation caused by table-moving; further letters, with possible explanations, and on its associations with spirit rappings continued into <date when="1853-05">May</date> and <date when="1853-06">June</date>.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c: one is at times ashamed of the poor posterity of Adam, and very willing to stand aside till they have got <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with certain things!&#x2014;&#x2014;Our <hi rend="italic">sewer</hi>-men (to come close home) have never yet got out of <pb id="pg-28-161" n="28:161"/>sight; it is near a quarter of a year now since they broke ground, and the tail of their rubbish is not fairly away yet! I never saw such working: &#x201C;it is men appointed by the late Derby Government,&#x201C;&#x2014;a very melancholy set of men indeed; and they get their pay from London in general, which being an <hi rend="italic">anarchy</hi> of wheel within wheel, no man in particular has any power over them, only they have power to take money from every man, and fling dirt at the door of every man. &#x201C;Emancipation!&#x201C; My soul is filled with disgust and despair at the sight of so many chosen servants of the Devil who are already &#x201C;emancipated&#x201C;; and I long often that I had a horsewhip big enough to reach the back of such! But I have not, most clearly <hi rend="italic">not;</hi> so have but one duty in regard to them,&#x2014;to hold my peace, and steer <hi rend="italic">as</hi> clear of them as I can. A certain man called Chadwick,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edwin Chadwick (<date when="1800">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890">1890</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5013"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330924-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:450</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-09-24">24 Sept. 1833</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370423-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:187</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-04-23">23 April 1837</date></corr></ref>), sanitary reformer and commissioner on the General Board of Health, had struggled to introduce a constant water supply and an arterial drainage system in London, but the <date when="1852">1852</date> Water Act had taken away the board&#x2019;s responsibility for London&#x2019;s water. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1852-06-21">21 June 1852</date>, had accused the board of &#x201C;priggish quackery&#x201C; and &#x201C;importunate conceit.&#x201C; Further attacks had been made on Chadwick, early <date when="1853">1853</date>, after his system was blamed, on unreliable evidence, for a fever epidemic in Croydon, <date when="1852-11">Nov. 1852</date>.</note> here, has wanted, and struggled sore, for some 20 years, to bring clean water into London, and take away foul dirt from it: I saw him the other day; and he professes himself <hi rend="italic">beaten</hi>, has lost his health even; and London will have no clean water for a long time yet.</p>
<p>I am working these 3 or 4 days at absolute index-making; surrounded with paper-clippings and bits of wafer: one of the dreariest jobs; but needful to be done, for I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> get something out of this wretched <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi>, and that was an indispensable preliminary. I am far weaker than I used to be, all this year; and it does not proceed from <hi rend="italic">age</hi>, I think, either, but from the dreadful smashing I got last year in my travelling &#x26;c. I trace yet very little decay of strength (when my health is good), but a great decay of heart: &#x201C;What&#x2019;s ta use on&#x2019;t?&#x201C; It becomes more and more difficult to get the steam up.&#x2014; &#x2014; I will send <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> to Scotsbrig tomorrow; I hope you will find it there. <closer><salute>My love to every one there and with you.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept many thanks for the beautiful little volume you send me. I have read <hi rend="italic">Tamerton Church;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Tamerton Church-Tower and Other Poems</hi> (<date when="1853">1853</date>).</note> and had surely no difficulty in detecting a great deal <pb id="pg-28-162" n="28:162"/>of fine poetic light, and many excellent elements of valuable human faculty, in that delicate and brilliant little Piece; nor am I so intolerant as to give such qualities a stingy welcome on account of the vehicle they come in! I am glad of such in any vehicle. Nor in fact (except for my own private uses) do I take upon me to prescribe, or forbid, any particular kind of vehicle for them. Go on, and prosper,&#x2014;in what vehicle <hi rend="italic">you</hi> find, after due thought, to be the likeliest for you.</p>
<p>For the rest, I hope you mean to come and see me again. I am often at home in the evenings: 7 o&#x2019;clock, or a little after, is the time of Tea.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have read the Letters, and some part of the <hi rend="italic">Article:</hi> I find things are in an unsatisfactory condition between F<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Joseph Foxton (<date when="1807">1807</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1870">70</date>), lapsed Church of Wales clergyman (see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510116-TC-JN-01"><sic>26:18</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1851-01-16">16 Jan. 1851</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-26/ed-26-biographical-notes"><sic>294</sic><corr>26:biographical note</corr></ref>). Little is known of him, but he had written <hi rend="italic">Popular Christianity, its Transition and Probable Development</hi> (<date when="1844">1844</date>) and was to write <hi rend="italic">The Priesthood and the People</hi> (<date when="1862">1862</date>). The article discussed is untraced. From Foxton&#x2019;s letter to TC, Lion Hotel, Rhayader, <date when="1853-06-17">17 June</date>, it is clear that TC wrote to him on similar lines to this letter to Chapman. Foxton defended and explained his retreat to remote Wales: &#x201C;I am confused, nervous irritable &#x26; altogether out of joint. &#x2026; I feel, like a &#x2018;hurt wild duck,&#x2019; a perpetual longing to creep into some hedge for shelter until I am strong enough to fly again. (Perhaps you will say I am more like a &#x2018;poisoned rat in a hole.&#x2019;) There is one sentence in your note which furnishes me with some kind of excuse for disregarding the rest. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> confess a &#x2018;continual hankering <supplied>[to]</supplied> this hour&#x2019; after a &#x2018;life among the moors&#x2019; tho&#x2019; you have tried &#x26; found it wanting. If you,&#x2014;every way a &#x2018;strong man&#x2019; have this touch of the &#x2018;old Adam&#x2019; still lingering about you, you cannot much blame me for &#x2018;babbling o&#x2019; green fields.&#x2019; &#x2026; / I am afraid I am scribbling a great deal of nonsense, but you are wise enough to pardon it. This life <hi rend="italic">is</hi> not (<hi rend="italic">ought</hi> it to be?) made up altogether of Reason. A good deal of that wonderful thing called life, is as much the result of <hi rend="italic">unconscious</hi> growth as the leaves on a tree.&#x2014; Apropos of this matter&#x2014;Chapman writes that the religious direction of the &#x2018;Westminster&#x2019; is to be strictly that of Comte&#x2019;s Positivism&#x2014;which if true is (I think <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will say) but a small part of the truth of the great matter. He says that all the Great writers on his side&#x2014;Mills, Grote &#x26;c are above review writing &#x26; that he cannot depend on &#x2018;us youth.&#x2019; He admits the shortcomings of the review on religious questions &#x26; assigns this as the reason.&#x201C; Foxton hoped to see TC on his way to the French coast &#x201C;if we pass through London&#x201C; but his wife had &#x201C;a horror of sleeping in London amongst the bugs&#x201C; so they would probably go direct. His wife &#x201C;has got a new life out of your writings which she has been brooding over for the last 2 or 3 years. I hope I shall see you before long. I hope I shall see you before long. With kind remembrances to Mrs. Carlyle &#x2026; ever sincerely and affectionately yours.&#x201C; Mrs. Foxton unidentified further.</note> and you.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Article</hi>, it clearly appears to me, will not do in its present state: and yet the general tenor of it is probably <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, as conceived in the Writer&#x2019;s mind; and <pb id="pg-28-163" n="28:163"/>there are many good, lively and searching observations in it, which it might be profitable both for the W<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review and for the Public of England to be partakers of, just now. These, and in general the services and cooperation of F<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, I should be sorry that you lost.</p>
<p>At the same time, it must be owned, this Article, consisting wholly of <hi rend="italic">invective</hi>, and taking no sympathetic consideration of the <hi rend="italic">Per-Contra</hi> side, is actually (one may say) <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi> to the poor Parsons; and an impartial reader, however heartily he start in the business, and applaud the details as it goes on, gets gradually disaffected; and longs for some <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> place of survey, on higher ground than the Writer ever assumes, or at least ever dwells on. The whole matter grows at last too like a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">railing</hi> accusation,&#x201C;&#x2014;which tone those that <hi rend="italic">best</hi> sympathize in the accusation itself will not be among the last to take offence at.</p>
<p>I could fancy a dextrous swift Editor cutting out pieces of this Article, and introducing here and there a modifying paragraph of more solid matter,&#x2014;which, like additional slices of <hi rend="italic">bacon</hi> introduced into the superabundant <hi rend="italic">mustard</hi> (if you can excuse that figure), might bring out a comfortable result after all! But where is that thrice-dextrous deepseeing &#x201C;Able Editor?&#x201C; And besides, perhaps the trouble would be <hi rend="italic">too</hi> great.</p>
<p>You and F<hi rend="italic">n</hi> ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to fly asunder; not, if you can help it, at least not till you have ascertained that there is no method of going together. By <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> you will not be able to negotiate anything about this Article or about others. In an <hi rend="italic">interview</hi>, continued at discretion, you might get to the bottom of the affair,&#x2014;if it chanced to have any bottom.&#x2014; I have sealed up the <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi> &#x26;c in its cover; and the whole lies here under your address, ready for any messenger you may send for it.</p>
<p>I ought to say in conclusion that all this, of firing light or heavy shot into modern Orthodoxy, Battles of Churches, Creeds of Christendom &#x26;c &#x26;c is, to me as an individual, heartily uninteresting, and even sad and distressing, tho&#x2019; I know it is necessary and has to be. The &#x201C;triangular duel&#x201C; of Holyoakism,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The atheism of George Jacob Holyoake (<date when="1817">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1906">1906</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33964"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>). TC was trying to mediate tolerantly between Chapman&#x2019;s Comtean positivism and outright atheism and Foxton&#x2019;s apparently frantic attacks on religious dishonesty.</note> Pantheism &#x26; Pottheism I consider to be a confused inevitability; but am, for myself, quite over the hills and far away from it, and prefer much more so to abide.&#x2014;<closer><salute>Believe me</salute></closer></p>

<p>My greetings to you, dear and noble Lady. You are in a better climate than I today; and I hope are happier in various ways,&#x2014;which you may easily be, without losing head under the skies. This is the perfection of summer weather, bright sun, clear light airs from the Northern quarter, and all things green and leafy, even Chelsea is green. At the Grange (or in the Bog of Allen)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A series of peat bogs in central Ireland; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18481128-TC-JCS-01"><sic>23:163</sic><corr>TC to JCS, <date when="1848-11-28">28 Nov. 1848</date></corr></ref>.</note> it must be beautiful: but here? I love it not; the coldest of the year suits me better. In fact one generally &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">is</hi> sorrowful all the same&#x201C;; and it is really a great shame, if one thought well of it!</p>
<p>But I have sat these 5 days (today all shutters in action, and no waistcoat on) actually <hi rend="italic">making an index</hi> to the Fritz correspondences &#x26;c; one of the saddest drudgeries an African could be set to in such weather; but actually <hi rend="italic">indispensable</hi>, so have these Berlin friends of mine arranged it. What is ever to become of this <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi>, the gods only know: to me he is and has been a sore Fritz,&#x2014;better almost have shot me at the Battle of Leuthen when his hand was in! O pity me, pity me,&#x2014;but not for that alone!</p>
<p>We were to have gone to Mrs Milnes last night; but couldn&#x2019;t muster resolution. With a dull Book even, one has more sovreignty, a royaller time. I finished <hi rend="italic">Wraxall</hi>, and staid at home, in grim protest ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> many things.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Nathaniel Williams Wraxall, <hi rend="italic">Historical Memoirs of My Own Time, <date when="1772">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1784">1784</date></hi>, (<date when="1815">1815</date>). On <date when="1853-06-26">26 June</date>, TC noted in his Journal: &#x201C;Reading <hi rend="italic">Lord Mahon</hi>, reading <hi rend="italic">Wraxall</hi>, reading&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign> I am wretched, and (in silence) nearly mad!&#x201C;.</note> No word from Clough yet? I suppose within a week there will be. A strange Pamphlet (by our old friend <hi rend="italic">Sleeman;</hi> whom you remember at Alverstoke?) was sent me last night: on Indian children stolen by wolves, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> always eaten, but sometimes recaught.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maj.-gen.

Chambers tells me that your curiosity has been excited by a paper of mine in the Journal about Wolf Children. &#x2026; Col. Sleeman, with whom I have corresponded for many years, is a calm, steady, prosaic person, the last man in the world to allow his imagination to run away with him. He is now an elderly man, but has never left India since he went there in boyhood. &#x2026; [F]or a good many years he has been British Resident at Lucknow, near the locality of the wolf adventures. &#x2026; It would give me great satisfaction to hear that you had determined &#x2026; to inquire into this subject, for it is one of the highest philosophical importance. &#x2026; If these things <supplied>[about the failure of wild children to develop as human beings]</supplied> are true, Man could not have grown under the law of Nature: he must have been a special creation of the Intelligence which established the law of nature.&#x201C; Ritchie&#x2019;s paper not traced.</note> They are then (thinks Sleeman) grown <hi rend="italic">wolfish</hi> <pb id="pg-28-165" n="28:165"/>to the very soul,&#x2014;yet I perceive, tho&#x2019; they bite, run on all fours (very swift), eat raw offal &#x26;c, they are not <hi rend="italic">in</hi>human altogether, only dreadfully misbred! Nothing can be more horrid than the tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> all this gives rise to; yet there is a strange fascination in it; and till I actually <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> Sleeman, the rumour ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> his statements was perfectly bewildering to me.&#x2014; &#x2014; I intend to make you read the Pamphlet (for your sins) some evening.</p>

I will try to secure Mr. Spedding at the same time;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson was sympathetic to Delia Bacon&#x2019;s theories that Shakespeare&#x2019;s works were written by a group led by Francis Bacon (see introduction), and he had written TC, <date when="1853-05-12">12 May</date>: &#x201C;Miss Bacon of New Haven, Connecticut, goes to prosecute certain literary enquiries. &#x2026; She is herself a lady of great worth. &#x2026; Her studies respect English history, &#x26; mainly Shakespeare, &#x26; his time. Have you not a friend&#x2014;Mr Spedding, who writes, or was writing Lord Bacon&#x2019;s Life? If he is near you, &#x26; accessible, can you not obtain for Miss Bacon an interview with him? If to this you will add any instructions to Miss B., that will facilitate her access to the Library of the British Museum, you will effectually serve her.&#x201C; Emerson wrote Delia Bacon the same day: &#x201C;I send a letter &#x2026; for Carlyle, to find Spedding. I think I will write myself again to Carlyle, as I shall need, perhaps, in a few days&#x201C; (T. Bacon, <hi rend="italic">Delia Bacon</hi> 58). Bacon sailed from New York, <date when="1853-05-14">14 May</date>, and arrived in Liverpool, <date when="1853-05-24">24 May</date>.

I wish you could have heard him laugh. Once or twice I thought he would have taken the roof of the house off. At first they were perfectly stunned&#x2014;he and the gentleman he had invited to meet me. They turned black in the face of my presumption. &#x2018;Do you mean to say,&#x2019; so and so, said Mr. Carlyle, with his strong emphasis; and I said that I did; and they both looked at me with staring eyes, speechless for want of words in which to convey their sense of my audacity. At length Mr. Carlyle came down on me with such a volley. I did not mind it the least. I told him he did not know what was in the Plays if he said that, and no one <hi rend="italic">could</hi> know who believed that that booby wrote them. It was then that he began to shriek. You could have heard him a mile. I told him too that I should not think of questioning his authority in such a case if it were not with me a matter of <hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi>. I did not advance it as an opinion. They began to be a little moved with my coolness at length, and before the meeting was over they agreed to hold themselves in a state of readiness to receive what I had to say on the subject. I left my introductory statement with him&#x201C; (T. Bacon, <hi rend="italic">Delia Bacon</hi> 62&#x2013;63).</note></p>

<p>You get <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Notes this morning; of which the other was written yesterday,&#x2014;and put into a wrong post-office, by my unfortunate self! On arriving at the Hospital Clock, I perceived that it was already 5 p.m. &#x26; not 4; and that your poor little Letter wouldn&#x2019;t go: I ran back; but of course there was no remedy; Postmasters dare not be hanged even to oblige a favoured individual!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p><pb id="pg-28-167" n="28:167"/>I cannot well make out what Clough will do: I even looked into the Note for you, hoping there might be farther light there; but there is not.

And his little Damsel, if she want a clever man, must not insist on his being a rich one too: she actually is not right for that.&#x2014; &#x2014; However, I hope it will go wisely after all. I shall otherwise be a good deal vexed, and almost provoked.</p>
<p>The bright sun, and all sun, is gone today; a shower in the night, has clothed everything with hot damp grey.&#x2014; I have finished my Index, however: thank Heaven.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Emerson has sent me from Yankee-Land a female Enthusiast for Shakspeare,&#x2014;who has discovered (in her own <hi rend="italic">head</hi> chiefly, I doubt) an entirely &#x201C;new Biography of Shakspeare, &#x201C; thinks his Plays, so thrice-miraculous are they, were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> written by <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, but by&#x2014;the Lord knows whom:&#x2014;and, in brief, has come to England with the hope of supporting that sublime notion by investigations in the old Country! For the rest, rather a clever Damsel,&#x2014;of mature age, probably 40; of good manners, tho&#x2019; with the most amazing Yankee Drawl; and on the whole, shrewd and veracious, notwithstanding this <pb id="pg-28-168" n="28:168"/>in<supplied>[con]</supplied>ceivable<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> hypothesis of hers. Name, &#x201C;Miss Delia L.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, for &#x201C;S.&#x201C;</note> Bacon&#x201C;; lodges at Chapman&#x2019;s 142. Strand. We saw her here last night; and Spedding, to whom Emerson had especially recommended that I should apply on her behalf, assisted in the solemnity. Spedding and we were struck with astonishment; but for the rest, gave our ready offer (for Miss Delia is really an excellent soul, and almost pretty,&#x2014;if we consider &#x201C;what an odds 40 year makes of a girl!&#x201C;)&#x2014;our offer, I say, to be of any help in our power towards elucidating this sublime mystery</p>
<p>Miss Delia did not seem to want much help; did however admit at last that she sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to &#x201C;see Mr Collyer once.&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Payne Collier.</note> Spedding does not know Mr C., nor do I; but S. thinks and I that you do.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had corresponded with him since at least <date when="1832">1832</date> and still did; see Davies, <hi rend="italic">John Forster</hi> 83.</note> And this is the goal and winning post towards which all this long story has been hitching and halting, not being able to <hi rend="italic">gallop</hi> (tho&#x2019;, or almost <hi rend="italic">because</hi> my hurry is so great)!&#x2014; &#x2014; Collier, it seems, is out of Town too; but perhaps you know, or can form some guess, when he will return? Nay that is not quite necessary. All that is essential will be (if you do know Collier, and can write such a thing), that you write a single line of introduction for this Miss Delia L. Bacon to the learned Editor of Shakespeare <supplied>[(]</supplied>putting his Town-Address, upon it), and send the said Note to me, who will duly forward it to Miss Delia; by <hi rend="italic">whom</hi> again &#x26;c &#x26;c. In short, dear Forster, there is the whole matter:&#x2014;and if you <hi rend="italic">don&#x2019;t</hi> (for any reason) like writing to Col<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on that score, then never mind at all: this Delia-Shakspeare business, I fear, verges terribly upon moonshine throughout;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Delia Bacon wrote Emerson, <date when="1853-11-12">12 Nov. 1853</date>, to explain that she had delayed writing until she had &#x201C;some news to tell you.&#x201C; Everyone she met was inaccessible to reason: &#x201C;Not the least shadow of an argument has been produced against me. Blind pertinacious feeling &#x2026; is all that I have to contend with. The only effect of conversation on the matter seemed to throw them into a state of dumb horror and amazement. Carlyle and Spedding both turned black in the face when they found out what I really had to say to them. Of course for your sake they would treat me respectfully, let me say what I would. And I found Carlyle exceedingly good humored and very kind and very pleasant. They &#x2026; offered me their aid in my researches&#x201C; (MS: Mass. Historical Society). She had left her introductory paper with TC (which Emerson had seen), and TC asked permission to send it to Milnes (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530614-TC-DB-01">TC to DB, <date when="1853-06-14">14 June</date></ref>). She then wrote a longer paper, which she later sent to TC.</note> and in case of extremity, I suppose I may write to C<hi rend="italic">r</hi> myself.&#x2014; In the name of the Prophet, Figs!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We hear you are out at Hampstead; which is a wise movement. May these balmy summer airs go into your very bones, and set you up again firm on the same: that is, as I can certify, a right hearty prayer in this house, dear F.!&#x2014; At <pb id="pg-28-169" n="28:169"/>any rate, you stand to it like a man, and won&#x2019;t be beaten; which is itself almost better than not having to fight! Nevertheless get well again as fast as possible,&#x2014;we can&#x2019;t do without our Forster long! And send us word at any rate how you are, and when we are to see you again.</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I got your cheerful little Note from Scotsbrig, and delivered the fragrant woodrif<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; for woodruff.</note> according to order. Today, in great haste, I send you a word of answer; having, in the meanwhile, begged a Daguerrotype of Jane for you (an expressive but dreadfully unfavourable likeness!&#x2014;as they all are, and this is the best of 3 or 4); which I here enclose. That indeed is the main purport of my writing; and nearly all the <hi rend="italic">news</hi>, or other advantage, I can afford you today.</p>
<p>We have had very hot weather; and I took as usual, no benefit from it, but grew uncommonly <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi>, and therefore uncommonly wretched and useless; however, we have today, an unlimited deluge of constant long-continued rain (began some time in the night, and it is now 3 p.m. and brisk rain still); which will comfortably freshen the world for us, and do immense good to the grasses and trees.</p>
<p>I get no way made hitherto in my work, absolutely none; only persist, in the most sad manner; and must just go on <hi rend="italic">till</hi> I succeed.&#x2014; &#x2014; We have kept quite out of the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">UncleTom</hi>mery&#x201C; here; and have never once seen the Mrs Beecher Stowe,&#x2014;knowing well enough that out of an innocent-minded commonplace Yankee Schoolmistress you cannot for your life make a world&#x2019;s wonder, and pearl of nature,&#x2014;and would be wiser if you did n&#x2019;t try! The nonsense, I think, that has come up this year,&#x2014;table-turning, spirit-rapping &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;even exceeds the average of years. For another instance: One Albert Smith, a very unsuccessful Writer of trashy <hi rend="italic">Laughing</hi> matter <hi rend="italic">without</hi> any laughter in it,&#x2014;in fact, a nearly unmitigated blockhead,&#x2014;went travelling, the other year; and came home with an account of his &#x201C;Ascent of Mont Blanc&#x201C; (the highest of the Swiss Alps), which he delivers for a good while back, daily, with &#x201C;views&#x201C; (I believe) and such <hi rend="italic">blether</hi> of Cockney balderdash interlarded with d<hi rend="italic">o wit</hi> as he can command (resembling &#x201C;wit&#x201C; as sawdust does gunpowder): and, all this year and last, the biggest room will not contain his <pb id="pg-28-170" n="28:170"/>Audiences, which are 3 daily; and about 16,000 human creatures applying for admission in due turn, are on his books just now; and he is making, for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> shot of work, &#xa3;5,000 a-year;&#x2014;as I heard yesterday with laughter and astonishment; and found really to be not quite incredible, but a kind of shadow probably of the real fact!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Albert Richard Smith (<date when="1816">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860">60</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25768"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), journalist; he wrote for <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi>, and novels, plays, and tales.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your continual attention in sending news about my Mother; which is in reality the greatest favour to me. I have been much out of disposition for writing to anybody of late, and indeed generally am; it is all the kinder in you that you continue your precious bulletins, and go on writing without the due return of answers. I am in a dreary way of <hi rend="italic">business</hi> without success in getting anything <hi rend="italic">done;</hi> a very sad predicament indeed for a working man! All the past week and more has gone, for example, in making to myself an <hi rend="small-caps">Index</hi> to the Letters, Writings &#x26;c of my unfortunate Fritz: in the Cartload of Books written hitherto on that subject there is no <hi rend="italic">available</hi> article of that kind; but only various <hi rend="italic">un</hi>available,&#x2014;mournfully testifying the prevalence of Human Pedantry, and in general of Human <hi rend="italic">Stupidity</hi> (which takes many forms) in the treatment of that matter! How I shall next bestir myself is still an uncertainty: I am in the sad case of going round this bleak sandy <pb id="pg-28-171" n="28:171"/>subject, and round it, and on all sides trying in vain to bore for a <hi rend="italic">well</hi> into it. <hi rend="italic">Persistance</hi>, however, is the one law for me hitherto; I must not quit it yet, under penalty of doing worse. The fact is, my heart is dreadfully crushed down; and I have risen in right indignation as of old against the obstacles, and crushed them into subjection. That is the method; and to that it must come at last, or to <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> and to being quite <hi rend="italic">beaten</hi> in the business. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi!</hi></foreign></p>
<p>We had John Gordon here, as perhaps you would see in a Note to my Mother: I think it was about the very time when you were in Edinburgh; so that you would not see poor G. when there. He is of all mortals the least productive in an interview; but one always likes to see his honest face again, for the sake of old times, poor good soul. We had him here only for an hour or so, in company with an Oxford &#x201C;Mr Lingen&#x201C; (a clever Clerk of the Privy-Council Education people, but otherwise worth nothing to me);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ralph Robert Wheeler Lingen (<date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1905">1905</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34548"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), civil servant; B.A., Trinity Coll., Oxford, <date when="1840">1840</date>; fellow of Balliol, <date when="1841">1841</date>; called to bar, <date when="1847">1847</date>; sec. to education office, <date when="1849">1849</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869">69</date>.</note> Mazzini too was here; and Gordon, tho&#x2019; conditionally predicting such a thing, did not come again.&#x2014; Mazzini, home safe from his mad adventure, was quite cheerful, gay and amusing; and did not seem in the least conscious of what a poor figure he had cut in the eyes of all rational onlookers, or how much he had lost in men&#x2019;s esteem here by such a pitiful &#x201C;revolution&#x201C; <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; la Donnybrook</hi></foreign>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Uproar; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421121-TC-JOST-01"><sic>15:198</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1842-11-21">21 Nov. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> He stays constantly in a circle of Ashhursts &#x26;c;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Henry Ashurst (<sic>1792</sic><corr>bap. <date when="1791">1791</date>?</corr>&#x2013;<date when="1855">1855</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/785"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480826-TC-JAC-01"><sic>23:100</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1848-08-26">26 Aug. 1848</date></corr></ref>), solicitor, radical reformer, and champion of women&#x2019;s rights.

<p><salute>My dear good Mother,&#x2014;</salute>It is far longer than I intended it should be since I wrote; and today again I am in a heap of hurries, and sadly tumbled hither and thither! I hoped to have written a more deliberate letter, than I now can; but <hi rend="italic">some</hi> letter I will write before going out: alas, that is all I can do for my good old Mother, and I ought not to neglect that. Thro&#x2019; Jean and others, I suppose, you would hear in general how we were; and not be uneasy in your imagination about us since you last heard.</p>
<p>I get on very ill with my work; in fact, do not get on at all: but I must be perpetually <hi rend="italic">trying;</hi> unless I <hi rend="italic">stand to it</hi>, thro&#x2019; good success and ill, there will evidently nothing come of it. Some day or other one does reap all the fruit of all the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> work one has done; that is one&#x2019;s comfort. The un<hi rend="italic">real</hi> and mistaken work <supplied>[which]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> must all be blown away is chaff; and one will then be thankful for the little handful of true wheat that remains.</p>
<p>Summer is now here in all its force and splendour; really beautiful weather, I hardly remember finer for many years back. Nor is it yet intolerably hot: at the beginning of this week (Monday chiefly) we had a most copious drenching of thorough rain; soft brisk southwest wind blows ever since; and all Nature, living and inanimate, rejoices in the brightness. I hope my good Mother gets the benefit of it; a great change indeed from the dreary harsh element we had not many weeks ago. John, I understand, is to be down with you today or tomorrow: I hope to hear good accounts by him before we are much older.&#x2014; &#x2014; Heat does not ever suit me very well; but in general I am no worse than formerly, better rather: only <hi rend="italic">last night</hi> (that is the truth) I had a baddish sleep; and have been much bothered with &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">daundering</hi></foreign> individuals&#x201C; who (on <hi rend="italic">false</hi> tho&#x2019; plausible pretences!) have got in to me, and interrupted my bits of affairs!&#x2014; Jane, poor thing, did not sleep well either and we have the <hi rend="italic">joiners</hi> and <hi rend="italic">painters</hi> once more in our premises. Happily this <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the &#x201C;last <pb id="pg-28-174" n="28:174"/>time&#x201C;; they are painting &#x26;c my new library-room (which will be very nice there);&#x2014;and it will be a marvellous fact, I think, if I engage in the business of &#x201C;Repairs&#x201C; again for a while! I am banished upstairs today and yesterday,&#x2014;to the &#x201C;new Bedroom&#x201C; (in the third story, in the front of the house), which is a large place, very neat and trim, with window blinds &#x26;c and the carpet <hi rend="italic">off</hi>, where I am very snug, considering, and fully quieter than down below.&#x2014; One of my visitors today was a man<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Ede; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530727-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1853-07-27">27 July</date></ref>.</note> I thought of engaging as a <hi rend="italic">clerk</hi>, to help me in the Museum &#x26;c, in this business: I did not quite engage him; but have a kind of notion that I shall, so soon as I have got it well schemed out.&#x2014; Jane is still clear for Moffat about the end of this month or beginning of next: a few weeks of country Scotland will almost certainly do her good. Of the <hi rend="italic">Glen</hi> affair there is yet no news to be had; but I am somehow led to believe it will be as I said before,&#x2014;some small result got out of it. It seems now, however, the decision is not to be in the &#x201C;end of <date when="1853-06">june</date>, &#x201C; but &#x201C;some time in <date when="1853-07">july</date>&#x201C;; so much belated are the Parliamentary Affairs this year.&#x2014; We are going out to Addiscombe (10 miles off), Jane and I, tomorrow, with the Ashburtons, to stay till Monday: a beautiful place, where one <hi rend="italic">might</hi> get some benefit; but alas&#x2014;! Dear good Mother, I will be a better <foreign>Bairn</foreign>; and write again very soon. <closer><salute>My blessings on you all. Your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>Dear Milnes,&#x2014;</salute>If you do want to see that stupendous product of human ingenuity here so concisely touched upon, it is much at your service, if I could meet you with it, anywhere, or if any servant (in defect of yourself) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> call for it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC means Delia Bacon&#x2019;s paper, mentioned in her letter to TC, <date when="1853-06-15">15 June</date>, on which TC wrote to Milnes. She thanked TC for writing to Collier and explained: &#x201C;My embarrassment arose from the fact that I went to you supposing that Mr Emerson had written to you on the subject, and that you were already prepared in fact for an explanation of my real object in visiting this country. &#x2026; But when I found how entirely unprepared you were for my conclusion, I was too well aware of the profound incredulity and impatience which the first statement of it must elicit, to be willing to pursue the subject in that manner. &#x2026; The paper I left with you represents the earlier stage of my belief, and I can only make use of it to prepare the way a little for that which follows. If you will be so kind as to send it to Mr Milnes, with that explanation, I shall be very glad to avail myself of the opportunity it offers me of opening the subject to him. Mr Emerson half promised me a letter to Mr M but it did not come before I left.&#x201C; Milnes was to call on Bacon but could not help her.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday, being detained at Addiscombe till after Post-time, I sent you forward a <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, which I hope would arrive, and prevent any uneasy imaginations about us. We expected to come home in the <hi rend="italic">morning</hi> of Monday; but, by hospitable pressing &#x26;c, it was not till nine at night that we got away:&#x2014;I had a very pretty ride outside, thro&#x2019; the summer air, Jane <hi rend="italic">inside;</hi> and we found all safe here on our return about 11. One of our days at Addiscombe was wholly wet till towards evening; but even that was not unpleasant in the beautiful green silent country; and all the rest of the time was sunny weather, or fine <hi rend="italic">grey</hi> which I like better. We were a small quiet party, and did very well; a little breath of pure country very agreeable after these months of town. Yesterday we had a drive to a place called <hi rend="italic">Hayes</hi>, some four or five miles away; a House worth looking at, for it was the dwelling place of a great man called Lord Chatham, and the birthplace of Pitt his son! I was the discoverer of this fact; not a soul knew anything about such a thing, or would believe it, till we went and found that the people in the House itself were familiar with it,&#x2014;knew Pitt&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">birthroom</hi>, Chatham&#x2019;s bedroom &#x26;c &#x26;c. The latter, a truly remarkable person, had new-built the place, according to his own plans; a terrible &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">capon</hi></foreign> [hypochondriac]&#x201C; for nervous ill health, horror of noises &#x26;c &#x26;c:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Pitt (<date when="1759">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806">1806</date>), prime minister, son of William Pitt (<date when="1708">1708</date>&#x2013;<date when="1778">78</date>), 1st earl of Chatham, statesman, was born at Hayes Place, nr. Bromley, Kent, the house that his father rebuilt and where he planted extensive gardens. The elder Pitt bought the house, <date when="1754">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1755">55</date>, lived there for about ten years, then sold it. When he fell ill, believing that air at Hayes was beneficial, he rebought it and lived there from <date when="1767">1767</date> till his death.</note> we were all very glad to have seen it, and the thick shady woods that are round it.</p>
<p>Coming home, I found, among other things, a Canada Newspaper from Alick; of which I clip off the date and title for you, and send the <hi rend="italic">cover</hi> with its <pb id="pg-28-177" n="28:177"/><hi rend="italic">three</hi> strokes. <hi rend="italic">Three</hi>, I suppose, mean that a small packet I had sent for Alick,&#x2014;consisting of my own Portrait and Jane&#x2019;s (like what you got),&#x2014;had arrived safe, and that otherwise too all was well. This will serve my poor Mother for a <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> from Canada, or some thing almost as good; and, I need not doubt, will be very welcome.</p>
<p>Jamie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> Newspaper has never yet come; I send you off the <hi rend="italic">Examiner;</hi> I myself read another copy of it at Addiscombe.</p>
<p>Our Painters are here; but we keep the door strictly shut upon them; and they do not do us much ill. Besides we hope they will be away in a few days,&#x2014;and that we shall never see their faces again (or <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> never)!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am in treaty with some &#x201C;dud of a body,&#x201C; who wishes to be &#x201C;clerk&#x201C; to me, to <hi rend="italic">copy</hi> for me, go to the Museum &#x26;c; but I rather fear he will not answer after all; so shall hardly engage him. He <hi rend="italic">lives too far off</hi>, that is the worst fault (nearly 10 miles from me)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ede.</note>; and writes but an indifferent hand.</p>
<p>All about Addiscombe, and in <hi rend="italic">Pitt&#x2019;s</hi> park at Hayes, the people are busy mowing; and have a most sappy and heavy swath of hay;&#x2014;all <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> grass, as usual. The crops generally look extremely well. On the top of the height (near Pitt&#x2019;s place) I remember nothing <supplied>[but]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> rye in ear.</p>
<p>But I must go, my dear good Mother! Ah me, ah me; I had, and have always, so many things in my heart that long to be spoken to you:&#x2014;but you understand the best of them without any speaking. <closer><salute>May blessings be on you, dear Mother, I send my love to all. Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The other night, I saw Lord Stanley; and learned from him that the decision of our affair is not likely to be at &#x201C;the end of <date when="1853-06">june</date>,&#x201C; after all; but will probably be postponed into the latter part of <date when="1853-07">july</date>,&#x2014;the &#x201C;business of the session&#x201C; being belated this year, and the Pension-fund not likely to be voted till about then. So that, once more, we must have patience! There is nothing we can do but patiently wait.</p>
<p>My own anticipations have not altered, at any rate have not <hi rend="italic">worsened</hi>, since I wrote last: I still hope, from all the indications I can gather, that some little thing will be done for Mrs Glen,&#x2014;some little, I dare not hope for <pb id="pg-28-178" n="28:178"/>much;&#x2014;and she and you may depend upon hearing at once, so soon as a decision is arrived at.</p>
<p>I thought it better to write this word in the meanwhile, that there might be no disappointment by such <hi rend="italic">delay</hi> which is otherwise of no consequence to the issue.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got your last Letter duly; and, as you may believe, it has been often in my thoughts since. Alas, alas! The thing that I have feared, all my life ever since consciousness arose in me, is now inevitably not distant. I gather, from your softened expressions, how very weak my poor Mother is; how unlikely you think it that she shall be spared to us much longer. No sterner thought ever fixed itself in my mind;&#x2014;there it dwells ever since your Letter: and why should I <hi rend="italic">attempt</hi> to put it away! The Past is now all that we have; in the Future there <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be rationally no store of hope for us. Ah me, ah me!&#x2014; &#x2014; Really one of my chief comforts at present is the thought that you are near my good and dear old Mother; that nothing which <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be done for her solace and alleviation is or will be omitted by you. I am very weak here, far away, and as good as able to do nothing. I calculate that, if I live much longer, I shall <hi rend="italic">weep</hi> once more in this world, and probably but <hi rend="italic">once</hi>, however long I live! But we must not dwell on that either; we must take the blessed and heavenly element along with us that lies in this sadness too; and, on the whole, &#x201C;trust in God,&#x201C; as our dear Mother herself would say,&#x2014;even so, &#x201C;trust in God&#x201C; for all that lies ahead of us in Time, and in the Eternities that are beyond Time.&#x2014; &#x2014; I will write no more at present in that sad strain.</p>
<p>My work here is in the most untowardly unmanageable condition, and makes no way at all; waits till sufficient strength return to me to grapple it and crush it down into obedience to me,&#x2014;or failing that, till sufficient indignation accumulate to produce a <hi rend="italic">spasm</hi> of the right kind in what &#x201C;strength&#x201C; I have! I was never yet quite beaten; and shall not willingly submit to be so, this time either. In fact, there is great store of <hi rend="italic">dross</hi> in me; that I believe is really the meaning of most of this wretchedness; and that must be burnt out of me (even for my own objects) by such methods as there are. Methods are not wanting! Hardly in my lifetime have I felt lower, lonelier, weaker, or been in <pb id="pg-28-179" n="28:179"/>fact in poorer bodily health, than during the last year. I do begin, at bottom, to feel sometimes a little <hi rend="italic">clearer</hi> and as it were better,&#x2014;simply by dint of <hi rend="italic">waiting in silence</hi>. &#x201C;Some work,&#x201C; I know farther, is my only remedy. I am in hopes, when left <hi rend="italic">entirely alone</hi>, I may make a little better progress in my enterprises. To seek repose by &#x201C;travelling&#x201C;&#x2014;my soul shudders at the thought when I recollect what travelling was last year and indeed has always been to me. The noises &#x26;c are bad here when my nerves get below par; but what are they in other foreign places, where myself and my ways are an extraneous interpolation in those of other mortals! Let the sick man lie in his own bed, at <hi rend="italic">home</hi>, such as his home is!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have dim damp weather, which is very agreeable to me, and has a temperature soft as silk: no fresher grey wind can blow anywhere than this that is now shaking my windows,&#x2014;in the <hi rend="italic">front</hi> upstairs bedroom, which is now really quite a neat and pretty place: I am banished hither, for a week past, by the Painter people, who I hope <hi rend="italic">are</hi> now departing forevermore. I live very much alone, as much as I can contrive: few people&#x2019;s speech does me any good at all; mischief rather, and it is better to avoid that. This morning, however, I went to breakfast with Lord Mahon: he asks me <hi rend="italic">once a year;</hi> and this I think is the third year since I have gone; and <hi rend="italic">once</hi> this year I had refused already, so there was no help! We found Hallam (dullest of mortals), Lord Granville, and some French and Yankee specimens &#x26;c: &#x201C;all very well, all very <hi rend="italic">well!</hi>&#x201C; and my headache is not so bad as it might have been. On Thursday last withal we dined at the Fergus&#x2019;s,&#x2014;Eliz<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Pepoli having just come from Bologna:&#x2014;a trivial little Moncrief Lord-Advocate,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Wellwood Moncreiff (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895">95</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18947"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), liberal M.P. for Leith, <date when="1851">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">59</date>, Edinburgh, <date when="1859">1859</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868">68</date>; lord advocate, <date when="1851">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866">66</date>.</note> and a young Lady who never spoke were the only foreign elements: and such an <hi rend="italic">atmosphere</hi> (four or five oil-lamps burning, and every door and window shut) I do not wish to experience again for some time! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Cui bono</hi></foreign> [for whose good], <foreign><hi rend="italic">cui bono?</hi></foreign></p>
<p>Jane is on the eve of going off to you; will go this week, she says; day not fixed: I guess towards the end of the week; but she is out just now, and has not said precisely,&#x2014;but doubtless will tell you in time. Poor little soul, she too is far from well; but you will take good care of her at Moffat; and the excursion bids fair really to do her good.&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother. Perhaps a Letter will come from you this very night? At all events I shall have a word soon. With love to Sister Phoebe,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear good Mother,&#x2014;</salute>I will write you a little word before I go out this day; alas, it is all I can do for you,&#x2014;the more is my sorrow. But that very small and poor service I ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to leave undone.</p>
<p>This morning we had again a Note from John: he is very punctual about writing; which, as well as his being near you and always within reach, is a great comfort to us. In the Note before last he told us of a <hi rend="italic">ham</hi> you were about sending; good kind Mother! It was very wise and right that he advised you not to send it at present; but the thought of its being intended to be sent is, and will remain, a thing of real value to me. It is one of a thousand such things with which my poor life, ever since it began, has been made rich by you. Whatever other things have gone wrong with me, the love of my true Mother never went wrong, but followed me ever inseparable, in good and evil fortune; and I should be harder of heart than is suitable for man if I could ever forget that fact. And, alas, what can I do in return for you, dear Mother? Nothing, nothing! I will try to <hi rend="italic">live</hi> by the noble example you shewed; and to hold fast for myself, and speak abroad as I can for others, the precious simple <hi rend="italic">wisdom</hi> I learned from my Mother: let that be a comfort to her in her old age, in looking back upon a long life that has had many sorrows in it. And let us all take Courage, Courage; and look, with humble trust for a good issue to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that was really <hi rend="italic">good</hi> in us; and thro&#x2019; Time and thro&#x2019; Eternity, never quit that sacred hope. Oh thank you, thank you, dear pious-hearted Mother, for the precious breeding you gave me: things that I feel to be <hi rend="italic">wise</hi>, to be God&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>, and fit to be spoken aloud before all mortals, and even thundered in their ears in these sad days,&#x2014;how often do I find, with an unspeakable tenderness of recollection, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">That</hi> is <hi rend="italic">thy Mother&#x2019;s</hi>, now; that thou got from thy poor Mother, long ago! May God reward her for it,&#x2014;as of a surety He will and does!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014;I think, the older I grow, the more entirely I feel myself my Father&#x2019;s and my Mother&#x2019;s Son; and have more and more reason to be thankful, and piously proud, that I had such Parents. Courage, dear Mother, we will not fear anything, but hope till death and thro&#x2019; death! The soul that has been devoutly loyal to the Highest, that soul has the eternal privilege to <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>. For <hi rend="small-caps">good</hi> is appointed it, and not evil, as God liveth!&#x2014; &#x2014; I will speak no more on these topics just now: but they are often in my thoughts; and cannot long be absent from any serious heart that would live wisely in a world such as ours.</p>
<p>I see by John&#x2019;s letters that you are very frail and feeble; but I still cannot help thinking this fine summer weather must do you some good: you do get to <pb id="pg-28-181" n="28:181"/>the door he says, but seldom venture farther for some time past;&#x2014;well, well; but he adds also you are clear, quiet and brave, as you have always been. Thank God, for what is even <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than health of body!&#x2014; &#x2014; Here in London the summer is really quite grand; and being full of <hi rend="italic">clouds</hi>, with copious rains, &#x26; loud brisk west winds, no weather could suit <hi rend="italic">me</hi> so well, whatever it may do for the <hi rend="italic">Hay harvest</hi>, which must have suffered sometimes! We have taken off the carpets, totally here up stairs; which I find to be a very great help indeed, when the air is too hot: and I would recommend it much to you if you come to suffer by heat, as is likely enough next month. One can <hi rend="italic">wash</hi> the floor, keep it perfectly clean; sprinkle water on it &#x26;c &#x26;c: in the <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> room (<hi rend="italic">big</hi> room, where I used to sleep), if the carpet were off, I think you might be secure against heat in the warmest afternoon.</p>
<p>My <hi rend="italic">work</hi> makes very little progress here; but I never give it quite up; I, at worst, <hi rend="italic">lean</hi> upon my picks and shovels,&#x2014;up to the loins in inextricable <hi rend="italic">glar</hi>,&#x2014;and consider sorrowfully how I shall <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to get it cleared off!&#x2014; &#x2014; There has not yet any news of the Glen affair come to hand; except only this, that the Pension-fund is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be voted &#x201C;at the end of <date when="1853-06">june</date>&#x201C; (everything being late, this year, in Parliament), but probably &#x201C;in the latter part of <date when="1853-07">july</date>,&#x201C;&#x2014;till which time accordingly (as I wrote to Mr Glen) we must patiently wait. I still expect as before about that matter.</p>
<p>Jane is going off towards you, she decides, on Saturday first, and will be at Liverpool on Saturday night! She will stay at Liverpool a day or two with her uncle; and some day next week, as I calculate, you will see her at Scotsbrig. I think she ought to go to Moffat first; and Jack will bring her down. Poor little Jeannie, she is greatly failed, and I think even failed since last year; but she has a wonderful spirit in her still, and fights along, never yielding.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Isabella, I hope, keeps moderately well: if <hi rend="italic">she</hi> can do &#x26; contrive anything than<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> could be of help to you, I calculate always on her, and she knows that. <closer><salute>My kind regards to Jamie &#x26; her, and to all the kindred near you.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>This morning at ten o&#x2019;clock I put my poor Jane into the Train at Euston Square, on her way towards you; and by this time (3&#xBE; p.m.), if all have gone <pb id="pg-28-182" n="28:182"/>well, she must be approaching the Liverpool region. Her meaning was, to stay in Liverpool not longer than till Tuesday morning (<hi rend="italic">might</hi> be Monday, but not likely);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Fri.</note> and on Tuesday afternoon, some time or other, to be with you in Moffat. Of course she will write, settling the hour &#x26;c; but I despatch this, of my own motion, as harbinger, certain so far, of what will follow.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday I wrote to my Mother,&#x2014;poor old Mother, she is a <hi rend="italic">constant</hi> presence, very sad and very sacred, in my thoughts for some time back.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night was a grand Ashburton Ball,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">ne-plus-ultra</hi> of sublimity: to me, I confess, a mere heaviness and weariness:&#x2014;prime Cost of d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, as I understand, about &#xa3;1000!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am very lonely now (Darwin too is just going off, &#x26;c &#x26;c); I must actually, by way of sole remedy for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things, make a desperate attempt at shoving my heavy baggage of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> a little forward! I am very weakly, biliary, morbidly thin of skin; am best to sit &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">maistly in a place by mysel&#x2019;</hi>,&#x201C; like Ja<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Aitken&#x2019;s crazy joiner.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John or James Thomson; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350128-TC-JCA-01"><sic>8:21</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1835-01-28">28 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> The weather is delightful to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> taste (not to the <hi rend="italic">wheat&#x2019;s</hi>, they say); moist and windy; frequent little S.W. showers, and sky mostly gray.&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; I sent the <hi rend="italic">Nigger</hi> Pamphlet &#x26;c in a Parcel to you the other day: the man paid me &#xa3;20 for 4,000; and they have nothing that I do not well believe. I did not send a Copy to my Mother; meaning <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to judge if it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not afflict <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to read it,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is interesting that TC thought the pamphlet might &#x201C;afflict&#x201C; and &#x201C;offend&#x201C; his mother.</note>&#x2014;and to warn me, and take measures accordingly. Nobody but Jean at Dumfries has got a Copy; <hi rend="italic">item</hi> my own Jane,&#x2014;who, if you think right to warn her, will keep it quite out of my Mother&#x2019;s sight at Scotsbrig. But perhaps it may not be so offensive there now?&#x2014; Enough at present. <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>All right, Dear,&#x2014;</salute>no collisions, no <hi rend="italic">nothink</hi> of a disastrous nature since I started on my travels. Did you hear what my male fellow passenger said, when I appealed to him about Nero? &#x201C;I assure you sir, he will lie quite quiet. Will not give you the slightest trouble.&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I sincerely</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">hope</hi> <hi rend="italic">he will not</hi>&#x201C;! From that specimen you may fancy how courteous <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was likely to be! It was by the strongest protest I succeeded in keeping one fourth of window down&#x2014; <pb id="pg-28-183" n="28:183"/>which there being four of us I maintained was my right. He put them <hi rend="italic">both</hi> up, the Brute, without asking by your leave&#x2014;and would have kept them so all the way. Helen was waiting for me, and the instant the door was opened at Liverpool Nero leapt out, tho&#x2019; he had never stirred at any other stopping&#x2014; The sense of that Dog!!&#x2014;nobody asked for his ticket and I rather grudged the 4/- They were all very glad to see me here&#x2014;especially my dear old Uncle&#x2014; He is much changed inconceivably changed in fact; but&#x2014;for the better!&#x2014;a more <hi rend="italic">beautiful</hi> old man I never set eyes on! He looks eighty in age&#x2014;and so frail that he can hardly get accross the room&#x2014;but his face is spiritualized into perfect beauty! with his blue silk nightcap, sitting there, you would take him for an old Poet or Divine&#x2014;never for a man who had passed his Life in <hi rend="italic">business</hi>&#x2014; I look at him with reverence, and think how few grow old like <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I do not see him for long at a time; he tries to speak to me, and <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi> is extremely difficult for him&#x2014;but he looks so benevolent on me, so content, so away in another world, while yet here; that the tears rise into my throat when I look at him, and think what good must have lain in him always, that he can look thus under his infirmity now.&#x2014; Helen seems pretty well in health, but more skeleton like and more misshapen than ever. Geraldine came over to see me yesterday. and is to stay till to morrow&#x2014; Helen took a bed for her in the street. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> is <hi rend="italic">the same</hi>, outside and in&#x2014;she amuses us all with her manchester stories, and her <hi rend="italic">confessions</hi> of her strange feelings in seeing her new Sister-in-law in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> place&#x2014; The Sister in law behaves &#x201C;very much like a Lady&#x201C; to her as yet;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine&#x2019;s brother Frank, with whom she lived, had recently m. Emily Vandeburgh.</note> but she thinks &#x201C;her own sinful human nature won&#x2019;t let the thing go on long well&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wrote to <hi rend="italic">M</hi>rs John yesterday that I would be with them on Tuesday Helen accompanies me which will make the journey less sad&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have been quit of my <hi rend="italic">sickness</hi> which neither you nor any one knows the constant <hi rend="italic">horror</hi> of, ever since I got into motion&#x2014;and except during last night, I have been free from toothach also. If it continue tonight, I will have the tooth out tomorrow, where the operation can be performed for 5/-</p>
<p>I forgot to say if Griffiths<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the workmen.</note> be about the house, to bid him fasten the top on the little chesstable under the little cupbord&#x2014;and to put a screw in the shutterfastenings of my bedroom window.

<p><salute>Dear little Jeanny,&#x2014;</salute>Take the shortest of words from me by way of welcome to Moffat: it is an hour past the time I calculated, sitting up aloft here,&#x2014;namely &#xBC; past 4 instead of past 3, when Fanny came in with &#x201C;Are ye going out <hi rend="italic">before</hi> dinner, Sir?&#x201C; and made me shove my other papers hastily aside! Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have been very lonely ever since you went; have scarcely spoken to any creature,&#x2014;and am not yet so &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">happy</hi>&#x201C; in my solitude as might have been expected by the common mind.&#x2014; This morning I was sadly disappointed and grieved when Posty went by at nine, and left me nothing. After a while I bethought me that the North Post is irregular, and that eleven o&#x2019;clock was still coming;&#x2014;and accordingly I did then get your good little missive, for which my thanks, and requests for more. The Newspaper came; thanks also for that: I <hi rend="italic">returned</hi> it yesternight, I wonder if you will get it this (Monday) evening? Tomorrow morning at farthest?&#x2014; &#x2014; I aim this at Moffat, as the only sure place since you went. I hope your ugly sickness (of which I do know something) won&#x2019;t come back, which will be a great blessing, and that you will <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> your poor tooth, if only to bite me with it.</p>
<p>The wretched Morganites<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The builder&#x2019;s men.</note> are still here; fiddle-diddling,&#x2014;chiefly in the <hi rend="italic">Hydrastisy</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hydrastisy means &#x201C;water standing place&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520915-TC-JWC-01"><sic><sic>17:284</sic><corr>27:284</corr></sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1852-09-15">15 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>) and suggests either a place where there was a shower or perhaps the outside lavatory.</note> at present: they have spent all day in laboriously <hi rend="italic">scraping off</hi> the vile paint they put there last year, it being a <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> kind as appears. And into that sacred apartment there will be no ingress till about Thursday next! So goes the world. Oh what you must have suffered last year! But let us be patient; it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> end at last.</p>
<p>Yesterday I fear I have behaved really unpolitely to the Lady at Bath House: she asked me one day (before the Ball) or half-asked me in a vague way to come out to Addiscombe for the Twisletons<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Twisletons had been on a European tour. Ellen Twisleton had reported, <date when="1853-06-15">15 June</date>, seeing Elizabeth Browning, &#x201C;except for Mrs Carlyle, altogether the most interesting lady I have ever seen&#x201C; (MS: Houghton Lib., Harvard). TC noted in his Journal, <date when="1853-08-17">17 Aug.</date>, that &#x201C;Twisleton and his brisk bright little American Wife came to us last night: good; some vestiges of human conversations (not too many) once more. An honest man Tw<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and well affected to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, for one merit;&#x2014;loyal to all truth where he can see it. The only official man who has withal a human sense and heart in him and can be made <hi rend="italic">angry</hi> at evil.&#x201C;</note> &#x26; Brookfield, on Sunday; to which I answered vaguely; and there was nothing more said, and no <pb id="pg-28-185" n="28:185"/>apology or refusal ever given;&#x2014;and yesterday, when the time came, I staid in-doors all day, in tolerable weather; and spoke to no mortal, but worked once more (a day of dusty misery for most part) getting up my Books from their place on the floor. The 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> time, if I remember rightly.&#x2014; I read too occasionally; and did not <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> to stay in all day. At 9 p.m., having sent out Fanny, I went out myself,&#x2014;and fled to Chorley for a word of human speech. <foreign>Ach Gott</foreign>! He is very friendly to me, good soul. Hardly anybody else looks with frank kindness upon me at present; and I am terribly thin-skinned, solitary and sad, of late. With Chorley too I am not happy, ach nein! but tomorrow nevertheless I am to go and dine with him.</p>
<p>Griffiths shall glue y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> table tomorrow. There is to be leather on the old Bookshelves (cost 3&#xa3; and odd) dark green, with a gilt <hi rend="italic">stripe</hi>, and star on each lappet. Fanny does very well; and if I were not so dreadfully squeamish and biliary (in body &#x26; soul) I need not be so melancholy as I am.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Best regards to John &#x26; Wife some word of my poor Mother! <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, <foreign>adieu</foreign>.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear little Jeannie,&#x2014;</salute>I have got no Letter from you this morning, not even at 11 did any come: but perhaps there will be one at six, for Jack yesterday taught me confidently to expect one. Meanwhile it is hard on 3; and for a man tenth part so wearied, and worn-out with the ills of life, as I now feel, it is high time to be in the open air, at such a temperature! Pray Heaven, thy own poor toothache be not still bad:&#x2014;or the cocks, or the thousand miseries that beset a skinless creature in this world!&#x2014; &#x2014; But I must hold in all that; and give a hasty word of narrative, the less commentary the better. I have been awakened (by Cocks, Ronca&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dominic Ronca.</note> I think, or else a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> mysterious set) these two successive mornings at 5 o&#x2019;clock; under my windows is a vile yellow Italian grinding;&#x2014;and I am in such a mood for impartial &#x201C;commentary&#x201C; as you may fancy. Oh my little woman, I wish to God thou wert here, to be of some comfort to me,&#x2014;to pity me at least as in thy heart thou wouldst! But let us get on.</p>
<p>Chorley&#x2019;s dinner was of elegant simplicity and wholesome as the repast of sages: ourselves two, a volunteer from Liverpool having been rejected; really a very tolerable evening, with plenty of talk not wholly uninstructive; and shortly after ten, under the serene summer skies, my magnanimous Chorley set me down here (or left me, for we both <hi rend="italic">walked</hi>, of course!) safe at my own <pb id="pg-28-186" n="28:186"/>door. Nevertheless, after reading till my usual hour, I awoke&#x2014;at 4 in the morning; and had such a <hi rend="italic">day</hi> following: ah me, a more miserable day than even this. Silence, silence! I tried too to do a little work; against <hi rend="italic">all</hi> evils one has no redress whatever but the fraction of work one can snatch out of them as by the hair of the head. But I could do no work. Summer with its noises and its heats is very terrible to me in these parts. The Painters too were winding up (Hydrastisy not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> done, nor any of them here these last two days): I <hi rend="italic">worked</hi> three days at my Books again, true Nigger&#x2019;s work; beginning <hi rend="italic">with the sun</hi>, that one day, and not <hi rend="italic">ending</hi> with him, any of the three days. Perhaps I did myself mischief: it is my <hi rend="italic">stomach</hi> and its error that <hi rend="italic">creates</hi> this want of sleep; and I am going to vanquish it on that side if I can.&#x2014; At all events, the room <hi rend="italic">is</hi> now finished, Books once more in apple pie order, and I am now sitting beside them again, without carpet, but really in a clean airy nice place: for it does look all very well; and we shall get some good of it yet, my poor little Jeannie and I,&#x2014;yes, if we can keep the Devil out of us, if it pleased God! Oh Jeannie, Jeannie, you know nothing about me just now: with all the clearness of vision you have, your lynx eyes do not reach into the inner region of me at all, and know not <hi rend="italic">what</hi> is in my heart, what (on the whole) was always, and will always be there: I wish you did, I wish you did! And you shall yet again, if I can compass it.</p>
<p>On the Wednesday night a servant from Bath House had given the bald message That tomorrow (Thursday) was to be the Chobham-Camp<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A military camp nr. Windsor Great Park, about 20 mi. W of London.</note> day; &#x201C;tickets all taken&#x201C;; and <hi rend="italic">if</hi> you go, &#x201C;be at Bath House at half past seven.&#x201C; That will be an early hour!&#x2014; &#x2014; However, on the morrow morning, being awake at five, and meditating on the day I was like to have as sedentary character, I got up, made ready,&#x2014;luckily had swallowed one cup of tea and bit of bread of Fanny&#x2019;s readying or I should have got no breakfast at Bath House (where Lady A. sat also sleepless, and not in her happy mood): and so at half past seven, <foreign><hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi></foreign> [more or less], we rolled away. Lord A. Lord de Mauley (excellent gentle polite man),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Francis Spencer Ponsonby (<date when="1787">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855">1855</date>), 1st Baron de Mauley.</note> these were the rest of the 4. The day proved grey, not quite windless, &#x26; on the whole very beautiful. A riding soldier (<foreign><hi rend="italic">chasseur</hi></foreign>, the French call him) waited to escort us; and the &#x201C;own horses,&#x201C; with a very rough rumbling carriage: the drive, I think, is less than an hour; all manner of omnibuses, gentlemen&#x2019;s carriages, ass-carts, and miscellaneous locomotives, were going the same road,&#x2014;amid clouds of dust; which by superior <hi rend="italic">speed</hi>, we at last got to the front of, and fairly out of. Between 9 and 10, I think; a hot morning, tho&#x2019; with feeble sun: no tobacco permitted hitherto!&#x2014; &#x2014; After considerable hithering and thithering, not of a pleasant kind, we at last fixed upon the right stand-point; unyoked the horses; &#x26; I, <pb id="pg-28-187" n="28:187"/>withdrawing to leaward, could at least smoke and look about me over the camp. It is a grey barren heathy upland, perhaps a mile each way; woods bound it (the Windsor woods towards the north), and a gentle ring of what they call &#x201C;Hills&#x201C; on the sunny side is visible here &#x26; there in the distance. The ground itself is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> broken into heights and hollows; heights that could also be called &#x201C;hills&#x201C;; it was on the crown of one of these, near the extremity of the <hi rend="italic">tents</hi> that we, and many others had taken our stand.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1853-07-09">9 July</date>, reported on events two days before and &#x201C;the brilliant manoeuvres&#x201C; in the presence of the Queen. &#x201C;They consisted chiefly of pontoon work at Virginia Water, and in the opinion of all the military authorities were admirably executed.&#x201C;</note> I thought of poor old Sterling and that fierce Woolwich day<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly maneuvers at the Woolwich Royal Military Academy. Edward Sterling (<date when="1773">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847">1847</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26406"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), the Carlyles&#x2019; old friend; John and Anthony&#x2019;s father.</note>&#x2014;ah me!

But first of the Hy&#xe6;na. on my arrival I found an immense caravan of Wild Beasts pitched exactly in front of this House and they went on their way during the night and the animal in question made a devil of a row&#x2014;I thought it was the Lion roaring but John said &#x201C;no&#x2014;it was <hi rend="small-caps">only</hi> the Hyeana&#x201C;!

The old Vestry-Clerk is an interesting old gentleman, with his &#x201C;tree planted 70 years ago&#x201C;; but he is unquestionably in error as to that Cromwell point of Parish Antiquities. Cromwell did die in <date when="1658">1658</date>; but it is a thing of conspicuous notoriety that his Corpse was torn out of its resting-place in Westminster Abbey in <date when="1660">1660</date>, and did not get finally <hi rend="italic">buried</hi> till that date,&#x2014;and then, naturally, as the Law directed, under the gallows of Tyburn (close by the modern Cumberland Gate of Hyde Park); where it still lies, and will lie,&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">such</hi> company as the Genius of England, much encumbered at that time could succeed in providing for it, and judging the suitablest!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420812-JWC-TC-01"><sic>15:11</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1842-08-12">12 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> A deserved maim upon the Genius of England; which it must forever bear henceforth.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I had evidently read with shameful negligence;&#x2014;indeed I did not know that the <hi rend="italic">place where</hi> had much to do with the question in hand, and so took less note of that point.</p>
<p>But it is as clear as noonday from the very page you were examining that Pharsalia is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the scene of the Centurion&#x2019;s exploit: it is expressly said, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Es</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-28-191" n="28:191"/><foreign><hi rend="italic">wird mehr</hi></foreign> [There will be more]. They talked <hi rend="italic">farther</hi> (going into <hi rend="italic">general</hi> history and talk) of the Tenth Legion; leaving Pharsalia &#x26;c altogether behind them.</p>
<p>So that if you can now find <hi rend="italic">anywhere</hi> a Centurion of the Tenth Legion, called either Q. Caecilius or Q. Icilius, who does a feat in defending a <hi rend="italic">Post</hi> of any kind, either an outpost or his ground in a general battle,&#x2014;we shall have found (in all human likelihood) the very passage in question; and the then fashionable French Translation of that will be the &#x201C;Book,&#x201C; which Icilius the Second produced at Landshut, and convinced the King by.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC never found the source: &#x201C;(what &#x2018;Book&#x2019; nobody would ever yet tell me)&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 18:27).</note></p>
<p>Of course I shall be glad if you decide to <hi rend="italic">catch</hi> this fox (as probably so fierce a leaper and rider will); and tho&#x2019; one cannot make any broth of such a thing, it will be comfortable to see it well slain;&#x2014;and you, as is your right, shall have the brush.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Donaldson replied from the Athenaeum, <date when="1853-07-12">12 July</date>: &#x201C;I have looked well into the question of <hi rend="italic">Quintus Icilius</hi>, &#x26; send you the results. &#x2026; / (1) There was no such person &#x2026; in the army of Julius Caesar. &#x2026; / (2) It appears from Nicolai that either Frederic or Guichard made a mistake respecting the name. May not the sobriquet have been designed to stereotype the blunder? / (3) There either was or was not a reference to the battle of Pharsalia &#x26; the <foreign>&#x2018;schiefe Stellung&#x2019;</foreign> of Caesar&#x2019;s army there. The only centurion who performed an exploit at that battle was <hi rend="italic">Caius Crastonius</hi>, who is mentioned in all the accounts. The <foreign><hi rend="italic">schiefe Stellung</hi></foreign>, which contributed to the victory, is expressly ascribed to Caesar himself. &#x2026; / (4) &#x2018;Quintus Cecilius&#x2019; was a very common name. &#x2026; In any case <hi rend="italic">Quintus Icilius</hi> was a blunder.&#x201C;</note></p>

<p>I do not think there is a stray copy here of any of my Books; and I have no means of getting one which are not common to everybody, namely buying it out of the shop. So that I cannot, in this way, assist in your charitable enterprise; for which defect I am very sorry.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> interested me very much, and I guess it to be well translated, in which case it is a piece of good work done. I learned to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> from it, if not much else of credible, yet in a very interesting and much clearer manner the face of the divine Plato himself, which is eminently Greekish, high and peculiar,&#x2014;worthy to be seen and to be held in mind.</p>

<p>I had a very miserable tour in Germany; not one night of sleep all the time, and nothing, or too little, of the living kind that was beautiful to look upon in return for all that physical distress at once so tormenting and so degrading. I remember the Rhine river as a noble acquisition to my internal picture gallery. Cologne, &#x26;c., I got no good of, but rather mischief; the sight of those impious charlatans doing their so-called &#x201C;worship&#x201C; there (a true devil worship, if ever there was one); and the fatal brood, architectural and others&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Puseyites</hi> and enchanted human apes that inhabit such places&#x2014;far transcended any little pleasure I could have got from the supreme of earthly masonry, and converted my feeling into a sad and angry one.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An outburst of anti-Roman Catholicism. Cologne was overwhelmingly Roman Catholic; Protestants had been expelled in <date when="1618">1618</date>. The immense cathedral, with elaborate artistic treasures, begun in <date when="1248">1248</date>, was undergoing further building and restoration, marked by the opening of the nave, aisles, and transepts in <date when="1848">1848</date>. Next to it was the Jesuits&#x2019; church of St. Ursula. &#x201C;Bunsen had once tried to enlist Carlyle&#x2019;s sympathies in the completion of Cologne cathedral, showing him the plans, &#x26;c. Carlyle said nothing till obliged to speak. Then at last, being forced, he said: &#x2018;It is a very fine pagoda if ye could get any sort of a God to put in it!&#x2019; Bunsen&#x2019;s eyes flashed anger for a moment, but the &#x2018;ridiculous&#x2019; was too strong for him, and he burst out laughing&#x201C; (Froude&#x2019;s note, 4:131&#x2013;32).</note> I was in the Wartburg, however&#x2014;in Martin Luther&#x2019;s room&#x2014;and I believe I almost wept there, feeling it to be, as far as I could understand, the most sacred spot in all the earth at this moment. Here, tempted by the devil (always by &#x201C;devils&#x201C; enough), but not subdued or subduable, stood God&#x2019;s Truth, embodied in the usual way: one man against all men.

Martin himself has a fine German face: eyes so frank and serious, a look as if he could take a cup of ale as well as wrestle down the devil in a handsome manner.</p>
<p>The Wartburg is much visited by tourists; but I was not sorry to find they did not much heed Luther&#x2014;merely took him among the rest and dwelt chiefly on the &#x201C;Byzantine architecture&#x201C; and restorations. The only other beautiful thing I saw was Tieck, and he is since dead. On Fritz I can make no impression whatever, and practically consider I have given him up and am not equal to such a task on such terms.</p>
<p>My wife is now at Moffat with my brother and his household. As to me, I got so smashed to pieces and perceptibly hurt in every way by my journeying last autumn&#x2014;all travel and noise is at all times so noxious to me&#x2014;I have never yet been able to brook the notion of travelling since, but have flattered myself I should sit still here, and would on almost any terms. Certain it is, I have need enough to stay here, if staying by myself in my own sad company be the way to <hi rend="italic">riddle</hi> any of the infinite dross out of me and get a little nearer what grains of metal there may be.</p>

<p>Tho&#x2019; there is no chance of your getting this till Monday morning (thanks to the beggarly Agnewites<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Followers of Sir Andrew Agnew (<date when="1793">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">1849</date>), leader of the Sunday observance movement.</note> of those Pharisiacal regions), and tho&#x2019; it is now striking three again, I cannot forbear sending you, by the earliest moment, a word of counterpoise to that shocking despatch of yesterday,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">less</hi> power to <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, I now wish it had never gone! Poor little Jeannie: but what could I do? Fly for shelter to my Mammy, like a poor infant with its finger cut,&#x2014;complain, in my distress, to the one heart that used to be open to me!</p>
<p>Well, I did get some good sleep last night, two good sleeps,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; at first I failed, and had to come and smoke again about 1 a.m., the Cremorne <hi rend="italic">cannon</hi> (for I think it could not be rockets alone) having woke me &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">before</hi> I got to <pb id="pg-28-194" n="28:194"/>sleep.&#x201C; But the Roncas had faithfully locked up their big Cock again; nay more, a beautiful deluge of rain was falling, which puts to silence such a quantity of vermin:&#x2014;and the truth is, I am well today, and feel myself a new man, and the whole world new in some measure! This I could not but let the soul of a compassionate Goody know.&#x2014;</p>
<p>My Dear, my Dear, what is that you have been about! I trembled in reading your Grey-Mare&#x2019;s Tail adventure: what on Earth could set you on such mad pranks? I cannot understand, from memory, the scene of your peril: I remember a Shepherd had been killed shortly before, climbing by the <hi rend="italic">side</hi> or <hi rend="italic">face</hi> of the Fall itself; but that is pretty nearly perpendicular; of course you could not be there, but must have been on the South side of the stream, I think? Thank God, you are out of it, wherever it was;&#x2014;and take care you never again get into the like, in my time at least! I thank John too a hundred times, for his valiant goodness to you. And Nero, poor wretch of a Nero;&#x2014;he came into my head last night, as I was struggling into sleep; the white barking glance of him, across the hollow-night of my imagination; and how he too would soon vanish, and his love of <hi rend="italic">bones</hi> and of us be alike abolished in the black immensities: I started broad awake, and was heartily <hi rend="italic">wae</hi> for even the poor dog, not to speak of human souls, dear to me, and strangers to me, all subject to the like great Doom. For it is great, tho&#x2019; it is stern;&#x2014;and the imagination can spread out all its wings, and take full sweep, in such an element; and there is Hope too, Hope forever; and broken bits of rainbow hang aloft over the immeasureable deluge and its mountain waves! Oh God the Maker; great God, is He not also <hi rend="italic">Good:</hi> is not that the Name of him to all the true and brave?&#x2014; &#x2014; No more of this just now.</p>
<p>I ought to have finished out my Chobham phenomena, and not stopt at the mere eating of lobsters by voracious Cockneys before the manoeuvres had begun! Well, the essence of the manoeuvres was only this: a sham fight; the one &#x201C;Army&#x201C; represented merely by a row of fellows, scattered at sparse intervals, in white jackets, and lazily firing as they advanced or retreated according to order; the other contained all the 10,000, foot, horse and artillery, and did the thing more to the life; really a fine kind of thing, and not quite worthless as a sight. First you saw all the various bodies of soldiers, marching, with music sounding, far and near along the hill sides, to take up their various positions,&#x2014;Highland kilts, blue trowsers, white trousers; light horse &#x26; heavy: a fine rhythmic thing upon the waste hills and heather, with the white tents if you turned round and looked the other way. Positions once taken, some out of sight in hollows, some conspicuous on hills, there began a series of cavalry charges, artillery vollies, which were <hi rend="italic">unsuccessful</hi>, and had to retreat; till they got behind a great column of infantry, again supported by artillery, the whole firing like mad, and very grand as they stood drawn out on the height and the sky behind them; these also were unsuccessful, and had to <pb id="pg-28-195" n="28:195"/>break into short masses, and file off; these and still others; but, at last, gradually the whole had formed itself again on the last height of all; and, just when white-jackets fancied it all right, stormed down upon said white jackets, and in about a quarter of an hour beat them magnificently home again, with <hi rend="italic">great</hi> expenditure of powder. That, Dearest, was actually the manoeuvre and I thought you would like to know it,&#x2014;being perhaps curious to know how they <foreign><hi rend="italic">ack</hi></foreign> in the various parts.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321010-JWC-EA-01"><sic>6:234</sic><corr>JWC to EA, <date when="1832-10-10">10 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> The camp and the tents, and Lord Hardinge&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lt.-Gen.

<salute>My dear good Mother,</salute>
<p>I was twice disappointed last week in my purposes of writing to you; two days, one after the other, I proved to be so chased with paltry little hurries that I could not get my poor Mother spoken to as I meant: but today I have shoved my papers aside in time, and will not miss.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-197" n="28:197"/>John&#x2019;s report of you is rather more comfortable than before; it was of that day when Dr Hunter and he were with you: he says you were very frail, but clear and cheerful to a beautiful degree. That is well! Let us bear the burden piously that is laid upon us, each with his best virtue and ability, and all shall be well!&#x2014;</p>
<p>No doubt you have heard that Jane has got to Moffat; that Helen &#x26; she flew past you the day I had predicted it, and suffered nothing by their journey. Jane has since been at the <hi rend="italic">Grey Mare&#x2019;s Tail</hi>, she informs me;&#x2014;and ran a bad and useless risk, it appears, in climbing some steep place there; for which she deserves rebuking as an <foreign><hi rend="italic">ill bairn!</hi></foreign> She said, no day was settled for coming down to Scotsbrig; but I hope they will settle it soon, and send me news. John was consummately kind to her, she says, and all was going on very well.</p>
<p>I have got into my old room again, Painters about all <hi rend="italic">off</hi> (let us hope, not to return soon): with carpet off, and with doors and windows open to the due pitch, I easily shift against the heat hitherto; which indeed has never yet been excessive; always rain from time to time, sometimes a night of beautiful <hi rend="italic">lofty</hi> thunders; and few days without some fresh air of wind stirring. One of my worst evils in summer time, in certain states of nerves at least, is the great increse of <hi rend="italic">noise:</hi> I have to keep doors and windows more or less open for air; and all men and animals take to giving voice in the bright weather. It is astonishing how many cocks, parrots, singing thrushes, dogs, dust-carts, dandy-carriages, do announce themselves thro&#x2019; these open windows even in the quietest localities! However, I generally get perfect stillness in the night-time; and have really a <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> chance of sleep in my new room; being at once <hi rend="italic">dark</hi> and silent, yet with the freest air, and both door and window admitting it. Surely many times I am thankful for my quiet bed, when the broken <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> of the unsatisfactory day is done!&#x2014; I sometimes think, however, I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> yet on the tiptop of the House, that impenetrably &#x201C;silent room,&#x201C; double walls, no windows but in the <hi rend="italic">top</hi>,&#x2014;entirely <hi rend="italic">impenetrable</hi> to sound, except out of the skies;&#x2014;and shift up thither with my Books and Papers in my old days. I cannot get into the country regions; I cannot, gladly as I would in many points of view: but in such a room, hanging only to the sky, one might do without country, and get one&#x2019;s poor work <hi rend="italic">a little</hi> better attended to!&#x2014; &#x2014; Alas, alas, my work gets still most miserably ill on: and truly I have chiefly myself and my feebleness, and feckless irresolutions and darknesses, to blame for it; which often produces remorse enough, if that would help in any measure! The <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> is, there is <hi rend="italic">dross</hi> in very great quantities in the subject I have got; and dross in very great quantities in one&#x2019;s own poor self; and <hi rend="italic">both</hi> these drosses have to be <hi rend="italic">burned away</hi>, before the true result can be arrived at; and the process of such &#x201C;burning&#x201C; is not a very pleasant one. We cannot help it; we perhaps should not speak of it.</p>
<p>I sent you a <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> in which there was but one Article I <pb id="pg-28-198" n="28:198"/>wanted you to read: the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> in the lot; it is upon <hi rend="italic">Knox</hi> by a man named <hi rend="italic">Froude</hi> (an impartial English witness), and seems to me well written.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >[J. A. Froude], &#x201C;John Knox,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> N.S. 4 (<date when="1853-07">July 1853</date>):1&#x2013;50, celebrates Knox and says that TC has placed him &#x201C;by the side of Luther as the Hero Priest&#x201C; (2). It is a review of Bohn&#x2019;s cheap edition of Thomas M&#x2019;Crie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of John Knox</hi> (1st edn., <date when="1812">1812</date>; <date when="1847">1847</date>), judged as &#x201C;thoroughly good&#x201C; but too exclusively theological (3).</note>&#x2014; Jamie&#x2019;s Newspaper today again is not come: last monday <hi rend="italic">all</hi> your Newspapers were belated. I was within an inch of missing the Letters too, which have half an hour of farther time granted them. I have not had a Note from Dumfries for some time; but I think Jean is often writing Scotsbrig way. So will I too again before long. <closer><salute>God bless you ever, dear Mother</salute></closer></p>

<p>Well, there is at least one place where my poor good Jeannie will not be superfluous: her own home here, which is always in want of her till she return! That is one comfortable fact; never to be lost sight of.</p>
<p>But I rather surmise you will have no end of invitations, were it once known you are open to such,&#x2014;which I do not want it to be. There are the Erskines, good and kind people tho&#x2019; given to <hi rend="italic">hoohooing</hi>, and terribly afraid of <hi rend="italic">air</hi> in the summer nights: what would you say if they spoke up. Then 30 miles farther is Blanche Airly; and behind is Fife and its kingdoms.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Airlies at Cortachy Castle, the Ferguses and Walter Welsh in Fife.</note> No, you will not be <hi rend="italic">driven</hi> home, I fear; you will leave me here, an unprotected male, for dreary weeks yet.&#x2014; &#x2014; But better than all these, far better according to my computation is Scotsbrig itself whither I rejoice to hear that you are bound. Stay in Scotsbrig till <hi rend="italic">you</hi> want to go. I assure you there is no such &#x201C;lodging house&#x201C; on the seashore or off it for my poor Dame, who is right well liked there. And there need not be the least scruple (as I <hi rend="italic">know</hi>); you can just, at departing, slip into Isabella&#x2019;s hand half as many or &#x2158; as many <hi rend="italic">sovereigns</hi> as you have staid <hi rend="italic">weeks</hi>, and she will reckon herself even commercially a gainer by the job. That is a certain fact: so long as you can stand Scotsbrig then, and Nero has not eaten all the <foreign><hi rend="italic">tewheets</hi></foreign>. My poor Dear shall have a lodging, I think.</p>
<p>For the <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>, know farther always, your room here, both your rooms, are perfectly free of paint, quite pretty indeed; and the weather is really fresh &#x26; nice; <pb id="pg-28-199" n="28:199"/>and the unprotected me&#x2014;he for one is always agog to see you back again!&#x2014; I will write to <hi rend="italic">Scotsbrig</hi> a bit of a Note to you on Thursday when you arrive. <name>T.C.</name></p>

<salute>Dear Isabella,</salute>
<p>Jane, it appears, is going down to you on Thursday to stop for a few days; which I am heartily glad to hear,&#x2014;and hope the &#x201C;few days&#x201C; may <hi rend="italic">lengthen</hi> themselves rather than shorten! She is always well at Scotsbrig; and you are always good to her and to me, and indeed it must be owned, one of the best of landladies generally!&#x2014; Pray keep her as long as seems at all convenient for all parties. Probably she will insist on going &#x201C;on Monday;&#x201C; and, in that case, there is nothing to be said. I know not what her plans are: but I think certainly she will not be <hi rend="italic">better</hi> anywhere till she come home again, than drinking new milk, and quietly strolling over the fields with her little dog hunting <foreign><hi rend="italic">tewheets</hi></foreign> in the peaceable Scotsbrig precincts; and, I for my own part, like better to fancy her there beside my Mother and you than anywhere else. This, however, is purely my own notion; and I can give it only as such; leaving the execution of it to the parties practically interested.</p>
<p>Will you the day <hi rend="italic">after</hi> you get this (that is, <hi rend="italic">on Thursday</hi>, before Jane comes) be punctual in sending down to Middlebie for a Letter or parcel by post, which I am going to send to her there. I suppose you almost always do call at the Post&#x2019;s place; but I particularly wish you not to omit that day, and to have the parcel ready when our poor Pilgrim comes.</p>
<p>I wrote yesterday to my Mother; and shall hear copiously so long as Jane is near you.&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>Good be with you all, dear Isabella: I send my kind regards to Jamie; who is much oftener in my thoughts than he gets mention in my Letters.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Yours affectionately always</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<p>Well, my poor little Pilgrim, I hope you have got (shortly after this Letter) safe to Scotsbrig,&#x2014;on your birthday, as it chances;&#x2014;and I will with my whole <pb id="pg-28-200" n="28:200"/>heart bid you welcome there. I am really grieved at your little disappointment in your Moffat calculations; and, tho&#x2019; it is like water to my own mill (being an unprotected here), I will not take advantage of it! If you could stay <hi rend="italic">there</hi> deliberately till your appetite for rustication were somewhat nearly satisfied, surely I should like it better than any lodging for you; and it strikes me perhaps you may or might? At any rate I suppose they will heartily try (for you are well liked there, and a good deal of natural human politeness exists there, in a form that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can recognise too; and there is perfect cleanliness &#x26;c, only not perfect <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>, at least not without study and contrivance): so I will leave my good dear little Jeanny in that kind element; and she and it will <hi rend="italic">see</hi> what they can make out between them. You will live in the other end from my poor Mother; and will not be together more than is good for both parties. But I charge you, if you can in anything, act for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> there: <foreign><hi rend="italic">ay de mi, ay de mi</hi></foreign> what could &#x201C;I&#x201C; do if even I were there!&#x2014; At all events, send me further correct accounts; I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> in your records as I can do in no other. And surely you will not let me want for Letters now in such an idle region for you? And Nero will go upon the <foreign>tewheets</foreign>; and you can tell him, I am to <hi rend="italic">run half</hi> in all he catches!&#x2014;</p>
<p>No, I did not forget your Birthday, Dearest; but I have been very unfortunate,&#x2014;as with the best intentions I too often am! The fact is, I had purchased a ridiculous Print which had often struck me in Burlington Arcade; with this I meant to make you a <hi rend="italic">mock heroic</hi> gift which would have done: but lo, yesternight when I set to practically <hi rend="italic">packing</hi> it for travel by post, I found difficulties (the wretched shopkeeper having misunderstood me in <hi rend="italic">framing</hi> of the thing)&#x2014;I found impossibilities, and after working from dinner till light failed me over it, I had fairly to give it up (about nine o&#x2019;clock), in a most <foreign><hi rend="italic">vaixed</hi></foreign> humour, and go down to tea. After tea, I replaced it in its frame, put your Nigger Question beside it; tied it up, dated, with paper and string, laid it in your toilet drawer; and there it shall lie unfingered till you are driven home to me again. It might have given you &#x26; the rest of them a bit of laughing at Scotsbrig; but it fairly could not come. And so I have nothing to send you, nothing at all, but that poor <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>, which is of the nature of an <hi rend="italic">empty</hi> emblem, and was meant merely to bring up the rear of the poor Print.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Samuel Johnson</hi>. Helen Allingham describes the print as a &#x201C;coloured lithograph of a wife shaving her husband (she, interrupted by a caller, stands with a razor in right hand and husband&#x2019;s nose in left, leisurely conversing with her visitor). The picture, framed with glass in back and front, is endorsed, &#x2018;To my dear Jeannie (<date when="1853-07-14">14th July, 1853</date>) from her ever affectionate T. Carlyle (Dealer in <hi rend="italic">Emblems</hi>),&#x2019;&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s House</hi> 105.</note>&#x2014; God bless you Dearest, on this and on all days; and may the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of our years and days be over!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Twistleton called by bargain, went to walk with me the day I bo<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that scrubby Print. Really a sensible dialogue we had, such as I get seldom; an <pb id="pg-28-201" n="28:201"/>honest and a friendly kind of soul. Clough is <hi rend="italic">come</hi> but cannot yet decide!

<p>I am afraid almost to tell you that I am <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> without be<supplied>[ing]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> able to say positively that I am coming to see you. When I left London to see <hi rend="italic">you</hi> was one of the chief pleasures I expected from my travels. I intended to be in Scotland some six weeks at least and to go to Haddington and Fife. But now it seems likely I shall have to return to London, almost immediately without having seen anyone but my Husbands relations in Dumfriesshire. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle remained behind at Chelsea having never recovered (<hi rend="italic">he says</hi>) from the knocking about he had last year in Scotland and Germany while the house was repairing He is very melancholy and helpless, left alone, at the best of <pb id="pg-28-202" n="28:202"/>times&#x2014;and now I am afraid he is going to have a great sorrow in the death of his old Mother. She has been in a frail way for years back but within the last few days her weakness has increased so much that D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle thinks it probable enough she may not rally again. In which case I shall go home at once to be some help to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle. I am staying now with D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s wife while he himself is gone to see his Mother&#x2014;and his report tonight will decide me what to do&#x2014; So in case I do not see you, dear Betty&#x2014;and I fear I shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> see you, here is a ribbon in remembrance of my birthday&#x2014;with a kiss and my blessing&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Erskine writes that he saw you and liked you very much<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine wrote from Edinburgh, <date when="1853-07-10">10 July</date>, that he &#x201C;had a sort of meeting with you through M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Braid whom I could have pressed to my heart, for her motherly love of you. &#x2026; [W]hen she found that I knew &#x26; loved you, she &#x2026; received me as if she had been always intimate with me.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;I am sure you would like him too&#x2014;</p>

<p>Just two hours before your letter came I heard thro my sister in law at Dumfries of your Husband&#x2019;s illness&#x2014;and was excessively vexed at having written to you at such a wrong moment&#x2014; I sincerely hope he continues mending and that I shall soon hear of his entire recovery Poor dear Woman! what a fright you must have had!

Old M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle fell so weak on Monday, that a letter was sent for D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle to come over, and he wrote last night that it was quite uncertain whether she could rally again or no. He will either come home today or write again; but I hardly expect she will be in a state to receive my visit even if she do recover to hold on to life a little longer&#x2014;and if her death is apprehended at present, I shall go straight back to London as quickly as possible to be there when my Husband gets the news. He is very fond of his Mother and tho&#x2019; prepared for never <pb id="pg-28-203" n="28:203"/>seeing her again he would be dreadfully depressed I know alone there, with such a sorrow&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Oh my Dear!</salute>
<p>I am so wearied and out of spirits and unfit for writing tonight! but if I don&#x2019;t write to you myself, John will, and I must save you from the comfortless feelings which a note of his, in his actual &#x201C;flight of crows&#x201C; state is sure to leave you with. I almost affronted him by insisting on his <hi rend="italic">not</hi> writing to you yesterday; taking the whole blame, if you found any, on myself, and now thank God I have reason to congratulate myself that you were so spared 24 hours of deadly anxiety. On Tuesday a few lines came from Isabella to the effect that your Mother was more weak than usual and he had better come over&#x2014; He went accordingly with the intention of staying all night, and returned home yesterday forenoon; seeing she was so poorly he said that he must go back after dinner and stay the night again. &#x201C;She had no new disease but was fallen into a fit of weakness from which she might not rally.&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">My</hi> visit had done her no harm <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was the only positive thing to be got out of him. The day after I was there she had been out of doors for a little walk&#x2014;Somehow I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not believe that she was so ill as he said&#x2014;and wishing to see her again in any case, and wishing also that you should learn her state on my own observation, I said that I would still go to Scotsbrig today&#x2014;only without baggage and to return here to sleep. So it was arranged that the gig should be sent to the Ecclefechan station for me at half after eleven. This morning before I was out of bed a note was brought me from Isabella which I shall inclose, and from which it appeared <hi rend="italic">she</hi> saw no reason why I should not come according to programme. I then regretted having been turned from my original plan. but it was necessary to stick to the second arrangement since I had made it. So I started from here with a headach in a pour of rain and found Jemmy<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle.</note> with a <pb id="pg-28-204" n="28:204"/>face of cordial welcome waiting with the gig. Before he left home your Mother had been out of bed for half an hour!! Wasn&#x2019;t I thankful I had not suffered John to write to you that he thought &#x201C;she would not rally.&#x201C; I found Jean and Jemmy Aitken there. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> poor soul <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been written to and had come in great fright. Your Mother was in bed, and very weak, but I declare to you her appearance pleased me better than on the former day. her eyes had a quiet natural look, and her colour was natural. She looked to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> like a person who had had a bilious crisis which was <hi rend="italic">past</hi>, and had left her cooler and calmer. She <hi rend="italic">chewed</hi> some nice mutton chop while I was there and said she hadn&#x2019;t felt so hungry for long. She spoke to me just as she used to do. indeed her faculties are as clear as yours or mine. The fact is as you need not to be told that she is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> frail, and any little accident, such as a pill failing, shakes her to pieces. I do not see how she could be made more comfortable&#x2014;her room is nicely carpeted and warm, and tidy&#x2014;and every attention seems to be paid to her. I shall be able to tell you more particulars the day after tomorrow&#x2014;for finding the posture of affairs I said I should return tomorrow to make my visit&#x2014; But that I needed to pack my trunks and take them away, I should have spared myself the fatigue and expense of the journey back. James Aitken left at the same time as John and I. Jean was to remain a few days&#x2014;so that I shant get much &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">silence</hi>&#x201C; I guess.</p>
<p>Jane Howden<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The da. of Dr. Thomas Howden, JWC&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s partner in Haddington (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200115-JBW-EA-01"><sic>1:219</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1820-01-01">1 Jan. 1820</date></corr></ref>).</note> writes that the Donaldsons will be quite glad to have me and that if I find them too frail &#x201C;my own house is as wide open to me as ever it was&#x201C;!! How would <hi rend="italic">that</hi> do? I have really some notion to go and try sleeping in the bedroom I used to sleep so soundly in! &#x201C;Blanche Airlie&#x201C;&#x2014; Good God! in this mood!&#x2014;&#x2014; I got your letter and the books from Jemmy at the station&#x2014;thank you for all you have done and all you intended&#x2014; A good letter like that was more needed than a present&#x2014; I wrote to offer a visit to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell! I wished to see Templand and Crawford but <hi rend="italic">her</hi> Husband has been lying between life and death for a fortnight.</p>
<p>Bad luck seems to attend me at present&#x2014; And on the whole I think it were safest perhaps to go right back to Chelsea&#x2014;as I had made up my mind to do had there been bad news to tell you of your Mother&#x2014;the idea of your hearing of her death, alone there, was too sad&#x2014; But I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> dreadfully tired for two nights I have had hardly any sleep&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wrote to Lady A for her Birthday&#x2014;happily I &#x201C;took time by the forelock&#x201C; and wrote on the 12<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, tho I dated my letter the 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi> otherwise in the alarm about your Mother and the intention of starting immediately for London I should have forgotten the memorable occasion</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Send me word again how you are;&#x2014;and let it be, that you are better, like a good fellow! I am alone here, these two weeks, and lead the most secluded, abstruse, silent and indescribable life; intent on burning off great quantities of rubbish and excrescence which has grown upon me dreadfully (to the length almost of total burying-alive) in late times. Which is not a joyful operation, I can assure you!</p>
<p>My Wife is in Scotland; will continue some weeks if she find it profit: at Moffat, Scotsbrig, &#x26;c, with what kindred she and I have still left in those parts. I myself say nothing of leaving Town; indeed, privately, I scheme not to do it at all,&#x2014;unless burnt out by summer droughts and blazing sun; of which there surely is no immediate prospect hitherto! If the Town were once what they call &#x201C;empty,&#x201C;&#x2014;free of <hi rend="italic">plush</hi> and roaring wheels, not to speak of the immense masses of stupidity that must also go,&#x2014;it will be one of the best discoverable places for study, for the burning of excrescences (<hi rend="italic">proud-flesh</hi>, among the number, alas!); and one may perhaps do a little good again after all. Heaven grant it; Heaven help us to compel it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am not equal to the least attempt at dinner (being really very unwell in body withal); but do mean and wish to attend you at tea some night, either in L.I.F.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >58 Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields, Forster&#x2019;s home.</note> or on your Hilltop (of which give me the address again),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Garth Hotel, Hampstead Heath. Forster had had rheumatic fever for about five months.</note>&#x2014;the former by preference:&#x2014;so pray tell me what possibilities there still are.</p>
<p>From the prophetic Delia Bacon, I heard thanks for your Payne-Collier Note (which was to be gratefully used <hi rend="italic">by and by</hi>);<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530611-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1853-06-11">11 June</date></ref>.</note> and have not heard a whisper since. Which is not extremely unfortunate for me; the prophetic Delia being somewhat <hi rend="italic">lengthy</hi>, I guess!</p>
<p>On the whole, dear Forster, tell me how you are,&#x2014;punctually,&#x2014;and know me always for one of the many anxious about you, and well affected towards such a British Subject as you have shewn yourself to us. And Heart up, my brave fellow! The longest lane <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a turning in it.</p>

<p>I will take this sheet ready addressed to Ecclefechan, and a pencil, and write you the news Jemmy brings to the Station of your Mother&#x2014;there may not be a chance to the post office in the afternoon&#x2014; This is St Swithin&#x2019;s day and &#x201C;it rains hale (whole?) water&#x201C;; as Helen<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell, their former maid. Rain on St. Swithin&#x2019;s Day, <date when="--07-15">15 July</date>, was supposed to mean rain for 40 days.</note> used to say. But I should go, if it rained brimstone. I dont think I ever felt more discouraged in all my life; and that is much to say! Do not suppose however that I am terribly &#x201C;others&#x201C; with my inward dismay&#x2014;I am sure neither John nor his wife have an idea how little satisfaction my visit has yielded me, or how little purpose I have of ever taxing their <hi rend="italic">hospitality</hi> again&#x2014; I have conducted myself with perfect politeness here&#x2014; And at Scotsbrig the impression is, I am &#x201C;as full of mettle as ever I was&#x201C;&#x2014;and I shall take care not to undeceive them. When one goes into other peoples houses one lays down ones privilege &#x201C;to be as ugly and stupid and disagreeable as one likes&#x201C;&#x2014;if one <hi rend="italic">have</hi> such a privilege even in one&#x2019;s own house, which &#x201C;may be strongly doubted.&#x201C;</p>
<p>You need not attach the slightest importance to anything John writes about your Mother. It is clear as day to me that he knows no more about her than any intelligent person beside her does, and can do no more for her than any intelligent person can do. And he talks talks about his own insight and his unheard of exertions in her behalf, in a way to confuse ones senses&#x2014; His Wife is always talking to him of his making himself a perfect Martyr to filial affection, and he accepts the merit with a fatuity! I beg of you to burn this letter and all I write at present&#x2014; Jemmy told me in secret that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had gone up to her room twice &#x201C;without a licht&#x201C; during the night before John went last; to listen to her breathing, and that she was &#x201C;a deal war&#x201C; than the last night when &#x201C;the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> threepit she wud hae died if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> hadna been there&#x201C;&#x2014; Margaret Austin who sleeps in the room with her thought the same&#x2014;Jemmy said that no mortal could tell one day how she was to be the next. her strength came and went with her spirits in such a wonderful way&#x2014;and I believe with him that no <hi rend="italic">doctoring</hi> is of any use to her but just constant kind attention which she seems to get. and she told me herself that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were very kind to her<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The writing of the last few lines is compressed, leaving no room for JWC&#x2019;s signature.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Please to accept many thanks for the Book you have given me, and very many more for the human goodwill you are never weary of expressing towards me in this and other ways. I should be a strange specimen of humanity if these things had not a value to me, did not secure some human gratitude from me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Book, I perceive, is full of solid healthy sense; honest piety, sagacity, goodnature; qualities which I can recognise, and need no precept to esteem, whatsoever vesture they put on: like all hearty sincere Books, it carries (elswhere than on the titlepage) its <hi rend="italic">date</hi>, both of place and time;&#x2014;and truly I can welcome it into the world, as a neighbour likely to be useful there, whether it agrees with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and the poor notions I have got to about the world, or altogether (at least on the surface)&#x2014;agrees with me and them! This, I assure you, is the truth.</p>
<p>I cannot flatter myself it would repay you to come so far for the sake of seeing me; but if you did at any time, it could not be other than welcome to me.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And so, with many thanks,</salute></closer></p>

<dateline><place>Chelsea</place>, Monday, <date when="1853-07-18">18 july, 1853</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>Thank you many times, dear Jeannie, for the kind and punctual Notes you sent;</salute> very valuable to me in many ways. The first came on Friday night,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">after</hi> the last chance I had of getting a Letter conveyed to you till Monday (thanks to the Scotch Agnewites, and <hi rend="italic">less</hi> power to their elbow, the dirty Pharisees!),&#x2014;so, with new protest on the Saturday night when your second Note came, I had to be silent till now.&#x2014; Undoubtedly you kept a most desolate 24 hours off me by suppressing John&#x2019;s message: my poor Mother, my poor old Mother&#x2014;but what can we say or do! Send me, and bring me, the faithfullest account of her you can;&#x2014;above all things, if there is any good I could do her, <pb id="pg-28-208" n="28:208"/>any little gift I could make her&#x2014; But, alas, I fear there is none. Oh be you good and kind and patient to her;&#x2014;I know you will. And stay there <hi rend="italic">as long</hi> as you can find it good, on candid survey of the ground; that is still my advice to you. We have here all last week, and over into this, the wettest weather ever seen: deluges of rain think nothing of continuing for 16 hours; yesterday was dry, windy, and inexpressibly bright; but today it is <foreign><hi rend="italic">clashing</hi></foreign> and showering again. If you have it so at Scotsbrig, that will be a great drawback; and you cannot judge of the place, or its capabilities as a lodging, on those terms.</p>
<p>Unless your own mind strongly carries you towards it, I do not advise Haddington. You will have 100 miles, twice over, of <foreign><hi rend="italic">clatching</hi></foreign> in railways to do for sake of it: last time it was all a city of the mind,&#x2014;left <hi rend="italic">beautiful</hi> to you to think of;&#x2014;a second visit may alter that, but cannot mend that. Nor am I, at heart, sorry about Thornhill: little but sad tears could await you there,&#x2014;why <hi rend="italic">seek</hi> these in a world otherwise so copious in them? Crawford we will go to, one day; <hi rend="italic">we</hi>, I say, when things are come straight again: there is nothing of <hi rend="italic">mean</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">un</hi>holy to be met with <hi rend="italic">there;</hi> and it is human and fit that one should make such pilgrimages. It is very accessible from where you are, a stage beyond Moffat on the railway: but you must not go without me, at least not yet.&#x2014; &#x2014; These are my thoughts, given to you: but you know, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are mistress, and alone capable of ultimately choosing in such a case. Parliament won&#x2019;t rise, I hear, till towards the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of <date when="1853-08">August</date>: no Ferguses, therefore;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Fergus was MP for Fife and so would not be in Kirkcaldy.</note>&#x2014;and indeed I doubt much if they would have suited greatly. On the whole, do not many things point even to that issue (the welcomest of all to the Unprotected here),&#x2014;making up your packages where you are, and coming home again! Your rooms are, or can instantly be, all right here;&#x2014;and I shall be very happy to divide with Nero what <foreign><hi rend="italic">tewheets</hi></foreign> he has caught (the villian)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> so soon as ever he likes. That is certain, you can tell him.</p>
<p>I am very solitary here; sometimes in mood rather <hi rend="italic">ghastly</hi>,&#x2014;but I really think, on the whole, getting rather better in health by such still life. I see few, nobody that does me good; and brood over a most waste continent of thoughts indeed, for most part. My sleep is not bad, considering; Fanny (for an irrational creature) is really very good; all smiles, promptitude and serviceability. Living is: <foreign><hi rend="italic">scrag</hi></foreign> as hertofore,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> now hot, now cold with ham to it; small handful of peas, and bit of steeped bread. Which really does as well as anything.</p>

Unhappily <pb id="pg-28-209" n="28:209"/>Helps, while we talked, came in; and things got into a screwed condition. One day I met Senior on the street: &#x201C;Dine with us tomorrow,&#x201C;&#x2014;<foreign>Ach, Nein</foreign>!

<p>On one point I expect to surprise you: A Cubitt Builder<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520813-TC-JWC-01"><sic>27:225</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1852-08-13">13 Aug. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> is actually coming here (the unwearied swift Chorley has investigated and searched him out) to give me an exact survey, with exact estimate (<hi rend="italic">time</hi>, money &#x26;c) of an impenetrably <hi rend="italic">deaf</hi> apart<hi rend="italic">t</hi> up aloft! I hardly think I shall dare to <hi rend="italic">build</hi> just yet, after all. But these summer noises, in some of my neuralgic moods, drive me upon such speculations.

<p>I dare say you have thought me very neglectful Dear in not writing yesterday, to give you news of your Mother; but there was nothing comfortable or even positive to be said yesterday, and to torture you at a distance with miserable uncertainty seemed a cruel attention. Thro&#x2019; Saturday and Sunday your Mother continued much the same as I found her on my last coming. Too weak and frail to be out of bed; but without pain or sickness&#x2014;for the rest perfectly clear in her mind, and liking us to be in the room talking to her. During the Sunday night, she became very restless and about seven on Monday morning she fell into a state which was considered by all here, the <hi rend="italic">Minister</hi> included, to be the beginning of the end&#x2014; There was no pain no struggle&#x2014; She lay without sense or motion, cold and deathlike, hardly breathing at all&#x2014; The Minister prayed without her hearing him&#x2014; John and Mary were sent for with scarce a hope that they could arrive in time and all of us sat in solemn silence awaiting the end&#x2014; Had it come thus, you would have had no cause to lament Dear, a more merciful termination there could not have been to a good Life. But after lying in this state from seven in the morning till a quarter after two in the day&#x2014;she rallied as by miracle&#x2014;Jane was wiping her lips with a wet sponge when she (your Mother) suddenly took the sponge out of Jane&#x2019;s hand and sponged her face all over with her own hand then she opened her eyes, and spoke quite collectedly as if nothing had <pb id="pg-28-211" n="28:211"/>happened; nor has she ever shown the least consciousness of having come thro&#x2019; that fearful crisis. When John and Mary arrived together at a quarter after four, not expecting to find her alive they found her a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> weaker perhaps, but not otherwise worse than when they left her. She talked a good deal to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> during the afternoon, said you had been as good a son to her as ever woman had&#x2014;&#x201C;but indeed they had been all good <foreign>bairns</foreign>&#x2014;and Isabella <foreign>puir bodie</foreign>, was <foreign>guy</foreign> distressed hersell and it was just to say, that Isabella had been often kind to her, extrordnar kind&#x2014;and was ay kindest when they were alain thegither, and she had none else to depend on.&#x201C;&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">That</hi> I can well believe!&#x2014;and very glad I was to have those kind words to carry to Jamie and Isabella&#x2014; Isabella had been crying all morning; for since Jane came your Mother had hardly spoken to her. When I left your Mother that night. she said in a clear loud voice &#x201C;I thank ye most kindly for all yeer attentions&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh if I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> but do you any good.&#x201C; I said. &#x201C;Ye <hi rend="italic">have</hi> done me good&#x2014;mony a time,&#x201C; she answered. I went to bed to lie awake all night listening for noises&#x2014;John slept in the midroom&#x2014; But the light of a new day found your Mother better rather than worse&#x2014; It was more the recollection of the state in which she <hi rend="italic">had been</hi> than her actual state that kept us in agitation all yesterday&#x2014;one thing that leads me to believe her life will be prolonged is that she recovered out of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> crisis, by the <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> strength that was still in her she must have been <hi rend="italic">much</hi> stronger than anyone thought to have rallied after so many hours of such deathlike prostration&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">entirely of herself</hi>. She had been in the habit of getting what seems to me perfectly extraordinary quantities of wine, whisky and porter exciting a false strength not to be depended on for an hour&#x2014; Of late days this system has discontinued and she takes now only little drops of wine and water two or three times a day and about the third of a Tumbler of guiness&#x2019; porter at night. The day that John was sent for last week he told me himself she had &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">bottle</hi> of wine (strong greek wine) a quarter of a bottle of whisky (25 over proof) besides a tumbler of porter!&#x201C;&#x2014; A life kept up in that way was neither to be depended on nor I should say to be desired&#x2014; Now she is living on her own strength such as it is and you may conceive what irritation is removed&#x2014;</p>
<p>I dont know whether it is to be considered lucky or unlucky that I came at this time&#x2014; Of course I give as little trouble as possible and make myself as useful as possible&#x2014; And I feel sure that <hi rend="italic">Jamie</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Isabella like</hi> me to be here even under these sad circumstances&#x2014;and that the sight of me coming and going in her room does your Mother good rather than harm&#x2014;and then I shall be able to answer all your questions about her when I come back, better than the others could do by letter. For the rest; I doubt not I am in <hi rend="italic">John&#x2019;s</hi> way, and perhaps a little in <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi>&#x2019;s, as I absolutely decline entering into her <hi rend="italic">views</hi> of Jamie and Isabella&#x2014;who as I told herself had never either of <hi rend="italic">them</hi> said to me <pb id="pg-28-212" n="28:212"/>one unkind word about <hi rend="italic">her</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This sentence is omitted in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>. Evidently Jean (Jane) Carlyle Aitken and Isabella disagreed.</note> As for Mary she is the same kindly soul as I knew her at Craigenputtoch&#x2014; Jamie was to have driven me over to the Gill on Monday and instead the empty gig was sent to bring Mary here&#x2014; She ran out of the house to meet <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and was told her Mother was at the point of death&#x2014; She is still here but goes home tomorrow I believe, and John goes back to Moffat today&#x2014; He will probably be down again tomorrow&#x2014; It is a comfort to himself to come&#x2014;but he can <hi rend="italic">do</hi> nothing&#x2014;no D<hi rend="italic">r can</hi> do anything against old age&#x2014;which is your Mothers whole disease&#x2014;</p>
<p>I shall be home one of these days any little spirits for visiting and travelling that I had left are completely worn out by what I have found here. I only wait till things are reestablished in a state in which I can leave with comfort&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have just been to see if your Mother had awoke&#x2014; She has slept two hours&#x2014;I asked her if she had any message for you&#x2014;and she said &#x201C;none I am afraid that he will like to hear&#x2014;for he&#x2019;ll be sorry that Im so frail&#x201C;&#x2014; She had had some chicken broth&#x2014; I will write after tomorrow&#x2014;and I beseech you not to be fancying her ill off in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> way. She has no pain, no anxiety of mind&#x2014;is more comfortable really, lying in bed there &#x201C;so frail,&#x201C; than we have often seen her going about after her work. She is attended to every moment of the day&#x2014;gets every thing she is able to take&#x2014; No one can predict as to the length of her life after what we saw on Monday&#x2014;but there is <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> in her <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> state or appearance to make it impossible or even improbable that she should live a long time yet&#x2014;</p>
<p>I would much rather <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have written today&#x2014;but I judged that my silence might alarm you even more than the truth told you&#x2014; I like few things worse than writing ill news</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to write today, dear, your Mother is so well. She went to sleep last night about 8 o&#x2019;clock, and slept a fine natural &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">pluffing</hi></foreign>&#x201C; sleep till one in the morning, when she awoke and asked for some porridge, which having taken she went to sleep again, and slept till six in the morning. Then she opened her eyes and said to write a line to &#x201C;the Doctor&#x201C; by the train to tell him &#x201C;no to come back th&#x2019; day; for at weel<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;That well; very certainly&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> she wasna needing him.&#x201C; then off to sleep again till half after nine!&#x2014; I was sitting at her bedside when she woke up then quite fresh, and her first word was, &#x201C;did they send a bit line to the Doctor to bid him no come&#x201C;? Her going on hitherto is all confirmatory of my first impression, that it could not be <hi rend="italic">for nothing</hi> that she had come out of that deathlike trance thro&#x2019; her own unassisted strength&#x2014;but that she was going to have a new lease of life with better health than before <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have not seen her so well as she is today since I came to the country and Jane says <hi rend="italic">she</hi> has not seen her so well since candlemas and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Tait<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Tait (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867">67</date>), minister at the Ecclefechan Burgher church since <date when="1840">1840</date>; &#x201C;the clergyman&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> told me an hour ago <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had not seen her so well for eight weeks. And she has not had a drop of wine or whisky or any of those horrible stimulants today so that one is sure the <hi rend="italic">wellness</hi> is <hi rend="italic">real</hi>. It was put in my power &#x201C;quite promiscuously&#x201C; to give her a little pleasure this morning. I &#x201C;do all the <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> of the family&#x201C; at present&#x2014;carry all the letters back wards and forwards like a regular postwoman&#x2014;of my own free will of course&#x2014;for Jamie would send to Middlebie or Ecclefechan at any time for me&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can be best spared to go, and I like it. Since I came here I &#x201C;have been known&#x201C; to walk to Ecclefechan and back again <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> in one day!! and most times I get an old man for company. different old men attach themselves to me&#x2014;like lovers&#x2014;and I find their innocent talk very refreshing&#x2014; This morning I went to Middlebie as usual on the chance of a letter from you, and the Post as usual not being come&#x2014;(I always go far too soon) I walked on as usual, and met the Postman halfway to Ecclefechan&#x2014; Coming back reading your notes, I met three or four women, one of whom stopt me to inquire for your Mother. then she left her companions and turned back with me telling me about <hi rend="italic">her</hi> Mother how ill <hi rend="italic">she</hi> had been last week&#x2014;and that she would &#x201C;like weel to ken what I thocht o&#x2019; her looks compared wi M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Cairls&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Low Annandale for &#x2018;Carlyle&#x2019;s&#x2019;&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note>&#x2014;and when we arrived at a farm house on the Ecclefechan side of the Mill she <pb id="pg-28-214" n="28:214"/>begged me as a great favour &#x201C;just to step in and take a look o&#x2019; her Mother and say what I thocht&#x201C;&#x2014; I did not refuse of course; but went in and sat a while beside a good patient looking old woman in the bed&#x2014;who asked many questions about your Mother and told me much about herself&#x2014; When I came in and described where I had been; it turned out I had brought your Mother the very information she had been asking of all the rest yesterday with no result&#x2014;and she had left off saying &#x201C;naebody cared for auld folk now a days&#x2014;or some o them would hae gaen an asket for puir M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Corrie&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the wife of Sandy Corrie of Newfield, 2&#xBD; mi.

<p>I must write to Thomas Erskine today<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine wrote, <date when="1853-07-10">10 July</date>, that he had passed Moffat &#x201C;rapidly the other day. &#x2026; I did not know of your being there, till a letter from your husband informed me of his state in the <hi rend="italic">thoroughly repaired</hi> house, &#x26; of your emigration northwards.&#x201C; He hoped for &#x201C;the great pleasure of a sight&#x201C; of JWC, and asked for &#x201C;a good long letter&#x2014;about your past present &#x26; future.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;and to Liverpool to tell them they may look for me anyday&#x2014;with John hovering about &#x201C;not like one crow but a whole flight of crows,&#x201C; and Jane rubbing everything up the wrong way of the hair; my position is not so tenable as it would have been alone with your Mother and Jamie and Isabella But I could not have gone with comfort to myself while your Mother was in so critical a state&#x2014; I shall probably go to Liverpool tomorrow or next day. at all events you had best write there&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am decidedly of opinion that one should make oneself <hi rend="italic">independent</hi> of Roncas<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Ronca, inhabitant of the then dilapidated No. 6 next door, who nearly killed us with poultry and other noises! The &#x2018;sound-proof room&#x2019; was a flattering delusion of an ingenious needy builder, for which we afterwards paid dear. Being now fairly in for &#x2018; Frederick,&#x2019; and the poultry, parrots, Cochin China, and vermin like to drive one mad, I at last gave in to the seducer, set him to work on the top of the house story as floor, and got a room, large, well ventilated, but by far the noisiest in the house, and in point of bad building, scamping, and enormity of new expense and of unexpected bad behaviour in hand and heart by his man and him, a kind of infernal &#x2018;miracle&#x2019; to me then and ever since; my first view of the Satan&#x2019;s invisible world that prevails in that department as in others&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> and all contingencies by building the soundproof room&#x2014;since so much money has already been spent on <hi rend="italic">that</hi> house&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Clough,</salute>
<p>You need not be told I am delighted at the conclusion you have come to;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To stay in England and take an examinership from <date when="1853-07-25">25 July</date> in the education dept. of the privy council office, at &#xa3;300 a year (<hi rend="italic">Clough</hi> 2:457).</note> for my own sake and for yours, I could not wish any other result;&#x2014;and in fact I believe it will turn out to have been the wise decision. May you never repent it:&#x2014;in which case, England and the rest of us will be very far from doing so!</p>
<p>I have been scheming out some evening for a talk with you, or perhaps been lazily in hope you would come of your own accord. At 3 p.m. any day I am here: but all my evenings now, I find, till monday are taken up: on and after monday the natural course of solitude returns. I expect my wife home very soon; and do not as yet contemplate any travelling this year.</p>
<p>Come the first day or night you can.</p>

I suppose I may, without shame or confusion of face, profess myself gratified by such a recommendation from such a quarter. Criticisms from two classes of people, from natural blockheads, and even from persons of talent who have not taken the pains to be sincere and make up a definite coherent judgement, are of no value to gods or men: but it is otherwise with criticisms from a certain other class of people; and to that class emphatically I value the judgement in question. Truth, practical sagacity, honest good sense speaks from every line of it;&#x2014;and in fact, taking in the Writer&#x2019;s point of view, I have not, in the way of objection, a word to say,&#x2014;only here and there a little <hi rend="italic">blushing</hi> to do! I perceive farther we are a Penny Tract, and will fly extensively over the world. Better that the thing have <pb id="pg-28-216" n="28:216"/>some truth in it in such case, than that it have none!&#x2014; Well, well: the citizens empty their vessels according to their pleasure; &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Gare de l&#x2019;eau</hi></foreign>,&#x201C; [mind the water] according to Miss Jenkins,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Winifred Jenkins is the comic servant in Tobias Smollett&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Humphry Clinker</hi> (<date when="1771">1771</date>). &#x201C;Gardy-loo&#x201C; was said to be the warning cry in Edinburgh as slop pails were once emptied at night from upstairs windows; from &#x201C;guarde l&#x2019;eau.&#x201C;</note> signifies, &#x201C;May the Lord have mercy upon you.&#x201C; If among so many malodorous unutterabilities, a little clean water or <foreign><hi rend="italic">eau de Cologne</hi></foreign> descend, who shall say it is not to be welcomed?&#x2014;</p>

<dateline><place>Chelsea</place>, <date when="1853-07-22">23 [22] july, 1853</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p>Thank you very much, my Dear, for your judicious &#x26; kind attention in writing, and in not writing. You may judge with what feelings I read your letter last night, and again and again read it; how anxiously I expect what you will say tonight! If I had indeed <hi rend="italic">known</hi> what was going on during Monday, what would have become of me that day?&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> everything by your description, as if I looked at it with my own eyes: my poor beloved good old mother! Things crowd round me in my solitude, old reminiscences from the very beginnings of my life: it is very beautiful, if it is so sad, sad; and I have nothing to say,&#x2014;I, like all mortals, have to feel the Inexorable that there is in Life, and to say as piously as I can, God&#x2019;s will, God&#x2019;s will. Ah me, ah me!&#x2014; Upon the whole, I am glad you went there at this time. If you could only begin to <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, I should be thankful to have you there in my own absence. Write to me, do not fail to write, while you continue.&#x2014; Was not that a beautiful old Mother&#x2019;s message: &#x201C;None, I&#x2019;m afraid, that he would like to hear!&#x201C;&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sunt lachrymae rerum</hi></foreign>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Tears are due to such things&#x201C;; <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> 1:462.</note></p>
<p>I am grieved to hear of your want of sleep. Try I beg of you; and by no means give it up &#x201C;till you come home!&#x201C; There is absolute quiet to be had in your room (especially if you will <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> Jamie or Isabella of it) from 10 o&#x2019;clock til 5, while the <pb id="pg-28-217" n="28:217"/>people are asleep: after that, I believe, quiet is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> attainable at all. You need not be apprehensive of <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi> where you are; she really likes you, and has good insight, tho&#x2019; capable of strong prepossessions. John, even if you were in his way (which I do not think at all), has nothing to do with it. The rest are loyal to you to the bone. <hi rend="italic">Rest</hi> then till you get back to me; I shall long greatly to hear you have got a little sleep; and this evening&#x2019;s Letter, I hope, will bring me that good news.&#x2014; &#x2014; Surely, as you say, it was quite wrong to give such quantities of <hi rend="italic">wine</hi> &#x26;c to an old weak person. I hope and trust, John has entirely abandoned that system: it is a purchasing of momentary relief at a price which must be ruinous.</p>
<p>I have done my task today again: but I had drugs in me, and am not in a very vigorous humour. My &#x201C;task&#x201C; is a most dreary one: I am too <hi rend="italic">old</hi> for blazing up round this Fritz and his affairs; and I see it will be a dreadful job to <hi rend="italic">riddle</hi> his History into purity and consistency, out of the endless rubbish of so many dullards as have treated of it: but I will <hi rend="italic">try</hi>, too; I cannot yet quite afford to be <hi rend="italic">beaten:</hi> and truly there is no other thing attainable to me in life except even my poor scantling of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> such as it may be. If I can <hi rend="italic">work</hi> no more, what is the good of <hi rend="italic">me</hi> farther? We shall all have a right deep sleep by and by, my own little Jeannie; thou wilt lie quiet beside me there in the divine bosom of Eternity, if never in the diabolic whirl of Time any more!&#x2014; But this is too sad a saying; tho&#x2019; to me it is blessed and indubitable as well as sad.</p>
<p>I know not if my poor mother can <hi rend="italic">read</hi> now at all tell me if she ever can of late. I had sent yesterday two Books, which were good for nothing. Last night this &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Penny Tract</hi>&#x201C; came; addressed in Chambers&#x2019;s hand, from Edinburgh: it seems written by Chambers himself, at any rate it is worth sending, and will fill an hour for you when you have nothing better to do.</p>
<p>The Builder has sent in his plan: decidedly a good and promising <hi rend="italic">soundless room;</hi> size 19ft by 21, &#x26; 14 high at the very highest; cost total &#xa3;169; time &#x201C;six weeks.&#x201C; Of course I will do nothing in it till you come, if then anything, at least immediately. This is really a <hi rend="italic">nice room</hi> now, or you will soon make it such. Not the least <hi rend="italic">paint</hi>-smell or other mischief remains in your room; which Fanny shall have <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> as Spring water for you ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> your coming; and the silence at night is <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> or about it.</p>
<p>I called at the Fergus&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >11 Hereford St.</note> one day; found Eliz<hi rend="italic">th</hi> &#x26; Jessie; strove to be agreeable; and&#x2014;caught a &#x201C;private-dinner invitation!&#x201C; Alas, that comes the night after tomorrow.

<p>Welcome to Liverpool again, my good little Jeannie, where I hope this scrap will be given you tomorrow morning. I am sorry thy bit <hi rend="italic">Tour</hi> has been so curtailed and obstructed: but right glad thou art on the way home again! It is an &#x201C;unprotected&#x201C; household, and but a desolate way of living, otherwise.</p>
<p>I wrote yesterday, at greater length, to Scotsbrig; but I know not whether you were still there to get the Letter: <hi rend="italic">yours</hi> from the North don&#x2019;t arrive till 6; after which date all is already <hi rend="italic">underway</hi>, and no answer to be sent.&#x2014; &#x2014; Judge if I was glad of last night&#x2019;s Letter! It was like balm to my wounded life. Fanny making some delay, I started up from my dinner; snatched the precious Note: &#x201C;all well&#x201C; round the seal, how good and considerate; thanks especially for those two words! My poor old Mother seems better for the present; and this <hi rend="italic">view</hi> of her state, and innocent feeble way of existence, which I have got thro&#x2019; your eyes, is truly a possession to me,&#x2014;better than if I had got it with my own eyes, in my present state of infirmity of nerves.&#x2014; Come home; tell us by what train; and I will be in waiting for you at the station, and all shall be trimmed up here according to Fanny&#x2019;s best skill. Of her really (considering that she is Irish, and the truth or the tidiness not <hi rend="italic">in</hi> her) I have nothing but praise to give since you went away: she has really served me well, and with her best ability always.</p>
<p>The Town is getting very thin, within the last week,&#x2014;thank Heaven for such prospect of quiet! Perhaps we shall get a little work done, were the noise once laid; a poor human creature <hi rend="italic">has</hi> then a better chance, I hope!&#x2014; Tonight I have an Asiatic-Society Reunion at Bath House (Lord A. Presid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of said society), I fancy a very flat thing; tomorrow at 6 the sad Fergus dinner;&#x2014;and then nothing more of that kind. The weather, not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> rain till very lately, is dry and bright today; beautiful in an extreme degree, as I took my short morning run: <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of my outer blinds are closed, not more, for there is yet no heat to be sick under. Poor Fuz&#x2019;s Note came this morning; we will go together to him.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster had been ill.</note> Other news I have none.&#x2014; I am but ill in the liver regions; have scantily, with difficulty made out my <hi rend="italic">stint</hi> of work; and cannot boast of exuberant capabilities, but they will <hi rend="italic">do</hi>.

<p>Poor little soul, you are in a bad way, with those false doses of morphine, with those sad <hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi>. I am quite grieved to think of such sleeplessness and botheration! There will be nothing for it, but <hi rend="italic">come home</hi> to me, come home. Your room shall be as clean as a new penny; air in abundance, without noise of any kind <hi rend="italic">till</hi> 9 a.m. (and this morning, I <hi rend="italic">refused</hi> all cocks till almost 10,&#x2014;having <hi rend="italic">smoked</hi> between six and 7): furthermore the weather is temperate and pleasant;&#x2014;and the &#x201C;Town is getting empty, &#x201C; and quiet Autumn just at hand. Lastly, Edwardes &#x201C;the little Darling&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Her name for a neat and good old gardener that used to work for us&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:51).</note> has trimmed up all the garden for you; I let him in, this morning, myself, the little Darling, and he is just finishing, and all is very nice indeed. Come, come and see,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">at once</hi>, if you are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sleeping; but surely, I hope, <hi rend="italic">last</hi> night has been a little better; surely I shall hear a little better news tomorrow, and from your own hand, at 11 o&#x2019;clock? If you are getting <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, if you find it <hi rend="italic">useful</hi>, of course stay for a day or two; but I think you won&#x2019;t.</p>

Pbd: Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:231&#x2013;33. &#x201C;A letter, perhaps two letters, seem to be lost here, which contained painful and yet beautiful and honestly pathetic details of her quitting Scotsbrig before the time looked for, and on grounds which had not appeared to her, nor to anybody except my brother John, to be really necessary in such a fashion. It is certain all the rest at Scotsbrig (Jamie and Isabella especially, her hosts there) were vexed to the heart, as she could herself notice; and her own feeling of the matter was sorrowful and painful, and continued so in a degree, ever after, when it rose to memory. My dear little heavy-laden, tender-hearted, &#x2018;worn and weary,&#x2019; fellow pilgrim, feet bleeding by the way over the thorns of this bewildered earth. Of this weeping all the way to Carlisle, on quitting one&#x2019;s fatherland, I surely remember another letter to have said (in the words of a foolish song then current)&#x2014; And I left my youth behind For somebody else to find, which gave the last sad touch to the picture. In one of her letters to me it indubitably was. &#x2018;Sophy,&#x2019; an orphan half-cousin, to whom and to her mother Uncle John&#x2019;s munificence had been fatherly and princely, was now, and still continues, Alick Welsh&#x2019;s good and amiable wife.

<salute>My dear Jamie</salute>
<p>I would have written yesterday to assure you all of my safe arrival, if I hadn&#x2019;t been clean past writing yesterday in fact laid on my back with a sick fit. That Express from Carlisle does fly at a terrible rate! My head was quite light with it when I reached Maryland Street at six oclock. I found the house door and windows there being painted; so it had been settled I was to sleep at my Cousin Alicks to be put out of the smell&#x2014; Alick and his wife were waiting to take me home with them&#x2014; I drank a tumbler of porter before going to bed, and there was perfect quietness. I should have slept with sheer fatigue if the Devil hadn&#x2019;t been in me. But I couldn&#x2019;t lie still five minutes spent the night in lighting matches to see myself awake!&#x2014;towards morning I took, the more fool I, a double doze of Morphia&#x2014;which made me so sick! oh so sick! and all yesterday I lay in bed retching and fainting by turns. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Alick good little soul doctored me according to her ability which was not so bad&#x2014;last night I got some sleep and today I am quite well again, only <hi rend="italic">not</hi> strong enough for bathing in a Lynn<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A waterfall near Scotsbrig.</note> and walking from Scotsbrig to Ecclefechan twice in one day. <pb id="pg-28-223" n="28:223"/>There was a letter from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C yesterday morning all well at Chelsea&#x2014; Poor Nero has had a miserable time since he left Ecclefechan&#x2014;no exercise and a little Sky Terrier here who worries him into convulsions of cowardice I hope to find a line from Scotsbrig at Maryland this morning&#x2014;surely your Mother must have been well refreshed by that twelve hours sleep on Friday night kind remembrances to all&#x2014;Nero joins me in the heartiest thanks to yourself and Isabella for your kindness at all times when I am with you</p>

<p>Thanks for your little word, this morning; a word is always a word, and welcome with its kind tidings into one&#x2019;s solitude here. So you are not coming on Thursday, after all,&#x2014;you faithless little woman? I think it is a shame not to come to your own house, when all are waiting for you; and Fanny, I see, has put on a clean coverlid, and the little Darling has shaved the beard of the garden, and left it in solitary expectation here!&#x2014; My dear little Jeannie, if you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> like to be better where you are, or wish in any way to stay till Friday, Saturday or Monday, of course do it, and I will not say a word. But I had set myself to think of Thursday; and must confess a little disappointment, however we may arrange it now.</p>
<p>I was cursorily asked (in a tone of pique and pet partially perceptible) if I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come to Addiscombe for Saturday; but I did not definitely answer Yes; and I did not mean to go if you were here. This you may think a compliment, sacrifice, or what else you like: but the fact is, I did not, and do not, <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to go; and should decidedly prefer a good excuse for not going, in the humour I am in, to the kind of business it is like to be. Venables, Brookfield, Lushington<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prof. Edmund Law Lushington (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893">93</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17210"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), prof. of Greek at Glasgow, friend of FitzGerald, Tennyson, and James Spedding; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430827-TC-JF-01"><sic>17:86</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1843-08-27">27 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x26;c, two days of idleness, two nights of bad sleep&#x2014;<foreign>Ach Gott</foreign>, I am not in a mood for benefit from all that; and know not now what I shall decide on!&#x2014; The truth is, I am very low &#x26; sad; find in the Heaven or in the Earth, as it were, one resource for me, that of trying to do a little work; and <hi rend="italic">work</hi> more unmanageable, dreary and ungenial to me I have not often had! I will not call myself, unhappy either; my mind begins to be occasionally alive again; and, in the gaunt vacancies where I dwell, a voice of grim monition speaks to me at times. I will have this accursed Prussian lumber shoved off my heart, in some way; I must fight as for life there and otherwise, if I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> live at all.&#x2014; In brief, if you settle to come on Friday, I will still write <hi rend="italic">no</hi> to Addiscombe: after Friday I cannot <hi rend="italic">send</hi> excuse; but the prophecy of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of course serve equally for that, and could be sent on Friday. Lady A., it seems, is already <hi rend="italic">gone</hi> to Addiscombe, and only the Master of the Household now here, off and on. I called yesterday with Neuberg&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Print</hi> message (which happily was addressed to <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi> A.), and found this state of matters, and &#x201C;Lordship gone out&#x201C;;&#x2014;with no answer hitherto.&#x2014; Do as you like, as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> like best, my poor little Jeanny dear; and I will manage the remainder <hi rend="italic">some</hi> way, the least difficult way, if I can hit it. And write at any rate; do not grudge me a little writing!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-225" n="28:225"/>I am better today than I was yesterday: but the cocks awoke me (by mistake) ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 8,&#x2014;and I was not asleep till after 3;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">hence</hi> some of these sorrows. I foresee in general these cocks will require to be abolished; entirely <hi rend="italic">silenced</hi> whether we build the new room or not. I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> cheerfully shoot them (and pay the price, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> discovered); but I have no gun, should be unsafe for hitting,&#x2014;and indeed seldom <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the wretched animals. Failing everything, I see dimly the <foreign><hi rend="italic">ultima ratio</hi></foreign> [final reckoning]; and wish I had, in my drawer, what of mineral or vegetable extract w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do the fatal deed! Truly I think often it will need to be <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, if nothing else can. A man is not a Chatham; not a Wallenstein;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. Albrecht Eusebius Wenzel von Wallenstein (<date when="1583">1583</date>&#x2013;<date when="1634">1634</date>), duke of Friedland and Mecklenburg.</note> but a man has to work too, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the Powers would not quite wish to have suppressed by two-and sixpence worth of bantams! Oh my dear, my dear,&#x2014;I am a most unvictorious man, <hi rend="italic">surely!</hi> But in fact it were better not to have written today (except for disappointing you),&#x2014;not till tomorrow, when sleep, and a little more fresh broth and scrag, shall have done their salutary work.&#x2014; I have been considerably tumbled round by these two dinners; especially by Brookfield&#x2019;s, which rose in sheer imbecillity on my side. A man <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to say &#x201C;No&#x201C; withal. Brookfield, I begin to see, is questionable on some sides. A palpable <hi rend="italic">parasite</hi>, for one thing; lays on his flattery <hi rend="italic">too</hi> thick (for my taste); seems of angry nature internally,&#x2014;and has many semi-blockheads hovering about him. Enough, enough as a rule for <hi rend="italic">dining</hi>, surely!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Last night there came a farther Note from John; <hi rend="italic">continuation</hi>, I perceive, of what you sent me. Things still as they were; Mother <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> much; pain-free, cheerful,&#x2014;&#x201C;perhaps a little weaker.&#x201C; I see he thinks she is dying: God only knows,&#x2014;my dear old Mother, the first and the last that truly loved one here below (so whispers the weak heart; and a <hi rend="italic">dew</hi> as of tears falls over the long-arid wilderness): but one is not to <hi rend="italic">rebel</hi> against the Law of Nature; one has to submit to it, and feel it to be the <hi rend="italic">best</hi>. I will ask you many questions if you were here: truly I am glad you saw that scene, and can impart it to me as if I had seen it. God is Great; God is Great,&#x2014;and, in a stern way, <hi rend="small-caps">Good</hi>. Let us never doubt that, never or we shall go <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>.</p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>More than once I had been asking myself what was become of you; but, of course, without any answer except from the echoes, till your Letter arrived on Monday last. I am very sorry to hear of all those physical afflictions, which have defaced the beauty of the German summer for you; I can well understand, too, by experience of my own, what a sad reflexion it is that takes possession of a human soul in those circumstances, &#x201C;Alas, I am <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the crown of the hill, then; and only deeper and deeper descent is now possible for me: and this is all that life would yield, the very measurable <hi rend="italic">this!</hi>&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg had written, <date when="1853-07-22">22 July</date>, of various illnesses: &#x201C;All which I take to be an intelligible hint that my &#x2018;heights,&#x2019; such as they are, have already been passed, and that I am henceforth to bear myself as one that walks downwardly.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-227" n="28:227"/>Nevertheless we must not be discouraged: the descent too has its beauties, pious and solemn, if less noisy and flaring than the uphill journey was; and a man <hi rend="italic">is</hi> under the great blue Heaven in all stages, till he die, and after too. Courage, courage!&#x2014; As to these complicated ailments, &#x201C;action of the heart&#x201C; &#x26;c, I confess my own theory for the present is, they are perhaps nothing, one and all of them, but <hi rend="italic">deranged liver;</hi> a most Protean, but also a very curable or assuageable ailment; and I hope confidently the Kissingen Waters<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bad Kissingen, a spa 62 mi. E of Frankfurt.</note> will bring you very speedy relief. Another great and necessary recipe in advancing years is, To lay oneself up for <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> whenever rest is useful, to secure a good &#x201C;dry dock,&#x201C;&#x2014;a permanent place of residence namely; which brings with it the total cessation of a huge crowd of <hi rend="italic">little</hi> annoyances, and clears the air very much altogether <hi rend="italic">laying</hi> one kind of dust. As I think you have now made your choice between England and Germany, I recommend (what doubtless is your own purpose), as the duty first in order, a vigorous attention to this of setting up a permanent house again, and arranging it to fit your own shape in all ways. This you will find a very great alleviation, and a true <hi rend="italic">composing medicine</hi> in many essential respects.&#x2014; I hope you will be luckier in a Builder, too, than I have been! Nay there is nothing to hinder you to be luckier; even I already know one far preferable to my last. The marriage once done,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of his sister Rosette; from mid-<date when="1852-10">Oct.</date> Neuberg lived in Willesden House, Willesden.</note> you must break ground at Hampstead; and push the matter vigorously to a good conclusion!&#x2014;</p>
<p>There has nothing happened here, of much moment, since you went away. The Cloaca-Maxima<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ancient Rome&#x2019;s great sewer.</note> confusions disappeared from our street; the Russian or other such Questions did not agitate us much; and the summer weather, almost always <hi rend="italic">grey</hi> enough, warm enough, and windy enough, has been greatly to my mind,&#x2014;never oppressively hot one day, and yet bringing on a good harvest, as I hear it prophesied.&#x2014; I brought out the <hi rend="italic">Nigger Question</hi>, with a good stout mass of new matter, stuck into the middle of it, tempering the wind to the shorn lamb: a small green sixpenny book;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530401-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1853-04-01">1 April</date></ref>.</note> if I knew any way, I would send you a copy;&#x2014;but that will come in good time; and furthermore you will find at one place a thought of your own introduced, to heighten your interest in the piece. <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> also is out:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s shilling essay &#x201C;Samuel Johnson,&#x201C; pbd. by Chapman &#x26; Hall in their &#x201C;Reading for Travellers&#x201C; series.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">hat nichts zu bedeuten</hi></foreign> [it&#x2019;s of no interest]. This is the sum of my literary publishings for the present season;&#x2014;and infinitesimal quantity, and yet, I do believe, perhaps enough!</p>
<p>For the rest the burden of Fritz lies heavy on me; and really is at last becoming <hi rend="italic">unbearable</hi>. Except as driven on by that negative species of impulse, <pb id="pg-28-228" n="28:228"/>the transcendent intolerability of such a lumber-mountain laid upon one&#x2019;s heart, I see no slightest chance of any solution,&#x2014;of a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> solution I reckon the matter incapable here at Chelsea (instead of Berlin) in this year of grace. I wish to Heaven I had never heard of Fritz! He has been the <hi rend="italic">death</hi> of several years of my existence;&#x2014;and he gave us a very bad night at Lowositz,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lobositz; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520817-TC-JN-01"><sic>27:229</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1852-08-17">17 Aug. 1852</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520927-TC-JWC-01"><sic>307</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1852-09-27">27 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> as you recollect, and at some other places! <hi rend="italic">Off</hi> my unfortunate soul, however, he shall go, and <hi rend="italic">must</hi> before long,&#x2014;if down into the belly of Chaos and German Dryasdustism again, how can I help it? Certainly I shall be cunning if, out of that world of sordid cinders, slag and scoriae, accumulated by the Genus Pedant (in the <hi rend="italic">pipeclayed</hi>, in the academic, and other forms) diligently working, with the whole field to itself, for above a hundred years, <hi rend="italic">I</hi>, poor I, can ever smelt the little ingot that lies balefully hidden in them!&#x2014; &#x2014; For some weeks back, I have been forcing myself to <hi rend="italic">actual writing</hi>,&#x2014;yet all along, with the feeling that not a word of it would <hi rend="italic">do;</hi> and that <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> alone could be the destination of all that. Heaven help me&#x2014; But I had better <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> no more of it, at any rate: let it beat me, if it can and must: I am well <hi rend="italic">capable</hi> of being beaten by this time.</p>
<p>But let me take up Weber&#x2019;s case, while there is still paper left. So far as I know, or can learn, Weber has none but himself to blame for not being paid sooner: the instant his Account had appeared in a <hi rend="italic">liquid</hi> shape (as it was expected to do, and even <hi rend="italic">asked</hi> to do), it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been paid by return of post. Impress that on him, for future cases; and in general, that a <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> of &#x201C;correspondence&#x201C; about any matter is desirable in that quarter!&#x2014; Yesterday Lord A.

<p>As to the new order of Prints, two (I think) that were ordered,&#x2014;I can only say, Stand by the order you <hi rend="italic">got;</hi> and don&#x2019;t be afraid of a few shillings if the Print is really good and the copy good. And the <hi rend="italic">swifter</hi>, the better!&#x2014; For the rest, your words, &#x201C;Engraved by Bause after Wille,&#x2014;Freder<hi rend="italic">k</hi> at a Review,&#x201C; must include a <hi rend="italic">mistake</hi> of some kind;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote that &#x201C;of the new prints ordered, the one engraved by Bause after Wille: Frederic at a review &#x2026; cannot be had now under 12 dollars.&#x201C; TC noted on MS: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Frederic&#x2019;s last review</hi> (Painted by one Cunningham in <date when="1785">1785</date>) contains many Portraits of Generals &#x26;c; is of large size and <hi rend="italic">said</hi> to be good;&#x2014;but whether worth 1.10?

N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2 (of the slip in pencil) was the grand desideratum,&#x2014;if that in a good form is to be got for 12 th<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thalers.</note> send it. N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 1 too, if that is the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Fritz by Graff (now in the Banking house at Berlin, which Magnus took me to see),<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521007-TC-LOA-01"><sic>27:325</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1852-10-07">7 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> or much resembles it, that also will be worth sending and paying for. What N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 3 <hi rend="italic">is</hi> (in Preuss) I cannot perfectly make out: but it seems to be a <hi rend="italic">young</hi> F<hi rend="italic">tz</hi> (not so <hi rend="italic">good</hi> as Schmidt&#x2019;s, after the same original Pesne), and is of less value to us here. And this is all the direction I can give in the Weber affair and you and he, I hope, will work your way thro&#x2019; it, in some handsome manner after all. Let me have his <hi rend="italic">receipt</hi> to send to Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, by the next Letter you write: this is the one request ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> which there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> doubt;&#x2014;and after this, we shall see! (N.b. I believe, in private, these <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Ashburton Prints are ordered solely or chiefly for my behoof; so, if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> see them, you will be abler to decide than any other.)</p>
<p>If you go again to Berlin, I shall probably have enough to ask! Here is already one <hi rend="italic">Memorandum:</hi> To copy (out of Porst&#x2019;s Hymn book) that Psalm-song sung at Leuthen Battle: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Gib dass ich thu&#x2019; mit Fleiss</hi>, was &#x26;c&#x201C; Preuss ii.107);<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Grant that I with zeal may do, what &#x26;c;&#x201C; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:312. Presumably Johann Porst, <hi rend="italic">Geistliche und liebliche Lieder</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1794">1794</date>).</note>&#x2014;also another Hymn or Psalm, sung on a (as I find in another Book) on a very diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> sort of occasion, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Greif / an das Werk mit Freuden / Wozu Gott mich bescheiden / in meinem Amt und Stand</hi>&#x201C;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Set joyfully to work in the circumstances and with the capability God has given me&#x201C;; untraced.</note> (if you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> such a Piece or can find it easily, for it is not otherwise of almost the least real importance to me). There will be other work specially for Berlin, if you go.</p>
<p>At Kiel, if you meet with any intelligent reading man, you will be in the right place for informing yourself about <hi rend="italic">Struensee</hi> &#x26; Queen Matilda of Denmark:<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Friedrich von Struensee (<date when="1737">1737</date>&#x2013;<date when="1772">72</date>), German-Danish philosopher, court physician, and minister of state, lover of Queen Caroline Matilda (<date when="1751">1751</date>&#x2013;<date when="1775">75</date>), the wife of King Christian VII of Denmark (<date when="1749">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1808">1808</date>) and sister of Britain&#x2019;s George III. For about 10 months he was all-powerful, then forced out of office by a conspiracy of Danish nobles, condemned, tortured, and beheaded. King Christian&#x2019;s marriage to Matilda was dissolved, <date when="1772">1772</date>. See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19: 167.</note> I believe there is <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Danish History that truly elucidates that matter? The Pamphlet about Struensee&#x2019;s &#x201C;Conversion,&#x201C; while under sentence of death;&#x2014;in fact any <hi rend="italic">real</hi>, illuminative details, on the subject;&#x2014;use any opportunity you may have to procure such, or indications towards such. I read lately an English Book on the subject (Sir R. Murray Keith&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>) but that is <pb id="pg-28-230" n="28:230"/>edited by a fool.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Memoirs and Correspondence (Official and Familiar) of Sir R.

(<date when="1849">1849</date>).

<p>Finally if you chance to be in <hi rend="italic">Antiquar</hi> shops (but don&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">go</hi> thither, no!), and can find the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> volume of that &#x201C;Lebens&#x2014;und Regierungs Geschichte Friedrichs des Andern (Leipzig <date when="1786">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1788">88</date>),&#x201C;<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J.

<p>And so enough, dear Neuberg, for this once. Go to Kissingen, and get fast well again.&#x2014; My Wife has been in Scotland these four weeks, and is now on her return as far as Liverpool,&#x2014;home probably tomorrow.

<p><salute>Alas, alas, dear Goody mine,</salute> I have made a sad useless day of it; and, with much fuss, have got no visible work done; nor is there any hope of you at the end of it. None!

<p>We had a deluge of rain last night; and after some sluggish heat, it has begun sluggishly raining again. I heard nothing of it thro&#x2019; the night, tho&#x2019; Fanny reports that it awoke her (nothing of it had begun at 1 a.m.): indeed the Garden itself bears traces what a pour it was; the little Darling is washed quite flat in consequence.</p>
<p>I have got no farther notice from John: alas, I meant to have <hi rend="italic">written</hi> to my poor Mother today&#x2014;writing is all I can do!&#x2014;but in this also I am foiled.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>I am greatly obliged by these bulletins you send me about my poor dear old Mother; the one I have just got tonight has been a precious relief to me. What is to be the immediate issue, God alone knows: I think of little else, and am in a continual sadness, very deep but not without blessedness either, about it,&#x2014;and try to be resigned and prepared for what can so easily befal. Do not let me want for a word of news!&#x2014; I think in general, this seems to be a <hi rend="italic">crisis</hi> produced by the excessive use of stimulants, wine &#x26;c (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> surely is not a good line of action, if one could help it); and I sometimes incline to hope, since <hi rend="italic">her own strength</hi> brought her out of it, she may yet be spared to us a while. But we do not know, we do not know! God alone is ruler of it; God&#x2019;s will be done, for this world and for all worlds. Amen.</p>
<p>Jane was to have come today according to one plan; but she is still at A. Welsh&#x2019;s (a quieter house than that in Maryland Street); and I do not much think she will be here till monday; nor shall I even know till tomorrow.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friday, <date when="1853-07-29">29 July</date>. See <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530729-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1853-07-29">29 July</date></ref>.</note> She appears to be very sleepless, weakly, tho&#x2019; not specially ailing: I suppose she may be better here than in any other place, now that the Town is thinned.</p>
<p>I had a Letter from Neuberg the other day: dates W&#xfc;rzburg (or near it); has been sadly plagued with all manner of ailments flying over his massy person;&#x2014;is going now to Kissingen to the waters, then to Kiel &#x26; the Baltic Coasts; afterwards to England to <hi rend="italic">settle:</hi> Poor fellow, after all.</p>
<p>Some <hi rend="italic">work</hi> tries to go on here, but the result is very trifling!&#x2014; You will all <pb id="pg-28-233" n="28:233"/>be flying about till <date when="1853-11">November</date> come; and one may have the hope of falling in with you in some part of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> wanderings. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother</salute></closer></p>

<p>Very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wauf</hi></foreign> today, my Dear; having been awakened by my Ronca-friend at 4; and a sad <foreign><hi rend="italic">pluister</hi></foreign> [mess] of a futile morning, followed by a still more futile day, having been my portion!

<p>What you say of John excites painful curiosities in me! I am persuaded, the poor soul could not have <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> anything in the least unkind; but he is capable of terrible <hi rend="italic">blindness</hi> to another&#x2019;s feelings, rights and claims, especially when whirled about by an influx of self-conceit; blind as a mole he can then be. I am anxiously waiting your report on that head too; and not without apprehension, from the turn of your hints. Poor soul, I shall be right sorry to find him &#x201C;in a bad way,&#x201C;&#x2014;tho such may be the case, in some measure, from guessable causes.</p>
<p>If I am not better than <hi rend="italic">today</hi>, Addiscombe will answer badly for me! On <pb id="pg-28-234" n="28:234"/>the whole, I wish much you had come,&#x2014;for that and other reasons. I need not have <hi rend="italic">ascribed</hi> anything to you; I could merely have said, You were come, and how could I leave you? However, that is fixed now; and I suppose I shall go on Sunday or tomorrow evening:&#x2014;I shall at any rate have no Ronca-cock there! (Nor here either, for that matter, after Fanny&#x2019;s message solemnly delivered this night! Let me be just!)</p>
<p>Lady A. I doubt not <hi rend="italic">got</hi> your Letter &#x26; Gift whatever it was; these things are never <hi rend="italic">lost:</hi> but she should have said so, by all rules. Nay I half remember some indication of the Letter at least: every time I have seen her since you went, the first question always is about you,&#x2014;and one day, about the time in question, I have a remembrance of her having anticipated me in that topic of discourse, and <hi rend="italic">said</hi> something that indicated news direct from you. I will ask farther at Addiscombe.</p>

<p><salute>My good and dear old Mother,&#x2014;</salute>How many things I would like to say to you, if I had words to put them in! I fear you are very weak indeed, and have had a bad time since I last wrote directly to you. But, alas, I myself am not well today (having been awakened too soon); and if there were no other hindrance, I am, as usual, very short of time even. I will say <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, but write you a word of mere news (or rather <hi rend="italic">no-news</hi>, for there is nothing passing here at all); and leave all the rest in silence. You are never out of my thoughts; and about my feelings &#x26;c towards you, you have no need that I should write.</p>
<p>I expected to have got Jane back yesterday (Thursday); but she did not come; they persuaded her to stay a few days with them at Liverpool; and this morning her Note to me settles that she is to come <hi rend="italic">on Monday</hi>. Not till Monday afternoon shall I get her installed into her old place again, and be myself quit of housekeeping; which is a business I do not shine in, and do not like at all! On first arriving at Liverpool, Jane seems to have been but poorly, sleepless &#x26;c; but she is doing well enough now; and says, her Tour has &#x201C;at least done her no mischief.&#x201C; She will feel the full benefit of it when once she <pb id="pg-28-235" n="28:235"/>is got settled at home again. She seemed greatly satisfied to have been at Scotsbrig; and wrote many beautiful and affectionate and affecting details about my good Mother while there. She did not deny how weak you were, nor hide the trouble you had been in: but she speaks confidently about a marked improvement being probable (and she has a considerable <hi rend="italic">medical</hi> insight really; better than that of many Doctors by profession): and the other beautiful things she reported brought my good old Mother so vividly before me, and were a comfort in all one&#x2019;s troubles! Her account of the kindness of Jamie and Isabella is enthusiastic! I am greatly indebted to you all.</p>
<p>Since Jane left me solitary I have <supplied>[been]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> tugging a little harder at the harness, and <hi rend="italic">endeavouring</hi> a little to get my work forward. Alas, it is mostly an endeavour only. I have nothing that is of the least comfort to me except the thought of getting some useful work done while I continue here below: but there are many obstacles, continual interruptions, distraction; and alas, tho&#x2019; the spirit may be willing, the <hi rend="italic">flesh</hi> is not very strong just now.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 26:41.</note> I do not like my job either; but how can I help that? I will not let it quite <hi rend="italic">beat</hi> me, after all,&#x2014;not willing to do that, however bad a job!</p>
<p>We have had much wet weather; indeed it has altogether been a grey damp summer here, always brisk wind, the sun oftenest <hi rend="italic">veiled</hi>, a fine temperature, but never for one whole day any oppression from heat. The very kind of summer that I like. It seems as if I might have got some <hi rend="italic">work done</hi> in it; but I have not!&#x2014; The harvest they say,&#x2014;except the hay which got much rain,&#x2014;is said to promise very fairly all over the country. The people <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be well if they liked, for they are getting plenty of wages; but it is sad enough to see what <hi rend="italic">use</hi> many of them make of all that; a generation not of <hi rend="italic">wise</hi>, but, in plentiful instances, of <hi rend="italic">fools</hi>.&#x2014; The Town is getting <hi rend="italic">emptied</hi> of all its quality now; which will render it a great deal quieter (especially at this end of it) for those that want to employ their time in <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> something reasonable.</p>
<p>Jean I find is still with you,&#x2014;perhaps it is she that will read this letter? If so let her accept my affectionate regards as ever;&#x2014;furthermore, she may take some moment, and <hi rend="italic">write</hi> me a word; which would be kind of her. John has sent me two Notes since Jane left; the last came yesternight, and gave a good account,&#x2014;I need not say how welcome to me! He is not to write again till he have seen you on Monday: he will then have no <hi rend="italic">House</hi> at Moffat; his Wife <hi rend="italic">to Edinburgh</hi> (he tells me), and he himself ready to go when wanted, or at least <hi rend="italic">readier</hi>.&#x2014; I got the enclosed Note from Jamie (of Glasgow) the other day;&#x2014;and find I have not yet acknowledged it as I meant! <closer><salute>God&#x2019;s blessing be on you, dear Mother, now and ever!&#x2014; Yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to hear, by your Note, that you have got a commercial situation which you like, and which may really be reckoned preferable to the Railway one. In the hurry and alarm there has been at Scotsbrig lately about my Mother, nobody had mentioned this change of yours. Indeed it was not the Doctor that was writing to me, but my own Mrs., who does not know you so well as he.</p>
<p>The way to <hi rend="italic">succeed</hi> in your new place will be the same as in the old one, and is indeed the way in all situations whatsoever: To <hi rend="italic">stand to it</hi> honestly, and in a conscientious, modest, diligent man<supplied>[ner,]</supplied> do your very best at all times! This, I have no doubt, is your purpose; and you must never slacken till you have confirmed it into <hi rend="italic">steady habit</hi>. The longer you go on well, it becomes the <hi rend="italic">easier</hi> to do it; habit being a &#x201C;second nature.&#x201C; You will learn all parts of your task, book-keeping &#x26;c &#x26;c without difficulty, if you strenuously and constantly endeavour. This will be a great happiness to all that take interest in you; and it is the confident hope of us all.</p>
<p>You do not mention what part of the Town your Office is in, still less what <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of trade it is the Messrs Stevenson follow:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly William Stevenson &#x26; Sons, cotton spinners, South Exchange Court, 77 Queen St.</note> say a word or two about all this when you write again.</p>
<p>Your Chelsea Aunt is not come home yet, does not come till Monday. The news last night from Scotsbrig was good.&#x2014;<closer><salute>I remain always,</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>Yours affect<hi rend="italic">ly</hi> /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Across the top of the MS, presumably on forwarding the letter to his parents, James wrote: &#x201C;The reason why I was so inexplicit was that I thought it would only be telling him what he already knew for I fancied the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. would have mentioned it to him before but it seems from this there had not been any letters passing between them. I will again write &#x26; tell him all about it.&#x201C;</note></p>

<p>Last night, after 3 days silence, I went to Chorley for a little touch of human or semi-human speech again,&#x2014;in the course of which I learned this strange fact (testified on the streets had I been heedful before), That there is <pb id="pg-28-237" n="28:237"/>not <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi> a Cab to be got at any railway here; that nearly all the Cabmen, since Wednesday last, are <hi rend="italic">on strike</hi>, negociating with Fitzroy and his new Bill,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Fitzroy (<date when="1807">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">59</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9637"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), M.P. for Lewes, <date when="1837">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">59</date>; under-sec. for Home Dept., <date when="1852">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855">55</date>, and largely responsible for passing the Hackney Carriages (Metropolis) Act, <date when="1853">1853</date>.</note> who won&#x2019;t give in! A new company, it seems, is about coming in, &#x26;c; the railway people, meanwhile, are doing their very best, with <hi rend="italic">luggage</hi> carts, omnibuses &#x26;c; but cannot with assurance promise any lady (much less any gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>) a Cab at their stations! That is the fact; or was, last night; and is like to be on Monday.&#x2014;&#x2014; You <hi rend="italic">must</hi> therefore appoint your train; and write about it directly; and let me be on the ground for you, on Monday with a Neat Fly. Otherwise you will be driven upon the Chelsea-Islington Omnibus; have to wait some minutes on the street, and be set down at Sloane Square:&#x2014;which is not a handsome conveyance for a Goody coming home, &#x201C;on half-pay after the 7-years war!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; Name the hour, therefore; and keep it;&#x2014;and look well out for the brown wide-awake, as it will for you. I shall be home time enough from Addiscombe,&#x2014;before 1 o&#x2019;clock surely; and <hi rend="italic">long</hi> before 4 or 5, I can have my neat fly and self in waiting at Euston Square Let me find a Letter, and do you stand to it: that is all.</p>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">got</hi> six good hours of sleep; awoke at 7 however, and could make nothing more of it tho&#x2019; I tried;&#x2014;I am much better today. Had there not been utter silence I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have slept at all; for I had withal taken <hi rend="italic">coffee</hi> instead of evening tea, felt <hi rend="italic">drunk</hi> with it on getting to bed 5 hours after; and was like to leap out of my skin, had I been disturbed. But I was not: Ronca, the Demon-God on such occasions, was propitious; and I heard absolutely <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>,&#x2014;except, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> half past eight, his own heavy cough, as he first steps out; poor Devil, a bad cough indeed, as I said to myself; and I am to be annoyed at the mere <hi rend="italic">noise</hi> of it! Selfish mortal indeed!&#x2014; The morning was showery; and I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of excusing myself till tomorrow. But now I shall go, all having grown so bright; and no <hi rend="italic">scrag</hi> being here, still less any gooseberries &#x26;c. <closer><salute>God bless thee!</salute></closer></p>

<p>I was sure of it! that you knew nothing about the cab-strike when you wrote on Thursday! <hi rend="italic">Here</hi>, it has been the main topic of conversation&#x2014;since <pb id="pg-28-238" n="28:238"/>Wednesday; news about it coming daily by electric telegraph&#x2014;&#x201C;There is great social freedom in <hi rend="italic">Chelsea</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014; I intended writing today whether I got another letter or no&#x2014;to tell, under these rather exquisite circumstances the train I should arrive by&#x2014;that I might not be thrown out with my trunks &#x201C;sang froid to Charity&#x201C;&#x2014; The Times of Friday gave it as <hi rend="italic">its</hi> belief that the whole thing would terminate yesterday; but the Times not being infallible, it would be safest I thought, that your eyes should be opened to the great fact you were unconsciously living in&#x2014;and precautions taken against all contingencies&#x2014; If you find tomorrow that the Cabs are at work again you need not mind bringing a Fly&#x2014;if the strike continue the Fly will be very welcome&#x2014;at the same time it is possible that Fly-keepers may be making hay while the Sun shines and exacting an extortionful price for their Flies&#x2014; In that case just come yourself and help me with the luggage (I don&#x2019;t mean in <hi rend="italic">carrying</hi> it) and I can <hi rend="italic">walk</hi>. But I hope the cabs will be all a-going again&#x2014; In any case I shall lookout for the brown wide a wake and remain by my baggage till it come to the rescue. I have been this morning to James Martineaus Church<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Hope St.</note>&#x2014;close by here&#x2014;and heard <hi rend="italic">not</hi> James Martineau but a perfect blockhead<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> whom I could hardly help ordering to sit down and hold his peace.&#x2014; all about &#x201C;virtue&#x201C; being its &#x201C;own reward&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;with the same relish!&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310815-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:331</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-15">15 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;&#x201C;not only God&#x201C; he said but (what he seemed to consider infinitely more important) &#x201C;all people were merciful towards the merciful man.&#x201C; As if it were not plain to me and to everybody of common sense that <hi rend="italic">the merciful men</hi> gets himself made into mince-meat by &#x201C;all people&#x201C;&#x2014;and serve him right, for being such a spooney as to expect any good to himself or &#x201C;others&#x201C; out of following the profession of <hi rend="italic">mercy</hi> at this time of day!</p>
<p>There never was such a stock of pens as this house presents unless at Chatham Street&#x2014;</p>
<p>Mercy! I had as near as possible forgotten the one thing that needed to be said&#x2014;</p>
<p>I intend to leave by the eleven o&#x2019;clock train which reaches Euston Square at 7 of the evening Nero bids me say not to feel hurt should he shew little joy at seeing you, as his digestion is all deranged since he has been here with the constant crumbs of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">suet plums</hi>&#x201C; that fall to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> share&#x2014; When I came in from Church today, tho&#x2019; it had been the first hour he had been separated from me since we left home together, he could hardly raise a jump</p>

<p><salute>Dear Redwood,&#x2014;</salute>I got your Letter this morning; and was very glad to hear of you at first hand again; and very much obliged indeed by your ever-kind purposes towards me. Alas, there is no Wales, no rural fields at all, for me this year! I got so thoroughly smashed to pieces last season by my roamings up and down the world,&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> operation, as I often said to myself, for there is never-failing <hi rend="italic">misery</hi>, want of sleep &#x26;c &#x26;c, purchased by great effort and expense, in such things,&#x2014;that I privately resolved to stay close at home on the present occasion; and do the best I could <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, for at least one year. My Wife has been in Scotland; returned four days ago; we are now to <hi rend="italic">stay</hi> in the silent Town; which really, when once the Quality are all out of it, becomes a very eligible place for carrying on study in. So stands it.&#x2014; I am not sure, farther, but I shall still have to build one other apartment in this place,&#x2014;a top-story extending over the whole house, with double walls (of a sort), lighted from above, and with internal means of ventilation: so that we may be <hi rend="italic">deaf</hi> to all conceivable street noises; and may at least have the privilege of sleeping, and of reading, thinking, living, in an absolute <hi rend="italic">divine silence</hi> henceforth! I have a plan for such a thing; and certainly it would be a glorious conquest to me.</p>
<p>My poor Enterprise on <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi> II is the most <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> of all I have ever buckled with in this world; and cannot and will not come to the least success with me. I have given up all thoughts of &#x201C;succeeding&#x201C;; my one trembling hope is that of, some day, <hi rend="italic">finishing</hi>,&#x2014;getting my soul deliv<supplied>[ered]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Omitted by TC.</note> of it, tho&#x2019; with disgrace.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your last Note, for which many thanks, seemed to give a somewhat more promising account of our dear Mother&#x2019;s situation; and has been a comfort to one&#x2019;s vague imaginations ever since. But, of course, the fact fluctuates from day to day; and we cannot hide from ourselves that she is frail and weak to an extreme degree. The <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>continuance, and if possible, total abrogation of those <hi rend="italic">stimulant</hi> methods, is surely a wise course; and gives what strength there <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, fair play. <hi rend="italic">More</hi> strength no medical means can create; it is running into a series of <hi rend="italic">debts</hi>, strict account of which is kept, and payment demanded with compound interest. Jane thinks favourably of the matter (as I perceive), if this condition be adhered to.&#x2014; My poor dear Mother, I wish I had something to send to her today! But there is nothing, nothing than<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;that.&#x201C;</note> can be of the least use. A poor Magazine, and <hi rend="italic">Tract</hi> (of Chambers&#x2019;s, on myself)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Writings of Thomas Carlyle,&#x201C; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530722-TC-RC-01">TC to RC, <date when="1853-07-22">22 July</date></ref>.</note> out of which some of you might have read to her for a few minutes: this I did mean to send; but even this I cannot get just at the fit moment; and so must put it off till monday. I am not rich in gifts just now,&#x2014;and in that best direction, am utterly poor!</p>
<p>Jane arrived safe on Monday Evening; found me at the station, and <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> enough. Nero was stupefied nearly to death in the basket he had been nestled in; and seemed indifferent even when he did recognise that he had got home: the foolish little quadruped, he really is not a <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> production of Nature. Poor Jane had to go next day, and even the next again, to the Dentist; parted with <hi rend="italic">three</hi> teeth; and did at length get to some sleep, which has much set her up again. She has greatly enlightened this household establish<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for me, by her return to it. I do not shine in housekeeping in these hot days.</p>
<p>London is getting beautifully empty: the intolerable noises, the Cremorne Cabs and rockets, very many confusing annoyances, will disappear or diminish; and perhaps we shall now get a better chance at useful exertion of some kind! I do not know but I shall have to build an <hi rend="italic">Upper Story</hi> yet (<hi rend="italic">soundless</hi> apart<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, lighted from the top) after all: I have a plan for such; but am very <foreign><hi rend="italic">swear, swear!</hi></foreign>&#x2014; The Ashburtons go for the extreme North, <hi rend="italic">Thurso</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town in Caithness, on N coast of Scotland.</note> nearly, on Monday; they have left us liberty of their beautiful little place at Addiscombe in the interim,&#x2014;really one of the prettiest green places in the <pb id="pg-28-242" n="28:242"/>world;&#x2014;but I know not whether we shall get much use of it either: even with no use at all, it is a pleasant thought in hot days.</p>
<p>I have got no <hi rend="italic">real</hi> breaking of the ground effected yet, in my poor barren job; but am scraping about in a very unpleasant manner, obstacles enough, from myself and from the world, to bar progress if <hi rend="italic">they</hi> can. Let us hope they cannot quite!&#x2014; <closer><salute>My kind thanks and regards to Jamie and Isabella, and to all of you for your help to poor Jane, who is very sensible to any sort of help or kindness. My heart&#x2019;s blessings on my poor Mother,&#x2014;of whom let me hear soon. Yours affectionately ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>Will you kindly write me a few lines to tell me how it is going on with you all&#x2014; I heard in Liverpool on my way home, thro the young man who had been with D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell that he was doing very well&#x2014;out of all danger, and on my return I was most happy to see his own handwriting on the newspaper, tho&#x2019; still not so steady yet as it used to be&#x2014; But M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Aitken<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Carlyle Aitken.</note> thro&#x2019; whom I sometimes hear of you having been absent from Dumfries almost constantly since I left&#x2014;attending her Mother at Scotsbrig I have no news of D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell from her further and am anxious to know if he be going about again as usual&#x2014;</p>
<p>What a sad piece of work my visit to Scotland was!&#x2014; The week at Scotsbrig, where M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle might have died any moment without any of us being surprised, took all heart out of me for further visiting and I returned to Liverpool in less than three weeks after I had quitted it in the intention to stay away at least two months&#x2014;On the way to the Ecclefechan station with my Brotherinlaw I received a letter from Helen Welsh which I knew was to <pb id="pg-28-243" n="28:243"/>say she was in daily expectation of me at Auchtertool&#x2014; I put it in my pocket and did not open it till I was at Carlisle&#x2014;in case it had over-persuaded me to go north instead of South where by that time I was looked for&#x2014; In such a helpless uncertain state of mind did I feel myself!&#x2014; At Liverpool however I stayed a week&#x2014;and would been very well off <hi rend="italic">there</hi> but for horrible toothach which had tormented me off and on from the time I left London&#x2014; The night I came home I did not sleep one wink with it&#x2014; So in the morning before M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C was up I went off alone to a Dentist and had <hi rend="italic">two</hi> teeth drawn&#x2014;and in the evening it was found one of them had been a <hi rend="italic">mistake</hi>&#x2014;my toothach raging on one side exactly as before so next morning I went again and had a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> drawn all that pain brought on a bilious fit which has made me good for nothing ever since&#x2014; I entrusted M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Aitken with a woolen article for old Mary<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mills.</note>&#x2014;which I hope was duly forwarded to you How unlucky that I did not see you dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell when I had actually made up my mind to go <hi rend="italic">there!</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Templand.</note>&#x2014; <closer><salute>All good be with you your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came the day before yesterday; and I need not say how welcome it was. Your news of our dear old Mother,&#x2014;nothing in this world could be so welcome as good news from that quarter, which yours were in some degree! Thanks for them. My heart and imagination are filled with that matter; and all manner of sad things, so sad, yet so tender, pious and blessed tho&#x2019; sad,&#x2014;lie always in the background of whatever I think or do.</p>
<p>I am not without hopes our good old woman is now gathering a little strength, and may have a more tolerable time of it. Alas, if I could but <hi rend="italic">do</hi> anything whatever for her, it would be some comfort; but I can do nothing, and all remains a fruitless wish with me. Jane spoke something about a <hi rend="italic">Bath Chair</hi> she had been proposing,&#x2014;it is a nice little spring <hi rend="italic">chaise</hi> with a hood over it, runs softly on four wheels; a weak person can sit there, and be easily drawn about in the open air. I think often, my Mother might get some good of it; and make little voyages to the Fairy Brae, round the Garden, or wherever she liked upon <hi rend="italic">roads</hi> (if you flung the loose stones off them first): no doubt, your James could get it easily for us at Dumfries, or John is in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> even now:&#x2014;I wish you would propose it again; and, above all, would <hi rend="italic">consider</hi> the business yourself, and see whether there is not feasibility in it. One thing I do know: If my poor Mother would take it and try it, I should consider the price of it the <hi rend="italic">best spent</hi> money I have laid out for 7 years past! Indeed I know not where or how I could spend money, ever in my life again, more to my advantage.&#x2014; Consider this business, try it well; and tell me whether there can nothing be done in it. Or if my Mother w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have a Chair <hi rend="italic">bought</hi> all at once, we could easily <hi rend="italic">hire</hi> one, and let her make a trial of it? I am persuaded there is no safety for her but in <hi rend="italic">avoiding</hi> those &#x201C;stimulants,&#x201C; and momentary helps, and trusting to the general influences of regimen and air, so far as possible. A little <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> every bright day, when she was able to be up, could not fail to do good.</p>
<p>I am myself fully better since Jane came home: she keeps the house more <pb id="pg-28-245" n="28:245"/>snug about me;&#x2014;she, furthermore, recommended <hi rend="italic">tincture of rhubarb</hi> to me; which really has done me an immense good for the last ten days! I have only taken six teaspoonfuls yet (on occasional mornings), and the effect (which, alas, I know will be <hi rend="italic">temporary</hi>) is hitherto better than that of any drug I can remember in that sad quarter of my experience.</p>
<p>All summer I have been more or less annoyed with <hi rend="italic">noises</hi>, even accidental ones, which get free access thro&#x2019; my open windows: all the tinkering and &#x201C;repairing&#x201C; has done me no good in that respect. A very despicable, very intolerable sort of sufferings,&#x2014;as poor Aird and others, can testify! At length, after deep deliberation, I have fairly decided to have a top story put upon the House, one big apart<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 20 feet square, with thin <hi rend="italic">double</hi> walls, light from the top &#x26;c, and artfully ventilated,&#x2014;into which no sound <hi rend="italic">can</hi> come; and all the cocks in Nature may crow round it, without my hearing a whisper of them! My notion is, it really will answer. John Chorley, a practical Liverpool <hi rend="italic">railway</hi> man who is very loyal to me, went to Cubitts the Chief Builders here, told them my sad case, &#x201C;a Literary man&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c; and they agreed to send a <hi rend="italic">right man</hi>, with estimates, with &#x26;c &#x26;c: and here accordingly he is this very day mounting his scaffolds and ladders from the street,&#x2014;to work <hi rend="italic">altogether from the outside;</hi> and to have done &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">within</hi> six weeks&#x201C;! I did not think of building again so soon: but Jane too encouraged and urged me; and indeed I have a feeling that this may prove one of the usefullest things I ever built. Our next neighbour&#x2019;s poultry (and even his poor <hi rend="italic">self</hi>, a coarse and poor but not a <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> one), I perceive, will before long be got quite rid of: but henceforth I hope to be independent of all men and all dogs, cocks and household or street noises,&#x2014;which are waxing every year in this Chelsea with the furious building &#x26;c that now goes on in the once quiet suburb!&#x2014; As everything is rigorously <hi rend="italic">estimated</hi>, and Chorley is to be Clerk of the works, I design not to interfere in the business at all; but sit at my work within doors. If it grow too bad, we can run to Addiscombe, only 10 miles off, and beautiful enough for the Queen &#x26; Albert (or a still better pair): and the very thought of that renders one more patient from day to day.</p>
<p>My poor Book makes no progress; but it shall make, if I live! It keeps me very unhappy; and is in fact an unmanageable kind of business; wanting more <hi rend="italic">rage</hi> and energy than I have yet bestowed on it</p>
<p>Of course you are needed at Dumfries; but I hope you will not go just yet, as my Mother likes to have you.&#x2014;&#x2014; If you have nothing to read, tell me, and I will send some Book.&#x2014; Jack has written twice; enclosing your last Letter to him. <closer><salute>Give my regards to Jamie &#x26; Isabella. Jane is gone out, or she would send her grateful remembrances to you all. My poor Mother&#x2019;s pot of marmalade; blessings on her for it!&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Sister: send another word soon. Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Sir</hi>,</salute>
<p>Yesterday, in your absence, I left a paper,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either a copy of Bacon&#x2019;s first paper or the longer version about which she wrote to Emerson, <date when="1853-11-12">12 Nov.</date>, from New Brompton: &#x201C;I determined not to go anywhere or open my lips on the subject again till I had prepared a written statement which would enable me to do some credit to your introductions.&#x201C; She intended making &#x201C;such alterations and corrections as I found necessary for my purpose. But the first page grew into forty &#x2026; I found as you predicted that I could write better here than at home. &#x2026; As soon as it was finished I sent it to Carlyle. If I could have anticipated it would be out of my hands so long I would not have let it go without taking a perfect copy of it to send to you. &#x2026; Carlyle came all the way from Chelsea &#x2026; to see me as soon as he read my paper. He talked to me very kindly about it. As to my conclusion of course he did not believe a word of it, but he said the paper was &#x2018;very eloquent&#x2019; and he said more than that but it would be absurd in me to repeat it&#x201C; (MS: Massachusetts Hist. Soc.).</note> on which your candid judgment, as to its fitness for <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> especially, is much wanted.</p>
<p>The writer, a person of considerable talent, of perfect respectability and mature years, has formed by some means or other an altogether new, and to us most surprising conviction about the real <hi rend="italic">authorship</hi> of the Plays we call &#x201C;Shakespeare&#x2019;s;&#x201C; and is determined at all hazards, and against all difficulties, to promulgate and make good the same: this is the first sally made, in that big battle; and you now are to tell us freely what you think of it,&#x2014;above all, whether <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> will have it or not.</p>
<p>I myself have no interest in the matter; do not, with the least completeness, understand the author&#x2019;s theory about Shakespeare, or even believe what I do understand of it,&#x2014;or in the least need <hi rend="italic">any</hi> new theory on the subject;&#x2014;but I have read part of the paper, know the author; and for many reasons, am bound to put the thing before you, and certify as above.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bacon&#x2019;s dislike of dealing with the actual historical element in her theory ran counter to everything in which TC believed, so that his readiness to help her is all the more remarkable.</note></p>
<p>It seems ingenious eloquent writing, of its kind; perhaps, under some head or other, it may prove admissible; perhaps not. In the former case, of course the author would show face, and consult, &#x26;c.; in the latter, we are obliged to be altogether <hi rend="italic">anonymous</hi>.</p>
<p>Without hurrying yourself, yet so soon as convenient.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours always truly,</salute></closer>

<salute>My dearest Kate</salute>
<p>I have been living from day to day in a sort of &#x201C;devout imagination&#x201C; that you would come skipping in, and almost stifle me with kisses! but anything so extremely pleasant couldnt, I might have felt sure, come my way just at present when decidedly the tide in my affairs is flowing <hi rend="italic">out not in</hi>&#x2014; I have a whole novel in three volumes of disasters to tell you when we meet, ending (not the meeting but the novel) in a great crash amongst&#x2014;not the ten commandments&#x2014;but my&#x2014;&#x201C;what shall I say?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">teeth!</hi> I have been in Scotland&#x2014;and all went wrong with me there and I came home &#x201C;quite promiscuously&#x201C; two months sooner than I meant <hi rend="small-caps">to</hi>. Your first letter reached me in Liverpool as I went, and the second again in Liverpool as I returned&#x2014;thank you Darling for both&#x2014;better or welcomer letters couldnt be&#x2014;from one woman to another&#x2014;but I dont feel as if I could answer such nice long letters in writing&#x2014;you must <hi rend="italic">come and take</hi> the answers &#x201C;face to face and soul to soul&#x201C;&#x2014;(god bless us how poetical!)&#x2014;</p>
<p>It would have been a greater surprise to me than it was when his Captainship<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Sterling.</note> walked in one morning looking as black as thunder and ten sweeps into the bargain had not Miss Farrer told me the day before of his return and of the poor wifes new confinement&#x2014; He was decidedly not improved in the temper by his long voyage&#x2014;and would tell me absolutely nothing about anything; but that he left you all in the yacht and <hi rend="italic">supposed</hi> you were at Cowes,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isle of Wight.</note> After that I looked for you every day&#x2014;nor do I know yet that you are at Headly&#x2014; The Cap<hi rend="italic">t</hi> offered to take M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to the naval review but M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is no man for that sort of thing and refused the good the Gods had provided him thro the Captain Whereupon he il Capitano flashed off and I have seen or heard no more of him&#x2014;now pray come up&#x2014;I have a bed now to offer you&#x2014;altho the work people are all on the roof building &#x201C;a silent apartment&#x201C; after all!!&#x2014; They go up the outside of the house by ladders thank God&#x2014;and wont come in, they promise, till the new stairs have to be made&#x2014; We have a new Architect this time and things go on like fire&#x2014;&#x2014; If this house become uninhabitable again by and by&#x2014;there is Addiscombe standing empty with one Maid in it&#x2014;which Lady A with her usual practical kindness puts at our service&#x2014; Meanwhile till I have bought myself a goose quill pen or two I can <pb id="pg-28-249" n="28:249"/>write with no expansion&#x2014;for steel pens are and ever will be perfectly unmanagable to my fingers so the only chance you have to get at my history since we parted is to put yourself in the train and come here&#x2014; Tell me what day you will come&#x2014;and if you can sleep two in a bed Julia will perhaps come too&#x2014;Lotta the Cap<hi rend="italic">t</hi> said was still lame with her ancle&#x2014;so unless she would come to see a surgeon it might be pleasanter for her to come when she can walk&#x2014;decidedly if the ancle is not mending fast she ought to show it to somebody&#x2014;Settle it as you like&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I suppose you back at Dumfries again; I have heard no farther word from Scotsbrig since you wrote to me; nor am I quite sure of getting any, except round by John and Edinburgh. A little Note from you, with or without any definite tidings in it, but <hi rend="italic">with</hi> your own ideas there, will be very welcome to me, the oftener the better.</p>
<p>I am much bothered here at present, very low in heart,&#x2014;my work not able to get on at all; which nevertheless is my one defence ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a whole world of paltry annoyances and impediments (sorrow on them! says the lone man, trying <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be quite beaten by them):&#x2014;and at present I am as short of <hi rend="italic">time</hi> even as is usual, or as need be: wherefore I will at once address myself to a small bit of business; a small commission namely, which you are to get James to do for me.</p>
<p>A certain John Chorley (once a gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of mark in the Railway world and elsewhere; at present, a retired philosopher, tho&#x2019; still young; really a clever, learned man, and very fond of <hi rend="italic">me</hi>) is the only person now known to me in the world who fairly possesses the faculty of <hi rend="italic">mending a pen</hi>. He has other, many other, fine and useful faculties, and with these too serves us here; but in a particular manner with <hi rend="italic">penmaking</hi> and what belongs to that.&#x2014; Well, this excellent Chorley complains that, in the whole Earth, for a long time back, he has not been able to find what he accounts a really <hi rend="italic">good</hi> penknife,&#x2014;but finds <hi rend="italic">all</hi> blades (even Rogers&#x2019;s of Sheffield<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Joseph Rodgers &#x26; Sons, cutlers to the Queen, 6 Norfolk St., Sheffield, and 4 Cullvin St., London.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c) to be made of poor ill-tempered steel. I lately gave him my penknife to sharpen: he made both blades keen and fine as a razor;&#x2014;observed withal that he had not seen such a bit of honest steel as was in that knife for ten years back, and could not get such a piece for love or money. That penknife was got new-bladed by your James at Cutler Hinchcliff&#x2019;s;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Joseph Hinchliffe, cutler, 126 High St., Dumfries.</note> it was H<hi rend="italic">ff</hi> who put that preeminent bit of steel where it now is! In consequence, I have come to the plain resolution (and stated it to Chorley) of getting him a penknife from the same place,&#x2014;the very <hi rend="italic">best</hi> H<hi rend="italic">f</hi> can be persuaded to make. That is all: but really that is something considerable; for Chorley has obliged me hundreds of times, and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> run for me by night or by day (tho&#x2019; a hard and angry man otherwise); so that it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give me real pleasure to make him this little Gift in a complete and triumphant form. Here are the essential particulars of the thing:</p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-251" n="28:251"/>Double-bladed knife,&#x2014;one blade a &#x201C;cut-stick,&#x201C; the other for pens (or there may be <hi rend="italic">two</hi> for pens, if you like, but one will do), and sharp-point shape is preferred for this). Buckhorn handle. <hi rend="italic">These</hi> however are all perfectly unimportant particulars in comparison: the partic<hi rend="italic">r</hi> of particulars is, That the steel be as good as mine is! This will cause the grim heart of Chorley to rejoice when he sees it; and he is a judge. I earnestly entreat James and the excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Hinch<hi rend="italic">ff</hi> to do their very best towards attaining me this small but useful blessing. And there shall be cheerful pay<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, not of money only, but of gratitude, as reason good. Perhaps Mr H<hi rend="italic">f</hi> does not make knives at all? In that case, he must knock the blades out of some useful buckhorn handle, and put in right ones of his own, right ones, right ones! And this <hi rend="italic">is</hi> all.</p>
<p>We have again a host of masons &#x26;c (but this time, expert fellows and under real command), building us a big room which shall be airy, and yet utterly <hi rend="italic">deaf</hi>, inaccessible to sound&#x2014;it is to occupy all the available part of a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> uppermost story (old roof to come off &#x26;c &#x26;c): 20 feet square, and light from the top, to be the result:&#x2014;Oh Heaven, I could not help it, I was driven to it, and hope <hi rend="italic">it</hi> will answer. If it do not&#x2014;!&#x2014; Well, I can fly to the moors at any rate; and will. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Sister. We hope better things, tho&#x2019; we thus speak.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got both your Notes, and a Letter of fully later date from Jean,&#x2014;yet not <hi rend="italic">much</hi> later by any means, so that I am again in straits for intelligence. Alas, alas&#x2014;what intelligence (my diseased imagination asks) can I hope!</p>
<p>Here there has nothing essential gone wrong; nothing at all properly, but failure now &#x26; then of sleep, &#x26; multiplex negociations, enterprises &#x26;c of a small nature in consequence. I am truly a <hi rend="italic">biliary</hi> man just now; and often feel as if I had got about my <hi rend="italic">weight</hi>, of disgusting nothingnesses and of graver cares &#x26; sorrows, laid upon my poor shoulders just now. The worst is I cannot get forward with my <hi rend="italic">work;</hi> that properly indeed is my one sorrow; for it cuts off my one stronghold in this sad controversy of a life led as &#x201C;a minority of one,&#x201C;&#x2014;which is rather a tight business at best, and tries the nerves of a man now and then!&#x2014; However, we are actually at work, building an impregnably <hi rend="italic">deaf</hi> apar<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, by way of new top-story; and if (in &#x201C;six weeks time, &#x201C; that is the predicted limit) I can say <hi rend="italic">Eureka</hi> and be out of the mortar-tub, it will be a real conquest. Chorley is &#x26; has been abundantly helpful; all are ready to &#x201C;help&#x201C; if they could. We have a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Builder (a Cubitt&#x2019;s man), and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> goes on like an <pb id="pg-28-252" n="28:252"/>artist, I must say.&#x2014; &#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">scribble</hi> daily in a kind of despair; but it is to almost no purpose, or to absolutely none.</p>
<p>I think I had surely something else to say; but it has gone irrecoverably out of my head; and the Post, and the general tide of things, will not wait. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>. Be all good with you in your touring &#x26; other operations. Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter of this morning brings sad news to me;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Childs wrote, <date when="1853-08-15">15 Aug.</date>, to tell of &#x201C;the death of my excellent father,&#x201C; <date when="1853-08-12">12 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;The last two days of his life were a summary of his whole course of action&#x2014;the deepest humility before God, and genuine dignity before men. &#x2026; [H]e <hi rend="italic">would not</hi> die until he had seen a friend who was long in coming, and to whom he would deliver his solemn protest against &#x2018;the religious formalisms and theologies by which thousands of souls are continually destroyed.&#x2019; My brother, the Surgeon, said it was impossible to retain life until the friend should come, and he seemed to have sunk into the last stupor&#x2014;but when the step was heard, he roused himself, delivered his word slowly, syllabically, with the solemnity of an old-world prophet, and then &#x2026; died instantly.&#x201C;</note> the saddest I have had for many a day; and falls sharp and peculiar, at a time when many things seem conspiring to make me sad! I have lost a true and valued friend, one of the few that were still left to me; and as brave a man as was to be found in this world lives and works in it no more. Alas, alas, I had always thoughts of coming to see him, and this very season, in spite of possibilities, I was solacing myself ever and anon with a dream of that kind; and now, under this sun I shall forever seek him in vain, and we can meet no more here.</p>
<p>Well, well; he lived like a valiant, clear and steadfast man, in the perverse and foolish generation, and was a shining example and rebuke to it in many things; and has victoriously done a great mass of manful work in his time; and may be named one of those few whom the world cannot conquer, but who conquer the world. Honour to him. His death also, was it not beautiful,&#x2014; merciful? We will not sorrow weakly for such a man: he has gone honourably, having honourably finished the work that was given him to do. We will piously remember him and his manful demeanour in this perplexed pilgrimage, where we still are and he no longer is; and if we can imitate the noble qualities that were in him, he will not have died to us, but be still, in a nobler manner, living.</p>
<p><closer><salute><pb id="pg-28-253" n="28:253"/><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Sir. May Heaven&#x2019;s blessing and consolation be with you all. I must not write farther on such a subject. I am</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There is still no decision on our case. The &#x201C;end of <date when="1853-06">june</date>&#x201C; is past, and the end of <date when="1853-07">july</date>, and here we are drawing towards the end of <date when="1853-08">August</date>; and big matters of state still keep <hi rend="italic">us</hi> where we were.</p>
<p>I wrote to the Duke of Argyll a gentle <hi rend="italic">memento</hi> the other day,&#x2014;who, as I learn otherwise, has really concerned himself in the business, and takes interest in it:&#x2014;here is his answer this moment come to hand. From which we learn that matters stand precisely where they did; and that we must still wait,&#x2014;with hope. I engaged him to write to me again the instant a decision is arrived at; and I take it for granted he will do so: you shall then instantly hear from me; and in the meantime, need not send any answer,&#x2014;nor abate or increase any hopes you might have before entertained. The good Mrs Glen&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> is nobler to me than any eloquence; and I know one person that will be sorry and disappointed enough, if, after all, the issue be mere nothing!</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your Note <supplied>[whi]</supplied>ch came this morning was a great comfort to me, as the last <supplied>[to]</supplied>o was. I get no other accounts from Scotsbrig which are so <supplied>[cl]</supplied>ear as yours. My poor Mother continues still very very weak, I can well see: alas, alas;&#x2014;but what is capable to be done by way of help to her, that at least you do; and she seems to like your waiting on her the best. I wish I knew of anything I could be of service in. There are <hi rend="italic">Books</hi> enough here, for example: cannot I send you some Book, for your slack hours; and of what <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> would you like it? Tell me if you want that.</p>
<p>I wrote yesterday to you at Dumfries; I hope James will open the Letter; for it was mainly to announce that the Penknives had arrived safe; that Chorley thought them of excellent promise, and had decided to keep both; which I was very glad of. The <hi rend="italic">price</hi> also I will remember, and take care of. Another commission, in the meantime, was added in the Note of yesterday: that of getting me <supplied>[anothe]</supplied>r pair of gloves from Dinwiddie!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Dinwiddie, hosier, High St., Dumfries.</note> You can tell James not to both<supplied>[er him]</supplied>self with that, but to let it fall, at least till you retur<supplied>[n]</supplied> home.</p>
<p>We have very bad weather here; blustering winds with much intermittent heavy rain: the harvest is over in these parts, but much is yet dependent in other more backward quarters; and it is understood that the general harvest this year will not prove a good one. The flour has already risen, &#x201C;the French,&#x201C; it appears, are busy buying wheat from us, their own stock of bread threatening to be short. Perhaps a little poverty will do our foolish people no ill, <pb id="pg-28-255" n="28:255"/>for they have at present only too big wages considering what use they turn them to.</p>
<p>As we are changing <hi rend="italic">roofs</hi>, the rain was far from welcome on this occasion! Parts of the old roof remain; nay the <hi rend="italic">back</hi> is already covered with an excellent new one: but sometimes we had big gaps depending only on the shelter of tarpaulins; and a <hi rend="italic">drop</hi> here and there was unpleasantly visible in the upper rooms. Three Irishmen moreover, headmen, unacquainted probably with the nature of lath and plaster, have been successively down upon my poor bedroom,&#x2014;not quite thro&#x2019;, only their hoofs thro&#x2019;, and on one occasion <hi rend="italic">half</hi> the person of a gentleman of that Nation, who hastily saved himself up again by the arms! So that the ceiling (which they instantly <hi rend="italic">dit up</hi> again) looks very piebald, and there has been much hasty sweeping away of dry dust &#x26;c. But on the whole they are swift, <foreign>gleg</foreign>, excellent workers these that we have, and as many of them as can get elbow-room together; and they are really getting on fast and well; and we endure the tumult, in hope of being <hi rend="italic">deaf</hi> there henceforth, and delivered from intolerable nuisance. Chelsea is all building &#x26; spreading (as London wholly is); by no means so quiet a place as when we knew it first, and people thought in<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;it.&#x201C;</note> &#x201C;too relaxing, so near the river.&#x201C; I hope to get a really good room upstairs, and to know no disturbances from <hi rend="italic">noise</hi> for the future. As I sometimes say: since the world can do me no good at all, it is fair I should have a little less mischief from it, in certain manageable departments!&#x2014; In spite of these carpenterings, I manage to sleep fully better than usual of late; poor Jane too holds out, tho&#x2019; evidently rather weakly, under such annoyances.</p>
<p>You can tell my Mother I have got no word about poor Mrs Glen&#x2019;s Petition yet: the Duke of Argyll answered me handsomely so far as words went, but evidently <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not predict the issue: I forwarded his Note to Mrs Glen; and both of us must just wait in silence till the head of Lord Aberdeen (none of the most potent engines, I think, tho&#x2019; a very <foreign><hi rend="italic">canny</hi></foreign> one) have brought forth its product.</p>
<p>For the rest, the Town is grown far <hi rend="italic">quieter;</hi> really wonderfully vacant in the westerly streets,&#x2014;about 100,000 people being on their travels, more speed to them! I <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to work and study; but cannot boast yet that I succeed almost at all.&#x2014; &#x2014; I must out now, and walk; nay the very post will be gone if I linger. <closer><salute>Give my dear Mother the assurance (which she does not need) that my best affection is ever with her: may God bless her and you all!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>This morning there came a Newspaper from Alick, with the comfortable two strokes on it; I inclose you the Cover, to give you a moment&#x2019;s satisfaction by the sight of it. In the Newspaper itself there was nothing but the usual <hi rend="italic">hogshead</hi> of dirty wash; rumours of &#x201C;elections,&#x201C; abuses of governors, quarrels with brother editors, and so forth; which I can retain here, without damage, for lighting of pipes,</p>
<p>On friday I wrote to Jean; so have no news more. I hope Jean will soon answer me;&#x2014;may she have good news to send!</p>
<p>Our weather is getting quite cool in the evenings and morning: but is of great brightness (as today) when the sun fairly gets the upper hand, and usually hot enough still; tho&#x2019; we have had frequent very stormy rains. Our builders are very busy, and many of them; they are clever fellows, too; and I think will finish both soon and well. We have four weeks of it yet at the very least. John Chorley looks over everything for me; <foreign><hi rend="italic">gleg</hi></foreign> as a hawk; mounts twice or thrice a week by the outer ladder,&#x2014;it must be about 50 feet high on the very top of all: I never stir off the ground hitherto, and do not mean to ascend till there is <hi rend="italic">a staircase</hi>. The roof is now all on, so that we have nothing more to do with rain: this morning I fell asleep again in spite of the hammering overhead, and added <hi rend="italic">two hours</hi> to my otherwise deficient stock.&#x2014; Jane has gone out to walk; and so now must I. Not the least news about the Glen case yet; nothing for us but wait!&#x2014;</p>
<p><closer><salute>Dear good Mother, I have nothing but my wishes, affections, and heart&#x2019;s-prayers to send you: and, alas, what are those good for? May God bless you, and us all! In Him let us never cease to trust, for Time and Eternity.&#x2014;&#x2014; With love to all, Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Today I send you a <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> just come out, and another Booklet, of which you will not make much. I will inclose also 7/6 worth of stamps; which is the price of the <hi rend="italic">knives</hi> with carriage: I believe Chorley to be &#x201C;enjoying&#x201C; the sharpness of them very much; at least it was the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> we could do for him: and <pb id="pg-28-257" n="28:257"/>I am very much obliged to James &#x26; you. Perhaps I ought to have made the payment not to you but to James? It will be all the same, I calculate.</p>
<p>Of my poor Mother I have heard nothing at all since you wrote: I may say I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> of her continually; but there is, I fancy, little to be said or to be heard. I beg for a word at any rate (it cannot come now before Monday, unless you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> already written); and bid you say to her that my sad and pious affection is ever with her. Does she still talk about Dumfries? I know not whether that might be rightly feasible: but if so, it might perhaps do good. I cannot judge; alas, I cannot help; I can <hi rend="italic">do</hi> nothing, but send my empty wishes!</p>
<p>The Dr I suppose is still in Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> I owe him a Note: but he would have written, had there any specific news come to him.&#x2014; Jamie, I conclude, is busy with his harvest: we have terribly wet weather here;&#x2014;yesterday (Monday) was such a day of downpouring as I have seldom seen.</p>
<p>The carpenters &#x26;c are getting on in spite of weather: they are, this day, laying the floor (finishing that), and are perhaps about the <hi rend="italic">noisiest</hi>. I get on wonderfully in spite of the uproar,&#x2014;was turned out, this morning, however, by unbearable knocking &#x26; <hi rend="italic">bashing</hi>, and went for a long walk before breakfast.&#x2014; &#x2014; I keep as busy as I can; but to little effect: the only thing is, I <hi rend="italic">won&#x2019;t</hi> be beaten; as my Father used to say, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll ga<hi rend="italic">r</hi> mysel&#x2019; do it!&#x201C; If I had a &#x201C;perfectly quiet room&#x201C; (as I hope to have in a short time), I must <hi rend="italic">strip</hi> and at it.&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>Dear Jean, I am in great haste and confusion, as is too often my case; but I would not let the week close without this poor two-words to my dear Mother &#x26; you. Blessings on you all.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>It is a good few days since I heard of you, and longer since I wrote: but I conclude there has been no news from Scotsbrig, or else you would have at once forwarded it. I heard from Jean after her arrival there; the account favourable so far as we could look for such: I wrote to her today; and shall perhaps hear again soon. She mentioned that my Mother had <hi rend="italic">forbidden</hi> your being sent for, as there was nothing you had not already done so far as possible.</p>
<p>I have been rather below par for a week past; bilious in the <hi rend="italic">unusual</hi> way,&#x2014;which, however, will perhaps come to good. The weather is very bad; rain and blustery winds frequent, with a very cool temperature: today, with wind <hi rend="italic">north</hi>, we have had a great deal of violent rain; yesterday, wind <hi rend="italic">south-west</hi>, <pb id="pg-28-258" n="28:258"/>was as heavy a deluge as I have seen for long. As our new roof is not very complete, this does not answer well to us.&#x2014; However, the adroit little fellows bear a hand lustily; and we are getting on not so ill, in spite of weather. The <hi rend="italic">noise</hi> they make from 6 a.m. till 8 p.m. is prodigious; especially these two days when they have been flooring;&#x2014;an operation now complete, I do hope; for we have had the ceiling of my room violated 5 times, by Irish gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> unacquainted (I suppose) with the nature of laths! Chorley is the perfection of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Baur&#xE4;the</hi></foreign> [building supervisor]; mounts aloft like a bird; got all wetted today; shuns no labour;&#x2014;and hopes to make a &#x201C;canty thing of it&#x201C; before long. Truly if I can get a soundproof room, it will be about the best thing this London Universe can now yield me.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I need not tell you I am heartily glad at this finish of our affair; I had begun of late to be quite impatient for the end of it, and not without misgivings now and then which, however, I rebuked as imaginary and hypochondriacal merely. Everything is well that ends well!</p>
<p>On the whole, this annual &#xa3;50 is just about the best I ever steadily expected: once I spoke of &#xa3;70 to an official person, but was answered in vehement <pb id="pg-28-259" n="28:259"/>protest. Let us take it thankfully; and long long may the good Mrs Glen live to get benefit of it!</p>
<p>I have written to the Duke of Argyll about the Gift Mrs Glen proposes, which seems a very handsome and appropriate one; as the Duke is probably in the Highlands, or one knows not where, there can be no answer for a week or so; but it is not likely the answer can be negative when it does come. My own Copy of the Persian Book, tho&#x2019; I cannot read it, shall be precious to me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably copies of William Glen&#x2019;s trans. of the Old Testament into Persian, see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530502-TC-JOGL-01">TC to <sic>JG</sic><corr>JOGL</corr>, <date when="1853-05-02">2 May</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-01/lt-18150614-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:51</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1815-06-14">14 June 1815</date></corr></ref>.</note> So soon as the Duke&#x2019;s answer reaches me, you shall hear again; and may then forward both the Books to me;&#x2014;any Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Bookseller can send them to London in his Parcel without inconvenience; or if there <hi rend="italic">be</hi> difficulty, then do you inquire for <hi rend="italic">Menzies</hi>, Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Publisher.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Menzies (<date when="1808">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879">79</date>), bookseller.</note></p>
<p>Mrs Glen is quite right in regard to the Duke of Argyll&#x2019;s influence and benevolent diligence in the matter now achieved; but Lord Breadalbane &#x26;c &#x26;c spoke, and indeed everybody was very kind so far as his means went. <closer><salute>We will thank everybody,&#x2014;and Heaven, above all, and inclusive of all!&#x2014; Yours sincerely</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Sir,&#x2014;</salute>It appears Sir James Stephen has had the friendly charity to write to you on certain annoyances we are exposed to here, from a tenant of your Father&#x2019;s, in No. 6 of this street. He forwards to my wife the humane and courteous answer you were pleased to return, for which allow me now to offer my sincere and cordial thanks. Surely I am much indebted for this kindness, and in fact I hope you will never know <hi rend="italic">how</hi> much, for it is not a very happy experience to be put in the condition of knowing!</p>
<p>You do not hide from me that it is uncertain whether you can effectually help. And in truth I perceive clearly there will be but one way of being effectually helped, namely that of putting the House No. 6 into repair and letting it to a Tenant of the kind called <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi> Tenant amenable to the laws of human politeness, and with habits of life analogous to those of his neighbours in this street, to several of whom (as I incidentally learn) such <pb id="pg-28-260" n="28:260"/>change would be welcome, tho&#x2019; to none of them nearly so vital a relief as to me. Such tenants are easily got in this quarter, when means are taken; nay, I understand, my Neighbour of No. 4, a wealthy man, is not disinclined to purchase the house, if it were on sale. You suggest further that I should apply to my Landlord. Alas, Sir, I am my own Landlord, and on that side there is no help for me. Not very many months ago, after living 18 years here, without annoyance, amid neighbours all of quiet, cleanly, and even elegant habits, I did not hesitate to purchase (so soon as there was opportunity to do so) a long lease of this House, and to lay out far more money than I now like to think of in thorough repair of the same.</p>
<p>This painful operation was about completed <hi rend="italic">before</hi> my poor Neighbour of No. 6&#x2014; who seems a worthy unexceptionable man in his way, and whose washings and other unpleasant habits and processes I had contrived to disregard&#x2014;took it into his head to start this new line of <hi rend="italic">live stock</hi> industry and amusement, when it was too late for me to fly from him, as would otherwise have been the clearly open remedy. That is the sad fact, and I crave permission to make that also clear, since the matter is on hand. Of what has passed since on that sorry scene of winged vocal creatures &#x2026; my whole strength to say nothing. I have never in my life come athwart a tract of miserable grievances at once so contemptible and so intolerable, about which, except to men of delicate character, and acquainted like yourself with sedentary and studious ways it is worse than useless to speak or to appeal.</p>
<p>You may believe me, I am quite ashamed to trouble Mr. Martin Sen<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or you on such a matter. But in fine, what can I do? No Court or Judge, I believe, can give me the smallest redress. In a state of nature, one could <hi rend="italic">shoot</hi> those miserable winged and other vermin, or the inhuman owner of them if he were so madly obstinate and cruel; but in this civilized state this mode of relief is by no means permissable nor has any other been provided! I have nothing for it therefore but to appeal in <foreign><hi rend="italic">forma pauperis</hi></foreign> [as a poor man] in the Court of general Humanity, asking you as a brother student, to be my Advocate and intercessor there. <closer><salute>With many thanks and apologies,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We got Mary&#x2019;s Letter yesterday morning, and today John&#x2019;s has come; both of which we have reason to be thankful for. You are not worse than you were, <pb id="pg-28-261" n="28:261"/>dear Mother; and you are very calm and clear in mind,&#x2014;as you have been in all circumstances! Let us trust in One Higher; by whom all things are ordered, not otherwise than <hi rend="italic">well!</hi> We have cause to do so.</p>
<p>Here is a little Note which will give you pleasure. Mrs Glen&#x2019;s case is at last settled; they have given her a Pension of &#xa3;50; which is just about the sum that I expected at the very best: as she has already &#xa3;30 a year purchased by her Husband, this will make &#xa3;80 in all, which will be a quite suitable sum for her. I am really glad the matter is so settled; for I have had a good deal of bother about it, and so many things go cross with one, I should have liked ill this too had quite failed. It is almost the only little <hi rend="italic">victory</hi> I have gained this long while. Mrs Glen, it will appear, attributes the result a good deal to the pains I took; in which I will neither contradict nor confirm her. If the fact be of any real worth to me at all, it is chiefly or only because my good old Mother will have a moment&#x2019;s satisfaction in thinking I helped in such a result.</p>
<p>John is perhaps still with you when this arrives? I had sent him a little Note which w<hi rend="italic">d arrive</hi> in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Saturday night; but the wretched Pharisees of that City forebade it to be delivered (as I gather) till Monday after he was gone,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">less</hi> power to them! We have cool weather here, after much blustery rain; wind N.W. and a bright sun, by which I hope Jamie is profiting. Our builders advance as swiftly as can be expected, and with not <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than the necessary tumult. This morning in spite of their hammering overhead, I fell sound asleep after they arrived.&#x2014; Remind Jean of her duty to write. <closer><salute>We send you our love, dear Mother, as ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<p>I had a letter from Maggie<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh, staying at Auchtertool.</note> since you and your wife were there, but she did <pb id="pg-28-262" n="28:262"/>not say anything of Helen beyond sending her love&#x2014;so I was shocked to find there must be an operation after all. I had fancied <hi rend="italic">that</hi> had been set aside once for all as not required by the nature of her complaint. Poor soul! I have long despaired of any recovery for her but I had got to think this sort of thing might last without worsening for many years&#x2014;</p>
<p>Here we are again in a crisis of discomfort, as you know. for the last week however Irish labourers have ceased to tumble down thro the up-stairs ceilings, bringing cartloads of dust and broken laths and plaster along with them&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">five</hi> times this accident occurred!!&#x2014;the last time within a yard of my head as I was stooping over a drawer&#x2014;had he dislocated my neck as might so easily have happened one of us would have been provided with &#x201C;a silent appartment&#x201C; enough, without further botheration. It is a fine time for John Chorley who has constituted himself the overruling Providence of the whole thing and is to be seen running up and down the long ladder in front of the house the first thing of a morning when one looks abroad&#x2014; How with <hi rend="italic">his</hi> head he dare&#x2014;surprises me. Meanwhile neither M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C nor I have set eyes on the silent appartment which is progressing so noisily over head. for the rest the Cocks are kept in the house by the Washerman till about nine in the morning and our sufferings thro them are rather of an imaginative sort&#x2014; London is as empty as I ever saw it&#x2014;one was thankful almost for the return of Plattnauer&#x2014; He made the most particular inquiries after you and the Lady&#x2014;is less mad considerably than last year&#x2014;in fact shows no mad symptoms at present but spending money with a rashness!</p>
<p>I hear often from Count Reichenbach, he has bought a large farm within 15 miles of Philadelphia&#x2014;and asks <hi rend="italic">me</hi> questions about draining and &#x201C;engines for making drain-tiles&#x201C; but he looks forward I think with secret desire to <hi rend="italic">a war</hi> in which he may take part and get himself handsomely killed, rather than drain land in America&#x2014;</p>
<p>Mazzini is in hopes of kicking up another shine almost immedialy He told me when I last saw him he might go off again within ten days&#x2014;I am out of all patience at his reckless folly&#x2014;if one did not hear every day of new arrests and executions one might let him scheme and talk hoping it might all end in smoke&#x2014;but it ends in blood&#x2014;and that is horrible&#x2014;1300 arrests in the Papal states within a week!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The arrests in Rome of Giuseppe Petroni and others were on <date when="1853-08-15">15 Aug.</date> (<hi rend="italic">Scritti</hi> 27:327).

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1853-08-10">10 Aug.</date></note> came ten days ago; very kind, and however late, surely right welcome! You ought to stir yourself up a little, and actually begin to speak to me again. If we are getting old, that is no reason why we should fall silent, and entirely abstruse to one another. Alas, I do not find as I grow older that the number of articulate-speaking human souls increases around me, in proportion to the inarticulate and palavering species! I am often abundantly solitary in heart; and regret the old days when we used to speak oftener together.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-264" n="28:264"/>I have not quitted Town this year at all; have resisted calls to Scotland both of a gay and a sad description (for the Ashburtons are gone to John of Groat&#x2019;s House,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A point on the N coast of Caithness, considered the most northerly point in Gt. Britain. According to D. A. Wilson, TC wrote to Lady Ashburton, at Achany, Bonar Bridge, Sutherland, <date when="1853-09-08">8 Sept.</date>, enclosing an extensive MS &#x201C;For Lord Ashburton (on a rainy day),&#x201C; proposing a national portrait gallery: &#x201C;of all kinds of excellent Pictures, in Galleries or elsewhere, unspeakably the usefullest and most interesting to ingenuous souls are excellent Portraits of Historical Men. Perhaps in no class of Pictures, if we will consider well, can Pictorial genius better display itself; the Portraits done by Raphael are equally supreme over other men&#x2019;s as his so-called ideal paintings are;&#x2014;nay perhaps it will one day be discovered that here is his and all men&#x2019;s veritable <hi rend="italic">ideal;</hi> here, in fitly (instead of unfitly) interpreting the real; that, in Painting as in writing, and in Art everywhere, the only lasting Poetry is, after all <hi rend="italic">History</hi>. &#x2026; Had any Painter caught up for me, 1800 years ago, an actual exact likeness of the Man Jesus, how gladly would I give for it the immense mammoth shipload of Holy Families, Flights to Egypt, Flayings of Bartholomew, &#x26;c., &#x26;c.! But the then Painters were not lucky enough to do that. And since they have irretrievably neglected that, what are all these &#x2018;ideals&#x2019; to me? A kind of mockery. &#x2026; [T]o us Non-Painters, and to the world at large, a <hi rend="italic">Gallery of true Historic Portraits</hi> would be extremely beneficial and delightful. &#x2026; There exist great quantities of Historical English Portraits in the Houses of the Nobility, in the Picture Market, and fixed or floating over England; part of which might be acquired by money. &#x2026; In her Majesty&#x2019;s Royal House, there are scattered many important Historical Portraits &#x2026; ; these perhaps her Majesty would generously consent to have collected into one Place, where to herself they would not be lost, and to her people they would first become accessible and useful. Majesty&#x2019;s example would of course work on the Nobility, and render donations or sales less and less unusual;&#x2014;and in fine if the Gallery <hi rend="italic">succeeded</hi>, i.e., could gain for itself among men the character of a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> National Pantheon, I see not why patriotic Noblemen &#x2026; should not in many cases be willing that Portraits of their Ancestors &#x2026; should go to the National Collection. &#x2026; A fine and noble possibility, I do esteem it,&#x2014;I from the distance; but of course know little what unseen impediments there may be. I can only say <foreign><hi rend="italic">Faxit</hi></foreign> [let it be done]; and so in a very hearty, and perhaps rather disinterested manner&#x201C; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 5:39&#x2013;46). The collection of the National Portrait Gallery was founded by act of Parliament, <date when="1856">1856</date>; the present gallery in London opened, <date when="1896">1896</date>.</note> or the Scottish <hi rend="italic">Thule</hi>, to rusticate &#x26; hunt; and, alas, in poor old Annandale a tragedy seems preparing for me, and the thing I have dreaded all my days is perhaps now drawing nigh, ah me!)&#x2014;I felt so utterly broken and disgusted with the jangle of last year&#x2019;s locomotion, I judged it would be better to sit obstinately still, and let my thoughts <hi rend="italic">settle</hi> (into sediment and into clearness, as it might be); and so, in spite of great and peculiar noises moreover, here I am and remain. London is not a bad place at all in these months,&#x2014;with its long clean streets, green parks, and nobody in them, or nobody one has ever seen before. Out of La Trappe,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In NW France, where the Cistercian order, noted for observing silence, was founded.</note> which does not suit a Protestant man, there is perhaps no place where one can be so perfectly alone. I might study even; but, as I said, there are noises going on; a <hi rend="italic">last</hi> <pb id="pg-28-265" n="28:265"/>desperate spasmodic effort of building,&#x2014;a new top-story to the house, out of which is to be made one &#x201C;spacious room&#x201C; (so they call it, tho&#x2019; it is under 20 feet square) where there shall be air <foreign><hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi></foreign>, light from the sky, and no <hi rend="italic">sound</hi>, not even that of the Cremorne Cannons, shall find access to me any more! Such is the prophecy; may the gods grant it! We shall see now in about a month;&#x2014;then <foreign>adieu</foreign> to mortar-tubs to all Eternity:&#x2014;I endure the thing, meanwhile, as well as I can; might run to a certain rural retreat near by,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Addiscombe.</note> if I liked at any time; but do not yet: the worst uproar here is but a trifle to that of German inns, and horrible squeaking choking railway trains; and one does not go to seek this, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is here of its own will, and for a purpose! Seriously, I had for 12 years had such a soundproof inaccessible Apartment schemed out in my head; and last year, under a poor helpless builder, had finally given it up: but Chelsea, as London generally, swelling out as if it were mad, grows every year noisier; a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> builder turned up, and with a last paroxysm of enthusiasm, I set him to. My notion is, he will succeed; in which case, it will be a great possession to me for the rest of my life. Alas, this is not the kind of <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> I could have coveted, and could once get,&#x2014;with green fields and clear skies to accompany it! But one must take such as can be had,&#x2014;and thank the gods. Even so, my friend. In the course of about a year of that garret sanctuary, I hope to have swept away much litter from my existence: in fact I am already, by dint of more obstinate quiescence in such circumstances as there are, intrinsically growing fairly sounder in nerves. What a business a poor human being has with those nerves of his, with that crazy clay tabernacle of his! Enough, enough: there will be all Eternity to rest in, as Arnauld said: &#x201C;why in such a fuss, little sir?&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Antoine Arnauld (<date when="1612">1612</date>&#x2013;<date when="1694">94</date>), French philosopher and Jansenist theologian; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340121-TC-SA-01"><sic>7:83</sic><corr>TC to SA, <date when="1834-01-21">21 Jan. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>You &#x201C;apologise&#x201C; for sending people to me:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1853-08-10">10 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I have lately made one or two drafts on your goodness,&#x2014;which I hate to do, both because you meet them so generously, &#x26; because you never give me an opportunity of revenge,&#x2014;and mainly in the case of Miss Bacon, who has a private history that entitles her to high respect, &#x26; who could be helped only by facilitating her Shakespeare studies. &#x2026; But do not fancy that I send any one to you heedlessly; for I value your time at its rate to nations, &#x26; refuse many more letters than I give.&#x201C;</note> O you of little faith!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 14:31.</note> Never dream of such a thing: nay, whom <hi rend="italic">did</hi> you send?

As for Miss Bacon we find her, with her modest shy <pb id="pg-28-266" n="28:266"/>dignity, with her solid character and strange enterprise, a real acquisition; and hope we shall now see more of her, now that she has come nearer us to lodge. I have not in my life seen anything so tragically <hi rend="italic">quixotic</hi> as her Shakspeare enterprise: alas, alas, there can be nothing but sorrow, toil, and utter disappointment in it for her! I do cheerfully what I can,&#x2014;which is far more than she <hi rend="italic">asks</hi> of me (for I have not seen a prouder silent soul);&#x2014;but there is not the least possibility of truth in the notion she has taken up: and the hope of ever proving it, or finding the least document that countenances it, is equal to that of vanquishing the windmills by stroke of lance. I am often truly sorry about the poor lady: but she troubles nobody with her difficulties, with her theories; she must try the matter to the end, and charitable souls must further her so far.</p>
<p>Clough is settled in his Office;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As examiner in the privy council&#x2019;s education office.</note> gets familiarized to it rapidly (he says), and seems to be doing well. I see little of him hitherto; I did not, and will not, try to influence him in his choice of Countries; but I think he is now likely to continue here, and here too he may do us some good. Of America, at least of New England, I can perceive he has brought away an altogether kindly, almost filial impression,&#x2014;especially of a certain man who lives in that section of the Earth. More power to his elbow!&#x2014; &#x2014;Thackeray has very rarely come athwart me since his return:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thackeray had sailed with Clough to the U.S., <date when="1852-10-30">30 Oct. 1852</date>, and then returned in the spring.

I rather dread explosions in his history. A <hi rend="italic">big</hi>, fierce, weeping, hungry man; not a strong one. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi!</hi></foreign>&#x2014; But I must end, I must end. Your Letter awakened in me, while reading it, one mad notion. I said to myself, &#x201C;Well, if I live to finish this Frederic impossibility, or even to fling it fairly into the fire, why should not I go, in my old days, and see Concord, Yankee land, and that man again, after all!&#x201C;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1853-08-10">10 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;You are an inveterate European, &#x26; rightfully stand for your polity &#x26; antiquities &#x26; culture: I have long since forborne to importune you with America. &#x2026; And yet since Thackeray&#x2019;s adventure, I have often thought how you would bear the pains &#x26; penalties; &#x26; have painted out your march triumphal. I was at New York, lately, &#x2026; &#x26; fell into some traces of Thackeray, who has made a good mark in this country, by a certain manly blurting out of his opinion in various companies, where so much honesty was rare &#x26; useful.

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>I was very much comforted and greatly obliged by your little Note,&#x2014;of which I had great need! Our dear old Mother seems to be no worse at any rate. There is nobody ever gives me anything like so vivid a picture of her actual situation as you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean had written, <date when="1853-09-06">6 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Jack is at my hand scribbling till he is like to turn my head. &#x2026; If Mary do not derange my plans again I mean to be here a fortnight at least.

<p>Inclosed are 10 stamps, which I owe your James; in consequence of the <hi rend="italic">Bank</hi> Transaction with Mary.

<p>There is another Inclosure here with your Name on it, which I wish you to change into money, and keep for the purpose of paying your railway expenses at least in these journeys to and fro.&#x2014; I was wont to gratify myself by making my dear Mother a little Gift every year: but this year, Jack has so confused me with talking about &#x201C;bottles of wine,&#x201C; plenty of money &#x26;c &#x26;c that I know not what to do in that matter; and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> must now, with your best discretion, ascertain whether a &#xa3;10 to her just now will not be a superfluity and an impertinence.&#x2014; On the whole, it is best to <hi rend="italic">inclose</hi> the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Draught (dated <date when="1853-09-16">16 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>) which I will also put in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> name (but <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is for my Mother); and leave you to manage with your best discretion.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got your Letter here this morning: I had had one from Jean, dated the day before; whose account of our Mother was much the same, only <hi rend="italic">without</hi> those symptoms in the matter of sleep &#x26;c, which I hope are only temporary. I suppose the state of our poor frail patient varies from day to day, and almost from hour to hour: she seems however to have a great deal of spirit and perfect clearness,&#x2014;the dear and good old woman! Ah me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We came out hither last night towards sunset, Jane and I,&#x2014;Jane with the intention of returning for a couple of days about Friday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Wed.</note> so soon as she has <hi rend="italic">initiated</hi> me here; I meaning to continue as long as I possibly can. The situation at Chelsea was grown palpably unbearable! The Carpenters &#x26;c who are prosecuting their enterprise with a laudable alacrity, and making a tremendous noise, had decided now at last to cut thro&#x2019; the floor and ceiling (their own new <hi rend="italic">floor</hi> and our old topmost ceiling), and come fairly in upon us, in tempests of dust as well as tumult, for the purpose of making <hi rend="italic">a staircase</hi> by way of entrance to their room,&#x2014;which room is now almost <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> in essentials, having <hi rend="italic">got</hi> its first coat of plaster &#x26;c &#x26;c. Add to which fine prospect, <hi rend="italic">new</hi> explosion from the winged forces of our neighbour Ronca (cocks crowing in the night time, parrots &#x26;c in the day); item that Fanny our maid is going off; that &#x26;c &#x26;c. Poor Jane herself is almost quite out of sleep; and little fit to contend with such a chaos of evil circumstances, which, however, she bravely does.&#x2014; It was almost like getting out of Bedlam and Malebolge,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bedlam, popular name for a London insane asylum. Malebolge, the eighth circle of Hell in Dante&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi>.</note> to get out hither last night,&#x2014; into the perfect &#x201C;divine silence,&#x201C; the bright green fields and bushes, and the beautiful sunset! Of course one will not feel it that way above a day or two: however I have Books &#x26;c with me; I will try in all ways to do my best,&#x2014;and intend to hold out here to the last minute that will answer; surely at least till there is hope of a <hi rend="italic">defensible bedroom</hi> at home: this, from precautions &#x26; new inventions, I expect soon that my <hi rend="italic">old</hi> bedroom will be; not for ten days can the new staircase be completed. Alas, if there were but a steady poor old woman (dumb &#x26; deaf I think w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be an advantage) who <supplied>[would]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> do me a poor mutton chop &#x26;c daily, I think at present I could like to stay here, <hi rend="italic">mute</hi> and undisturbed by unreasonable noises, for the greater part <pb id="pg-28-269" n="28:269"/>of my life to come. For the last fifteen months especially I have had a terrible time of it;&#x2014;as indeed (I perceive) the poor man with too thin a skin is pretty likely to have in all months more or less, and in all places under this Sun: God help him; had he the &#x201C;genius&#x201C; of Shakspeare or of 20 Shaksp<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, he buys it very dear!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Write us a word as heretofore,&#x2014;to this Address; and may all good be with you and your Household where you now are.

<dateline><place>Addiscombe Farm</place>, <date when="1853-09-15">15 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1853</date></dateline>
<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>This morning your Letter of the <date when="1853-09-11">11<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> from Heidingsfeld reached me out here, whither we have fled for a little quiet, in the absence of the hospitable owners. I have been looking with great impatience latterly, for some news from you; and now I perceive your last Letter must have been <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> on its road towards me, or else still worse must have befallen! Here is, at once, what I can say in reference to that misfortune, in the absence of all my papers which are at Chelsea.</p>
<p>One Letter from Heidingsfeld, and only one, have I received: the date, I guess from memory, must have been about <hi rend="italic">two</hi> months hence (say <date when="1853-07-11">11<hi rend="italic">th</hi> july</date>);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1853-07-22">22 July</date>.</note> I answered that in two or three days, introducing (if I recollect aright) two or three Berlin questions; and, what is still more important, and of course is very fresh in my recollection, a Bank Draught from Lord Ashburton to pay Weber for his Prints at Bonn. Your silence all this while I ascribed to some delay or other in getting Weber&#x2019;s Receipt for me;&#x2014;and was of course disappointed at not finding it, or any allusion to it, in the present otherwise so welcome Letter. However, on a little consideration, I begin to see there is essentially nothing <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> but your second Letter: for you <hi rend="italic">answer</hi> certain Berlin queries; therefore must have received them; therefore must have received &#x26;c &#x26;c. If Weber&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">receipt</hi> was in that lost Letter, you will have to make him send another; and that will cure the main damage. Or it is possible he was <pb id="pg-28-270" n="28:270"/>directed at once to send his Receipt <hi rend="italic">to Lord Ashburton?</hi> In that case, it may have arrived all right, and never have been mentioned to me; for they are far off in the Highlands these some weeks. In any case I persuade myself there has nothing gone fundamentally awry: but this loss of the letter does disquiet me; and I beg for a word from you about it without any delay.</p>
<p>I had been diligently preparing a good many new questions, labelled &#x201C;For Neuberg in Berlin&#x201C;; and they all hang now, on their several fragments of paper, duly grasped in the <hi rend="italic">Clip</hi> (I think that is the name of it, the steel finger-and-thumb) on my table at Chelsea;&#x2014;and will not be answered on this occasion! However, we can send them to Preuss, it appears; and in fact they were not of much consequence, many of them, nor worth detaining you in hot solitary Berlin. I never yet dare tell myself that I will write on <hi rend="italic">Frederic;</hi> for indeed the thing is still an <hi rend="italic">Impossibility</hi> to me; but I have continued <foreign>havering</foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> about the edges of it, very unhappy on account of it; and one day I must do something or other with it.</p>
<p>My dear old Mother has, as you have heard, given us a good deal of alarm since you went. Alas, she is now past 82; and the inevitable cannot be supposed to be very distant! For the last year or more she had been growing visibly feebler; but in <date when="1853-07">july</date> last, matters seemed to come to a crisis: and after almost a miraculous escape, our poor patient seems ever since to be a degree better, and a hope that she may yet be spared us for a while, is but too prone to rise in one. Ever since I have had consciousness in me, this thing has been my terror: alas, alas, it is the doom of all men, a merciful as well as stern one;&#x2014;and it is not for me to forget that it has been long delayed, and promises to fall as gently as it well could! My brave old Mother is perfectly composed; has her faculties of mind all perfect, and is clear and quick of thought and perceptive as she ever was, tho&#x2019; reduced so low in bodily strength Two of my sisters attend her alternately, their own households being at no great distance; and &#x201C;the Doctor&#x201C; (as we call him) holds himself always within reach.</p>
<p>Except expressly summoned on that melancholy errand, I decided not to leave London, or travel at all, this year; I accordingly rejected all offers, to the Ashburton Highlands &#x26;c, and have steadily kept at Chelsea,&#x2014;where, tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> was less attainable than usual, I actually find my health rather improving, simply by <hi rend="italic">dint of sitting still</hi>. No other remedy, I believe, has been provided me in this world: having too thin a skin, I must, once for all, expose it to the fewest annoyances, the fewest emotions, possible; and bear what burdens won&#x2019;t drop off in that way, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> kicking. The Autumn time, when Western London is like La Trappe, has been very pleasant this year in respect of weather too: I might have studied even, had not so much else been upon me,&#x2014;had not still other, unexpected things come in the wind!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-271" n="28:271"/>You will be surprised to learn we are again busy <hi rend="italic">building</hi> in Chelsea since you last heard of me! The case was, an ever-increasing miscellany of noises (<hi rend="italic">cocks</hi> not wanting) had been annoying us exceedingly, me at least, for many months past; intimating that the progress of Free-trade, and development of Beaver Hudsonism, had reached even Cheyne Row, and banished the old quiet from it,&#x2014;not to speak of <hi rend="italic">temprary</hi> cocks &#x26;c. In a paroxysm of many feelings therefore (not all of them <hi rend="italic">pleasant!</hi>) I decided to realize the idea I had had for 12 years past: of an apartment free to air and absolutely inaccessible to sound,&#x2014;at once perfectly ventilated and <hi rend="italic">deaf</hi>. And that accordingly is a-doing, and is even nearly done, if it will prosper when finished! The top story of the house; a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> top-story built over all the others: that is the new miraculous apart<hi rend="italic">t;</hi> and there I hope to receive you, of an evening, when you come down from Hampstead. We took a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Builder, one of Cubitt&#x2019;s, and that has been the basis of all success and despatch; really one of the cleverest Artist&#x2019;s I have ever seen in that kind; I have also been infinitely helped by a friendly and altogether skilful Mr Chorley of my acquaintance. And in short we had stood all the noise; and <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not be persuaded to move out hither to this little fairy palace (the beautifullest of all now empty Cottages), tho&#x2019; permitted and pressed,&#x2014;not till two days ago, when the noises outside and in, combined too with dust and demolition (for the <hi rend="italic">staircase</hi>, namely), became at last too formidable. I think of staying here for a week or two, so long as I can manage to find it pleasant: Jane, who had already a month of country in Scotland, who cares in general less for the country than I, and has work to do at home proposes, if not to leave me in the perfection of loneliness here, at least only to come and go. This is our history since you went.</p>
<p>Your account of Eckermann is highly interesting! Poor fellow, I wish he had assurance of <hi rend="italic">continuous</hi> &#x201C;bread-and-butter&#x201C;: but about 2 weeks ago I had a Note from somebody, a Clerk in the Bank, informing me that he had got some Goethe Autographs to sell for Eck<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (who had fallen unwell too, it appeared, but was getting better): the question of this Clerk was, How to sell said Autographs? I recommended to try Lord Ellesmere<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Egerton (<date when="1800">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857">1857</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8585"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 1st earl of Ellesmere; statesman and poet, whom TC had previously tried to interest in one of Eckermann&#x2019;s Goethe MSS; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470603-TC-JMA-01"><sic><sic>22:222</sic><corr>21:222</corr></sic><corr>TC to JMA, <date when="1847-06-03">3 June 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> with one of them. But poor E. has often been in my thoughts since;&#x2014;and I rather wish you would write a word of inquiry about him (to Weimar, I fancy; he <hi rend="italic">was</hi> still at Kiel, but about to go); and try to ascertain, in a delicate way, whether there is nothing even <hi rend="italic">we</hi> could do for him, at any rate whether his pecuniary strait has fairly passed? The Bank Clerk was so unmelodious a gentleman, I did not like cooperation with him farther. But surely something should be done for poor Eckermann if he is in difficulties on that side,&#x2014;and something perhaps <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be done, if not in Weimar (which seems disgracefully negligent), then perhaps <pb id="pg-28-272" n="28:272"/>among Goethe&#x2019;s admirers in this country. If you see a way for such a delicate inquiry, I really wish you would move a little in it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote to Eckermann and sent TC a copy of Eckermann&#x2019;s reply, <date when="1853-09-27">27 Sept.</date>, with his letter of <date when="1853-10-04">4 Oct.</date>, &#x201C;which may reassure you somewhat. The original is written in a very unsteady scrawling hand.&#x201C; Eckermann wrote that he had &#x201C;lost some time in Kiel through illness&#x201C; but that &#x201C;it worked out well, for the young Herzog of Weimar has asked me to return there. I hope my health will stand up to it (my handwriting is the barometer of my health). Say hello to Carlyle &#x2026; and when a new work of his is in prospect, let me know&#x201C; (trans.; MS: NLS 551.50).

<salute>Dear Marshall,</salute>
<p>The Tieck Portrait and <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>.,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> of which I shall be very glad, has not yet been heard of at Chelsea; but your Letter found me here yesterday,&#x2014;a beautiful, hospitable, and quite <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> place, near Croydon (and the Archbishop of Canterbury),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Old Palace of the archbishops of Canterbury was in Croydon.</note> whither I fled some days ago to escape the tumults of London, and catch a little of the <supplied>[skies]</supplied> of Summer under fair terms. We are again <hi rend="italic">building</hi> in Cheyne Row: a perfectly <hi rend="italic">sound proof</hi> apartment this time; <hi rend="italic">deaf</hi> utterly, did you even fire cannon beside it, and perfect in ventilation; such is the program,&#x2014;calculated to be the envy of surrounding &#x201C;enraged musicians,&#x201C; and an invaluable conquest to me henceforth, if it prosper!</p>
<p>I am very glad to hear of Her Royal Highness&#x2019;s munificent intentions at Weimar; and shall be proud and ready to do any little service I can towards forwarding the same. Beyond question, there could a man be procured here, able to teach the Weimar people English, on fair terms; and tho&#x2019; I have not myself much acquaintance with the class of persons in question, I could easily apply to those who have, and assist in selecting a man certifiable as fit, or the fittest our market would yield at the money in these Californian times. One man I already think of, and he is the only one I can recollect among my personal circle: a young man, bred as a School-assistant in the Islington region here, who applied to me lately to help him in getting a publisher for some German Translation he had been doing; and who, as the Translation was&#x2014;declared impossible, had two interviews with me about a post of amanuensis to myself, which latter is not yet entirely settled in the negative. The name of him is Ede; he possesses shrewdness, Cockney sharpness, a fair share of natural faculty; probably not much profundity of education; but has the advantage of being accustomed to teach, and of already knowing German in some fair manner. I also suppose he might be among the cheapest discoverable, if on any terms he were willing. He is wedded, tho&#x2019; I think hardly <pb id="pg-28-274" n="28:274"/>above 25; has <hi rend="italic">neat</hi> enough, inoffensive, quiet manners; certainly not much of a high air,&#x2014;in fact, a good deal the air of a clever London shopman; but capable of taking a better if he had the example well offered him. That is my recollection of Mr Ede; whose address<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Ede, Trinity Church Lane, Finchley.</note> I could probably dig out again were I at home; but whom I do not apply to in the present vague stage of the business. If a man of higher general education (which doubtless would be desirable) were determined on, perhaps the best chance, since existent salaries are inadmissible, would be to apply to some of the Professors in Edinburgh: a more accomplished youth could certainly be had there, I think, on not quite oppressive terms; nor would his <hi rend="italic">pronunciation</hi>, at Weimar, be much of a drawback. On the whole there are resources;&#x2014;and, as above said, I will willingly help in trying to do the best with them for Weimar&#x2019;s sake.</p>
<p>But first of all, you must evidently specify very much more distinctly what the thing in question practically is: 1<hi rend="italic">$DE</hi> what salary will be allowed (in English money, and with a fair estimate, on your part, of Weimar relative prices); 2<hi rend="italic">$DE</hi> whether there are any other advantages beyond the money; as free house &#x26;c &#x26;c. 3<hi rend="italic">$DE When</hi> is the man wanted? And for how long will his engagement be <hi rend="italic">certain</hi>, supposing he should not suit as a permanency. On all these and perhaps other points, you will have to take counsel with Her Royal Highness&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The grand duchess of Weimar.</note> adviser and managers in this matter; and so soon as anything definite is settled as to the main points, if you let me hear again, I will communicate with friend Ede, or do what else seems feasible for catching the suitable man.</p>
<p>Twice lately I have heard of Eckermann; and not in the joyfullest way. A certain Clerk in the Bank sent me within the last fortnight two Letters of E.&#x2019;s, and asked my advice about selling three or four <hi rend="italic">Goethe Autographs</hi>, which he had been forced to send over for that object. The Letters indicated <hi rend="italic">illness</hi> &#x26;c on poor E.&#x2019;s part; they were dated Kiel: I gave my advice about the Autographs; and greatly lamented, and do still, that poor E. was not in some way shielded from the pinch of utter poverty at any rate. He is thrifty enough, is not he? Privately speaking, it is not considered ornamental to the opulent Court of Weimar that Goethe&#x2019;s Ex-secretary should be left to extremities, if he is so amiable as he looks to the distant observer! But this, you perceive, is <hi rend="italic">privatissimum</hi>. I myself have been thinking, more than once, a certain <foreign><hi rend="italic">peculium</hi></foreign> [sum of money] for poor E. might be collected here, by private subscription, among the friends of Goethe,&#x2014;if hard came to hard, and nobody else w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do it. Of this also you must not speak (to hurt poor E.&#x2019;s feelings), except in the way of elucidation and to me. I am really concerned about the good genial innocent soul: it seems his poor boy<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl Eckermann (<date when="1834">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891">91</date>), painter and engraver.</note> also was unwell.&#x2014;My second notice was <pb id="pg-28-275" n="28:275"/>from Neuberg, only a few days ago; who had <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> him at Kiel, seen him eating bread and butter to his coffee, and been greatly delighted with him: unfortunately he does not <hi rend="italic">date</hi> the scene at Kiel, which is altogether joyful and comfortable in comparison; writes of it from the W&#xfc;rzburg region, merely as a thing past some time ago.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Marshall: I have still many things to do; and the inexorable clock-hands, hour and minute, are turning ever round. Last year, on such a day of sunny clearness and stillness, I was in Eisenach, looking on Luther&#x2019;s footprints in the Wartburg,&#x2014;<foreign>ach Gott</foreign>! But thank Heaven, I shall not be disturbed at night by dogs, asses, cocks and fatal creatures, nor have any <foreign><hi rend="italic">Keilkissen</hi></foreign> [wedge-shaped bolster] put below my head to sleep upon!&#x2014; Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<p>Nothing wrong here, my Dear; nor nothing very <hi rend="italic">right</hi>,&#x2014;especially as you say nothing of coming out! I have lived, and live, in the profoundest silence of La Trappe&#x2014;take long walks, midday and morning; have not slept to much perfection; have read a great deal for the time; and, this morning, caught a bit of a <hi rend="italic">stiff neck</hi>, which I hope wont develope itself into rheumatism. Margaret<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Addiscombe servant.</note> continues perfectly punctual, correct and attentive;&#x2014;but evidently cannot <hi rend="italic">make puddings</hi>, and evidently too is unwilling to try. Which, in the present diet I have here, is a considerable deficit to me, and surely a great loss of opportunities! A hint in Lady A.&#x2019;s Letter, (which came yesterday) in reference to the Farmer&#x2019;s wife, seems to me well worth attention, on this ground; and were <hi rend="italic">you</hi> here, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> set you on negociating the business.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your last Note found me here, whither I had run out for a little glimpse of solitude and fresh air, and where I still am, in the enjoyment of these blessings. The Book,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530904-TC-JOGL-01">TC to <sic>JG</sic><corr>JOGL</corr>, <date when="1853-09-04">4 Sept.</date></ref></note> as I learn, has arrived, safe and all right, at Chelsea; it will be a short time yet before I see it: therefore I will not delay this announcement; <pb id="pg-28-277" n="28:277"/>nor my thanks, and final congratulations on the good issue of our little joint adventure, which winds itself up in this handsome manner. I have not, for a long while, been so well satisfied with anything I engaged in. I will keep that Book among my valuables; it will awaken many kindly recollections, and none other than kindly, whenever I look upon it henceforth.

<p>I got safe home last night; safe, and found a fire, and kettle procurable, shortly after <hi rend="italic">ten</hi>. Tired enough; but <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> like a stone, and am all the better for the adventure.</p>
<p>Silence here, and a grey sky occasionally dropping: how different with my poor little wayworn Goody toiling amid the element of lime-dust and chaotic noise! I saw you wanted me to go last night; and the thought, &#x201C;How <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> in means is the <hi rend="italic">truest</hi> human affection,&#x2014;no richer, and yet so true, and deserving to be rich!&#x201C; was pathetic and beautiful to me under the dark skies!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I enclose you the Note for Newman;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably about F. W. Newman&#x2019;s Latin lectures at University College, starting <date when="1853-10-13">13 Oct.</date>; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530421-TC-WA-01">TC to WA, <date when="1853-04-21">21 April</date></ref>.</note> and shall sincerely wish you may get some good of it, and of the somewhat questionable enterprise you have in view. On that latter head I will say no more; having already perhaps said too much. I perceive you greatly exaggerate the advantages derivable from College Lectures in these times, and do not value at anything like its real amount the solid privilege of being economically independent, and left free to attend the &#x201C;Lectures&#x201C; you might give <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi> (on far better than <hi rend="italic">academical</hi> subjects) on such tolerable terms! No man can be <hi rend="italic">made</hi> wise, except by his own virtuous efforts; and, in these days of Books and Libraries, all the little help he can get from others is, as it were, brought to his own door, wherever he may live.</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I am grateful for a word from your hand again, tho&#x2019; the news is very sad. Till my Wife saw Henry<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rawlins.</note> the other day, I could not guess what had become of you, and ran into all sorts of bad conjectures. Alas, the inexorable Years, that cut away from us, one after another, the true souls whom we loved, who loved us truly: that is the real bitterness of life; against which there is no remedy, and natural tears must fall!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster&#x2019;s uncle John Forster, who was, said Forster, &#x201C;my best friend all through life,&#x201C; died in <date when="1853-08">Aug.</date>; a month later his sister Jane suddenly died of cholera (Davies, <hi rend="italic">John Forster</hi> 80).</note> But we ourselves, my friend, it is not long we have to stay behind; we too shall find a shelter in the Silent Kingdoms; and much Despicability that barked and snarled incessantly round us <hi rend="italic">here</hi> shall then be without the walls forevermore. &#x201C;Blessed are the Dead,&#x201C; I often silently say: &#x201C;if we had done our work, it were good for us to be dead too,&#x2014;and safe with all our loved ones round us, <hi rend="small-caps">there</hi>!&#x201C; God is great, say the Moslem; to which we add only, God is Good,&#x2014;and have not, nor ever shall have, any more to say.</p>
<p>Happily you are not <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> in respect of health you must take all pains (for really that is your great interest), and get better and better. I have no doubt, a <pb id="pg-28-280" n="28:280"/><hi rend="italic">thorough reform</hi> of regimen, upon which I hope you have determined, will do wonders for you. Literally wonders. It is a fact, I should not have lasted any one year of these last thirty on your terms; and, on my own, you see I am still struggling along! Attend to this, I very earnestly intreat you. We cannot do with our Forster in that sick state at all!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This is my third week of an almost perfect <hi rend="italic">Hermitism</hi> out here, such a life as I have rarely had experience of; for my Wife is mostly at Chelsea, and for days together I literally do not speak one word! I think it is to end on Saturday. Next week, drive down to Chelsea any day, you will probably find us both;&#x2014;or write (to my Wife), and <hi rend="italic">appoint</hi> some evening, with tea, either there or at L.I.F.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields.</note>&#x2014; <closer><salute>God bless you dear F.</salute></closer></p>

I have been up since 7 a.m.; and, except walking for an hour, have been lounging as in a Turkish Bath: ah me!</p>
<p>Your letter, with the Dumfries Paper, my only tidings this morning lay on the table; you I took out with me, and read as I walked. Poor little soul, heavyladen little Goody!

<p>I am coming home tomorrow; I will set no hour: it will be towards evening;&#x2014;and if I have got no dinner here (as is likely enough), never mind: I will take a bit of <hi rend="italic">bacon</hi> to my toast at tea, and all will be right on that side.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I heard nothing from you last week; and was sorry (tho&#x2019; not without hopes it may turn to good yet!) that you were detained by <hi rend="italic">sickness</hi> in your wayfaring household. Give my best regards to poor Phoebe; and bid her take all possible care of herself.</p>
<p>There came only a small Note from Mary in the shape of news from our poor Mother; from which I was thankful to learn in general that things were in their old frail way in <supplied>[that]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> quarter,&#x2014;nor decidedly <hi rend="italic">worse;</hi> and, alas, how can we much look for improvement! The sad thought attends one everywhere; the mournfullest and tenderest that has dwelt in my mind hitherto,&#x2014;and strangely contrasting with the haggard rubbish one is otherwise filled with to the lips in these bad days. Ah me, ah me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I staid at Addiscombe in perfect solitude (for Jane went home on Monday; I with her, but <hi rend="italic">returned</hi> that same night); and in a <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> equal to that of one born dumb: a curious 14 days or more I have had of it in that kind. Long walks, enormous reading, varied by tobacco at frequent intervals: one was peaceable, lonesome, pensive, mournful, as I suppose they are in the Elysian fields.&#x2014; I did not sleep well; and was as far from <hi rend="italic">joyful</hi> as possible: but I believe the thing did me good, both in body and mind. And indeed I am going to have a touch more of it before quite giving up: for yesternight on coming home (on foot, as has been my constant practice hitherto) to a &#x201C;bagman&#x2019;s tea&#x201C; (so-called), I found things still in such a whirl (tho&#x2019; now decidedly subsiding), that for another day or two I shall clearly be better away among the green trees again. Tomorrow morning therefore, after speaking to my Builder about many sorry points of &#x201C;business&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">sorry</hi> all of them to me, in my present humour), I am off again; and shall stay probably till Thursday, before I pack up my good<supplied>[s]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> and actually leave. Heigho!&#x2014; &#x2014; On monday last, and never till then, I got fairly in and <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> my &#x201C;new room&#x201C; (for they have done it all from <pb id="pg-28-282" n="28:282"/>the outside to the very last); a spacious kind of place, and very light; but sadly disappointing in one respect: it is of irregular shape in two of the walls, and in part two feet lower than I expected! But, it now clearly seems, the &#x201C;Surveyor,&#x201C; with his &#x201C;Building-Act,&#x201C; stood in the way; and it <hi rend="italic">could not</hi> be helped. Well, well!&#x2014; Poor Chorley was much chagrined to notice my disappointment, for he has been as active as a gnome in superintending, in pushing, and controuling: good soul, nobody <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be friendlier,&#x2014;and his temper has some elements not of fresh-butter in it! On the whole, however, the place looks better this new time I see it; and if it <hi rend="italic">be</hi> soundproof as the Chorley prediction confidently runs, certainly it will be a grand relief to me. Would I were at my work again, in <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, or in any cell or safe inverted-tub; really I am getting quite discomfitted at this rate.&#x2014; In the course of this week, I do expect the people will have got fairly off <hi rend="italic">our staircase</hi>, and capable of being locked into their own premises again; there they will do little ill; and may go on papering, painting &#x26;c for six weeks more if they like. Enough of them, and their most wretched affairs! Everybody is &#x201C;on strike&#x201C; just now, or going on it; that has been a great and unexpected delay to my clever little man.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother; do not forget to write me a little word, even tho&#x2019; you have not much to say. My dear old Mother never leaves my thoughts.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Sir,&#x2014;</salute>Since I saw you last year in Dresden, I have been reading a great many of your books; finding in them, as all the world does, abundant entertainment, and endless matter for reflexion. It is very surprising to me how you have contrived to amass such a quantity of floating information on things seldom formally recorded; and how correct it all is; at least how correct our British part of it is, which I naturally take as a sample of the whole. You do often name your authorities, which is a great satisfaction to every careful reader; if you had in all cases done so, it would among other advantages have saved you the trouble of this Note, which I had long had it in view to venture upon writing to you, containing the two following inquiries:&#x2014;</p>
<p>1. Can you tell me, in what book or books that account of George the First&#x2019;s Death is to be found,&#x2014;with all the tragic particulars between Velden<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Delden, a small town NNW of Arnhem, nr. the Dutch border in Hanover. For TC&#x2019;s account of George I&#x2019;s death and his sources, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:102&#x2013;4.</note> and Osnabr&#xfc;ck;&#x2014;and in general what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the chief book for the secret history of <pb id="pg-28-283" n="28:283"/>George the First?

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>On monday I had a note from the Doctor, which brought me the bad news that my poor Mother had grown worse after that state of sleepiness which you described; that he had been sent for, and that in fact she had been in an ill state, weak and suffering for two days or more. Alas, alas, the dear old Mother! She was better again, and essentially in her usual way, he said, at the time of his writing; he was to return to Edinburgh, and promised further prompt tidings, especially if he heard anything <hi rend="italic">bad</hi>. I have yet heard nothing; but I sit in fear of every post,&#x2014;in the pusillanimous weak humour I am in. The weather too is so bad, the very dark&#x2014;the sky (in these [word missing] <supplied>[d]</supplied>ays) upon my weak spirits. Never mind <hi rend="italic">me;</hi>&#x2014;yet write me a word of authentic intelligence as soon as convenient.</p>
<p>I got home from Addiscom<supplied>[be on]</supplied> Friday afternoon, as proposed. Jane has got a new and apparently much <hi rend="italic">better</hi> Servant, a London English one, in place of the fairspoken Irish <hi rend="italic">skilt</hi>, who was nothing but a cloud of <hi rend="italic">Lies</hi> and &#x201C;Hugger-mugger slightly varnished&#x201C;; whom I was not sorry to find fled,&#x2014;off, with one of the Irish labourers who had been at this job of ours; more power to their elbow! Poor Jane had got all things swept and cleaned: the Carpenters were already off our staircase; locked into their own room, which they reach by a ladder from without: they have now nearly <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> everything there, and in fact give us no disturbance at all; but &#x201C;the painting and papering,&#x201C;&#x2014;that still remains; and even cannot be done (at least the papering cannot) till spring come. So I shall not <hi rend="italic">get into</hi> my room this wi<supplied>[nte]</supplied>r; and in fact, I do not much mind; for the noises at any rate have now much faded away, and my <hi rend="italic">old</hi> h<supplied>[abitatio]</supplied>n is improved into new security in that respect: so that, at any rate, the Drawingroom (a really excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> apart<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, due to Jane and the toils of last year), where all my Books are, is a much better lodging till the cold weather go. If I could but get along with my &#x201C;work&#x201C;! Alas, alas, I try at it on all sides, and it will not stir from the spot; and I shall have a bra&#x2019; business with it yet, before it get fairly in motion! Wish me diligence; wish me <hi rend="italic">piety</hi>, patience,&#x2014;at any rate, the faculty of holding my tongue!</p>
<p>Last night we got a sad shock, by the evening Postman; which fell <hi rend="italic">heaviest</hi> <pb id="pg-28-286" n="28:286"/>by far on my poor Jane, and might as readily on me: the Death of her Uncle<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh.</note> at Auchtertoul! He seems to have grown ill on Sabbath last,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Wed.</note> being very weak and lame before; he grew rapidly worse; gave them all his blessing and farewell about 3 in the afternoon; and sank, after th<supplied>[at int]</supplied>o <supplied>[a]</supplied> kin<supplied>[d]</supplied> of sleep, which at 10 had deepened into death. Of course they are all in great distress, some of them in Liverpool, some on vis<supplied>[its e]</supplied>lsewhere: poor Helen writes without <hi rend="italic">dating</hi>. As to Jane here, she has <hi rend="italic">spoken</hi> little since; and is very sad and low indeed, poor soul; sitting down stairs, making up mournings I can see; refusing to go out anywhither. He was a good, brave, and honest and kindhearted man, this Uncle that is gone; the last of all her kindred too, in some measure: so that it is as if all old things had come up upon her again. What can we do? What can we do? Nothing,&#x2014;except, as it is said, &#x201C;kiss the rod&#x201C;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Two Gentlemen of Verona</hi> 1.2.</note> and confess that One is sovereign over us, and that His will is our law. Oh dear, Oh dear!</p>
<p>I will add no more today: it is towards 4 o&#x2019;clock, and my fire is out this long while; so that walking is doubly necessary.&#x2014;I do fancy, after all, I got some good of that depth of solitude in Surrey: I am in general <hi rend="italic">clearer;</hi> let us hope much <hi rend="italic">sediment</hi> has fallen. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Sister: I send my love to every one of you; my heart&#x2019;s blessing, as ever, to my dear old Mother in her frail state&#x2014; Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<p>I know not what I am going to say. I am quite stupified. I had somehow never taken alarm at my Uncles last illness.

<salute>Dear Clough,</salute>
<p>The Grand Duchess of Weimar is about setting up some Grand-Ducal Institute for educating the nobility and gentry of Weimar: there is to be a Frenchman to teach French; there is to be &#x26;c &#x26;c, and of course (upon which <pb id="pg-28-288" n="28:288"/>last point alone am I concerned) an <hi rend="italic">Englishman to teach English</hi>. The question is, Can you help me at all towards such a man,&#x2014;on the following outline of terms.</p>
<p>The salary is to be 600 Prussian Thalers, which I think is about &#xa3;90 Sterling, but which, according to the Weimar scale of markets, is calculated to be as good as &#xa3;100 in a similar English Town. If the Institute shall perfectly <hi rend="italic">succeed</hi>, the 600 may be raised, in the course of years, to 700 and even to 800 Thalers (about 3/ each);&#x2014;and in any case, the Grand-Duchess&#x2019;s Secretary (a clever little Scotchman, or Irish-Scotchman, of the name of Marshall, who is the applicant to me in this matter) computes that, by <hi rend="italic">private</hi> teaching of English in Weimar, our Englishman might earn annually 300 Thalers more. On the whole, &#xa3;150 annually seems to be about the income he might reckon on, supposing all to go in a <hi rend="italic">moderately</hi> prosperous manner.</p>
<p>They will take him, as it were, on <hi rend="italic">trial</hi> for a year or a year and half; after which the engagement to be permanent. A man perfect in <hi rend="italic">pronunciation</hi> is required; so that Glasgow and Edinburgh are cut out. Also a man &#x201C;without encumbrances&#x201C; (i.e. Wife, especially &#x201C;children or the prospect of children&#x201C;),&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">caeteris paribus</hi></foreign> [all things being equal]! The Teachers are all to be ready on this ground at Weimar, against Easter next.&#x2014; Other conditions, advantages or duties, there are none mentioned.</p>
<p>Of course an Oxford or Cambridge graduate, if otherwise qualified, would have the best <hi rend="italic">name</hi> of all. He ought, for the rest, to possess the qualities you can yourself imagine as well as I; among which a slight preliminary knowledge of German will of course be important. Weimar is a pleasant quiet little City, of 10,000, most rather idle and polite inhabitants; abounds, naturally, in <hi rend="italic">Goetheana</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Schilleriana</hi> and other such ware; has an extensive Ducal Library (little used, I should think), and does not want for means of <hi rend="italic">real</hi> as well as superficial and imaginery culture to a studious soul.&#x2014; The salary is smallish for England; but it is larger than that of many a young Curate; whom, if he had a taste for German things, it might suit very well for a few years.</p>
<p>I request you to keep this matter in your mind for 24 hours, diligently revolving it (as far as official duties will permit it), and then to say whether you can remember any likely person,&#x2014;or if perhaps you think there can none, of the kind alluded to, be found.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clough had seen TC, <date when="1853-10-09">9 Oct.</date>, when he wrote to Emerson: &#x201C;Carlyle has been in rural solitude, &#x2026; and he certainly seems much the better for it. I have not seen him in such good animal spirits for some time&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Clough</hi> 2:464).</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Maccall,</salute>
<p>I spoke to you incidentally, last time we met, about a young Scotchman, an Ex-Unitarian Minister in or near Portsmouth, who once called on me here, and whom you also had met; he is originally of the Aberdeen Region (I think); but his <hi rend="italic">Name</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Address</hi> I have entirely forgotten,&#x2014;and must now ask you to help me to, if you can.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly John MacRae Moir (<date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881">81</date>), educ. Aberdeen Univ., came to London, <date when="1846">1846</date>; journalist from <date when="1852">1852</date>; later Nonconformist minister, Worthing, Sussex; barrister, <date when="1864">1864</date>; wrote <hi rend="italic">Capital Punishment</hi> (<date when="1865">1865</date>), based on K. J. A. Mittermaier, <hi rend="italic">Todesstrafe</hi> (Heidelberg, <date when="1862">1862</date>); see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531015-TC-WM-01">TC to WM, <date when="1853-10-15">15 Oct.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>The business is this. A situation, Teacher of English in a certain new Grand-Ducal Institute at Weimar, is open; for which it seems to me possible, tho&#x2019; not by any means certain or perhaps even very probable, he might suit: at least I would inquire farther in reference to him and it. I am afraid he knows no German? Which is certainly a drawback. On the other hand, his <hi rend="italic">pronunciation</hi> and accent seemed to me tolerably English: and, what is very fundamentally important, he appeared to be a man, of good general instruction, and real sense and worth. Tell me what has become of him; and what you think of such a situation in reference to him. Or of course in reference to <hi rend="italic">any other</hi> that you may know; for I would fain get the Grand-Duchess the best man going,&#x2014;at the money!</p>
<p>Salary officially certain is about &#xa3;100,&#x2014;to which by <hi rend="italic">private</hi> teaching in Weimar, it is reckoned, &#xa3;50 more might be added. A quiet, <hi rend="italic">cheap</hi>, clean little City; with good Ducal library: the <hi rend="italic">headquarters</hi> for a student of German.&#x2014; Write me a word as soon as you can. <closer><salute>Yours always truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Next day after I last wrote to you, your Letter lay duly waiting me at Addiscombe (whither I had come out <hi rend="italic">walking</hi>): you may fancy it was a welcome sight, and a good seasoning to the <hi rend="italic">pipe</hi> I had earned by my fatigues!&#x2014; I staid at Addiscombe, according to program, quite alone, and very busy with books, till friday; then gathered my baggage, and did take myself away at last: to a Home, <hi rend="italic">swept</hi> up (thanks to poor Jane&#x2019;s industry), but far from quietude still, and alas, quite incapable of such quietude as I had been lately enjoying. &#x201C;Enjoying&#x201C; was hardly the word either, for one&#x2019;s mood of mind was the very reverse of <hi rend="italic">joy:</hi> but certainly such solitude was of the nature of rest, and assisted to shed the <hi rend="italic">sediment</hi> out of one&#x2019;s mind and body: accordingly I fancy I find myself perceptibly better ever since, tho&#x2019; of course daily coming towards the old low pitch again.</p>
<p>Next day after my return, your second Note came to me: it is the last news I yet have of our frail old Mother, and alas none of the best, tho&#x2019; not worse than we may naturally fear at any time. I have written to Jean for a word of intelligence; but I rely on your punctual engagement to write at once, especially if there is bad news,&#x2014;if any news come to you. And so we must be patient; and <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> as long as possible, in spite of all our fears.</p>
<p>You would of course hear that poor Mr Welsh was gone: the tidings came quite unexpectedly, as I think the event itself had <supplied>[d]</supplied>one:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> poor Jane is in a very disconsolate humour ever since; speaks little about it, or about anything; is silently getting mournings ready &#x26;c: sad enough to see.</p>
<p>Our new apartment is nearly clear of its carpenters for a week past: an Irish labourer is at present washing out the floor &#x26;c: but the papering or even painting is impossible owing to moist plaster; the place will certainly not be habitable till spring: much if I can occasionally smoke in it with comfort. For it is yet far from completely <hi rend="italic">deaf;</hi> and I foresee considerable higglings on many sides before it can be perfect. Chorley has, in silent pride, <hi rend="italic">withdrawn</hi>, I hardly know why; but certainly it is according to some strict rule of his own: a lean exact, hard man, full of sulphurous internal fire!&#x2014; &#x2014; I try to do a little at writing; but with very bad success: I do not think there is yet a line that will stick to the paper&#x2014;ah me, ah me!&#x2014; We are very glad indeed to hear Phoebe is better. <closer><salute>Good be with you all!

<p>I earnestly hope you may find some farther success in that <hi rend="italic">latest</hi> kind of Lecturing; that is evidently a much likelier field than Authorship</p>

<salute>Dear Landor,</salute>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Hume</hi> arrived, last night, in perfect safety: an excellent Portrait, in a fine light suitable frame; warmly recognized by all parties here as a magnanimous and altogether welcome Gift. The Female genius has already schemed out for it a place of honour among the <hi rend="italic">Lares</hi> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Penates</hi></foreign> [household gods] of this house; and, in the meanwhile, it stands upon a sofa in the room where I am; pleasantly reminding me of many things old and new. Many thanks to you indeed, and may your shadow never be less!</p>
<p>Forster happened to be here, after long absence, when the Picture came; and we had abundant canvassing of it, and rejoicing over in our way. If not by Ramsay (tho&#x2019; why should it not), it is evidently by some skilful artist; and speaks itself a good likeness. Curious to see by what slight circumstance the face is relieved from being that of a common fat Scotch Laird, one of the thousand &#x201C;Humes of Ninewells&#x201C;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ninewells House, the Hume family home, &#xBD; mi. SW of the village of Chirnside in Berwickshire.</note> and yet relieved it is, and stands there as the evident face of a fat Stoic and Sceptic, with great stores of bottled-up reflexion, and emotion which it was better not to produce in the bad weather then prevalent.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Charlemont described Hume&#x2019;s appearance more critically: &#x201C;Nature, I believe, never formed any man more unlike his real character. &#x2026; His face was broad and fat, his mouth wide, and without any other expression than that of imbecility. His eyes vacant and spiritless, and the corpulence of his whole person was far better to communicate the idea of a turtle-eating Alderman, than of a refined philosopher&#x201C; (F. Hardy, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of &#x2026; James Caulfield, Earl of Charlemont</hi> [<date when="1812">1812</date>] 1:15).</note> I own to a very considerable respect for the solid cheery slow-going man: Jeffrey used to tell me, there were still old Ladies extant in Edinburgh, in his time, who could become enthusiastic in their praises of the excellent &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Dawvid</hi>,&#x201C; in spite of his formidable heterodoxies. God is great!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I know not where, or whether ever again, I am to be in the Bath region: but I straitly charge you not to miss us when you are next in London. <closer><salute>My Wife adds many regards; joins her thanks with mine.

<salute>Dear Sir James,</salute>
<p>You are infinitely gentle, polite, and considerate, with your fellow creature;&#x2014;and I altogether retract that unguarded phrase of mine; which indeed I had forgotten so soon as uttered; and which you now must do me the kindness to forget.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stephen wrote TC, <date when="1853-10-15">15 Oct.</date>, from 29 Westbourne Terr.: &#x201C;When we parted the other day &#x2026; , you dropped half a dozen words, which &#x2026; have left a deep impression on my own mind. &#x2026; / I am, however, unable to quote the <foreign><hi rend="italic">ipsissima verba</hi></foreign> [exact words] to which I refer. The substance alone remains with me. To your remark that the Church of England was nothing else than a vast machinery for maintaining religious decorums, I had answered in effect that I knew many, &#x26; worshipped in public with many, to whom as far as I could judge it was a reality; and that though the pews were filled with crowds of comfortable-looking folks who called themselves &#x2018;miserable sinners,&#x2019; yet that &#x2026; the congregations which I usually frequent seemed to me to be at least sincere in their use of the Anglican liturgy, though it was a sincerity that did not lead them to any great depth or elevation of piety &#x2026; . <supplied>[Y]</supplied>our reply to it was &#x2026; to the following effect, &#x2018;Well, I believe that after all you think on these subjects as I do.&#x2019; &#x2026; / It seems to me that I should be a coward &#x26; a knave if I did anything to cherish that belief in you, or if I did not do what I can to remove it.&#x201C;</note> It is certain I never could have meant more by it than that you agreed with me in recognising the divine and awful meaning of real religion, and the horrible condition into which that highest interest is reduced among us at present; that the <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> of your &#x201C;religion&#x201C; was analagous to the <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> of mine, however much their respective <hi rend="italic">embodiments</hi> might differ.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stephen said that he believed &#x201C;the Bible, or rather the greater part of it is in some real though undefinable sense the word of God&#x201C; and that &#x201C;between the life &#x26; death of Jesus Christ &#x26; our own reconciliation to God there is an indispensable though (I confess) a perfectly inexplicable relation&#x2014;the persuasion that there is a Divine Presence to be invoked by prayer, to be repelled by sensuality, &#x26; to be restored to the heart by repentance &#x26; amendment&#x2014;the persuasion of a real though wholly incomprehensible intimacy (approaching almost to unity) of life &#x26; being &#x26; nature between parents &#x26; their children, &#x26; their more remote posterity&#x2014;the persuasion thence resulting of an ancestral corruption of our whole race&#x2014;&#x26; the persuasion that by the adoption of our nature Jesus Christ has broken the otherwise indissoluble bonds which link us all to sin &#x26; to sorrow the child of sin. / &#x2026; . My convictions are &#x2026; less strong than my persuasions. &#x2026; / But yet I &#x2026; tell you as distinctly as I can that however remote I may be from the character of a Christian, I am bound by links stronger than death to Him from whom that holy name is derived &#x2026; &#x2014;that if you are really a dissentient from the Christian faith, I at least can give no support or countenance to that dissent.&#x201C;</note> <pb id="pg-28-294" n="28:294"/>This is all I could have meant, or shall ever presume to mean on such a matter. And so again I say, Have the goodness to expunge the phrase and let it not stand upon the record at all.</p>
<p>You will find nothing of theological in that <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi>, that I know of;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stephen said: &#x201C;What your theological tenets may be, I do not &#x2026; presume to enquire. I am told that they are more clearly expressed in your Life of Sterling, than in any other of your works. But it &#x2026; is almost the only part of your writings with which I am not acquainted. I am also told that in that book you announce yourself as dissentient from the Christian Creed even in those articles of it which are accepted if not universally, at least generally, among the Churches into which Christendom is divided; or more briefly in those articles which are brought together in what is called the Apostles&#x2019; Creed.&#x201C;</note> only an emphatic assertion here and there (too emphatic such conviction can hardly be, tho&#x2019; I own the assertion of it may be inconveniently so) that a man ought not to do Playactorisms before high Heaven, nor preach what he does not himself completely believe:&#x2014;nor in fact, I grieve to say, will that poor rag of a Book (which was a votive offering rather than a bit of Literature) repay your perusal under any point of view,&#x2014;except at a very idle time indeed! My &#x201C;religious creed&#x201C; is not stated there; nor, as you say, would it be easy to state;&#x2014;and you must farther do me the justice to believe that it is not <hi rend="italic">skepsis</hi>, or doubt, any more, for these last 30 years; but a <hi rend="italic">certainty</hi> with me, for which I also am and ought to be forever thankful to the Maker of me.</p>
<p>And so we will not awaken &#x201C;sleeping dog kennels&#x201C; (whatever our friend the Archdeacon<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably J. C. Hare.</note> may advise); but will, if you please, meet soon again for another long walk <foreign><hi rend="italic">sub dio</hi></foreign> [under the open skies], or long talk within four walls in a sitting posture; and indeed if you do not, about the end of the week, come down to us here, I design to go up to you yonder,&#x2014;upon the principle of Mahomet&#x2019;s miracle,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >When the Prophet ordered Mount Safa to come to him, and it did not move, he went to it.</note> the only sound principle in these cases!&#x2014;<closer><salute>I can with great truth subscribe myself always,</salute></closer></p>

You are very good in sending me news; [page torn] they are a great favour to me at present! A little word [page torn] any wild apprehensions at times: and it is often true,&#x2014;fact is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so bad as one&#x2019;s sorrowful imagination of it. My poor weak Mother seems not to be <hi rend="italic">worse;</hi> and right thankful am I to hear even so much. She is always loving to me, also, how [page torn] the good old Mother! One has to thank [page torn]; and for such a Mother, still spared to one, as one of the chief.</p>
<p>All is wet confusion here: such wet weather as I seldom saw; and a remnant of Carpenters and painters still pottering about,&#x2014;it will be long before we are <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> cleared of them, and certain that no foreign foot will interrupt our quiet again. They will soon go <hi rend="italic">till Spring</hi>, however; and indeed, have then only a few days of business with us. And if my new room (which has still some imperfections, but <hi rend="italic">promises</hi> really well) do answer its purpose, it wi<supplied>[ll be an]</supplied> acquisition to me for the rest of my life.&#x2014; [page torn] have got what seems to be an excellent <supplied>[servant]</supplied> the best that has been here for many a year: which is a very great point in our small domesticities.</p>
<p>I am well enou<supplied>[gh i]</supplied>n health; really, I often think, in spite of all these confu<supplied>[sions]</supplied> [page torn] my average, by dint merely of <hi rend="italic">sitting still</hi><supplied>[.]</supplied> Poor Jane is unluckily not so well; got a disagreeable cold, some days ago, and is obliged to keep the house; very feckless;&#x2014;but for these last two days, is decidedly getting better; and will be out for a little walk, the first glimpse of sun we have.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Aai, ai, ai!&#x2014; &#x2014; &#x2014; Here has my little Builder been, to consult, <hi rend="italic">consult</hi>, about that sorrowful room; and has taken all my time away from me, and hardly left room for the [page torn] Hoohoo!&#x2014; &#x2014; Another word shall come directly; <hi rend="italic">this</hi> <supplied>[week]</supplied>end.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, if Jane can, she will write to Isabella her ideas about the butter and meal: <hi rend="italic">I</hi> rather think, <hi rend="italic">no meal or very little;</hi>&#x2014;a stone or so of the old is still left; we can get n[page torn]-time, without an effort (Jane making it herself), and hav<supplied>[e]</supplied> almost given it up. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> will say precisely; or if not she, I.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Garthwaite is to make me three pairs of flannel drawers,&#x2014;stuff, size &#x26;c <hi rend="italic">the very same</hi> as the last (5 pairs) he made me. Let him be at once instructed and set to work.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And therewith, we end for today;&#x2014;sending love and affection to our dear Mother to you and to ev<supplied>[ery]</supplied>one.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Ever yours, Dear Jean,</salute></closer>

<p><salute>Dear Sir,&#x2014;</salute>After your generous procedure, you may believe me I am quite unwilling to trouble you further on the subject of our late correspondence. But it is perhaps proper for me to certify, in case it should not be already known, that Mr. Martin Senior&#x2019;s remonstrance with his tenant here, which I accept as a mark of extreme kindness to me, has for the present produced no good effect, but the reverse.</p>
<p>Before that most obliging interference some of my people (by aid of a sovereign, half-paid, half-promised for the year) had bargained with some of this man&#x2019;s, that the noisy part of his livestock should be kept within doors till the hours of sleep were passed, a promise which had been in part observed till then, and the observance of which, tho&#x2019; imperfect, was a considerable relief to us. But now, ever since his rebuke, the poor man&#x2019;s self-will has been set on fire, his promise, he, like a proud Napoleon of the Washingtub indignantly revokes; his cocks crow at discretion, his etc., etc.&#x2014;and the results are quite other than friendly on our side of the wall!</p>
<p>Forgive me for troubling you with this poor fact and suffer me to add the corollary to it. If this poor man&#x2014;to whom I should regret extremely to do the least injury, for I believe him to be really an industrious, harmless creature, and his angry obstinacy against me in this matter is not inhuman, but only blind and utterly ignorant&#x2014;if I say, he is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yet legally warned to quit Mr. Martin&#x2019;s premises at the next term, then I would respectfully propose that your Father&#x2019;s Agent should (instead of warning) endeavour to ascertain from him what the complete annual value of his poultry is to him, how much abatement of rent he would require for altogether giving up poultry and macaws, etc. Money was never paid more readily than I will pay this sum for immediate deliverance; certainly money, by me, was never paid which brought in such a return of value, tenfold and hundredfold!</p>
<p>This, dear Sir, is all I had to say, this, in case the man is not already warned to quit; if he is warned, I had not sent this&#x2014;but must beg your excuses and send it! One way or other this bad business, I perceive, will be got ended before long. I am now building (near finishing) on the best architectural advice, a certain new apartment or top story here, which, if it succeed, will completely or very much defend me against this poor man&#x2019;s noises after spring next! Thus, will assurance (we hope) be doubly sure! If you ever come to Town and dare venture westward so far, I should like very well to thank you <pb id="pg-28-297" n="28:297"/>personally for your great kindness: and have a laugh with you over the departure (expected speedy departure) of those winged miseries, value 3/6 each!</p>
<closer><salute>Believe me, Dear Sir, yours very sincerely,</salute></closer>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I got your two Notes, in due succession, the second of them yesterday morning; I am greatly indebted for your punctuality in writing about my Mother: it is the best comfort I can get at present, to know exactly how she is; for generally one&#x2019;s imagination is [page torn; <supplied>be</supplied>]low the reality, poor as that is. My dear old Mother: it is a great blessing to us all that she has you to watch over her in her sad infirmities.</p>
<p>We have had the worst weather here too; drenching ra<supplied>[in]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">muddy</hi> skies, and loud winds,&#x2014;what a terrible business that [page torn] on the Isle of Barra (Western Isles of Scotland) was: 400 people tumbled into the wild waves at once!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Annie Jane</hi>, sailing for Quebec, was lost on <date when="1853-09-28">28 Sept.</date> off Barra Head, when 348 passengers drowned and 102 survived.</note> Within a week past, the skies here dried, and the streets got clean aga<supplied>[in,]</supplied> the last two days we have had beautiful weather, sun out and temperature quite warm for the season. Jane&#x2019;s cold is quite abated within the <hi rend="italic">confinement</hi> pitch; some of it in her head yet, she says; but she goes about as if it were not there. I am myself well, what I call <hi rend="italic">well;</hi> tho&#x2019; a little ill off with stomach, with sleep &#x26;c, perhaps a degree more than usual. But I am stout for walking; get up early some mornings, when sleep is denied; and stride off a long walk into the lanes and suburbs, before any breakfast can be thought of. The miles on miles of new streets &#x26;c one sees everywhere laid out and begun, are perfectly <hi rend="italic">frightful</hi> <supplied>[in]</supplied> extent: nobody can guess what London is growing to in <supplied>[page torn]</supplied>ess of years; and to me, under present circumstances, it is not joyful to look upon. All the &#x201C;business&#x201C; of the world is getting to be done here. And the new <hi rend="italic">people</hi> that come to inhabit with [page torn]ly English or British,&#x2014;not even Irish, tho&#x2019; of these [page torn; <supplied>v</supplied>]isible shoals since the potatoe-time;&#x2014;but the main accessions, at least hereabouts, seem to me to be French, German, <hi rend="italic">Judean:</hi> all the hungry vultures of the Earth seem to have given themselves rendezvous here; and I often say to myself, &#x201C;Is <pb id="pg-28-298" n="28:298"/>this what you call <hi rend="italic">unexampled prosperity?</hi> This assembling of all the hungry uglinesses of creation? How w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> a little <hi rend="italic">adversity</hi> do, in comparison, and all those Jews sent <hi rend="italic">back</hi> to Palestine!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; But things will go their own course; at least, it is none of me that can sto<supplied>[p them;]</supplied> let them go.</p>
<p>I have no letter covers at all today, but these three wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I send you,&#x2014;not of the size or sort to be recommended. A 12 stamps are with them. I will send you more and better if you ask again.&#x2014; The two <hi rend="italic">Addresses</hi> are also sent: I wonder if Garthwaite could make me (besides the <hi rend="italic">drawers</hi>) a pair of trowsers, stuff somewhat like the clipping here inclosed; if he <hi rend="italic">dare</hi>, let him do so; then the Packages may come when they like. This is all [page torn] cut short when I sat down to write (for the [page torn] is yet far from <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> done); and today also I have not the <supplied>[least]</supplied> composure or time left.&#x2014; &#x2014; Oh be good and gentle and kind and patient to my dear old mother, and support her weakness as you can: she never grudged herself when one of us was ailing! <closer><salute>Blessings on her and you all. I will write soon again.&#x2014; Yours ever,&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your monogram is very pretty, and your intention towards me is very kind: accept many thanks from me for your goodness.</p>
<p>I have long been in want of some small Bookplate, and am always occasionally thinking of getting one engraved. But the kind suitable to me would be very different from this tasteful and somewhat abstruse one of yours: I should require the most evident <hi rend="italic">utility</hi> and <hi rend="italic">clearness</hi> (i.e. legibility) as ground work of the whole;&#x2014;plain name and surname, therefore, with a &#x201C;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>&#x201C; (to be filled up with the pen) in some convenient corner,&#x2014;perhaps one&#x2019;s poor <hi rend="italic">crest</hi> superadded:&#x2014;this is what I vaguely image to myself: but in fact I am totally ignorant in such matters; and know only, in this as in other things, that the <hi rend="italic">honestly useful</hi> is never ugly, and that the &#x201C;beautiful&#x201C; which cannot be used is very apt to be so in my eyes.&#x2014; Perhaps as you grow older, you will yourself more and more come into <hi rend="italic">this</hi> now almost forgotten &#x201C;doctrine of the beautiful,&#x201C;&#x2014;at least if you persist in your love of Oliver Cromwell, whose whole existence is a most memorable, grand and heroic preaching forth of the same.</p>
<p><closer><salute><pb id="pg-28-299" n="28:299"/>I will ask you to retain your kind feelings to me, in spite of contradictions; and with many thanks and regards, will remain</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>I have had a little worry which nature prompts me to communicate to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, as the best way to get it off my mind. The day before yesterday Pen Sketchly called. &#x201C;Bless me, she said, are you ill? I am sorry to see you look so <hi rend="italic">low</hi>.&#x201C; Yes I have been ten days confined with a cold. &#x201C;Oh&#x2014;really&#x2014;well I am come on what you will think an odd errand&#x2014;(with a coarse laugh)&#x2014;I want you to lend my mother five pounds,&#x201C; I will pay you again&#x2014;in two or three weeks&#x2014;when I get the price of some of my pictures.&#x201C; Now you must know I have long had a notion that the Sketchleys live on in that expensive house in the enjoyment apparently of all material good things just by dint of a hard face and borrowing,&#x2014;and what is equivalent to begging,&#x2014;forcing these wretched &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">pictures</hi>&#x201C; on people from right to left. So I had contemplated the possibility of some such application to myself, and predetermined to meet it with an equally <hi rend="italic">hard face</hi>, and refuse&#x2014; They live in a house at 15&#xa3; a year more rent than ours&#x2014;they have always little luxuries&#x2014;cakes, fruit, wine &#x26;c &#x26;c about them which for years of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> life here, I never ventured on&#x2014;and I did not see why I should go without a necessary gown, or bonnet, or both, to <hi rend="italic">lend</hi> that is to say give <hi rend="italic">them</hi> 5&#xa3;&#x2014; I have no doubt Pen thought I would at once give her 10&#xa3; as price of that odious picture she compelled me to sit for,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520723-JWC-TC-01"><sic>27:180</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1852-07-23">23 July 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> and which I had such difficulty in getting rid of. When she saw I did not at once jump to this, she said <hi rend="italic">bullyingly</hi> &#x201C;why you dont mean to say you havn&#x2019;t got it?&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Indeed I do&#x201C;&#x2014;I said (and it was a truth I had not 5&#xa3; of my own hardly 5s left)&#x2014;&#x201C;I have just spent all my own allowance on the mourning I needed&#x2014;and I could not lend you the money without asking it from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle,&#x201C; and&#x2014;&#x201C;Well <hi rend="italic">ask</hi> him!&#x2014;there&#x2019;s a Dear!&#x2014;go and ask him&#x2014;our Landlord will come for his rent tomorrow and we shall only have a few shillings left&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;But,&#x201C; said I gathering boldness from <hi rend="italic">her</hi> boldness&#x2014;&#x201C;If you are in such a hurry its no use asking M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C <hi rend="italic">even if I could bring myself to ask him</hi>&#x2014;his money lies in the bank in Dumfries, and a week always passes before we can get it here&#x2014;so you had better think of some one who <hi rend="italic">could</hi> lend it you at once&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Humph&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is unlucky that makes a difference&#x2014;I really dont know anybody but yourself <pb id="pg-28-300" n="28:300"/>to get it from.&#x201C; However she went off into speaking about the shabbiness of people who kept her waiting for the price of her pictures; and I advising her to ask for the money that was <hi rend="italic">her own</hi>&#x2014;after a time I took out my purse and showing her a sovereign and some silver I said&#x2014;There&#x2014;if you care to take this one sovereign just to put you over the immediate difficulty; but it is so little I am ashamed to offer it&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh, no&#x2014;never mind&#x2014;I wont embarress<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> you since you havnt got it.&#x201C; And she staid half an hour talking with apparent interest about capt Sterling and indifferent matters. I am sure I felt more at refusing her than she at being refused and the notion of having behaved shabbily has worried me ever since. And yet I know I did right to refuse&#x2014;especially when I <hi rend="italic">hadn&#x2019;t</hi> the money of my own&#x2014;I wonder if she thought of writing off to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, she asked me coarsely &#x201C;how much money has M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Welsh left?&#x2014; He was immensely rich we always understood&#x2014; Your cousins will be fortunes wont they.&#x201C; I hope my cousins will always be able <hi rend="italic">to live independently;</hi> I said with severity&#x2014;for I was disgusted to the last degree at the ideas of this woman But <hi rend="italic">I</hi> never understood my Uncle had any exorbitant wealth. He was <hi rend="italic">too honourable in paying up his old debts</hi> and too generous to every one for making &#x201C;immensely rich&#x201C;&#x2014; Finally she went away. and I hope she wont come back&#x2014;I have not told you the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> thing she said it was too indelicate for repetition even&#x2014; I think you ought to know what is in their hearts in case of their troubling you for money From Pen&#x2019;s manner of proceeding yesterday I havn&#x2019;t a doubt that she lives by <hi rend="italic">raising</hi> the wind from one year to another&#x2014; Still I feel put in <hi rend="italic">a false position</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Napoleon&#x2019;s phrase; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350601-TC-JSM-01"><sic>8:127</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1835-06-01">1 June 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> by her assault on <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I saw, last week, at Puttick the Auctioneer&#x2019;s in Piccadilly, a Cromwell Letter new to me;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The auctioneers, Puttick &#x26; Simpson, 191 Piccadilly, auctioned a collection of MSS., Fri., <date when="1853-10-28">28 Oct.</date>, including two original letters of Oliver Cromwell and one of Richard Cromwell (advert., <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1853-10-22">22 Oct.</date>). The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1853-11-05">5 Nov.</date>, reported that some Cromwell letters fetched high prices: &#x201C;One to the Protector&#x2019;s son Richard, dated Carrick, <date when="1650-04-02">April 2, 1650</date>&#x2014;a fine homely letter&#x2014;was knocked down for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.6<hi rend="italic">s;</hi>&#x201C; see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi>, 7:161&#x2013;62.</note> of which here inclosed is a Copy in Mr Puttick&#x2019;s hand,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Fell Puttick (ca. <date when="1821">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873">73</date>), auctioneer.</note> for your use if you will accept it.

<p>My chief reason for troubling you on this matter is also indicated on the Copy: a doubt concerning the &#x201C;Dr Richard <hi rend="small-caps">stand</hi>&#x201C; at Ely;&#x2014;whom I guess rather to be <hi rend="small-caps">hand</hi> (a name already known to us at Ely, <hi rend="italic">Letters and Speeches</hi>, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, iv, 409,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi>, 9:211, where Cromwell&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1638-09-13">13 Sept. 1638</date> to John Hand, collector of revenues for the town of Ely, is printed from a published source &#x201C;and is now (<date when="1846">1846</date>) none knows where.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;and in some <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi>. which I think you have): it is possible this &#x201C;Doctor&#x201C; may be a brother of that &#x201C;Mr.,&#x201C;&#x2014;or perhaps even may be the same man more formally addressed?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 9:267&#x2013;68, appendix 33, where Cromwell&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1651-12-15">15 Dec. 1651</date> to &#x201C;my dear Sister Mrs. Elizabeth Cromwell, at Doctor Richard Stand his house at Ely&#x201C; is printed and &#x201C;Stand&#x201C; queried as &#x201C;not <hi rend="italic">Hand?</hi>&#x201C; In Supplement No. 6 to his edn. of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, 3 vols.

<salute>My dear good Mother,</salute>
<p>I got John&#x2019;s Letter yesterday morning; and along with it Jane got Isabella&#x2019;s: we were very grateful for the news such as they were: we have reason always to say, How much <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> might it have been. Oh my dear old Mother, I cannot help you at all, under your heavy burden with your weak strength: I can only think of you continually with sadness and affection; and pray from my heart that a <hi rend="italic">blessing</hi> may lie in all these afflictions to us all. Then will our gain be exceeding great!&#x2014;&#x2014; I am kept in a very fretted uncomfortable mood myself for the last week: a carpenter is here, more than one; rectifications &#x26;c in that unfortunate room;&#x2014;and it cuts me out of any chance for serious work, as well as curtails my sleep, and <hi rend="italic">scratches</hi> me in various ways. We must have patience, as I have heard you say; we must call on patience, &#x201C;Patience come here and help me!&#x201C;&#x2014;there is no other resource for the moment.</p>
<p>Jane has got about well of her cold; is gone out this day, and was out yesterday; the weather being quite bright, tho&#x2019; fresh and coldish; very greatly improved from what it lately was. Things are <hi rend="italic">rising</hi>, in all shops, to a great rate;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1853-09-27">27 Sept.</date>, reported that wheat flour was 40 percent dearer than <date when="1852-09">Sept. 1852</date>, and that beef and mutton were also dearer.</note> the working people will not have so much to spend on <hi rend="italic">gin:</hi> that will be the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> result of it, and not a bad one that!</p>
<p>Last night the Sir James Stephen, whom I have sometimes told you of, came down to us: a serious, well-informed, <hi rend="italic">religious</hi> kind of man; a strange character for one who has been <hi rend="italic">in Office</hi> in these days. He seems to like <pb id="pg-28-303" n="28:303"/>talking with us; and to me a little of his conversation is not disagreeable now and then. We in general have little or no company of any kind (at least I have not), and are very quiet about this season of the year.&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;Here has just been a little cheery fiddle-diddle of a lady, Mrs Fraser whom you have heard John talk of; not finding Jane at home, she summoned <hi rend="italic">me</hi> down and (from the new servant) got me, little to my joy for the moment! However, she is a good little <hi rend="italic">jennyspinner</hi> of a body; and I am glad to have seen her again. Her Husband, the worthless soul, is now in Australia, she tells me; and nobody has the least account of him, or ever wishes or expects to have; he may be supposed to have gone to the Gold Diggings; a very fit place for him.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. William Fraser, b. Vivian; separated from William Fraser, formerly a lawyer and ed. of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review and Continental Miscellany;</hi> he had brought a case against William Bagley, accusing his wife of adultery, in <date when="1844">1844</date> (see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440221-TC-JC-01"><sic>17:280</sic><corr>TC to JC, <date when="1844-02-21">21 Feb. 1844</date></corr></ref>; date of death incorrect); in <date when="1852">1852</date> he was said to have been &#x201C;dying&#x201C; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520930-JWC-JAC-01"><sic>27:309</sic><corr>JWC to JAC, <date when="1852-09-30">30 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>We expect the Package of Butter &#x26;c in a few days; I will then, naturally, write a word to somebody.</p>
<p>I inclose a Cover for Mary; and hope she will send me a small notice of your goings on some day before Saturday,&#x2014;or at least not <hi rend="italic">on</hi> Saturday, as that is a day without post for London.</p>
<p>I hear Jane come in,&#x2014;just after her visitor is off my hands: I have still to do all my walking; and it now near 4 o&#x2019;clock, time I were begun with it.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Good b&#x2019;ye dear Mother. Mary, I know, will do all she can for you with her practical industry and assiduity: alas, it is little we can any of us do,&#x2014;and I, as it were, nothing except <hi rend="italic">wish</hi>.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>This Letter of Eckermann&#x2019;s, under a cover with my address, and no explanation, arrived yesterday: and indeed I perceive, it was meant in an oblique manner that I chiefly should see the Document.&#x2014;&#x2014; I wrote to Marshall instantly that I could not beg for a man with &#xa3;75 a-year in so cheap a place as Weimar. Before <hi rend="italic">you</hi> answer poor Eckermann, we shall have some talk about it,&#x2014;if indeed you answer him at all. Poor helpless soul!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are at home so far as I know every evening this week; tea at 7&#x2014;suppose you come tomorrow at that hour, to give us a little of your news.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours always truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>P.S. It seems there is an American Gentlewoman a <hi rend="italic">Miss Delia Bacon</hi> (who believes that Shakspeare, the man, is a mere <hi rend="italic">myth;</hi> otherwise a very good <pb id="pg-28-304" n="28:304"/>&#x26; reasonable woman) coming on <hi rend="italic">friday night;</hi> do you come that night, if you can.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>A thousand thanks for the little word of news you sent: had you <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been good, you might have left us guessing; groping in the dark regions of imagination, where for me at least, there is seldom much good to be discovered! When I know that you are well, and not oblivious of the absent, it is a great comfort to me and an indispensable. If I know farther where you are, and can scheme out for myself in some approximate manner what you are about, I have to say, Be content, sir; it is all you have a right to, all you will get at any rate!&#x2014; May the sun shine bright on you, and the great serenity be kind and joyful to you, you bright woman, related to joy.</p>
<p>Here all is as dark as when you left it: carpenters still occasionally in the house; sick nerves in it, peace enough for these but seldom; and no work, not a vestige of real <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, yet capable of being got done: you have thus the agre<supplied>[e]</supplied>able view of a man beaten upon, kicked and pumped upon by all Insolent Destinies of this strong but blind and dark world;&#x2014;a man needing patience, now and then, really very much. Alas, one never has enough of that, never quite <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>,&#x2014;or one could defy the most insolent Destinies to do one any real hurt or degradation, and snap one&#x2019;s fingers in their face, however gorgonlike they were. On the whole, I will not give in; I do not mean to give in, if I can help it.</p>
<p>Yesterday and one day before,&#x2014;driven out by chimney-sweeps, by carpets &#x26;c,&#x2014;I went to the Museum, and the <hi rend="italic">Vultur Ajutans&#x2019;s</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helping vulture; letter omitted; i.e., Panizzi. Lord Clarendon had written to Panizzi, <date when="1853-08-09">9 Aug.</date>, that Lady Ashburton &#x201C;believes that if <hi rend="italic">properly asked</hi> you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> allow him [TC] to take his books into some private room during the legal hours for study&#x201C; (MS: BL Add. MS 49596). TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1853-08-17">17 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Panizzi (an ugly bursten Modenese in the Museum, whom I do not love, and who returns the feeling) <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not, tho&#x2019; solicited from various quarters, high quarters some of them, admit me to the silent rooms of the King&#x2019;s Library,&#x2014;to a place where I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> read and enquire. Never mind; no matter at all: perhaps it is even better so. I believe I could explode the poor monster (who dines among the quality, and has a certain worth of humour and stomach, but is a poor blown-up pedant, and ill-placed where he is), if I took to petitioning, writing in the Times &#x26;c &#x26;c: but I shall take good heed of that! Intrinsically <hi rend="italic">he</hi> hinders me but little: intrinsically the blame is not on <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, but on the prurient darkness, and confused pedantry, and ostentatious inanity of the world which put him there, and which (I must own) he very fairly represents and symbolizes there. Lords Lansdowne and Brougham put Panizzi in, and the world (with its Hansards and Ballot-boxes and sublime apparatus) put in Lords Lansdowne and Brougham. A saddish time Mr. Rigmarole;&#x2014;yes, but what then?&#x2014;&#x201C;</note> Den: noisy, dirty as <pb id="pg-28-305" n="28:305"/>ever; I got little there,&#x2014;my usual headache and heartache, visible enough, but not very much else that was visible. Poor fat <hi rend="italic">Adjutans</hi>,&#x2014;he hindered me, too, from writing to you yesterday:&#x2014;that also is among his sins, or misfortunes; but we must forgive him, he knows not what he does!</p>
<p>Clough wrote me the enclosed Note today: I think I told you, a Weimar man had been got, far beyond any of Clough&#x2019;s in probable quality.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Wilson; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531211-TC-JMA-01">TC to <sic>JM</sic><corr>JMA</corr>, <date when="1853-12-11">11 Dec.</date></ref></note> I fancy Cl. will miss The Grange this time, and have to be content with his Nightingales,&#x2014; Philomels pouring their sad strain.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clough&#x2019;s fianc&#xE9;e, Blanche Smith (<date when="1828">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1904">1904</date>), was niece of William Edward (<date when="1794">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874">1874</date>) and Frances Nightingale of Lea Hurst, Derbyshire, and Embley Park, Hampshire, the parents of Florence Nightingale (<date when="1820">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1910">1910</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35241"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), reformer of hospital nursing, with whom and whose work Clough was to be closely associated and who had been his ally in his courtship of Blanche Smith. TC had met W. E. Nightingale in <date when="1851-04">April 1851</date>; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510412-TC-MAC-01"><sic>26:59</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1851-04-12">12 April 1851</date></corr></ref>. In Greek mythology Philomela&#x2019;s tongue was cut out so that she could not tell she had been raped by her brother-in-law. She was eventually changed into a nightingale. Clough spent part of Christmas at the Grange and part with the Nightingales.</note></p>
<p>I have seen nobody, or worse than none. One evening Sir Ja<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Stephen came; told us of Maurice what we already knew, that he was unanimously voted out;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >F. D. Maurice&#x2019;s dismissal from King&#x2019;s College by conservative churchmen was ostensibly because the view, expressed in <hi rend="italic">Theological Essays</hi> (Cambridge, <date when="1853">1853</date>) (especially in the last essay &#x201C;Eternal Life and Eternal Damnation&#x201C;), that eternal damnation was inconsistent with Christian love, would unsettle the students. The Church of England weekly <hi rend="italic">Record</hi>, <date when="1853-07-25">25 July</date>, wrote in condemning the essay: &#x201C;The amiable and eccentric Professor has continued to jumble together a strange compound of doctrine, in which the Rationalism of Socinus and Thomas Carlyle, modified by the mysticism learned at the feet of Coleridge and Edward Irving, is mixed up with the ecclesiolatry of Pusey, Marriott, and Keble, and glossed over with an Evangelical phraseology and an earnest plausibility.&#x201C; Maurice&#x2019;s views had been well known before he joined the college&#x2019;s theology dept.; the present arguments against him were undoubtedly colored by his closeness to Christian Socialists like Kingsley. Sir Benjamin Brodie, member of King&#x2019;s College Council, which dismissed Maurice, said of him privately that he should not have connected himself with the Christian Socialists but that his only fault was a lack of worldly wisdom (F. Maurice, <hi rend="italic">Life of Frederick Denison Maurice</hi> [<date when="1884">1884</date>] 2:198&#x2013;99).</note> talked abstrusely, not very coherently; I see he is very deep still in <hi rend="italic">Claphamism</hi> of a sort,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clapham, a suburb S of the Thames, was the home of the &#x201C;Clapham Sect,&#x201C; an evangelical Anglican group that worked through missions and Bible societies to eliminate such wrongs as the slave trade.

Statistics would also prove that agricultural investment and the produce raised exceeded that of all other industries, that farmers were forward-looking and improving, and that foreign contributions to the country&#x2019;s subsistence was small.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>That Design seems to me extremely elegant and successful; and better judges than I admire it very much. We will take it with thankfulness, unless we can do still better.</p>
<p>The one point of question with me was in regard to the &#x201C;Thomas. Carlyle&#x201C;; which somehow seems too large and formal: I thought, and think, a common signature in my own hand, on a blank field, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> please my own eye better;&#x2014;but on the other hand, I partly perceive it might quite <hi rend="italic">overset</hi> the beautiful ingeniously <hi rend="italic">monumental</hi> look of the Piece.&#x2014; I send you some Signatures, in pencil and in ink, to try your kind hand upon.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wake pasted one of TC&#x2019;s signatures, &#x201C;the only one with the <hi rend="italic">full name</hi>,&#x201C; onto a piece of card (MS: NLS 7197.47).</note> Take the one you like best: the <hi rend="italic">size</hi> of it will regulate the size of the Plate; which should be as big as necessary, and no bigger. For the rest be sure to preserve this present Sketch: as I said, it will do excellently well, if there be not better. We will at least cut out the <hi rend="italic">point</hi> (.) between the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> and . the <hi rend="italic">surname;</hi>&#x2014;I should add also that the <pb id="pg-28-307" n="28:307"/>&#x201C;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>&#x201C; (which you have so cleverly got in) is not of almost any moment in respect to use, and may be introduced or left out, very much as opportunity offers.&#x2014; I can think of nothing to put on the square spot; tho&#x2019; something good might perhaps go there.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>On a candid survey, we like the former Sketch, on your own plan, decidedly better than any of these three done on mine. We will therefore stand by that,&#x2014;with or without any changes you may introduce. Perhaps you can reduce it a little in size: the &#x201C;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>&#x201C; at the bottom, tho&#x2019; very cunningly introduced, may be left out or retained according to your own feeling.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>&#x201C; was omitted from the final version.</note></p>
<p>I am farther charged to say that if you could <hi rend="italic">bring</hi> the thing in person,&#x2014;say <pb id="pg-28-308" n="28:308"/>on Monday evening, 7 o&#x2019;clock at tea, if you can get so far,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Fri.</note>&#x2014;it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be all the welcomer.

<p>Accept the will for the deed; and this hurried word here, among the infidels, under dim lamplight,&#x2014;instead of none at all. These two days I have been prevented writing, and it seems as if it were going to become a habit with me. I have written <hi rend="italic">six</hi> notes too at Chelsea today, not one of them on the least vestige of business belonging to <hi rend="italic">myself;</hi>&#x2014;and it seems, to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> there shall be no writing! Patience, patience!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I sent you yesterday a little Book; the <hi rend="italic">best-written</hi> French Book I have seen for years past. Most smoothflowing female Book: hardly Goethe with the highest could make a more harmonious composition than that Frenchwoman by inspiration of Nature alone. For the rest, nothing <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the Book (except perhaps that <hi rend="italic">death scene</hi> at the end);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably George Sand, <hi rend="italic">Les Ma&#xee;tres Sonneurs</hi> (Paris, <date when="1853">1853</date>), in which Joseph the piper is found dead at the end.</note> let it entertain some idle hour and half for you as it can.</p>
<p>Nothing is <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> with us at Chelsea; nothing is worse anywhere than usual,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">better</hi> perhaps rather: I am even trying (tho&#x2019; unsuccessfully) to <hi rend="italic">work</hi> a little, real working, after a sort. <foreign>Ach Gott</foreign>!&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> write tomorrow or soon, in spite of Fate!</p>

<salute>Dear Landor,</salute>
<p>Two nights ago, I received, thro&#x2019; Mr Mackenzie and the Parcels Company, your beautiful new Book with the pathetic title;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Last Fruit of an Old Tree</hi>.</note> and have already read far and wide in it, with many interesting feelings and impressions to myself, many kind thoughts towards you,&#x2014;thoughts of various sorts, and thanks and respects especially.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friends and reviewers praised the book, but Landor was irritated by the number of errors in the proofs, and he was particularly angry when Forster removed a piece on Eliza Lynn. He later angered Forster by encouraging publication of extracts of his <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> in the U.S. (<hi rend="italic">Landor</hi> 413&#x2013;14).</note></p>
<p>Sure enough this is a fine straight-stemmed broad-boughed &#x201C;Old Tree,&#x201C; and has dropped on us noble fruit, akin to the Hesperides Apples (I imagine),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Golden apples given Hera as a marriage gift and guarded by three sisters and a dragon.</note> for many a year: nor will I take this sad word &#x201C;last&#x201C; in any other sense than as <hi rend="italic">latest;</hi>&#x2014;by Heaven&#x2019;s blessing we shall yet have more of this Hesperides sort of apples from our good Tree; they are not plentiful elsewhere in these times! The fact is, I know simply one <hi rend="small-caps">Scholar</hi> now among us, in the old fine and beautiful sense that word once had; and him I will pray the Fates to preserve to us long!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You look into the eyes of Death withal, as the brave all do habitually from an early period of their course; and certainly one&#x2019;s heart answers to you, Yea, valiant Brother, yea, even so! There is a tone as of the old Roman in these things, which does me good, and is very sad to me, and very noble.&#x2014; I found <hi rend="italic">my own</hi> Epigram too; doubt not that.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The book has 50 pages of &#x201C;Epigrams.&#x201C;</note> I have found a great many things,&#x2014;and a Piece on <hi rend="italic">Petrarca</hi>, which surprises me (I beg many pardons) by its <hi rend="italic">impartiality</hi> to that wearisome wretch;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Petrarch (Francesco Petrarca [ <date when="1304">1304</date>&#x2013;<date when="1374">74</date>]), Italian poet, about whom Landor wrote in the book.</note> and looks in my mind like a perfect steel Engraving in the way of Portraiture. <hi rend="italic">Euge</hi> <supplied>[well done]</supplied>; on the whole, <hi rend="italic">Euge</hi> everywhere is the word.</p>
<p>Hume hangs over the mantel-piece, lighted from the garden, downstairs; and daily gets better acquainted with me.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning I was driven out by a body of upholsterers with carpets, curtains; I had to take my stick, and step out for a long walk, towards the good fat Neuberg&#x2019;s as I decided. He lives at Willesden in country seclusion, 7 miles off; I had a vestige of business too, and walked off since there was no help. Thro&#x2019; the smoky rage of the Edgeware Road, thro&#x2019; interminable rows of villas, intermixed with Carriers&#x2019; Inns, and dirty shops of ginger-pop: it was a heavenly relief to get at last into the silent country, with the clean tho&#x2019; cloudy sky above me: why is the son of man jammed into brick labyrinths; and sordid discords, of an avoidable sort, instead of having silence, free air, and the sun? &#x201C;Avoidable&#x201C;: alas, these too are <hi rend="italic">un</hi>avoidable, the lesser evil of two;&#x2014;and we had better not kick ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the pricks!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Acts 9:5.</note> Neuberg brought me homewards to Sloane street, in a dogcart he has; very cold; and there was darkness and dinner; and another day was gone, to little purpose, to join those beyond the Flood! This morning the good man has again been here; to get certain blurrings and paper-botchings of mine, and see if he can riddle any crumbs of sense out of them. A useful man, and a friendly and good, tho&#x2019; fat.</p>
<p>We had Thomas Spedding last night, James&#x2019;s elder Brother; a rational, instructed, but rather slow-going man; whom however I like. It is he that winded up his career as London Barrister long since by this notable peroration: &#x201C;Such, my Lord, are the grounds on which I am instructed to support this case; I cannot say I think them very strong ones!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; Good Heavens, here is another interruption: the Weimar Schoolmaster, and a murrain to him! Where is &#x201C;the lodge in some vast wilderness&#x201C;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cowper, <hi rend="italic">The Task</hi>, &#x201C;The Timepiece,&#x201C; l.1; cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300615-TC-HI-01"><sic>5:114</sic><corr>TC to HI, <date when="1830-06-15">15 June 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> ah where?</p>
<p>Well, I trust you have sunshine on the shore of your bright sea; and ride daily at a gentle rate, among &#x201C;butchers&#x2019; broom&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Common name for ruscus aculetus, called from its stiff branches being used for brooms.</note> (a memorable plant to me) and wild hollies, not without remembrances of favoured individuals, and with advantage to your own bright Self withal. Please Heaven, you are coming home &#x201C;about the end of the month&#x201C;; and about the beginning of the next (<date when="1853-12-04">4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date> is the day hitherto) we are to march. Such are the lots from Fortune&#x2019;s Urn: shall we not be thankful for them, <hi rend="italic">spoiled</hi> to the heart as they too often are? No complaining; indeed no talking: that is the right precept.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-311" n="28:311"/>Hudson, it appears, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> fairly ruined at last;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530225-TC-AHC-01">TC to AHC, <date when="1853-02-25">25 Feb.</date></ref> The final hearing of the case had been postponed several times, but the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1853-12-05">5 Dec.</date>, reported that Hudson had been ordered to repay &#xa3;54,000 to the York &#x26; North Midland Railway Co.</note> so we hope at any rate, and so I hear from various sides. One has but to <hi rend="italic">wait</hi> in this world; wait, and all carrion will ultimately evaporate, and vanish from one&#x2019;s path.</p>
<p>The idle world is speaking chiefly about the Turks,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Turkey formally declared war on Russia, <date when="1853-10-04">4 Oct.</date>, with hostilities beginning early <date when="1853-11">Nov.</date> Throughout <date when="1853-10">Oct.</date> and <date when="1853-11">Nov.</date> public opinion and the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, which had been neutral and in favor of peace in early <date when="1853-09">Sept.</date>, had become increasingly warlike and strongly in favor of the Turks. Charlotte Williams Wynn wrote to Varnhagen von Ense in <date when="1853-11">Nov.</date>: &#x201C;Carlyle I saw the other evening, in great force, violently Russian in his feelings, assuring me our victories were in truth so many defeats. He was, however, very pleasant when he got off politics to history and the time of his Frederic. Nothing could be more interesting than his conversation became then. He is such a picturesque talker that he transports one back to the period of when he is speaking&#x2014;I think his work is advancing and satisfying him better. He told me the more he studied Frederic the Great&#x2019;s character, the more he was struck by his thorough truth and earnestness of purpose, his sincerity and simplicity combined&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Memorials of Charlotte Williams-Wynn</hi>, ed. Harriot H. Lindesay [<date when="1877">1877</date>] 178).</note> for whom I care nothing; and about the Maurice question, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> also has no interest for me. Friedrich the Great said once to the orthodox of Neuch&#xe2;tel, &#x201C;If these people want to be damned forever, why not?&#x201C; To Maurice himself, if they thrust him from the Church altogether, it might do good rather than harm. That is a <hi rend="italic">confiscated</hi> affair altogether, and can in the long run yield only <hi rend="italic">bankruptcy</hi> of spirit to the like of him. Alas, human stupidity is great; I think sometimes it is the greatest; and see, with wonder and awe, how (as Schiller says) the very gods can never fight it down.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Die Jungfrau von Orleans</hi>.</note></p>
<p>For the rest, our weather here is damp fog with a spice of frost in it: on rare occasions, as today, the sun gets out for an hour; and always one guesses he is not far off,&#x2014;probably shining upon Sambo and you, as I love to fancy. Be thankful for it, gather strength from it; be merry of heart to meet your old sad friends with their rueful countenances.&#x2014; &#x2014; These evenings I am reading about Struensee and Queen Mathilde of Denmark; a sad hash of a business,&#x2014;ugly people almost all.

<p><salute>Dear Helps,&#x2014;</salute>I have been drifting about, these three or four days, under stress of <hi rend="italic">upholsterers</hi> (with carpets &#x26;c) and of other difficulties and hurries;&#x2014;could not write even a word till now.</p>
<p>You may believe me I am very glad to hear of you again; glad to think I sometimes accompany you, tho&#x2019; but as a phantasm of the mind, in your walks over the Hampshire heaths: I wish it were permitted me to be there in a more substantial manner. If one had no <hi rend="italic">body</hi>, if one had only a pair of wings, and could sleep at night by merely roosting on the first good bough, it might be possible; but as yet, alas, that is not the method, our gifts are far short of that!</p>
<p>About Maurice and eternal damnation I hear a great deal, from the idle circles of mankind; but to say truth, I have of myself almost no thought about it at all. Like the Frenchmen, tired with arguments ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the being of God, I may <foreign><hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi></foreign> [for an even stronger reason] say, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Mons</hi>r <hi rend="italic">je n&#x2019;y prends aucun interet</hi></foreign> [Sir, I am not in the least interested]!&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note>&#x2014; Perhaps it might do Maurice good if he were turned out of the Church altogether,&#x2014;which, it appears, is not likely at present. That splitting of hairs, which he has long laboriously carried on, to prove that he belongs to her, <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> ultimately turn to good for any creature. As to the Church herself&#x2014;Well, I should say, so long as she talks about damnation at all, she must make it &#x201C;eternal&#x201C;; there is no even <hi rend="italic">extinct</hi> worth in any other kind. God help her, poor old Church!

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I am again very much in want of news about my Mother, tho&#x2019; your last Note is not yet answered. Day after day, and yesterday in particular, I have intended to write; but, as usual, confused interruptions abound; and you see, I have not yet got it done, I am yet only doing it.&#x2014; Pray write me a word as soon as you can, how the dear old Mother gets along, in this harsh weather: I often fear for her, when I feel the harsh air; but, I suppose too, she is mostly in bed; the room kept very warm; and perhaps the weather makes less difference in her weak state, than it did when she was stronger. Alas, alas!&#x2014; Tell me, at any rate, how matters are. We have got out of rain here, into dim chill fogs, the sun hardly mastering them and giving us a bright sky, for perhaps two hours in the day (which two hours I generally <hi rend="italic">miss</hi>, being late with my work!)&#x2014; there is then, and indeed always, a good deal of <hi rend="italic">frost</hi> in the air: this morning my bedroom <supplied>[win]</supplied>dows were all frost-flowered, and out of doors everything was hard, under a sky of <hi rend="italic">reek</hi> and mist. I <hi rend="italic">run</hi>, rather than walk till heat come to me after my morning bath, and find in certain quiet rounds of streets, an excellent smooth pavement and do not quarrel with my walk or my atmosphere, putting one thing to another. On the whole, I ought to call myself <hi rend="italic">well;</hi> wonderfully well, for my years and long grumbling: there is really, at many times, very little fundamentally <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> with my <hi rend="italic">health;</hi> it is my <hi rend="italic">trade</hi> rather (as I may perceive) that weds me to pain, and has deformed all my life in that sad manner. We cannot help it; we must not complain! Jane, who is much weaker than I, continues to go out &#x26;c, and fights along with the best spirit she can. We have now, by her industry, got the new Drawing room (this where I now am) carpeted, curtained &#x26;c; and a capital room it is (nearly 20 feet square, by its new dimensions); and may serve us well for a winter-evening sitting-room for the rest of our time.</p>
<p>Before I forget let me bid you tell Jamie to tell Tom Garthwaite that his drawers and trowsers were perfectly the thing I wanted, fitting as well as need be; and that he, T.G., must now send me his account. Of the excellent and welcome oatmeal I now and then have a cup of <hi rend="italic">porridge</hi> as in old times; no equally agreable<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> and useful supper could ever yet be devised for me,&#x2014;and this in the <hi rend="italic">absence</hi> of first-rate milk, in the presence of only second or third rate. We have not broken into the Hams yet; but shall not fail, once the previous stock is cleared away. The butter did not seem to prosper quite; we thought, for some time, it might be the <hi rend="italic">top</hi> stratum (it never was <hi rend="italic">bad</hi>, yet <pb id="pg-28-314" n="28:314"/>never so good as intended): finally, the other day, Jane <hi rend="italic">exchanged</hi> it with her Butter-merchant, on fair terms, and is to have <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> butter, or new salt, instead (10<hi rend="italic">d</hi> a pound allowed): so that all is right on that side too.&#x2014; We had a Note from Jack this morning, Jane had; tomorrow (Saturday), as you know, he hoped to be at Moffat again. He will at least be nearer my Mother; tho&#x2019; alas I know not if he can do her much good! It will at least console one&#x2019;s imagination a little. As the Note is here, I may as well send it.</p>
<p>The other night some Americans were here; one of them, an official man in his own country, certified me that my <hi rend="italic">dormant</hi> American Bonds would yet be paid, principal and interest to the last penny, and that before long!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Butler (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1897">97</date>), lawyer, financier, land speculator, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, welcome in Britain for his part in handling the threat by some American states, in the <date when="1840">1840</date>s, to repudiate their bonds. He was one of the founders of the New York Union Theological Seminary and a leading member of the council of the City Univ. of New York. He was a convinced Presbyterian with an effective eye to the main chance. He and TC took to each other from his first visit to Cheyne Row with Delia Bacon, whose visit he had subsidized. He undertook to help TC deal with his holding of a $1,000 State of Illinois bond; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18540117-TC-CBU-01">TC to <sic>CB</sic><corr>CBU</corr>, <sic><date when="1853-02-17">17 Feb.</date></sic><corr><date when="1853-02-17">17 Jan. 1854</date></corr></ref>. About this time he wrote home: &#x201C;I spent last night with Miss Lynch at Carlyle&#x2019;s by special invitation through Miss Delia Bacon. We found Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle very interesting and pleasant. I was very much delighted with both of them&#x201C; (LeRoy E. Kimball, &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle and Charles Butler of Wall Street,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Essays and Studies in Honor of Carleton Brown</hi> [New York, <date when="1940">1940</date>] 282). They were to keep up their friendship and correspondence, which was to pass to Dr. John Carlyle and later to Froude.</note> Very well; it was a loss of &#xa3;230, to which I had quite reconciled myself; and so the &#xa3;350 it has now grown to will be like money found, and very useful in these present expenditures,&#x2014;if we actually had it! The truth is I never bother myself about money at all; having other far deeper bothers which quite abolish that.&#x2014; There is another thing I wanted to confide to you and to my Mother, tho&#x2019; it is a secret, and I wish you to keep it such. This is it. Prince Albert, as I know from a very sure hand (one Sir Ja<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Stephen, once an Official of weight) proposed me, at the end of this session of parliament to Lord Aberdeen for a Pension! <hi rend="italic">Canny</hi> Aberdeen, a douce, smallheaded, sleek and feeble old gentleman, whom I have seen once, and talked a little to, getting little but smiles and commonplaces in return,&#x2014;he shook slightly his canny head, and thought my &#x201C;heterodoxy&#x201C; on some points might be objectionable. And so it stands;&#x2014;and may as well stand; for I am sure I should have had to <hi rend="italic">refuse</hi> L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Aberdeen&#x2019;s offer (in the <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> and in the style he would have offered); and that would not have been pleasant. I consider it likely enough there will yet a <hi rend="italic">better</hi> offer of the kind be made, if I live some years; and that we can deal with, as shall then (on clearer grounds) seem good.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1874-12">Dec. 1874</date> Disraeli offered TC the Grand Cross of the Bath and a pension, which he refused; see A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NL</hi> 2:310.</note> Few men, I suppose, everi <hi rend="italic">wanted</hi> a Pension less: and if it is thrown me as a bit of a charity, I am bound not to take it; if <pb id="pg-28-315" n="28:315"/>either it, or the way of giving it, is not quite to my mind, why should I dream of taking it? &#x201C;Having carried on my work thus far, &#x201C; as Johnson said, with so little help from the powerful, I am content to finish it, if less be possible, with less!&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Letter to Lord Chesterfield,&#x201C; <date when="1755-02-07">7 Feb. 1755</date>.</note>&#x2014;and no Supreme Burgh Baillie (of the Aberdeen species), never so sleek or canny, &#x201C;can do the&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">aither</hi> ill <supplied>[n]</supplied>or guid&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ie., Lord Aberdeen is no better than a minor local official; for &#x201C;ill na&#x2019;gude,&#x201C; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440625-JWC-TC-01"><sic>18:83</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1844-06-25">25 June 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; This is the little bit <hi rend="italic">Secret</hi>, which is for my Mother and you.

<p><closer><salute>I must now end. Write to me, however briefly, what word you have. Give my continual affection to my Mother, for whom I would so gladly give something usefuller, if I had it. Alas, Alas! I send my heart&#x2019;s blessing to her and you all.</salute></closer></p>

<p>A bright frosty day; and I am just going out,&#x2014;with a sense of having altogether <hi rend="italic">failed</hi> within doors; which sense is very common with me, and very well grounded for most part.</p>
<p>To show my noble Lady what kind of things consume my small remnant of existence, and drive me into sad humours sometimes,&#x2014;read and burn (at any <pb id="pg-28-316" n="28:316"/>rate burn) the two inclosed Notes. It is a melancholy thing to be set up as a general target on which all the windiest fools of the Nation are incited to fire off their nonsense! And that is the main result of &#x201C;fame,&#x201C; so far as I can see,&#x2014;blessings on the pretty name of it. And Lord Aberdeen shakes his small canny head; and finds one heterodox. And in fact,&#x2014;we must be patient, and take the evil <hi rend="italic">along</hi> with the good, for they cannot be disjoined.</p>
<p>Here has been an immense operation; the getting of your Christmas Toys together;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For distributing at the Grange at Christmas.</note> which I can at length certify appears to be victoriously, and with good generalship, <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. May they make many a little heart happy; and give one great enough heart a good hour.</p>
<p>Maurice has withdrawn from his Female College too:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Through his sister Mary who had opened a school in Southampton, Maurice had become interested in the education of governesses, for which he founded the Queen&#x2019;s College for Female Education, 67 Harley St., <date when="1848">1848</date>.</note> he insisted on being <hi rend="italic">unanimously invited</hi> to continue; and there were one or two dissentients to that measure. I hope they have now done with it.</p>
<p>My &#x201C;work&#x201C; is quite overset again; lying tumbled into the ditch, wheels uppermost, these two days past. <closer><salute>Have pity on me, noble soul! I sometimes do almost <hi rend="italic">pray</hi> to you; and I think if you could answer, you would. Respects to Sambo at any rate.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The Birds arrived last night by the railway, in perfect preservation, and altogether right: I return you many thanks for so ingenious and obliging a Gift, which is very interesting to us here, independently of its intrinsic worth. These useful Grouse bring your wild solitary moors very vividly before one&#x2019;s memory, and in a pleasant manner, in these crowded noisy regions!</p>
<p>By this Post I have sent Mrs Bell two little Pamphlets of mine, which I hope she will accept: for yourself there is, likewise, a miniature <hi rend="italic">Allan Ramsay</hi>, much fitter for your eyes than for mine, on a winter evening;&#x2014;may it brighten a quiet hour for you now and then, in the dark weather.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Neuberg,&#x2014;</salute>Here is a Weimar letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From James Marshall, mainly about Eckermann. Marshall said that his earlier letter &#x201C;may have been ill-conceived and worse expressed. If so&#x2014;and if it has, in the smallest degree lessened your esteem for him, it will always be a source of self-reproach to me.&#x201C; He had meant to speak frankly but favorably. &#x201C;No doubt you must be sufficiently plagued and pestered on all hands. This is a kind of moral tax, which is usually levied on such men as you,&#x2014;it being so natural for the weak to fly for refuge to the strong. But you must not be too impatient when such men as Eckermann apply to you. Depend upon it, <hi rend="italic">such men</hi> do not often come to you on such an errand.&#x201C; Neuberg&#x2019;s trans. of <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> &#x201C;succeeds in Germany beyond anything of yours, which has yet appeared here. The translation is amazingly well-done&#x2014;not a tint or shade of the original lost. The Grand-Mar&#xE9;chal of our Court &#x2026; read the lecture on &#x2026; Luther, the other evening, to a select circle invited to his house for the nonce. Nothing could exceed the attention and interest it excited.&#x2014; I was asked if it were really and truly the case that you had extemporized those lectures. I answered that I had been told you had, but that I could scarce believe it possible. I promised, however, to enquire more particularly;&#x2014;and now beg you would put an end to our doubts on the subject.&#x201C;</note> which you may like to read, and then <hi rend="italic">burn</hi>. The same with <hi rend="italic">Vehse</hi>, which is not of any use otherwise.</p>

<p>Will you give me, as soon as convenient, some deliverance upon that Shakespeare MS.?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Delia Bacon&#x2019;s. On <date when="1853-11-12">12 Nov.</date> Bacon wrote to Emerson that TC had called on Parker about a week before, but found him &#x201C;still undecided.&#x201C; Impatient at this delay, she immediately wrote asking to withdraw the essay, but TC refused to let her send the letter, saying that Parker had just been thinking it over. &#x201C;After all the trouble Carlyle has taken about it,&#x201C; she thought that she would have to accept &#x201C;any thing like a decent offer.&#x201C; She realized that TC was &#x201C;violently opposed&#x201C; to her view: &#x201C;You know how hard it is to take him out of any track which his mind has once taken. He clings to the idea of the old &#x2018;booth-keeper&#x2019; [Shakespeare] and his spontaneity. &#x2026; But the last time I talked with him I thought he did seem to yield a little. At any rate &#x2026; he is constantly giving me &#x2018;aid and comfort,&#x2019; and doing all he possibly can in every way. &#x2026; I cannot thank you enough for concluding to give me a letter to him. &#x2026; I have experienced nothing but the most extraordinary courtesy and friendliness from him. I like him I cannot tell you how much. There is such a reality in him. And Mrs. Carlyle and I have become great friends. I think she is perfectly charming. &#x2026; Carlyle walks home with me. &#x2026; I assure you that it is for your sake that he is so kind to me&#x201C; (Massachusetts Hist. Soc.).</note></p>
<p>I think you might, on the terms you spoke of, print it:&#x2014;but you may believe me, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am quite impartial on the matter, and indifferent how you settle it; anxious only (for some reasons) that it <hi rend="italic">be</hi> settled as soon as you can.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am very sorry I cannot form the smallest guess as to the Motto on those two seals of your Oliver Letter. One thing seems evident: they were not put there by Oliver; the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> seal will alone be his, and the other two must have been appended by some subsequent possessor of the Letter. By whom, or with what intention, can only be matter of the vaguest conjecture; but Oliver himself, we may be as good as certain, sealed only <hi rend="italic">once</hi>, especially on that occasion, and by so sure a conveyance.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Faithful subject of the King, and palladium (<hi rend="italic">salus</hi>) of the Kingdom&#x201C;: these words might have been, in the language of flattery, till some 3 years before, a description of Oliver himself, in the dialect of the time: but now (in <date when="1650">1650</date>) there is no &#x201C;King&#x201C; nor &#x201C;Kingdom&#x201C;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles I was beheaded, <date when="1649">1649</date>.</note>&#x2014;it must have been an obsolete seal (signet&#x2013;ring or the like?); probably applied long afterwards,&#x2014;by Mrs Cromwell,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Cromwell, b. Bourchier (<date when="1597">1597</date>&#x2013;<date when="1665">1665</date>), Cromwell&#x2019;s wife, survived him by seven years.</note> or we know not what Possessor of the Letter, in <hi rend="italic">finally repositing</hi> the same.</p>
<p>For the rest, I have no considerable skill in such matters; having seen very few of Oliver&#x2019;s seals, and that only by accident, while looking for other objects.</p>
<p>What you say of Penn&#x2019;s grave is very interesting:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Penn (<date when="1644">1644</date>&#x2013;<date when="1718">1718</date>), English Quaker, founder of Pennsylvania, is buried in the Friends&#x2019; graveyard at Jordans, nr. Chalfont St. Giles, Bucks.</note> but I have little personal love for that heavy vain blockhead, in spite of his merits in several respects; and will not trouble you at present on his score.</p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I must not let the week end without a word to you and my poor frail Mother, on whom my thoughts so often dwell. I have heard twice from the D<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> his Note of today inclosed one he had got from you, which I was glad to read, as the last and most authentic news.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean&#x2019;s note to John, <date when="1853-11-23">23 Nov.</date>, which said that she meant to stay &#x201C;till the next week &#x2026; . I can make arrangements &#x2026; to remain here a while longer. I asked our Mother &#x26; she is anxious I should do so&#x201C; (MS: NLS 2883.227).</note> Things are not <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than we might have apprehended; they are better than our fears might have been! Poor Mother, I perceive, sleeps a good deal; and that is surely a favourable thing.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean reported to John: &#x201C;Our Mother slept <hi rend="italic">round the clock</hi> the night you left &#x26; yesterday was still sleeping a good part of the day&#x2014;We had not a bad night the last one either tho&#x2019; she was awake a good deal &#x26; complained of a pain in her breast. I got her a little gruel at 7 this Morning &#x26; she has had a good sleep since.&#x201C;</note> I fear she has not been out of bed at all in these late days? Indeed it is perhaps better not; for the weather is eminently unkind, even healthy people <pb id="pg-28-325" n="28:325"/>find it so. Jack, I conclude, will be with you today or tomorrow; and will write to me from Scotsbrig as his good custom is.</p>
<p>I keep <hi rend="italic">trying</hi> to work here; but with very indifferent success; however, there is no way of succeeding <hi rend="italic">but</hi> by trial. The consciousness of trying keeps my own mind more quiet; that at least is one result I can count on,&#x2014;a very small one.</p>
<p>The winter here is very unhospitable hitherto; I hardly remember more unpleasant weather than that of this week and last. A dirty damp dark frost, <hi rend="italic">rime</hi> or hoar-frost with <hi rend="italic">glazed</hi> streets the chief result of it, and no sun, nothing but <hi rend="italic">frozen mist:</hi> you cannot keep warm at all, except in bed (if even there) or in violent walking. For three days once it thickened into <hi rend="italic">frozen London Fog;</hi> ending on Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> night in such a black-sea of dirty atmosphere as put all wheel-vehicles to a stand, and made in fact one of the ugliest nights to be imagined. We kept close within doors, and suffered nothing. Rain followed, with at least <hi rend="italic">cleaner</hi> skies; and still continues.</p>
<p>On Monday week, it appears, we go to The Grange:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Fri.</note> I design to try if I can bargain for some room to work in, thro&#x2019; the forenoons; otherwise my time will pass rather ill there:&#x2014;on the whole, I never had less heart to go anywhither; but I suppose the country air will be useful: to <hi rend="italic">stir one up</hi> out of this sad stagnancy may on any terms be useful.</p>
<p>I will write again in a day or two. At present my fire is out (to say nothing of my <hi rend="italic">time</hi>), and I am cold into the bone, till I walk a couple of miles.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Say whatever is kind from me to my Mother: blessings on you all evermore!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You are very good in writing to me so punctually about my poor dear Mother, and the sad pathetic scene there is at Scotsbrig.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote from Moffat, <date when="1853-11-27">27 Nov.</date>, about his mother&#x2019;s health, then said: &#x201C;It seems useless to torment you with details at such a distance, as her fits of weakness are generally of very short duration, &#x26; often succeeded by long &#x26; tranquil sleep. She is evidently departing from us &#x2026; with pious resignation &#x26; trustfulness, with all her old affections as lively as ever, &#x26; without much visible distress or pain. &#x2026; / Jean got your note in the morning, &#x26; I read it to our mother, only leaving out what you say about being unwell &#x26; intending to leave London.&#x201C;</note> I got both your Letters, and am much obliged,&#x2014;and satisfied to know what the exact state of things is so far as you can judge or describe it. Alas, alas, it is even as you say: <pb id="pg-28-326" n="28:326"/>the good Mother is going from us; we cannot with all our art and prayers make her stay with us; and a sad and stern parting is coming on. It may be near, as I always say; it cannot be very distant! The thought of it never quits me; hangs like a black solemn pall over my mind and all the other miseries, mean miseries they, while this is great and high, that are in it. Yesterday morning I was in great distress about your Note, and quite embarrassed with the question whether I ought not to come off to Annandale immediately instead of to the Grange. &#x201C;Gaieties&#x201C; of any kind are far enough from what I want at present!&#x2014; After much consultation with Jane, who did not like to <hi rend="italic">advise</hi>, but could not refuse what her experience, later than mine, suggested to her upon Annandale,&#x2014;our opinion rather was that I must wait for a new Letter from you; and this morning it is that I must still wait, and be at your bidding, and in the meanwhile go on with my engagement here. We are likely to be &#x201C;dull&#x201C; enough, as she said, at The Grange (Henry Taylor &#x26;c &#x26;c): and I have farther bargained with our Hosts that I am to be private all the forenoon, and to try to go on with my work (so-called) as I am doing here. That is how it stands at present: we are to go on monday, if no farther warning be given. The Painters &#x26;c are all coming to finish off: and by Christmas, the undertaking is, they shall have finished, and be fairly gone, all but the Paperhangers in spring for one day&#x2014; If I could expect to be quiet <hi rend="italic">then</hi>&#x2014; But alas I fear, my room is irremediably somewhat of a failure; and that &#x201C;quiet&#x201C; is far off me yet! But we will not despair either; we will try many shifts before despairing.</p>
<p>I have no news here; I see very few people, and from those few very seldom get much but <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> and <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi>. Work alone has, in the least degree, some comfort for me; and, alas, I get terribly ill on with work. It is the old story: All the world (and the Devil) <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> one weak man: they tumble him about, &#x26; trample him in the mud, at a sad rate! Let him <hi rend="italic">stand to himself</hi>, the silly fellow; that is the one chance for him.</p>
<p>Miss Martineau and the Darwin set were here one night:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Wed., <date when="1853-11-23">23 Nov.</date>, when Neuberg was also invited; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531121-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1853-11-21">21 Nov.</date></ref></note> very wearisome is Harriet, tho&#x2019; very happy; victorious still over all ills and infirmities that beset other mortals;&#x2014;translating <hi rend="italic">Comte</hi>, or some windy French Prophet of the New Epoch;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte.

She &#x201C;had a message&#x201C; for me, two messages, of which I heard only one. This, namely, that a certain Mr (<hi rend="italic">Hunt</hi>, I think), Editor of the Daily News, &#x201C;an able and I think a very <supplied>[wise]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.

Neuberg was here another night; almost lost among the fog.&#x2014; Today, in the last place, Maurice entered; escorting one of the Sterling girls! He looks very fidgety, alarmed, and unhappy; but we got him comforted a little; and he went away in a more trustful humour. They say, it is not impossible he may lose his Lincoln&#x2019;s-Inn Preaching too;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maurice had been chaplain of Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn since <date when="1846">1846</date>. He kept his position.</note> he is decided to give it up if even one object to him. Poor Maurice, he has twisted and struggled at a great rate to be a Churchman; and now the Church throws him out. Perhaps it would be better if she did once for all send him gently out of doors; saying, &#x201C;No, you are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of mine!&#x201C;&#x2014;and he answering, &#x201C;No, indeed!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; His course is not out yet by any means.</p>
<p>But I must go, Dear Brother; I have written far more than is needful;&#x2014;and the dark twilight (fog &#x26; rain) is falling down. Give my best regards to Phoebe; and keep her well screened against the bad weather. <hi rend="italic">Four</hi> striking! I must go.&#x2014; &#x2014; Bell of Craigenputtoch, some fortnight ago, sent us 3 brace of grouse from his moors; which was a very spirited transaction,&#x2014; excellent birds too. I sent him a miniature <hi rend="italic">Allen Ramsay</hi> and my two Railway Pamphlets. That is his answer today.</p>

<p>I have very bad news from Scotsbrig&#x2014;alas, alas, and I know not what to do. A great sorrow, which has hung over me as a terror all my life, is now preparing for me there; may be near; cannot be distant.</p>
<p>As to my scheme of <hi rend="italic">working</hi> at The Grange, I really find that, except what was already said, I have properly <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> definite to say.

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Let me now present to you Mr S. Lawrence an Artist of great talent and accomplishment in the way of Portrait Painting (to whom I have repeatedly sat); and a truly worthy amiable and honourable man, whom I have long known as such. Being on a Tour in America for certain months (with more than one object), he will take Sitters as the occasion may offer. He is sincerely and highly esteemed by the best judges here; has in fact painted most of our best faces (Tennyson, Thirlwall<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Connop Thirlwall (<date when="1797">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875">1875</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27185"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390619-TC-JOST-01"><sic>11:132&#x2013;33</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1839-06-19">19 June 1839</date></corr></ref>), historian, liberal theologian, and bishop of St. David&#x2019;s, Wales.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c) as no other man among us can paint them. I think you will find in him truly a good fund of <hi rend="italic">tacit</hi> (unconscious) intelligence; presumably adequate for that and other tasks;&#x2014;and not unbeautiful to you and others that can recognise it.&#x2014; In a word, please to receive Lawrence as a good man, of good gifts, is sure to be received by you;&#x2014;and if you can in any way forward him, do not neglect to do it.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The Bearer of this Letter and Parcel is Mr S. Lawrence an eminent Painter of ours, who is going on a tour to America, for several objects, one of which is, to exercise his Art as occasion may offer. If you can conveniently in any way farther him, I will ask you to do it with a testimony that it is a <hi rend="italic">safe investment</hi> of beneficence, and a favour done to me and others of your friends here. I have repeatedly sat to Mr Lawrence (as have other friends of yours with success); and have long known him as a most amiable ingenuous intelligent and worthy man. He is not our most <hi rend="italic">popular</hi> Portrait Painter; but many think he ought to be so, or at least, that he has in him the talent for being our <hi rend="italic">best</hi>, which may be a slightly different matter. To my own knowledge, he succeeds admirably in <hi rend="italic">faces that have meaning in them</hi>,&#x2014;interprets it with really a rare discernment;&#x2014;and in fact is already our Chief Artist in that highest tho&#x2019; not most lucrative department. We hope he may find in the U.S. many faces that would suit <hi rend="italic">him</hi> well: many there must be that come under the definition of suitable for him, and some of them he should not fail to find! On the whole, if you can help him, I will again say it is safe to do so.</p>
<p>Mr Lawrence carries for me a little Packet to your Address; a strange old brown <hi rend="italic">ms</hi>., which never thought of travelling out of its native parish,&#x2014;but which now, so curious are the vicissitudes and growths of things, finds its real home on your side of the Atlantic, and in your hands first of all. The poor <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. is an old <hi rend="italic">Tithes-Book</hi>, of the Parish of Ecton in Northamptonshire, from about <date when="1640">1640</date> to almost <date when="1700">1700</date>; contains, I perceive, various scattered faint indications of the Civil-War time which are not quite without interest: but the thing which should raise it above all Tithes Books yet heard of is&#x2014;that it contains actual Notices, in that fashion, of the Ancestors of Benjamin Franklin, Blacksmiths in that Parish! Here they are, their forge-hammers yet going; renting so many &#x201C;yardlands&#x201C; of Northamptonshire Church-soil, keeping so many sheep &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;little conscious that one of the Demigods was about to proceed out of them. I flatter myself these old plaster-cast representatives of the very form and pressure of the primeval (or at least <hi rend="italic">prior</hi>-eval) Franklins will be interesting in America;&#x2014;there is the very <hi rend="italic">stamp</hi> (as it were) of their black knuckles, of their hobnailed shoes, strangely preserved to us <hi rend="italic">in hardened clay</hi>, and now indestructible if we take any care of it!</p>
<p>In the interior of the Parcel are the necessary farther indications of its history: I am very happy now to give up this <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. to your piety,&#x2014;such being <pb id="pg-28-331" n="28:331"/>the best dictate of my own piety upon the subject. To your wise keeping and wise disposal I now surrender it; and it is you that have it on your conscience henceforth, not I.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1857-04-10">10 April 1857</date> at the inauguration of Franklin&#x2019;s statue outside Old Government House, Boston, Everett presented the book, into which he had copied extracts from this letter and others from TC, to the Mass. Hist. Soc., where it still is.</note></p>
<p>A long time ago I talked of picking up an old Copy of <hi rend="italic">John Cotton&#x2019;s</hi> extinct Theologicals for you;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460504-TC-EE-01"><sic>20:188</sic><corr>TC to EE, <date when="1846-05-04">4 May 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> but mentioned, I think, that it had suddenly gone into other hands when I applied: it has never turned up again, nor perhaps ever will; but if it do, I will certainly have another dart at it.</p>
<p>I wish there were any chance of your coming back to England on a visit or otherwise! At any rate, do not forget old friends there who still well remember you.</p>

<salute>My dear good Mother,</salute>
<p>I wrote to Jean the other day, and have very little news to tell you; but I cannot let this day pass without sending you some word or other, were it never so insignificant.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was TC&#x2019;s birthday.</note> We are going into the country tomorrow, to The Grange, for two weeks or perhaps a little more; partly to let the Painters &#x26;c get done with that weary &#x201C;room&#x201C; of which you have heard so much; partly because the Ashburtons (whose <hi rend="italic">house</hi> we visited lately without their own presence) would have it so, and Jane thought we were bound. She will go therefore, and I having landed her there, am to have liberty to <hi rend="italic">leave</hi> again when I will: meanwhile I have bargained to be private, all day, in their big house, to go on with my work just as at home, &#x26;c &#x26;c: we will see how it answers; I confess I get no good of any company at present, nor except in stubbornly trying to work (alas, too often <hi rend="italic">in vain</hi>) is there any sure relief to me from thoughts which are very sad. But we must not &#x201C;lose heart,&#x201C; lose <hi rend="italic">faith</hi>,&#x2014;never, never!</p>
<p>Dear old Mother, weak and sick and dear to me while I live in God&#x2019;s creation, what a day has this been, in my solitary thought; for except a few words to Jane, I have not spoken to any one, nor indeed hardly <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> anyone, it being dusk and dark before I went out. A dim silent Sabbath Day, the sky foggy dark, with damp, and an unusual stillness the consequence. And it is this day gone fifty-eight years that I was born! And my poor mother&#x2014; Well we are all in God&#x2019;s hands. Surely God is Good; surely we ought to trust in Him,&#x2014;or what trust is there for the sons of man. Oh my dear Mother, let it ever be a comfort to you, however weak you are, that you did your part honourably and well while in strength, and were a noble mother, to me and to us all. I am now <pb id="pg-28-334" n="28:334"/>myself grown old; and have had various things to do and suffer for so many years; but there is nothing I have ever had to be so <hi rend="italic">much</hi> thankful for as for the mother I had: that is a truth which I know well,&#x2014;and perhaps this day again it may be some comfort to you. Yes, surely! For if there has been any good in the things I have uttered in the world&#x2019;s hearing, it was <hi rend="italic">your</hi> voice essentially that was speaking thro&#x2019; me: essentially what you and my brave Father meant and taught me to mean, this was the purport of all I spoke and wrote. And if in the few years that may remain for me, I am to get any more written for the world, the essence of it, so far as it is worthy and good, will still be yours. May God reward you, dearest Mother, for all you have done for me; I never can, ah no; but will think of it with gratitude and pious love, so long as I have the power of thinking. And I will pray God&#x2019;s blessing on you now and always,&#x2014;and will write no more on that at present, for it is better for me to be silent.</p>
<p>Perhaps a Note from the Doctor will arrive tomorrow: I am much obliged, as he knows, for his punctuality on that sad subject,&#x2014;he knows there is none so interesting to me, or can be. Alas, I know well he writes me the best view he can take; but I see too how utterly frail my poor Mother is; and how little he or any mortal can help. Nevertheless it is a constant solace to me to think he is near you: and our good Jean,&#x2014;certainly she does <hi rend="italic">me</hi> a great service, in assiduously watching over you; and it is a great blessing to us all that she is there to do such a duty.</p>
<p>As to my own health, I am almost surprised to report it so good: in spite of all these tumblings and agitations, I really almost feel <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than I have done in late years, certainly not worse: and at this time within sight of sixty, it is strange how little decay I feel,&#x2014;nothing but my <hi rend="italic">eyesight</hi> gone a very little, and my <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> (but also my fear or care at all) about this world gone a great deal!&#x2014; Poor Jane is not at all strong; sleeps very ill &#x26;c &#x26;c: perhaps the fortnight of fresh air, and change of scene, will do her some good. But she is very <hi rend="italic">tough</hi>, and a bit of good stuff, too: I often wonder how she holds out, and braves many things, with so thin a skin. She is sitting here reading; she sends her affections to you and to them all;&#x2014;she speaks to me about you almost daily, and answers many a question and speculation, ever since she was at Scotsbrig.&#x2014; I inclose a Cover, which Jean must return to me (if she can) with a word in it in a day or two. <closer><salute>Give my love to Jamie also, to Isabella and them all.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>We are got to our quarters as anticipated:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brookfield wrote in his diary, <date when="1853-12-06">6 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;Smoked with Carlyle in the Conservatory. At 12.15 I drove him to the Andover School, and Lord Ashburton arrived soon after. &#x2026; Carlyle put in a few questions of examination here and there in his odd way. &#x2018;Queen Elizabeth&#x2014;at what time was she alive in this world, and what did she do?&#x2019; It was amusing how he liked to put in his oar&#x201C; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:395). Lord Ashburton had offered prizes for teaching; see <hi rend="italic">Ashburton Prizes for the Teaching of &#x201C;Common Things.&#x201C; An Account of the Proceedings of a Meeting between Lord Ashburton and the Elementary Schoolmasters, assembled at Winchester, on &#x2026; <date when="1853-12-16">December 16, 1853</date></hi> (<date when="1854">1854</date>).</note> but it will not surprise you in the present state of matters I am very unhappy here. Especially after Jack&#x2019;s letter; which I got last <hi rend="italic">night</hi> after post-time, for it had been taken by mistake to Lord Ashburton, and by him forgotten all day: it threw me all into a shiver, as I read it by the lamplight (being outside, <hi rend="italic">smoking</hi>, when I got it); and it kept my sick thoughts tumbling about all night;&#x2014;and the feeling how far out of my place I was <hi rend="italic">here</hi> rose livelier and livelier! Alas, I have no very quiet home at present anywhere; and the thing I ask of mankind at large, That they would for the love of Heaven <hi rend="italic">leave me alone;</hi> cannot at all be granted!</p>
<p>The<supplied>[y]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> have put me here into room more fit for her Majesty than me,&#x2014;of vast size and perfectly secluded: here this morning I have installed myself, under the title of &#x201C;working&#x201C;; and with the <hi rend="italic">certainty</hi> at least of being completely solitary till 7 at night; and that is really the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> that can be done for me in this situation;&#x2014;to which must be added that the weather is soft and bright at once, and a very great improvement over anything we have seen in London lately with its drizzle and its fogs. But all this does not avail me for the chief misery that lies on my tho<hi rend="italic">ts:</hi> alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane asserts always I should be in the <hi rend="italic">way</hi> at Scotsbrig; no sleep or quiet (which I greatly need in this state of nerves) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be possible, she says &#x26;c &#x26;c. I want your word on this subject, dear Jean,&#x2014;as well as <hi rend="italic">your</hi> real thought about m<supplied>[y M]</supplied>other&#x2019;s state; for I cannot make much of John&#x2019;s hurried letters even as to that. Write me a word, please; but I know how occupied you are (perhaps by night as well as by day), and what an agitated state you must be in; and I will not expect or demand many words.</p>
<p>Wandering on Scotsbrig <hi rend="italic">Moor</hi>, I think I might be less unhappy than here; but how I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> lodge; and if I stood in the way;&#x2014;and my dear old Mother has never expressed any demand to see me, you said? That I can well understand <pb id="pg-28-336" n="28:336"/>too; and love her all the more for it. Ah me, words are very <hi rend="italic">dumb:</hi> may God forever bless her and us all!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have received both y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letters; which threw me into such a mood as you can fancy, and kept me indeed very miserable and agitated, till yesterday morning Jean&#x2019;s Letter (which I opened almost trembling) gave me some little relief again. Alas, alas, we may be certain what is coming, what is to all appearance near at hand; and we ought to be prepared for it: but this general misarrangement of all my outer and inner affairs, and so many mean sorrows and confusions lying in entanglement around that great one, are very perverse, and do load me heavily just now. Jean explains to me how you also are sadly hurried about, and have <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> the neighbour and patient you last mentioned to me. She herself also, one can conceive, has sad thoughts and a difficult task:&#x2014;and our dear old Mother, oh me, oh me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I live much alone here; which in some measure helps the incoherency of my situation. I have a huge room, well lighted warmed, and generally perfectly silent without and within; here I stay till about 3; then ride, also in solitude, till dark: no &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">work</hi>&#x201C; has hitherto come out of all that; but it is a welcome refuge to be alone. Poor Jane was with me yesterday almost all day, lying on the sofa &#x26;c; having knocked her brow against a corner of the mantelpiece, and flurried her nerves as well as wounded herself. She is now out, along with the rest, not complaining,&#x2014;but had in fact no sleep till towards six this morning: poor soul! I too am in very ill case hitherto with my diet, sleep &#x26;c here; which, till it <hi rend="italic">be</hi> got under order, aggravates one&#x2019;s sadness of humour.&#x2014; As to our company, it is nothing. The Taylors the Brookfields (friendly both, with the latter on the <hi rend="italic">mule</hi> side of the house),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note> these are the <pb id="pg-28-337" n="28:337"/>stock article, and the evening with these is sometimes spent in reading, and is at all times pacific enough. Today we have one L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Carnarvon, <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Lowe (and Official <hi rend="italic">albino</hi> of some talent) and his Wife,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Howard Molyneux Herbert (<date when="1831">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890">90</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13035"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 4th earl of Carnarvon, <date when="1849">1849</date>, politician. Robert and Georgiana Lowe. W. H. Brookfield wrote in his diary, <date when="1853-12-08">8 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;H. Taylor told at breakfast about some Americans <supplied>[who]</supplied> called on Wordsworth. &#x2026; This was apropos to a letter from the New York Library to Carlyle received this morning, offering him &#xa3;500 if he would go over and deliver six lectures&#x201C; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:397).</note>&#x2014;who, I suppose, will soon go again.&#x2014; When I cannot actually <hi rend="italic">write</hi>, I (invert now) have something by me to read, of a not quite worthless nature. I have an immense Conservatory temperature 50$DE to smoke in, and the weather is altogether bright for these 3 days,&#x2014;a great improvement (other paper now)</p>

<salute>Dear Marshall,</salute>
<p>This morning I have received here your second Letter,&#x2014;here in a big Country House, amid a big Christmas Party, where we are for a few days past;&#x2014;and I will write you a word to that effect at once, tho&#x2019; it be a brief one, owing to difficulties. I delayed always writing hitherto expecting daily that Wilson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Wilson.</note> would signify to me the closure of your bargain: but the man has never done so, tho&#x2019; he promised; nor has he yet written, but leaves me to hear the news first from the remoter extremity of the line.</p>
<p>However, it is at length all right, I hope; and indeed I am very glad, for the sake of both parties, that you have ended in this affirmative result. Wilson is a man of really excellent qualities, and certainly of high qualifications for the post he has now got. He is amiable to live with; he knows, and can teach; I think he may prove ornamental as well as useful among you, which latter alone he was bound to be. For one thing, if the Grand Duke is desirous, as appears, of an <hi rend="italic">English connexion</hi> for behoof of his Weimar Schools, there could certainly have no one been discovered likelier for that object. Wilson is already widely known and esteemed in the English circles fit for you; and he seems to be already making movements for an English <hi rend="italic">pupil-colony</hi> at Weimar, and to have high hopes on that side of the subject. He is a man of beautifully <hi rend="italic">hoping</hi> temper:&#x2014;I have warned him to beware of the opposite cognate extreme, and not to be too easily discouraged, if that really be (as I know not that it is at all) the weak point in him. But I know he will excite more good will from all of you; and would, were there no official relation in the case: so that after the first tumult is settled down, he will find Weimar (I expect) a very tolerably pleasant place to him.</p>
<p>I quite blush at the &#x201C;thanks&#x201C; of H.R.H. The Grand Duchess; my small service having been play not work, and a favour done to a deserving man of my own circle withal. Pray assure that high Lady that I long for an opportunity of doing something much more difficult under her orders, should that opportunity occur some day.&#x2014; And so, for the present, we will wish Good-speed <pb id="pg-28-339" n="28:339"/>to Wilson and to the new Weimar Academy he is becoming part of; and hope this small negociation may answer its good end, and never be matter of repentance to any party concerned in it.</p>
<p>You must also speak a friendly word from me to Eckermann! The good soul Eckermann: I am truly sorry for what has happened; and take the chief blame, or the sole blame, upon myself, and my overhaste, and want of due inquiry. But I pray you assure the good Eckermann he has lost none of my friendly feeling towards him, nor anything of my real disposition to help him;&#x2014;and that when the season of real distress arrives (should it unluckily ever arrive) he may count upon me, and any little faculty I might have, wholly as before this happened. And so let us forget it; there is nothing to be done with it but that.</p>
<p>I might write more to you; but as I said, my circumstances are bad. The very daylight is leaving me (shut out by these monstrous Ionic pillars and Greek architectures,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Grange was probably the grandest example of Greek revival architecture in England; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480929-TC-MAC-01"><sic>23:126</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1848-09-29">29 Sept. 1848</date></corr></ref>.</note> sorrow on them, under these grey frozen skies!)&#x2014;and there is a truly wondrous miscellany of Bishops, Foxhunters, Lords &#x26; Commons, not to speak of Ladies great and little, where by this time I am due down stairs.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. H. Brookfield noted, <date when="1853-12-09">9 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;The Bishop of Oxford [Wilberforce] and Trench came, p.m. &#x2026; The Bishop&#x2019;s conversation is not really good, and after Carlyle&#x2019;s it is very thin and tinselly. / A child at the school here, writing about a cart, said, &#x2018;A cart consists of several parts. Before making a cart it is important to understand how to make it.&#x2019; This Carlyle seized upon, repeating it more than once with unction. I told him it reminded me of his advice to Tom Taylor, who once applied to him for some hints for some lectures he was giving, &#x2018;Just say what you think, but find out first what you do think, if it be practicable.&#x2019; &#x201C; Again, on <date when="1853-12-10">10 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;I had stolen C.&#x2019;s little pipe out of the Moss House called &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Notre Dame du Tabac</hi>,&#x2019; and wrote a ludicrous note to C. first thing this morning, to save his going up and being disappointed. &#x2026; There was a spar after dinner between the Bishop of Oxford and Carlyle. The Bishop treated some observation of Carlyle&#x2019;s about the [royal house of] Guelphs &#x2026; with rather more laughter and irreverence than was due from so flimsy to so genuine a man; and contradicted him rather contemptuously as to George II. being a man of some worth. Carlyle was evidently angry&#x2014;which rather destroyed his fluency and presence of mind; but he maintained his point with some vehemence&#x2014;said he had searched such things diligently&#x2014;and if he (the Bishop) believed all the rubbishy carrion that was left about such and such people &#x2018;then you, my Lord Bishop, have a great deal more credulity than I have,&#x2019; and such like. The Bishop said &#x2018;all history&#x2014;all lives, proved them to have been a low, sensual, etc.&#x2019; Carlyle demanded the name of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> book. The Bishop talked on, trying to declaim him down, but evidently had no authority, said &#x2018;If you give me time and opportunity I will produce evidence,&#x2019; but I considered that he was vanquished&#x201C; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:397&#x2013;99).</note>&#x2014; I am at heart very <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> too; for certain reasons far away across the Scotch Border,&#x2014;ah me!</p>
<p><closer><salute>So on the whole I will end. May you too have what they call a &#x201C;merry Christmas,&#x201C; and like it better than I do!&#x2014; I remain</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I have a little task for you, to be done at your leisure when you stroll out; for there is no hurry in it,&#x2014;only do it some day, and let me know when it is done.</p>
<p>You know where Thomas Ballantyne lives, the little cheery man, once of the Manchester Newspapers? It <supplied>[is]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> in the Haverstock-Hill region,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NW London.</note> but I have not the N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> or name of the Street. Ballantyne told me of a little Book, published by Knight about <date when="1843">1843</date>, with some such Title as &#x201C;A working man&#x2019;s experiences in the United States&#x201C;; Book giving account of American <hi rend="italic">Strikes</hi> &#x26;c, the Strike of <date when="1836">1836</date> especially.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg replied, <date when="1853-12-17">17 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;&#x2018;The British Mechanics &#x26; Labourers&#x2019; Handbook, &#x26; true guide to the United States. Lond. Ch. Knight <date when="1840">1840</date>&#x2019; that is the title of the Book; of which, however, upon enquiry made, Knight had no copy left. But Mr Ballantyne has given me his Copy which he places entirely at your disposal. &#x2026; It is a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> book, and the subject of &#x2018;Strikes&#x2019; forms one chapter of it.&#x201C;</note> Ballantyne told me of it lately; and I wish to have a copy, if it be procurable by purchase. This is the task: so soon as you and he have found a Copy, please let me know. Ballantyne, I am aware, has <pb id="pg-28-341" n="28:341"/>one of his own which he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> lend me: but the truth is, Lord Ashburton is to be the principal reader of it, and I had much rather give him a copy of my own than a borrowed one,&#x2014;in as much as there is risk of its being <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> in these big premises!

<p>We are a miscellaneous rustic party here; consisting very much of women and children, engaged in Christmas Doll-making: distinguished strangers pass across the scene sometimes, but linger only for a day or two. I get no work done; but under the theory of working I pass my day in seclusion, up aloft here, and read at least, or prosecute my own sad reflexions The winter woods are very interesting, the rustic hamlets and habitations: our weather is always fogless, sometimes quite bright; today after a wild whirl of N.E. frosty wind we have it snowing (not likely to last long) the universe all simmering in white.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg replied, <date when="1853-12-17">17 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;The snow which you saw &#x2018;simmering&#x2019; has dressed us and all about here with a shining white carpet; trees and hedges beautifully silvered.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; We are coming home on Monday the 26<hi rend="italic">th;</hi> and hope to see you very soon after that. <closer><salute>Yours al<supplied>[w]</supplied>ays</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I got your Letter duly; and it was a great relief to me indeed, the morning it came. I have heard nothing since, either from John or you; every morning I lie awake in alarm for what the man will bring me (he comes in at &#xBD; past 8, with hot water &#x26;c, and brings what Letters there are): if he bring <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, that is in general one of the welcomest results to me; for, <hi rend="italic">except</hi> out of Scotsbrig, really most of the Letters I get are a real <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> to me, and do me no good whatever, but only evil, bringing namely a certain quantity of <hi rend="italic">trouble</hi> that I am to take, not for my own behoof at all but for some unknown person&#x2019;s, generally a fool&#x2019;s.&#x2014; I meant to write to you yesterday; but on calculating, I found you could not get my Letter till Monday, so that Today (Saturday) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the proper time. It is 3 days now since I had any news of my poor dear old Mother,&#x2014;whose weak low state, you may fancy, never leaves my thoughts at any time. Pray send me duly word of the actual state of matters; I often tell you, imagination is apt to be worse than reality, however bad that be. Alas, I cannot hope for good news just now! Give my heart&#x2019;s love to the dear and good old Mother: let her, and let us all, trust continually in One Higher than we. But write to me at any rate. Perhaps tomorrow something will come? Here everyday is a post day.</p>
<p>We had snow the other forenoon, after a most tempestuous night of N.E. <pb id="pg-28-342" n="28:342"/>wind: the country is all white ever since; and today there is a hard frost, very bright in the morning but now veiled into cold grey. I suppose that makes all little difference in my Mother&#x2019;s room, where you keep a good fire, and she is not strong enough to rise at all.</p>
<p>Our Party here comes and goes a little, tho&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">Kernel</hi> (Taylors &#x26; Brookfields) remains: we are at present rather fewer than usual; the only difference in which case is, that we are apt to spend our evening in <hi rend="italic">reading;</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi></p>

MS: NLS 605.386. Pbd: Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:236&#x2013;37. &#x201C;After her return, &#x2018;Friedrich&#x2019; still going on in continual painful underground condition, the &#x2018; sound-proof&#x2019; operation was set about, poor Charley [Chorley] zealously but ineffectually presiding; Irish labourers fetching and carrying, tearing and rending, our house once more a mere dust-cloud and chaos come again. One Irish artist, I remember, had been ignorant that lath and plaster was not a floor; he, from above, accordingly came plunging down into my bedroom, catching himself by the arm-pits, fast swinging, astonished in the vortex of old laths, lime and dust! Perhaps it was him that Irish Fanny, some time after, ran away into matrimony of a kind. Run or walk away she did, in the course of these dismal tumults, she too having gradually forgotten old things; and was never more heard of here. We decided for Addiscombe, beautifullest cottage in the world; the noble owners glad we would occupy a room or two of it in their absence. I liked it much, and kept busy reading, writing, riding; she not so much, having none of these resources, no society at all, and except to put <hi rend="italic">me</hi> right, no interest at all. I remember her coming and going; nay, I myself came and went. Off and on we stayed for several weeks till the hurly-burly here was over or become tolerable. Miserable hurly-burly; the result of it, zero, and &#x2018;Satan&#x2019;s Invisible World Displayed&#x2019; (in the building trade, as never dreamt of before!). / For the Christmas month, we were at the Grange, company brilliant, &#x26;c., &#x26;c.; but sad both of us, I by the evident sinking of my mother (though the accounts affected always to show the hopeful side); she, among other griefs, by the eminently practical one of Ronca&#x2019;s &#x2018;Demon Fowls,&#x2019; as we now named them, and the totally futile issue of that &#x2018;sound-proof room.&#x2019; &#x2018;My dear,&#x2019; said she, one day to me, &#x2018;let us do as you have sometimes been saying, fairly rent that Ronca&#x2019;s house, turn Ronca with his vermin out of it, and let it stand empty&#x2014;empty and noiseless. What is 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, to saving one&#x2019;s life and sanity? Neighbour Chalmers will help me; the owner people are willing; say you &#x2018;yes,&#x2019; and I will go at once and have the whole bedlam swept away against your return!&#x2019; I looked at her with admiration; with grateful assent, &#x2018;Yes, if you can&#x2019; (which I could only half believe). She is off accordingly, my saving champion (beautiful <foreign><hi rend="italic">Dea ex machin&#xe2;</hi></foreign>), and on the day following, writes to me (T.C.):&#x2014;&#x201C; (Headnote in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</sourceNote><head>

<p>Please send that Book at once,&#x2014;addressed to Lord Ashburton, thro&#x2019; the Post: you have to put sixpence worth of stamps on it, for wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I will be answerable when we settle the <hi rend="italic">Struensee</hi>.

<p>Thanks for your poor scrawl, my poor little Jeannie; the state of the penmanship testified too clearly what a pass you were still at! It was very kind and good to send that little word.</p>
<p>That note of John&#x2019;s is all my remaining correspondence for this day: I slept ill over night (some <hi rend="italic">new</hi> lodger already in your room); it was a dark damp-frosty morning: you may judge what spirits I was in!&#x2014; Well, I have made a resolution at last; and here it is. Namely:</p>
<p>I come home to you tomorrow (12 o&#x2019;clock train, which will be about 3 or 3&#xBD; at Chelsea); with the intention of going on to Scotsbrig on <hi rend="italic">friday morning</hi>. That I have signified to John tonight. On the whole, I must go: Lady A. admitted at once when I told her the case, that I ought to go <hi rend="italic">thither</hi>, without doubt. At any rate, to get out of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> has become a necessity for me; this is not supportable in my present condition!</p>
<p>Expect me therefore tomorrow afternoon. Neck-of-mutton broth? or what? I really do not care. You <hi rend="italic">need</hi> not be advised to put me a good fire in the bedroom, for it is and was very damp.</p>
<p>New people, of all kinds, are come or coming:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As well as those already named at the Grange on this visit, Brookfield recorded in his diary, <date when="1853-12-23">23 Dec.</date> (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:400), James Spedding, G.

<salute>My dear Jeannie,</salute>
<p>I have got here safe; and after many misgivings, find my poor old mother still in life, still able to recognise me with a gleam of faint joy,&#x2014;a thing for which I heartily thank God.&#x2014; The poor old Mother, she seems to have had yesterday some kind of crisis, or long fainting-fit, and is rallied in some slight degree today. But Weakness itself could be no weaker: a more spent creature I never beheld. I burst into tears at sight of her. Her hand is cold and slightly swollen; she lies half asleep; brings up from time to time a little phlegm, which Jean has to clear away, asks for a sip of water; at times is sickly, and her mind wandering. Alas, alas, sinking in the turbid waters; sinking towards Eternity.</p>
<p>John is here, and full of bustling activity and kindness;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John wrote to Phoebe, <date when="1853-12-24">24 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;My brother stands in the way of none here, and his presence is a solace to us all, though he is quite helpless as a nurse even to himself&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> Jean, poor soul, is quite worn down, but seems to be unweariable in affectionate nursing. There are bricklayers from Carlisle in the kitchen; the grate, oven and fireplace all lying topsy turvy. I am, at present, in the East room, which Isabella has in a very tidy state,&#x2014;not warm, in spite of a strong fire. I mean to try for a little sleep, were this line despatched: I got no sleep, but also no mischance or inconveniences in the long swift nocturnal transit; maintained fresh air by a window of my own; suffered nothing from cold; have only a dull heavy headache (which breakfast has not removed); and shall probably <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> it away,&#x2014;at least, if night were come. My mother spoke of &#x201C;Jane,&#x201C; some indistinct but kind whisper, when she first saw me.&#x2014; This seems to be all I need say today.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-347" n="28:347"/>You have done the Roncas I hope; for they seemed to be under the <hi rend="italic">screw</hi> somehow, and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were not the hand to be soft with them in that case. A strictly imprisoned Macaw, poultry <hi rend="italic">boiled</hi> all into quiescent <hi rend="italic">soup</hi>,&#x2014;and a hint too about the noisy drawingroom might perhaps not be improper? Do your best; I know you will. &#xa3;5 or &#xa3;50, really at either price it is cheap to have done with them! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>Thank God, I still find my poor old Mother living, still able to recognise me with a faint gleam of joy from amid the dark waters where she is struggling and sinking. It was a great mercy to me, this morning; I had a night of sad misgivings: this was all I had a right to ask, and this was granted me.</p>
<p>For the rest, her weakness is extreme; a more spent creature, with life, with intellect, still left, I never saw. Ah me, ah me! But we must not quarrel with the inevitable: let us look into the heart of <hi rend="italic">Sorrow</hi>, find also what Sorrow means, when that comes to be the task set us.</p>
<p>I will write another word probably before long. Today I am loaded with dull headache from the railway, not to speak of other still more inarticulate burdens, and ought to be silent. But the eyes I saw wetted for my sake the other day are still present to me; and no part of your noble goodness to me is or can be forgotten.</p>

<p>Thanks, <salute>Dearest</salute>: all is well (apparently) at Chelsea, except your want of sleep and of letters;&#x2014;I sent for your letter today, and got it by express,&#x2014;in the saddest of all scenes; about noon, while we waited, all of us, in dread uncertainty for an Event, which has now <hi rend="italic">arrived</hi>.&#x2014; All is over now; and the Weary One is at rest. At ten minutes past 4 this afternoon she ceased breathing: it is now little past 5; and I must write immediately, or miss the post. You will not expect many words from me. She had been in uttermost weakness ever since I arrived; yet never in severe pain or distress till yesternight about dusk, when her breathing began to fail, and she suffered great trouble for some hours from that cause, and tried unweariedly many shifts for it, retaining her intellect and presence of mind, and tender affections even, to a degree that was quite wonderful to me. About 11 o&#x2019;clock, John gave her some few drops of laudanum, which brought some relief, and about midnight she seemed disposed to fall asleep. When I entered the room about 10 minutes to 12, John said, &#x201C;Here is Tom come to bid you good night.&#x201C; She nodded assent; whispered audibly to me, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m mickle obliged to thee!&#x201C; Those were the last words I ever heard her say. This morning, so soon as I got admittance, my impression was, the end had now come. She lay in heavy short-breathed sleep, the features waxing stony, the expression stern and grand rather than sad; so it lasted with hardly any change, except sometimes a little in the force and quickness of the breathing: towards 4 p.m. the breathing suddenly sank lower; and at 10 minutes past, without a struggle of any kind, the breathing, after 2 or 3 pauses, had ceased. Such a moment, such a scene, I shall remember thro&#x2019; Eternity. We all wept.&#x2014;&#x2014; I have now ceased weeping. I will not write even to you any more tonight.</p>
<p>I am well enough in health; and have even got very tolerable sleeps these two nights. I reckon it a great mercy indeed that I found my Mother still alive when I came. She continued to recognise me, always with a peculiar affection; tho&#x2019; her mind sometimes wandered, she was only once at a loss for my name, and in a few minutes sent for me from the other room to say that she ay and right well remembered <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. God be thanked; God make me thankful.&#x2014; Last night late, while the struggle for breath was very sore, Jean had gone out for coals (Sunday coals) into the little shed you may remember: &#x201C;Where&#x2019;s Jean?&#x201C; asked my Mother: When John told her, she bade the candle be held to the window for light to Jean. I never saw such a trait, nor hardly <pb id="pg-28-350" n="28:350"/>heard of such.&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>Good night, dearest: I know you will pity me; and respect my sorrow, a just and great one,&#x2014;of Nature&#x2019;s own sending. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> Dearest</salute></closer></p>

<p>No letter from you today, alas; and I suppose there is not even a chance in the evening; today being kept as Xmas there will probably be no evening delivery. At all rates I have the satisfaction of knowing that you found your <pb id="pg-28-352" n="28:352"/>Mother alive, and that she knew you&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">That</hi> will be a lasting consolation for you; however it may be with her <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. I dare say you thought me rather cruel in urging you onward without more rest&#x2014; But I knew how you would suffer, better than you did yourself, if by waiting till Friday you had missed her last kind look.</p>
<p>Your note came on Saturday evening&#x2014; And the bill from Adamson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Adamson. JWC is writing on Mon.</note> at the same time. Chorley came for it this morning. a little more <hi rend="italic">human</hi>, not to say <hi rend="italic">humane</hi>, than when I saw him on Friday. No letters have come for you of any moment; I send them such as they are&#x2014; To have to read <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> may be a distraction for you in your present circumstances. My letters continue to come to me all round by the Grange&#x2014;although I wrote both to Auchtertool and Liverpool that I was come home.</p>
<p>This morning I had a note from the Grange itself, Lady A wrote to announce &#x201C;a little bracelet from The Tree&#x201C; which Mrs Brookfield was bringing up for me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brookfield noted, <date when="1853-12-24">24 Dec.</date>, &#x201C;In the evening at five was a magnificent Xmas Tree, with all the School children and their friends; a bracelet was assigned to JWC&#x201C; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:400).</note> I laid the note carefully by (as I thought, when I was clearing away an accummulation of papers this morning) in the intention of sending it; and when I went just now to the basket to take it out, I found only <hi rend="italic">the envelope!</hi> the note itself must have gone in the fire with the rest. But I can tell you all that was in it. first about the bracelet&#x2014;then that she would be &#x201C;sorry to lose the three weeks of affectionate greetings morning and evening that were to be broken up today&#x201C; then, that she had had a note from you on your arrival at Scotsbrig; but did not write to you for you might be returned to Chelsea before her letter could reach&#x2014; Lastly how much money did she owe me? and that the turkey was sent <hi rend="italic">without</hi> orders&#x2014;and there you have the whole, I think&#x2014;</p>
<p>Nothing has happened since the poultry was all removed&#x2014;to the last feather&#x2014;on Saturday afternoon Enough of <hi rend="italic">happening</hi> that! for months to come! I have written our thanks to Martin<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >H. J. Martin or his father about Ronca&#x2019;s fowls.</note>&#x2014;also to Redwood&#x2014;whose unfailing box arrived on Saturday afternoon. Welsh mutton&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">unusually small</hi>&#x2014;which Anne and I are quite up to eating our two selves&#x2014;a Turkey&#x2014;given immediately to Piper&#x2014;a Hare&#x2014;sent with &#x201C;grateful compliments&#x201C; to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Morse at No 8,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Moss (<hi rend="italic">P. O. Guide</hi>, <date when="1854">1854</date>).</note> who was so civil about <hi rend="italic">her</hi> poultry. And a little cheese which will keep.</p>
<p>A nice <hi rend="italic">Haddington cake</hi> was handed in at the door the same day in a band-box with the direction in dear Betty&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid.</note> handwriting; not a word spoken, not a penny to pay! How <hi rend="italic">does</hi> Betty manage that?</p>
<p><pb id="pg-28-353" n="28:353"/>I see nobody having not told anybody as yet that I am here&#x2014;and had no time or spirits as yet to go anywhere.</p>
<p>Yesterday was especially silent; for I let Ann go home for her holiday&#x2014;and was quite alone with Nero till eleven at night.</p>
<p>My only &#x201C;putting up the Xmas&#x201C; was the breaking the seal on your present, and hanging it about my neck.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The envelope was addressed: &#x201C;To my dear little Jeannie / with ever true affection / T. Carlyle / The Grange, <date when="1853-12-25">25 dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> / 1853</date>&#x2014;,&#x201C; with a note: &#x201C;<date when="1853-12-25">25 dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1853</date>&#x2014; / May they teach thee to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> clearly! T.C.&#x201C; JWC added a lock of hair to the envelope and wrote: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Helen Stewart</hi> died in the 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> year of her age&#x2014;the young heart crushed in her by inhumanity and meanness which could not forget the fault that was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> hers in the <hi rend="italic">beautiful qualities that were</hi> / &#x2018;<foreign>Rose, elle a vecue la vie d&#x2019;une rose l&#x2019;espace d&#x2019;un matin</foreign> [Rose, she lived as does the rose, in the space of a morning]!&#x201C; TC noted: &#x201C;an early Friend&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">hair</hi> (with an inscript<hi rend="italic">n</hi> by <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Jean (<date when="1866-07">july 1866</date>).&#x2014;T.C.&#x201C; (MS and memento: Strouse). Helen Stewart is not identified further. JWC quotes Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois de Malherbe, &#x201C;Consolation &#xE0; Monsieur du P&#xE9;rier.&#x201C;</note> I like it so much&#x2014;and it suits my eyes capitally&#x2014;I expected a <hi rend="italic">pretty</hi> glass (I divined of course it was a glass) but it is a much handsomer one than I should have been contented with&#x2014;</p>
<p>Catch me ever wishing for any expensive thing before you again!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Piper has just been here with bread, and tells me positively; No&#x2014;there will be no evening delivery.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know how you feel about it; but I assure you, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am very thankful to have terminated the cock-business in &#x201C;forcing the Roncas to come voluntarily&#x201C; and offer us the poultry, instead of in getting the house on our hands with the Pipers in it&#x2014; I was <hi rend="italic">resigned</hi> to wave <hi rend="italic">my</hi> one objection to the Pipers&#x2014;but I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> what grievances would come of such proximity to that gossiping woman&#x2014; Something has been between Ann and her since I came home which has brought out her duplicity in a way that would have increased my horror of her at next door had it been so settled.</p>
<p>Oh dear me! perhaps you are too ill and miserable to care about this long letter. I shall be so anxious till tomorrow.</p>
<p>My love to them all&#x2014; Poor Isabella with her fire place &#x201C;all topsy turvy&#x201C;! and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> whom she is so anxious to make comfortable plumping down on her!&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>My dear little Jeannie,&#x2014;&#x2014;</salute>We are here in the house of mourning, and I can have no news to send you; but I will write a word, to satisfy a want of my own, <pb id="pg-28-354" n="28:354"/>in case you should be expecting a word. I slept badly last night, and had abundance of ghastly enough reflexions; but I am not the least in bad bodily health; so let not that be an addition of distress to you. In general my feeling is that of solitary misery, of sad bereavement, and approximation to the pale kingdoms where human thought fails and is silent: but it flickers like a gleam of wintry sunshine over the black confusion of my mind, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Elle ne souffre plus</hi></foreign> [She suffers no more].&#x201C; Her fight is ended; honourably done;&#x2014;and God is great, God is good and just: that is all we have to say.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote a long account of his arrival at Scotsbrig and his mother&#x2019;s death in his Journal, <date when="1854-01-08">8 Jan. 1854</date>. &#x201C;The Funeral was on Thursday; intense frost had come on the Monday night. I lingered about Scotsbrig, wandering silently in the bright hard silent mornings and afternoons; waiting till all small temporal matters were silently settled (which they decently were).&#x201C; See Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:142&#x2013;45.</note></p>
<p>The Funeral is to be on Thursday; I may, if I like (as is probable) be home by the end of the week.</p>
<p>We have the beautifullest chill clear <date when="1853-12">December</date> weather; I pass much of my day sauntering about the fields, under sheltering hedges: in &#x201C;7 minutes&#x201C; (it appears) I am to attend John to his Ecclefechan station: <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is going off, poor fellow, and a great increase of composure is certain to result till Thursday.&#x2014; Jean is just gone, along with Mary who came this morning to <hi rend="italic">see</hi>, and heard the sad news at her arrival. Jean is quite worn out,&#x2014;never recovered from her <hi rend="italic">dead child</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530518-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <sic>[<date when="1853-05-20">20 May</date>]</sic><corr>[<date when="1853-05-18">18 May</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> (as she told me); her eyes look very excited; and it is certainly a blessing that she is now to have some rest.</p>
<p>Jack sits waiting; I must not add another word. Ten minutes ago he gave me a fresh cause of uneasiness: it seems the Bankers now need one of <hi rend="italic">Gladstone&#x2019;s stamps</hi> put on their money orders; and some <hi rend="italic">won&#x2019;t</hi> pay without it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As a tax on bank money orders, resulting from Gladstone&#x2019;s budget; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530429-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1853-04-29">29 April</date></ref>.</note> What a vexation if Adamson were in that case, and your money had not only not been <hi rend="italic">delivered</hi>, but had never come! However, I persuade myself he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> at least have written to say so; and that on the whole all is right.</p>

<p>My dear kind Jeannie&#x2019;s Letter came this morning again, and is a great comfort to me in my solitude. I wish they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get into the way of delivering their Letters regularly at Chelsea, amid their Christmas festivities: it is there, not here that the failure lies: I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> a Letter for you put into the Postman&#x2019;s hand, so as to be due at your breakfast time today; perhaps that also may be delayed till night in the press of the season.</p>
<p>I slept better last night; I am what may be called <hi rend="italic">well</hi> in bodily health; full of sadness, all manner of late and early things walking in funeral procession thro&#x2019; my heart; but there is something soft and sacred in them too; and my mind is in a more composed and human state than for a long while past. I am left well alone in this East room: <hi rend="italic">her</hi> Corpse and I the only tenants upstairs. Jamie is kind and honest as a soul can be; comes and sits with me, or walks with me when I like; goes gently away when he sees I had rather be alone. Isabella is the best and politest of landladies; keeps the rooms, this and the next, glowing with fires all day, and almost all night; makes me excellent coffee in the morning &#x26;c &#x26;c, and effaces herself altogether when not wanted. I have been once or twice in that deserted white-sheeted Place; have looked, in silence, on the sight that passes all speech there. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m muckle obliged t&#x2019;ye&#x201C; (I fear, it was &#x201C;t&#x2019;ye,&#x201C; not &#x201C;to thee&#x201C;): these were about the last conscious words she spoke in this world. An hour after, when the laudanum began to operate, John asked her Are you easier mother? to which she answered <pb id="pg-28-356" n="28:356"/>&#x201C;Yes&#x201C;; and again some three hours later still, on his asking her, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> she have something (I think some sip of drink she had often been demanding earlier), she whispered &#x201C;No&#x201C;: she never spoke again, nor indeed did we like to speak to her in the Presence that was now evidently nigh.&#x2014; Oh yes, Oh yes, I am bound to be forever thankful that I got here in time! Not by my own wisdom either, or by any worth in my own management in the affair: had I staid at The Grange, and received the news <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, it would have driven me half-distracted, and been a remorse to me till the end of existence. Good old Mother, I was privileged to give her yet one faint gleam of joy in this world; and to get from her, as you say, her last kind look; and those unforgettable words, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m muckle obliged t&#x2019;ye&#x201C;&#x2014;a kind of summary of all her relations towards me since I first came to her in this world. God be thanked, God be thanked. A few minutes before, she had bidden them <hi rend="italic">light</hi> Isabella down. The more I think of that last night of wrestle with the King of Terrors,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 18:4, like James Carlyle; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 10.</note> and of such clear insight, patience, generosity, and simple dignity and valour, I am the more struck by it, and the gratefuller to God that gave me such a mother. May I be worthier of her for the years I may yet have to live: no other good, worth mentioning, or wishing, is visible to me at present.</p>
<p>Tonight Jamie goes with me in the dusk to poor old Grahame, whom I have now surely not many times to see again here. We have to be back at nine: the Middlebie Joiner&#x2014;Ah me!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably with the coffin.</note> I mean to look upon her face once again, and not more. John, Jean &#x26;c, they all come back tomorrow night; and next day is Thursday. Last night I address about 150 letters;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of the printed notification of the funeral: &#x201C;Scotsbrig, <date when="1853-12-26">26th Dec., 1853</date> / Sir, / M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Margaret Aitken Carlyle, my Mother, died here yesterday; and is to be interred at Ecclefechan Churchyard on Thursday, the 29th instant. / The favour of your Company on that occasion, at 12 o&#x2019;clock, Noon, will much oblige, / Sir, / Your Obedient Servant, / Thomas Carlyle&#x201C; (Printed circular: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> Jamie, his son John &#x26; the little <foreign>lassie</foreign> assisting. It was as good as sitting in the company of thoughts; as good or nearly so. I have a kind of wish to see her poor small heritage parted suitably among the four five<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC possibly thought first of his four brothers and sisters in Britain, then included himself, but excluded the two in N America.</note> whom it belongs to, before I go: after that, Eternity holds all that was my Mother for me. I think it likeliest I shall be home to you on Saturday, late, about midnight; but do not yet know.&#x2014; Meanwhile I am really well in health here, as I said: two days ago, I got my morning tub of water again, my morning walk &#x26;c. Our bright weather is changed suddenly into bright iron frost; the Burn all bridged; such a frost as I have seldom seen in one night. Today already I have been on the top of Stockbridge Hill (the <hi rend="italic">Moor</hi> road we used to ride from Lockerby); I was close-buttoned, with my <pb id="pg-28-357" n="28:357"/>shag waistcoat, and not too warm tho&#x2019; walking hard. The world is bright as a diamond everywhere; Queensberry rose white and huge, behind Lochmaben on my right hand, I fancied I might see among the dimmer heights the Craig of Drumcore, and old Localities of ours: all was solitary as Hades, silent except for the universal rushing of a strong northwind. If no snow fall till after Thursday, it will be well.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, I do rejoice at your victory, gained for me, over those unendurable Roncas; it is as I predicted always, once you had taken it in hand: that sordid, base and yet immense annoyance is away,&#x2014;thank Heaven, and <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, for really I could do no more in it, and was as good as beaten there. I am glad too you can see with your Glass; provision was for a <hi rend="italic">change</hi> of glasses if needful, but it will not be so. It was a great relief to me, also, that you had got your money: that notion of John&#x2019;s, about Gladstone&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">stamps</hi>, had been bothering me since yesterday; and I had arranged to send you today, if necessary, payment for Chorley at least.</p>
<p>Surely this is enough, Dear: I know not why I have written so long, with really nothing to say but what was presupposable I know not whether it is good to write such things even to you.&#x2014; I have still two Notes to do: Neuberg, Tho<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Erskine; but a couple of lines is all that either of them will get. John did write to Liverpool, I think, and to Auchtertool. My Mother spoke several things about Helen,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Welsh died ca. <date when="1853-12-18">18 Dec.</date>; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531230-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1853-12-30">30 Dec.</date>]</ref>.</note> and had woven her tragedy into her own in the last days.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And now good night, Dearest: it is fairly past 3, and you cannot get this till afternoon tomorrow.&#x2014; I say again, take care of yourself; and let us both try to be <hi rend="italic">better</hi> by these stern sorrows.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I received your last Letter here, whither a sad and sacred call has drawn me. I quitted The Grange on Wednesday; left Chelsea on Thursday Evening, and got hither next morning;&#x2014;to the tenderest meeting that could well be provided for me on this side of Eternity. My brave old Mother, worn down to the last stage of bodily weakness, had still her faculties of intellect and heart in a wonderful degree of clearness;&#x2014;recognised me still with a feeble gleam <pb id="pg-28-358" n="28:358"/>of real joy; and thanked God with me to the end that we had been permitted to meet once again before the final parting in this world. What I have seen and experienced since is not to be lightly spoken of in words. She quitted us at last, after long sorrows and sufferings nobly borne, in a mercifully gentle way, at 4 o&#x2019;clock on Sunday afternoon,&#x2014;leaving surely ineffaceable remembrances, and an example of simple dignity, courage, generosity and human worth, continued to the very end, which ought to be a high and sacred lesson and monition to all that were connected with her. We are called to say, as from of old, God&#x2019;s great will be done.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I return to Chelsea probably about Saturday night.&#x2014; I had got your Note at The Grange, and Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> had got your Book. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> till we meet,&#x2014;next week, as I conjecture and hope.</salute></closer></p>

Pbd: Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:243&#x2013;45. &#x201C;From the Grange I must have followed in three days. The Scotsbrig letters on my mother&#x2019;s situation were becoming more and more questionable, indistinct too (for they tried to flatter [raise hopes in] me); evident it was the end must be drawing nigh, and it would be better for me to go at once. Mournful leave given me by Lady Ashburton; mournful encouragement to be speedy, not dilatory. After not many hours here I was on the road. Friday morning, <date when="1853-12-23">December 23, 1853</date>, got to the Kirtlebridge Station; a grey dreary element, cold, dim, and sorrowful to eye and to soul. Earth spotted with frozen snow on the thaw as I walked solitary the two miles to Scotsbrig; my own <supplied>[one?]</supplied> thought and question, will the departing still be there? Vivid are my recollections there; painful still and mournful exceedingly; but I need not record them. My poor old mother still knew me (or at times only half knew me); had no disease, but much misery; was sunk in weakness, weariness, and pain. She resembled her old self, thought I, as the last departing moon-sickle does the moon itself, about to vanish in the dark waters. Sad, infinitely sad, if also sublime. Sister Jean was there. Mary and she had faithfully alternated there for long months. It was now, as we all saw, ending; and Jean&#x2019;s look unforgettably sad and grand. Saturday night breath was nearly impossible; teaspoons of weak whisky punch alone giving some relief. Intellect intrinsically still clear as the sun, or as the stars, though pain occasionally overclouded it. About 10 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi> she evidently did not know me till I explained. At midnight were her last words to me, tone almost kinder than usual, and, as if to make amends, &#x2018;Good night, and thank ye!&#x2019; John had given her some drops of laudanum. In about an hour after she fell sleep, and spoke or awoke no more. All Sunday she lay sleeping, strongly breathing, face grand and statue-like; about 4 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi> the breath, without a struggle, scarcely with abatement for some seconds, fled away whence it had come.

<p><salute>Oh my Dear!</salute> Never does one feel oneself so utterly helpless as in trying to speak comfort for a great bereavement. I will not try it. Time is the only Comforter for the loss of a Mother. One does not believe in Time while the grief is quite new. One feels as if it could never be less. and yet all griefs, when <pb id="pg-28-359" n="28:359"/>there is no <hi rend="italic">bitterness</hi> in them, are soothed down by Time. And <hi rend="italic">your</hi> grief for your Mother must be altogether sweet and soft. For you must feel that you have always been a good son to her, that you have always appreciated her as she deserved, and that she knew this, and loved you to the last moment. How thankful we may be that you went when you did, in time to have the assurance of her love surviving all bodily weakness, made doubly sure to you by her last look and words. Oh what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would have given for <hi rend="italic">last words;</hi> to keep in my innermost heart all the rest of my Life&#x2014;but the words that awaited <hi rend="italic">me</hi> were; &#x201C;your Mother is <hi rend="small-caps">dead</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014; And I deserved it should so end&#x2014;I was not the dutiful child to my Mother that you have been to yours.</p>
<p>Strange that I should have passed that Sunday in such utter seclusion here&#x2014;as if in sympathy with what was going on there.</p>
<p>It is a great mercy you have had <hi rend="italic">some</hi> sleep. It will surely be a comfortable reflection for you in coming home this time, that you will look out over a perfectly empty hencourt,&#x2014;part of it even already pulled down, as all the rest, I dare say, will soon be. There are cocks enough in all directions, as poor Shuttleworth<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably not James Kay Shuttleworth (<date when="1804">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877">77</date>; <ref target="volume-28/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15199"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).</note> remarked; but none will plague you like these which had become a fixed idea, and a question, shall I, a man of Genius, or you &#x201C;a sooty washerman&#x201C; be master here? If you would like to know the ultimate fate of the poultry; it was sold away to a Postman, who has &#x201C;a hobby for fowls,&#x201C; in Milman&#x2019;s Row.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified; Millman&#x2019;s Row, King&#x2019;s Rd. W.</note> I let them make what profit they could of their fowls&#x2014;for we had no <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to deprive them of them&#x2014;only the right of hummanity to have the people forced to do us a favour voluntarily for a suitable compensation. I am on terms of good neighbourhood now with all the Roncas except the old Laundress herself&#x2014;who &#x201C;took to her bed <hi rend="italic">nearly mad</hi>,&#x201C; the married daughter told me, &#x201C;at <hi rend="italic">lying under a penalty</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;She must leave the place&#x201C; she said&#x2014;&#x201C;her husband would sooner have died than broken his word, <hi rend="italic">when he had passed it</hi> and to be bound under a penalty&#x201C;!! I got quite sorry for the people so soon as I had got them in my power, and have done what I could to sooth them down.</p>
<p>Chorley has just brought me my money&#x2014;how absurd to plague you about <hi rend="italic">that</hi> at such a moment.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brookfield also visited Cheyne Row, and noted, <date when="1853-12-27">27 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;Walked to Carlyle&#x2019;s.

<p><salute>My dear Brother&#x2014;</salute>To-day comes the saddest news I ever sent you from this place; the sorrow you have no doubt long been anticipating: our good and beloved old Mother is gone from us; on this Earth we have no Mother. She died on Sunday last (the <date when="1853-12-25">25th</date>) at ten minutes past four in the afternoon; nothing else had been expected for many weeks and months; she had endured much suffering too (tho&#x2019; without any disease except old age), and was spent to the last thread of weakness, hardly could you fancy a weaker creature with life, with clear intellect and generous affection still left. The good Doctor was unwearied in his attendance, coming from Moffat once or twice a week this long while, and lately staying here nearly altogether. Jean and Mary alternated in their attendance for several months; for almost the last two, it had been chiefly Jean alone whom our Mother seemed to prefer, and who indeed alone of the two had strength sufficient either of body or mind: Jean <hi rend="italic">refused</hi> to be worn out, and has indeed stood with faithful, almost heroic affection to her task, in a loving manner well rewarded with love; looks greatly fatigued and excited, but I think will recover herself gradually without damage. I came from Chelsea hither only on Friday morning last, after great uncertainties as to what I ought to do,&#x2014;for I could ill move, and felt that I should be in the way here. It had long been signified expressly to our dear Mother that if she gave the least sign of wish to me I could be with her in one day; but she was too magnanimous ever to express such a wish; and it was not till last week that I could fairly see I ought to go without delay. During the journey it became frightfully uncertain to me whether I should still find her alive; walking from Kirtlebridge where the morning early train had set me down, I durst ask nobody; I learned with certainty only when half-way up this stair-case. Thank God (as I may do for the rest of my life), my dear old Mother was still alive, still able with a perceptible joy to recognize me: her mind tho&#x2019; occasionally clouded with pain and extreme weakness, was there, as it had always been, and as it continued still more conspicuously to the end, <pb id="pg-28-361" n="28:361"/>clear, quietly nobly patient, simple and composed: her spirit, her very form of character and humour (for she occasionally spoke with a faint touch of <hi rend="italic">jocosity</hi>, in her old fashion even in late weeks) continued <hi rend="italic">entire</hi> to the very last, to a most singular degree; I likened it to a bit of sharp steel ground now to the very back, yet still the same steel in all respects, and with the same edge. Her weakness that Friday, after all I had heard so long, was almost beyond my expectation; she had a restless weary day, asleep and awake from minute to minute;&#x2014;mistook us several times; me once, &#x201C;did not know me at all,&#x201C; yet sent Jane out directly after (the good generous ever-loving Mother!) to bring me back with apologies, &#x201C;That I was Tom, that she knew me right weel.&#x201C; After midnight when I was retiring, she said as in old healthy days, &#x201C;Tell us how thou sleeps!&#x201C; Ah me, ah me! On the morrow, especially towards dusk and afterwards, she was visibly weaker; but her mind was steady and clear as it had ever been, indeed to a degree that still astonishes me. Struggling for breath (for she had not strength to take half an ordinary fill of the lungs, as John explained to us), she was in great suffering and distress for some hours; little sips of a kind of drink (&#x201C;give me a <hi rend="italic">spark</hi> of that thing&#x201C;), shifting of her posture; restlessly struggling (as seemed evident then) with the last enemy, in this condition she asked for Jean; heard that she was &#x201C;seeking up coals&#x201C; (from the old shed you will remember), and thereupon ordered John to &#x201C;hold the candle to the Window&#x201C; for light to Jean! Such a trait I never witnessed from any creature before; and there were others of the like which I shall remember with satisfaction as long as I live.&#x2014; Jean said she nightly heard her whispering her prayers all along; forgetting none of us, &#x201C;going round by America too now&#x201C; (as she sometimes would say, when speaking of it), nay not forgetting any public or general interest fit for prayer; and thinking only of herself and her own grandest interests as <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> and posterior to these. Oh my Brother, we are to be forever thankful to such a Mother! A pious dignity, a truth, affection, generosity, and simple valour and invincibility were in her, such as are given to only very few; and are a high and noble treasure, far above this world&#x2019;s wealth, to all connected with them.&#x2014; About midnight of Saturday, there being no relief visible anywhere, John ventured not without apprehension, on a small appliance (half her former quantity) of laudanum, in two portions; this very soon brought abatement. A little after midnight, John said to her, &#x201C;Here&#x2019;s Tom come to bid you good-night.&#x201C; She looked kindly at me, as she had done even in the worst pain, and she was now somewhat easier; I kissed her cold lips; and she took leave of me in these words, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m muckle obliged t&#x2019;ye,&#x201C; audibly whispered; which are forever memorable to me;&#x2014;which except a &#x201C;yes&#x201C; and a &#x201C;no&#x201C; in answer to questions from John about one and about four o&#x2019;clock, were the last she spoke in this world. For shortly after midnight, she fell asleep, slept ever deeper for sixteen hours; her look on Sunday morning and all day pointing gradually towards death as we sat by <pb id="pg-28-362" n="28:362"/>her: about 3.45 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi> the breathing rather suddenly sank fainter (it had never been harsh, nor was there any phlegm),&#x2014;paused once or twice, and then gently ceased; and she was with God. Amen, amen.&#x2014; My only consolation ever since is, the thought that she is freed forevermore from great bodily suffering; that she finished a life full of sorrows, but also full of worth, and such as only a few whom God loves can lead.&#x2014; This is what I had to write, dear Brother, not in good circumstances for imparting in a proper way such news to you. Please send the Letter forward to Jenny, to whom I will now write only the bare fact. The Funeral is to be to-morrow (Monday);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in <hi rend="italic">NL</hi>. TC means &#x201C;Thursday.&#x201C;</note> the weather is frosty with some snow. You will, after that, hear some humbler details about business, and have your consent asked to what the other three parties here shall think wisest to be done in that respect.&#x2014; I received from you duly what you wrote; <hi rend="italic">well</hi> that you rejected the Books.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Because, says A. Carlyle, &#x201C;an extortionate charge for carriage had been claimed.&#x201C;</note> <closer><salute>I hope to write soon again; and now bid God bless you!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Sister</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>This letter brings very sorrowful news to you, probably the sorrowfullest I may ever have to send from Scotsbrig. Our dear and good old Mother is no more: she went from us, gently and calmly at last, on the Sunday just gone (Christmas Day the <date when="1853-12-25">25th</date>) at four or ten minutes past four in the afternoon: The Dr., Jean, Isabella, Jamie, and I standing in sorrowful reverence at her bed-side; our poor suffering Mother had lain in a heavy kind of sleep for about 16 hours before; and died at last, rather unexpectedly to the watchers, so sudden was it, without struggle or seeming pain of any kind. We had to think &#x201C;Her sufferings are over; and she has fought her fight well and nobly; and as for us,&#x2014;we are left here alone; and the soul that never ceased to love us since we came into the world, is gone to God, her Maker and ours.&#x201C; This is the heavy news I have to send you, dear Sister; and nobody can spare you the sorrow and tears it will occasion. For above a year-and-a-half past, our dear Mother had been visibly falling fast away; when I saw her in <date when="1853-08">August</date> gone a year, her weakness and sufferings were quite painful to me; and it seemed uncertain whether we should ever meet again in this scene of things. She had <pb id="pg-28-363" n="28:363"/>no disease at that time nor afterwards, but the springs of life were worn out, there was no strength left. Within the last six months the decay proceeded faster and was constant: she could not much rise from bed; she needed Mary and Jean alternately to watch always over her,&#x2014;latterly it was Jean alone (Mary not being strong enough); and surely Jean has earned the gratitude of us all, and done a work that was blessed and beautiful, in so standing by her sacred task, and so performing it as she did. There has been no regular sleep to her for months past, often of late weeks and days not much sleep of any kind: but her affectionate patience, I think, never failed. I hope, though she is much worn out, she will not permanently suffer: and surely she will not want her reward. Our noble Mother too behaved like herself in all stages of her illness; never quailed into terror, lamentation or any weak temper of mind; had a wonderful clearness of intellect, clearness of heart, affection, piety and simple courage and beauty about her to the very end. She passed much of her time in the last weeks in a kind of sleep; used to awaken &#x201C;with a smile&#x201C; (as John described it to me), and has left a sacred remembrance with all of us consolatory in our natural grief.</p>
<p>I have written to Alick this day, a good many other details, and have bidden him send you the letter (which is larger and fuller than this),&#x2014;as you probably in asking for it will send this to him. I am in great haste, tomorrow (Thursday <date when="1853-12-29">29th Dec.</date>) being the funeral day, and many things occupying us still. I will therefore say no more here; your little pieces of worldly <hi rend="italic">business</hi> will, I hope, be satisfactorily and easily adjusted before I return to Chelsea, and then it will be somebody&#x2019;s task (John&#x2019;s or mine) to write to you again. <closer><salute>For the present I will only bid, God bless you, dear sister, you and yours;&#x2014;and teach you to bear this great sorrow and bereavement (which is one chiefly to your heart, but to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> a blessed relief) in the way that is fit, and worthy of the brave and noble Mother we have had, but have not any longer.</salute></closer></p>

<p>I got here in time to be recognised, to be cheered with the sacred beauty of a devout and valiant soul&#x2019;s departure. God make me thankful for such a mother. God enable me to live more worthily of her in the years I may still <pb id="pg-28-364" n="28:364"/>have left. I must rally myself if I can for a new and sterner final epoch which I feel has now arrived for me. The last two years have been without action, worthless to me except for the final burning away of things that needed to be burnt.</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> you will get no letter tomorrow; therefore I write one word to say that your good little Note has come; that I am still well enough, and right well done to, in my solitude here;&#x2014;and have indeed hitherto, in my sorrowful mood, such a kind of real <hi rend="italic">Sabbath</hi> for these two days as has not for long been granted me in this confused pilgrimage of mine. It still seems likeliest I shall come on Saturday night; but it is not yet <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> fixed with me, tho&#x2019; left wholly to myself, nor do I quite know what were <hi rend="italic">best</hi> yet: but on Saturday <hi rend="italic">morning</hi> you are to expect distinct news as to that.</p>
<p>Last night Jamie and I walked thro&#x2019; the howling frost-wind, after dark, to Grahame&#x2019;s; found poor old Grahame and his Sister;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth.</note>&#x2014;a sad, almost shocking visit to me, and which only a clear necessity could have induced or justified. Poor Grahame is red-faced, fat, and stupid, vulgarly painful to me; his poor Sister, lamed with rheumatisms and perhaps palsies, is evidently in a dangerous and most sad state: it was a great relief to get out into the dark wind again. At nine we were here by appoint<hi rend="italic">t;</hi> half an hour after&#x2014; Ah me, ah me! But there is blessedness too in such sorrow as this is: let us try to be <hi rend="italic">worthy</hi> of it; not to profane a sacredness such as there is no other.</p>
<p>The wind howled fiercely all night, and today, as I anticipated, there has snow fallen,&#x2014;as yet not much.</p>
<p>To you I am rather consoled in writing: but it is a real misery to me, this obligation of writing to others, to <hi rend="italic">any</hi> other (I can truly say). I have had to write <hi rend="italic">long</hi> details to Alick, short to Jenny, Erskine was missed yesterday; and so my good day is quite spent.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Jeannie; write again if it is not too much of a task to you: till Saturday morning <hi rend="italic">here</hi> (10 o&#x2019;clock at Middlebie, 4&#xBD; of Friday at Chelsea) you are safe; and any word from you is a comfort to me. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> now, for the Post-time is come.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Thanks for <hi rend="italic">two</hi> letters Dear.</salute> And excuse a short one in return. I did not get up till eleven today; having been ill all the night and all yesterday, with something new, and &#x201C;rather exquisite&#x201C;&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">colic</hi> Perhaps what they call the <hi rend="italic">Painters colic</hi>&#x2014;for I had thought it best <hi rend="italic">they</hi> should go on, since you were away, and complete their work, so as not to trouble you again; and the smell had been very strong of late days. Or perhaps it was the sickness I brought away from the Grange <hi rend="italic">doing itself out when it had the leisure</hi>. Whatever the cause, it could not have <hi rend="italic">timed</hi> itself better, than when I was all alone; with nothing else to do. I am now suffering only from the remedies I give myself&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">plenty</hi> of tincture of rhubarb and henbane&#x2014; So it is not <hi rend="italic">illness</hi> necessitates brevity. The Carpenter has been here this week finishing the cloth doors and shutters&#x2014; Yesterday I was to have provided some sort of stuff for covering the chairs, which are come home from the French-polisher; but I failed thro&#x2019; this colic; and now he (the Carpenter) sends me word that he will be at a stand for work in an hour or so&#x2014; There is no choice then but to let him go away or put myself in an omnibus and go up to Waterloo House<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nr. Charing Cross.</note> for the stuff. And if I delay writing till my return I should probably miss the post altogether&#x2014;for the only <hi rend="italic">three</hi> times I have been out since I came home I have been <hi rend="italic">up</hi> to nothing on coming in but lying <hi rend="italic">down</hi>.</p>
<p>Do you know, Dear, I dont like your always saying you are &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">well</hi>&#x201C; in health. Nobody gets <hi rend="italic">really</hi> well in that sudden way; and so you can only be feeling bodily well, either because your mind is so overfilled with sorrow, that you have not a minute to <hi rend="italic">listen to your sensations;</hi> or, because you are in a <hi rend="italic">fever of billiousness</hi> which passes with one for <hi rend="italic">wellness</hi>,&#x2014;till the reaction comes. I knew that Isabella would make you more comfortable than you are ever made in any other house&#x2014; She is indeed the kindest and <hi rend="italic">politest</hi> Hostess <hi rend="italic">I</hi> ever fell in with. My kindest regards to her and Jamie&#x2014;</p>
<p>Chapman has given me a check for 20&#xa3; and is desirous of printing <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi> immediately.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall pbd. TC&#x2019;s essay &#x201C;Burns&#x201C; (first pbd., <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, 48 (<date when="1828-12">Dec. 1828</date>): 267&#x2013;312) in their &#x201C;Reading for Travellers&#x201C; series early in <date when="1854">1854</date>; price, one shilling.</note> &#x201C;It is time now to spread a little more <hi rend="italic">salt</hi> of Carlyle over the thing.&#x201C; He said you had a tornup copy. Shall I send him <hi rend="italic">Burns?</hi> and where shall I find it? If you come on Saturday night you will find the Painters cleared out. They certainly <hi rend="italic">will</hi> have done on Saturday. The new room is much better <pb id="pg-28-366" n="28:366"/>painted than the Drawingroom&#x2014; We had a heavy fall of snow yesterday which is still lying</p>
<p>Could you not manage to sleep at Chatham Street<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Liverpool.</note> on your way back? I am sure Sophy would be most glad to see you and Alick is there now. You might warn her of your coming 100 Chatham Street</p>

<p>No letter for me today; which was a kind of disappointment: and I cannot get home tomorrow; it will not be till Monday (about midnight) that I can come. But <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, you may expect me.</p>
<p>I am well enough in health; get, one way and other, fully my average of sleep; and after tomorrow noon, I shall be <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, with liberty to roam abroad in the solitary places; and wind up in such composure as I can this stern and sacred Sabbath-week I have had.</p>
<p>Yesterday was full of misery and oppression to me, as natural; a grim ever-memorable day. No tear visited my eyes; my heart held very many in it. Today there has been a parting of the mournful lot of remnants <hi rend="italic">she</hi> has done with in this world: John presided over it all morning, I holding quite aloof; at length towards afternoon it became evident that to finish it this night at all, I must intervene. It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> now all but done; Jack is off, only Mary and Jean now here.&#x2014; I have had to eat my Dinner (at 5 o&#x2019;clock) without any walk; mean now to walk to Ecclefechan with this and return for tea&#x2014;</p>
<p>A little mahogany <hi rend="italic">medical</hi> thing that once belonged to your Father, and was sent hither but never used here, returns to you;&#x2014;also a green Bottle which was once old Grandfather Walter&#x2019;s:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Welsh (<date when="1752">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832">1832</date>), JWC&#x2019;s maternal grandfather; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 122&#x2013;30.</note> that shall be set aside here (if I cannot carry it), and kept safe either for my Jeannie or one of her Cousins.</p>
<p>Yesterday the very snow rang as we slowly wended thro&#x2019; it. I took a long walk about 9 at night: there was then, and thro&#x2019; night afterwards, <hi rend="italic">thaw;</hi> but at morning &#x26; now the iron frost was more intense than ever. Pray Heaven there may <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a letter for me tomorrow: I have little chance of any, if not then. <closer><salute>God bless thee</salute></closer></p>

Pbd: Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:238&#x2013;42. &#x201C;No. 6 Cheyne Row was, if I recollect, the joint property of two brothers, &#x2018;Martin&#x2019; their name, one of whom had fallen imbecile, and could, or at least did give no authority for outlay on the house, which had in consequence fallen quite into disrepair, and been let to this Ronca with his washing tubs, poultries, and mechanic sons-in-law, and become intolerable as a neighbourhood. Poor Ronca was not a bad man, though a misguided (&#x2018;Irish Fanny,&#x2019; a Catholic like the rest of them, was thought to have done mischief in the matter); but clear it was, at any rate that on him (alone of all London specimens), soft treatment, never so skilful, so graceful, or gentle, could produce no effect whatever. But now wise appliance of the hard, soon brought him to new insight; and he had to knuckle and comply in all points. In a few days, my guardian genius saw herself completely victorious; the Ronca annoyances, Ronca himself in three months, &#x26;c., &#x26;c. Neighbour Chalmers, great in parochialities, did his best. The very house-agent was touched to the heart by such words (one Owlton, whom I never saw, but have ever since thanked), and this tragic <hi rend="italic">canaillerie</hi> too had an end. As all here has&#x2014;all&#x2014;but not the meaning and first of all! Thou blessed one, no.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>Ever since I received your note by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A cousin of the Welsh family&#x2014;one of the Hunters&#x201C; (note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>). Janet Hunter, m. Dr. Pringle, Lann Hall, Tynron, nr. Thornhill.</note> I have been meaning to write to you&#x2014;yet always waited for &#x201C;a more <hi rend="italic">cheerful</hi> season,&#x201C; and now here is newyear&#x2019;s day at hand, and my regular letter due, and the season is not more cheerful, and besides I am full of business; owing to the sudden movements of the last two weeks; and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s absence; leaving me <hi rend="italic">his</hi> affairs to look after as well as my own.</p>
<p>We went to the Grange (Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s) in the beginning of <date when="1853-12">December</date> to stay till after Xmas. I was very glad to get into the Country for a while, and have nothing to do but dress dolls for a Xmas Tree&#x2014;for the last months had quite worn me out. I had had nothing but building and painting for so long. varied with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s outbursts against the &#x201C;infernal cocks&#x201C; next door. which had made our last addition of a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Silent Apartment</hi>&#x201C; necessary, Alas! and the silent apartment had turned out the noisiest apartment in the House! and the <hi rend="italic">cocks</hi> still crowed and the <hi rend="italic">Macaw</hi> still shrieked! and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C still stormed! at the Grange I should at least escape <hi rend="italic">all that</hi> for the time being I thought. The first two days I felt in Paradise, and so <hi rend="italic">well!</hi> the third day I smashed my forehead against a marble slab&#x2014;raised a lump the size of a hen&#x2019;s egg on it, and gave a shock to my nerves that quite unfitted me for company&#x2014; But I struggled on amongst the <hi rend="italic">eighteen other visitors</hi>, better or worse, till at the end of <pb id="pg-28-368" n="28:368"/>a fortnight I was recovered except for a slight lump <hi rend="italic">still</hi> visible&#x2014; When M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C came to me one morning, all of a sudden, and told me I must go up to London myself, and take charge of some business&#x2014;nothing less than trying to <hi rend="italic">take</hi> the adjoining house ourselves, on the chance of <hi rend="italic">letting</hi> it, and get our disobliging neighbours turned out; and there being but six days till Christmas (the time for giving them notice to quit) of course despatch was required; especially as the owner of the house lived away in Devonshire&#x2014; I thought it a most wildgoose enterprize I was sent on, and when Lady Ashburton and the others asked him why he sent poor me instead of going himself, and he coolly answered&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should only spoil the thing&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">she</hi> is sure to manage it.&#x201C; it provoked me the more&#x2014; I was so sure I could not manage it. But he was quite right&#x2014; Before the week was out I had done better than take a house we did not need&#x2014;for I had got the people bound down legally &#x201C;under a penalty of 10&#xa3; and of immediate notice to quit, never to keep or allow to be kept, fowls or Macaws or other nuisance on these premises.&#x201C; in consideration of 5&#xa3; given to them by M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2014;I had the lease of the house and the <hi rend="italic">notice to quit</hi> lying at my disposition but the threat having served the end I had no wish to turn the people out. You may fancy what I had suffered thro the effects of these nuisances on M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, when I tell you that, on having this agreement put in my hand by their house agent<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mr. Owlton.</note> I&#x2014;burst into tears!&#x2014;and should have kissed the man if he had not been so <hi rend="italic">ugly!</hi> Independently of the success of my diplomacy about the <hi rend="italic">cocks</hi> I was very thankful I happened to be sent home just then&#x2014;otherwise I should have got the news of my Cousin Helen&#x2019;s death in a houseful of company. It was shock enough to get it here&#x2014; I had received a long letter from herself a day or two before leaving the Grange, in which she told me she was unusually well. and the night after my return I had sat till after midnight answering it&#x2014; Two hours after it had gone to the post office came Mary&#x2019;s letter announcing her death&#x2014;and the same day came M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C who had suddenly taken the resolution to go to Scotsbrig and see his Mother once more&#x2014;John&#x2019;s letter indicating that she was dying fast. I hurried him off all I could for I was terrified he would arrive to find her dead&#x2014;and he was just in time. He writes he will probably be home tomorrow night&#x2014; It has been a continuous miracle for me M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> C living till now after the state I saw her in last <date when="1853-07">July</date>&#x2014; But poor Helen Welsh! One has to think hard that she had a deadly disease, with much suffering before her&#x2014;painful operations before her&#x2014;had she lived&#x2014;to reconcile oneself to losing her so suddenly.</p>

<salute>Dear Friend,</salute>
<p>Your image has often enough been present with me here, amid the sad scenes now ended; and I will not let this memorable Week close without writing one other word to you.</p>
<p>All is now concluded; I come to Chelsea on Monday night; there to con as I may the stern and solemn lesson I have got. I feel as if a new epoch had begun for me; the final one,&#x2014;which it would well behove me to spend in a way worthier of the dead and of the living in whom I have the privilege to be interested. I have been and am very sad; but often, when left quite alone, not so miserable as I was wont.</p>
<p>Today they all go away, except one Brother who resides here: the latter half of this day, and the whole of tomorrow, I expect to spend nearly alone; which is in general the best method. We have iron frost, with a powdering of snow, the very snow jingling as one stirs it; skies as bright as diamond, and today no audible wind, only a silent steady current from the North,&#x2014;silence, brightness everywhere as of Eternity. I have great satisfaction in thinking of my Mother&#x2019;s last two days in this world, and of all her days here: a noble patriarchal dignity, far beyond that of Queens (who are <hi rend="italic">only</hi> queens), a perfect <pb id="pg-28-370" n="28:370"/>veracity, a beautiful simple courage, intelligence, and natural propriety and generosity characterised all her life, and were still singularly conspicuous (worn now, as it were, to a very thread, but still the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> in physiognomy) to the very end. God make me thankful for such a Mother; and teach me to be worthier of her, while my pilgrimage still lasts.</p>
<p>You were in this, as in all things you have been, very good to me, dear Lady; and it is a sign how much I esteem the intrinsic noble Self of you that I address you so from these scenes, in these hours. I know not well when we shall meet,&#x2014;to speak again a few obstructed words. <closer><salute>But I do value even that as I must and ought; and at all times my heart&#x2019;s best prayers are for blessings on you. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> today.&#x2014; Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Mrs. Johnstone,</salute>
<p>The accompanying Book was once a gift of mine to my Mother, that is now gone, and I cannot bear to take it back with me in present circumstances. Perhaps it may be of some slight use to you, at some time, or other: and I will ask you to accept it of me in memory of the lasting regard, and gratitude I bear to you in which the Departed was taught to share. Please do not trouble yourself in making any answer. I am just departing for <hi rend="italic">Chelsea</hi> and know not when I shall see Annandale again.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With blessings and good wishes in whatever part of God&#x2019;s Universe our respective places may be.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>I remain always your affec<hi rend="italic">e</hi> friend</salute></closer>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have just read your Letter; and am to answer, on the part of Jamie, that he will immediately attend to studying the execution of your culinary and other commands, and let you know when he sends the things or any of them.</p>
<p>On my own score I purposed to write you a word. This morning as I lay awake, thinking about many things, it struck me that perhaps the sending of <pb id="pg-28-371" n="28:371"/>that Book to Erskine with that inscription was questionable altogether,&#x2014;might have a touch of ostentation, which was very far from my purpose?&#x2014;at any rate that you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have to write a short Note to him, explaining how it was a Gift, and I could not bear to carry it back. Also to pay the carriage, and send me note of it.&#x2014; Or if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> liked any better to <hi rend="italic">cut out</hi> that fly-leaf of the Book, and make some other <hi rend="italic">more</hi> appropriate-looking use of it, or above all, to keep it for yourself,&#x2014;that surely w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very welcome to me. Only please do so <hi rend="italic">without</hi> consulting me; and only let me know the result when it is <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. I decided, after all, to send Mrs Johnston&#x2019;s Book, only writing a line or two of Note to explain. Decide, yourself, and perform.</p>
<p>There did come a Letter from Jane last night; belated by some neglect or other: all is still well enough. I am appointed to go by the 11&#xBC; train on Monday.</p>
<p>Jean and Mary have just got away; I walked forward with Jean to near the end of Middlebie; I put her in there, and took rather sad farewell (1&#xBE; p.m.). All was settled completely well; finished off to universal consent last night. Jean <hi rend="italic">leaves</hi> the Picture to Isabella; got &#xa3;4 for the Drawers, 10/6 for the mirror; owns the Clock (which is left here), and the 4 Prints of which she means to take 1 and leave 3.&#x2014; Everything was done in brotherly peace, &#x26; as was desired by you and me.</p>
<p>You will have a great <hi rend="italic">vacuum</hi> in your days for some time to come. The best news I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hear of you I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> reckon to be the recommenc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of your <hi rend="italic">Dante:</hi> a worthy work still left you. From Chelsea I will write. I bid you now many grateful farewells,&#x2014;grateful for many reasons of common interest to us, and for your patience and goodness to my poor self withal. <closer><salute>Farewell, &#x26; God&#x2019;s blessing on you, dear Brother, with kind regards to Phoebe: Yours ever affectionately</salute></closer> <name>T.
