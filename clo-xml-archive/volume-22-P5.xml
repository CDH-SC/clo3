<p>It is important to emphasize how much in these volumes is new to the study of the Carlyles.</p>
<p>First, indisputably, is the proportion of letters not published before. The present volumes contain 634 letters, of which 484 are by Thomas Carlyle and 150 by Jane. Of these, 51 percent appear for the first time, and, of the remainder, 16.4 percent of the full total have been seen only in an incomplete form. One hundred and forty-two letters, or 16.4 percent, can be found with some difficulty in earlier publications of the Carlyles&#x2019; letters, and nearly 8 percent have appeared only in journals, biographies, catalogues, and so on. The figures for Thomas on his own are similar, although a larger proportion have not been published before. In addition, although we are reaching the central point of Thomas&#x2019;s career, a greater proportion of material is new than in earlier volumes. Therefore, the year of the two-hundredth anniversary of Carlyle&#x2019;s birth gives an increasingly fresh opportunity to see why the Carlyles survive and to look at their circle and times.</p>
<p>In addition to the unpublished letters we have used other unpublished material, and are enjoying the growing accessibility of contemporary journalism and the entire range of letters to the Carlyles. The correspondence with Emerson connected with his visit in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> is not new, but came at a turning-point in their relations. These years also bring us dramatic letters about the Carlyles written by their friend Amalie B&#xF6;lte, almost a domestic spy at 5 Cheyne Row, which, surprisingly, have been totally unused by anyone writing about the Carlyles. Finally, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date> is the year when Thomas Carlyle first met his biographer James Anthony Froude. It is also the year he published an &#x201C;Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question&#x201C;; wrote the first of the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi>, &#x201C;The Present Time&#x201C;; and decided to undertake the life of his friend John Sterling. Jane Carlyle&#x2019;s old rivalry with Lady Harriet Baring (who became Lady Ashburton in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>) meanwhile continued to threaten disquiet.</p>
<p>In his writing, as in much else, Carlyle developed. His <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> was not entirely behind him, as he had to publish a third edition and take up the challenge of the forged letters thrust on him by William Squire. But it was a time dominated by revolution in Europe and the threat of Chartism at home to which Carlyle responded with a spate of journalism, mainly concerned not with Germany, Italy, and France, but with Ireland. He determinedly toured and wrote about Ireland in <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>, where so much that <pb id="pg-22-x" n="22:x"/>he had foretold, with keen insight rather than &#x201C;prophecy,&#x201C; was being fulfilled. Many of these aspects deserve more direct comment than can be slipped into separate footnotes.</p>
<p>Amalie B&#xF6;lte introduced herself to the Carlyles in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, when we might have noted more about her; but even now reference must simply be made to the Carlyles&#x2019; comments on her in the previous two sets of volumes (16&#x2013;21), and in the present one (<ref target="volume-22/lt-18470715-JWC-HW-01"><sic>22:17</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1847-07-15">15 July 1847</date></corr></ref>). In fact much more has come to light about B&#xF6;lte through her letters to Varnhagen von Ense, which were captured in <date when="1945-00-00">1945</date> and now are in the Jagiellonian University Library, Cracow. From these letters full excerpts dealing mainly with the Carlyles were edited by Professor Walther Fischer and Dr. Antje Behrens, in <hi rend="italic">Amaly B&#xF6;ltes Briefe aus England an Varnhagen von Ense (<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>)</hi> (D&#xfc;sseldorf, <date when="1955-00-00">1955</date>), from notes made as early as <date when="1916-00-00">1916</date>. With the generous help of Professor N. A. Furness of Edinburgh we have translated from the published excerpts in our own notes, and reference has been made to Varnhagen&#x2019;s replies in his <hi rend="italic">Briefe an Eine Freundin [</hi>i.e. B&#xF6;lte<hi rend="italic">]. Aus den Jahren <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date></hi> (Hamburg, <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), the originals of which are untraced. The <hi rend="italic">Saturday Review</hi> (<date when="1860-08-25">25 August 1860</date>) deplored the edition, noting that B&#xF6;lte &#x201C;appears to have been living in Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s family, and to have sedulously hived up for the amusement of her old Friend in Berlin&#x201C; the gossip and opinions of his circle. It said more to the same effect, disapproving of Varnhagen&#x2019;s liberalism and expressing dismay that any future visiting young German lady would be &#x201C;shunned in society like a leper or a police spy.&#x201C; The review was exaggerated, but friends such as Charlotte Williams Wynn entirely sympathized with the Carlyles.</p>
<p>Varnhagen&#x2019;s printed letters may have been expurgated but B&#xF6;lte&#x2019;s are frank, both praising and criticizing Carlyle. We need to allow for their immediate and personal nature, her own radicalism, the rather difficult position she was in, and her spitfire independence. Rosemary Ashton, in her <hi rend="italic">Little Germany: Exile and Asylum in Victorian England</hi> (Oxford, <date when="1986-00-00">1986</date>), finds B&#xF6;lte insecure, resentful, and touchy (pp. 212&#x2013;17), as no doubt she was. Like many others B&#xF6;lte had been drawn to Jane. Writing to Varnhagen on sending him Jane&#x2019;s letter to her of <date when="1845-11-26">26 November 1845</date> (see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451126-JWC-AB-01"><sic>20:64&#x2013;65</sic><corr>JWC to AB, <date when="1845-11-26">26 Nov. 1845</date></corr></ref>), she declared that it would show him &#x201C;what a rare woman has been granted to this man&#x2014;a woman in whom the highest intellectual refinement and strength of character are combined with the most delicate femininity, and the deepest, warmest emotion.&#x2014; All his friends appreciate her greatly, and her wit and intellect are almost, and often even a greater attraction than the profundity of her husband&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 37, trans.).</p>
<p>Already in <date when="1846-02-00">February 1846</date>, B&#xF6;lte had roused Carlyle to speak &#x201C;for hours&#x201C; about Frederick the Great (p. 39). She found him brilliant but obstinate and delighted in telling him that he laid down the law for others without <pb id="pg-22-xi" n="22:xi"/>following it himself (p. 41). When the Carlyles were away, she longed for his return, but, once back, she wrote:</p>
<q>It pains me to discover, gradually, that his books are everything and their author nothing. Nor can I discover a single virtue in him, no sense of the beautiful, the good. He writes for humanity and human beings mean nothing to him. He hates the aristocracy and worships an aristocrat. He talks of the freedom of nations, and wants to rule them all with a sword&#x2026;. Today he builds a temple to one idea right up to the clouds, only to tear it down tomorrow. It is always paradoxes that he offers, and because he alone defends them, and is never contradicted, he is always one-sided&#x2026;. But I am on such good terms with his wife, that I am there almost every day. (p. 43)</q>
<p>Jane in fact often found her tiresome, and in B&#xF6;lte&#x2019;s next letter she and Carlyle were &#x201C;the best of friends. &#x2026; He spun me the yarn for hours,&#x201C; and was &#x201C;very witty and agreeable&#x201C; (p. 44). &#x201C;London is miserable&#x201C; when &#x201C;Carlyle is in Scotland&#x201C; (p. 47). Her disapproval of his liking for some of the aristocracy came from her own radicalism and discomfort as a governess. She enjoys standing up to her hero. They accepted each other&#x2019;s teasing with uproarious laughter, and in general their relationship was a sound one.</p>
<p>Autographs that she and the Carlyles collected were often letters sent to the Carlyles from <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> to <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>, to which Thomas frequently added his comments, and were sent to Varnhagen von Ense for his great collection, once in the Royal Library at Berlin but now at Cracow. It should be possible to include some of the later ones in their proper chronological place and to write a separate account of the rest.</p>
<p>B&#xF6;lte was probably right to find Carlyle a man of paradoxes, which may make us think him almost heroic in his attempt to learn the facts about Ireland, look famine in the face, and actually listen to all sides of the question. Froude talks of Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences of My Irish Journey</hi> as noted hurriedly on his return, hastily given away, and forgotten as valueless. But Carlyle always put his travel journals aside once they had been used to define his experience. He chose to travel in the company of Gavan Duffy, recently tried four times for treason, and for whom we now have Carlyle&#x2019;s eloquent appeal to the Viceroy when Duffy was under trial (<ref target="volume-23/lt-18481027-TC-LC-01"><sic>23:143&#x2013;46</sic><corr>TC to LC, <date when="1848-10-27">27 Oct. 1848</date></corr></ref>), just as we have Carlyle&#x2019;s powerful letter on behalf of the more militantly revolutionary John Mitchel, for whom he continued to retain an affection (<ref target="volume-23/lt-18480526-TC-LC-01"><sic>23:35&#x2013;37</sic><corr>TC to LC, <date when="1848-05-26">26 May 1848</date></corr></ref>). His visits of <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date> and <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date> were etched on his mind, taking a different form in his &#x201C;Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question&#x201C;: &#x201C;What is to be done? asks every one&#x201C; of Ireland. &#x201C;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Blacklead</hi> those 2 million idle beggars,&#x2019; I sometimes advised, &#x2018;and sell them in Brazil as <pb id="pg-22-xii" n="22:xii"/>Niggers!&#x2019;&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-24/lt-18490813-TC-RWE-01"><sic>24:193</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1849-08-13">13 Aug. 1849</date></corr></ref>). Memories of his visits reappeared in the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi>, and may have helped to confirm his choice of a new work in Frederick. It was a time he never forgot, when he turned to the supreme place of suppuration in Europe, and presumably no one now wants to deride him for failing to find a cure.</p>
<p>It was more effective than his performance over the forgeries proffered him by William Squire. Once more, these have been played down or unexamined by most biographers, but leave us with an uneasy doubt of Carlyle&#x2019;s judgment once he grew tired of a subject, as he had with the later editions of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell.</hi> Once again, Froude, silent on the subject, was undoubtedly not only aware that Carlyle&#x2019;s inclusion of Squire&#x2019;s &#x201C;Thirty-Five New Letters of Oliver Cromwell&#x201C; in an article and then in the third edition of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> had been authoritatively challenged, but also he must have sensed that Carlyle himself was beginning to suspect that they were dubious, and so fraudulent. But there has been a long-running biographical economy with the truth. The whole story is nonsense unless it is seen how cleverly Squire baited his copied letters and dangled them before Carlyle, who refused to budge from his book-lined study and escaped any penalty of exposure by stout denial and some self-deception.</p>
<p>Yet we owe much to Froude for his cleverness, narrative ability, and grasp of some essentials of Carlyle&#x2019;s life, even if he is not to be trusted with the last word. He remembered his first visit to Cheyne Row in <date when="1849-06-00">June 1849</date> more vividly than much else about the Carlyles, though it was passed over in their letters:</p>
<q>He was then fifty-four years old; tall (about five feet eleven), thin, but at that time upright, with no signs of the later stoop. &#x2026; His head was extremely long, with the chin thrust forward; the neck was thin; the mouth firmly closed, the under lip slightly projecting; the hair grizzled and thick and bushy. His eyes, which grew lighter with age, were then of a deep violet, with fire burning at the bottom of them, which flashed out at the least excitement. The face was altogether more striking, most impressive every way. And I did not admire him the less because he treated me&#x2014;I cannot say unkindly, but shortly and sternly. &#x2026;</q>
<q>We went afterwards into the dining-room, where Mrs. Carlyle gave us tea. Her features were not regular, but I thought I had never seen a more interesting&#x2014;looking woman. Her hair was raven black, her eyes dark, soft, sad, with dangerous light in them. Carlyle&#x2019;s talk was rich, full, and scornful; hers delicately mocking. (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:459)</q>
<p>What grows more immediate in these years is the way in which the Old <pb id="pg-22-xiii" n="22:xiii"/>Testament tones of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> and some of the earlier works is partly replaced by Carlyle&#x2019;s skepticism. He wrote cautiously of his mother&#x2019;s leaning to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Semitic</hi> side of things&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-22/lt-18470917-TC-JWC-01"><sic>22:77</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1847-09-17">17 Sept. 1847</date></corr></ref>) and about old friends in the Borders as sunk in Hebraic Calvinism, &#x201C;the dreary abysses of Old-Jewhood and Old Genevahood&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-22/lt-18470929-TC-JWC-01"><sic>22:98</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1847-09-29">29 Sept. 1847</date></corr></ref>); he clearly shook W. E. Forster and disturbed Tennyson and Emerson, who felt confronted by his &#x201C;utmost impatience of Christendom &#x26; Jewdom &#x2026; plainly biding his time, &#x26; meditating how to undermine &#x26; explode the whole world of nonsense which torments him&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-22/lt-18471028-JWC-LHB-01"><sic>22:140</sic><corr>JWC to LHB, <date when="1847-10-28">28 Oct. 1847</date></corr></ref>). Carlyle recognized his own hatred of the institutionalized belief in an Old Testament faith, which was bound up with wanting to peel off &#x201C;fetid <hi rend="italic">Jewhood</hi> in every sense from myself&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-22/lt-18470831-TC-RWE-01"><sic>22:48&#x2013;49</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1847-08-31">31 Aug. 1847</date></corr></ref>) and in which a &#x201C;liberal&#x201C; demand for truth is tainted with a degree of antiSemitism born of frustrated longing to release yet another book about what he calls the &#x201C;Exodus from Houndsditch&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-24/lt-18490416-TC-JSB-01"><sic>24:24</sic><corr>TC to JSB, <date when="1849-04-16">16 April 1849</date></corr></ref>). But it is mainly the Judeo-Christian faith he scorns, not the race.</p>
<p>He had not altogether changed: we can trace in the letters for some years his growing exasperation; it will be impossible to escape it after the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets;</hi> and Ireland had just shown him a land in which he thought there was no religion corresponding to reality; so that, if we are to understand him, it may be necessary to read back some of this suppressed skepticism into earlier works. Already Cheyne Row was being seen as a rallying place by younger heretics, like Arthur Hugh Clough (see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451217-TC-AHC-01"><sic>20:76</sic><corr>TC to AHC, <date when="1845-12-17">17 Dec. 1845</date></corr></ref>; <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490403-TC-JWC-01"><sic>24:6</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1849-04-03">3 April 1849</date></corr></ref>). The Rev. Thomas Wilson, for example, vicar of St. Peter Mancroft, Norwich, must have been in touch with Carlyle at this time. After giving up his living in <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>, unable to accept the Thirty-nine Articles, he was &#x201C;Reverentially and Affectionately&#x201C; to dedicate his <hi rend="italic">Catholicity Spiritual and Intellectual</hi> (<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>) to Carlyle as &#x201C;an Example of Transcendant Genius Hallowed by the Purest Life and Worthiest Work.&#x201C; For it was seen that Carlyle stood for skeptical honesty, which is why James Spedding came to see him with Froude after the latter&#x2019;s ejection as a tutor from Exeter College (<ref target="volume-24/lt-18490404-TC-JF-01"><sic>24:13</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1849-04-04">4 April 1849</date></corr></ref>), and why Anthony Sterling wanted Carlyle to write a more truthful account of his brother&#x2019;s life than the Rev. Julius Hare&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Memoir</hi> claiming him for the church. We often hear the apocryphal story of Clough&#x2019;s farewell to Emerson, on his embarking for Boston in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>, when Clough said that Carlyle had led his followers out &#x201C;into the desert, and &#x2026; left us there&#x201C; (see Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 42&#x2013;43), as if this were meant as a reproach. It is an alluring figure of speech, but it equally means that this was where they had chosen to follow him.</p>
<p>As regards Emerson, Carlyle hardly does himself justice in some of his accounts; in fact, their friendship was to survive the arrival of the American apostle of reasonableness and detachment on his doorstep, his appeal to <pb id="lastpage-22-xiv" n="22:xiv"/>many of Carlyle&#x2019;s own followers, and even his lecturing at Exeter Hall in complete independence of or contradiction to what his friend had been saying.</p>
<p>In many such ways Carlyle was speaking in a new tone or in new voices, which may have come as a surprise after he had been concealing himself under the cloak of history.</p>
<p>All the Carlyles&#x2019; letters, as Thomas told his sister, represent &#x201C;an hour,&#x201C; now and then, snatched from &#x201C;the gulph, as it were by the hair of the head&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-23/lt-18480719-TC-JCA-01"><sic>23:74</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1848-07-19">19 July 1848</date></corr></ref>); but some hours and letters have been saved.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Sir</salute>,&#x2014;Unluckily it is not possible to answer your main inquiry. The incomes of literary men even of a high reputation vary, according as the men work for popularity by itself, or for other objects, from 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year to perhaps 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or lower. Add to which that all such incomes are uncertain, fluctuating on the wildest chance, and that not one literary man in the hundred ever becomes popular or successful at all. You perceive it is like asking what may be the income of a man that shall decide to live by gambling. No answer to be given. Reporters to the daily papers, whose industry is the humblest of all real or <hi rend="italic">un</hi>servile kinds in literature, receive, as I have heard, about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year. Perhaps, all things considered, a man of sense, reduced to live by writing, would decide that, in the economical respect, these men&#x2019;s position was actually the best. By quitting reality again, and taking in to some popular department of literary <hi rend="italic">rope-dancing</hi>, a person of real toughness and assiduity, not ashamed to feel himself a slave, but able even to think himself <hi rend="italic">free</hi> and a king in rope-dancing <hi rend="italic">well paid</hi>, contrives, with moderate talent otherwise, if he be really tough and assiduous, to gain sometimes considerable wages; in other cases dies of heartbreak, drinking, and starvation. That really is his economic position, so far as I have seen it. But for a man really intent to do <hi rend="italic">a man&#x2019;s work</hi> in literature in these times, I should say that even with the highest talent he might have to be fed oftentimes like Elijah, by the ravens;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Kings 17:6.</note> and if his talent, though real, was not very high, he might easily see himself cut off from wages altogether; all men saying to him, &#x2018;The thing you have to offer us is, in the supply and demand market, worth nothing whatever.&#x2019; Such a man as that latter, if he could live at all, I should account him lucky.</p>
<p>This, my generous young friend, this is the sad No answer I have to give you&#x2014;a sad but a true one. The advice I ground on it you already discover&#x2014;Not by any means to quit the solid paths of practical business for these inane froth oceans which, however gas-lighted they may be, are essentially what I have called them somewhere, base as Fleet Ditch, the mother of dead dogs.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. The Fleet was a sewer, so-called from the brook running from Holborn into the Thames at Blackfriars Bridge; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320110-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:87</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-10">10 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> Surely it is better for a man to <hi rend="italic">work</hi> out his God-given faculty than merely to speak it out, even in the most Augustan times. Surely of all <pb id="pg-22-4" n="22:4"/>places in this planet the place where the gods do most need a working man of genius is Manchester, a place sunk in sordid darkness of every kind except the glitter of gold, and which, if it were once irradiated, might become one of the beautifullest things this sun has ever seen.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Your Letter came three days ago: after John too had <pb id="pg-22-5" n="22:5"/>read your news, it was instantly sent off to Scotsbrig, where our good Mother, who is come thither again from Dumfries, would also be gratified with hearing of your welfare.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John (Jack) Aitken Carlyle (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4694"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), TC&#x2019;s second brother, trained as a physician but no longer practicing, living mainly in London but often in Scotland; he had just completed a trans. of Dante&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi>, to be pbd. by Chapman &#x26; Hall, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>. Margaret Carlyle, b. Aitken (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), TC&#x2019;s mother, living with her youngest son James (Jamie) (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890-00-00">90</date>), a farmer at Scotsbrig, Ecclefechan, m. to Isabella, b. Calvert (d. <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>).</note> They have not written to us very copiously since our Mother left Dumfries: but two days ago, there was a short Note from Isabella, which reported generally that all was well. Our Mother was in her usual health and spirits, she informed us, doing very well at Scotsbrig: Jenny, one of whose <foreign>bairns</foreign> being unwell had detained her at Dumfries,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet (Jenny) Hanning (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1898-00-00">98</date>), TC&#x2019;s youngest sister, separated from her husband, Robert Hanning (d. <date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>), who had emigrated to Canada, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; now living at Maxwelltown, Dumfries, and supported in part by TC and John Carlyle. Her das. were Margaret (b. <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>) and Mary (b. <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>).</note> was to come over now shortly, and rejoin our Mother; which would be suitable for both. Except this general intimation that all went in the common course, there was no news: considerable dearth still, but crops looking well, railway to be opened as far as Beattock<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Annandale, ca. 19 mi. from Ecclefechan; the line came from Carlisle.</note> &#x201C;in <date when="1847-08-00">August</date>,&#x201C; Jamie busy with sheep &#x26;c:&#x2014;in fact, all going on as when you last heard; which negative news we are to take thankfully as <hi rend="italic">good</hi>. Here too it is the same. Jack is now about getting some part of his Translation of Dante <hi rend="italic">printed</hi>, which will take the thing off his hand, and be a real advantage on that side, tho&#x2019; as he is to get no money for it, little other advantage is visible in the business. So soon as he gets his Printers<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robson, Levey, &#x26; Franklyn, Gt. New St., Fetter Lane.</note> fairly set to work, I suppose he will return to Scotsbrig, as cheaper quarters; which our good Mother too will like. As for Jane and me we have not determined on any <hi rend="italic">outrake</hi> [excursion] for the autumn: but I suppose in general that a little glimpse of Scotsbrig may be my natural destination. I grow yearly a <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> traveller; and if I have need of travelling at this time, I regard such need as a real misfortune. I have taken to no outward <hi rend="italic">work</hi> yet; and do not see any very <hi rend="italic">near</hi> me yet, tho&#x2019; my mind is getting heavier with the feeling of endless work to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> done,&#x2014;to be struggled at, so long as I live.&#x2014; By the bye, I had a letter from Mr Greig, informing me that he had duly sent off by a private gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (whom he named) your copy of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Second edn., 3 vols. (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>). John Greig (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), Scottish-born lawyer and banker, Canandaigua, N.Y.; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360205-TC-AC-01"><sic>8:297</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1836-02-05">5 Feb. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> very sorry that it had never come, he would take strict order &#x26;c: by and by, I should think, you <pb id="pg-22-6" n="22:6"/>were sure of the Book. If it do not come shortly, you had better write to Mr Greig, and appoint some shop or public place in Brantford (the Post-Office, for instance?) where the Parcel could be certainly left for you.</p>
<p>We were delighted, dear Brother, to hear of your wholesome industries; of your planting Appletrees, and other solid labours. By all means, complete your orchard; it is a beautiful duty that of planting fruit-trees; and a blessed one, especially when you can hope your children will pluck the fruit! And get the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> trees you can; that will prove to be the real thrift at last. And train the children, each in its own little garden, to respect fruit-trees, honourable profit, <hi rend="italic">industry, beauty</hi> and <hi rend="italic">good order:</hi> it is the summary of all Gospels to man! I have bought 3 fruit-trees and put them in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> poor sooty patch of garden; the old ones, the work of some good man 150 years ago, having died or needed to be torn out: <hi rend="italic">one</hi> pear and <hi rend="italic">one</hi> cherry, for this year, seem to be all <hi rend="italic">our</hi> promise of fruit-harvest; but some poor hungry Cockney in another generation may do better.&#x2014; Jane and I, for our share, were hugely amused at your application of <hi rend="italic">gunpowder</hi> to the old immovable oak logs! An excellent invention indeed. With a wimble you can sink the physic into the very heart of them; and the most gnarled monster of a block will, with one roar, obey you, and go its ways, when the match-paper acts! I think they ought to make it general, that plan, in the Canada woods. Only take care <hi rend="italic">to be well out of the range</hi>, when your shot goes off! This really is to be attended to; and I should be most afraid of you in that respect.</p>
<p>Your Purchase of the 40 acres was partly expected by us here. We cannot judge of the wisdom of it: but as you did it with all your sagacity summoned to the inquiry, we cannot but hope it will do well. Nothing in the world seems more certain than that all Canada, and that Bield in particular, will and must <hi rend="italic">increase</hi> yearly in value: whoever <hi rend="italic">can</hi> stick to his place there, like a patient, valiant man, he <hi rend="italic">in</hi>fallibly will find his place fruitful for him. May Bield, and this new Purchase, be blessed to our Brother and our Brother&#x2019;s heirs!&#x2014; The instant your Letter came, Jack and I despatched the due order for 800 dollars to Adamson at Dumfries;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Adamson (d. <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>), manager of the Dumfries branch of the British Linen Bank; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380214-TC-JA-01"><sic>10:23</sic><corr>TC to JA, <date when="1838-02-14">14 Feb. 1838</date></corr></ref>. But the deal did not go through; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470903-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1847-09-03">3 Sept.</date></ref></note> with injunction to be <hi rend="italic">swift</hi>, that he might save the Post-Steamer (of <hi rend="italic">Today</hi>). Adamson, as you will see by this Note received from him yesterday, has done the business; tho&#x2019; it was not, at first very clear to us <hi rend="italic">how</hi>: but we now perceive, you are to receive from Adamson by this same Post, a <hi rend="italic">Letter of Credit</hi> on the Bankers Smith, Payne &#x26; [Co of] London:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Smith, Payne &#x26; Smith, 1 Lombard St., City.</note> this Letter of Credit you take to <hi rend="italic">any</hi> respectable Bank in Canada (or perhaps it mentions <hi rend="italic">some</hi> special Bank?); and they will <pb id="pg-22-7" n="22:7"/>give you 800 dollars for it. I hope and believe it is all right. But if you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get the Letter of Credit, or if anything else in it be wrong, you must write immediately to &#x201C;R. Adamson Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Dumfries,&#x201C; and demand remedy: one thing is very certain, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has already got the money into his hands here, and is bound to put it safe into yours.&#x2014; For the rest, it were surely wise to look strictly after these &#x201C;rights and titles&#x201C; before you part with your cash. To consult some good Lawyer, or otherwise known and responsible man, if you have any doubt about it? Of course doubts <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be removed, by asking in the right quarter. And so enough of that affair; which, we hope, you will tell us by return of the Steamer, is all settled and off your hands,&#x2014;and the acres safe <hi rend="italic">into</hi> your hands.</p>
<p>Dear Brother, I am at the end of my time today; and must not write any more. You have got, I believe, what is essential; and my hurry at present is very great.&#x2014; They are printing my <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi> the third time,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Third edn., 3 vols. (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), pbd. by Chapman &#x26; Hall, TC&#x2019;s publishers since <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>.</note> which brings me a little money. Of late years I get regularly a kind of <hi rend="italic">rent</hi> from these poor Books of mine; some 2 or 300 a-year of late; which is almost affecting to me, for the &#x201C;estate&#x201C; lay long quite barren, and would pay nothing, not so much as a bit of Canada Forest. Courage always!</p>
<p>There are great fears entertained about the Potatoes this year again; which I <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> will be realized!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The potato famine had ravaged Ireland for the past two years. TC now believed that only through utter catastrophe could the ills of Ireland be removed and a new order instated; see vols. 19&#x2013;21.</note> Fever rages in Ireland, now that famine has somewhat ceased: it is better to go <hi rend="italic">thro</hi>&#x2019; the horrible quagmire than to turn back in it.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Alick: we send you our best blessings, one and all of us, to you and yours.

<p>I am still stationary here; not very definitely looking to any <hi rend="italic">outrake</hi> [excursion] for the Autumn, or to anything else but keeping quiet. We have delightful summer, the best I ever saw here; and with the wind westerly, Chelsea is clear as diamonds; I often think, the Town will be quiet in a week or two now; might I not stay at home, and have more <pb id="pg-22-12" n="22:12"/>repose than I could look for anywhere else? Various people invite me to places a few hours off, where I am to &#x201C;have great freedom&#x201C; &#x26;c: but I have not yet resolved on stirring towards any of them. Jane seems to decide that she, for her part, will sit still. As for me, we shall see.&#x2014; Jack, I imagine, will be with you before long: he is just getting his Printers <hi rend="italic">started</hi>; and could then go on at a distance, almost as well as near.</p>
<p>Does James care about having his Newspaper <hi rend="italic">sooner</hi>? By taking the earliest edition, I think he might get it on <hi rend="italic">Saturday afternoon</hi> at Dumfries. For my own share, I find it an exceeding <hi rend="italic">dud</hi>, and having two others to read on Saturdays, I could as well have it sent off direct as not. If you then sent it on to my Mother, it would still be all the same to me. Jerrold is a poor carping, grinning, insignificant little <hi rend="italic">snaffle</hi>, himself: but his Paper is the <hi rend="italic">biggest</hi> and most copious for <hi rend="italic">news</hi>. Indeed I am not sure but James would like the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >London weekly, of which the Carlyles&#x2019; friend John Forster (see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470723-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, [<date when="1847-07-23">23 July</date>]</ref>) was literary ed.</note> much better: by a little arrangement, they could send it from Scotsbrig, I suppose, or you could thither?&#x2014; On the whole, let us stand by the present plan till we meet, and can <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> the matter over.</p>

<p>Thanks, however, for your excellent description of him.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote, <date when="1847-06-29">29 June</date>, about his visit to Squire the previous week: &#x201C;I found a wholesome, well-grown, florid, clear-eyed, open-browed, man of about my own age! &#x2026; Squire is, I think, a straightforward, choleric, ingenuous fellow&#x2014;a little mad&#x2014;cracks away at his family affairs. &#x2018;One brother is a rascal&#x2014;another a spend-thrift&#x2014;his father was of an amazing size&#x2014;a prodigious eater, etc.&#x2014;the family all gone to <hi rend="italic">smithers</hi>,&#x2019; etc. &#x2026; He seems &#x2026; of the sanguine temperament; and he mentioned a long illness during which he was not allowed to read a book, etc., which looks like some touch of the head. Perhaps brain fever. Perhaps no such thing, but all my fancy. He was very civil; ordered in a bottle of Sherry and biscuits&#x201C; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:563&#x2013;65, who oddly leaves the authenticity of the Squire forgeries undecided).</note> One assists at the sherry and biscuits with you; hears the gentle raps on the table; sees Bullock Squire face to face.

<p>I have received your letter and sonnet,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><lg><l>Shout&#x2014;Earth hath one more teacher&#x2014;loftiest thought</l><lb/>
<l>Once more &#x2019;mongst men high utterance hath found;</l><lb/>

<l>Oh listening nations! Lo, the years have brought</l><lb/>
<l>One who from Wisdom&#x2019;s grasp the torch hath caught</l><lb/>
<l>To light you onwards:&#x2014;shout,&#x2014;Time&#x2019;s dark profound</l><lb/>
<l>Guideless man treads no more: oh, therefore sound To Heaven your praise that gives the aid ye sought.</l><lb/>
<l>Requirest thou for what thou, soul, art here?</l><lb/>
<l>Lo! the reply no longer mystery keeps;&#x2014;</l><lb/>
<l>Life, at the last thy duty lieth clear,</l><lb/>
<l>Mirror&#x2019;d to Heaven in his great thoughts&#x2019; still deeps;</l><lb/>
<l>The thing thy conscience asks, let thy life give,</l><lb/>
<l>So not to time alone, soul, dost thou live.</l></lg><lb/><lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Osborne Place, Blackheath.</hi> (Shepherd 2:10&#x2013;11.)</note> certainly a strong proof of your <pb id="pg-22-16" n="22:16"/>kind feelings to me, which deserves my thanks. For the rest, I fear you have gone much into the common tendency of poets, that of exaggerating, that of dressing up a small reality in the beauties of imagination&#x2014;a tendency which has its worth, and also has its dangers, nay, its worthlessness. In any case, I thank you heartily for your goodwill, which I will keep as one of my possessions, so long as possible; and surely, if I have done you any good at all, it is a real satisfaction to me. May the proof of it appear, with more and more clearness, in the life another brave man leads, while the years are his!&#x2014;that is the best I can wish you.</p>
<p>Your name hitherto is known to me chiefly as associated with verse.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bennett had pbd. <hi rend="italic">My Sonnets</hi> (Greenwich, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>) anonymously and <hi rend="italic">Songs, Ballads &#x2026;</hi> (Greenwich, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>) under his own name.</note> It is one of my constant regrets, in this generation, that men to whom the gods have given a genius (which means a light of intelligence, of courage, and all manfulness, or else means nothing) will insist, in such an earnest time as ours has grown, in bringing out their divine gift in the shape of <hi rend="italic">verse</hi>, which now no man reads entirely in earnest. That a man has to bring out his gift in <hi rend="italic">words</hi> of any kind, and not in silent divine <hi rend="italic">actions</hi>, which alone are fit to express it well, seems to me a great misfortune for him; but that he should select verse with its half credibilities and other sad accompaniments, when he might have prose and be wholly credible, if he desired it,&#x2014;this I lay at the door of our spiritual teachers (<hi rend="italic">pedants</hi> mostly, and speaking an <hi rend="italic">obsolete</hi> dialect), who thereby incalculably rob the world; making him who might have been a soldier and fighter (so terribly <hi rend="italic">wanted</hi> just at present), a mere preacher and idle singer! This is a fixed perception of mine, growing ever more fixed these many years; and I offer it to you, as I have done to many others in the like case, not much hoping that you will believe in it all at once. But, certainly, a good, wise, earnest piece in prose from you would please me better than the musicallest verses could.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Wishing you heartily well, whether in verse or in prose,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bennett did not follow TC&#x2019;s advice but pbd. many more volumes of songs and verse.</note></salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It is a while since you heard directly of me, and I do not even know when Jack wrote; I will write you a line this day, tho&#x2019; I am languid and stupid enough, and there are no news to tell. We have had a beautiful summer all this while, and at present it is still beautiful for all the essential purposes of <pb id="pg-22-19" n="22:19"/>a Summer, for growing of a good harvest namely;&#x2014;but the <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> within this week has grown so powerful that it lames us all! I have no flannel on, and almost no clothes but mere <hi rend="italic">cobwebs</hi>, and pretences of clothes: one would wish to strip almost one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">skin</hi> if one could, for the heat of these baked pavements is very great! Jane takes rather ill with it, and cannot go out except after sunset; as for me I am not so very badly off (tho&#x2019; rendered utterly <hi rend="italic">lazy</hi>), and Jack, I think, does not suffer by it at all. We rejoice, as we are bound, all of us, in the prospect of an abundant crop of every kind of grain; in which advantage all mortals will partake. The potatoes, they say again, are likely to be all rotted.</p>
<p>I have been very <hi rend="italic">busy</hi>, so far as I could, for the last week or more, with an <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> for the new <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi> they are printing. A poor man, called Christie, had done the <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> for me, as well as he could; but it was wrong in every direction, and difficult to correct: I got done with it yesterday.&#x2014; I send you a <hi rend="italic">review</hi>, which came this morning, of your friend D&#x2019;Aubign&#xE9;&#x2019;s new Book on <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>; a poor dud of a Book, I am everywhere told, which he has <hi rend="italic">cabbaged</hi> altogether out of me,&#x2014;the impertinent little snaffle [weakling] that he is!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Henri Merle d&#x2019;Aubign&#xE9; (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>), Swiss Protestant theologian and historian, author of <hi rend="italic">The Protector: A Vindication</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), which was in effect a review of TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> and which aimed to portray Cromwell as a hero of Protestantism. It was reviewed in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1847-07-10">10 July</date>. TC had sent a book, &#x201C;one <hi rend="italic">D&#x2019;Aubigny&#x2019;s</hi> on the Reformation&#x201C; to his family in <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, probably the first vol. of his <hi rend="italic">History of the Great Reformation of the Sixteenth Century</hi> (<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>), and not that by T.

<p>We have had a great many movements, and much jumbling to and fro of people about us, in this &#x201C;heat of the season&#x201C;; but have needed them as little as might be: and now happily the &#x201C;season&#x201C; is about ending, and our poor City is fast emptying itself again. Here is a Letter from New Orleans (the farthest nook of America), which a thickset very honest-looking Yankee Minister brought me some days ago; he a man unknown, <hi rend="italic">introduced</hi> by a man equally unknown!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both unidentified.</note> I used him civilly; and soon got him <hi rend="italic">away</hi>. There come to me many letters and persons of that vague description, whom I, have to <hi rend="italic">get away</hi> in some handsome manner: &#x201C;di&#x2019; tha neither ill na&#x2019; guid.&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280420-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:369</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1828-04-20">20 April 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>What will please you best is that we are still thinking of a journey to the North! Jane I have persuaded to go and see Haddington, if the Donaldsons be quite <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>: she wrote yesterday to ascertain whether it was <hi rend="italic">so</hi>. If they answer Yes, I will take her to Haddington, and run down for a few days to Annandale;&#x2014;any way I still vaguely calculate that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> at least must see you for a few days. Before long, very shortly indeed, I hope to write you more precise predictions on this subject.&#x2014; Somebody ought to send me a word <pb id="pg-22-20" n="22:20"/>of news about you, dear Mother! I got only a little word from Jean since Isabella&#x2019;s Note, and am again worrying. I hope Jenny is now with you, and that you do not suffer much from the heat. Sleep with the <hi rend="italic">door open</hi>; I think that would be useful in such nights as these. And do not go out in the blaze of the Sun; sit in the big room with the window up. <closer><salute>May all blessings be with you, dear good Mother. I write again soon /</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Surely I am bound to write you a little word today; having absolutely no prospect of doing anything as praiseworthy till the Sun go down! I got all my little trumpery <hi rend="italic">work</hi> (as I call it) finished yesterday; and today, except strolling out with the Quality, smoking tobacco, and other such employments, am to be totally idle.</p>
<p>We came out here almost a week ago: it is the Baring&#x2019;s Place (the same people we were with in winter),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1847-01-00">Jan.</date> and <date when="1847-02-00">Feb.</date>; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470119-TC-MAC-01"><sic>21:138&#x2013;62</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1847-01-19">19 Jan. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> quite a little beauty of a place some ten miles off London; to which <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are always running out when the hot pavements begin to afflict them,&#x2014;or when the scene gets wearisome or otherwise offensive. For in fact, they, and others like them, are &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">gay [very] idle of wark</hi>!&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400912-TC-MAC-01"><sic>12:252&#x2013;53</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1840-09-12">12 Sept. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Jane came out with the Lady last Friday (this day week); I followed next day; and here we have been ever since, extremely quiet; and are to return tomorrow to our own poor Chelsea again. Both of us profess to be perceptibly better by this week of country, in the great heat. London is a terrible <hi rend="italic">oven</hi> when the Sun is out and no rain. Here one does not mind the heat; for there is shade of trees, there is free wind, green ground &#x26;c, &#x26;c. People are all in the very heat of their harvest; <hi rend="italic">shearing</hi> wheat, beans and peas; <hi rend="italic">mowing</hi> oats and barley: I think I hardly ever saw better crops, so far as I can judge. The potatoes, however, it is expected, will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> hold out, tho&#x2019; their stems are still green.</p>
<p>Dear good Mother, I wish I could tell you <hi rend="italic">when</hi> or <hi rend="italic">how</hi> I am to come northward, and see you again! But, alas, all that is quite vague yet; Jane needs, really <hi rend="italic">needs</hi>, a little country air this year; and I have not yet been able to fix on any route or scheme of travel that will altogether answer <hi rend="italic">both</hi> sides. Sometimes I think of coming off into the mountains <hi rend="italic">straightway</hi>, and letting all the rest go as it likes: at other times,&#x2014;so wretched a traveller am I, and suffer so much by being bowled about into strange places,&#x2014;I almost decide on sitting still at Chelsea, as the <hi rend="italic">quietest</hi> place, now when the Town is all quiet! But that, I think, will hardly do either. In a little while now, you shall hear what is to be the way of it.</p>
<p>Jack has <hi rend="italic">begun</hi> printing his Book; a leaf of it that I saw, looked considerably better than I expected. He does not yet decide on coming to you, but will come I believe without fail before long. We cannot rightly be there <pb id="pg-22-22" n="22:22"/><hi rend="italic">together</hi>, at least not for any length of time: but I urged him, the last time we talked, to set off without reference to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>; which I would still have him do. His Book once begun, and fairly set under way, there will be nothing to hinder him from coming, and staying.</p>
<p>This morning I got a Note from Mrs Johnstone of Grange,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >B. Newbiggin, widow of William Johnstone, of the Grange, Annandale; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250902-JBW-TC-01"><sic>3:379</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1825-09-02">2 Sept. 1825</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350925-TC-WG-01"><sic>8:214</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1835-09-25">25 Sept. 1835</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We are in a great hurry today; all busy packing, with an eye to leave Town tomorrow morning! We set off, if all go well, at half past ten; Jane and I both. Our face is set <hi rend="italic">northward</hi>; and I, for one, certainly mean to try if I can see Annandale and you before I return. But when, or specially by what route, is yet by no means settled; nor whether Jane will go with me farther than into Derbyshire or Yorkshire, and thence return. She had a speculation, as perhaps I told you, about going on to <hi rend="italic">Haddington</hi> itself; and wrote lately to Miss Donaldson about it: but there were gay Guests coming to the Donaldsons&#x2019;s; and so in spite of their kind invitations, Jane decided to give up that. But I find her in a weakly state of health, and in poor spirits; and withal so much improved by her <hi rend="italic">week</hi> of Addiscombe (from which I dated the last Letter to you), that I really think a little country quiet beside me may do her good. And so we are going to try; and have a ride in the Rail at any rate, and take a look of Derbyshire, and the mineral springs!&#x2014; Our first route, tomorrow, after which nothing is yet fixed, will be to a nice <hi rend="italic">mineral-well</hi> place called Matlock (some 40 or 50 miles) on <hi rend="italic">this</hi> side of Manchester, that is, <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> Manchester for you); there, or else at Buxton, another of the same, <hi rend="italic">nearer</hi> Manchester, we hope to be able to get quiet lodgings, and if so may continue for a while;&#x2014;if not, we travel on, over the hills to Lancashire or Yorkshire: there Jane, if she will not follow me to Scotland, can turn home again, and I will come along by myself. But as I say, nothing is fixed; and you must wait for about 3 days more, and then I shall be able at least to tell you whither to direct a Letter to me; which I cannot at present <pb id="pg-22-25" n="22:25"/>do. I am as usual very &#x201C;stiff to <hi rend="italic">the reyse</hi>&#x201C;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, meaning difficult to stand up after sitting; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400723-TC-AC-01"><sic>12:204</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1840-07-23">23 July 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and dislike travelling terribly:&#x2014; but I suppose it will really do us good to be stirred up a little; and surely, if I could get upon the free moors and hillsides anywhere, and be left altogether in <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> for a while, I feel as as<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> if it would be wholesome for me. In three or perhaps four days more, you may begin to expect farther tidings of us.</p>
<p>We saw Jack yesternight, and the night before: he is very well; busy with his Printers, and getting handsomely on. I too am in my usual way of health, except that 4 days ago, I got a dirty <hi rend="italic">rheumatism in the back</hi>, which has made me ridiculously lame for two days, but is now mostly all go.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> The Matlock waters and the Buxton are of sovereign virtue for that disorder.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Tea is ready,&#x201C; they say: so I must off. <closer><salute>O my dear Mother, I wish I were at your <hi rend="italic">ingle-cheek</hi> [fireside] this night! But that too, we hope, will come. Take care of yourself. Our love to one and all.</salute></closer></p>

<dateline><place>Matlock Bath, Derbyshire</place>, Saturday (<date when="1847-08-07">7 August 1847</date>)</dateline>
<salute>Dear Isabella,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Letter, and Invitation to Jane, which reached us yesterday just as we were on the point of leaving Chelsea for the railway to this place: on our road we saw John at his Lodging for a moment, and he gave us the other Letter you had sent.&#x2014; We are very sorry to hear of Jamie&#x2019;s being so troublesomely unwell, so painfully too. Tell him to be very careful of his diet, which I believe is the best part of the medicine in that affair: I should think too if he bathed in the Burn on a fine morning now and then, and washed very frequently and <hi rend="italic">carefully</hi>, it might do good. The whole misery rises from the Stomach, from the Liver and Skin; the fruitful parents of misery in all manner of ways!&#x2014;&#x2014; I hope my good Mother&#x2019;s toothache is better: we were very sorry to think of her as suffering under that pain while we travelled northward;&#x2014;but perhaps the pain, <hi rend="italic">before that time</hi>, had ceased again, and all was as before: we shall hope so!</p>
<p>Jack was in good heart when we left him; very busy; getting well on with his Book; which will be a great deliverance to him, and a Book of some <pb id="pg-22-26" n="22:26"/>value too. He came to us soon after my Mother&#x2019;s Letter was closed; and we saw him also at his own door, as I said, next morning between 9 and 10.</p>
<p>We had an altogether prosperous journey hither; some 90 miles by the Liverpool rail, then branch off to the right (tho&#x2019; still going north) about sixty miles more; after which an omnibus of 10 miles (going now straight to the <hi rend="italic">left</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">westward</hi> again) brought us to this place: &#x201C;Matlock Bath&#x201C; (about 2 miles from <hi rend="italic">Matlock</hi> by itself, which we have not yet seen), and some 40 or more from Manchester,&#x2014;as, I believe, I explained to my Mother last time.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matlock Bath, 13 mi. W of Derby, on the river Derwent, ca. 2 mi. S of Matlock Town, was famous for its petrifying wells, caves, and scenery.</note> We arrived here about six o&#x2019;clock; had some hawking about in search of &#x201C;Lodgings&#x201C; (not liking to try any of the &#x201C;H&#xF4;tels,&#x201C; tho&#x2019; I believe we might have done there too), but about 8 o&#x2019;clock we had got settled, and sat down fairly at anchor for one week at any rate. The place is wonderfully quiet for such a place; our little Lodging (three very small rooms) is quiet, and has a kind of <hi rend="italic">rustic</hi> character in its bits of elegances, which rather pleases us. The butter this morning (from the people&#x2019;s own cow) reminded us of that of Scotsbrig.</p>
<p>This place &#x201C;Matlock Bath&#x201C; owes its principal existence to three <hi rend="italic">luke</hi>-warm Springs, in which people pretend to bathe for cure of rheumatisms &#x26;c, and also to its being a place celebrated for its &#x201C;fine views,&#x201C; and indeed a really singular place, worth looking upon as one passes. The river Derwent, coming from North southwards, finds its way (in a very sluggish style for most part) thro&#x2019; a huge winding chasm or cleft in a mass of limestone hills, which look as if shivered by earthquakes, or <hi rend="italic">broken</hi> (from within) <hi rend="italic">over one&#x2019;s knee</hi>; they rise in great cliffs just hereabouts near two hundred feet high, and leave almost no room, except just for the little river (about the size of Milkwater I should guess), and for a thick sheet of trees and bushes along their flanks, wherever there is room for a bush or tree. The entire valley or &#x201C;Dale of Matlock&#x201C; lasts for some two miles or more; but this which I called the Cleft or Chasm (where the sides are so <hi rend="italic">precipitous</hi>) does not last quite half-a-mile, I think; and it is in this about the <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> part of the &#x201C;Dale&#x201C; that Matlock Bath is situated. One of the strangest places in the world! May be about midway between Ecclefechan and Middlebie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A few mi. NE of Ecclefechan.</note> in point of size; but it nowhere sticks together; the houses are all perched, one here one there, along the western precipice (the eastern I think has none, nor is there any bridge thither, only boats) where there is space at all; you approach them by zigzag paths, often artificially cut: every house is far deeper in the front than in the rear, seen from the bottom they look like little <hi rend="italic">bird-cages</hi> nailed against a wall, looking out from the bushes here and <pb id="pg-22-27" n="22:27"/>there. There is <supplied>[a]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> road cut out by the side of the river, low down, and a kind of street for some little while there, but the rest is all as I describe;&#x2014;mostly rather poor houses, inhabited by quarriers, miners &#x26;c (which was of old the one employment of the people); almost all the <hi rend="italic">tolerable</hi> houses are for &#x201C;Lodgers,&#x201C; and there is a sufficient fry of &#x201C;guides&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c. Enough of them and their place: in a week&#x2019;s time, if we do not grow to <hi rend="italic">like</hi> it, we can lift anchor again, and set off elsewhither; and that is all we have to do with it at present.</p>
<p>Whether Jane will be persuaded to come to the[?] north according to your kind counsel I can not yet say: but if she prosper here, I am not without hope of persuading her. We shall see. Indeed all is very uncertain with us yet.</p>
<p>I send you the Address &#x201C;Mr Pearson, Temple Terrace, Matlock Bath, Derbyshire&#x201C;: I also put it on a cover, that some of you may send me a line to say how my Mother and Jamie are. And so good-b&#x2019;ye Dear Isabella. Jane joins in thanks and regards of the kindest, to you and to them all.</p>

<p>This is the strangest place I have ever seen; and, if the wretched canting Guidebooks and View-hunters would let one alone, one of the beautifullest. It seems quiet too, which is a far greater charm; offers a fine scope of woods, hillsides, and solitary high-lying paths; if we could succeed in getting fairly anchored, it might suit poor wearied creatures like us very well. As was said, we are to try it for a week. &#x2026;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We got along very happily on Friday, all the way, having nothing to complain of from men or machines or heavenly elements; about half past 3 or 4 we were safe in Derby, worrying down a most hasty slice of roast-mutton and tough bread; after which a rapid whirl of some half hour, or not <pb id="pg-22-28" n="22:28"/>much more, put us down at Ambergate<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A railway junction ca. 7 mi. S of Matlock Bath.</note> (where we saw your friends the Limekilns with windowed chimnies to them); and there a heavy-laden omnibus took us upon its back or into its belly, and in about an hour-and-half more, put us down at one of the H&#xF4;tels in this thrice and four-times world-celebrated Village of Matlock <hi rend="italic">Bath</hi>. I say Matlock Bath; for <hi rend="italic">Matlock</hi> proper is quite another place, some two miles farther up the river, and distinguished by nothing but a little <hi rend="italic">cotton</hi>,&#x2014;where we have not yet been. It was only by the accidental conversation of an ancient man sitting beside me on the Omnibus that I knew we had to stop here, and did not push on for the other fallacious goal.</p>
<p>We left our trunks &#x26;c under care of the H&#xF4;tel Boots, and proceeded straight in search of &#x201C;private Lodgings.&#x201C; Lodgings are moderately plentiful; nay I know not but the H&#xF4;tel, tho&#x2019; a very little dearer, and what was more to us a somewhat noisier, might have suited as well for our purposes as the &#x201C;private&#x201C; arrangement. The three H&#xF4;tels are all fine airy houses, seemingly the best in the place; and Matlock is not Malvern for noise, but a comparatively very quiet place, tenanted by invalids, manufacturing ennuy&#xE9;s, and people generally who make no great din. However we did get private lodgings; moderately successfully, and without any difficulty: the place we first entered was <hi rend="italic">this</hi> place, where we have ultimately fixed. Our accommodation is two upper rooms, or rather cells, to sleep in, and a first-floor room or cell to sit in; most infirm rustic apartments but done up with a certain &#x201C;elegance of poverty&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Cowper, &#x201C;Table Talk&#x201C; 588.</note> that rather attracted us: rent including extras, 30/ per week! The poor people have a skill in charging rent, while their brief hour is! For 2 guineas we could have had prettier and larger rooms, but with less appearance of quiet, and with landlordage of less promising physiognomy; and nowhere with so fine a view from the windows,&#x2014;in that latter respect we stand unrivalled. As to household necessaries, Jane says they are a shade <hi rend="italic">dearer</hi> than in London, and all procurable of moderate quality. For a week we shall do tolerably well here; a kind of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>-week, in which we are to forget all the world, and be forgotten by it,&#x2014;not so much as a Letter possible here till Tuesday morning; and every day a day in which one can walk or sleep, and smoke or read or dream and dawdle at one&#x2019;s own sweet will.&#x2014; I have had, this morning, a considerable walk before breakfast, down to Cromford, past Arkwright&#x2019;s place and his two Mills; one of them, the Cromford one if I mistake not, the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> erected Mill in England, and consequently the Mother of all Mills.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Richard Arkwright (<date when="1732-00-00">1732</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792-00-00">92</date>), inventor and industrialist, established his first cotton-spinning mill, powered by horses, at Hockley, Notts., <date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>, built the first cotton-spinning mill powered by water at Cromford, 1&#xBD; mi. from Matlock Bath, <date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>, where he developed, <date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>, a machine to perform the whole process of yarn manufacture. TC&#x2019;s interest in him is shown in <hi rend="italic">Chartism, Works</hi> 29:182.</note> Near by it is <pb id="pg-22-29" n="22:29"/>Willersley &#x201C;Castle&#x201C; so-called; a solid sumptuous-looking free stone Castle built by Arkwright, and now tenanted by his grandson.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Built ca. <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date> by the architect William Thomas (fl. <date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1794-00-00">94</date>). Peter Arkwright (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), grandson.</note> The Mother of all Mills, I was sorry to hear, had lost most of its water, by new mine-drainings in late years; and was very nearly fallen silent now, likely soon to go out altogether.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Though thirty years later the mills were only partly in use, the original mill and two others were said still to employ &#x201C;a large number of hands&#x201C; and to use waterpower from a channel for draining the mines (<hi rend="italic">Handbook for Travellers in Derbyshire</hi> [1874] 25).</note> I clomb also to the tops of fine breezy hills, by narrow stony paths; but had to make haste home again, and found Jane walking on &#x201C;Temple Terrace&#x201C; here, waiting my return for breakfast.</p>
<p>I will not trouble you with much description; but take this in the way of <hi rend="italic">scientific</hi> increment of knowledge, if you like. The thing called &#x201C;Matlock Dale,&#x201C; about the <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> part of which we stand here, begins as I understand somewhere below Matlock Village northwards, and ends at the south about Cromford (aforesaid), some two miles in all; and is a great yawning chasm, rent across a range of limestone Hills, watered by the flow of the river Derwent, a green rather foul-coloured stream, which may rank about the size of Milk Water.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A stream that flows into the Annan 4 mi. SW of Ecclefechan.</note> Both sides of this said Dale are very precipitous, and as is usual in fine limestone country, very <hi rend="italic">vegetative</hi>, fond of producing trees, bushes, ivy, grass, wherever there is the smallest opportunity for a root. Both sides are precipitous, but the <hi rend="italic">west</hi>, especially hereabouts, is most so, indeed almost quite <hi rend="italic">sheer</hi>, just opposite our windows, a sheer whitish wall of rock, winding about, perhaps near 200 feet high, and all along well mantled with wood &#x26;c: our Village again stands altogether on the <hi rend="italic">eastern</hi> side of the River; stands, or rather <hi rend="italic">hangs</hi>; for you never, in this country, saw human houses so situated; all stuck along the steep, connected by zigzag paths, shrouded in wood, overlooked, they too, by bare cliffs;&#x2014;at night with their lit windows you might think them caves of the Troglodytes, by day they are as Bird-cages, each hung by its nail on the green wall. The only <hi rend="italic">platforms</hi> of any extent (and they not of much) are occupied by the H&#xF4;tels, three in number;&#x2014;and a small patch of <hi rend="italic">Street</hi>, for one little while, attaches itself to the carriage road, which runs close by the river, <hi rend="italic">hewn</hi> out in many parts,&#x2014;very far <hi rend="italic">below</hi> where I now write. Such is Matlock Bath; a place for lounging; and for bathing in three <hi rend="italic">luke</hi>warm Springs (properly <hi rend="italic">Tanks</hi>, where you use them), not warmer I think than about 60&#xB0; of Farenheit;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact, 68&#xB0; F.</note> pale-greenish in colour, mawkish-insipid in taste, <pb id="pg-22-30" n="22:30"/>pleasant enough to swim in,&#x2014;and according to my guess, probably not worth twopence for any complaint in the Nosology, except as the imagination may be solaced by them a little. <hi rend="italic">Ohe, jam satis est [</hi>Now, that is enough<hi rend="italic">]</hi>!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Martial, <hi rend="italic">Epigrammata</hi> 4.59.9 (cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260304-JBW-TC-01"><sic>4:49</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1826-03-04">4 March 1826</date></corr></ref>), and cf.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Your face, whatever morning it appears here, shall be as that of a friend to us. We will cheerfully traverse the Peak Country under your able guidance;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster&#x2019;s home was at Rawdon, Yorks, nr. Leeds. The Peak District is properly in N and NW Derbyshire, but its characteristic scenery extends into portions of Staffordshire and Cheshire.</note> cheerfully go home with you, and lie dormant for a day or two, guarded by that invaluable housedog. At least such is our feeling, the feeling of both of us, this day, on reading your hospitable Letter. Come therefore when it suits you,&#x2014;not later than Friday, for our inaction has to cease then. Drive to the &#x201C;Old Bath H&#xF4;tel&#x201C; close by this; there are no more beds attainable here; and even if there were, I judge by farther experience the Old Bath might be preferable.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-22-31" n="22:31"/>There are, according to the Guide-Books, numerous &#x201C;interesting drives&#x201C; on all sides of Matlock: but, to us, to sit down anywhere, and look peaceably around, is altogether as good; the very &#x201C;Heights of Abraham,&#x201C; within gunshot of us, but beset by intricate conditions, zigzag paths, and loquacious hungry Guides, remain unscaled hitherto. We had a kind of purpose to glance into Dovedale (Ashbourne seems to be some 12 miles off); to pass one day in the Buxton Crescent; to visit very transiently the Peak Cavern;&#x2014;and, for my own behoof, I had determined to try at Tideswell (a village in the Buxton region) whether the Church-Register would not at least authentically tell me on what day <hi rend="italic">James Brindley</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ashbourne is on a branch of the river Dove, S verge of the Peak District, ca. 16 mi. from Matlock. The Palladian Crescent in Buxton was built, <date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1784-00-00">84</date>, in emulation of the crescents at Bath. Peak Cavern, nr.

According to Samuel Smiles&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Engineers</hi>, Brindley was born nr. Tunstead, in the parish of Wormhills, ca. 3 mi.

Come, then; before Friday; and be prepared in some measure to take the reins.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster replied, <date when="1847-08-11">11 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I have sundry offerings to pay at the shrine of Mammon tomorrow, bills to provide &#x26;c., but if his Mammonship be any way propitious, I mean to leave by the Mail-train, which will get me to the Old Bath Hotel, some time in the night, &#x26; to you early on Friday morning, when I shall be delighted to act pilot, especially as the whole district is to me an unknown sea.&#x201C;.</note>&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever truly,</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p>Just a line to put you out of uncertainty&#x2014;which I know by almost continual forced experience to be the most wasteful state a human being can be kept in&#x2014;</p>
<p>On Friday we go to Buxton for one day&#x2014;and then away with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster heaven knows how or where towards his house at Bradford&#x2014; There C tells <pb id="pg-22-32" n="22:32"/>me I should be just about as much out of the road of Liverpool as at Chelsea&#x2014;and so&#x2014;you will not have to put off your going for me&#x2014;</p>
<p>They write the kindest invitations from Scotsbrig and C presses me to go along with him&#x2014; But Dear Helen what <hi rend="italic">could</hi> I do at Scotsbrig looking out on the hills between there and Thornhill unless just cry myself sick&#x2014; Oh no I cannot go&#x2014; To get back to Chelsea and clean my house and be quite alone is best for me. We get on very peaceably here&#x2014;walking eating and sleeping. a great deal of walking which helps one to the other two things&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have seen few of the regular sights of the place yet but mean to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> a few of them before Friday. we have in the same house a young man dying of consumption and this morning there was a wedding&#x2014; So goes it in the world&#x2014; Love to Mary<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh, Helen&#x2019;s youngest sister.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We got Isabella&#x2019;s Letter very speedily; thank her for it. We are sorry you are still somewhat out of order: pray take care of yourself, and get well again directly!&#x2014; &#x2014; We have got along here very fairly all the week: wet days now and then; but not very wet, and we did not mind them. I had some of my best &#x201C;long walks&#x201C; under a solitary umbrella. Jane certainly is no worse for her jaunt hitherto, nor am I. We had a Note from Jean at Dumfries; very urgent too on Jane to come to Scotland again; however I rather apprehend she will not still be prevailed upon to make it out.</p>
<p>We are now just about leaving this station. The Mr Forster, an excellent cheery young Manufacturer in the Leeds region, who wrote that Note here enclosed,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1847-08-11">11 Aug.</date></note> is expected <hi rend="italic">today</hi> (indeed perhaps <hi rend="italic">this hour</hi>), and with him we are to rove for some day or two over the Peak region (we are to be at Buxton, another much bigger watering-place and &#x201C;bath,&#x201C; some 20 miles off this, till Monday); and before the middle of next week, probably enough on Wednesday, we expect to be at Forster&#x2019;s house, and there anchored for a week once more. He is a bachelor; of cheery temper, of <hi rend="italic">Quaker</hi> genealogy and breeding, but himself not much of a Quaker; he describes his house, as large, and abundantly quiet: so with him, and his &#x201C;housedog,&#x201C; I daresay we shall do very well. &#x201C;W. E. Forster Esq / Rawden, near / Leeds.&#x201C; I will write to you again when we get there, or soon after.</p>
<p>This morning we had a Note from Jack,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably that dated <date when="1847-08-09">9 Aug.</date></note> which I enclose: all is well there.&#x2014; I know not whether I or anybody mentioned to you (I fear it was forgot) that, just before leaving Chelsea, I had a Newspaper from Alick <pb id="pg-22-34" n="22:34"/>with the due two strokes on it, indicating that about the &#x201C;<date when="1847-07-07">7<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of july</date>&#x201C; all was well with him. I suppose, too busy with his harvest to write. This will perhaps still some anxieties your heart may have been creating for itself.&#x2014; &#x2014; But I must clearly <hi rend="italic">end</hi>. <closer><salute>Good b&#x2019;ye, dear good Mother: Jane salutes you all. You shall soon hear again. Blessings with you, one and all. Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>From this halting-point in our pilgrimage, I fire off a short Note towards you; who, I doubt not, are very willing to hear how we progress. These two or three days I have wished to write; but never till now could fairly get out my blottingbook, or find a quiet corner.</p>
<p>Jane, I think, wrote to you from Matlock, how we were minded to have a look at the Peak Country of Derbyshire, and expected the Mr Forster of this place to join us in the expeditions Forster appeared duly on the Friday morning last; a most cheerful, honest, affectionate, long-legged young man, of really sociable, intelligent and every way polite, and agreeable habits;&#x2014;whom I, glad to escape the lark myself, instantly constituted Captain of the expedition: so <hi rend="italic">he</hi> settled all bills and waiters and <hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi>, engaged all carriages, and managed, so far as might be, the whole business; leaving me to my own reflexions, and my own tobacco; which was a mighty benefit indeed. The weather too had suddenly dried up; and it kept dry and excellent just till we had done, and then began to rain again, which it has last night been vigorously doing: so that in all respects we were favourably circumstanced for our little expedition.</p>
<p>On the Friday we went to a place called Dovedale, a little rocky valley on the River Dove,&#x2014;infinitely celebrated by Tourists;&#x2014;which we looked at, without much criticism, and not without a certain degree of pleasure, especially as the drive thither and back was all along thro&#x2019; beautiful green hollows and airy limestone heights, with their queer clean old grey villages (all trimmed and cleaned to perfection), their solitary mine-heaps (of lead-rubbish), saw-mills (of Derbyshire stone), huge quarry-chasms &#x26;c &#x26;c. We got back again safe by nine o&#x2019;clock to tea at Matlock (it is some 12 or 14 miles off); and next morning we quitted Matlock for good,&#x2014;towards Buxton, which is another much more frequented watering-place, about 22 <pb id="pg-22-35" n="22:35"/>miles nearer you. Of Buxton I will tell you various things when we meet: it is a place all elegantly &#x201C;for the occasion got up&#x201C;; seemed likely to be wholesome, lying high up among bare green hills;&#x2014;and must, I thought, be the chosen home of Donothing <hi rend="italic">Wearisomeness</hi> for all the Northern Counties. We dined at their &#x201C;public table,&#x201C; &#x201C;saw the Manners&#x201C; (as Tommy Johnstone says); and came away heartily glad that we <hi rend="italic">had</hi> seen it all, and needed not, without other errand, go again to see it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster wrote to Sarah Fox (see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430623-TC-WEF-01"><sic>16:217</sic><corr>TC to WEF, <date when="1843-06-23">23 June 1843</date></corr></ref>), <date when="1847-08-17">17 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Determined to see Buxton properly, we drove to a first-class hotel in the Crescent&#x2014;a stylish, comfortless temple of <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi>, inhabited by old maids, and worn-out half-pay <hi rend="italic">rou&#xE9;s</hi>, and peaked-up parsons, a species of walking white neck-cloths, altogether a race of men the most opposite to Carlylean that can be conceived. Well, down we went to the <hi rend="italic">table-d&#x2019;h&#xF4;te</hi>, self at the bottom as last comer, C. and his wife on one side of me, and a tall, starched, gentlemanly Irish parson, the ruling genius loci on my left. For a time all went on easily in silent feeding or low grumbling, till at last Carlyle began to converse with parson, then to argue with him on Ireland, then to lose thought of all arguments or <hi rend="italic">table-d&#x2019;h&#xF4;te</hi>, and to declaim. How they did stare. All other speech was hushed; some looked aghast, others admiring. Of course they none of them had ever heard or seen any approach to such monster. We remained <hi rend="italic">incog</hi>. the whole time, spite of all the schemes of the guests, and the entreaties of the waiter to book our names, and my proposal to Mrs. C. to save our expenses by showing him at so much a head&#x201C; (T. Wemyss Reid, <hi rend="italic">Life of the Right Honourable William Edward Forster</hi>, 2 vols. [1888] 1:208&#x2013;9). Tommy Johnstone is unidentified.</note> A most elegant; and I should imagine most inexpressibly wearisome place!&#x2014; Our next stage was to Tideswell (8 miles N.W. from Buxton), where I hoped to have found in the <hi rend="italic">Birth-Register</hi> of the Parish the entry of &#x201C;James Brindley, <date when="1716-00-00">1716</date>&#x201C; (the enormous Engineer Brindley, who made all the Canal-business in last century); but, after search, it was not there. I am to write, and try elsewhere.&#x2014; From Tideswell, north 7 miles, in Castleton, a beautiful secluded old Village (1,000 years old or more) in the deep lap of the mountains; and close by is the most enormous Cavern in the world, called now, in polite language, <hi rend="italic">Peak Cavern</hi>, but formerly in vulgar but expressive English <hi rend="italic">The Devil&#x2019;s</hi>&#x2014;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">i&#x2019; Peak</hi>! To which latter name, if one could conceive such an object as the said &#x201C;&#x2014;&#x2014;,&#x201C; it has really fair claims.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Thomas Hobbes&#x2019;s Latin poem <hi rend="italic">De Mirabilis Pecci: Being the Wonders of the Peak in Darby-shire, Commonly called The Devil&#x2019;s Arse of Peak</hi>, pbd. with a trans. by a &#x201C;Person of Quality&#x201C; (1678), &#x201C;As most does stile it to the <hi rend="italic">Devil&#x2019;s Arse</hi> / <hi rend="italic">Peaks Arse</hi> the Natives&#x201C; (30).</note> A huge Cave, runs 860 yards sloping down into the bowels of the mountain, has running waters, pools that you go over in boat; now narrow vaulted like a tunnel, then expanding into great expanses like cathedrals (some seven hundred and odd yards below the ground): really a curious place, this Devil&#x2019;s&#x2014;i&#x2019; Peak, and seen without difficulty for a little money. Some rope-spinners have set up their wheels under the high vaulted entrance, and spin there rent-free,&#x2014;one of whom, an eminent Methodist, we heard <pb id="pg-22-36" n="22:36"/>preach in the Chapel afterwards; or rather praying, it was, and very characteristic of its kind.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Writing to the same friend, <date when="1847-08-16">16 Aug.</date>, Forster said: &#x201C;I find my company not only informing but most pleasant and easy. Mrs. C. like a girl in her delight at new scenes and situations, and the master uncommonly good-humoured and accommodating, glad to find any one to relieve him of the trouble of travelling, his general tone a good-natured humorous sarcasm, but every now and then a burst of furious indignation or a flash of fiery eloquence. / His pictorial power is wonderful, I should think unmatched. It is pleasant to see such a mind so completely at play, and moreover they have both of them so much real heart and genial kindness about them that I believe I shall form a decided friendship with them. It&#x2019;s little notion of a Sunday they have; but last evening I deluded them into a Methody meeting-house, for which I did catch it afterwards. It was a sad failure, a local preacher full of fluent cant, or rather a pair of them praying at one another with all sorts of disgusting contortions. I was sorry to be with him at such a burlesque of prayer. He was furious afterwards, declaring that their belief, if any, was in &#x2018;a heaven of lubber-land,&#x2019; &#x2018;a paradise of Burton ale and greasy cakes,&#x2019; and declared that little more would have roused him to protest, that it would be well &#x2018;if they would forthwith cast off this rotten blanket, and step forth in their naked skin,&#x2014;said rotten blanket being the Methody garment of the religious idea&#x2019;&#x201C; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> 1:207&#x2013;8).</note></p>
<p>But in fine dear Jean, to make my long tale short, know that we quitted Castleton and Derbyshire yesterday morning; came <hi rend="italic">spieling</hi> [climbing], in our own hired &#x201C;clatch&#x201C; (a kind of Double Gig, such as the place yielded) over the hills to Sheffield and Yorkshire; drove rapidly thro&#x2019; Sheffield and its sooty flaming mills, and screeching cutleries, to the railway station; and, just catching our train, were duly whirled away to Leeds (some 40 miles), and then with 7 miles more in a &#x201C;neat fly&#x201C; were safely lodged here, about dusk, on our hospitable Hilltop far enough from all the smoke, in one of the most hospitable, pleasant and quiet mansions, I think, within the Four Seas. I have not slept in so utterly still a place these many years. Forster is off after breakfast to his business (Mill, Warehouse &#x26;c) at Bradford some five miles distant; and here Jane and I are left sovereigns of the Mansion, with nothing in it but a quiet old Quaker dame of a housekeeper, and some maids &#x26;c who seem all to be shod in felt, so still and noiseless are they, and look as clean as if they had just come out of Spring wells: Really an excellent old House: it has belonged to some <hi rend="italic">Laird</hi> in old days when Lairds still were; and Forster has thoroughly repaired and modernised it; and retires to this distance every afternoon, to be away from Bradford and its noise and reek, and sit silent or converse with quiet friends here. That is the end of our pilgrimage for the present; which surely has done very well hitherto. Jane was in unusual heart all the way; did indeed break down at Castleton, the night before last, and had to be brought hither to take her <hi rend="italic">breakfast</hi> (towards sunset) yesterday, and to commence sleeping directly after: but she is now all alive again, and I suppose will do well, if well let alone now.&#x2014;&#x2014; For the rest, I have entirely and unaccountably lost James&#x2019;s Newspaper this week: it and my Mother&#x2019;s both! I received them both at <pb id="pg-22-37" n="22:37"/>Buxton; carried them all day in my pocket yesterday; <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> them near Leeds, but could never see them again; they had hustled out of my Coat, which was lying loose. I send you an Irish <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Dublin weekly, sent gratis to TC by the ed., Charles Gavan Duffy (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1903-00-00">1903</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32921"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Irish nationalist and TC&#x2019;s friend since <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450428-TC-MAC-01"><sic>19:64&#x2013;66</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1845-04-28">28 April 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> instead; which probably will do almost as well. My Mother&#x2019;s is a greater loss, for there was a smart review of D&#x2019;Aubign&#xE9;&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> in it (filliping <hi rend="italic">his</hi> foolish nose very handsomely out of that job), which I could have wished her to see.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1847-08-14">14 Aug.</date>, unfavorably reviewed d&#x2019;Aubign&#xE9;&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Protector</hi>, finding in it &#x201C;silly, unmeaning, childish absurdity which pervades what is meant for the argument and the eloquence.&#x201C;.</note></p>
<p>Today I will write my Mother a small Note, to keep her in peace about us; and pray do you immediately send off <hi rend="italic">this</hi> to her, that she and Scotsbrig may know all the outs and ins: I will tell her to expect it straightway. And then with a little Note to Jack, merely to give our Address, I will conclude writing this day, and go out to have a ride, for there is a horse, and the rain seems nearly done.</p>
<p>You may safely write to us here; for I think we shall certainly stay a few days. Our future movements, except that I am coming Northwards by and by, are all undetermined farther than this point. Here we are to rest and be thankful for a time. I will tell Isabella to write too, for my Mother was not very well.</p>
<p>And so enough, dear Jean, for one day. You shall hear again in due Season. Jane salutes you all. I add no more but my blessing; and am ever</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>No doubt you are looking out for some tidings from us; I accordingly without delay send you a word of assurance that we have successfully concluded our bits of &#x2018;Travels for the present, and are quietly set down here in Friend Forster&#x2019;s house; one of the pleasantest establishments we <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have been left in, so far as yet appears.</p>
<p>We have seen all the watering places and chief &#x201C;wonderful wonders of <pb id="pg-22-38" n="22:38"/>wonders&#x201C; that there are in Derbyshire,&#x2014;have penetrated even into &#x201C;the Devil&#x2019;s &#x2014;&#x2014; i&#x2019; Peak,&#x201C; a horrid Cavern in the Peak Country so called:&#x2014; concerning several of which illustrious wonders I have just written a longish Letter to Jean; which I have charged her to send you; so that you will likely receive it the day after this comes; and I need not say anything more on that subject here. Among the sights <hi rend="italic">omitted</hi> in Jean&#x2019;s Letter was that of a lone old woman, living literally like a rabbit, burrowed underground: this was near Buxton; a sight worth remembering! There are huge quarries of lime there; the rubbish, ashes of the kilns &#x26;c, when many years exposed to the weather, hardens into real stone; and is then a kind of rocky mole-heap, of large dimensions, with grass &#x26;c on the top: the natives then scrape out the inside, and make a cottage of the upper crust! There are five or six such huts in that place, and used to be more. This poor old woman and her hut were all as tidy as a new pin, whitewashed, scoured &#x26;c; a most sensible haughty and even dignified old woman; had been born there, had lost father, mother, husband, son there; and was drinking her poor tea there in dignified solitude when we came; no company with her but a cat; and no wish to have any, she said, &#x201C;till the Lord were pleased to take her to those she had lost.&#x201C; An elder Sister, upwards of four-score, inhabiting, with some children and grandchildren, a similar cave not far off, had just fallen into the fire, and been burnt to death, two days before. None of us, I think, will ever forget that poor old woman; with her little teapot, her neat <foreign><hi rend="italic">mutch</hi></foreign> [cap] and black-ribbon, her lean hook nose, and black old eyes, as sharp as eagles&#x2019;s! We left a shilling with her, and great respect, and came our way.&#x2014; But see! I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> actually talked half of my sheet almost, on the subject of my travels; of which, by the bargain, I had nothing to say here!</p>
<p>The sum is, dear Mother, we are well and safe; and coming, at least one of us, towards you; right thankful to see your face once again. Let that for the present be enough. And let Isabella again write a word, simply to tell us how you are,&#x2014;if we might hope that you are got pretty well about again now? At all events let her tell us what the <hi rend="italic">fact is</hi>; for I daresay our anxieties are apt to aggravate rather than diminish.&#x2014; I have lost your <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> out of my pocket after carrying it many miles; I send you another Newspaper, the bad-best attainable here, instead.

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Are you at present in these parts? My Wife and I have been in Derbyshire, drinking the Matlock waters, looking into the bottomless ennui of Buxton, into Haddon Hall,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of seats of the Duke of Rutland and the most thoroughly preserved of medieval houses in England, ca. 5 mi. N of Matlock Bath.</note> and the wonders of the Devil&#x2019;s apparatus in the Peak; and we have now arrived at fixed quarters, for a few days, and are capable of looking deliberately before and after.</p>
<p>If you are at Fryston,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Milnes home in Yorkshire, nr. Ferrybridge, which TC had visited in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410407-TC-JWC-01"><sic>13:80&#x2013;99</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1841-04-07">7 April 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> I will give you a meeting any day, at any spot near mid distance; and hold with you a solemn conference of more than an hour&#x2019;s continuance. This place is seven miles <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> Leeds: I saw Temple Newsam,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A great house built after <date when="1622-00-00">1622</date> and altered in the eighteenth cent., ca. 4 mi.

My humane Landlord, really a good Samaritan, and an excellent cheerful intelligent young man whom you would like,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wemyss Reid believed that Forster and Milnes had already met in Bradford (<hi rend="italic">Life of Forster</hi> 1:205), but Milnes wrote TC, [<date when="1847-08-23">23 Aug.</date>], that he hoped &#x201C;to know Mr Forster some day soon.&#x201C;.</note>&#x2014;allows me a horse, horses; and I should like, as always, right well to see you. Our length of stay here is undetermined; cannot readily be long. Pray consider what can be done, and let us do it.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Milnes,&#x2014;</salute>What shall I answer to your hospitable message?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Friday, [<date when="1847-08-20">20 Aug.</date>], from Fryston, insisting that &#x201C;you &#x26; Madame <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come here from Monday to Wednesday,&#x201C; and again, [<date when="1847-08-23">23 Aug.</date>], saying &#x201C;we are all quite vexed with you&#x201C; and suggesting various ways of getting to Fryston.</note> Alas, a man does not travel on wings, does not even carry <hi rend="italic">his own feathers</hi> with him on foot; otherwise in me there were no delay!</p>
<p>But I am rheumatic, dyspeptic, insomnolent, as you have known me; and above all things, <hi rend="italic">lazy</hi> as a Lotus-eater, looking out on these green heights, and their distant industries and steeple-chimnies, as if they and I were all a Dream;&#x2014;and in fact, feel unequal to any kind of travelling enterprise, if it be not a morning ride, and back again to my own silent roost at night, with no task before me for the morrow! It is even so. My Wife cannot be persuaded from this spot at present:&#x2014;would to Heaven any Commercial Gentleman would but put me into his blue bag, and fling me out at Ferrybridge, without effort of mine! But there is no hope of the like of that; and without such hope, the question again is, what shall I do?</p>
<p>Cannot you, as originally projected, meet me somewhere about mid way on Tuesday; and there hold conference <hi rend="italic"><foreign>ad libitum</foreign></hi>? This, they tell me, is &#x201C;absurd.&#x201C; Then, cannot you yourself come hither, you who are a born traveller, and love locomotion for its own sake? Forster, who knows you well by writing and otherwise, bids me say that of course he will be charmed to have you for guest: he can lodge you very well;&#x2014;and really is not unworthy to be known to you, now or at some other time. What say you? Is there any feasibility in that? Alas, I fear, not much!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Failing all things, there is Tuesday with its new capabilities, facilities, so hopeful in the distance of eight-and forty-hours.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Sun.</note> I feel as if I could ride to Fryston and back again, myself, on Tuesday&#x2014;eight-and-forty hours off!

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Jane wishes you to go down to Cheyne Row, and give Anne in her name half a sovereign: this, she thinks, will do better than a whole sovereign, as indicating that the period of <hi rend="italic">return</hi> is probably not distant. Pray do this tomorrow, or so soon as you have leisure.</p>
<p>We go along here in our original way; and feel in general very quiet and rural: we have yet settled nothing about a day of departure; or indeed about anything,&#x2014;except that, I think Jane will directly turn southward <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I go northward; which period, to judge by our total and absolute idleness here, cannot be put off for very long now. We have the beautifullest bright autumn weather; see nothing, over hill and dale, but green and gold; all steeple-chimnies and disturbances safe in the distance: add to which we have the hospitablest cheeriest landlord, and an excellent horse to ride:&#x2014;sure enough, one might go farther for a bit of rustication, and fare worse!</p>
<p>One day, Monday I think it was, we went all to Bradford; Forster with Jane in his Gig, with a new horse he was buying; I some two hours afterwards, solitary, on the back of F.&#x2019;s mare. Bradford, some 5 miles off, is a huge huggermugger smoky Town, of I suppose 80 or 100 thousand spinners and weavers; deforming with black clouds and every kind of dust and rubbish a beautiful hill side, and converting its once limpid brook into a black hellgruel:&#x2014;not without interesting objects and phases either. But our memorablest adventure was the journey homewards. Forster and Jane had set off first; and it appears their new horse manifested, all along, a decided tendency to run off; the roads exceedingly steep, but F. holding in, and guiding, with exemplary skill. I did not come up with them, till we had crossed the Aire,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >River 70 mi. long flowing SE and E through Leeds to the river Ouse.</note> and were climbing the last hill, a long steep ascent of near a mile which ends at Forster&#x2019;s house here. They waved me not to <pb id="pg-22-42" n="22:42"/>press near at a swift pace; I drew bridle accordingly, and they, finding the ascent now softer, set off again to trot: but lo, the wicked animal took instantly to kicking, to violent plunging, and they rounded a corner with the certainty left in my mind that I should find them all in ruin in a second or two when I got round! Some men had already come up, and were striving to assist: but my first glance, on getting round, did shew me poor Forster getting pitched out, the gig-shafts broken, men at the head of the horse, and Jane starting up from amid the rubbish with dust on her shoulder! Forster&#x2019;s ancle is still under the sprain, tho&#x2019; now fast mending; Jane&#x2019;s shoulder grew rather sore after 24 hours, but is now quite well again; the new horse was instantly dismissed with protest, and the gig sent to be mended: this happily was <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the damage, and driving has been mostly in abeyance ever since.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster wrote to his mother that JWC &#x201C;behaved with wonderful presence of mind; turned her back to the horse, and embraced the gig, and so just rolled out, and was not hurt&#x201C; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">Life of Forster</hi> 1:214).</note></p>
<p>We had a man called Phillips (&#x201C;the Monkey of Carlyle,&#x201C; as Mazzini&#x2019;s translation of &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">singe de Rousseau</hi></foreign>&#x201C; would give it):<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently the &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">singe de Rousseau</hi></foreign>&#x201C; was an imitator, an ape, not a monkey in literal sense as Mazzini translated it. Phillips is unidentified.</note> a vague, innocent, vivacious but wearisome man; he went on the morrow morning. Others, either two or three, also wearisome, have been here to tea; but Forster does not trouble me on that side, where it can be helped. We drove one day to Bolton Abbey,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An Augustinian foundation of ca. <date when="1120-00-00">1120</date>, removed from its original site nr. Skipton to its present site on the river Wharfe.</note> some 14 miles off: a beautiful enough place, but infested with Tourists and Picnicnic viewhunters; a to me wearisome drive. Let us henceforth decline the Picturesque.</p>
<p>Richard Milnes made me ride over to Fryston, some 20 and odd miles off; meeting me, at &#x201C;Oulton,&#x201C; on the other side Leeds: well enough; and I staid with them all night at Fryston, which also (except for want of sleep) was well enough:&#x2014;and more than this Milnes came up hither next day, to make acquaintance with Forster, and has now achieved it, and left us finally about an hour ago: very pleasant too, but again involving want of sleep for me!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster wrote to his Quaker friend Robert Barclay Fox (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400211-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:45</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-11">11 Feb. 1840</date></corr></ref>), whom TC knew through John Sterling, on the same day: &#x201C;Monckton Milnes came yesterday, and left this morning&#x2014;a pleasant companionable little man, well fed and fattening, with some small remnant of poetry in his eyes and nowhere else; delighting in paradoxes, but good-humoured ones; defending all manner of people and principles, in order to provoke Carlyle to abuse them, in which laudable enterprise he must have succeeded to his heart&#x2019;s content, and for a time we had a most amusing evening, reminding me of a naughty boy rubbing a fierce cat&#x2019;s tail backwards, and getting in between furious growls and fiery sparks. He managed to avoid the threatened scratches&#x201C; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:387).</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Basta</hi></foreign> [Enough], as to that matter.

I also send your <hi rend="italic">Weekly Times</hi> today.&#x2014; Alick, as you will find, has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> bought the land; and seems inclined to send the money home again. It partly strikes me, at first sight, that this is not altogether worth while; but I have not yet considered; and in any case, if you have a clear thought about the affair, I will follow that.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I sent a Newspaper, which would indicate to you that we are still here and well. Jenny&#x2019;s Letter came duly, with the welcome tidings, which we hope still holds good, that you were in your usual way again. We are very silent here; in a green wholesome country, among good friendly people who seem to enjoy our stay: we must not now linger very long; but are, were it only from natural laziness, somewhat averse to pack and take the road again!</p>
<p>This morning there came a Letter from Alick; conveying to us good news of their health, harvest &#x26;c; rather <hi rend="italic">short</hi>; and enclosing this Note to yourself from little Jane. The Letter I have sent on to Jack, with charge to transmit it to you directly. You will most likely get it in the space of another day. The Note from Jane I forward at once. There comes also a Newspaper, which I got this morning from Jack, with a little Note, charging me to tell you that he is well &#x26;c,&#x2014;as if he had not a pen of his own to tell that! He is very busy with his Printers, I suppose; but has a fair chance at them now in empty London.&#x2014; You would perhaps notice the frightful Steamboat explosion in the Thames: it is long now that I have been looking for some such thing; and I have accordingly avoided, for most part, getting into <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of the River Steamers at all for a good while past. I believe this is not the last of the accidents we shall hear of in that kind of craft. The &#x201C;Half-penny Steamers&#x201C; bragged that they were &#x201C;paying&#x201C; much better than any of the others: but it has proved a dear feat for them in the end! The common &#x201C;Twopennies&#x201C; too seem to me very dangerous; and I keep on land rather. You would read about that frightful murder in Paris?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of the duchess of Praslin.</note> It excels in atrocity and infernal quality all that we have heard of for a long while. France, especiall[y] in the upper classes of it, is said by everybody to be in a shocking state of unprincipled depravity; and new commotions are expected <pb id="pg-22-46" n="22:46"/>in it very confidently when once Louis Philippe<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), king of France, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">48</date>.</note> has ended his cunning work in this world. The Lady was in London some years ago, when her Father was Ambassador, and many persons knew her there.&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have been very quiet and quite stationary here; except that last week I rode away some 20 miles to see a Mr Milnes (with whom you remember I once made a visit, several years ago, in these parts): Milnes met me on the road (Jane would not go with me, preferring repose); I had a pleasant afternoon and night among the Milnes people; came home next day; and then <hi rend="italic">next</hi>, Milnes came up hither, and staid all night with us:&#x2014;it would have been extremely pleasant, and indeed was so; only I lost a good deal of sleep, and got, as I usually do in such cases, a decided <hi rend="italic">indigestion</hi>, with headache &#x26;c by the job! &#x201C;Quietness is best,&#x201C;&#x2014;decidedly it is.</p>
<p>Forster was called away yesterday into Lancashire, and is not to <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> back till dinner-time tomorrow: we are, in a curious way, masters of a House here till he return.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster saw TC as &#x201C;master&#x201C; of the house, and wrote to Barclay Fox, <date when="1847-08-27">27 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Catching such a visit is of course quite a trophy in life, but one accidental advantage would amuse you, viz., the salutary discipline of having a man in the house whose way is constantly consulted before my own; partly because he will have it, and partly because I prefer giving it him&#x201C; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">Life of Forster</hi> 1:210).</note> I went out yesterday, as I do almost every day, and had a long ride. The country is all broken into Hills, like Scotch Country; only here abouts there are <hi rend="italic">more</hi> hills than almost anywhere in the lowlands of Scotland, and no Mountains or very big Hills at all; and furthermore the Hills are ploughed for most part over the very top, and well worth ploughing; and lastly all the villages seem to stand <hi rend="italic">high up</hi> in the Country, the <hi rend="italic">bottom</hi> of the valley is mere gentlemen&#x2019;s Parks or common meadows, and has very often not even a road in it! We sit here far higher than on the Clint Hill,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 1 mi. N of Ecclefechan, 558 ft., on the road to Burnswark.</note> and see little, all round us, but hills on hills irregularly heaped together, but all fringed with rich wood, and beautifully green and yellow (just at present), evidently good land, and a capital wheat or oat crop getting carried off them. Within every mile or half-mile, moreover, there is visible on some hillside or hilltop a huge black-smoking chimney, and a <foreign><hi rend="italic">clachan</hi></foreign>, or village of spinners, planted round it; very ugly steep rude stone-villages, when you get into them: and Leeds and Bradford, visible by their smoke-clouds behind the high ground, are their <hi rend="italic">capitals</hi>; Leeds for broadcloths, Bradford for <hi rend="italic">worsteds</hi>, as I understand. I have been in both places; only <hi rend="italic">once</hi> in Bradford hitherto, but once, unless one have business, is often enough. The country, on account of its spinning and fertility, is very populous; people good-humoured, but rude; a rough <pb id="pg-22-47" n="22:47"/>and ready people: country full of roads; many of which (owing to the sites of villages, above alluded to) are very <hi rend="italic">steep</hi>, and rather inconvenient for riding.&#x2014; The weather for harvest is excellent, and all hands are busy; but yet not hands <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>, for the whole country seems ripe at once, and there is still a good deal of stuff to carry, and even a considerable proportion to cut. Today we have a kind of threatening to rain; last week (Saturday and Sabbath), when you had your storm as it appears, we had a violent <hi rend="italic">wind</hi>, droughty and nothing more.&#x2014; This is enough for our Yorkshire affairs and harvest: I wish I knew as well how the Scotsbrig is coming on! But I shall know before long, I hope, with my own eyes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What day wilt thou come, then?&#x201C; that is the question! Dear Mother, I do not yet know; but it will not be long,&#x2014;and, in fact, if I could get <hi rend="italic">smuggled</hi> away, and carried off in my <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, I believe I should vote for its being very soon; this night perhaps! Jane, as I said, decides to turn <hi rend="italic">South</hi> again, when I go off: this also rather detains me, for she seems to get on well here, and to have improved considerably since we left home. Forster, I clearly perceive, <hi rend="italic">enjoys</hi> our presence here; having a &#x201C;big house,&#x201C; and nothing to put in it when we are away. In a short time you shall hear of me again.</p>
<p>And so take care of yourself, dear Mother; and don&#x2019;t be <hi rend="italic">unwell</hi> when I come!&#x2014; I have taken to eating <hi rend="italic">potatoes</hi> again; some of them are rather good here, and it seems the rot is mostly off: be it so; I like it better so! <closer><salute>Remember us affectionately to one and all. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother. Ever your Son</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Almost ever since your last Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1847-06-04">4 June</date>.</note> reached me, I have been wandering over the country, enveloped either in a restless whirl of locomotion, viewhunting &#x26;c, or sunk in the deepest torpor of total idleness and laziness&#x2014;forgetting, and striving <supplied>[to]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> forget, that there was any world but that of dreams;&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; at intervals the reproachful remembrance has arisen sharply enough on me, that I ought, on all accounts high and low, to have <pb id="pg-22-48" n="22:48"/>written you an answer, never till today have I been able to take pen in hand, and actually begin that operation! Such is the naked fact. My Wife is with me; we have no household behind us but a servant; the face of England, with its mad electioneerings, vacant tourist dilettanteings, with its shady woods, green-yellow harvestfields and dingy mill-chimnies, so new and old, so beautiful and ugly, every way so <hi rend="italic">abstruse</hi> and <hi rend="italic">un</hi>speakable, invites to silence; the whole world, fruitful yet disgusting to this human soul of mine, invites me to silence; to sleep, and dreams, and stagnant indifference, as if for the time one had <hi rend="italic">got</hi> into the country of the Lotos-Eaters,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where idleness and oblivion were all; see <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> 9.</note> and it made no matter what became of anything and all things. In good truth, it is a wearied man, at least a dreadfully slothful and slumberous man, eager for <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> in any quantity, that now addresses you! Be thankful for a few half-dreaming words, till we awake again.</p>
<p>As to your visit to us, there is but one thing to be said and repeated: That a prophet&#x2019;s chamber is ready for you in Chelsea, and a brotherly and sisterly welcome, on whatever day at whatever hour you arrive: this, which is all of the Practical that I can properly take charge of, is to be considered a given quantity always. With regard to Lecturing &#x26;c, Ireland,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Ireland (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1894-00-00">94</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14445"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Manchester journalist who was helping to arrange Emerson&#x2019;s proposed tour of Britain; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470128-TC-JCH-01"><sic>21:147</sic><corr>TC to JCH, <date when="1847-01-28">28 Jan. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> with whom I suppose you to be in correspondence, seems to have awakened all this North Country into the fixed hope of hearing you,&#x2014;and God knows they have need enough to hear a man with sense in his head;&#x2014;it was but the other day I read in one of their Newspapers, &#x201C;We understand that Mr Emerson the distinguished &#x26;c is certainly &#x26;c this winter,&#x201C; all in due Newspaper phrase, and I think they settled your arrival for &#x201C;October&#x201C; next.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written favorably to James William Hudson of Leeds, of the Yorkshire Union of Mechanics Institutes (Rusk 3:407).</note> May it prove so! But on the whole there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no doubt of your coming; that is a great fact. And if so, I should say, Why not come at once, even as the Editor surmises? You will evidently do no other considerable enterprise till this voyage to England is achieved. Come, therefore;&#x2014;and we shall see; we shall hear and speak!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written: &#x201C;I must not come to London as a lecturer. &#x2026; I will come &#x26; see you &#x26; Jane Carlyle, and will hear what you have to say&#x201C; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 424).</note> I do not know another man in all the world to whom I can <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> with clear hope of getting adequate response from him: if I speak to you, it will be a breaking of my silence for the last time perhaps,&#x2014;perhaps for the first time, on some points! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Allons</hi></foreign> [Forward]. I shall not always be so roadweary, lifeweary, sleepy and stony as at present. I can think there is yet another Book in me; &#x201C;Exodus from Houndsditch&#x201C; (I think it might be called), a peeling off of fetid <hi rend="italic">Jewhood</hi> in <pb id="pg-22-49" n="22:49"/>every sense from myself and my poor bewildered brethren:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470623-TC-RB-01"><sic>21:241</sic><corr>TC to RB, <date when="1847-06-23">23 June 1847</date></corr></ref>, rejecting the Old Testament.</note> one other Book; and, if it were a right one, rest after that, the deeper the better, for evermore. <foreign>Ach Gott</foreign>!&#x2014;</p>

Emerson wrote a letter of introduction for him to TC, <date when="1847-06-02">2 June</date>, and then wrote TC, <date when="1847-06-04">4 June</date>: &#x201C;Henry Hedge is a recluse but catholic scholar in our remote Bangor, [Maine,] who reads German &#x26; smokes in his solitary study through nearly eight months of snow in the year, and deals out, every Sunday, his witty apothegms to the lumber-merchants &#x26; township-owners &#x2026;, who have &#x2026; shown themselves very loving &#x26; generous lately, in making a quite munificent provision for his travelling. Hedge has a true &#x26; mellow heart under that arid temperament, &#x26; I hope you will like him&#x201C; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 425).</note> A face like a rock; a voice like a howitzer; only his honest kind grey eyes reassure you a little. We have met only once; but hope (mutually, I flatter myself) it may be often by and by.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>As I am in extreme hurry I must content myself with a very few words today; but I send even a few, since Jack announces that it is I who am to write on this occasion.</p>
<p>Jane and I left home almost a month ago; have been lingering about in Derbyshire &#x26;c; and for the last fortnight and more, have been here on a visit to one Forster a young Bradford Manufacturer, who has very pleasant very quiet Country-quarters, is a most friendly cheerful man, and has long testified much desire to have us here. Jane seemed considerably worn out with the heats of London, and I considered it would do her good to get into the silence of the fields for a while. As it accordingly <supplied>[h]</supplied>as<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> proved; for I find her much amended at present, and indeed fully in her average state of health. We have had beautiful weather, and no evil accident at all has befallen us. It was from the first settled that I was to go on to Annandale; Jane too was eagerly invited, and at one time seemed to have thoughts of it; but she cannot yet resolve to revisit Scotland after her great losses there: so she turns homewards for Chelsea again, on the day when I set off for Manchester and Annandale. That is to be the day after tomorrow, as we at present calculate; which in part accounts for my hurry at present. Early next week, probably on Monday (it may even be <hi rend="italic">this</hi> week and on Saturday, if I find nobody that I like in Manchester), I expect to be in poor old Annandale again, and to see our dear old Mother once more. It is a sight for which one ought to thank Heaven, surely with one&#x2019;s whole soul: and yet to me it is always full of sorrow; and when the time comes to part again, it quite tears me to pieces for the moment, so that I could almost repent ever having come. O surely there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> some kind of higher reunion appointed for poor mortals who have honestly loved one another here, and yet could never much help one another, but had all to admit many times that their hearts were sore, and could only share their <hi rend="italic">sorrows</hi> together! God made <pb id="pg-22-51" n="22:51"/>us all; God will provide what is <hi rend="italic">good</hi> for us all, what is best for us all.&#x2014; But I may well change this strain.</p>
<p>We got your Letter here just three days ago: I sent little Jane&#x2019;s Note directly forward to our Mother, from whom (at least from Jean our Sister who is there) I have just got an answer this morning;&#x2014;which, as it is the very latest news from Scotsbrig, I enclose for you here. Your own Letter is also at Scotsbrig before now: I sent it to Jack, with charge to forward it from Chelsea; the small scraping of an <hi rend="italic">answer</hi>, which he has sent in return, I also enclose here.</p>
<p>He agrees with me in regret that you have not got the bit of land after all! There was of course no help; land with a doubtful <hi rend="italic">title</hi>, paid for by very indubitable money, would never have done. You did in all ways wisely to stop short till you were clearly satisfied on that head. Could or can the &#x201C;Land-agent,&#x201C; or Thomson,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> not <hi rend="italic">do</hi> anything to bring the matter into clearness? For instance, not get any indisputable person to <hi rend="italic">guarantee</hi> his sale, and hold <hi rend="italic">you</hi> harmless in case the title do misgive? I suppose, not. You will naturally be <hi rend="italic">very</hi> particular in regard to any such guarantee; and poor Thomson, I suppose, is a rather <hi rend="italic">dubious</hi> figure, on the other hand. So, unquestionably, you have done what was wise, and the only thing that was wise.&#x2014; As to the money, Jack agrees with me that there is no hurry at all about returning it hither; that if you can get it well <hi rend="italic">invested</hi> (I mean <hi rend="italic">safely</hi> first, all things are subordinate to that), it may lie there, bearing its bit of interest, till we see. As to remitting it in <hi rend="italic">corn</hi> or flour, that, as Jack says, will be a terribly unsafe operation just now! Our Corn-Merchants, who have flourished like the green bay-tree<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 37:35.</note> during last year of dearth, are now falling like the leaves in November: never such a time of &#x201C;Corn failures,&#x201C;&#x2014;amounting already to five millions of bankruptcy, some say! We have an excellent harvest here, all over Europe indeed, and are getting it some weeks earlier than was at one time expected. Do not invest money in <hi rend="italic">Corn</hi>, therefore. Put it by, as we said, in some safe place; and let us wait till we see.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470703-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1847-07-03">3 July</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Dear Brother, this is all that was essential, I think; and therefore, being in such bustle, I will now conclude. Jack, as before, is busy getting his <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> printed: one can learn nothing farther of him by all the bits of Notes he writes. I, as before, am still <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, so far as writing goes; I know not when I shall get well to work again,&#x2014;probably not till I get more <hi rend="italic">miserable</hi> than I am hitherto! On the whole, I am not in any hurry; not loath to <hi rend="italic">take</hi> a bit of <pb id="pg-22-52" n="22:52"/>sheer idleness, and of lying <hi rend="italic">fallow</hi> in the scribbling line.&#x2014; We rejoice to think of you and yours diligent in real work; honestly accomplishing what lies before you; and all kept <hi rend="italic">in a body</hi> (which is an immense consideration), the bits of <foreign>bairns</foreign> all busy round you each according to his strength.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your Note came just in time to be sent off to Alick, &#x201C;as the <hi rend="italic">latest</hi> news from Scotsbrig&#x201C;: I was writing to him Yesterday, the very day yours arrived. Thanks to you for your good news: good most of them, tho&#x2019; I wish Jenny and Jamie were a little better. Jack often writes a meagre line to me; he also is well.</p>
<p>If you had been to stay till Wednesday instead of Monday, I think you might have seen me at Scotsbrig: I do not yet <hi rend="italic">appoint</hi> any day; but that lies within the likelihoods.</p>
<p>We have fixed to leave <hi rend="italic">this</hi> on Monday: Saturday was to be the day, but Forster pleaded &#x26;c: so we go on Monday forenoon.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Sat. On Mon., soon after the Carlyles&#x2019; departure, Forster wrote to a friend: &#x201C;I miss them much. In spite of all, or rather through all, he certainly is a most delightful companion, a rich store of hearty, genial, social kindness shining through his assumed veil of misanthropy, and often all the more conspicuous from his efforts to conceal or disown it, and his eccentric humour striking laughter out of all manner of everyday trivial occurrences. What a fearful, fiend-like creature he would be in his dark moods, when the devil of dyspepsia is upon him, without this merciful safety-valve of humour! Nor, when I got accustomed to it, did I find his will by any means inconvenient. It is not one of those wills which chills or constrains me, capable indeed of strong fierce effort for opposition, but not a constant influence, of which the possessor is less conscious than any of those around him; so, after all, with tact one gets one&#x2019;s own way quite sufficiently with him. &#x2F; &#x2026; [One] effect [of TC&#x2019;s visit] has been to make me desire to sift my faith, not, I trust, in a frivolous sceptical temper, but in order to get yet firmer foothold, to strengthen my convictions, so that I may in future be able to meet him or his likes, not with a mere logical opinion, but with a living faith which might prove its own power&#x201C; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">Life of Forster</hi> 1:211&#x2013;12).</note> Jane, tending straight southward, has about an hour and half of railway work, to a place called Barnsley (near Sheffield, and itself a biggish Town), where some friends take her out;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Nodes Newton and family; see next letter. Barnsley, an industrial town ca. 10 mi. S of Leeds and 16 mi. N of Sheffield, was one of the main centers in Britain for linen manufacture.</note> only for one day, as she at present supposes; after which, <pb id="pg-22-53" n="22:53"/>4 hours more will bring her to London,&#x2014;&#x201C;to get the house scrubbed up&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c. I make for Manchester; am to arrive, if all go right, about 4 on Monday afternoon. It is likeliest I will stay all night. But if nobody be there that interests me, of course I will fling myself into the first <hi rend="italic">Ecclefechan</hi> train that I can hear of, and come rolling off; I should suppose about 6 hours would now bring one from Manchester: in that case I might see Scotsbrig on Tuesday! But that is not likely at all.&#x2014; I will write to my Mother from Manchester&#x2014;for Tuesday morning (if I can) or Tuesday evening (at Scotsbrig); if they do not hear on <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi> morning, it will be a sign that I am coming in person!&#x2014; But the next Letter (for a Letter will be better) is to say expressly.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane and I were for Leeds today, a huge smoky mon<supplied>[s]</supplied>ter<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> of a <hi rend="italic">broadcloth</hi> Town about 7 miles off;&#x2014;to see the Widow of one Dr Hunter a Cousin of hers,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Adam Hunter (d. <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), JWC&#x2019;s second cousin; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370620-TC-JCHA-01"><sic>9:232</sic><corr>TC to JCHA, <date when="1837-06-20">20 June 1837</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430108-JWC-JW-01"><sic>16:13</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1843-01-08">8 Jan. 1843</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430902-TC-JWC-01"><sic>17:107</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-09-02">2 Sept. 1843</date></corr></ref>.

The weather has been <hi rend="italic">eminent</hi> for harvest work all this while; hardly any rain at all, only loud wind for the last 3 days; but I suppose we shall come into the <hi rend="italic">water</hi> again directly on crossing the Lancashire Hills,&#x2014;rainy side of the &#x201C;Backbone of England&#x201C;!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Pennine range.</note> Dear Jean, whether you stay till Wednesday or go, I expect now to see you very soon. <closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

He and his wife, Sarah Ann Newton (b. <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>?), had three das. and three sons and lived at Longcar Cottage. His steam-powered linen factory, Piggott &#x26; Newton, at Shaw Mill, Longcar, at first concentrated on coarse linen for smock frocks, etc., and soon on weaving &#x201C;diapers, unions, drills or ticks&#x201C; (John Goodchild, <hi rend="italic">Golden Threads: the Barnsley Linen Industry in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries</hi> [<date when="1983-00-00">1983</date>] 260).</note> I northward thro&#x2019; Manchester and on to Scotsbrig without farther deflection. Jane, who contemplates only a night or so with the Newton, will be home some time <pb id="pg-22-54" n="22:54"/>early in the week: I too expect to be in Annandale about Tuesday or Wednesday, and to lie quiet there again.</p>
<p>There came a Letter from Jean, who is at Scotsbrig, yesterday: our Mother had been complaining of toothache, cold &#x26;c, but was now got into her usual state again: p<supplied>[oor?]</supplied> Mother, she is evidently very frail!</p>
<p>I enclosed that Note of Jean&#x2019;s, and your Note, in a Letter to Alick, which according to request I wrote and despatched yesterday.</p>
<p>You did not <supplied>[say]</supplied> nor does Varnhagen&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had corresponded with Varnhagen since <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date> and often sent him autographs for his collection. He was full of curiosity about the Carlyles, partly satisfied through his correspondence with Amalie B&#xF6;lte, whom he was able to see on her visit to Berlin about this time. He heard from her, at Berlin, <date when="1847-10-25">25 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I am very sorry that I missed seeing you on Friday, because I fear I may have given you a wrong idea about Mrs. Carlyle that I should have liked to correct. I admire this woman as the ideal of a pure heart and as the phenomenon of a nature which requires no mastery, because it appears to be without senses and without body. Free in every action that relates to the external world, whose opinion means nothing to her, she is constrained most scrupulously at every step by meticulousness conscientiousness. &#x2026; I could love her above all others&#x2014;possibly passionately&#x2014;if she did not have two other women friends. &#x2026; But how I shall live if she is no longer pleased with me, I hardly know. If only I could save her! But how?&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 48, trans.).</note> Letter say, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> the German Book specially is that has arrived: but I conclude it to be some Collection of Schiller&#x2019;s Letters to K&#xF6;rner;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>), German poet and playwright.

He &#x201C;was a friend of Miss Jewsbury&#x2019;s, and, accompanied by her and by me, Carlyle visited and carefully inspected the great tool-making works of that eminent mechanician.

One of them was a model of a knitting machine, &#x2026; which imitated so exactly the movements of the feminine fingers, with their final jerk, when knitting stockings, that Carlyle, contemplating it at work, burst into a hearty laugh. The other machine was one which could measure the millionth part of an inch, and a hair from each of the heads of the three visitors was subjected to its delicate admeasurement &#x2026;, [Carlyle&#x2019;s being] found to be the coarsest of the three&#x201C; (Espinasse 148).</note> and his place, a wonderful place and man;&#x2014;the true lodge of a &#x201C;human beaver.&#x201C; I have seen your Sharps,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sharp Bros. &#x26; Co., ironmongers, engineers, millwrights, and machinists, Atlas Works, 75 Gt.

<p>Here I am then, safe and sound! rather tired and as yellow as saffron with yesterday&#x2019;s journey; but that is all. I left Barnsley at one and got home at eleven, rather <hi rend="italic">low</hi> when I stopt at my own door all alone, but Anne received me with a little outburst of affection as cheering as it was unexpected. What you will consider more to the purpose, she had every thing in the nicest possible order, seemed really to have exerted herself to the uttermost in divining and executing my wishes&#x2014;a better cleaned house I never set my foot in, and even her own little person had bloomed out into new clothes for the occasion&#x2014; All the carpets have been not only up, and most effectually cleaned, and nailed down again, as nobody but myself <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> succeeded in nailing them before, but she has been at the <hi rend="italic">unbargained for</hi> pains to <hi rend="small-caps">darn</hi> them, wherever they needed it. Nay she has actually learnt to stand on <hi rend="italic">steps</hi>, and dusted every book on the shelves! <pb id="pg-22-59" n="22:59"/>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Piper too has been at work like a very Brownie&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Postie</hi> and she came at four oclock one morning and washed up all the blankets and counterpanes!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Piper and his wife. &#x201C;Our excellent, punctual and obliging postman, for above twenty years&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> and then the little post-woman herself fell upon the chair and table covers and having washed them quite beautifully nailed them all on again so that the whole house looks as bright as a new pin&#x2014;Postie had also helped to beat the carpets, considering that Eaves<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The ostler, turned out (seven or eight years after) to be a very great scamp&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> was rather <hi rend="italic">Slimming</hi> them; but he charged Anne to keep this and indeed all his doings a secret from me. To fall to work messing and painting <hi rend="italic">inside</hi>, now that every thing is so well cleaned, and so late in the year, would I think be &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">very</hi> absurd&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Brother John&#x2019;s phrase&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note>&#x2014; when the parlour <hi rend="italic">is</hi> new papered and painted it should be done. properly&#x2014;and proper painting, takes a prodigious time&#x2014;but I will see somebody tomorrow to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> at least concerning the <hi rend="italic">outside</hi>.</p>
<p>I have not seen John yet but he will come I suppose after his proofs are corrected&#x2014; Nobody else knows of my return, and I shall keep it &#x201C;a secret to please him&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;<foreign>Ou que manger un hareng?

Even the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1847-10-05">5 Oct.</date>, noted his death, recalling his implacable hostility to Daniel O&#x2019;Connell (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), the Irish politician who championed repeal of the Union between Ireland and Gt. Britain and who was &#x201C;his principal target,&#x201C; and said that though he had written nothing for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> for six or seven years he was said to be still on its payroll. Someone in the <hi rend="italic">Liverpool Courier</hi> was quoted as remembering his &#x201C;eye and beak of an eagle, quick to perceive and snuff &#x2026; every point in the political horizon.&#x201C;</note> Anne says he (Anthony) called here last saturday to ask the address and she gave him the Rawdon one&#x2014; The poor Old man had been quite insensible for a week before his death&#x2014;and the week before that, he had insisted on having himself brought to this door, tho even then he was <hi rend="italic">speechless</hi>! Anne said it was the sadest thing she ever saw&#x2014;he waved to her to come to him and made signs as if he were leaving a message for me&#x2014;pointed repeatedly to his lips and then to the house, and then shook his head with tears running down&#x2014; How often I have made a jest of <pb id="pg-22-60" n="22:60"/>that old mans affection for me&#x2014;and now it looks one of the most valuable affections I ever possessed for he clung to it till his last moment of consciousness&#x2014; His nurse who came with him told Anne she knew I was not at home&#x2014;but it was perfectly impossible to hinder his coming. Anthony, Anne says, seemed &#x201C;dreadfully cut up&#x201C; he &#x201C;could hardly speak to her for the tears in his throat.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Your letter was lying for me last night when I came in, and gave me somehow the feeling of a letter written out of Hades. I hope I shall get another soon&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hardly supposed your Manchester worshipers and least of all Geraldine would let you off on the Tuesday. As to me, I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not well have got home on the Wednesday, even if much set on it, which I was not. On Tuesday Nodes and his Wife took me thro two immense factories, and a long drive besides in a phaeton&#x2014;on the way home I was seized with one of my very worst fainting headachs and had to be <hi rend="italic">carried</hi> from the carriage to bed&#x2014;where I lay in what they took for a last agony till Midnight&#x2014; Nothing could be kinder than M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newton was, but kindness could do nothing till the time came&#x2014; Next day I got up to breakfast&#x2014;but too <hi rend="italic">brashed</hi> [sick] to dream of going off to London&#x2014;so I agreed to stay till Friday&#x2014;they would fain have had it Monday but, I could not be so silly as change my day twice.</p>
<p>My visit to Long car was a highly successful one except for that headach which might have happened anywhere</p>
<p>&#x2014;The children are beautiful loveable children, brought up, as children used to be in my time, and no trouble to anybody M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newton herself grows more attractive for me the more I see of her&#x2014;her quiet good sense and loving heartedness, and perfect naturalness are very refreshing to ones world-used soul&#x2014; Even poor Nodes is a much more interesting man at the head of his Mill and his family&#x2014;than when hanging loose on Society in London&#x2014;but it is twenty minutes after four&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>Let me send you one half word, to tell you the essential of my news. It was on Thursday afternoon that I quitted Manchester; the Carlisle rail, and Glasgow Coach, and finally my own feet, brought me hither shortly after midnight: here I have been, in the deepest indolence, oftenest sleeping or sleepy, ever since. Jane and I had started together on the Monday; but we parted at Leeds, she to the South, I to the Northwest: I expect she would arrive at Chelsea on Friday or Yesterday; but I have no express news of her farther than from her first station (Barnsley near Sheffield), where she was to stay a day or so with some friends. Tuesday next I expect to hear; tomorrow there is no post.</p>

<salute>Dear Geraldine,</salute>
<p>According to covenant, let me now apprise you of my safe arrival in these parts; no pitch of indolence should incapacitate me for a function such as that!</p>
<p>The Carlisle Railway, like a mere colt of a railway, not yet broken to work, proved very rough and jolty; stopped long at Preston, and did other misdemeanours; but nevertheless set me down, not far from its time, in that ancient city (built, they say, in the time of King Solomon, and very rainy at the moment of my arrival); after which I had to take to the Glasgow <hi rend="italic">Coach</hi>, the Scotch part of the line not being yet in action, after all! It is <pb id="pg-22-63" n="22:63"/>owing to some law controversies, they say, which could not be adjusted for a day or two. Not till after midnight was I set out in my native village; which looked abundantly strange to me; all sunk in sleep, in the pale ghastly twilight, rain dripping lazily from the eaves, and the poor inhabitants within all silent,&#x2014;most that I had known lying still more silent, in the Churchyard hard by. But the little Brook was singing as of old, the big huge shadow of the Earth was &#x201C;stretched beyond the Moon&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> ever as of old; and the universe in general was travelling its way: what could <hi rend="italic">I</hi> make of it, but unfurl my umbrella, and do the rest of my journey as speedily as possible on foot! At one o&#x2019;clock, I was in my old Mother&#x2019;s house, and half an hour after, sound asleep: which ends my history for the present; sleep, sleep, and the nearest attainable approach to silence, being all I have attempted ever since.</p>
<p>Of Manchester, and the warm welcome that greeted me there, and the strange things and interesting persons I saw, a vivid, grateful, and I daresay fruitful, remembrance remains with me: I feel as if a great black mass, with bright streaks in it too, but black and inarticulate generally, had got into my mind; and would require to be long manipulated, and held in solution, before I could fully get the meaning of it out. The meaning of it? Alas, nobody knows in the least the full meaning of it; Manchester itself as little as any one! A huge roaring, smouldering, <hi rend="italic">unconscious</hi> thing; very ill off, even now, for some small knowledge of itself! Neither do I regret the Wednesday&#x2019;s mistake;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of missing the train; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470911-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1847-09-11">11 Sept.</date></ref></note> it brought, among other things, Bamford and the Brights into my sack; curious phenomena both, which I should have missed otherwise. Kind thanks to all kind Friends, to yourself and your good Brothers, first of all, whose trouble with me, whose eagerness to do all hospitalities to me, how shall I sufficiently acknowledge.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The eldest, Thomas Jewsbury (b. <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>), and Henry, both married, and Frank, with whom she lived; there was another brother, Arthur; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400412-TC-GEJ-01"><sic>12:104</sic><corr>TC to GEJ, <date when="1840-04-12">12 April 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> I have only a poor exchequer of thanks at present; and must beg you to be my <hi rend="italic">chancellor</hi>,&#x2014;which is a nice little office for you, I think!</p>
<p>There lay a Note from Barnsley for me here; indicating that Friday was to be the last day in that region: nothing has come since; but I suppose a Note from Chelsea now must be under way. You, I have no doubt, will write;&#x2014;Brother Frank and you, let us hope, did not take the rail in person to Barnsley that day! And my faithful Achates and Namesake,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Achates, usually styled &#x201C;<foreign>Fidus</foreign> [faithful] Achates,&#x201C; friend of Aeneas.</note> whom I left unwell, what has become of him? A certain remorse haunts me, that the fatigues on that day of sights would make a bad combination with the <pb id="pg-22-64" n="22:64"/>official <hi rend="italic">mutiny</hi> I heard you speak of! But we cannot help it.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I was to write to Jane today; but not yet knowing whether she has actually reached Chelsea, I may as well address myself to you, to whom I owe some kind of note at any rate: you can step down to Chelsea, and communicate if there be anybody there. Jane had a slight word from me yesterday to say that I was arrived and safe, and all well here.</p>
<p>At Manchester, which I reached last Monday afternoon, no creature could inform me as to the Carlisle and Beattock trains; and indeed I found it was for a very good reason,&#x2014;that, in spite of the Newspapers, there were no trains yet running! I had to go therefore on venture; went on Thursday by the evening mail train to Carlisle, did the remainder in the Glasgow Mail, and leaving my baggage in the Coach-stable at Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> about the hour of midnight, finished my dark pilgrimage on foot under my umbrella, and <hi rend="italic">roused</hi> the people here! Poor old Middlebie, poor old native Annandale in general, looked impressive enough, all asleep, in the dead wet silence. I tumbled into bed; and awoke at 9 next morning, just as Jamie&#x2019;s man had got my luggage home; my good old Mother, who had not heard me the night before, stood waiting with her welcome. She is not worse than usual; she is a little better rather; and looks as well, and has as much strength and spirit as I had any reason to expect.</p>
<p>Ever since I have remained abundantly stationary; not walking in all three miles yet, I think, tho&#x2019; the weather has occasionally been quite bright and inviting. I find this room (the East one) greatly improved by your means; yesternight, in very unfavourable wind and rain, I knocked up your smoke-slider, and found it act almost perfectly, indeed altogether well,&#x2014;thanks with both hands, to General Wade!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >General George Wade (<date when="1673-00-00">1673</date>&#x2013;<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>), who, as commander-in-chief in Scotland, <date when="1726-00-00">1726</date>, began building roads and bridges prompting the verse &#x201C;Had you seen these roads before they were made, / You would lift up your hands and bless General Wade.&#x201C;.</note> Jamie is very busy with <pb id="pg-22-65" n="22:65"/>his harvest; six ricks safely in, three days more to cut with his scythes; and a crop much weightier than he expected before actually entering on it. The weather has been eminently good, for Annandale, and still continues good or hopeful. I have seen nobody here, and done nothing; have therefore no detail of news to give you. Poor unfortunate Mary Carlyle (Harkness) had died, about six hours before my arrival in Ecclefechan; was lying a pale corpse there as I looked out upon it from the Coach-window, had I known what was within it! Here<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> illness, or special illness had been of some three weeks, nobody here had heard of it, nor was the end expected till it came. Jamie went to the funeral yesterday afternoon. They were very poor; poor Mary&#x2019;s life was every way a thing which it could be little loss to quit; but life is sweet to all: the poor Husband, lying sick at present, looked over the window, Jamie says, in nightcap and plaid, and &#x201C;<foreign>grat</foreign> [wept].&#x201C; <foreign>Eheu</foreign>!</p>

<p><salute>My Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>I conjecture you would get a Note from me, the shortest in the world, yesterday (Monday) morning; and in the evening probably John would come down to you with farther no-news. I might have written again yesterday to the like effect, but little Tait, the Burgher Minister,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Tait (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">67</date>), minister at Ecclefechan since <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>.</note> presented himself in the afternoon, and there was no more work to be thought of; hardly, after dark, and by industry and sleight-of-hand, could a retreat be effected, up the steep public road, and an hour&#x2019;s solitary walking get itself accomplished. I had, at any rate, nothing but what you already knew to tell you,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I wished, too, to tell you that same nothing; as I am now about to do.</p>
<p>Jamie and I got your Letter, as we went out for an evening stroll, in the grey wind, and took Middlebie on our road. Thanks, little Dearie: it was very good news to hear you had arrived at our own little nest again, and found all in such applepie order, and poor little Anne so brisk and good. Qualities like those in the little body do cover a multitude of defects in the strength of the back. Postie too, and Mrs Postie certainly deserve all recognition!&#x2014; And now, I suppose, you are busy getting some small furbishing accomplished on the outside of that dim House: the door, the windows and railing you can paint at any rate; and there, so far as my conjecture goes, the resources of science for the year end. But I do not know; you know who are on the spot: thou will do all things dextrously, I doubt not, and so soon as I get to Dumfries, there shall be money sent to pay. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Perge</hi></foreign> [Continue], Goody!</p>
<p>Bamford, who entered literally at the end of my Manchester sheet, gave me real satisfaction. A right strapping piece of Lancashire Plebianhood: big head, on the tall perpendicular figure, looking more honesty and energy; the little frank-fearless eyes; the big cheekbones (such as I recollect on Cobbett&#x2019;s mask,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Cobbett (<date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), radical writer, politician, and agriculturist. There is no known death mask. A model of his profile for a medallion was made by Peter Rowe, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>, and an engraved print of the model was widely circulated. Upon his death the medallion was cast. See L. S. Benjamin, <hi rend="italic">Life and Letters of &#x2026; Cobbett</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1913-00-00">1913</date>), 2:illus. facing 230; and Asa Briggs, <hi rend="italic">William Cobbett</hi> (Oxford, <date when="1967-00-00">1967</date>), plate 11.</note> and on certain living faces) denoting endless obstinacy; the high Lancashire dialect, with its antique rustic &#x201C;thou&#x2019;s&#x201C; and &#x201C;thee&#x2019;s&#x201C;: all pleased me heartily well. We talked largely; in all respects well on Bamford&#x2019;s side; especially when I could keep him to narrative, to description of <pb id="pg-22-67" n="22:67"/>old times and things, in all which he shone with his full force of natural sense. Geraldine took us up stairs, before long, to the Lady visitor she had; a Mrs Col.

Good old Bamford! He asked, with all sincerity of tone, for you; seems to like Geraldine also. After a time the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> squadron gradually assembled; and we all took ourselves off, out of Geraldine&#x2019;s way, to Ballantyne&#x2019;s, nearer the Station; where hospitable &#x201C;bread and cheese&#x201C; was ministered me by way of dinner, and escort in due time by the whole party to my Carlisle station, where I took final leave of Bamford and the rest. Not a man of much or indeed of almost any &#x201C;genius,&#x201C; but a man of real sense, integrity and courage, which is a much better outfit. I promised him all the help I could yield in getting a London Bookseller for the &#x201C;Autobiography&#x201C; he talks of being busy with.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Early Days</hi> (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>, <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>).</note> &#x201C;Write to me when it is done,&#x201C; said I.&#x2014; &#x201C;I wool,&#x201C; answered Bamford with emphasis; and so we parted.&#x2014; Geraldine we found again at the station, come down with her Lady, whom she was despatching (nothing loath, I privately conjecture, for the poor Lady had loud redhaired brats of children too) towards Ireland and her ulterior destinies. Geraldine was the most hospitable of hostesses; her Brothers too used inconceivable alacrity to discharge the sacred rites: do you thank her and them; I have already done so since I arrived here. Frank seemed to me a very gentlemanly amicable kind of figure; in Tom also, tho&#x2019; his breeding savoured more of the commercial h&#xF4;tel, I found many hearty qualities, and certainly ample room for thanks.&#x2014; On the whole, I in no wise can regret my journey round by Manchester, or my stay there; much is laid up in me from that short survey. The Mills, O the fetid fuzzy, deafening ill-ventilated mills! And, in Sharps cyclopean Smithy,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470909-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1847-09-09">9 Sept.</date></ref></note> do you remember the poor &#x201C;Grinders&#x201C;? Sitting underground, in a damp dark place, some dozen of them: over their screeching stone-cylinders; from every cylinder a sheet of yellow <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> issuing, the principal light of the place;&#x2014;and the men, I was told, and they themselves knew it, and &#x201C;did not mind it,&#x201C; were all or mostly <hi rend="italic">killed</hi> before their time, the lungs being ruined by the metal and stone dust! Those poor fellows, in their paper caps, with their roaring grindstones and their yellow <foreign><hi rend="italic">oriflammes</hi></foreign> of fire, all grinding themselves so <pb id="pg-22-68" n="22:68"/>quietly to death, will never go out of my memory.&#x2014; In signing my name, as I was made to do, on quitting that Sharp Establishment whose name, think you, stood next, to be succeeded by mine?

I will tell you about Bright and Brightdom and the Rochdale Bright Mill, some other day. <hi rend="italic">Jacob</hi> Bright, the younger man, and actual manager at Rochdale, rather pleased me: a kind of delicacy in his heavy features when you saw them by daylight,&#x2014;at all events, a decided element of &#x201C;hero-worship,&#x201C; which of course went for much! But <hi rend="italic">John</hi> Bright, the Anti-cornlaw Member, who had come across to meet me, with his squat stout body, with his cock-nose and pugnacious eyes, and Barclay-Fox Quaker collar,&#x2014;John and I discorded in our views not a little! And in fact the result was that I got to talking, occasionally in the <hi rend="italic">Annandale</hi> accent, and communicated large masses of my views to the Brights and Brightesses,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The sisters, Priscilla (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1906-00-00">1906</date>), Margaret (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890-00-00">90</date>), and Esther (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">50</date>); the other brothers were Thomas (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890-00-00">90</date>), Gratton (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>), and Samuel (<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>). Priscilla, who kept house for John till his marriage in <date when="1847-06-00">June</date>, wrote in her old age about TC&#x2019;s outburst: &#x201C;I forget what we were discussing at our high tea, but my brother John strongly dissented from our distinguished visitor &#x2026; . Philanthropic efforts next came on, and Carlyle ridiculed Elizabeth Fry [(<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), Quaker social reformer,] and her work. / Elizabeth Fry ranked in my mind as an earthly Saviour, and I gave vent, with all the moral courage I possessed to the disappointment I felt that one whose judgment might have so much weight should speak against her efforts and self-denying life &#x2026;, and I begged that before young men especially he would always advocate the highest aims for the good of others. Carlyle took it all very kindly; perhaps he thought our simple, innocent minds were not worth contending with! &#x2026; However, the cynical gave place to an almost angelic mood and expression for the rest of the evening&#x201C; (J. Travis Mills, <hi rend="italic">John Bright and the Quakers</hi> [<date when="1935-00-00">1935</date>] 268&#x2013;69).</note> and shook peaceable Brightdom as with a passing earthquake,&#x2014;and I doubt left a very questionable impression of myself there! The poor young ladies (Quaker or Ex-quaker), with their &#x201C;abolition of Capital Punish<hi rend="italic">t</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;ach, Gott! I had a great remorse of it all that evening; but now begin almost to think I served them right. Any way, <hi rend="italic">we cannot help it</hi>. So there it, and Lancashire in general, may lie, for the present.</p>
<p>I found no Letters here, except yours, and one from Fitzgerald, which I will send some day when the <hi rend="italic">Cover</hi> will bear: it is not worth a penny-stamp to you, tho&#x2019; fair in its way. Anthony Sterling had not written to Rawdon, I think, after all. Poor old Sterling gone at last! He is a <hi rend="italic">different</hi> figure to us now henceforth while we live to remember him, never more a ridiculous <pb id="pg-22-69" n="22:69"/>figure, but a sad and solemn one. That scene at the door, as Anne described it to you, it is the last of his &#x201C;scenes&#x201C;; a stern reality that, as well as a scene! Gone, gone: they are all gone now, but Anthony and a mad jealous woman;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Sterling&#x2019;s wife, Charlotte, b.

How swiftly, how infallibly, the scene-machineries in this huge theatre of a world, furl themselves up, at the hour; and it is a &#x201C;new art,&#x201C; and the old landscape and its population are away&#x2014;away! God is great. My Mother has been sitting behind me, all this while, reading Spalding&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History</hi>,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Spalding, <hi rend="italic">History of the Troubles and Memorable Transactions in Scotland</hi>, 2 vols.

He is much more taciturn than when you saw him last; and indeed I believe is not well in health in these months.&#x2014; Jenny has washed all my things as white as snow: I have just <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> shirts here;&#x2014;I partly thought there had been <hi rend="italic">eleven</hi>, but never anywhere could get them counted. Today we expect the Newspapers, in an hour (about 2 o&#x2019;clock); a decided event for us.

The railway is in action; I see it sometimes puffing along, and have heard the scream of it thro&#x2019; the hollow night: but it does not yet bring the mail from Carlisle, the Glasgow Coach is still the functionary thence northward.</p>
<p>For the rest, dear Goody, I am as idle as the winds; I do nothing, not even read.

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>Your Letter lay waiting me here, when I arrived, the other night: thanks for your remembrance of me, for your pleasant glimpses into life in the Southwest.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1847-08-00">Aug.</date> FitzGerald had visited Devon, Somerset, and Gloucestershire.</note> I write a word today to satisfy you about Spedding; whom indeed I have not seen or directly communicated with, but of whom I heard lately from Marshall of Leeds, his neighbour in the North Country, and a sure hand.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Spedding (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26090"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) had retired from the colonial office to study Francis Bacon; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430312-JWC-JW-01"><sic>16:80</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1843-03-12">12 March 1843</date></corr></ref>. He was apparently staying with his father, John (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), at Mirehouse, Cumbria.

<p>As for myself I have been a pilgrim, tho&#x2019; a lazy one, ever since you heard from me: a visitor of Dovedale; of Buxton, with its bottomless tedium; of the Spar Caves, Tors, and the Devil&#x2019;s&#x2014;(establishment) i&#x2019;Peak: next a sojourner for some time on one of the hilltops of Yorkshire Airedale; then in Manchester for some days; and finally was flung down here, out of the Glasgow Coach and Carlisle rail, after midnight, on Thursday last; where I have rested since, the idlest of all men.</p>
<p>I will tell you many things about my Derbyshire Spar-Caves and etceteras, whenever I find you disposed over a pipe, and capable of such details. The Spar-Caves indeed are an indubitable bore: but Derbyshire in itself I found a really interesting country, and was well pleased to look upon it. Beautiful old grey villages, silent as churchyards; fresh green moors wild limestone cliffs and chasms;&#x2014;and, above all things, a cleanly, diligent, welldoing population, in whom, as in a <hi rend="italic">living</hi> Bank of England, one could trace the funded virtues of many generations of humble good men. I found the Grave of Richard Arkwright (no monument, no name or date to him); I found, at Cromford, the earliest Cotton-Mill in the world, the &#x201C;Mother of all the Mills&#x201C;; Richard&#x2019;s great-grandson has let it fall almost silent now. In the northern quarter of the Shire, I sought for James Brindley&#x2019;s baptismal register, and exact birthplace; but could not yet find it: no man had ever <pb id="pg-22-71" n="22:71"/>heard of Brindley, his place knew him not, knew not that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> had turned England upside down! In Manchester I saw&#x2014; But not a word more, except the mere <hi rend="italic">names</hi> of Ex-Quaker Bright the Member, and Bamford the Radical; that you may long to meet me the more!</p>
<p>How long I shall be here I know not: if you were still at Bedford as I came past, it would be a great temptation to me to pause.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald had gone, <date when="1847-09-09">9 Sept.</date>, to Bedford to visit his friend William Kenworthy Browne (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450617-TC-AC-01"><sic>19:82</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1845-06-17">17 June 1845</date></corr></ref>), and stayed there till the second week of <date when="1847-10-00">Oct.</date></note> We shall see.&#x2014; Mrs C. parted from me at Leeds a week ago; she is now home and safe: I went the other way, half an hour after. Railways are becoming my abomination!&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>; and love the Man of Ross and me.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Kyrle (<date when="1637-00-00">1637</date>&#x2013;<date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>), philanthropist of Ross, Herts., known as the Man of Ross; see Pope, <hi rend="italic">Moral Essays</hi>, Epistle 3:249&#x2013;50. Apparently sending TC&#x2019;s letter to a friend, <date when="1847-09-20">20 Sept.</date>, FitzGerald said: &#x201C;Was not Carlyle&#x2019;s letter a good one? I want him to see yet more of the English <hi rend="italic">country</hi>, and I think he would modify some of his views. Doubtless all these impressions of Derbyshire will come out in print ere long: I can see by his letter that his thoughts are settling towards some such consummation&#x201C; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:579).</note> <closer><salute>Kind regards to Mr Browne.</salute></closer></p>

<p>Now is not this really to bad? You said in that scrap of a note you would write next day; and here is the second day and no letter <hi rend="italic">yet</hi>!&#x2014; I cannot fancy &#x201C;drinking new milk under various forms&#x201C; such hard work, but that you might find a vacant hour to tell me a little more of your history since we parted at Leeds! Expecting the Postman is the sole interest of my day, for I can expect nobody else, nobody else knowing I am come&#x2014;and he goes past just as if the house were shut up!&#x2014; I have not felt the solitude at all oppressive as yet; indeed if I had had plenty of <hi rend="italic">letters</hi>, I should have &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">enjoyed</hi>&#x2019; it rather than otherwise. But except on Monday the Postman has not once called. On Monday besides your morsel of a note there were <hi rend="italic">three</hi> letters from Barnsley&#x2014;that gave me the feeling of being &#x201C;in a madhouse&#x201C;&#x2014; Both Betsey&#x2014;that is, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet, and Geraldine had streamed off on the Friday to see me; found themselves to their mutual astonishment sitting face to face in the omnibus; and had the mortification to arrive just three hours too late! To neither of them had it ever occurred that there was &#x201C;a certain&#x201C; awkwardness in making their <hi rend="italic">first</hi> visit to Mrs Newton, after she had been <hi rend="italic">ten years</hi> Nodes&#x2019;s wife, entirely for the sake of another person. The very natural exclamation she received them with, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">she is gone</hi>! brought them, especially M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet, to a due sense of this, and there they were, feeling, they said as <hi rend="italic">foolish</hi> as vexed. and, what was more to the purpose, determined to behave differently to Nodes&#x2019;s wife in future; now that they saw how thoroughly they had mistaken her, and that she was in fact &#x201C;too good for him.&#x201C; All this was told with such distracted-looking hurry and flurry&#x2014;that I had to walk up and down the room for half an hour after to calm my mind.</p>
<p>It may do M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet much good to see her sister-in laws management of her house and children&#x2014;and Geraldine will be none the worse to observe how interesting and loveable a woman may be, without having ever read a line of George Sand or dreamt of anything of the sort.</p>
<p>Nodes took me all thro his factory, and gave me a beautiful cover for our stair-carpets&#x2014;he also talked enthusiastic things about wishing &#x201C;to dress Carlyle in <hi rend="italic">Barnsley drills</hi> next summer.&#x201C; His <hi rend="italic">House</hi> indicating rather <pb id="pg-22-73" n="22:73"/>limited means, and himself rather limited brains; my surprise was great to find <hi rend="small-caps">his</hi> <hi rend="italic">Factory</hi> the most perfect thing of the sort I had yet seen&#x2014; Not so <hi rend="italic">large</hi> as Marshall&#x2019;s of course;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J.

<p>I have seen John just twice&#x2014;he came on Sunday forenoon&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> minutes! &#x201C;had a cold&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;perhaps had better go home and take care of it&#x201C;&#x2014; On Monday, in case of his not being <hi rend="italic">able</hi> to come, I called for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, he walked home with me thro&#x2019; the rain, had a tumbler of punch with me, and then &#x201C;had to take the road again&#x201C;&#x2014; When he speaks of his Dante&#x2014;and he speaks of little else&#x2014;his countenance assumes a sort of <hi rend="italic">august</hi> expression that is almost imposing.

<p>I have spoken to a Painter about the front of the house, and he promised to bring me an estimate this morning&#x2014;but has &#x201C;failed in his truth&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note>&#x2014;like some others&#x2014;I have an immensity of sewing on hands&#x2014;am taking the front room bed-curtains in pieces that they may be cleaned and new-lined for Emerson.

<p>When no letter came this morning either at nine or eleven (for your last came at eleven) I vowed I would not write to you for a week&#x2014;then I relented and resolved to write just a dozen lines of protest&#x2014;and there I have written a tolerably long letter&#x2014;</p>

<dateline>Thursday [<date when="1847-09-16">16 September 1847</date>]</dateline>
<p>Here are three notes for you Dear, and I cannot send them without a few lines from myself tho up to the ears in my <hi rend="italic">curtains</hi>.</p>
<p>If I had waited paitently a few hours longer yesterday, I might have spared you a <hi rend="italic">shrewing</hi>. Your nice <hi rend="italic">long</hi> letter came in the evening, and before <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, I had also seen John and been favoured with a reading of your letter to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>; I could have found in my heart to box his ears, when I found it had been in his pocket since monday night, and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> only told of it <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, at three oclock on Wednesday. After my <hi rend="italic">remonstrance</hi> was gone to the Postoffice. He did not seem to consider my impatience in the meanwhile &#x201C;of the slightest consequence&#x201C;&#x2014;in fact he is for the moment &#x201C;a miserable wretch lost in <hi rend="italic">proofsheets</hi>&#x201C;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x201C;Lost in statistics,&#x2019; said old Sterling, of a certain philosopher here&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note>&#x2014; He reminds me of the grey-chicken at Craigenputtoch that went about for <hi rend="italic">six-weeks</hi> cackling over its first egg&#x2014; If everybody held such a racket over his <hi rend="italic">book</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> over this <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> of his; the world would be perfectly uninhabitable! But he comes seldom, and has always to &#x201C;take the road again&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">in a few minutes</hi>; so I manage to endure the <hi rend="italic">cackling</hi> with <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> stoicism&#x2014;</p>
<p>Nothing has happened to me since yesterday except that in the evening I was startled&#x2014;almost terrified by&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">a knock at the door</hi>!&#x2014; It was Fuz!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster.</note> I had <pb id="pg-22-75" n="22:75"/>written to him about G&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Geraldine&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> manuscript, and he answered my note in person by return of Post! I had expected &#x201C;a gentle and free passage of <hi rend="italic">pennies</hi>,&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Penny-post letters.</note> extending thro&#x2019; perhaps a fortnight; before a meeting actually came off! He seemed very strong-hearted for <hi rend="italic">the reading</hi>&#x2014;which could not however be commenced last night; for he had to attend the sale of Shakespeares house<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Committees at Stratford-on-Avon (on which Dickens and Forster were prominent) had been set up to raise funds to buy for the nation Shakespeare&#x2019;s traditional birthplace in Henley St.; it was sold to them, <date when="1847-09-16">16 Sept.</date>, for &#xa3;3,000.</note>&#x2014;but on Sunday evening &#x201C;by all that was sacred&#x201C; we would fall to in earnest, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">trusting in God</hi>, that on that night he should find me in good voice&#x201C; Meanwhile &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">were</hi> there any <hi rend="italic">books</hi>&#x2014;any thing <hi rend="italic">on earth</hi> I wished&#x201C;? He would send Henry<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry E. Rawlins, Forster&#x2019;s factotum.</note> today&#x2014; He staid only half an hour&#x2014;very <hi rend="italic">fat</hi>!</p>
<p>This morning a still greater terror struck into me&#x2014;when a carriage stopt at the door while I was sitting at breakfast in my dressing-gown. It was Anthony Sterling on his way from Headly<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Headley Grove, his farm on the downs nr. Betchworth, Surrey.</note>&#x2014;he did not offer at coming in&#x2014;merely sent the servant to ask if I would be at home in the afternoon&#x2014; I am glad he is coming; for&#x2014;I will get him to send me his Painter the one who was to bring me an estimate having never returned. I walked up to the Library yesterday to get myself&#x2014;if possible&#x2014;something to read&#x2014; White Owl<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Poor old Cochrane, our first librarian of London Library, and essentially the builder and architect there. The only real bibliographer I have ever met with in Britain&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> expected to day&#x2014; Library &#x201C;too bad for <hi rend="italic">anything</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; Officials mortal <hi rend="italic">drunk</hi> or worse&#x2014;overtaken with incureable idiocy! Not a book one could touch without getting oneself made beastly!&#x2014; I expressed my horror of the scene and was answered &#x201C;are you aware mam of the death of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Cochran&#x201C;!</p>
<p>I brought away the last four numbers of <hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thackeray&#x2019;s novel was pbd. in monthly pts., <date when="1847-01-00">Jan. 1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-07-00">July 1848</date>.</note>&#x2014;and read one of them in bed&#x2014;duringing<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> the night.

<p>Chambers is now raising brick fabrics&#x2014;perfectly incomprehensible in their meaning hitherto&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">front</hi> of his house.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Turned out to be a porch and pillars&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).

<salute>Dear Jeannie,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your good long Note, flung off to me tho&#x2019; I did not deserve it. &#x201C;She can make a Letter out of anything, and is always pleasant to read!&#x201C; By the evening post, that day, you would find I had not been quite so faithless: even John&#x2019;s Letter, which he was charged to shew you instead of the one due to yourself, does not seem to have been known to you at the time of your writing. Poor fellow! Let him be as &#x201C;august&#x201C; as he can, and take all the blessedness out of his poor <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> that it will yield him! A small bit of work, that same; and the fruit of terrible circuitous efforts,&#x2014;about as bewilderingly &#x201C;circuitous&#x201C; as any we have seen in our sphere: let it stand there, and let us &#x201C;take the road again&#x201C;!</p>
<p>I have written to Thomas Erskine<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8875"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Scottish theologian, former advocate, and friend of TC&#x2019;s; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380201-TC-JAC-01"><sic>10:18</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1838-02-01">1 Feb. 1838</date></corr></ref>. Erskine wrote, <date when="1847-09-23">23 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;My note &#x2026; called out two responses&#x2014;yours &#x26; one from Mrs Carlyle, which amongst other matters, contained sketches of pleasant quaker life in Yorkshire. By chance we had a young curate of Bradford with us, who knew Mr Forster &#x26; his perilous horse, which it appears tried its hand on Mrs Carlyle.&#x201C;.</note> today (did you ever write?)&#x2014;half a Note, the first portion of which I was absolutely too lazy to do more than fling down unfinished yesterday. My inertia, my grey hazy dispiritment, fit for nothing but tobacco and silence, is great this day; in fact I am not well, <pb id="pg-22-77" n="22:77"/>and did not sleep: so take this line, with no meaning in it, and say, &#x201C;The poor soul would have sent me more if he had had it.&#x201C; That is the fact.</p>
<p>Nothing can be emptier of any event, or writeable thing whatever, than my existence here: an absolute stagnation, and magnetic sleep,&#x2014;which I esteem wholesome, and rather like for the present. We have few or no topics here which in the least interest me; for my Mother is terribly sensitive on <hi rend="italic">the Semitic</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., biblical.</note> side of things, which mostly excludes speculation; and of history, except it be small snatches of poor biography, waxing yearly scantier, what can there be? I find hardly half-a-dozen persons living whom I have ever known, in this region: in my own country I am solitary as in a foreign land; and have more than ever, in looking over it, the feelings of a ghost! My Books too are very dull; Turner&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Anglosaxons</hi> is unfortunately the Book of a Blockhead:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sharon Turner, <hi rend="italic">History of the Anglo-Saxons</hi>, 4 vols. (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>).</note> alas, the Earth is <hi rend="italic">full</hi> of Blockheadisms and Blockheads! One has only one&#x2019;s &#x201C;tobacco,&#x201C; and one&#x2019;s own private thought.&#x2014; &#x2014; Did I mention, last Letter, that Jenny had a neighbour in Maxwelltown, some poor but reputable old woman, from Keir Parish, who remembered being at school in childhood with your Father,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh (1775?&#x2013;1819), JWC&#x2019;s father, born at Craigenputtoch; his school was probably, as TC guessed, at Tynron (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 95).</note>&#x2014;sixty years back and more! Janet (?) <hi rend="italic">Dargavel</hi> is her maiden name; her Father, then a substantial Farmer, was an elder of the Parish, but died early, and they all sank gradually lower, down low enough: your Grandfather of Penfillan<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh (1757?&#x2013;1823), JWC&#x2019;s paternal grandfather; see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 90&#x2013;95. The Dargavels not further identified.</note> used to meet the two children coming from school, and &#x201C;joke his eldest son with her!&#x201C; I fancy this story may be a truth;&#x2014;an <hi rend="italic">epic</hi> glimpse for you, my poor little lassie, into the <hi rend="italic">preternatural</hi> Past Time. <hi rend="italic"><foreign>Ay de mi</foreign></hi>!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321016-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:241</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-10-16">16 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>On Monday night there is to be a <foreign>kirn</foreign> [harvest home festivity] held here, from which it will be necessary that I get into some shelter. Dumfries that day is my likeliest outlook. I recoil at the long drive, or long ride, on that light airy pony of Jamie&#x2019;s (which I have ridden once, and am to ride for a <hi rend="italic"><foreign>pisaller</foreign></hi> [last resort]); I hope to get some &#x201C;railway omnibus,&#x201C; which I understand there is from Lockerby: wish me well! Great store of flannels, of clothes &#x26;c &#x26;c are to be purchased; such is my stern destiny. By a stout heart set to the steep brae [hill],<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial; cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300211-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:72</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-02-11">11 Feb. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> I shall get thro&#x2019; it, shall I not? Aird, they tell me, is grown terribly <hi rend="italic">fat</hi>. Lazy enough he has been; lazy in mind to the verge of absolute stupor. What a lonely mortal am I grown, among the sons <pb id="pg-22-78" n="22:78"/>of Adam that walk the Earth along with me! Cannot help it; am likely to grow ever lonelier, if I don&#x2019;t mind.</p>

<dateline><place>Dumfries</place>, <date when="1847-09-20">20 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (Monday) 1847</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>O my Dear,</salute> what a whirl of confusion I am in; all tattered to pieces by noise and business and uproar of various kinds; hardly able to scratch down for you the smallest intelligible word! Here is a little money for you, at any rate; <hi rend="italic">this day week</hi> (Monday <hi rend="italic">first</hi> after reading it), the Bankers at <hi rend="italic">Mangean &#x2019;Ouse</hi> will pay you,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Smith, Payne &#x26; Smith&#x2019;s, 1 Lombard St., nr. Mansion House, the lord mayor&#x2019;s residence.</note> or John or anybody you send, the sum noted, to keep the house warm for a time. That is the most essential message of the present postday.</p>
<p>Directly after sending off my last Letter, I got your two,&#x2014;thanks for them; thanks for your own good kind little sheet especially:&#x2014;next day (Saturday) Jamie yoked his old Gig, and drove me rapidly off in a high wind hither, taking Gill by the road. Mary, poor thing, looks very old for her years; has a sad kind of composed aspect: all busy as bees round her, and a good crop this year,&#x2014;encircled with floods of Irish Navvies and Railway confusion; little else in the shape of novelty since I was last there. An hour and half more of tempest brought us to Dumfries; where, dismissing Jamie home, I have continued in a Purgatory of <hi rend="italic">noise</hi> (tho&#x2019; with features of a Paradise in it too, for real kindness belongs to the latter region of things), and have been terribly tattered about ever since. Tomorrow (unless it prove rainy) I mean to be off by some Lockerby Omnibus, and thence by rail to Ecclefechan and Scotsbrig, where at least I shall be <hi rend="italic">quieter</hi>; the old windy moors will not fret me with <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> of any kind, at least of any kind that requires to be <hi rend="italic">answered</hi>. My heart is utterly sad, and lonely; it is a most lonely business this earthly life of mine for me! But I must not take to whining; that will never do.</p>
<p>The Chelsea Letters you sent me were of small moment mostly; one of them from a Printer&#x2019;s Young Men&#x2019;s Society (or whatever they called it) wishing me (modest youths!) to give them a Copy of my Books: the other two were from Wiley &#x26; Putnam,&#x2014;contained a Bill for &#xa3;73.4.9; the magnificent sum that my American Cromwell has realised up to <date when="1847-07-00">July</date> last! Besides the Bill there was a Letter elaborately endeavouring to explain how this exiguous modicum was, after all, the right sum, instead of (I suppose) ten times as much, which probably might have been thought nearer it! I must <pb id="pg-22-80" n="22:80"/>write to W. and P. today, indicating that I have got the Bill; and, in polite language, that they are &#x201C;d&#x2014;&#x2014;d swingla&#x2019;s&#x201C; for sending no more. I must pocket it as something gained from the mouths of wild ravens:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See 1 Kings 17:4&#x2013;6.</note> Clarke, my Yankee <hi rend="italic"><foreign>Getreuer</foreign></hi> [trusted follower]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >E. P. Clark, Boston bank cashier, who handled TC&#x2019;s accounts with American publishers; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431117-TC-RWE-01"><sic>17:180</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1843-11-17">17 Nov. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> appears to be making <hi rend="italic">pause</hi> on such an issue; but he too, what <hi rend="italic">can</hi> he make of it more?&#x2014; &#x2014; O Dearest, be as good to me as thou canst! I must end here abruptly; being warned that &#x201C;dinner&#x201C; is come. On Wednesday, if all prosper, I will write again.&#x2014; There was a vague word from John too,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1847-09-14">14 Sept.</date></note> along with your last Note; tell him so, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> the &#x201C;vague.&#x201C; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Jamie,&#x2014;</salute>I think you would not get this till 2 o&#x2019;clock tomorrow afternoon at soonest: I have some thoughts of coming off by the Lockerby Coach at 11 o&#x2019;clock that same day (tomorrow, Tuesday); and in that case, so far as I can at present compute, you will see me in person, very shortly after reading this Note! If I do not come, then you may infer that, from weather or some other reason, I have put off my journey till Wednesday; and on <hi rend="italic">that</hi> day, at the Ecclefechan Station (between 1 and 2 o&#x2019;clock I think,&#x2014;but you can see distinctly, in the little Northern Miscellany that lies in my room at Scotsbrig), I shall hope to be landing, with my bag, and stock of flannel goods.&#x2014; The train and Coach are so convenient, it seems not worth while to give you such a long drive again.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As the next letter also shows, TC took the coach from Dumfries to Lockerbie, and then traveled back down the valley to Ecclefechan.</note></p>
<p>Tell my Mother I am well, and all are well here. Yesterday and this morning were very wet; now it is brisk and dry again.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Goody,&#x2014;</salute>Take a stupid word from me, rather than none. I have had my dinner; no Letters have come, not even the Dublin <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> (did it never get to Chelsea; or how?);&#x2014;the day is dim <hi rend="italic">Scotch mist</hi>, occasionally thickening into rain; and I have not yet been out at all: reasons enough for your excuse if I be dull. I promised yesterday, and shall perhaps frighten your poor little screamikin of a heart if I do not perform. The paper too (you perceive) is damp; grown damp in my absence: but never mind!</p>
<p>I got to Lockerby yesterday, on a Coa<supplied>[c]</supplied>h<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note>-roof, according to program; a drive I recollected doing last time but one with you, many years ago: the <hi rend="italic"><foreign>braes</foreign></hi> where poor Harry<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s pony at Craigenputtoch; for the drive in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321017-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:250</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-10-17">17 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> had to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi>, and all the phenomena of that old damp afternoon, came, as is the wont in such cases, strangely before me again! At Lockerby, in the midst of Navvy and Mason lumber, and every kind of confusion coerced only by a few &#x201C;Caledonian&#x201C;&#x2014;Lockerby Porters and Officials, I had to wait three quarters of an hour: then the softest of railways for fifteen minutes, and another half-built station-house, and two &#x201C;Caledonian&#x201C;-<hi rend="italic">Ecclefechans</hi> (very strange the old Annandale faces look in their railway fustians and furbishings);&#x2014;after which a walk of an hour; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> I was at Scotsbrig, and that is the last of me up to date. Judge if the quiet room, and the fresh country sleep were welcome to me. In fact I am up to nothing but sleep, I think, at this stage of my history.</p>
<p>Here, that is over Dumfriesshire, I think the chief mood, during these days, is emotion of pity and pretended-pity over the failure of &#x201C;Ried, Irving and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>,&#x201C; the enormous London Merchants.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The international investment firm of Reid, Irving, and Co., among several other companies, suspended operations, <date when="1847-09-17">17 Sept.</date>, with estimated liabilities of &#xa3;1,500,000. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1847-09-18">18 Sept.</date>, attributed the failure to overextended investments in Mauritius and the W Indies.</note> Many people here depended more or less on them. &#x201C;Get money, Jock; honestly if thou can; but get it!&#x201C;&#x2014;and so it terminates, one day&#x2014; By the bye, did <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (&#x201C;honestly&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was, at any rate) get the Bank Letter of Monday, for &#xa3;75? A small peculium to go into the House-purse of a judicious Goody, and keep the Devil out for a time. Mention it when you write;&#x2014;which is to be tomorrow? Besides the Letter from Lady Ashburton,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne Louise Baring, b. Bingham (d. <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), m. to Alexander Baring (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1380"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 1st Baron Ashburton; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430120-TC-MAC-01"><sic>16:27</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1843-01-20">20 Jan. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> which is here, there had <pb id="pg-22-82" n="22:82"/>come none but one from Fitzgerald, about the old story of the &#x201C;uses of the Church&#x201C; and so forth; which is in no case worth the stamp for its weight.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote, <date when="1847-09-20">20 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;I was very glad of your letter: especially as regards that part &#x2026; about the Derbyshire villages. In many other parts of England &#x2026; you would find the same substantial goodness among the people &#x2026; . I also hope you will have some mercy now, and in future, on the &#x2018;Hebrew rags&#x2019; which are grown offensive to you; considering that it was these rags that really did bind together those virtues which have transmitted down to us all the good you noticed in Derbyshire. If the old creed was so commendably effective in the Generals and Counsellors of two hundred Years ago, I think we may be well content to let it work still among the ploughmen and weavers of to-day; and even to suffer some absurdities in the Form, if the Spirit does well upon the whole. Even poor Exeter Hall ought, I think, to be borne with&#x201C; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:580).</note> I wrote to Lady Ashb<hi rend="italic">n</hi> this morning&#x2014;&#x201C;my chances of going to the Grange at present very small.&#x201C; Perhaps you will hear from her yourself by and by.

Two <hi rend="italic">waistcoats</hi> of these Colours; and no <hi rend="italic">buttons</hi> could be got for them at Dumfries: get us a dozen of each sort, at <hi rend="italic">thy</hi> peril,&#x2014;and send them swiftly, for Garthwaite comes on Friday. Not too big, nor too little, nor of a wrong colour, nor of&#x2014;&#x2014;! <closer><salute>&#x201C;Hold your peace, you fool!&#x201C; Enough, therefore</salute></closer></p>

<dateline>Wednesday [<date when="1847-09-22">22 September 1847</date>]</dateline>
<p><salute>First, Dear, to ease your mind as to the bill&#x2014;</salute>it came safe last night&#x2014;and the letter&#x2014;which was more wanted&#x2014; Then here are two notes for you by today&#x2019;s post&#x2014; And then&#x2014;what am I to say next? I have sat ten minutes with pen in hand, wondering if it would be possible to fill up a letter for you, without telling <hi rend="italic">the only thing to be told</hi>&#x2014; But even <hi rend="italic">my</hi> pen-a liner-Genius is not for the moment equal to the greatness of the occasion&#x2014;I am <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> nothing today but stating the plain fact in the plainest terms&#x2014;and besides there is nothing in it now to make you uneasy&#x2014; You are to know then that ever since I wrote the last letter to you I have had no <hi rend="italic">history</hi> &#x201C;to speak of&#x201C;&#x2014;having been confined pretty constantly to bed&#x2014; When I wrote the last letter I was already ill&#x2014;in fact I had never felt <hi rend="italic">well</hi> from the first day of my return&#x2014;but at that writing I perceived I was in for some sort of regular illness&#x2014;I thought at first it was going to be a violent cold&#x2014;but it has not turned to a cold&#x2014; I suppose a D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> would call it some sort of bilious or <pb id="pg-22-83" n="22:83"/>nervous fever&#x2014; Whatever it has been I have suffered horribly from irritation nausea and languor&#x2014; &#x2014;but now I am in the way of getting well again&#x2014; I am out of bed today and able to write to you as you see&#x2014; John has been very kind to me since he knew of my illness, which was not till Sunday afternoon&#x2014; He has come to see me <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> a day&#x2014;and one time staid <hi rend="italic">four hours</hi> in my bedroom reading to me &#x26;c&#x2014; I prohibited him from telling you of it&#x2014;as I did not want you to be kept anxious&#x2014;but now I am so much better that there is not the slightest occasion for anxiety&#x2014;and as to your being <hi rend="italic">there</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, I assure it has been the greatest possible Comfort to me that it so happened&#x2014; I can be twice as patient and composed I find when there is nobody put about by my being laid up&#x2014; Had you been here I should have struggled on longer without taking to bed and been in the desperatest haste to get out of it&#x2014; All the nursing possible has been given me by Anne and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Piper&#x2014;and the perfect quiet of the house could not have been had on other terms&#x2014;nor could Anne have had time to attend to me as I required if we had not had the house all to ourselves&#x2014; So do not be vexed and do not be uneasy&#x2014; I have no ailment now but weakness and so soon as I can get into the air <hi rend="italic">that</hi> will wear off</p>
<p>The only other news of importance is that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baring called here yesterday&#x2014;with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fleming both on horseback<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Fleming (d. <date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>), asst. sec. of the poor law board, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>, socialite, and intimate of the Baring circle, nicknamed &#x201C;The Flea&#x201C; and &#x201C;Jenkin&#x2019;s Hen&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440715-TC-JWC-01"><sic>18:134</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1844-07-15">15 July 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>They left cards and regrets that I was not visible &#x26;c</p>
<p>And now I must stop for this time<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A note from John Carlyle follows, saying: &#x201C;I find Jane a great deal better to-day &#x26; out of bed. I think the attack must have been connected with biliary derangement of some sort; and its causes have been removed.&#x201C;.</note>&#x2014;</p>

Today, in the middle of roaring wind and grey muddy mist, with showers, I went out desperate for a walk: returning, after a long circuit, by the cottage at Middlebie where our Postman calls, I found your new Letter with the news of illness, and <hi rend="italic">my own Letter</hi> of yesterday, all daubed with dirt, still lying. If, on any future day, you find <pb id="pg-22-84" n="22:84"/>my promises unfulfilled, think that perhaps the Cottage people and the Postman are alone the cause.</p>
<p>Surely it has for this time turned out well that I never heard of thy sickness: but do not try that method again! It leaves one uncertain at <hi rend="italic">all</hi> times: there is nothing like telling one the matter as it is; one then knows the worst, and the imagination at least is kept silent.&#x2014; I am truly grateful to John for his good conduct this time; tell him so: and be careful now of cold and other mistreatment; and let me hear (if possible, tomorrow!) that all is going well, and the affair fairly over. Ah me!&#x2014; Poor Campbell too, it seems, is dead. One feels <hi rend="italic">oneself</hi> as if half <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>. Let us do a little <hi rend="italic">work</hi> first, if we only can, and then; but also not till then, if it please the Heavens!</p>
<p>Profound idleness being the rule of my existence here, I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> of course have no history. I walked last twilight and night for two hours, &#x201C;backwards and forwards,&#x201C; under the shelter of a hedge in one of Jamies fields, the Brownmoor Hill, the Solway, some ghost of Cumberland, and the driving clouds and moaning winds my only company. Not very <hi rend="italic">impressive</hi> either; for my heart is shrunk into its cell, and refuses to be impressed: I said silently to the muddy Universe, however, &#x201C;Yes, thou art true, then; the fact is no better than <hi rend="italic">so</hi>; let me recognise the fact, and admit it and adopt it.&#x201C; A poor little Foal came up to me; full of reverence for such a sublime genius; but we could hold very little intercourse together. Reasonably wearied I came home, and had <hi rend="italic">porridge</hi> with sour milk and sweet.</p>
<p>At Dumfries I found Aird suffering from internal biliary distemper; very heavy, dull, and perceptibly <hi rend="italic">fatter</hi> than last time. Poor Aird, a much hebetated, irresuscitable man. Macdiarmid sat doing his &#x201C;leading-article&#x201C; (bless the mark), as brisk as a bee; took me down to his Wife, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have me dine and meet Col<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Burns:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M&#x2019;Diarmid <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17418"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), ed. and owner of the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210110-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:307</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-01-10">10 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>), and his wife Anne, b.

I declare I cannot solve such a mystery: perhaps Anne, or John? And the painting too, I suppose, is all thrown aback?

<p>You must have another little letter today Dear; in case you take a notion to <hi rend="italic">fret</hi>. I continue to mend rapidly. had a good deal of sleep last night&#x2014;without henbane&#x2014;and today, I astonished Anne by telling her I was &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">very</hi> hungry&#x201C;&#x2014; I have absolutely nothing to complain of but weakness&#x2014;and that will not hold out long against such a good appetite</p>
<p>After I had sent off my letter yesterday Lady Harriet called&#x2014; She would not of course venture into a sick room; but she sent up a very kind message, that she would be at Addiscombe till Wednesday, and if I would come there &#x201C;out of this paint&#x201C; she would send the a carriage for me anyday&#x2014;&#x201C;This Paint&#x201C; is not very bad&#x2014;it is only the <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> that is getting done&#x2014;and in my bed room the smell does not reach me at all&#x2014;but in the rooms Anne says it really is very unpleasant&#x2014;I accepted her offer at once&#x2014;as I always do every kindness she offers me&#x2014; That is to say I sent word that I expected to be quite strong enough for going on Saturday in which case I should be most happy to go if she would be so kind as send for me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a note appended to the full text of this letter Alexander Carlyle makes much of Froude&#x2019;s omission of the first part and of Froude&#x2019;s comments in connection with this visit on TC&#x2019;s insistence on &#x201C;the continuance of an intimacy [with Lady Harriet] which could never become an affectionate one, instead of accepting and adopting the facts, as a condition of the mud in the universe&#x201C; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:414).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Redwood,</salute>
<p>Alas, I could like well to get any such quiet and friendly place as Boverton, and your House; to stay there for weeks, or years,&#x2014;or for life, as it seems to me! But I have been wandering almost ever since you saw me; have got now to my ultimate <foreign><hi rend="italic">Non plus ultr&#xE0;</hi>, am dormant</foreign> namely in my good old Mother&#x2019;s House, for a few days, once more; and nothing more, in the travelling way, except one swift plunge, home to Chelsea again, must I think of for a long time to come!</p>
<p>My Wife went with me into Derbyshire, to the watering-places, to the spar-caves; still better, to the open wilds, and beautiful old sleepy villages: a Yorkshire Friend then brought us across the Hills, thro&#x2019; the flames of Sheffield, to his home in Airedale; there we sat, three sunny weeks, looking from our Hilltop over other bright Hills, with their strange Mill-chimnies in the distance,&#x2014;smoky outposts of the great smoke-reservoirs of Leeds and Bradford, which were also visible in the distance. We were very quiet there; and did well. At length the time came: my Wife, who can never yet be persuaded into Scotland since her irreparable losses there, turned southward and homeward, at Leeds; I hitherward, across the Manchester region. And here accordingly I am, for about a fortnight past; very sleepy, very silent; sunk, as is my wont here, in a whole sea of things for which there is no word convenient. Revisiting the ancient solitudes; looking close again into the primal Fountains of one&#x2019;s Life-stream which has now wandered far: this is not a scene to babble in, to be very joyful in! I keep people off from me; and lead a very lonely, somewhat abstruse and mournful, but not perhaps unprofitable existence here. My Mother grows yearly weaker: you know what a world of dark meditations lies for one in that inevitable irremediable fact! These many many years, indeed ever <pb id="pg-22-87" n="22:87"/>since intelligence began with me, the frightfullest thought has been that of losing my Mother: this too, I conjecture, is your own experience, and you know well what this means and will mean! We are to meet such things not with weakness; no, but with whatsoever strength we have. But to call Life &#x201C;a joy,&#x201C; Life having by law of fate such facts as these for its basis everywhere, seems but a feeble piece of logic. Life is not a joy; life is a deadly battle rather:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi> 10:210.</note> let us try to fight it honestly, then.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Redwood: I wish your friendly Boverton were but nearer me; I should often fly thither for a few still days. Good be with you there, whether I am there or not. Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>You can&#x2019;t be said Dear, to have wasted many letters on me in this absence!</salute> But if you &#x201C;feel <hi rend="italic">a stop</hi>&#x201C; (quakerly speaking) best to let it have way; no good comes of <hi rend="italic">forcing Nature</hi>, in the matter of writing or any other matter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I go on mending. I had more sleep last night, and feel strong enough today to meditate a short turn in the open air. When John comes I shall propose it to him. I am not to go to Addiscombe tomorrow&#x2014; Last night, at <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> oclock, I was just going to bed&#x2014;very tired&#x2014;John and Mazzini having sat <hi rend="italic">talking Dante</hi> beside me, till I had to be <hi rend="italic">struck with a sudden thought</hi> that M. would miss the Hoxton<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In NE London.</note> Omnibus unless John saw him off instantly. When Anne came to announce the importune fact of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fleming! &#x201C;Well I said send him away, I cannot receive him at this time of night.&#x201C; But he would not be sent away &#x201C;he had come <hi rend="italic">charged</hi> with a message from Lady Harriet (!) and if I would just see him for five minutes&#x201C;&#x2014; The other time he called was with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baring&#x2014;changed times for little M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Harris!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;He used to come very assiduously hither, poor little soul, but was now rising in the world&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).

<p>Never mind.

<p><salute>Thanks, dear little Jeannie, many thanks to thee:</salute> I hardly expected any Note this afternoon, knowing the misfortune that had happened to my own, which I hope you are <hi rend="italic">now</hi> at last about getting to read. Thank Heaven also, that there was such good news to send!&#x2014; I meant to write a word for your cup of tea on Saturday night, that you might take to your <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> with better heart: I know not now when you will get this or with absolute certainty where: but I send it off to Addiscombe; there the poor zero will be welcome when it comes.</p>
<p>We have bright weather here today; Jamie busy carrying in the last of his Corn. My Mother is not well; I took her a little walk over the fields, which has made her a degree livelier: poor Mother, she is very frail, and in two or three kinds of health sometimes in a day.

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>Marshall told me at Leeds, some time ago, that you had been somewhat seriously unwell, but that now you had got quite round again. Fitzgerald, to whom I was communicating the latter part of the news, writes to me as if the recovery were by no means perfect, but only a &#x201C;getting over the worst.&#x201C; Pray send me a word straightway on that subject; on whatever other or others you like, but on that at any rate, and without delay.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote, <date when="1847-09-20">20 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Thank you for your account of Spedding: I had written however to himself, and from himself ascertained that he was out of the worst. But Spedding&#x2019;s life is a very ticklish one&#x201C; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:581). Spedding replied to TC, <date when="1847-09-26">26 Sept.</date>, that he had had dysentery, &#x201C;which &#x2026; left me in very reduced circumstances. But by assiduous importation of beef steaks and brandy I recovered what I lost of the body very rapidly &#x2026; . Whether I can keep pace with you in smoke I am not sure,&#x2014;not having tried tobacco since my illness.&#x201C;.</note></p>
<p>I wander daily in sight of your Mountains; have been here about a fortnight now, reposing from confused rambles over Derbyshire and Yorkshire. Few things could be pleasanter to me, nothing of the kind so pleasant, as to see your Brother<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Story Spedding (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380217-TC-TSS-01"><sic>10:32</sic><corr>TC to TSS, <date when="1838-02-17">17 Feb. 1838</date></corr></ref>), who lived at Greta Bank, nr.

I am utterly weary, unequal to any enterprise of Hill travelling,&#x2014;I may say, any enterprise requiring Hope in <hi rend="italic">moderate</hi> doses. I have tried you by all the combinations in the Carlisle railway table; but none of them will bring me from Ecclefechan <pb id="pg-22-91" n="22:91"/>even to Cockermouth: and for a whole day of coaching, among vulgar human bipeds, with the old shadows of the mountains, and shadows of the universe, falling on me, sad and earnest out of old years,&#x2014;alas, as Homer sings, &#x201C;he shudders at it in his soul,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> 16:199.</note> horrible is the thought to him!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440912-TC-JWC-01"><sic>18:201</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1844-09-12">12 Sept. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> I must sit here, and smoke tobacco, in an abstruse humour, for a week more, for uncertain days more; and then be shot home again to Chelsea, by express trains,&#x2014;by gunpowder, and cannon of long range, if that were possible!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spedding&#x2019;s reply suggested routes via Carlisle, Cockermouth, and Keswick, or Carlisle and Wigton: &#x201C;How the enterprise should be impossible to a man who carries wherewithal to sit on his outside,&#x2014;and an &#x2018;Invincible&#x2019; with a capital I, in his inside, I cannot clearly understand.

<p>Pray write, and soon. Old friends grow more precious to me as I myself grow old; indisposed to new alliances, not to say incapable of such.</p>
<p>Ireland, England, indeed the whole world, is growing more and more a bewildering horror to me: I believe, if I live long, I shall have to write another Book, and a more frightful one than any of the rest.

The fact of its existence was revealed to me in this accidental manner&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Piper said one day she would have done so &#x26; so only that when she wrote to ask me about it I had sent no answer&#x2014;I replied that no letter from her had ever reached me&#x2014;that was strange, she said, for her Husband sealed her letter into <hi rend="italic">the shilling one</hi> that was forwarded to the post office at Buxton&#x2014; I said to the best of my recollection you got <hi rend="italic">no</hi> letter at Buxton&#x2014;and certainly could not have got <hi rend="italic">that</hi> one or <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would have got the enclosure&#x2014; When she told her Husband he affirmed that a shilling-letter&#x2014;American he thought&#x2014;had been forwarded to Buxton in time to reach you there on the sunday morning&#x2014;and after much writing and signing of papers the enclosed has been looked up&#x2014;</p>
<p>As for the <hi rend="italic">buttons</hi> I expect to realize them for this post.&#x2014;by going myself to the shop in the Kings road <hi rend="italic">in an Omnibus</hi>&#x2014; Already yesterday I went a little way in an Omnibus, and was not the worse for it&#x2014;nor the better either I think.</p>
<p>I was just thinking last night how I could word an excuse to Lady Harriet when there came a kind note from her<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1847-09-24">24 Sept.</date>, in which she said: &#x201C;Monday can you come to Stanhope St. to come down with me &#x26; I will send you safe home on Friday if you will stay with me for so long.&#x201C;.</note> which again <hi rend="italic">tuned me up</hi> to the going-pitch. So I wrote instead that I would join her at Stanhope street on Monday I wish the coachman <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have permitted the carriage to come this way&#x2014;which I dare say is not two <hi rend="italic">yards</hi> about!</p>
<p>The painting <hi rend="italic">undertaken for</hi> will be finished on Monday I fancy&#x2014;and the rest must await a more convenient season. I can stand no more of it at present&#x2014; Oh such mad work Chambers is making of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> front it will hardly be possible to live beside it</p>

<p><salute>I meant to have written a line yesterday on my arrival.</salute> but the thing was really not <hi rend="italic">practicable</hi>; with all the wish in the world. The worry of getting off had been considerable&#x2014;I was to be at Stanhope Street at 12&#x2014;which necessitated my getting up earlier than I had done for ten days&#x2014;then when M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Piper went to the Hospital for a cab, there was none there, and she had to go on to the Admiral Keppel,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Chelsea Hospital (see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470325-TC-JCA-01"><sic>21:189</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1847-03-25">25 March 1847</date></corr></ref>). The public house Admiral Keppel, in the Fulham Rd., Chelsea.</note> I fidgetting excessively to see that I should be too late for my appointment and not knowing the meaning of it. I was still in great good time however, for we did not start from Stanhope <pb id="pg-22-96" n="22:96"/>Street till near one&#x2014; It was the open carriage and very cold&#x2014;and my head took to aching dreadfully&#x2014;I knew however, in settling to come here, that I must lay my account with a rather <hi rend="italic">Spartan</hi> treatment in <hi rend="italic">little</hi> things&#x2014;so I crept away to bed without saying a word, and the dinner not being till <hi rend="italic">six</hi> now, my headach had done itself out before then&#x2014;and I was able to tidy myself and come down as if nothing had happened.&#x2014; I slept ill enough&#x2014;nevertheless I was up to breakfast&#x2014;and feel rather stronger today&#x2014;and I hope to hold on till Friday without giving any signs of illness, and getting good of being obliged to exert myself&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had sent away the Sunday newspapers before your note countermanding Douglas Jerrold came&#x2014; John forgot them on Sunday night&#x2014;and I was afraid of Anne forgetting them if left to her to send&#x2014; I hope you got the buttons and that they suit&#x2014;</p>
<p>Lady Harriet is looking extremely well and in firstrate spirits&#x2014; She laughs at your complaints of her silence&#x2014;and says she has been &#x201C;so busy reading Clarendon on the journey&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Hyde, 1st earl of Clarendon, <hi rend="italic">History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England</hi> (Oxford, <date when="1702-00-00">1702</date>&#x2013;<date when="1804-00-00">4</date>, from transcript; Oxford, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>, from original MS).</note> and another time she said I could tell you it was because you took part with Lady Ashburton in calling her letters like a stick&#x2014; The fact is I suppose Lady Harriet writes letters as I and other women do, chiefly to bring letters in return, and if she <hi rend="italic">get</hi> plenty of letters all the same whether she answer them or not <foreign><hi rend="italic">tanto meglio per lei</hi></foreign> [so much the better for her]! She sends you a p[a]ragraph<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> which she cut out of the Times for your express benifit<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;FAME in AUTHORSHIP.&#x2014;Confidential Assistance.&#x2014; A practised reviewer and classical scholar, whose acknowledged productions in various departments of literature have elicited from &#x2018;The Athenaeum,&#x2019; &#x2018;The Times,&#x2019; quarterlies, and other periodicals, testimonials which will furnish incontestable evidence of his competence, engages to enhance or create the fame of diffident aspirants in any branch of the belles lettres.

<p>Lady H knew the Duchess des Praslin&#x2014;she says she was &#x201C;dreadful fat and a disagreeable sort of woman.&#x201C;&#x2014; She says also that there can be no doubt that the Duke intended to shoot the Porter to make him bear the blame&#x2014;but there is a part of the story not made public which is a thousand thousand times worse than all the rest&#x2014;and makes the man such a monster as even Dumas and Sue<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexandre Dumas (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>) and Eug&#xE8;ne Sue (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>), French sensational novelists.</note> could not have imagined the like of&#x2014; Something that took place immediately before the murder&#x2014;either because on going <pb id="pg-22-97" n="22:97"/>into her room he had found her awake&#x2014;and needed to make some pretence for coming there&#x2014;or&#x2014;that the <hi rend="italic">examination</hi> afterwards might prove the good terms he was living on with her&#x2014; And he had come from his Country house <hi rend="italic">the week</hi> before to take out all the screw-nails of the doors and bells in her room!</p>
<p>When Luzzi was told that some fragments of her letters had been found&#x2014;she exclaimed, &#x201C;<foreign>L&#x2019;Imbecile et il m&#x2019;avait promis a detruire <hi rend="italic">tout</hi></foreign> [The imbecile and he had promised me to destroy everything]!</p>
<p>I had a very kind letter from Lady Ashburton yesterday, offering me any quantity of apples and pears and announcing some game&#x2014;most useless all&#x2014;if she would have sent me a little honey instead&#x2014;</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baring is at his Yeomanry&#x2014;so we are quite alone&#x2014;</p>
<p>My head is taken to ach again since I began to write&#x2014;there was a note to be written to John too who wished to hear how I stood the journey<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle replied, [<date when="1847-09-29">29 Sept.</date>], with news of the house painting at 5 Cheyne Row, letters received there, and a satisfactory conclusion to the &#x201C;miserable business&#x201C; of Dr. Campbell of Honiton.</note> So I must break of&#x2014;I wonder if I shall ever have a clear enough head again to write a letter worth anything anybody&#x2019;s reading</p>

<p><salute>Alas, my poor little Dear!</salute> I fear you have made but a poor job of it, after all: Sleeplessness and &#x201C;Spartan treatment&#x201C; are not much to realize by going from home! I wish I heard of you in your own snug bed again; sleeping there, sound, and waited on by those that know how to take care of you. I did not know for certain, till I met the Post this afternoon on the Middlebie Road, that you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> actually gone; there were so many variations in the scheme: I hope this Letter will find you on <hi rend="italic">Thursday Evening</hi>; tho&#x2019; of that I have no direct evidence either; your Letter had evidently been written <hi rend="italic">before</hi> mine came yesterday&#x2014;on Friday morning, <hi rend="italic">before</hi> setting off for home, you will at any rate get it; may it be worth something to you when it does come.</p>
<p>I could have written yesterday, but that an obstinate unspeakable feeling of <hi rend="italic">stupidity</hi> and stagnancy, and what they call &#x201C;bad spirits,&#x201C; which means laziness mixed with weakness of mind, had overtaken me; and I lay <pb id="pg-22-98" n="22:98"/>all day among the bushes by the side of the Burn; and listening to the <hi rend="italic">Devil&#x2019;s Cauldron</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A pool at the foot of a waterfall at Scotsbrig.</note> which seemed to speak the only dialect fit for me at the moment. My sight of Grange, my ride, and wretched <hi rend="italic">cold-ambitious</hi> dinner, and the whole ghastly phantasm of the Past Time, acted very unkindly on me. I was absolutely <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> by all the boring and botheration, poor weak wretch that I am!

It is positively very wicked and base to write all this, even to thee; and I charge thee speak of it to no mortal whatsoever.&#x2014; &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle,&#x201C; the same who once escorted you to Liverpool in the Steamer (do you remember, as he well does?)&#x2014;a really goodhumoured modest healthy young fellow, he accompanied me to Waterbeck on the way home (and helped to get me away too, pleading pressure of time himself);<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s cousin Thomas Carlyle, always styled &#x201C;of Waterbeck,&#x201C; appears to have had a son Thomas, though the occasion when he escorted JWC is not traced.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter from Alick, enclosing one addressed specially to yourself by little Tom: it came yesterday, and we send it off to you, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yet including Jean at Dumfries among the readers of it, who is said to be somewhat <hi rend="italic">dilatory</hi> occasionally in doing her part in such cases; you can forward it to her at your leisure. Mother and I came whirling over hither thro&#x2019; the brisk autumn wind; I write this little Note, and will try to get the whole stuck into the Post-Office at Ecclefechan as we return.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-22-102" n="22:102"/>Nothing new has occurred here since I suppose you have heard almost daily thro&#x2019; Jane what nothings I reported. Our Mother is really tolerably well; complaining of <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> today as we came along, tho&#x2019; the wind is high and really cold for the season: she occasionally takes frail fits, but not often, and has had none of a bad sort since my arrival in these parts.&#x2014; Poor Mary here is complaining a little; we had heard the other day that she was &#x201C;rather ill,&#x201C; worth reporting as &#x201C;ill,&#x201C; and even in bed for one day; but today we find her astir again, and not worse than when I was last here,&#x2014;which indeed is no great height of health; for she looks worn, weary, and decidedly in a feeble kind of state. So far as my non-medical character can entitle me to inquire, I find she has a constant complaint of laxity in the bowels, these many weeks past; in fact all the symptoms she used to correspond with you upon,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">excepting</hi>, which I suppose is an important exception, that there is nothing &#x201C;ulcerous&#x201C; without or within, only tendencies that way. I conjecture that some medicine, especially some directions as to diet, might do her good: pray send such, immediately if you can.&#x2014; The rest are very well here; have a superior crop, potatoes and all, and seem doing well. Jamie knows nothing of the <hi rend="italic">address</hi> alluded to in Alick&#x2019;s Letter; but Peter of Carstammon probably does;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Austin, brother of TC&#x2019;s brother-in-law James; living nr. Craigenputtoch.</note> to whom application shall be made.</p>
<p>You have had a rather bad bout, poor Jane and you, I find! Today she is come back into your neighbourhood, as I like to fancy, and I hope will get herself taken care of again. At Addiscombe, I seemed to trace in her Letter, she had been somewhat thrown off the rails in that respect. She speaks with warm gratitude of your attention to her, and felicitous treatment of her; for which, as I need not state, I also feel deeply indebted. This is the first real Doctor-praise you ever got from her: from which am I to infer that you found her <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than you had ever chanced to do before, and so first took a real hold of her? I fear sometimes she has been worse than has yet been intimated to me! I beg you very especially to keep watch over her, and be of all the help to her you can, till my return; which I think now will not be delayed much.</p>
<p>In Annandale your fame as a Doctor has a decidedly high footing, as I everywhere get to understand. Poor old Graham says, with enthusiasm, &#x201C;Hi might have the whoal practice of Annandale,&#x201C; and then in a tone rising ever higher, &#x201C;the whoal of it! All!&#x201C; Oh whow!&#x2014; But really this point ought</p>

<p>My visit here has gone off rather successfully in one sense; I never saw Lady Harriet in such spirits, so talkative and disposed to be talked to&#x2014;I should have enjoyed being beside her more than usual, if I had not felt a need of exerting myself much beyond my strength; as she made a point of ignoring the fact that anything ailed me, I fancy it must be one of her notions about me that I am hypecondriacal and to be made well by being treated as tho there were not a doubt of it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Patience! patience! but there never was a more complete mistake&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in LM).</note> Happily I have got thro&#x2019; it without giving any trouble&#x2014;but shall be glad to get home today where I may have a fire in my room when I am shivering, and a glass of wine when I am exhausted, and may go to bed when my head gets the better of me without feeling it to be &#x201C;a secret to <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>please her&#x201C;&#x2014; Every day here I have had to slip into bed about two and lie with a dreadful headach till five when it went suddenly away&#x2014;and when the housemaid not Eliza) <hi rend="italic">she</hi> is in town) found that I lighted my bedroom fire myself, she carried away the coals! and no bell could bring her&#x2014;and the room is so cold and damp now there is no sun. And then no dinner till six&#x2014;and no wine but <hi rend="italic">hock</hi> which makes me ill&#x2014;and John had bad me take <hi rend="italic">two</hi> glasses (no less) of Maidera&#x2014;and in short &#x201C;there is no place like <hi rend="italic">home</hi>&#x201C; for being sick in&#x2014;and I should understand this once for all&#x2014; &#x2014;I am a little stronger however than I came&#x2014;tho I have not had <hi rend="italic">one</hi> good night&#x2014;and I expect to feel the benefit of <hi rend="italic">the change</hi> when I return&#x2014; When I look at my white white face in the glass I wonder how anybody can believe I am <hi rend="italic">fancying</hi></p>

It was referred to as &#x201C;clandestine&#x201C; in a police report submitted to the French premier, <date when="1848-01-00">Jan. 1848</date>, that said they planned to send emissaries to Tuscany, Piedmont, Rome, and Naples to further the movements there (see <hi rend="italic">Scritti</hi> 33:41).</note> I asked if he had meant to put himself at the disposal of the Pope?&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh no&#x201C; he said what he aimed at was &#x201C;to <hi rend="italic">organize</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lead</hi> an expedition into Lombardy which would be <hi rend="italic">better than being an individual under the Pope</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;in which words seemed to me to lie the whole secret of Mazzinis <hi rend="italic">failed life</hi>!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;B&#xF6;lte&#x2019;s translation of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Verfehltes Leben</hi></foreign>&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).

This was to come, but already Mazzini distrusted the pope&#x2019;s intentions and was irritated by enthusiasm for him.

In <date when="1847-09-00">Sept.</date> he had drafted and circulated to friends an &#x201C;Open Letter to the Pope,&#x201C; saying that the pope should initiate a new era by appealing directly to the people and that the unity of Italy would be achieved without him, if not with him.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You had a Letter from me lately out of Yorkshire; and this month I write <pb id="pg-22-107" n="22:107"/>you again, dating from another place, much more interesting to you! I have been here some three weeks; in fact, came direct hither, Jane returning Southward from our Yorkshire quarters to Chelsea: and now just before my own return homeward, here has your Letter to my Mother come, which quickens in me the purpose I had to write you a line before leaving this old native quarter. It was the day before yesterday that your Letter came to hand; our Mother and Jenny both eagerly announced it to me when I came in from my excursions; yesterday we read it to Mary at the Gill, where Mother and I were; and tonight, I suppose, it is in the Doctor&#x2019;s hands at Chelsea, who will soon return it to Dumfries. Tom&#x2019;s Enclosure, which gave great satisfaction here, went of course with it.</p>
<p>Our dear old Mother is very well here; considering her age, fully as well as I could expect to see her. Her hand shakes a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> worse than when you saw her; otherwise there is little perceptible change. She is much delighted to learn of your welfare, to see that you are &#x201C;getting more content in your new place,&#x201C; as she expresses it: and, I think, of all the news you have ever sent there is none that gratifies her more than this of the &#x201C;Secession-Church Minister,&#x201C; whom you are about getting. Good old Mother! She is even now sitting at my back, trying at another table to write you a small word with her own hand; the first time she has tried such a thing for a year past. It is Saturday night, after dark; we are in the East room, in a hard dry evening, with a bright fire to ourselves two; Jenny and her <foreign>Bairns</foreign> are &#x201C;scouring up things&#x201C; in the other end of the house; and below stairs the noisier operations of the farm go on, in a subdued tone: you can conceive the scene!&#x2014; Jamie has got all his crop in, and indeed the Harvest is quite over, a fortnight ago, on all hands of us: 20 ricks Jamie has, a considerably heavier crop than he expected; <hi rend="italic">no potatoes</hi>, however, having planted none; moreover, it seems, <hi rend="italic">within a week past</hi> the disease has broken out in the unlucky potatoes <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, and people are all hastening to get them up: with that exception, there was hardly ever seen a better crop all over Britain, and all over Europe as far as we can hear. Very many of the Grain-dealers of last year have <hi rend="italic">failed</hi>; and grain-prices bid fair, by all symptoms, to be <hi rend="italic">low</hi>. This, so far as it comes from <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi>, is certainly a blessing; but there is likely to be another <hi rend="italic">sadder</hi> cause for low prices: the terribly embarrassed state all manner of trade is in,&#x2014;nothing but failure on the back of failure; a short crop of <hi rend="italic">cotton</hi> in America, and all the Manchester region in great embarrassment. Properly it is the <hi rend="italic">down-tumble</hi> of the railway mania which raged at its height about two years ago: you never saw the like then and since; some 3 or 4 <hi rend="italic">hundred millions</hi>, they say, are laid out in railways all over Britain;&#x2014;which of course has absorbed all the ready capital of the country, and left neither money nor <hi rend="italic">saleable</hi> money&#x2019;s-worth to carry on any &#x201C;trade&#x201C; with! The wretched children of Mammon are right well served: but for the poor people that depend on them, it is a sad <pb id="pg-22-108" n="22:108"/>enough case. You will read in the Newspapers the account of one great failure, very interesting in this quarter, that of the great &#x201C;Irvings,&#x201C; Reid, Irving &#x26; C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>,&#x2014;the Irvings of Burnfoot.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The head of the firm was Sir John Rae Reid, 2d bart.

W of Scotsbrig. His son John succeeded him at Newfield; see Marrs 785.</note> but of course this is a sore downbreak to all of them.&#x2014; &#x2014; In return for all that confusion, we have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> a new railway here, actually running from Beattock to Carlisle, for some weeks past, heard squealing by all of us many times a day, visible from Mother&#x2019;s end window about the Broadlea and partially from Kirtlebrig all the way to near Land.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kirtlebridge is 3 mi. SE of Ecclefechan, Broadlea is 1&#xBD; mi. E, and Land ca. 1&#xBD; mi. ENE. TC then goes on to trace the line, which passes E after Ecclefechan station (N of the village), via Kirkconnell Hall (&#x201C;Ha&#x2019;&#x201C;), owned by Dr. Archibald Arnott, physician (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270419-TC-JWCGW-01"><sic>4:218</sic><corr>TC to JWCGW, <date when="1827-04-19">19 April 1827</date></corr></ref>); Land; and then turns SE to Kirtlebridge.</note> I came on it one day from Lockerby: it passes Milk-Water a little <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the Mail-road; winds, by deep cuttings, but without tunnels, within sight of Cockles-Yeth, across the Cowdens or rather <hi rend="italic">Breconhill</hi> Height, right thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">Bar Moss</hi> (which, they say, has quite <hi rend="italic">disappeared</hi> from the place); then within sight of Colinpint (I supposed it to be), and so sweeps gently round to the <hi rend="italic">Swaugh</hi>, where the Ecclefechan <hi rend="italic">Station</hi> is, and the road crosses the railway <hi rend="italic">on a bridge</hi>. The railway then whirls along direct for &#x201C;Ha&#x2019;,&#x201C; almost touches the corner of poor Dr Arnott&#x2019;s stable there; and rushes along thro&#x2019; the Eastmoor (about a gunshot below the Sawyer&#x2019;s house), goes with a deep cut across Slater&#x2019;s and the Castlebank fields; then, by a huge mound and little bridge, across the Westgill Burn, close by Philip&#x2019;s Cottage; and so across Mein-water, between Land and Burrens, by a big bridge and long mound towards Broadlea, Kirtlebrig &#x26;c &#x26;c. It crosses the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> roads, both at once or nearly so, at the <hi rend="italic">Galls</hi>; where it is said there is to be a station for lime, for coals &#x26;c: and there we will leave it!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sawyer, Slater, and Philip are unidentified; Galls is just N of Kirtlebridge station; a lime works was just S of the station.</note> I know not whether <hi rend="italic">too much</hi> description have not already been given: but perhaps you will like to picture the figure of the thing once for all. With such a <hi rend="italic">winding</hi> course, there is great <hi rend="italic">squealing</hi> needed, and that ugly Steam-whistle must henceforth perpetually break the solitude in Annandale. The thing, I suppose, will turn out to be beneficial at last; but in the meanwhile it seems to me <pb id="pg-22-109" n="22:109"/>likely that the <hi rend="italic">Land</hi> and the owners of the Land are likely to reap the main benefit, and many other&#x2019;s more loss for a good season. Enough of it now! They are driving another railway, &#x201C;the Nithsdale,&#x201C; up past Austin&#x2019;s place even now,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Nithsdale line, in order to join the Glasgow-to-Ayr line with Dumfries and Carlisle, left the Caledonian line at Gretna for Annan, passing James Austin&#x2019;s farm, the Gill, 4&#xBD; mi. NW of Annan.</note> and clouds of blackguard Irishmen are on it: but of that we will say nothing.&#x2014; The weather is bright and dry; drier all this year than usual; the ground at present is <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> as lead, and the <hi rend="italic">grass</hi> quite gone: altogether the look of poor old Annandale, with the fields so bare and bright, is unusual to me.</p>
<p>Dear Brother, I certainly think you will be very wise to get that Frame-barn you speak of: it must be an almost indispensable convenience, if you do not thatch your stacks. Make <hi rend="italic">an effort</hi> for it; and if you cannot manage it, take some of that money to help you. We delight much to hear of improvements made upon poor far-off <hi rend="italic">Bield</hi>: every new improvement you make, it becomes more <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>: by and by, too, there is little doubt, even on the money side, all the care you take of it will pay you well. Steady, steady! It gratifies us all to think of our dear Brother and kindred following a manful course, and modestly prospering in it. We may have little money; but if so we shall not have &#x201C;a million and a half&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than <hi rend="italic">none</hi>, I suppose; which is some comfort!&#x2014; My Mother is very anxious, as the rest of us are too, about the poor little child <hi rend="italic">Jamie</hi>:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1924-00-00">1924</date>), Alexander and Janet&#x2019;s fourth son.</note> do not forget to tell us.&#x2014; The Doctor, when his Book is over, or perhaps sooner, when I am off, will probably come hither. Jenny returns to Dumfries when I go. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother. Ever yours,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>Poor Mary Carlyle (Harkness) died at Ecclefechan, the very night I came here. We did not know of her illness, which had been sudden. They were very poor, the Husband too, was unwell: unhappy creatures! Jamie attended the funeral.</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>There has a sort of demand risen in Chelsea for good <hi rend="italic">Honey-comb</hi>, and a sort of engagement on my part, in consequence, to take some steps for procuring a few pounds of it, if I can. My means, I find, are limited strictly <pb id="pg-22-110" n="22:110"/>to what you, by the aid of Mrs Dick,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320522-TCJWC-JC-01"><sic>6:164</sic><corr>TCJWC to JC, <date when="1832-05-22">22 May 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> can do for me. If Mrs Dick have, or can in a day or two get, a few pounds of good Honey-comb,&#x2014;I suppose one could stow it safely into some kind of procurable tin-case, which if wrapt in paper would render it safe company for clothes in a portmanteau? I wish you would speak to Mrs Dick, first about the existence of said Honeycomb itself, then about the fit case for packing it in; and, provided all be right, get me together a fair household stock of the article,&#x2014;as soon as possible. I do not know at all how many pounds to order;&#x2014;as many as will be sure of keeping, when there are but <hi rend="italic">two</hi> to eat it: I can give no closer rule; except perhaps to add that it has <hi rend="italic">to go in a portmanteau</hi>. Or could it go safe in a sack of oatmeal; or stuck to the end of a butter-firkin? In that case, you might have plenty of <hi rend="italic">time</hi>, still a few weeks, to do your best in making a good choice; and might even realize a <hi rend="italic">Borgue</hi> specimen?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Honey, for which Borgue, a village 6 mi. S of Kirkcudbright, was noted.</note> I am quite ignorant; and having set the case before you, must leave it there; begging only to hear about the article as soon as may be,&#x2014;and to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> it, if it is to go with me, on Wednesday next, Wednesday <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, that is. I am speculating about taking my departure on Thursday; and at any rate there will be no sure chance after that. So do the best you can.</p>
<p>I am still talking about another drive to Dumfries, and back the same day,&#x2014;possibly enough <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi>, but one cannot fix, there are so many uncertainties:&#x2014;however do you write me a line on Tuesday, whether I come or not, I shall then be brought to a state of certainty.</p>
<p>We had a Letter on Thursday from Alick; which is now gone to the Doctor, and will reach you before long: all well, only the youngest child had fallen and hurt itself,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either Margaret (<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1935-00-00">1935</date>) or James, whose exact date of birth is not known.</note>&#x2014;great quantities of Irish Emigrants too were sick and dying of dysentery &#x201C;in temporary sheds&#x201C; about Brantford and all other Towns. Alick supposes, &#x201C;Jean is too busy with her children to write him a Letter.&#x201C; Write, and convince him of the contrary.</p>
<p>Our Mother and I were at Gill yesterday: Mary is in a poorish state, tho&#x2019; on foot again; labouring much under biliary derangements. Mother stood the wind very well; but the old Gig, quite loose in the rearward screws, went waggling like a monstrous <hi rend="italic">rowly-powly</hi> [pudding] dish, and annoyed her, especially in the home-coming, a good deal; today she has been rather feckless, but has brightened up into her usual state at evening again.</p>
<p>Jane, I learned on returning from you, had fallen ill the day before Jamie and I came; and had been rather heavily unwell,&#x2014;a kind of &#x201C;bilious fever&#x201C;; which John had successfully doctored, and brought round the corner again; <pb id="pg-22-111" n="22:111"/>tho&#x2019; the poor patient seems still to be rather feeble, and obliged to nurse herself.</p>
<p>I am very idle here, and <hi rend="italic">sleepy</hi>: I went one day, riding, to Gillenbie; shall perhaps have to go again, if the skies keep brisk, for Stewart was not at home that day; whom, however, I saw for a little while, at Gill, last night. Another day I went to Grange; saw some of the Waterbeck people, being escorted by Graham of Burnswark: a rather dismal ride that! In fact I may be said to be as good as <hi rend="italic">extinct</hi>, till I get home again,&#x2014;if even that fairly awake me.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Good night, dear Jean: if I can, I will make Jamie drive me up on Tuesday: but the old Gig, tho&#x2019; we mended it today, is &#x201C;no great shakes&#x201C;&#x2014;or rather <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a great <hi rend="italic">shakes</hi>,&#x2014;and indeed I have nothing to do but take leave of you, if I were there. Commend me to James;&#x2014;and bid the younger malisons prepare for bed!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest, for your kind little Letter of Yesterday, which I was right glad of;&#x2014;</salute>and here again, just while I was about beginning to write to you, has another Letter come, an hour before its time, still with good news! All&#x2019;s well that ends well: happy, indeed, that you are home again, out of that constrained lodging, very unsuitable in your weak state. My Mother&#x2019;s rage has been considerable, ever since she heard of it, &#x201C;That the puir craitur could na get a bit <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>!&#x201C; Not so much as a bit of fire, &#x201C;for a&#x2019; their grandeur!&#x201C; Money, if it exclude bit things which are apt to go with the <hi rend="italic">want</hi> of it, is of small value,&#x2014;to the possessor or to others.</p>
<p>Did John come to you on Saturday evening? Otherwise you would be without news of me;&#x2014;as indeed what &#x201C;news&#x201C; had he even after my Letter! No &#x201C;news&#x201C;; only the old course of Donothingism, quietly transacted, amid the brisk winds. I rode to Gillenbie that day; a pensive, lonely ride, over the clear solitudes, all silent too, except for one great diapason of howling east-wind; piping loud, with a strong sunshine to accompany it. The humble cottages, and thatched stackyards, and old still scenes, did me good to look upon them: old Earth, especially one&#x2019;s poor old native corner <pb id="pg-22-112" n="22:112"/>of it, is forever beautiful to me. James Stewart, as you know, was not there; only the Wife, a large good woman, good with all her &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">lady</hi>hood,&#x201C; and very much afflicted still, poor woman, for the son they lost last year in China.

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p><hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> is the day fixed for Wigton, unless I hear from you to the <pb id="pg-22-114" n="22:114"/>contrary: I would say Thursday, except that, on a careful survey of the course of posts, I do not find it certain that there would be time for your communicating with me in that case. We will therefore say Friday,&#x2014;at Wigton, if Heaven will, at 50 minutes past 10 a.m. as the official program indicates. I will stay till Monday; then you must speed me on my way to Kendal, and Chelsea,&#x2014;where, if <hi rend="italic">the Silences</hi> I often speak of had any real authority with me, I am due long since!</p>
<p>It did not fully strike me till this morning what an extortionate bargain I have made with you, the distance of Wigton from either of your places so enormous! It is not fair: but you proposed it yourself; so stand by it</p>
<p>I expect your Brother to be with us, if we are not with him, all the time.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas of Greta Bank; James was staying at Mirehouse.</note>&#x2014; And Laurence?

<p><salute>One word, my dear little Jeannie, lest you get uneasy about me, for there was no Letter yesterday either,&#x2014;</salute>and indeed not a moment&#x2019;s time to write one. Neither have I heard anything, yesterday being at any rate the vacant day; but tonight at Scotsbrig I hope there will be something lying for me.</p>
<p>I rode off yesterday, according to appointment, thro&#x2019; the grey silent moors, towards Noon; had a pleasant pensive pilgrimage of it; found Stewart, <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the Stewarts, and over and above a kind of dinnerparty forsooth! We had the Free kirk minister of Lockerby, a heavy-browed, heavy-bodied, brown-eyed, watery-mouthed young man, full of radical ecclesiastical energy, not at all without talent and other worth.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas G. Duncan (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>), minister, <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">50</date>.</note> A gleg [smart] little jennyspinner of a Highlandman, M&#x2019;Callum by name, a kind of road or rail surveyor; a blithe little all-knowing body (by &#x201C;all&#x201C; I mean all in his own district and department): he also made a very tolerable figure.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Otherwise unidentified.</note> A poor dinner, and &#x201C;excellent wines&#x201C; neat as imported, with plenty of <pb id="pg-22-115" n="22:115"/>intelligent talk about matters practical and speculative, and cordial welcome to season all: I spent a quite pleasantish afternoon; and came swiftly thro&#x2019; the dusk and dark on Jamie&#x2019;s Pony; having well ended that small segment of my affairs.&#x2014; Stewart&#x2019;s claret, of which I had four glasses or so, did not suit so well with this day&#x2019;s enterprise, or last night&#x2019;s sleep: there&#x2019;s the rub! However, Jamie and I have come whirling up; and having done our little no-errands, expect to whirl down again, resisting the bitter east wind with success; after which, except for packing, there are to be two days of <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>,&#x2014;rest, ah me!&#x2014;and then, at a very early hour, I am to roll off on my travels southward and homeward!&#x2014; That is the whole narrative; not so important as the Siege of Troy, or so spirit-stirring as the Fight of Sheriffmuir;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Indecisive battle in Perthshire between the govt. forces and Jacobites, <date when="1715-11-13">13 Nov. 1715</date>.</note> but veracious, and the best I have to give. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Quoi</hi></foreign> [What]!&#x201C; as the French say.</p>
<p>One thing is really worth writing: I have hopes of honeycomb! Certain pounds of a thing calling itself &#x201C;virgin honeycomb&#x201C; are actually getting themselves packed in tin at this moment: a &#x201C;bit memorandum,&#x201C; as my poor Mother urges it shall be, of her to Jane. May it prove acceptable when the tin-case is opened, and matters come to proof! Hitherto except the outer surface of the <hi rend="italic">tin</hi> I have seen nothing of it, and expect to see nothing till you shew it me. I hope Shoe-strings,&#x2014;ever-recurring want of shoestrings, those of Matlock Bath have proved rotten!&#x2014;must also be provided; and I have even thoughts of a <hi rend="italic">horse-cloth</hi>, the temperature threatening really to be severe! We shall see, however.</p>
<p>Aird has gone by the window since I began to write; but I scarcely think of going to bother myself with him in such a hurry as I am at present in.&#x2014; This meagre Note, I think, will still go from Dumfries; at all events, we can carry it to Ecclefechan, and leave it in passing.&#x2014; A <hi rend="italic">second</hi> miscrea<supplied>[n]</supplied>t<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> some one about Lockerby as is reported, had laid a tree or &#x201C;obstacle&#x201C; across the new railway the other night; which was again discovered in time, and no harm done.

<p>I <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> to have written yesterday, Dear; but the intention went to paving a <pb id="pg-22-116" n="22:116"/>square inch of the <hi rend="italic">Bad Place</hi>. At my last writing I had rather crowed before I was out of the wood; the pain in my head and face returned when I was in the act of sealing my letter, and this time did not go away at five oclock(!) but continued all day, and all night, to the exclusion of any wink of sleep, and all day again&#x2014; On Sunday night John found me pretty well out of my wits&#x2014; &#x201C;What in the world will you do, do you think&#x201C;? he said looking quite blank. &#x201C;What do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> think I should do&#x201C;? I answered as blankly. &#x201C;Did you ever take any&#x2014;any&#x2014;what-do-they-call-it?&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Any <hi rend="italic">prusic acid</hi>&#x201C;? said I impatiently&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Yes</hi>--<hi rend="italic">yes</hi>(!) that is to say <hi rend="italic">muriatic acid</hi>&#x201C;?&#x2014; &#x201C;No; shall I send for some&#x201C;? &#x201C;But perhaps it will take the skin off the inside of your mouth&#x201C;? &#x201C;Could not I take some <hi rend="italic">Chrysolite</hi> then&#x201C;? &#x201C;Some what?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;That essence of tar thing&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh <hi rend="italic">Kreosote</hi>! yes&#x2014;that might do better&#x201C;&#x2014;and the Kreosote was got forthwith, and applied, and in a quarter of an hour I was well&#x2014;and have had no more of it since. Yesterday it was very fine in the morning&#x2014;the sun shining quite warmly&#x2014;so I thought I would <hi rend="italic">indulge</hi> in a <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> to the top of Sloan Street and back again, and write after&#x2014; But I was tired when I came in and lay down on the sofa to rest, and meanwhile Mazzini came&#x2014;to take leave&#x2014;he goes to Paris on Thursday and then for two or three days &#x201C;into the valley of Madame Sand.&#x201C; He calculates on being absent a month&#x2014; &#x201C;Nothing likely to take place in Italy during that time&#x2014;their prospects less promising every day.&#x201C; When he went away he said looking very kind and sad; &#x201C;will you be stronger when I return and will you be&#x2014;what shall I say&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">good</hi>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">if you can</hi>?&#x201C; There was still time after his departure to have written you a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> note&#x2014;but just when I had got the pen in my hand, Forsters Henry arrived&#x2014;with a note from Forster expressing his &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">interest</hi>&#x2019; in the first half of Geraldines M.S. which he had read for himself and hopes to be able to hear the rest on Wednesday or Friday night, and endless apologies for not being able to come &#x2018;at once&#x2019;&#x2014;and endless thanks for &#x201C;the divine leveret&#x201C; and partridges (Lady Ashburtons &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">game</hi>&#x201C;) which I had desired to be forwarded to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> in my absence&#x2014; All which, sympathy with my Sister-woman required that I should transmit immediately to Geraldine who is doubtless sitting in panting expectation of his verdict&#x2014; And so my pen scribbled off in the direction of Green Heys<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Jewsbury lived.</note> instead of Scotsbrig</p>
<p>A long letter from William Edward followed me to Addiscombe, marked <hi rend="italic">Private</hi>, once outside and twice inside&#x2014;and stopping in the midst besides, to beg that it might be <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> the moment I had finished it&#x2014;as &#x201C;nothing but the Magnet-power of sympathy I possessed could have so beguiled him into laying open the secrets of his heart&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >While W.

Only those who have heard him speak of that gifted woman, know how deep was the impression which she had made upon him. Once, talking of her, he said, &#x2018;She was one of those few women to whom a man could talk all day, or listen all day, with equal pleasure&#x2019;&#x201C; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">Life of Forster</hi> 1:205).</note> The little Quakeress is still <pb id="pg-22-117" n="22:117"/>keeping him &#x201C;in a perfect agony of suspense&#x201C;&#x2014;and not only <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, but another&#x2014;perhaps several others&#x2014; A worldly woman&#x2014;not &#x201C;one of us as a people&#x201C; who acted so, would be called a heartless coquette&#x2014;but a Quakeress it seems may do all this and only be said to &#x201C;feel a stop&#x201C;&#x2014; Let us hope &#x201C;a way may be opened&#x201C; to poor W.

E. sends his &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">reverential love</hi>&#x201C; to you, supposing you now returned</p>
<p>When I told Anne you were likely to be home on Monday; she asked if she should go up and sleep in your bed for a few nights <hi rend="italic">to take the damp</hi> out of it&#x2014; I thanked her for her self-devotion but said we would air it more effectually with good fires&#x2014; The fact is she wished at any risk to be up with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Piper who before <hi rend="italic">my</hi> return slept three nights in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> bed <hi rend="italic">to air it</hi>&#x2014;&#x201C;her husband said it would be such a thing if M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle caught cold just at the beginning of winter&#x201C;!</p>
<p>So many little schemes of improvement about the house have got all choked under the extinguisher of this sickness&#x2014;and even my spare bed is not rehabilitated yet&#x2014; But &#x201C;there&#x2019;s no use rebelling against Providence<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A favorite saying of John Carlyle&#x2019;s; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360730-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:29</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1836-07-30">30 July 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> <closer><salute>Ever yours</salute></closer> <name>J W</name></p>

<p><salute>No news today, my dear; no nothing!</salute> A heavy wet afternoon, successor of a cold, bleak, spitting morning; the rain almost a <hi rend="italic">relief</hi> compared with the iron weather we have had all this while. I have sat all morning &#x201C;busied,&#x201C; so goes the phrase, with the &#x201C;five Newspapers&#x201C; (not a <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> among them) which awaited me last night: one of the unthriftiest of businesses! I may at least write you a little line, for tomorrow evening&#x2019;s tea; that, if you chance to be expecting it, is as eligible as any other probable investment of a small section of my time. As for news&#x2014;the Bull, now getting stall-fed, choked himself on a turnip this morning, and lay painfully recovering on the brow <pb id="pg-22-118" n="22:118"/>of the Linn till lately; that is the most remarkable of the foreign or domestic news we have today. I decided to be idle as a dry bone; and idle to all lengths I am.</p>
<p>Jamie and I came spinning along the dim road last night, thro&#x2019; the moaning winds and moors, at a great rate: at Hoddam Kirk, flaring with two huge lamps thro&#x2019; the hollow Night, there met us the brand-new &#x201C;Accommodation Coach, or Railway Omnibus,&#x201C; started by an Ecclefechan Citizen of the name of Wullie or Johnnie Scott (known to Jack);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Otherwise unidentified. Hoddam Kirk is just over 1 mi. SW of Ecclefechan.</note> performing its first diurnal or nocturnal rounds to Annan. Our pony did not shy; but we ourselves almost did,&#x2014;nothing more astonishing, close by a Churchyard, has fronted me this long time. Shortly after, some rain beginning to spit, it was discovered that we had <hi rend="italic">shed</hi> my poor old silk umbrella; left it lying on the edge of some of the dark hills we had come rattling down: three <hi rend="italic">pipes</hi>, once stowed safely <hi rend="italic">upon</hi> it, were still lying safely in the place; but the poor old umbrella, by superior defect of gravity, had started out, and gone into foreign hands, none knew where! Half-a-crown, I compute, was nearly the value; <hi rend="italic">levity</hi> being the one characteristic and chief value of the poor old article to me. About half past eight we were safe here at Scotsbrig; &#x201C;five Newspapers&#x201C; waiting us; and so, with tea, small talk and tobacco at discretion, was wound up a melancholy grey, cold day,&#x2014;to me such; but perhaps not wholly &#x201C;vacant,&#x201C; for at least I had plenty of dull sad thoughts and dull sad feelings; and the pleasant day does not always prove the profitablest or the most opulent in the end. Let us take, with equanimity, with thankfulness, the days as they come.</p>
<p>One achievement we did accomplish yesterday: the bringing home of the celebrated &#x201C;virgin honey.&#x201C; Here it is, safe so far; a square tin Box, containing 11 pounds (will keep for a year, they say); my poor old Mother&#x2019;s &#x201C;Memorandum&#x201C; to you. The edges at the lid of the Box are done, all safe, with gummed paper; perfectly harmless among <hi rend="italic">clothes</hi> or whatever else: but there is one grave melancholy question, Whether the Portmanteau can spare so much room? For the size (say, a foot every way) is really considerable. We will do our best. Alas, tomorrow is the packing day, and we have many things to do!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x2014;Tea has come upon me, and <hi rend="italic">dark</hi>, at this point. I will finish out my poor scrawl; and then go and have a walk, in spite of the rain.</p>
<p>There was one other thing I had to bid thee resolve upon: When the butter is to come, and How much meal we shall have? The butter is now at the best, and meal can be had of approved quality: therefore speak your wishes, speak your will,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470827-JWC-ABJ-01">JWC to ABJ, [ca. <date when="1847-08-27">27 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> in these small respects.&#x2014; Poor old Scotsbrig, it is <pb id="pg-22-119" n="22:119"/>a house of melancholy thoughts to me: a house I am sad to arrive at, sad to quit. As indeed most houses are to an atrabiliar man! Take the &#x201C;bright side of thy cloud,&#x201C; as my Mother says.&#x2014; Did I ever tell you about my Portrait (Laurence&#x2019;s) which is hung up here? It hangs on the left side of the mantel-piece (between mantel-piece and window) in my Mother&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">bigger</hi> room; has a good frame, and a kind of yellow gauze over it; is staringly like, incurably sorrowful and ugly;&#x2014;made me start every morning, when I saw it first, for a while; but I am grown used to it now. Poor little Postie, the Ecclefechan hero-worshipper, was often at a loss, he told me, to inform people in what house of the village the sublime genius was born. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott</hi></foreign>&#x2014; But, in brief, I must try if I can get to some <hi rend="italic">work</hi> again soon; for this dead mud-sea of inarticulate stagnancy is really becoming oppressive. And yet, alas, I see no work close; none yet clear and near: the world is really very huge and very chaotic to me at present</p>
<p>Poor little warmingpan of an Anne! But Postie Piper&#x2019;s exposing of his own wife to such a function is perhaps still more heroic.&#x2014; Today along with your Letter came one from John; dull, sparse, vague; from which, however, I gather that he was &#x201C;astonished at your progress in recovery&#x201C; when he saw you last. My Mother is very anxious to have him here again; as many are. He really ought to come. You made a good hand of your &#x201C;game&#x201C;: Geraldine is doubtless eager enough for the Forster verdict:&#x2014;poor wretches, all of us!&#x2014; No Letter yet from Spedding; not till tomorrow. I have answered No to Ironside two days ago. I will out into the rain. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my own poor Jeannie. I will try if I can write another word tomorrow, my last from this place at present; after the packing is done. Did you counsel Forster (of Yeadon Seaport)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps a joke: Yeadon, 6 &#xBD; mi. NE of Bradford, nr. W. E. Forster&#x2019;s home, is not a seaport.</note> to <hi rend="italic">fight shy</hi> a little?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably of the Quakeress; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471005-JWC-TC-01">previous letter</ref>.</note> <closer><salute>Ever yours</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p>I rather expected, among other things, a Note from the Speddings today; but none has come. However, I said, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Unless</hi> you write&#x201C;; so I daresay it is all right still, tho&#x2019; an express affirmative would have been more satisfactory than this assent by silence. If they do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> meet me at Wigton tomorrow, you are nearly certain to hear; for I shall have to wait somewhere <pb id="pg-22-120" n="22:120"/>before readjusting myself, and to write poor Goody a word of my disappointment will be a solace to me: but if they <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, and all go on right, and as rapidly as we may expect, you will probably hear nothing,&#x2014;you may take <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> for the favourablest tidings I have to send.</p>
<p>At post-time today I got a real fright: no Letters at all came, except one, evidently very hurried and very brief, from the Dr: it struck my wise head that you were fallen suddenly quite ill again, and that this must be an express! For it was written, in character and substance, as if with a <hi rend="italic">shovel</hi>, with a Baker&#x2019;s mop, or a street besom; and included only half a page:&#x2014;happily it turned out to be some blotch of a Message about Books on Dante; bad enough when my trunk was all packed, but good and almost welcome in comparison with what I had been apprehending. Tell the galloping Sage that I handed down the old dusty Box he described, and searched thro&#x2019; all the Books; but with all the intellect I was master of, could discover nothing of the thing he calls &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Bargigi</hi> 1 large vol. 8 vo,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the intro. to his trans. of the <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi> John Carlyle says: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Messer Guiniforte delli Bargigi</hi>, a lawyer of Bergamo, who died about <date when="1460-00-00">1460</date>, wrote a comment on Dante, by order of Filippo Maria Visconte, Duke of Milan. Only the part of it which relates to the Inferno has come down to us. This was first published at Marseilles in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>. &#x2026; It is a good, well-arranged commentary, and, amongst other things, explains the literal sense with much distinctness&#x201C; (xxvi).</note>&#x2014;I discovered a dreary dead old <hi rend="italic">folio</hi> (small folio) answering the description otherwise, and packed it in by guess: bought from Rolandi, the property once of one &#x201C;Letham&#x201C; (I think),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >P. Rolandi, London foreign bookseller; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420825-JWC-TC-01"><sic>15:47</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1842-08-25">25 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>. Letham is unidentified.</note> and without title-page of any kind, or trace of &#x201C;Bargigi&#x201C; discoverable anywhere in it. Of the other <hi rend="italic">two</hi> I was moderately certain, but only of one <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> certain: the deuce take all orders that the human intellect (in a day of packing) cannot understand! At bottom I privately believe that all is right, for the august Translator, nevertheless.</p>
<p>Till noon today it rained a very deluge; rain all the way from yesterday morning, four-and-twenty hours and odd: the brooks have all become rivers, and the Cauldron here is roaring like a little Niagara: after noon, it ceased, and the sun broke out again &#x201C;quite c<hi rend="italic">oa</hi>mfortable,&#x201C; as if nothing whatever had happened. For everybody&#x2019;s sake, especially for my Mother&#x2019;s I am very glad; and will hope tomorrow too may be dry.</p>
<p>I have about done all my packing; the &#x201C;honeycomb&#x201C; too is in, safe and snug! My Mother would insist on sending you a pair of coarse knit stockings (tho&#x2019; I said you could never wear them), and two Missionary Narratives, which even I could not here be persuaded to read! Good old Mother. I am to write your name on them at Chelsea, and say &#x201C;from her old withered Mother.&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; Item there are two <hi rend="italic">Hams</hi> here, lying in a barrel <pb id="pg-22-121" n="22:121"/>among sawdust; said to be very fat and good. Specify concerning them, and concerning the Meal and Butter.</p>
<p>Among my acquisitions at Dumfries, the day before yesterday, was a respectable&#x2014;horse-cloth, or rug for wrapping feet in: I expect to profit by it in the cold air between this and Chelsea.&#x2014; Heigho! or &#x201C;Oh Whow!&#x201C; as Graham phrases it. I am in a sad crowdie of emotions and confusions outer and inner at this moment; have to <hi rend="italic">shave</hi> overnight, dress in haste, and be across a mile beyond Ecclefechan at 20 minutes to 7 tomorrow morning; after which a day of whirling, haggling and hurlyburly, not pleasant to contemplate. <closer><salute>God bless thee my poor little <foreign>Bairn</foreign>!

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Let me, before going to bed, write you a little word to set your kind anxieties about me to rest. I prospered today in every particular of my journey, and have nothing but thankfulness to feel in all respects, along with my sad mood at parting with friends so dear to me.&#x2014; Jamie, I think, must have been about the East-moor again (except he <hi rend="italic">staid</hi> at Garthwaite&#x2019;s) before our Train came forward so far: I tried hard, after we had passed the Westgill Burn &#x26;c to get a sight of Scotsbrig, but never could; you, I supposed, were looking at me. I had a carriage all to myself, which was a great comfort. Got well to Carlisle at the due hour; bought an umbrella <hi rend="italic">price half a crown</hi>; could not think of breakfast,&#x2014;did not in fact eat any breakfast today except my tea and egg with you. The <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi> during two hours (spent in wandering about and smoking) was rather wearisome; but at last it ended, and I got to Wigton, still in a carriage all to myself,&#x2014;where James Spedding (the London Spedding), with a fine <hi rend="italic">hooded</hi> carriage and a pair of swift horses, was duly waiting,&#x2014;a cheerful sight to see,&#x2014;and so we instantly dashed away; and, after a pleasant enough drive, arrived here shortly after one o&#x2019;clock. We had no rain at all almost after leaving Wigton, and on the whole got on very well. I could eat no <hi rend="italic">lunch</hi> either, nothing but a bit of nice bread and butter and a glass of brandy-and-water: however, I made amends at dinner; and indeed am very well off now in regard to the eating part of it. I am very <hi rend="italic">tired</hi> truly, and <pb id="pg-22-122" n="22:122"/>much in want of sleep; but having an excellent room and bed, I am like to get rid of that ailment too. In fact I am <hi rend="italic">very well</hi>, dear Mother; and therefore do not trouble your kind heart concerning me any more.</p>
<p>The Painter Laurence is here, a very good little man with much sense; also two Lady Cousins of <hi rend="italic">James</hi>&#x2019;s; and <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi> Spedding (the other Brother) with his Wife<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Emily, b. Headlam (d. <date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380217-TC-TSS-01"><sic>10:32</sic><corr>TC to TSS, <date when="1838-02-17">17 Feb. 1838</date></corr></ref>). The cousins are probably Sarah Anne (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>) and Lucy Isabella (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>), unm. das. of James Spedding (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>) of Summergrove.</note> came over to dinner, and have lately gone away: tomorrow we are all to go to &#x201C;Tom&#x2019;s&#x201C; (this Thomas&#x2019;s house),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Greta Bank.</note> and dine there; at least all the men of us are to go, which will please me quite as well, as likely to be <hi rend="italic">quieter</hi>.&#x2014; A Letter from Jane is here too, a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> short one, enclosing two others of no consequence: she is continuing well.</p>
<p>Whether I shall get off on Monday seems to be a controversy here; but I mean to <hi rend="italic">insist</hi> on it, unless <hi rend="italic">staying</hi> be really pleasanter to me, that is unless <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> &#x26;c go all <hi rend="italic">extremely</hi> well, which perhaps I can hardly calculate on in the present humour I am in. Monday I still look forward to. It seems, if one leave Keswick at 9 in the morning, one can be in London at 11 in the evening; which will answer extremely well.</p>
<p>Dear good Mother, my eyes are falling together: I hope you, for your poor old frail nerves, have got some sleep during the day! You had need enough of it. Thanks to you dear Mother for all your goodness to me; thanks to all of them: they were all good to me. To part from you is sad: but what can we say? God, that made us both, is great, is good: His will be done for this world and for all worlds! Your old age is very beautiful to me, dear Mother; I thank God for you under all conditions I have ever had you in! Good night. Isabella will be tired of reading this long scrawl,&#x2014;or Jenny who, I suppose rather, is performing. <closer><salute>My kind good night to one and all. God&#x2019;s blessing be on you.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear little Jeannie,&#x2014;</salute>I write one word today, on hest of absolute necessity; yesterday it was not possible, as the Posts were situated, and at any rate you could only have got the Letter in the morning instead of evening.&#x2014; Understand then, in brief, that tomorrow (Monday) I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> coming; but that I am on Tuesday; that on Tuesday night at 11 o&#x2019;clock I expect, if all go right, to be at Euston Square, and shortly thereafter at Chelsea beside you, where I shall be very glad again to be. This is the essential of my news; this, in defect of more, will do.</p>
<p>I left Scotsbrig, as per program, at six on Friday morning; wet raw morning; I <hi rend="italic">un</hi>slept (or almost so), tattered to pieces with various confusions and emotions: a more wretched day and night (the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> sleepless one of Friday) I have not had for many a long month. Ah me! my poor old Mother; poor old Annandale, poor old <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> in general! And in that shattered state of the nerves all stands before one with such a glaring ghastliness of hideous reality. However, I did get a little sleep last night; today I am considerably more composed.</p>
<p>James Spedding, with a fine brisk pair of horses and a comfortable <hi rend="italic">hooded</hi> carriage, was waiting for me at Wigton: all went right and well on that side, and a warm welcome was ready for me at Mirehouse (the Father&#x2019;s place), where I found Laurence just come; and T. Spedding with his Wife &#x26;c &#x26;c to do honour to the dinner. Only sleep was none! Your Letter, <hi rend="italic">shortest</hi> of the Letter kind attended me too. Here is the Ambleside missive back again:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably from Mary Arnold, b.

Yesterday we moved hither, close by Keswick, &#x201C;Tom&#x2019;s house,&#x201C; Laurence &#x26; James with me; a beautiful place, in spite of the rain: here is the starting-place of the Coach which <pb id="pg-22-126" n="22:126"/>leads to the Railway, which leads to &#x26;c: I leave this on <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> as I said for Monday would not do for the hospitalities); Tuesday at 9 a.m.;&#x2014;and after various shiftings get to Chelsea, and end these travels for a long while, I hope!

<salute>Dear Mrs Arnold,</salute>
<p>When your kind message overtook me, I was actually present in the Lake Country; accomplishing a long-deferred visit to my good Friends the Speddings of Greta Bank: a visit brief and long-deferred; on my route homewards, too, from my Mother&#x2019;s, and other multifarious pilgrimages; my time all rigorously meted out,&#x2014;due here in so many hours! I hoped that <pb id="pg-22-127" n="22:127"/>perhaps a drive to Fox How,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Arnold home at Rydal, nr. Ambleside.</note> to pay my grateful respects to you, might have been possible in one of my three days (for they were limited to three); but the weather proved entirely unpropitious; and even this could not be accomplished. Yesterday morning, I passed rapidly within a mile and half of you, as I was told; speeding what I could towards the Express Train; and could only glance up your beautiful Valley, and send you in silence many wishes and regrets. So has it ended, for the present. When I may return to that serene country of clear-gushing brooks and silent hills, doubly beautiful to a poor Prisoner in the brick Babylon, is very uncertain; but of course, when I do, Fox How will be vividly in my remembrance.</p>
<p>As it is, your Note has given and gives me great pleasure. One of the bright days of my life is, and remains always, the day I spent at Rugby,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1842-05-06">6</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-05-07">7 May 1842</date>; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420506-TC-MAC-01"><sic>14:180</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1842-05-06">6 May 1842</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420510-TC-TSS-01"><sic>184</sic><corr>TC to TSS, <date when="1842-05-10">10 May 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> in which you also rise in my memory with a noble mournful significance, as well as that other<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Arnold.</note> whom we shall not meet any more on Earth.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here I am, safe since yesternight; and I make haste to tell you so much, lest any delay might give rise to anxieties in you. This is the first Letter I write; and indeed, to judge by the flurried condition I feel in, it may possibly be the only one I shall attempt today.</p>
<p>You had a Letter, I suppose, on Monday, which told you I was to set out next day. &#x201C;Next day&#x201C; (that is yesterday) proved an excellent day for weather; and my long journey, the longest I ever made in one day, was accomplished without any mischance whatever, and without other suffering than that of the fatigue naturally inseparable from such an enterprize. I found I should have got more <hi rend="italic">easily</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sooner</hi>, as well as cheaper, from Ecclefechan itself than I could from Keswick; however, I could not grudge a little inconvenience for the sake of seeing friends who were so kind to me. It was a kind of duty done, moreover; and is now off my hands.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-22-128" n="22:128"/>The &#x201C;Coach&#x201C; that should have run from Keswick to the Railway &#x201C;at nine in the morning,&#x201C; we suddenly discovered, late on Monday evening, to have been given up two days ago! Having announced myself here at a certain hour, I found that there would be nothing for it but to take a <hi rend="italic">hired Gig</hi> for that part of the journey, 22 miles; and such accordingly was the conveyance; a highly agreeable tho&#x2019; a rather dearer one; which set me down in excellent time, near the foot of Windermere Lake; about 1 o&#x2019;clock, after a drive of 3 hours or more (from half past 9 when I left Spedding&#x2019;s): one of the beautifullest mornings, and thro&#x2019; a range of the finest &#x201C;scenery&#x201C; I ever saw. There I sat in my own hired &#x201C;clatch,&#x201C; and smoked tobacco; thinking of you all, as I rolled across the mountains. From the foot of Windermere Lake, a Railway took me to Kendal (perhaps some 20 miles or so);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s train left Windermere station, 4&#xBD; mi. S of Lakehead, Ambleside; the line to Kendal had been open since <date when="1847-04-00">April.</date></note> and there, in few instants the &#x201C;Carlisle and London Express Train&#x201C; came steaming up; into which I got; and was whirled home, at the utmost pitch of human speed all the way,&#x2014;hardly time to snatch the hastiest mouthful of victual, if I had even had the appetite for eating;&#x2014;and so, without any adventure whatever (for I studied to sit <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> all the while) we got to the London end, on the stroke of 11 at night (it is just about 12 hours from Ecclefechan); and in less than an hour after I was set down with all my <hi rend="italic">packages</hi> in my own little habitation at Chelsea,&#x2014;where Jane and Anne were waiting for me with &#x201C;tea and bacon,&#x201C; and other welcomes and refections. My head is a little <hi rend="italic">aky</hi> today, and I feel in a kind of hot condition, as is usual after such a whirl: but I have had a right sound sleep, am otherwise &#x201C;doing well,&#x201C; and shall be quite round into the old track in a day or two. So end my travels for this year. I find another invitation, &#x201C;from a person of quality,&#x201C; lying here for me, or rather two others; but I have not the smallest notion to embark in either as times now stand.</p>
<p>Jane is looking thinner than when I last saw her; but professes to be rapidly improving from her late illness. Jack was here yesterday; very well, and very busy; I expect to see him after dinner today, but it will not be till this Letter is out of my hand. Jane receives your Pair of Stockings with grateful heart; and the Honeycomb&#x2014;alas, alas, she is even now deeply engaged with that! On opening the lower half of the Portmanteau, which had remained untouched since Scotsbrig, it was discovered that the unfortunate Box of Honeycomb had taken to <hi rend="italic">leaking</hi>; that the internal <hi rend="italic">Comb</hi> had broken itself very small, in the shuddering and shivering of the Railway motion; and so had yielded a large supply of the purest liquid <hi rend="italic">honey</hi>; the copious supply of which had proved too much for the Tin Box and its <hi rend="italic">gummed paper</hi>! James Aitken had proposed <hi rend="italic">soldering</hi>, which is indeed the <pb id="pg-22-129" n="22:129"/>only effectual way; I considered gum and paper would do, and so it has come to this. Jane thinks about a Pound or more must have leaked out; but happily it did not get upon the Books or anything it could hurt,&#x2014;only <hi rend="italic">dirty clothes</hi>, in fact, or little more,&#x2014;and so, as it is the one misfortune of the journey, we must take it calmly! Jane seems much pleased with the Gift in itself; and professes to think that she will yet filter it all into a right condition, so that the loss will not be considerable.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I need not go on <hi rend="italic">clattering</hi> in this manner; for really the one important thing I had to say is already said by the mere appearance of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> Letter from me. I will write again very soon when as I hope my head will be calmer. Tell Jamie and Isabella they shall hear about the Butter and Meal in a day or two.

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Sir</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>By a letter I had very lately from Emerson&#x2014;which had lain, lost and never missed, for above a month in the treacherous post-office of Buxton, where it was called for and denied&#x2014;I learn that Emerson intended to sail for this country &#x2018;about the first of October,&#x2019; and infer therefore that probably even now he is near Liverpool or some other of our ports. Treadmill, or other as emphatic admonition, to that scandalous postmaster of Buxton! He has put me in extreme risk of doing one of the most unfriendly and every way unpardonable-looking things a man could do.</p>
<p>Not knowing in the least to what port Emerson is tending, where he is <pb id="pg-22-130" n="22:130"/>expected, of what his first engagements are, I find no way of making my word audible to him in time, except that of intrusting it, with solemn charges, to you, as here. Pray do me the favor to contrive in some sure way that Emerson may get hold of that note the instant he lands in England. I shall be permanently grieved otherwise; shall have failed in a clear duty (were it nothing more) which will never probably in my life offer itself again. Do not neglect, I beg very much of you; and, on the whole, if you can get Emerson put safe into the express train, and shot up hither, as the first road he goes! That is the result we aim at. But the note itself, at all events, I pray you get that delivered duly, and so do me a very great favor for which I depend on you.</p>
<p>It is yet only two days since I got home, through Keswick and the Lake country; nor has my head yet fairly settled from the whirl of so many objects, and such rapid whirls of locomotion, outward and inward, as the late weeks have exposed me to. Today, therefore, I restrict myself to the indispensable, and will add nothing more.</p>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your Letter from Concord, of the <date when="1847-07-31">31st of July</date>, had arrived duly in London; been duly forwarded to my transient address at Buxton in Derbyshire,&#x2014;and there, by the faithless Postmaster, <hi rend="italic">retained</hi> among his lumber, instead of given to me when I called on him! We staid in Buxton only one day and night; two Newspapers, as I recollect, the Postmaster did deliver to me on my demand; but your Letter he, with scandalous carelessness, kept back, and left me to travel forwards without: there accordingly it lay, <pb id="pg-22-131" n="22:131"/>week after week, for a month or more; and only by half accident, and the extraordinary diligence and accuracy of our Chelsea Postman, was it recovered at all, not many days ago, after my Wife&#x2019;s return hither. Consider what kind of fact this was and has been for us! For now, if all have gone right, you are approaching the coast of England;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1847-07-31">31 July</date>, that he was proposing &#x201C;to sail for Liverpool or for London about the <date when="1847-10-01">1 October</date>.&#x201C; But he reported, <date when="1847-09-30">30 Sept.</date>, that he had &#x201C;taken a berth in the packet ship Washington Irving, which leaves Boston for Liverpool, next week, <date when="1847-10-05">5th October</date>.&#x201C;.</note> Chelsea and your fraternal House <hi rend="italic">hidden</hi> under a disastrous cloud to you; and I know not so much as whitherward to write, and send you a word of solution. It is one of the most unpleasant mistakes that ever befel me. I have no resource but to inclose this Note to Mr Ireland, and charge him by the strongest adjurations to have it ready for you, the first thing, when you set foot upon our shores.</p>
<p>Know then, my Friend, that in verity your Home while in England is <hi rend="italic">here</hi>; and all other places, whither work or amusement may call you, are but inns and temporary lodgings. I have returned hither a day or two ago, am free from any urgent calls or businesses of any kind; my Wife has your room all ready;&#x2014;and here surely, if anywhere in the wide Earth, there ought to be a brother&#x2019;s welcome and kind home waiting you! Yes, by Allah!&#x2014; An &#x201C;Express Train&#x201C; leaves Liverpool every afternoon; and in some six hours, will set you down here: I know not what your engagements are; but I say to myself, Why not come at once, and rest a little from your sea-changes,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi> 1.2.</note> before going farther? In six hours you can be out of the unstable waters, and sitting in your own room here: you shall not be bothered with talk till you repose; and you shall have plenty of it, hot and hot, when the appetite does arise in you. &#x201C;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 5.

This is the fact: what more can I say? I make my affidavit of the same; and require you, in the name of Lares and Penates, and Household Gods ancient and modern which are sacred to men, to consider it and take brotherly account of it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Shall we hear of you, then, in a day or two; shall we not perhaps see you in a day or two!

<salute>Dear Laurence,</salute>
<p>A Copy of the Lithograph, done on fit paper and with due care, has arrived here, about half an hour ago;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471010-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1847-10-10">10 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> and, I am happy to say, gives great satisfaction to the female mind. <hi rend="italic">Imprimatur</hi> is decidedly the word; &#x201C;one of the best Portraits we have ever seen&#x201C;: that, on the first blush of the business, is the decided verdict.</p>
<p>Secondary suggestions are these two. The extreme point of the nose a degree too sharp, and cocked-up;&#x2014;to be remedied by some delicate scrape or stroke, if feasible? Item, the <hi rend="italic">Body</hi> of the Figure, owing to what is drawn and to what is not drawn of it, does it not suggest to you a somewhat <hi rend="italic">grosser</hi> man than the very lean original? These are the suggestions of the female mind; coupled with a decisive <foreign><hi rend="italic">Imprimatur cum privilegio</hi></foreign> [Let it be printed as duly authorized].&#x2014; I myself have nothing whatever to say on the matter, except perhaps that the &#x201C;rottenness&#x201C; under the chin and elsewhere still requires a last touch of healing;&#x2014;and to wish you well through this momentous enterprise, and a serene frame of mind restored or continued to us all.</p>
<p>I got beautifully along, to Ambleside and Windermere, that day; most civil, adroit, communicative drivers, blessed sunshine, tobacco at will, and one of the beautifullest regions in all the world, quite free from people doing the Picturesque. <hi rend="italic">After</hi> Windermere, it was one loud crash of tumults, hurries and confusions, which however did land me safe at Euston Square at the due hour. Tell the benevolent James Spedding that his fusees<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matches with large heads.</note> were a blessing to me; that indeed, all the way from Birmingham, I enjoyed, with heartfelt thanks to the gods, a carriage to myself; and, in an atmosphere at length quite free, smoked forth a mild undisturbed cigar into the ambrosial night! I was nevertheless driven half mad before I altogether got home; and am scarcely yet recovered.</p>
<p>Will you offer my very kind regards to every one at Mirehouse and Greta Bank,&#x2014;mild humane hearts, blessings be on them all! Inclosed is a small business memorandum,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps for James Spedding about TC&#x2019;s cap; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471019-TC-TSS-01">TC to TSS, <date when="1847-10-19">19 Oct.</date></ref></note> which pray deliver. <closer><salute>Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>We got your Note; and read it, as we do all writings from you, with pleasure. You should write oftener. Jane says, &#x201C;with few words he always tells me much&#x201C;;&#x2014;which is a fact and an honourable one to a writer!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The result of our meditations on the oatmeal, is that 8 stones of it will be enough; some of the old is still here; but Jane proposes giving it away, as having grown a little tasteless to those that <hi rend="italic">know</hi> good meal. I now rarely take any supper, of porridge or otherwise; but Jane, every night, has a little cup made, and I sometimes; and our little English maid has learned to make porridge better than the average by far; besides one&#x2019;s chance of a little <hi rend="italic">oatcake</hi> now and then:&#x2014;so let us settle for eight stone; and the sooner you send it, and the Butter which I think Isabella has ready, we shall be the blither. Some bacon exists here; but it is of no great excellence, and the price (&#xBD; per lb) is altogether enormous: the two Hams you spoke of, or one of them, if you find an eligible eater for the other, will be very welcome here. I will send two Addresses on Card; and then you can proceed when leisure serves; and the steam carriages will soon bring it from Liverpool to us. Next year, I suppose, Pickford<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Britain&#x2019;s largest moving company. TC means that it might be possible to send goods from Ecclefechan by the Caledonian Railway.</note> will have extended his walk along the Caledonian up to Glasgow itself; and offices may be nearer hand if we have luck to need them.</p>
<p>You must tell my Mother that Jane is <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> the missionary Book (Moffat&#x2019;s),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471013-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1847-10-13">13 Oct.</date></ref> John Carlyle wrote his mother, <date when="1847-10-25">25 Oct.</date>, that &#x201C;Jane finds Moffats missionary book interesting&#x201C; (NLS Acc. 7988).</note> and bids me declare it is the most interesting Book she has read for a great while! This is her voluntary account of it hitherto.&#x2014; And how is my good Mother herself, now that she is left quiet, and alas left solitary, again? Do not neglect to send me punctual word of her; to her I will write duly, so long as I can handle a pen. Isabella and you are both aware <hi rend="italic">how</hi> you can oblige me, and all the rest of us, with a kindness more sacred than any other: continue to do so, I entreat you both; it well behoves me to help in it if I can! What you said of breakfasting down stairs, when winter comes, was very gratifying to me.&#x2014; I have not written to Dumfries yet; but, by symbols if not otherwise, they know my arrival here. By the bye I was to say also that the Honeycomb, all potted up in its crumbled state, is <pb id="pg-22-134" n="22:134"/>not a whit the worse as to taste; and indeed excels any honey we have had for many years.</p>
<p>The Doctor is very well; extremely busy, and I think considerably <hi rend="italic">improved</hi> in his carriage by having some continuous task to do. He gets on but slowly, and does not seem to think of moving from Chelsea yet. I spoke to him of Mrs Howatson&#x2019;s disorder in the breast:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently Isabella&#x2019;s sister, possibly a sister-in-law of William Graham&#x2019;s sister Mrs. Howatson (d. <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>); see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340805-TC-WG-01"><sic>7:256</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1834-08-05">5 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>. John Carlyle wrote to Isabella, <date when="1847-10-27">27 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I am very sorry to hear that your sister&#x2019;s breast has got so much worse. Has she fully carried out the directions I gave her for keeping it all under pressure? &#x2026; Say particularly if the pain is fixed in any one place, if there are any painful knots in the armpits. &#x2026; It is better for you to write privately to me, &#x26; say nothing about it if I find myself unable to suggest any remedy likely to be of use&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> but beyond what I myself had said to Isabella, of which he seemed to approve as safe doctrine, he had not any deliverance to give. Certainly Mrs H. ought to go to some good Doctor with it straightway.&#x2014; Dear Brother, my paper is done for this day, and indeed my time also; for the day is extremely beautiful, and I missed my walk yesterday for rain. <closer><salute>Our united blessings on you all.

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Letter; thanks for all your kindnesses to me, in late days, and in days long past! I too am very glad to have seen you all again; I too hope, and purpose if I live long &#x201C;that it may not be the last time.&#x201C; Greta Bank, under your and the kind Lady&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Emily Spedding&#x2019;s.</note> good stewardship, I can reckon always as one of my possessions in this Earth: a place where Friends live and work, clear-headed, clear-hearted; where, in elegant simplicity, in quiet fulness, solacement for soul and body gratefully offers itself, when my wanderings tend that way. Such possessions are not to be slighted, in so poor a world, by so poor a man. Here and there such a spot, to which our thoughts turn, &#x201C;first makes this waste Earth,&#x201C; says one of Goethe&#x2019;s personages, &#x201C;into a peopled Garden for us.&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Theresa in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi> bk. 7, ch. 5; cf. <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 24:24.</note> My thanks, and my blessings, be with you all always.</p>
<p>I had a beautiful drive that Tuesday morning; the weather, the scene, the equipage altogether agreeable. Your new Farm and Farmhouse in Naddale (is that the name?) was duly pointed out to me; all lay silent, serene in the moist sunny October; the swift Brooks, clear as liquid <pb id="pg-22-135" n="22:135"/>diamonds, sang their best song for me,&#x2014;the last I was to hear of Brooks for a twelvemonth to come: Helvellyn and the everlasting hills, Grasmere steeple and the transitory villages and chapels; things seen for the first time, and things seen long years ago, preached equally a mild and wholesome sermon for me. In silence too, and no reply needed,&#x2014;no falsity, except one volunteered it! I shall long remember that mild solitary morning, and its doctrines and melodies. Once swallowed into the belly of the rail-train, there was of course nothing more to be said or thought, nine hours of tempestuous deafening nightmare,&#x2014;like hours of Jonah in the <hi rend="italic">whale&#x2019;s</hi> belly, I suppose,&#x2014;and one was flung out in Euston Square, glad to have escaped, but stupefied for a week to come. Absolutely I think <hi rend="italic">ether</hi> must come in vogue,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ether as a surgical anaesthetic was first introduced into England in <date when="1846-12-00">Dec. 1846</date>.</note> if men persist in that mode of travelling. To a man who has still his senses <hi rend="italic">left</hi>, the operation is too painful. At Chelsea I found my Wife better than I had expected, and nothing at all gone wrong in my absence; my Wife, I rather judge, continues to amend: I am charged with kind remembrances to Mrs Spedding and you from her, and thanks for your goodness to me.</p>
<p>At Windermere Station, while the tumult of packing went on, a foolish Lady with noisy foolish children in the carriage beside me, pointed out to one of them a figure on the platform as &#x201C;Mr. Coleridge, whom you saw this morning, my da<hi rend="italic">w</hi>ling!&#x201C; The figure, hoary, small, and in clothes <hi rend="italic">too</hi> small for it; with a little switch in its hand, an almost idiotic stereotype simper on its face; apparently taking leave of some female Lakers,&#x2014;instantly arrested all my attention: poor Hartley Coleridge himself, and no mistake!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hartley Coleridge (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5880"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), author and poet, eldest son of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (<date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), on whom TC had declined to call on a previous visit to Spedding; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410902-TC-JWC-01"><sic>13:240</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1841-09-02">2 Sept. 1841</date></corr></ref>.

<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>Yesterday, like a traitor as I was, I forgot to send your Newspaper! Today I send it, with a small Note to boot, expression of my repentance. The excuse was, I was in a terrible hurry all day, wishing to have something finished within time; and never went out at all till after dinner,&#x2014;never remembered, till I was far out on the streets and it was after post-time, that my poor Mother&#x2019;s Newspaper was not yet set on the road for her! That is the real fact; and, like a good boy found in fault, I promise that it shall not occur again.&#x2014; Dear Mother, I know you do not care in the least about this; but I feel the neglect, and will mend it as I can.</p>
<p>We are very well here; and, for the present, and only about a small job, very busy. The small job is, with some Letters of Cromwell; of which you <pb id="pg-22-137" n="22:137"/>shall hear and see, when the thing comes out in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Thirty-five Unpublished Letters of Oliver Cromwell,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 36 (<date when="1847-12-00">Dec. 1847</date>):631&#x2013;54, the faked letters provided by William Squire.</note> A mere <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>; but I decided to have it off my hand; and the reason of my great hurry yesterday was, that I had just learnt Emerson was <hi rend="italic">coming</hi>,&#x2014;who would put an end to work for some time! Emerson accordingly came;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arriving at 10 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi>, <date when="1847-10-25">25 Oct.</date>, when, Emerson wrote to his wife, <date when="1847-10-27">27 Oct.</date>, &#x201C;the door was opened to me by Jane Carlyle, and the man himself was behind her with a lamp in the entry. They were very little changed from their old selves of fourteen years ago (in August) when I left them at Craigenputtock and the floodgates of Carlyle&#x2019;s discourse are very quickly opened, &#x26; the river is a great &#x26; constant stream. We had a large communication that night until nearly one o&#x2019;clock and at breakfast next morning it begun again&#x201C; (Rusk 3:423).</note> is now here with us; arrived just about an hour after my operations were completed;&#x2014;and there has been nothing but <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> talk ever since. He is a fine pure gentle ingenious creature; and we think we shall both like him very well: he has to go back again to Lancashire, and begin <hi rend="italic">lecturing</hi> and so forth in the course of next week. No more of him at present.</p>
<p>Jack was here, as usual, to dinner with us on Sabbath. He is very well and brisk in health, but dreadfully busy with his <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi>,&#x2014;indeed I think working too hard,&#x2014;and we <supplied>[see]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> little of him except when the movement is on our part.

I think I will read it too, dear Mother, if it were for your sake only.&#x2014; &#x2014; By the bye, this <hi rend="italic">ink</hi> is too thick, and much of our ink is: I wonder if Jamie could get two or perhaps <hi rend="italic">three</hi> (no more) of those <hi rend="italic">three-half-penny inkbottles</hi> at Ecclefechan, and stick them among the meal? I suppose they would be quite <hi rend="italic">safe</hi> there, being well <hi rend="italic">sealed</hi>; and they might occasionally be of use to us here. If it cost difficulty, let nobody bother himself with it.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Dear Mother, there was seldom a scraggier Note than this; but my <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> goes with it: I send blessings to you and all.

<p><salute>Dear Sister Jean,&#x2014;</salute>You must think me an abundantly careless and unthankful <pb id="pg-22-138" n="22:138"/>man, in that I have never yet sent you the scrape of a pen<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> since my parting with you, this day four weeks I think! The reason is not want of <hi rend="italic">remembrance</hi>; but many other <hi rend="italic">reasons</hi>,&#x2014;of which we will put off no time with speaking at present. For one thing, I have been very <hi rend="italic">busy</hi> for the last week, and today still am; nay further, <hi rend="italic">Emerson</hi> the American Friend came upon us last night, and is now <hi rend="italic">here</hi>,&#x2014;nothing but talkee talkee;&#x2014;for the rest, a very fine fellow, whom it is pleasant to talk with. He stays &#x201C;till next week,&#x201C; I dimly apprehend; then goes to Lancashire &#x26;c to <hi rend="italic">lecture</hi> to all manner of Mechanics Institutes<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Offering education for workingmen.</note> and the like. He is at this moment rummaging among my Books in this room, beside me; waiting till I have done writing to you!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On Sunday or Yesterday you would get, instead of <hi rend="italic">Douglas Jerrold</hi> who had grown to be quite detestable to me, the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Times</hi> sent off direct by the Saturday&#x2019;s Post; in this, with much rubbish, I have occasionally found some preferable to anything one can get in <hi rend="italic">Jerrold</hi>; this, unless James protest against it, shall be sent weekly in future, will arrive on <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi>. So much for that.</p>
<p>The Honeycomb,&#x2014;alas, I must not forget to tell the fortunes of the honeycomb! Know then that the Tinbox with <hi rend="italic">my</hi> improvement on it did not answer; that James&#x2019; plan of <hi rend="italic">soldering</hi> the Box is, and in all future cases shall be, the only effectual plan. There is a <hi rend="italic">shake</hi> in these railways and express-trains, which jumbles everything to pieces. So I infer, <hi rend="italic">no</hi> means could have saved the honeycomb from being <hi rend="italic">broken</hi> quite small, and all jumbled into a <hi rend="italic">crowdy</hi> [porridge] (if that had been any damage, as it is almost none); but by James&#x2019;s plan we might certainly have kept it all <hi rend="italic">within the Box</hi>,&#x2014;and as matters went, she <hi rend="italic">leaked</hi>, my lassie; leaked about a matter of two pounds, we guessed,&#x2014;but luckily only into some <hi rend="italic">shirts</hi> and such like, mostly <hi rend="italic">dirty</hi> ones too! All is right <hi rend="italic">now</hi>: a couple of pounds of honey was what we lost, and the rest (wax and all, making an original but quite excellent mixture) is safe bottled into small gallipots; and we are eating the Article,&#x2014;and truly it goes like <hi rend="italic">reek</hi>[smoke], for <hi rend="italic">better honey</hi> we never tasted in our lives! You may tell that to Mrs Dick, and to yourself, and take Jane&#x2019;s thanks for your kind trouble, which you see is not <hi rend="italic">lost</hi>, after all. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Sister: the Paper is done, and E&#x2019;s patience too.

<p><salute>&#x201C;Dearest&#x201C; Lady.&#x2014;&#x201C;</salute>Oh <hi rend="italic">no</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">no</hi> NO! for Heaven&#x2019;s sake!&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> not, <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not have said <hi rend="italic">that</hi>; or if I <hi rend="italic">did</hi>,&#x2014;forget it; it was a slip of the tongue!&#x201C;</p>
<p>He is come then,&#x2014;is here this Yankee-Seraph! We have seen him &#x201C;face to face and (over-) soul to (over-) soul&#x201C;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Emerson&#x2019;s essay &#x201C;The Over-Soul&#x201C; (<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>). The first part of the quotation may be from 1 Cor. 13:12.</note> for two days I have lived on the <hi rend="italic">manna</hi> of his speech, and now I have escaped to my bedroom to <hi rend="italic">bathe my head</hi> in <hi rend="italic">cold water</hi>, and report progress to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.</p>
<p>So far, all has gone better than you predicted; they do not <hi rend="italic">hate</hi> one another <hi rend="italic">yet</hi>; C still calls Emerson &#x201C;a most polite and gentle creature! a man of really quite <hi rend="italic">Seraphic</hi> nature! tho&#x2019; on certain sides of him overlaid with mad rubbish&#x201C;&#x2014;and Emerson still (in confidence, to me) calls C &#x201C;a good Child(!) in spite of all his deification of <hi rend="italic">the Positive, the Practical</hi>&#x2014;most astonishing for those who had first made acquaintance with him in his <hi rend="italic">Books</hi>&#x201C;!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Polite</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gentle</hi>, this Emeson certainly <hi rend="italic">is</hi>; he avoids with a laudable tact, all occasions of dispute, and when dragged into it, by the hair of his head, (morally speaking) he <hi rend="italic">gives</hi>, under the most provoking contradictions, with the softness of a feather-bed.</p>
<p>For the rest; I hardly know what to think of him, or whether I like him or not. The man has <hi rend="italic">two</hi> faces to begin with which are continually changing into one another like &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">dissolving views</hi>,&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Produced by a magic lantern, one view growing dim and then gradually replaced by another.</note> the one young, refined, almost beautiful, radiant with&#x2014;what shall I say?&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">virtue its own reward</hi>&#x201C;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:125.</note> the other decidedly old, hatchet-like, crotchety, inconclusive&#x2014;like an incarnation of one of his own <hi rend="italic">poems</hi>! In his speech he is not dogmatical the least in the world, nor anything like so <hi rend="italic">fantastical</hi> as his letters give one to suppose; in fact; except for a few phrases consisting chiefly of odd applications, of the words &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">beauty</hi>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">child</hi>&#x2019;; he speaks simply and clearly, but without any eloquence or warmth&#x2014; What I should say he failed in is what the Yorkshire wool-cleaner called &#x2018;natur&#x2019;&#x2014; He is <hi rend="italic">genial</hi>, but it seems to be with his <hi rend="italic">head</hi> rather than his <hi rend="italic">heart</hi>&#x2014;a sort of theoretic geniality that (as Mazzini would say) &#x201C;leaves me <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>.&#x201C; He is perhaps the most <hi rend="italic">elevated</hi> man I ever saw&#x2014;but it is the elevation of a <hi rend="italic">reed</hi>&#x2014;run all to hight without taking <pb id="pg-22-140" n="22:140"/>breadth along with it.

Elizabeth Bancroft had separately encountered Rogers and Emerson at the National Gallery, <date when="1847-10-27">27 Oct.</date>, when Rogers &#x201C;renewed his request that I would bring my son to breakfast with him&#x201C; and invited her companions &#x201C;as friends and countrymen. &#x2026; I was thankful Mr. Emerson had chanced to be with me at that moment as it procured him a high pleasure&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Letters from England</hi> [<date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>] 144&#x2013;45). For Emerson&#x2019;s account of the breakfast, see Rusk 3:425&#x2013;26.</note> and goes to Liverpool I believe tomorrow night, to lecture &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all about</hi>&#x201C; When he returns to London, as a Lecturer, I fancy he will go into Lodgings&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am sure C. is <hi rend="italic">disappointed</hi>, thinks him, if he would &#x201C;tell the truth, and shame the Devil&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">1 Henry IV</hi> 3.1.</note> a man of no sort of significance&#x2014;but he is still under the restraining grace of Hospitality, and of <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> regard to consistency: besides he has had no opportunity of unbosoming himself to me on the subject, as we have literally not been <hi rend="italic">five minutes</hi> alone together since Emerson arrived: he (Emerson) sits up after me at nights and is down before me in the mornings. till I begin to feel as if I had got the measles or some such thing.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote to his wife, <date when="1847-10-27">27 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Here in this house we breakfast about 9, and Carlyle is very apt, his wife says, to sleep till 10 or 11, if he has no company. An immense talker he is, &#x26; altogether as extraordinary in his conversation as in his writing. I think even more so. You will never discover his real vigor &#x26; range, or how much more he might do than he has ever done, without seeing him. I find my few hours discourse with him in Scotland, long since, gave me not enough knowledge of him; and I have now at least been taken by surprise by him. He is not mainly a scholar, like the most of my acquaintances, but a very practical Scotchman, such as you would find in any sadler&#x2019;s or iron dealer&#x2019;s shop, and then only accidentally and by a surprising addition the admirable scholar &#x26; writer he is. &#x2026; [A]ll his qualities have a certain virulence, coupled though it be, in his case, with the utmost impatience of Christendom &#x26; Jewdom, and all existing presentments of the good old story. He talks like a very unhappy man, profoundly solitary, displeased &#x26; hindered by all men &#x26; things about him, &#x26; plainly biding his time, &#x26; meditating how to undermine &#x26; explode the whole world of nonsense which torments him. &#x2026; Carlyle and his wife live on beautiful terms: Nothing can be more engaging than their ways, and in her book case all his books are inscribed to her, as they came from year to year, each with some significant lines&#x201C; (Rusk 3:424).</note></p>
<p>I have not seen Fleming since his return&#x2014;almost dread the thought of seeing him! of witnessing the progress of his emotions&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear William</salute>
<p>The above was written to send to the Times; but I bethink me, an advertisement will cost five &#x26; sixpence, a letter only a penny, &#x26; so I take the cheaper course.

<p>Emerson is here has been here since Monday night I have seen him &#x201C;face to face &#x26; (over-) soul to (over-) soul&#x201C; &#x26; (I may just as well &#x201C;speak the truth &#x26; chance the Devil) I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> like him the least bit! C. says he is a &#x201C;most polite &#x26; gentle creature&#x2014;a man really of a quite <hi rend="italic">seraphic</hi> nature&#x201C;; &#x26; all that may be true, at all rates C has good cause to say it; for Emerson with a tact as laudable as prudent avoids all occasions of dispute, &#x26; when dragged into it, by the hair of his head, so to speak he receives the most provoking contradictions with the softness of a feather-bed&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">gives</hi> under them for the moment &#x26; so, no &#x201C;dreadful collision&#x201C; takes place, such as I was looking for. But with his <hi rend="italic">politeness</hi> &#x26; tolerance, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> approbation ends. The man has no &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">natur</hi>&#x201C; about him, his geniality is of the <hi rend="italic">head</hi> not the <hi rend="italic">heart</hi>&#x2014;a theoretic systematic geniality that (as Mazzini would say) &#x201C;leaves me <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>&#x201C; In fact you can get no <hi rend="italic">hold</hi> of him&#x2014;nor yet feel <hi rend="italic">held</hi> by him&#x2014;his is neither <hi rend="italic">impressive</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">impressionable</hi> a sort of man I cannot get on with, <hi rend="italic">that</hi>!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here, after an immense and unexpected contest with the ruggedness of my materials, is the Batch of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell Letters</hi>;&#x2014;worked into a kind of <hi rend="italic">Article</hi>; readable beyond hope.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the &#x2018;Thirty-five Unpublished Letters of Cromwell.&#x2019;.</note></p>
<p>Pray let me have a Proof as soon as possible, while my hand is still in.&#x2014; I <pb id="pg-22-143" n="22:143"/>believe the thing will have to be printed <hi rend="italic">in single column</hi> (right athwart the page; not in two columns):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was printed in double column.</note> ragged as the M<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. looks, I have taken great pains to make it intelligible to the Printer; and I think, if you will shew him the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell&#x2019;s Letters and Speeches</hi>, and let him make himself master of the plan of that, he will have no great difficulty here. But <hi rend="italic">three</hi> kinds of writing are to be distinguished by him some way or other; nay <hi rend="italic">four</hi>: mine, my correspondent&#x2019;s, Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s, and Cornet Squire&#x2019;s;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently TC&#x2019;s, William Squire&#x2019;s, and Samuel Squire&#x2019;s, though in fact TC saw nothing but William Squire&#x2019;s alleged copies.

<p><salute>Yes, dear Lady,</salute> Mr C. will write to you again:&#x2014;it was the saddest of all thoughts for him that he never should! But for the present he is pressed together, as if dead, and in a leaden shroud; if you knew him (which happily you do not) you would not wish to hear much of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.&#x2014; There is misery in complaining; there is misery in mixing <hi rend="italic">soot</hi> among ambrosia; so let us close our lips, and say nothing rather.</p>
<p>You <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to be here on Monday fortnight then? That is the important fact; that, and that you are well. I too,&#x2014;except that the <hi rend="italic">Fogs</hi> are dark; the Fogs without and within; and I am not fit to appear before Queens.</p>
<p>Emerson went on Friday night last; I was torn to pieces talking with him; for his sad Yankee rule seemed to be, That talk should go on incessantly except when sleep interrupted it: a frightful rule. The man, as you have heard, is not above bargain;&#x2014;nor, if one will be candid, is he fairly much below it. A pure-minded elevated man; <hi rend="italic">elevated</hi> but without <hi rend="italic">breadth</hi>, as a willow is, as a reed is; no fruit at all to be gathered from him. A delicate, but thin pinched triangular face, no jaws nor lips, lean hook-nose; face of a <hi rend="italic">cock</hi>: by none such was the Thames ever burnt!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> A proud man too; a certain sensitive fastidious <hi rend="italic">stickishness</hi>, which reminded me of a miniature Washington&#x2019;s;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Washington (<date when="1732-00-00">1732</date>&#x2013;<date when="1799-00-00">99</date>), first pres. of the United States.</note> very exotic, tho&#x2019; Anglosaxon enough; rather curious to think of. <pb id="pg-22-144" n="22:144"/>No getting into any intimacy with him, talk as you will. You have my leave to fall in love with him if you can!&#x2014; And so he plays his part: gone to lecture in Lancashire; to return hither he knows not when:&#x2014;it is privately privately<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> hoped he may go to Rome! I wish him honestly well, do as I am bound respect him honestly; but <hi rend="italic">Friends</hi>, it is clear, we can never in this world, to any real purpose, be.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 116, as if he &#x201C;could have loved this man.&#x201C; But TC was to warm again to Emerson.</note></p>
<p>And next a wretched mortal, called Weigall, is &#x201C;modelling my face&#x201C; (an old promise of seven years standing);<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Weigall (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>), sculptor; son of Thomas Weigall and Frances, b. Abbott; m. Selina Smith, emigrated to Australia, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>, with Sir Henry Barkly, gov. of Victoria, and settled at Kyneton. Weigall was an expert cameo and gem cutter, collected paintings, etc., became a clerk of petty sessions and justice of the peace. While in London he seems to have been a friend of TC, William Thomson (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890-00-00">90</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27330"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), archbishop of York, the duke of Wellington, Henry Cole, S. T. Coleridge, and either Edward Sterling or his son Anthony, some of whom apparently corresponded with him after he left for Australia. His busts of TC and Wellington were exhibited at the Royal Academy, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.

What has he to do with my unbeautiful face (of which he will never make a likeness either), the unhappy creature?</p>

<salute>My dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>Let me without delay announce the arrival of the beneficent Scotsbrig cargo of provender,&#x2014;all or nearly all quite safe; and a very welcome sight to us here on every account. Not the least so as a token of Friends unwearied in their kindness to us.</p>
<p>It came, Barrell and Firkin, yesterday; price of carriage /11. All was safe, as I said; all, except the <hi rend="italic">lip</hi> of the poor Doctor&#x2019;s butter-cann: that had got <hi rend="italic">jammed</hi> between the two Hams, or otherwise, and broken: Jane thought the butter would require to be <hi rend="italic">shifted</hi>; but found that there was only a little bit of the <hi rend="italic">butter</hi> laid bare, on one side, or fraction of a side only; and that the butter might still stay where it was;&#x2014;and be sent up to the Doctor <pb id="pg-22-145" n="22:145"/>tonight. Inkbottles had not given way at all, tho&#x2019; there was danger of them; they would have been safer <hi rend="italic">inside</hi> the meal-sack. Hams are pronounced to look &#x201C;excellent,&#x201C;&#x2014;especially one Ham: are they both for us? Yesternight I had a morsel of porridge from the new meal: our little English maid makes porridge well, better than any Scotch one we have had:&#x2014;and certainly no better article in the shape of meal need be desired by a lover of that article. <hi rend="italic">First-rate</hi> meal; a thing precious in these localities, still more than in yours. The Butter we shall be at, probably tomorrow; and doubt not to find it too of the old quality. So that all is right on that side; and we can only send <hi rend="italic">thanks</hi> as heretofore, and feel very much obliged for Isabella&#x2019;s kindness and yours.</p>
<p>We are pretty well; tho&#x2019; the November Fogs (dirty black <hi rend="italic">mist</hi>, full of smoke too) have begun, which is an unfavourable sort of weather. I have been working a little, too; and do not mean to go quite &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bane</hi>-idle&#x201C; any more, if I can help it. I will send my Mother the thing (some new Letters of Cromwell) so soon as it is printed in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>.&#x2014; Emerson, the American friend, went away on Friday evening; back to Lancashire again, where he is lecturing, both in Manchester and Liverpool. How he succeeds may perhaps be a question. We found him a rather <hi rend="italic">thinner</hi> man than was expected; tho&#x2019; a good man, yet not an entertaining man in the highest degree! He kept me <hi rend="italic">talking</hi>, however, and would at no time let me cease: I was quite tattered to pieces; and really glad to be at rest again.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Forster (whom we staid with in Yorkshire) is waiting for me downstairs: I must cease far sooner than I wished. I intend a Letter to my Mother one of these days; take care of her, the good old Mother! Take all care of yourselves: my blessing with you all.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It is a long time since I heard from you; a long time since I wrote to you,&#x2014;a still <hi rend="italic">longer</hi> indeed; so that, however I may regret, there is no room for <hi rend="italic">complaining</hi>: it is my own blame! Your last Letter found me in Yorkshire; wandering about the Country, as I long continued to do, in the brightest Autumn weather; I did not get the <hi rend="italic">Schiller Book</hi> into actual possession till my return home, some little while ago;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470904-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1847-09-04">4 Sept.</date></ref></note> when I found there had a second volume also arrived: Many kind thanks to you for such a Gift. For its own worth, and for sake of the Giver, it is right welcome to me. I finished the second volume last night; my most interesting Book for many months past: in great haste, I send you forthwith a word of hearty acknowledgement;&#x2014;in great eagerness for the Sequel too! The Book does not say who is Editor; have not you yourself perhaps some hand in it? Whoever the Editor may be, the whole world is bound to thank him. Never before did one <hi rend="italic">see</hi> Schiller; the authentic homely Prose Schiller, out of whom the Hero Schiller, as seen in Poetry and on the Public Stage hitherto, had to fashion himself and grow! And truly, as you say, they are one and the same. For the <hi rend="italic">veracity</hi>, and real unconscious <hi rend="italic">manliness</hi> of this poor hungry Schiller of Prose, fighting his battle with the confusion of the world, are everywhere admirable!

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Mr Editor</hi>,&#x2014;</salute> Here is an excerpt, taken long, long ago, from the curious dim old book called <hi rend="italic">Cabala, or Mysteries of State in Letters of Illustrious Persons</hi>, which I will send you for general benefit, and to clear my own <pb id="pg-22-148" n="22:148"/>repositories of it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Cabala, Sive Sinia Sacra, Mysteries of State and Government: In Letters of Illustrious Persons and Great Ministers of State as well Foreign as Domestick &#x2026; . Formerly in Two Volumes, To which is Added Several Choice Letters and Negotiations no where else Published</hi> (<date when="1663-00-00">1663</date>). The excerpts tell how a raiding party crossed the border from Carlisle, <date when="1570-04-18">18 April 1570</date>. After burning Hoddam and Trailtrow, a mounted detachment was sent to deal with places farther W, just N of the Solway: Ruthwell (still today pronounced &#x201C;Rivvell&#x201C;), Cockpool, Blackshaw, Shearington, Banks-end, Lochar, and Locharwood were all familiar then as now to local readers of the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>. TC modernized the text, as he explains, and changed names, spelling, and punctuation from his original; but it is otherwise accurate. His editorial intrusions within square brackets are left unaltered.</note> To Dumfries-shire people it may have some momentary interest. A passing glimpse of the country, caught at first hand, on a critical occasion, near 300 years ago! The old book <hi rend="italic">Cabala</hi>, often cited by historians, is by no means a rare book; but the Letters and other secret documents, being merely huddled together by some ignorant printer, without the smallest attempt at criticism, and the names especially of distant places and persons, being often frightfully mis-spelt, it is an exceedingly dim one, difficult to read,&#x2014;which, accordingly, the general reader avoids, and knows little of. My edition is the second or last (London, <date when="1663-00-00">1663</date>); and the excerpt is from pp. 175&#x2013;6. In any tolerable History of Scotland during the year <date when="1570-00-00">1570</date> (<hi rend="italic">Robertson</hi>, Book VI, for instance), the following state of matters, in the <date when="1570-04-00">April</date> of that year, will become manifest:</p>

(<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>). Book 6 confirms TC&#x2019;s account of the state of affairs. The regent, Lord James Stewart (<date when="1531-00-00">1531</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1570-00-00">70</date>), earl of Moray, had been shot at Linlithgow by James Hamilton (<hi rend="italic">fl</hi>. <date when="1566-00-00">1566</date>&#x2013;<date when="1580-00-00">80</date>), of Bothwellhaugh.

They burned the town of Raywell [Ruthwell, Rivvall], which is the Lord Cockpool&#x2019;s and the Lord Holmains&#x2019;&#x2014;from Carlisle 18 miles. They burned the House of Cockpool [mistake, as we shall see, they couldn&#x2019;t burn that] and the demesne of the Lord Cockpool,&#x2014;from Carlisle 19 miles. They burned the town of Blackshaw, which is the Lord Maxwell&#x2019;s,&#x2014;from Carlisle 19 miles. <hi rend="italic">Item</hi> the town of Sherrington, of the same, 20 miles. <hi rend="italic">Item</hi> the Bank-end, of the same Lord&#x2019;s, 20 miles. <hi rend="italic">Item</hi> the town of Lockerwood, of the same Lord&#x2019;s, 20 miles.</p>

<p>II.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Letter to the Lord Burleigh</hi>.</p>
<p>It may please you to be advertised: According to my Lord Lieutenant&#x2019;s [Sussex&#x2019;s] direction, I entered into Scotland on Tuesday at night last, the <date when="1570-04-18">18th of this April (1570)</date>, and on Wednesday at night encamped at Ecclefechan [Hecklefeugham, elsewhere Ellesingham], within Hoddam, distant from Carlisle 18 miles, and within Scotland 12 miles; and on Thursday in the morning [having burnt Ecclefechan], I sent forth Simon Musgrave, appointed by me as General of the Horsemen, to spoil the country, and to meet me at a place called Cummertrees. And the said Simon burnt the towns of Hoddam and the Mains, Trailtrow, Ryvval, and Cockpool; the town of Blackshaw, Sherrington, the Bank-end within three miles of Dumfries, Lochar and Locharwood,&#x2014;and Ecclefechan (burnt in the morning); <pb id="pg-22-150" n="22:150"/>which towns were of the lands of the Lord Herries and Maxwell, the Lord of Cockpool, and the Lord Holmains [all Popishly given].</p>
<p>And as the said Simon and his company came to old Cockpool, there was the Lord Maxwell with his forces, and the inhabitants of Dumfries assembled; and they skirmished with the couriers, and compelled them to return to the said Simon; and then the said Simon marched into the town of Blackshaw with his company, where the Lord Maxwell was in order, and his forces; and the said Simon and Fergus Graham (Graime), with the number of 100 horsemen, did give charge upon the said Lord Maxwell, and made him flee, and his company also. In which fight there were a hundred prisoners taken; whereof the principal was the Alderman (Provost!) of Dumfries, and 16 of the Burgesses thereof; the rest were footmen. The chase was followed within one mile of Dumfries.</p>
<p>After which conflict the said Simon returned to Blackshaw aforesaid, and burnt it; and seized a great number of cattle, and delivered the same unto certain gentlemen and others to convey unto me. And he the said Simon rode with a hundred horsemen to burn the Bankend, Lochar, and Locharwood. And as the said gentleman [of the Blackshaw cattle], with their company came to a strait place, near unto old Cockpool,&#x2014;the said Lord Maxwell, the Lord Carlyle, the Lords of Holmains, Closeburn, Lag, Amisfield, Cowhill, and Tynwald, with the number of 400 horsemen, and 600 footmen, charged them very sore; and forced them to alight, and draw their company to a strong place, to abide the charge of their enemies. And so they remained until the said Simon came unto them, and alighted, and put his company in order, and set his horses between the company and the sea; and so stood in order to receive the enemy; and in this sort continued, charging and receiving their charges, the space of three hours. I being at Cummertrees aforesaid, a place before appointed between the said Simon and me for his relief (being distant from him three miles), understanding of some distress,&#x2014;sent my band of horsemen with my brother Edward Scroope, and 150 shot (musketeers) with Mr Audley and Mr Herbert, to their relief; and the said Simon, upon the coming of the said band of horsemen and shot, gave the enemy the charge with all his forces; whereupon they fled. In which flight there was taken 100 prisoners; whereof some were of the petty Lords (Lairds) of the country; but the Lord Maxwell, the Lord Carlyle, the Lord Johnston, and the rest before named, escaped, by the strength of the Lord (Laird) of Cockpool&#x2019;s house, and a great wood, and a morass that was near there adjoining. And so the said Simon repaired to me with his company; and so we returned home.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The Book, I believe, is quite printed off; otherwise your kind suggestion, for which at any rate accept my thanks, might have been entertained. Many years ago, indeed almost from the first, it struck me there was something wrong in the passage: but the allusion is not to Kaiser Rothbart in the Kyffh&#xE4;user, with his beard growing thro&#x2019; the marble table &#x26;c &#x26;c, but to Charlemagne himself, concerning whom also there runs or ran such a fable;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The allusion is untraced, but TC is clearly referring to something he has suspected was wrong in the book for many years.</note> so that the error, I suppose, is of <hi rend="italic">Salzburg</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">Aix</hi>, where, and not at Salzburg, beyond peradventure, the Great Emperor took up his last quarters.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great, Works</hi> 12:84, TC repeats the legend, footnoting his sources, about Frederick I&#x2019;s supposed burial, &#x201C;near Salzburg &#x2026; says German Tradition.&#x201C; A peasant is said to have seen him &#x201C;at a marble table, &#x2026; half asleep; beard &#x2026; grown through the table, and streamed out on the floor,&#x201C; waiting to return to reign over a new Germany after a great battle. Kaiser Rothbart or Barbarossa (Redbeard) is the emperor Frederick I (ca. <date when="1123-00-00">1123</date>&#x2013;<date when="1190-00-00">90</date>), the Kyffh&#xE4;user a hill in Thuringia, one of the supposed sites of Frederick&#x2019;s legendary sleep. Charlemagne was also said to be sleeping in various places, including Salzburg. Aix-la-Chapelle or Aachen was the second capital of Charlemagne&#x2019;s empire and his favorite residence after 768.</note></p>

<p><salute>My salutations to you, Lady fair.</salute> I never think of you but when I write, and that is very rarely now. Such is the fact, is it not? I did love you once, but do not any more. A most alarming consideration!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Well, let me hope you have sunshine at Alverstoke; sunshine and a cheerful merry heart, as heretofore. A merry heart is beautiful and a virtue: so is a sad heart too, in its way, provided it can become a composed one.&#x2014; We here are very foggy; clammy dark November weather, the sight of the sun a rarity: today I think it is raining, the other night we had a regular black fog, strong smell of soot and the other accompaniments: we cannot help it; we do entirely believe that the sun still shines, that half a mile above these odious vapours there is nothing <hi rend="italic">else</hi> but sunshine. Which is a glorious faith; and helps one wonderfully along, in the worst of weather.</p>
<p>Today I have not a moment: that infatuated man of chisels claims me, four miles off, in an hour,&#x2014;may the Devil fly away with him!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Weigall.</note> But two journeys more are to finish him: this day week I shall have done with that affair; then let him catch me at it again.</p>
<p>I have burnt up considerable quantities of rubbish: alas, much yet remains; nor is any clear course of action, even in the way of writing Books, yet opened for me. I feel utterly sick of the wretched lake of twaddle in which all things lie soaked and putrefying, and have long lain. For the few years that yet may remain to me I would so fain do something wise and useful! I too have a kind of word to speak; a terrible word, if I could get it out of me. Or if it will stay <hi rend="italic">in</hi> me, may not that be perhaps as good? &#x201C;Fame&#x201C; &#x26;c is literally not worth one penny to me: but it is sad, in this divine universe, to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> an undivine thing; an empty soap-bubble, blown about by every wind, as the others are, and then collapse into a drop of sour suds to all Eternity,&#x2014;trampled down to Hela&#x2019;s realms,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Old Norse mythology Hel (or Hela) was goddess of the dead and queen of the underworld.</note> no place among the Brave, at all forevermore! Really this is <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, tho&#x2019; I phrase it wildly. True too for you, my Heroine,&#x2014;ah me!</p>
<p>I find, by indisputable traces, the first Earl of Sandwich was Captain in Oliver&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Ironsides</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Harriet&#x2019;s ancestor Edward Montagu (<date when="1625-00-00">1625</date>&#x2013;<date when="1672-00-00">72</date>), 1st earl of Sandwich; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440217-TC-EF-01"><sic>17:276</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1844-02-17">17 Feb. 1844</date></corr></ref>. TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;indisputable traces&#x201C; were prompted by the &#x201C;Squire Papers,&#x201C; from which he says we may &#x201C;dimly gather&#x201C; these alleged facts (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:356, 362, 367, 370&#x2013;71), though he also cites Arthur Collins, <hi rend="italic">Peerage</hi> (<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>) (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:376).

<p><salute>My dear good Mother,&#x2014;</salute>I will write you a little word today, tho&#x2019; I have not almost anything to tell you beyond what you heard in Jamie&#x2019;s Letter,&#x2014;no news in fact at all. But I know you will be glad to have the assurance again that we are all well; besides I hope to provoke somebody to tell me more specifically how you yourself are.</p>
<p>Today is very fine weather; and Jane has gone out somewhere, earlier than usual, for some long expedition seemingly, while I sat here up stairs. We have had our fogs too, and customary London puddlings in Novembertime; so that poor Jane could not get out, and has been complaining a little of her head: this day&#x2019;s walk, I anticipate, will do her good. I also will out, the instant I have done this Letter; for the time is is<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> come.&#x2014; Last night we saw Jack, as usual: he is in capital spirits; firing away at his work, which seems to occupy him very much. He has given me a kind of <hi rend="italic">wash</hi> (&#x201C;lotion&#x201C; they call it) for my itchy ankle-spots, which does the wretched little things some good. I suppose they will go away before long, or at least allow me to <pb id="pg-22-154" n="22:154"/>forget them. <hi rend="italic">They</hi>, I think, are all the <hi rend="italic">visible</hi> benefit I have got from industrious use of the &#x201C;hair-gloves,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A glove made of horse hair for rubbing the skin.</note>&#x2014;a renowned invention which does not appear to have suited me very well!&#x2014; I also had a Note from Jean at Dumfries: all well they; but one of Jenny&#x2019;s little Lasses, the Mary one, seemed to have caught some cold. The Irish Beggars too, Jean complains are terribly prevalent about Dumfries!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1847-11-05">5 Nov.</date> Jean Aitken did not complain about Irish beggars but wrote with great sympathy about the family of a &#x201C;little boy with two younger sisters&#x201C; whose mother died on the way from Ireland: &#x201C;I never in my life was <foreign><hi rend="italic">waer</hi></foreign> [sorrier] for any mortal. &#x2026; The number of cases of hopeless misery that one is daily compelled to witness is truly deplorable. &#x2026; But one begins to look on Ireland as a monstrous hospital &#x26; charnelhouse that threatens to overrun the whole world.&#x201C;.</note> They are beginning to be palpably burdensome in some districts of London too. The unfortunate <foreign><hi rend="italic">raggabrash</hi></foreign> [vagabonds];&#x2014;and there is nothing but noise, and falsity and open murder and distruction in their own unhappy Den of Scoundrels: I believe the avenging sword of Heaven, from some quarter or another, cannot fail to alight upon them,&#x2014; and upon us too who are connected with them!</p>
<p>A man of the kind they call &#x201C;sculptors&#x201C; is plaguing me somewhat, in these days, with what he calls modelling my face,&#x2014;that is to say, shaping a figure of it, in <hi rend="italic">clay</hi> first, and then in marble! He will never make a good job of it, poor fellow, for all his pains; but I had promised it long ago, and was obliged to submit. Happily I have now only <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> to sit; he will have done this week: then let him catch me again, if he can! These things are a real bother to <supplied>[a]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> person, who does not like <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [bother], without profit appearing behind it, in one shape or other.</p>
<p>Shortly, I think I shall send you a new Copy of my <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Third edn., 4 vols. (<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), which adds &#x201C;Baillie the Covenanter,&#x201C; &#x201C;Dr. Francia,&#x201C; and &#x201C;An Election to the Long Parliament&#x201C;; advertised by Chapman &#x26; Hall, <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1847-11-30">30 Oct.</date>, as &#x201C;in preparation&#x201C; and, <date when="1847-11-20">20 Nov.</date>, as &#x201C;now ready.&#x201C;.</note> for I see they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> published at last. Your old Copy will then be a superfluous article; you can be thinking of somebody to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> it to,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I daresay you will keep hold till you actually <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the other come to hand! These Books of mine, poor things, bring me in some money now,&#x2014;like cows that give a drop of milk at last, tho&#x2019; they had a terrible time of it as <hi rend="italic">calves</hi>. Let us be thankful: it is better to have one&#x2019;s evil days when one is young than when one is old.</p>
<p>Emerson is lecturing both at Manchester and Liverpool, as you have heard. I rather think his popularity is not very great hitherto; his doctrines are too <hi rend="italic">airy</hi> and thin for the solid practical heads of the Lancashire region.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken wrote: &#x201C;We are curious to see what kind of figure he makes in the way of lecturing; James is intending to write for a Manchester paper to be sent so we may see how he gets on there.&#x201C;.</note> We had immense talking with him here; but found he did not give us much <pb id="pg-22-155" n="22:155"/>to chew the cud upon,&#x2014;found in fact that he came with the <hi rend="italic">rake</hi> rather than the <hi rend="italic">shovel</hi>. He is a pure high-minded man; but I think his talent is not quite so high as I had anticipated.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I must go, while the sun lasts. With you I fear all is mud and damp winds in this winter month: I pray you wrap well, and keep good fires; you must not venture out, except a little way up the dry road on the hill, while the sun is shining. Alas, I have nothing that I can do for you, dear Mother; I am very poor in all but wishes for you! Bid some of them send me punctual word at least how you are.</p>
<p>Tell Isabella the butter is excellent: Jack has got his Pot too; and it is all right.&#x2014; Have you anything suitable to read? I will write again before long. <closer><salute>Your affectionate Son</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your Book-parcels were faithfully sent off, directly after your departure: in regard to one of them I had a pleasant visit from the proprietor in person,&#x2014;the young Swedenborgian Doctor, whom to my surprise I found quite an agreeable accomplished secular young gentleman, much given to &#x201C;progress of the species&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c; from whom I suppose you have yourself heard.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The parcel was probably sent through William Newbery (d. <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>?), bookseller and publishing agent for the Swedenborg Soc., 6 King St., Holborn, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>, one of whose duties was to help William H. Wilkinson, sec. of the soc., <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">60</date>. The Swedenborgian doctor is probably the eldest Wilkinson brother, James John Garth Wilkinson (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1899-00-00">99</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29427"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380802-TC-JJGW-01"><sic>10:141</sic><corr>TC to JJGW, <date when="1839-08-02">2 Aug.</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390928-TC-JJGW-01"><sic>11:189</sic><corr>TC to JJGW, <date when="1839-09-28">28 Sept.1839</date></corr></ref>), Swedenborgian homeopathic physician, librarian of the soc., <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>. Ca. <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, at Wilkinson&#x2019;s request, the soc. is said to have sent TC two of Swedenborg&#x2019;s books (Freda G. Griffith, <hi rend="italic">The Swedenborg Society <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date></hi> [<date when="1960-00-00">1960</date>] 17). Emerson knew of Wilkinson since receiving his <hi rend="italic">Remarks on Swedenborg&#x2019;s Economy of the Animal Kingdom</hi> (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>) and admired Wilkinson&#x2019;s &#x201C;piece preliminary to Swedenborg&#x2019;s &#x2018;Outlines on the Infinite&#x2019;&#x201C; as &#x201C;much the best piece of criticism on Modern Opinions, especially Transcendentalism, which has been written&#x201C; (Rusk 3:342, 414). TC may have already met Wilkinson; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430500-TC-JJGW-01"><sic>16:158</sic><corr>TC to JJGW, <date when="1843-05-05">5 May 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> The wandering Umbrella, still short of an owner, hangs upon its peg here, without definite outlook. Of yourself there have come news, by your own Letter, and by various excerpts from Manchester Newspapers.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote to TC, <date when="1847-11-05">5 Nov.</date>, from Manchester (where there was a Swedenborgian church of the New Jerusalem), that he had met many of TC&#x2019;s friends in Manchester and Liverpool and was enjoying &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">penny correspondence</hi>,&#x201C; some of which consisted of answers to &#x201C;suggestions from good Swedenborgists &#x26; others for my better guidance touching the titles of my discourses, &#x26;c, &#x26;c.&#x201C;.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gl&#xfc;ck zu</hi></foreign> [Luck to you]!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-22-156" n="22:156"/>This morning I received the Enclosed, and send it off to you without farther response. Mudie, if I mistake not, is some small Bookseller in the Russell-Square region;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Edward Mudie (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890-00-00">90</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19492"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), stationer and bookseller; b. in Cheyne Walk; founder of Mudie&#x2019;s Lending Library, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>. His interest in American Transcendentalism led him to publish Emerson and Lowell, <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>, then a few one-vol. novels. His shop was at 28 Upper King St. (now Southampton Row), Bloomsbury.</note> pray answer him, if you think him worthy of answer. A dim suspicion haunts me that perhaps <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was the Republisher (or Pirate) of your first set of <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18431031-TC-RWE-01"><sic>17:163</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1843-10-31">31 Oct. 1843</date></corr></ref>. A pirated edn. of Emerson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> was pbd. by W. Tweedie. Mudie, however, pbd. Emerson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Man Thinking, an Oration</hi> (<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>).</note> but probably he regards this as a mere office of untutored friendship on his part. Or possibly I do the poor man wrong by misremembrance? Chapman could tell.</p>
<p>I am sunk deep here, in effete Manuscripts, in abstruse meditations, in confusions old and new; sinking, as I may describe myself, thro&#x2019; stratum after stratum of the Inane,&#x2014;down to one knows not what depth! I unfortunately belong to the Opposition Party in many points, and am in a minority of One. To keep silence, therefore, is among the principal duties at present.</p>
<p>We had a call from Bancroft, the other evening. A tough Yankee man; of many worthy qualities more tough than musical; among which it gratified me to find a certain small under-current of genial <hi rend="italic">humour</hi>, or as it were <hi rend="italic">hidden laughter</hi>, not noticed heretofore.</p>
<p>My Wife and all the rest of us are well; and do all salute you with our true wishes, and the hope to have you here again before long. Do not bother yourself with other than voluntary writing to me, while there is so much otherwise that you are obliged to write. If on any point you want advice, information, or other help that lies within the limits of my strength, command me, now and always. <closer><salute>And so Good be with you; and a happy meeting to us soon again. Yours ever truly,</salute></closer></p>

<p>My dear Mother,&#x2014;My time is quite gone, over these <hi rend="italic">Proofsheets</hi> &#x26;c (for <pb id="pg-22-157" n="22:157"/><hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>, which you shall see by and by);&#x2014;and I have not a moment to write you all I intended.

Wear them, and think of us!&#x2014; I never acknowledged the bar of Soap you sent me: thanks, thanks, had it been a wedge of Gold, it could not better have testified your affection to me, dear Mother!&#x2014;</p>

We are all well: I am busy, as you heard, with these Cromwell Proofsheets for <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>, which I will send you the result of, before long.

<p>You have managed extremely well, I think, with such typographic resources.

My own notion is in the affirmative. Do you decide it. Some space also, with advantage on all sides, will be saved among the <hi rend="italic">Scraps</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nine &#x201C;miscellaneous Scraps, transitory jottings of Lists and the like&#x201C; (650&#x2013;51) were appended (651&#x2013;54).</note></p>
<p>I did not get the <hi rend="italic">Copy</hi> back; and there is one word in Letter No. 16 which I must request <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to correct, or to send me that leaf of the MS.,&#x2014;since otherwise it will cost me great trouble. One or two other words I have satisfactorily corrected by guess. In the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, we ought to be very correct indeed.</p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I have written to Stewart about <hi rend="italic">Satter</hi>; asking whether he imagines they would sell it separately, and what he reckons a cheap price for it might be. I will tell you about his Answer when it comes: but I do not think he will feel himself free to tell me much about the thing; being appointed to <hi rend="italic">sell</hi>, he cannot well give very frank direction as to buying.&#x2014; I now wish you to take the business up practically into your own hand, and after leisurely reflexion and examination give me some account of your ideas upon it. You can examine the ground, and learn with some exactness how much there is of <pb id="pg-22-160" n="22:160"/>it, of what quality it is &#x26;c; also get some account of the Dwelling house and offices;&#x2014;and on the whole tell me what you think it could be let at by the year, and in short what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would consider the real worth of it to be. Having heard both you and Stewart on the subject, there will, as I told him too, be more scope for either going forward, or withdrawing altogether.</p>
<p>The Doctor does not <hi rend="italic">bite</hi> at the speculation, tho&#x2019; he does not seem indifferent to it either: he perhaps rather wishes <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to bestir myself in it, and will then see what can follow for one or other of us.</p>
<p>As for me, you know I have long wanted some kind of house in the country, where I could, if not stay altogether, run down for shelter in hot or otherwise unpleasant months, and stay till I was completely tired of &#x201C;silence&#x201C;: Satter is too far off, and the House I doubt is none of the best; but then on the other hand it is in my Home Country, close by my Mother and you all: that is a great point! At worst, if the place were to be had <hi rend="italic">cheap</hi>, and I had something like the cash that would buy it, I might as well invest the cash there as in the Dumfries Bank: I suppose the interest would be quite as good, and the security not worse, but better if need were. You may let me hear about it, therefore, at any rate; and I may keep the thing hanging as a pleasant <hi rend="italic">possibility</hi>, till we see it decided one way or other.</p>
<p>I have sent off a copy of the new <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> for my Mother; it will be at Dumfries about the beginning of next month: there is nothing new in it but those Papers in the last Volume. Some other Books, I still expect, may go along with it for my Mother, She got the wool <hi rend="italic">soles</hi>, the other day, by Post? I hope she takes care of herself in this <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> of the winter; that I believe is the worst season of all.&#x2014; &#x2014; I am not quite idle; yet a long way from being very busy on any <hi rend="italic">great</hi> thing. I am rather sorting rubbish out of my way; as a preparation for perhaps <hi rend="italic">small</hi> things. We are all well; bright weather, with <hi rend="italic">frost</hi> in the air; Jane already crying out of cold. The oatmeal is admirable: I have a small dish of porridge every night,&#x2014;with &#x201C;thanks to the <hi rend="italic">Maker</hi>.&#x201C; I sometimes think I am growing <hi rend="italic">better</hi> in health! <closer><salute>My affection to my Mother, to Isabella and you all.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>You have written a charming Book;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC seems to have been reading the MS or proofs of Forster&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Life and Adventures of Oliver Goldsmith</hi>, pbd. mid-<date when="1848-04-00">April 1848</date>. On the same day he also wrote out, as an autograph, the last verse of his poem &#x201C;Today,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 26:475: &#x201C;Here hath been dawning / Another blue Day; / See that thou let it not / Slip useless away&#x201C; (MS: Maggs catalogue 785 [Spring <date when="1949-00-00">1949</date>], item 568).</note> which will lie on many drawing <pb id="pg-22-161" n="22:161"/>room tables, and be read with pleasure, now and henceforth by many ingenuous human souls. An artistic Picture of the 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Century, and a moral Discourse on it, both in one. The Picture crowded with bustling life, vivid figures, as &#x201C;in skyblue coat and red waistcoat,&#x201C; starting everywhere from the canvas; nothing can be more vivid, and as they say, &#x201C;picturesque,&#x201C;&#x2014;which means, I suppose, the best merit in a <hi rend="italic">Picture</hi>:&#x2014;of the morality of the Discourse we must at least say that it is human (which is saying a good deal, in these times), that it is pious to the noble Dead, and tends all in the right direction. These are truths that I write to you: I have not, for a long while, read any English Book that pleased me so well.</p>
<p>And now for the objections,&#x2014;really I have no objection; or none that can or could be remedied! The essential objection, I fancy, is, that you had not a better hero than poor Goldy; that you had not a higher virtue than good-nature, good-humour, and a certain Irish &#x201C;keep never minding,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410409-JWC-TC-01"><sic>13:85</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1841-04-09">9 April 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> to celebrate and deify! Certainly poor Goldy is but a weak wire to string his century upon,&#x2014;poor fellow, his contribution to it, that of painting one or two small Pictures <foreign><hi rend="italic">de genre</hi></foreign> in a happy manner, which still hang pleasantly on our walls, was essentially not a great one. He built nothing, pulled down nothing; changed nothing in any way for the better or the worse; merely painted his dainty little <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tableaux de genre</hi></foreign> [genre pictures], under thriftless imprudent insolvent circumstances; and generously left them to us, and went his unknown way. Poor Goldy&#x2014;and yet you may say justly, What help? I could get no <hi rend="italic">better</hi> hero in that century, no other that would suit my purpose! True enough, the blame is not essentially yours:&#x2014;and it is beautiful withal to see, as you shew us, how one of Nature&#x2019;s own Gentlemen may live, and do some kind of work that is worthy of him, under the husk of a poor ragged Irish Slave (for such poor Goldy was); which also is a kind of Gospel! All this is &#x201C;true for you&#x201C;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Emerson, &#x201C;Self-Reliance.&#x201C;.</note>&#x2014;and yet I say, mind the <hi rend="italic">per-contra</hi> of it too, which is here urged; and take care of your Fourth and concluding Part;&#x2014;and get done with it, and send me a copy!</p>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>As my letter to Jeanie would give you news of me the very same day that yours arrived here, I thought it best to wait till you should have returned to Maryland Street<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Auchtertool.</note>&#x2014; Letters are never more welcome, I think, than just on one&#x2019;s first home-coming&#x2014;it is the first thing that gives one the feeling of being <hi rend="italic">settled</hi>.</p>
<p>For two weeks we had been living in that extraordinary <hi rend="italic">substance</hi> called <hi rend="italic">November-London fog</hi>, which, not being <hi rend="italic">born</hi> to it, I can never reconcile my mind to, any more than my body. But this week we are suddenly dried up into frost&#x2014;and the suddenness of the thing has all but laid me up already. I am determined to take all possible care of myself this winter having not yet forgotten the horrors of the last,&#x2014;so yesterday instead of going to Notting Hill to see a <hi rend="italic">bust</hi> of my Husband which Weigall had finished, and appointed four o&#x2019;clock for showing me&#x2014;I lay on the sofa, wrapt in a horse-cloth&#x2014;and so soon as tea was over went to bed&#x2014; It looked shockingly <hi rend="italic">unfeeling</hi> not to rush off in omnibuses to see my husbands bust, <pb id="pg-22-163" n="22:163"/>under the condition of having to return thro&#x2019; the cold dark night&#x2014;but it would have been still more unfeeling to have thrown my Husbands wife into an inflamation of the chest, under which no woman however well disposed can discharge her household duties&#x2014; Today my <hi rend="italic">portentous</hi> sensations which I have learned to know pretty well by this time, are subsided but I do not mean to quit the house, till I feel that it will be good for me.</p>
<p>We dined with Forster <hi rend="italic">in chambers</hi> one day last week, and I selected from his large most miscellaneous Library a great cargo of books&#x2014;as it were in the spirit of divination; that I might have reading enough for a whole <hi rend="italic">shut up</hi> winter! Among the rest <hi rend="italic">Antidotes against the Causes that abridge human Life</hi> (which Forster read <hi rend="italic">Means of abridging human Life</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Hints for the formation of character</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Human body in health and disease</hi>!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >All untraced.</note> These three at least will be appropriate reading. Speaking of Books&#x2014;my Uncle will receive a copy of the new edition of C&#x2019;s Miscellanies, in the beginning of the month&#x2014; If I had known sooner that you were without <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">want</hi> would have been sooner supplied&#x2014; I will enclose today a little topographical paper which C &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">shot</hi>&#x2019; out of his &#x201C;rubbish&#x201C; heap, the other day, into the Dumfries Courier<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471105-TC-JM-01">TC to JM, <date when="1847-11-05">5 Nov.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; My Uncle is one of the few human beings who can be expected to take any earthly interest in it.</p>
<p>At the same moment yesterday that a &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Devil</hi>&#x2019; came to the door with a <hi rend="italic">proof</hi> for C of a <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> he is publishing in the next <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>, another <hi rend="italic">Devil</hi> handed in a <hi rend="italic">proof</hi> addressed to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>! The first sheet of Geraldines <hi rend="italic">Half Sisters</hi>. Forster who has<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NLS 1893.122 ends here.</note> kindly charged himself with the getting out of this book for her, insisted that if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would not absolutely correct all the <hi rend="italic">proofs</hi> for her myself. I would at least read them carefully over and &#x201C;score out or alter any <hi rend="italic">exceptionable passages</hi> as my own <hi rend="italic">great good sense</hi> (!) should suggest.&#x201C;&#x2014; Bother!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The lower half of the page has been torn off, possibly because of further comments on marriage.</note>&#x2014; &#x2026; . B&#xF6;lte is returned from Germany all agog with <hi rend="italic">something</hi> that she calls &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the new ideas</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;above all quite rabid against <hi rend="italic">marriage</hi>. Varnhagen, Bettina,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth (Bettina) von Arnim, b. Brentano (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360412-TC-JOST-01"><sic>8:332</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1836-04-12">12 April 1836</date></corr></ref>), a member of the salon of Varnhagen&#x2019;s wife Rahel. She showed in her work <hi rend="italic">Dies Buch geh&#xF6;rt dem K&#xF6;nig</hi> (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>) how she had moved from Romantic expression of tender feelings to political engagement and concern for the social effects of industrialism. She apparently embraced the liberal and even revolutionary ideas and aims, including &#x201C;emancipation of the flesh,&#x201C; of Young Germany, whose literary works offended conventional circles in Germany and were subject to censorship and legal prosecution. B&#xF6;lte wrote to Varnhagen, <date when="1847-11-16">16 Nov.</date>, that she had called at Cheyne Row, where she found JWC, &#x201C;my tender friend, &#x2026; sitting comfortably in front of her fire&#x2014;still very pale, but better, nevertheless.&#x201C; TC, she remarked, &#x201C;knows nothing about our recent literature, not even the names.&#x201C; He was &#x201C;very critical of women, poor things&#x2014;presumably because of one particular one. He told me, we are good for nothing but obeying men, and sewing shirts. That was a new theory of his, and [I said] I wished that the good Lord had paused for a while after creating Man and left it at that. He and his brother couldn&#x2019;t stop laughing at that, and I too, though I can&#x2019;t see what there was to laugh at&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 48&#x2013;49, trans.).</note> all the <hi rend="italic">Thinkers</hi> of Germany she says have <pb id="pg-22-164" n="22:164"/>arrived at the conclusion that marriage is a highly <hi rend="italic">immoral</hi> Institution as well as a dreadfully disagreeable one and that the only possible</p>

<p>Sure enough we are in &#x201C;the gloomy month of November when the people of England commit suicide&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced, but a common French joke against the English in the eighteenth cent.</note>&#x2014;under &#x201C;attenuating circumstances&#x201C;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> The <hi rend="italic">ex</hi>pediency, nay necessity of <hi rend="italic">suiciding myself</hi> is no longer a question with me; I am only uncertain as to <hi rend="italic">the manner</hi>!</p>
<p>On Thursday I was appointed to go to Notting Hill to see my Husbands <hi rend="italic">Bust</hi>, and had to break my appointment. <hi rend="italic">Unfeeling</hi> as it looked to let myself be withheld by any weather from going to see my Husbands bust; I thought it would be more <hi rend="italic">really</hi> unfeeling to risk an inflamation in my Husband&#x2019;s Wife&#x2019;s chest, which makes my Husband&#x2019;s wife such a nuisance as you, an unmarried man, can hardly figure.</p>
<p>Since then, I have mostly lain on the sofa&#x2014;under the horse-cloth&#x2014; &#x201C;reading with one eye shut, and the other not open&#x201C; (as poor Darley used to say)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360401-JWC-HW-01"><sic>8:330</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1836-04-01">1 April 1836</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410429-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>13:121</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1841-04-29">29 April 1841</date></corr></ref>. George Darley (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), poet, dramatist, and friend of the Carlyles.</note> some of those divine volumes you lent me&#x2014; Surely it was in the spirit of divination that I selected <hi rend="italic">The Human Body in Health and Disease</hi>&#x2014;And &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The means of abridging human Life</hi>&#x201C; And <hi rend="italic">Hints on the formation of character</hi>&#x2014; One has such leisure for forming one&#x2019;s character during a <hi rend="italic">shut up</hi> winter!</p>
<p>You perceive whither all this is tending and wish that I would hasten at once to the catastrophe&#x2014; Well the catastrophe is&#x2014;I write it with tears in my eyes&#x2014;that I cannot venture to the Play on Monday night. Even if I did not, as is almost certain I should, bring on my <hi rend="italic">cough</hi> I should pass for <hi rend="italic">capricious insane</hi>&#x2014; And the worst of it is, C. having no longer a duty to <pb id="pg-22-165" n="22:165"/>fulfil&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">in promoting my happiness</hi>&#x2014;declares that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> wont go either&#x2014;and that I had best write to you that you may take no seats for us&#x2014;</p>
<p>I do so unwillingly&#x2014;for if the weather were to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">go</hi> soft&#x201C; as Geraldine would say, I might be <hi rend="italic">about</hi> again on Monday and in any case, he <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to go to his friend&#x2019;s first night.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Taylor&#x2019;s dramatic poem <hi rend="italic">Philip Van Artevelde</hi> (<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), abridged and adapted to the stage by William Charles Macready (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17741"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), actor-manager whom the Carlyles had known since <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, was produced at the Princess&#x2019;s Theatre, Mon., <date when="1847-11-22">22 Nov.</date></note> But there is no rebelling against Providence&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Unfortunately I possess no Letters of the late Dr Chalmers; indeed, except one small Note appointing the time of his last visit to me, I do not think I ever had the honour to receive any.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He received one dated <date when="1841-09-29">29 Sept. 1841</date>.</note> That small Note itself has fallen <pb id="pg-22-166" n="22:166"/>aside, for the moment; perhaps has been given away as an Autograph. On this side therefore I regret that I can do nothing for you.</p>
<p>Of the visit alluded to it is natural that we retain a quite peculiar remembrance here.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470220-TC-TCH-01"><sic>21:166</sic><corr>TC to TCH, <date when="1847-02-20">20 Feb. 1847</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470521-TC-MAC-01"><sic>217</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1847-05-21">21 May 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> The venerable man sat with us about an hour; it was five-and-twenty years since I had last seen him face to face; with my Wife, too, much had changed since their last meeting: impressive circumstances for an interview with any one;&#x2014;and we both of us had to remark, when this ended, that hardly ever in our lives had we seen so beautiful an Old Man! From such <hi rend="italic">Old Men</hi> came the titles <hi rend="italic"><foreign>Signor</foreign>, Priest</hi>, and other names of honour found in all nations; when the world was of other temper than it now is! In few days more, came solemn news that Death had set its seal on all this, and transfigured it for us into the Eternal. As a mournfully beautiful, and indeed intrinsically sacred thing, it remains to us henceforth. &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>I would gladly help in your <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> if I could; for its tendencies, so far as I can note them in my remoteness from all the controversial and other transitory circumstances of the matter, are such as I well sympathize with. But, as you remark, my hand is quite out in the reviewing department; and how to resume the business, under existing conditions, is very questionable. Not for the want of enough to say; alas, no: but, by my own blame or the world&#x2019;s, I get ever farther turned away from all manner of beaten highways with their turnpikes; and am forced to seek an ulterior goal, by intricate paths, where the blessings of companionship are not to be expected in my time.</p>
<p>However, I do sometimes think of certain utterances which might take effect by the vehicle of a <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> perhaps as well as otherwise: if it be so decided, and I find that my ideas, on any subject pressing me to write of it in that way could at all suit with your conditions, it will give me real pleasure; I will think the matter over; and you may depend upon it, if occasion do at any time serve, I shall not forget you.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC contributed nothing to the <hi rend="italic">North British Review</hi>.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>Here is Stewart&#x2019;s Letter about <hi rend="italic">Satter</hi>; which does not run in a very encouraging strain. The place is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be sold separately, unless they cannot help it; and the price is a &#xa3;500 beyond expectation!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stewart wrote, <date when="1847-11-20">20 Nov.</date>, warning that the price would be over &#xa3;2,000: &#x201C;It is a very suitable Lodge for your views&#x2014;but would require some rooms to accomodate both you &#x26; a tenant.&#x201C; At the top of the letter TC wrote: &#x201C;You can <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> this&#x2014;immediately. <hi rend="italic">Show</hi> it, of course, to nobody.&#x201C;.</note> Nay I have not so much money; and it would not do to get into debt for such an object.&#x2014; However, there may much happen before the actual sale; and I should think it likely that buyers might be rather <hi rend="italic">scarce</hi> for them in such a season as this. What I want you to do therefore is (at your leisure and deliberately) to make up your mind to a <hi rend="italic">guess</hi> what the place is really worth by the year: I will then write again to Stewart, intimating that I do not think of trying to <pb id="pg-22-168" n="22:168"/>give <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> so-and-so, but that I should like to hear before the place is actually sold. This will do:&#x2014;and you need not be advised that <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> (so far as possible) in regard to such a matter will be eligible: say nothing of my purpose to anybody; nothing of the thing at all, that you can help.</p>
<p>We are well here keeping up in spite of very changeable weather; the Town getting crowded again, owing to the Meeting of Parliament. I had a <hi rend="italic">long walk</hi> yesterday, but it seems only to have stirred up <hi rend="italic">bile</hi> in me as yet I must out again, for the Sun has not got the better, and shews face after the muddy morning. I send my Mother a leaf of the <hi rend="italic">Article</hi>; the Article itself I hope to send, with some Books, before long. I wish we heard <hi rend="italic">again</hi> as good news of our Mother! <closer><salute>My affectionate regards to you all.</salute></closer></p>

And so enough of Books.</p>
<p>We have an exceeding puddle of a day, our fine fresh weather having all melted into mud and rain this morning. I am for the <hi rend="italic">Country</hi> for a walk today, in my dirty clothes, since all is <hi rend="italic">dirt</hi>. Moreover very little time is left <pb id="pg-22-169" n="22:169"/>me; for I have sat all the morning away, over Books.&#x2014; Jane, tho&#x2019; confined to the house these two days by the mud, is pretty well; busy just now with <hi rend="italic">tailoring</hi> a little. I saw Jack yesterday, and only saw him: he was making homewards in haste, from the Library; he is very busy, and I daresay much happier than in former times. He takes a terrible <hi rend="italic">hold</hi> of his work; and will not slight it on any account; which surely is a laudable feature of him. Our Parliament has begun again;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1847-11-23">23 Nov.</date></note> but they are not likely to throw much light on anything human or divine; so we do not as yet heed them. They are like to have a winter of it,&#x2014;they that take charge of &#x201C;governing&#x201C; this country! A good deal of sickness, we hear, begins to shew itself in these parts; Ireland is full of starvation and murder; and in England all is locked up for want of money. Happy for <hi rend="italic">us</hi> that we have no general charge to take of all that; but can sit quiet in our own little cells!&#x2014; One of our neighbours here was kicked to death by a wild horse he had; it attacked him in the stable one night: he was a horse-<hi rend="italic">fancier</hi>; an extensive Coal-merchant, not a poor man.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Bettworth, corn and coal merchant, 1 Cheyne Walk.</note> His eldest son is since dead of fever.</p>
<p>I am puddling away amid my abstruse affairs here; it will be a good while, I believe, before you hear much of me in print. But I ought not to be idle; nor do I mean it&#x2014; Jamie had a Letter from me, about <hi rend="italic">Satter</hi>, the other day: I scarcely hope much good will come of that affair; however, let us see it handsomely to the end.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014; Dear Mother, I am growing rather impatient to hear some little word of you again: How are you? How do you resist the dark season? I wish I knew!&#x2014; The Paper is done, and the <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> will admit no more. <closer><salute>Blessings with you all. /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>One of these days there will a Parcel of Books come to you; which consists merely, I think, of two Copies of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> (a new edition of which is out); one of them for my Mother, the other for Stewart of Gillenbie.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stewart had written, <date when="1847-11-20">20 Nov.</date>, that he already had the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> but &#x201C;will not limit your bounty &#x2026; but will accept with great pleasure &#x26; thankfulness this new edition.&#x201C;.</note> You will have to pay the carriage, and mark it against me; and to send Stewart&#x2019;s Copy off to him by your first convenience As to Mother&#x2019;s Copy, I want it <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> before it go to her: therefore, pray take instant order about that. Get the Book bound, in some decent effectual way, so as you think will suit my Mother&#x2019;s taste best; then send it to her, and the whole account to me,&#x2014;without delay! She already knows that it is coming or come to you; therefore the <hi rend="italic">sooner</hi> the better. I trust to you farther for seeing it <hi rend="italic">well</hi> done. The good Mother has at present nothing but the <hi rend="italic">American</hi> Edition;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(Boston, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>), or the second U.S. edn. (Philadelphia, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>).</note> and of course it is very fit that she have the Book in full, and in its best state.&#x2014; This is all of message that I had to send: no doubt is entertained but you will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it with all fidelity, and without more specification being needed.</p>
<p>There is just coming out a new Edition of the <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi> too; but I think you are all supplied with that. This contains nothing new except an <hi rend="italic">Index</hi>, and I suppose it is better printed than any of the others. I have a copy or two to dispose of, if anybody specially requires them; but I keep them lying here, as there is no hurry.&#x2014; The slow Bookseller<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Chapman; the third edns. of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>.</note> has never yet called to pay me for those two Books; but he will have to do it, for all the <pb id="pg-22-172" n="22:172"/>&#x201C;pressure&#x201C; of the money-market he complains of! There is also to be an edition of poor <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> again, before long.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Third London edn. (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>).</note> It seems very strange, and is indeed almost <hi rend="italic">pathetic</hi> to me, that these poor bits of Books should still be read, and now yield some &#x201C;meat, clothes and fire&#x201C; to me: but so it is, and I ought to be silent and thankful. They were written in sore tribulation; the children, as it were, of mere sorrow and tears: but it is best if one can get one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">weeping</hi> over, if one has to weep, at the <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> than at the end of the account!&#x2014; &#x2014; I had one or two poor insignificant duds of volumes that I meant for yourselves; but was too late with them: so they may lie till another occasion. Furthermore: I do not now know what the <hi rend="italic">conveniences</hi> of Carriage to Dumfriesshire accurately are; which, namely, is the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> method now of getting a Parcel to Annandale, or even to you? The railway carries Parcels at 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> a pound direct to Ecclefechan: is not that perhaps the best method? Jack even throws a doubt on your having now a Coach or Conveyance from Edinburgh: but indisputably you have <hi rend="italic">some</hi> mode of communication still! Say a word about this, for my instruction, when you write.</p>
<p>We had a Note from Scotsbrig the other night, which keeps us still in some anxiety. Our poor Mother, on Saturday morning last, felt such <hi rend="italic">a giddiness</hi> that she could not remain up: Isabella added an express Postscript to the Dr about it. Dr says it is probably nothing but some &#x201C;indigestion,&#x201C; and makes or affects to make light of it: but I am very anxious for some Letter from Scotsbrig again! None came yesterday; I hope there will be one today.</p>
<p>We are tolerably well in health here; Jane herself, tho&#x2019; a day of <hi rend="italic">frost</hi> incommodes her, has a good average of health; but her spirits are none of the best, in the dark months especially. I sit secluded up here, among Books and Papers, all forenoon; keep for most part very solitary, and <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to advance towards something worthy,&#x2014;at lowest, contrive generally to &#x201C;consume my own smoke,&#x201C; which is something!&#x2014; In this Number of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> is a little Paper of mine with some Letters of Cromwell; which you will rather like to read. My Mother has a Copy (of the Article by itself), if you see it nowhere else.</p>
<p>Last night we had a Letter from Alick; which is now (when you <hi rend="italic">read</hi> this) forward at Scotsbrig. They will send it you doubtless in due course. Alick is busy and they are all well.&#x2014; &#x2014; The Dr is much more <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> here than was usual with him: he stands fiercely up to his <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi>, and I think will really do some good with it, poor fellow.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-22-173" n="22:173"/>How is Jenny? Is her bit <foreign>Bairn</foreign> better, poor little creature? Tell me how you are all getting on, and what news there are among you.</p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle</salute>
<p>We are very thankful to hear you are getting rid of your giddiness; and for my own share I have <hi rend="italic">double</hi> cause to be thankful, for when anything ails his Mother, my Husband is so unhappy that I have <hi rend="italic">two</hi> to feel uneasy about. Jamie says he thinks you <hi rend="italic">read</hi> more than is good for you, and Jamie always knows what he is saying better than most men. &#x201C;In every inordinate cup there is a Devil&#x201C;; so it may easily be that even in the apparently laudible &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">inordinate</hi> cup&#x2019; of <hi rend="italic">reading</hi>, there may be <hi rend="italic">a devil of giddyness</hi>!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> 3.2.</note> So don&#x2019;t like a good woman read at such a wild rate!&#x2014; besides I want you to do something for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> which, if you will undertake, will leave you less time to pore over books. You sent me a pair of stockings by Carlyle which are very warm, and very pretty, but a degree too small&#x2014;especially the legs of them seem to have been knitted for two <hi rend="italic">pot-sticks</hi> rather than for well-shaped, goodly sized woman&#x2019;s-legs like mine. Carlyle told me that Margaret Austin<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James and Mary Austin&#x2019;s eldest da. (b. <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>).</note> knitted them, and I have been thinking to have knit <hi rend="italic">all my</hi> woolen stockings; only from a pattern,&#x2014;with room for a certain amount of <hi rend="italic">calf</hi>,&#x2014;which I could send her (not the calf&#x2014;but the pattern) but if she have not fine soft yarn to make them of, no matter how well they are shaped so I have also been thinking to ask you to spin the yarn for me, and then I should have &#x201C;a perfect <hi rend="italic">article</hi>&#x201C;; as the Shopkeepers here say&#x2014;besides the <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> of the thing&#x2014;there is a sort of dark-coloured lambs wool that one wears without being died, which would suit this abominable City better than white&#x2014;tho I would like some white ones too&#x2014;if I could get them. I am wearing just now a sort of <hi rend="italic">yellow-brown</hi> stockings! that my very kitten stares at in amazement as I walk about the room&#x2014;but I wear them in <pb id="pg-22-174" n="22:174"/>sublime indifference to the kitten&#x2019;s ideas of the becoming, and to everybody else&#x2019;s they are so soft and warm&#x2014;but then they are an &#x201C;extortionful price&#x201C;&#x2014;like all <hi rend="italic">new</hi> things here&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">novelty</hi> being considered the essence of <hi rend="italic">genteelity</hi></p>
<p>We continue all pretty well&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the sickness around is quite sad to hear tell of. So many people dead of influenza and scarlet fever! When I remember last year at this time I cannot be too thankful, that things are as they are so far as our own house is concerned&#x2014; The little servant I got last newyears day has turned out a real godsend&#x2014;so quiet, and orderly, and honest, The house was never so peaceably managed since I was mistress&#x2014; I have not had to transact <hi rend="italic">one</hi> scold since this girl came to me&#x2014; She is an excellent cook, and the only objection I had to her in the beginning&#x2014;a sort of want of <hi rend="italic">enthusiasm</hi> for things in general and <hi rend="italic">my</hi> work in particular has gradually disappeared&#x2014; She seems now quite as much interested in us as Helen<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell, the Carlyles&#x2019; maid from <date when="1837-12-00">Dec. 1837</date> to <date when="1846-11-00">Nov. 1846</date>, when she left to keep house in Dublin for her brother John.

<p>We are all in mud here still, but perhaps you will enlighten us a little. I have no means to write more, and indeed was partly bound, but for the accident (good luck to it!) not to write at all.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We are very sorry to find your trouble still continues, tho&#x2019; now in a less degree. It is a sad thought to me in the mornings: My poor Mother is lying confined, unable to walk, at this time! But we must not be impatient: we have had much <hi rend="italic">health</hi> among us; and often has <hi rend="italic">good</hi> news come to us from Scotsbrig on your behalf: let us be patient, let us be grateful. Jack still persists in imputing your illness to mere common derangements of the stomach, by sitting too long over your Books &#x26;c; and assures us we shall have you in your usual way again shortly: let us hope that it will be even so. Isabella is very good in writing to us.&#x2014; I suppose this business must be part <pb id="pg-22-176" n="22:176"/>of the general ill-health that is over all the country at present. In London, and from all quarters, within seas and beyond, we hear of nothing but <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi> and other bodily ailments: there never was, they say, as much sickness in London;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1847-12-11">11 Dec.</date>, noted: &#x201C;The excessive moisture of the autumn, and its remarkable variations in temperature, have &#x2026; been accompanied by an immense increase on the average mortality of Great Britain. Thus, it being very possible that we may again be subjected to &#x2026; [cholera], there is good reason for the exercise of foresight and precaution &#x2026; . The most fatal diseases at present prevailing are breast complaints and bronchitis.&#x201C; It also noted &#x201C;Great Mortality in London,&#x201C; a &#x201C;startling increase in the number of deaths&#x201C; mainly from respiratory diseases.</note> at Chelsea too, many persons are ill, young and old laid hold of by distempers of one kind or other. In our house here, unlike many of our acquaintance, we have escaped altogether as yet.</p>
<p>With regard to the stockings and spinning, Jane bids me tell you that it is &#x201C;mere nothing&#x201C;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471206-JWC-MAC-01">JWC to MAC, [<date when="1847-12-06">6? Dec.</date>]</ref>.</note> you are not, any of you, to make the smallest bustle about the affair, concerning which there is no hurry at all: only when some right <hi rend="italic">wool</hi> does turn up, and our dear old Mother is in a case for spinning again, Jane will be very proud to wear a pair of stockings or two of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> manufacture. That is really all:&#x2014;and we will hope to see its accomplishment yet in good time.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> are at Dumfries, I suppose; getting bound for you. The <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi> is now out too; but I think you are all provided with that. I have got part of the payment for these two Books; &#xa3;250; and &#xa3;350, I believe, will be paid before long: so that I am pretty well in funds at present,&#x2014;not chased about, as I used to be, by the haggard shad<supplied>[ow]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> of Beggary; which is a great relief to me, now when I am growing old! I am very thankful for my poverty; and for my deliverance from it in good time.&#x2014; They have also paid me for the Cromwell Paper in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> &#xa3;17 and odds. Which is all right, in its way.</p>
<p>Tell Jamie, as to the <hi rend="italic">Satter</hi>, I do not see any likelihood for me there at present: of course if they sell Cushathill and it <hi rend="italic">together</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Satur Mill and an adjoining property to the E.</note> that is final; moreover the <hi rend="italic">price</hi> is beyond my present capabilities. However, let him keep his eye on the thing; and if there do seem any chance, we will not neglect it.</p>
<p>Here is a Letter from good Thomas Erskine, just come; you may read it, and then burn it: a good man; whose word it does one good to hear now and then.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jack was with us yesterday, as he often is; very busy, very brisk and well. Our weather is unusually <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> and bright for the season; often moist, too, and indeed Jane has gone out to enjoy the sunshine; and so will I.&#x2014; &#x2014; Keep yourself <hi rend="italic">still</hi>, dear Mother; and let us hear soon, if it bless <pb id="pg-22-177" n="22:177"/>Heaven, that you are fairly on foot again! <closer><salute>My blessing with you, dear Mother; and with one and all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>This Third Edition of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> does not differ, in any particular affecting <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>, from the Second,&#x2014;for which, as I think you will recal to mind, your permission, in the time of Fraser and of the reprinting of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, was sought and obtained.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391227-TC-WT-01"><sic>11:233</sic><corr>TC to WT, <date when="1839-12-27">27 Dec. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I have not yet been at the bottom of certain boxes of old dusty Papers, to fish up our original Agreement about <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>: but you are aware of my fixed persuasion as to the <hi rend="italic">Copyright</hi> of that work,&#x2014;which I believe, in the absence of other evidence the Titlepage itself indicates, in the eye of Law;&#x2014;you are aware too of the extremely insignificant nature of the property <pb id="pg-22-178" n="22:178"/>in question;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450624-TC-WT-01"><sic>19:85</sic><corr>TC to WT, <date when="1845-06-24">24 June 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> and how I hitherto have been well content that it should lie as a poor barren undefined <hi rend="italic">Common</hi> between us, each of us cutting &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">divots</hi>&#x201C; from it at discretion, and peace and good-fellowship (to me, for one) being much more valuable than any &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">divots</hi>&#x201C; to be got or lost there!</p>
<p>Allow me therefore to hope that, till you find your Copy of the Agreement or I find mine, and while my designation stands upon the Titlepage, and my recollection as to the terms of bargain are what they are,&#x2014;you will not bring me into Chancery, or force me to bring you there, for such a cause! To which hope, if it be needful, I add my special request, and appeal in the name of old days, which are dear to me even because they are old.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And so, wishing you always well, and delivered from botherations, now that you are free of business,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Letter; which was very welcome to us indeed. The <hi rend="italic">ink</hi> was extremely faint; and the morning-light yesterday (as today) was very <foreign><hi rend="italic">drumly</hi></foreign> [gloomy] and gray: however, by standing with my back to the windows, I made out the writing, and read it, while Jane manufactured the tea,&#x2014;with hearty satisfaction. Our good old Mother! The image of her, sitting in her little end-room reading <hi rend="italic">Cowper</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Cowper (<date when="1731-00-00">1731</date>&#x2013;<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>).</note> a little speck of light in the great dead heart of Universal Winter, is infinitely interesting to us! Thanks for all your details about her. She is evidently very frail,&#x2014;as she may well be,&#x2014;and ought to take every care of herself, and to be tended (as I think she is, thanks to Isabella&#x2019;s goodness) with all care:&#x2014;me you would do an especial favour if, with your clear eyes, you could discern anything, I, so far off, and possessed of nothing but <hi rend="italic">money</hi>, could get for her; any service whatever that I could do her. My continual love she knows, at any rate; my thankfulness to the All-Merciful that still spares her for a head to us. In the world I have not any dearer possession.&#x2014; If she will be very <hi rend="italic">canny</hi> till this bad season go, and the Sun come out again, I shall be much obliged to her! The weather must certainly be very unwholesome somehow; there never was as much sickliness, in all corners of the world, that I remember: not all <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi>, I believe; for everybody falls ill, and everybody labels his disease <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi>, whatever the real ailment be. We have almost <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> the <pb id="pg-22-179" n="22:179"/>usual number of deaths weekly in London, for some time past. But, they tell me, it is abating now; and I believe, if good hard frost would come, of which there are some symptoms occasionally, the distempered state of things would alter for the better.</p>
<p>Thanks for your attention in the matter of the Books: if you will send me the <hi rend="italic">Account</hi>, it will now be all right. I do not yet very well know what the <hi rend="italic">eligiblest</hi> conveyance to Annandale is, indeed it is perhaps not yet <hi rend="italic">settled</hi>, while there are so many changes; but I am glad to know Dumfries <hi rend="italic">subsists</hi>, and we may continue that method till a better turn up. I think I will keep a <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi> also for my Mother; as it is decidedly better printed, this time, and has an <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> over and above. I will also send one to your James, that he may <hi rend="italic">bind</hi> it and have the thing in such <hi rend="italic">order</hi> as he likes. The two Copies will come, I hope, about New-Years-day: My Mother&#x2019;s to be <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> as before,&#x2014;I suppose, in the exact style of <hi rend="italic">the Miscellanies</hi>, if that is approved of. And so that is settled too.</p>
<p>We are in fair health here; wonderful, considering the general average. Jane is a little shivery when the cold winds begin; but she never fairly gives in, and indeed I think is in tolerable case. We are all, we London people, in the very heart of Christmas goose-eating, you in Scotland never dreamt of such a time as the London Christmas is: huge <hi rend="italic">walls</hi> of slain sheep and beeves; all railroads groaning with fat turkies, capons, hares, the whole world intent seemingly on one thing, that of being filled with excellent victual and liquors:&#x2014;&#x201C;wae&#x2019;s t&#x2019;em wi&#x2019; their bags [woe to the wealthy]!&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420906-JWC-JW-01"><sic>15:72</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-09-06">6 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> With all which, however, there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> &#x201C;London people,&#x201C; a dyspeptic two, that do not in the least concern themselves: these two are to dine, this Christmas day, upon I know not what,&#x2014;perhaps <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, except some small pudding of ground rice or the like! The dark weather, and the turn of the year make me always <hi rend="italic">serious</hi>, if nothing else would; and I never could <hi rend="italic">rejoice</hi> very heartily at Newyearsday, not when I was much younger and merrier than now.&#x2014; We have got to decide, in these days, about going down into Hampshire again, where the people want a new visit from us. <hi rend="italic">Grand</hi> enough people, and very kind, both the elder Ashburton Lordships and the younger; they want us &#x201C;from the <date when="1848-01-07">7<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of Jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date> to the <date when="1848-02-15">15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of February</date>,&#x201C;&#x2014;which, in so idle an element, seems much too long a time. Nay, there is one of us that would about as soon be off altogether,&#x2014;so perverse is the matter, with its fashionable idleness, its &#x26;c &#x26;c! But I suppose we shall have to go, for a shorter or a longer time: kind souls, of any rank, especially of that rank, ought to have their kindness recognised, by the like of us.</p>
<p>No <hi rend="italic">work</hi> is yet lying <hi rend="italic">disengaged on the stithy</hi>, with a hammer in one&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-22-180" n="22:180"/>hand freely smiting at it! Work, I do imagine, goes on; but, alas, I think it may be a long while yet before much of it get fairly to the <hi rend="italic">stithy</hi>,&#x2014;for the nature of it is indeed a little abstruse. Nothing hurries me from without; nothing. I have grown absolutely to care not one penny about all the &#x201C;fame&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c that such a generation as the present could give me or withhold from me,&#x2014;indeed, from any generation of Adam&#x2019;s Posterity, it seems a mighty small matter to me;&#x2014;and for the rest, I have money to buy meal and broadcloth with; and I do not know what else particularly &#x201C;the world&#x201C; has in it that could be superlatively useful to me! Really one feels, with one&#x2019;s head getting grey, and one&#x2019;s heart long tempered in the Stygian waters, very <hi rend="italic">independent</hi> indeed; and quite as a kind of secret <hi rend="italic">emperor</hi> among these beggarly populations, all hunting like ravens, all <hi rend="italic">hungry</hi> as ravens, tho&#x2019; with <hi rend="italic">heaps</hi> of ill-smelling carrion already piled round them!&#x2014; So let us be quiet;&#x2014;let us be pious-minded, and listen to the Silences, to the &#x201C;small still voices,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Kings 19:12.</note> ourselves silent.&#x2014; &#x2014; I know not if you read that Paper in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>; or have heard that there is a kind of audible bustle about it, in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> and other such barren regions here; many long-eared persons insinuating, or saying openly, that I have been <hi rend="italic">hoaxed</hi> in the matter.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1847-12-11">11 Dec.</date>, declared: &#x201C;The December number of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> contains as pretty a matter for controversy among the antiquarians as we recollect to have encountered. &#x2026; These copies [of the putative Cromwell letters] Mr. Carlyle has no hesitation, it seems, in pronouncing genuine. He gives to them the valuable sanction of his <hi rend="italic">imprimatur</hi> &#x2026; . It remains to be seen how far he may be able to communicate his own implicit faith to the world of historical readers, students and searchers.&#x201C; On <date when="1847-12-18">18 Dec.</date>, the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> noted that there had been a good deal of discussion about the authenticity of the letters and quoted a correspondent&#x2019;s letter showing &#x201C;the suspicion which attaches to them and the scrutiny to which they are exposed in more than one quarter.&#x2014;&#x2018;Surely the world of novel readers may expect a second De Foe whenever the author of the &#x201C;Cromwell Letters&#x201C; vouched for by Mr. Carlyle shall venture on the commission of a romance. A yet closer attention to <hi rend="italic">colour</hi> and <hi rend="italic">costume</hi> may, however, be advantageously superadded. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I stand no nonsense</hi> from any man&#x201C; &#x201C;won&#x2019;t wash&#x201C; as a saying of the Brewer&#x2019;s Son:&#x2014;and the escape of <hi rend="italic">Miss</hi> Andrews from the nunnery is an anachronism not to be overlooked.&#x2019;&#x201C; TC had received a letter dated <date when="1847-12-19">19 Dec.</date> from John Bruce, of Hyde House, nr.

Will o&#x2019; th&#x2019; Whisp.&#x201C; TC seems to have replied, <date when="1847-12-20">20 Dec.</date>, sending Bruce a letter from Edward FitzGerald (probably of <date when="1847-06-29">29 June</date>) and a sample of transcriptions of the letters; for on <date when="1847-12-21">21 Dec.</date>, Bruce wrote to TC that he was returning &#x201C;Mr Fitzgerald&#x2019;s letter &#x26; also the sheet of transcriptions&#x201C; and that &#x201C;no human being shall ever be the wiser upon the enunciated [?] points of the history of the 35 [letters] through me.&#x201C; Further, said Bruce, &#x201C;I thank you for intrusting me with the inclosed, because it is a proof of your good will towards me, and I willingly pledge myself most solemnly to all the stipulations you have imposed upon me.&#x201C; On <date when="1847-12-22">22 Dec.</date>, Bruce wrote acknowledging receipt of further transcriptions and promising to compare them with the printed copies as soon as possible. &#x201C;I had not seen,&#x201C; he said, &#x201C;the Athenaeum for last Sat. [<date when="1847-12-18">18 Dec.</date>] when I first wrote to you &#x26; had overlooked what was said in the previous no. &#x2026; Of course neither they nor I nor any one supposes that you had any thing to do in any deception (if any such there has been): such an idea, I am persuaded, never entered any body&#x2019;s mind; but, I confess to you, that, for very many reasons which I will detail to you in a few days, I cannot divest myself (at present) of the impression that there is enough in the letters themselves, as printed, to throw doubt upon their genuineness.&#x201C; John Bruce (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3740"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451123-TC-JAC-01"><sic>20:60&#x2013;61</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1845-11-23">23 Nov. 1845</date></corr></ref>), antiquary; one of the founders of the Camden Society; ed. of many vols. of historical papers, mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth cents.<lb/><lb/>
TC received other letters relative to the Squire papers, probably few of which survive. A person signing himself only &#x201C;H B.&#x201C; wrote from Beccles, <date when="1847-12-07">7 Dec.</date>, to say that &#x201C;Cosey (?)&#x201C; in letter no. 15 was Costessey in Norfolk, &#x201C;still always pronounced Cos&#x2019;ey.&#x201C; J. W. Hodge wrote, <date when="1847-12-20">20 Dec.</date>, from 12 Buckingham St., London, to offer the same answer about &#x201C;Cosey&#x201C; and to note that &#x201C;Bullards (?) at Stamford&#x201C; in letter no. 4 should be &#x201C;Bullwards, Stamford being famous for bull baiting.&#x201C; TC notes these corrections in the <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date> reprint; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:358n, 351n.</note> To all which I answer, and shall answer, nothing:&#x2014;only, if it go too <pb id="pg-22-181" n="22:181"/>far, I think of sending my &#x201C;Unknown Correspondent&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As William Squire was called in the article.</note> in person up to the people (who is a terrible tower of a fellow, true as heart-of-oak, and half-mud); he, stamping a huge cudgel on the floor, might chance to settle the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">hoax</hi>&#x201C;-argument in a very sudden and unexpected manner!&#x2014; &#x2014; Poor Mrs Howitson!

<p>Only thanks today; and a word about the Books. Croucher&#x2019;s two men, the week you went to Normanscourt, <hi rend="italic">shewed</hi> me the <hi rend="italic">Moise</hi> on its way to Stanhope Street, and engaged, almost with oaths, that the <hi rend="italic">Christ</hi> should infallibly follow it next day.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Croucher&#x201C; is a name for J. G. Cochrane of the London Library. Norman Court is 7 mi. E of Salisbury. <hi rend="italic">Moise</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Christ</hi> are unidentified.</note> Whereupon I <hi rend="italic">took</hi> their oath for a prediction of the fact. To my horror, I discover yesterday, clearly for the first time, that the Book has never gone. <hi rend="italic">Rowe</hi> for Croucher, in consequence, and for Croucher&#x2019;s men; immense search of registers, of shelves; embarrassed hurlyburly; ending with desperate doubt on the part of Croucher, whether the Book, tho&#x2019; printed in his Catalogue and sworn to as above, was ever actually extant in his Collection at all,&#x2014;or other than a Shadow in the fields of Hope,&#x2014;much less, <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> to you, as sworn! Poor old man, when &#x201C;soft sauwder [flattery]&#x201C; will not serve, <hi rend="italic">which</hi> he has ready in any quantity, he rocks in his list-shoes, and is ill-bested. As to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xc9;tat actuel</hi></foreign> [actual fact], neither he nor any Bookseller I can yet consult, has heard of such a Book: but I <hi rend="italic">persist</hi> in my assertion: on Tuesday next, I am to have evidence <hi rend="italic">contra</hi>, or else <hi rend="italic">pro</hi>, and in that case perhaps the Book itself; which shall be taken care of. On Tuesday, <hi rend="italic">Christ</hi> too is promised me.

It is a Book of no <hi rend="italic">use</hi>, if you even had it.&#x2014; And so let the <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> account close for today.</p>
<p>A much more important business, that of the visit to Alverstoke, hangs on the balance here, trembling till Monday! My Wife is decidedly weakly; I too, for the last fortnight, am much below par (tho&#x2019; recovering now); the late hours and big rooms of The Grange rather frighten the weak female nerves;&#x2014;and to me myself &#x201C;the 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of February&#x201C; seems a date beyond <pb id="pg-22-183" n="22:183"/>what I can claim, in these abstruse conditions!

Only in things real and serious can poor I ever be anything to you. Think of that, for it is true.

<salute>Dear Redwood,</salute>
<p>We duly received, on Christmas Evening, your annual Bounty; excellent as ever; silent, friendly, and acceptable as ever. Many thanks to you; and kind wishes, such as beseem the season, none anywhere sincerer. May the worst of our days be past;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311204-TC-AC-01"><sic>6:63</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1831-12-04">4 Dec. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> may some good days for us still be coming!</p>
<p>I have sent by the Bookseller a Copy of the <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi>,&#x2014;a new edition which they have just got out: it contains an <hi rend="italic">Index</hi>, and is better <pb id="pg-22-184" n="22:184"/>printed than the others: set it on your shelves, as a small useless memorial of me,&#x2014;silent, which will not bother you unless you bother it.&#x2014; I am busy with nothing new in the <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi> way; in the way of silence, not yet come to speech, if they ever come, many things more or less busy me. The harvest is great, and the labourers are few.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 9:37.</note></p>
<p>In spite of Influenzas, we have hitherto escaped wonderfully well here; in some ten days, we go into Hampshire, to some friends, for a week or two; at the beginning of February we return, and then abide.&#x2014; Did you see in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> for <date when="1847-12-00">Dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date> certain new Letters of Oliver? They will rather interest you, in proportion to their bulk,&#x2014;being indeed small in that latter particular.</p>
<p>We hope you feel yourself <hi rend="italic">adjusted</hi> at Boverton; and doing, in a calm and customary manner, daily the day&#x2019;s journey. Is there no chance of seeing you here shortly? My Wife says, there is a room for you at Chelsea when you please to come.</p>
<p>We had the American Emerson lately with us: he is still somewhere in the Yorkshire regions, lecturing to Mechanics Institutes. A man of elevated views;&#x2014;elevated, but airy, idle; made of <hi rend="italic">moonshine</hi> mostly, alas! To a man intent on <hi rend="italic">work</hi> as his one duty, such idle wire-drawing, and weaving of Gymnosophist cobwebs,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gymnosophists were ancient Hindu philosophers (contemporary with the ancient Greeks) given to mystical contemplation.</note> is worse than afflicting! America, I begin to find everywhere, is a Country given up to the Torpors, to the Cants; as good as <hi rend="italic">vacant</hi> for me. Dollars abound, and drawling religious or quasi-religious Twaddle; but these I want not.</p>

<salute>Royal Highness,</salute>
<p>I have, this day, had the honour to receive from Weimar a very kind Note, enclosing an Autograph of Goethe;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The letter (only an undated draft of which is extant) said: &#x201C;We live in the past as well as the present&#x2014;but we chiefly choose the former, when interesting circumstances concur to make it dear to us. You will consider it natural, therefore, that I often find myself living over again that precious hour I had the happiness to spend with you, when I was last in England. You, who are doubtless as much attached to your country as I am to mine, will readily conceive the pleasure it gave me to hear a man like you speak in the highest terms of names, which I had been accustomed to revere and admire above all others&#x2014;names, which I am happy to esteem as the pride and the boast of my blood. The sympathy I had before felt for you seemed at once explained and justified,&#x2014;and (let me add) cemented from that moment. In token of this, and in memorial of that interesting hour, I beg your acceptance of the accompanying hand-writing of Goethe. May it keep the remembrance of Weimar Still alive in your heart, and may you sometimes think of one who will always be / Very sincerely yours.&#x201C;.</note> for which permit me to return my thankful acknowledgement. Autographs of Goethe I already had; but one sent to me in this manner I may justly treasure among my valuables and memorables.</p>
<p>The Visit your Royal Highness was pleased to honour me with, still lives, with all vividness, in my remembrance, as it may naturally do. Apart from other considerations, to see face to face, in my pilgrimage thro&#x2019; this world, the Descendent of Friedrich the Wise and of Karl August,&#x2014;of Luther&#x2019;s Protector in the era of the Reformation, and of Goethe&#x2019;s in the era of the Sansculottes,&#x2014;could not be other than interesting. Not many royal men can achieve such acts as these were, in the World&#x2019;s History; fewer and fewer royal men, as the Ages grow ever more dilapidated, bewildered and <hi rend="italic">un</hi>heroic. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Blasen ist nicht Fl&#xF6;ten</hi></foreign>, To blow is not to play on the flute,&#x201C; says Goethe in this Autograph: no; and, alas, the most, in our days, cannot even &#x201C;blow&#x201C;!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If your Royal Highness be pleased to retain some benevolence for me, surely I shall feel much honoured. Might I be permitted also to commend <pb id="pg-22-186" n="22:186"/>myself, with humble respects, to a High Lady, whom I was once near seeing, but (in the evil time) did not see; in whom, if all testimony lie not, I might have reverenced a still noble Daughter of the Old Heroes.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sophie Louise, m., <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; da. of William II (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>) of the Netherlands, who fought in Spain under Wellington and commanded the Dutch forces at Waterloo.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Emerson seems to be wandering much about the North Country; but his central address, I find, is &#x201C;2. Fenny Street, Higher Broughton, Manchester&#x201C;: I have a Note from him this morning,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1847-12-28">28 Dec.</date></note> almost the first since we parted here directly after his arrival in England; and he continues to date from that locality. What his &#x201C;success&#x201C; &#x26;c is, I have never heard except from the vague babble of foolish or careless persons,&#x2014;which, as the Jacobin said, it may be interesting <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to remember.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410902-TC-JWC-01"><sic>13:240</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1841-09-02">2 Sept. 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> Pray see Emerson; you will find him a noteworthy man,&#x2014;very exotic, tho&#x2019; of English blood: much &#x201C;at his ease in Zion,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Amos 6:1.</note> too; which perhaps may be a recommendation more, to the like of you.</p>
<p>We do hope to see you on the 12<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, then; and to work some good speech out of you, in spite of your nonsense.&#x2014; Why do you say, I should like Spain and its Anarchies?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes had gone to Portugal in early <date when="1847-09-00">Sept.</date> and to Spain, late <date when="1847-09-00">Sept.</date> to <date when="1847-11-00">Nov.</date> He was to see TC at Bay House, in <date when="1848-01-00">Jan.</date></note> Anarchy, and all ruin, of greasy begging friars, or other such lost cattle, is utterly hateful to me: but putrid Superstitions, damnable by God and detestable to men, must be cleared away out of this Creation;&#x2014;and it is no wonder the <hi rend="italic">Scavengering</hi> makes a pretty mess at times! As for me, I had rather save my boots and <hi rend="italic">nose</hi>, and be out of all that, till it be abated somewhat.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi>, and the Stock-Exchanges thank you for your Jew Bill.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A debate on the govt. measure for the removal of all civil disabilities from Jews and allowing them to sit as M.P.s took place, <date when="1847-12-16">16</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-12-17">17 Dec.</date> Milnes returned on purpose to vote for the introduction of a bill. This was the Commons&#x2019; sixth attempt to overturn the requirement of an oath by new M.P.s &#x201C;on the true faith of a Christian,&#x201C; occasioned by the election of Lionel Nathan de Rothschild (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24160"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) for the City of London in <date when="1847-08-00">Aug.</date> The bill had its first reading, <date when="1847-12-20">20 Dec.</date>, and passed in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> but was rejected by Lords, <date when="1849-06-00">June 1849</date>. Jews were not admitted to the Commons until <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date> and to Lords until <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>. Milnes was now a liberal.</note> I think I <pb id="pg-22-187" n="22:187"/>should be idler than I ever expect to be as Lawgiver of this country, if I spent any moment of my time in passing bills to admit men into my Parliament who, by the very fact of their desiring admission, declare themselves to be hypocritical man! A Jew is bad; but what is a Sham-Jew, a Quack-Jew? And how can a real Jew, by possibility, try to be Senator, or even Citizen, of any Country, except his own wretched Palestine, whither all his thoughts and steps and efforts tend,&#x2014;where, in the Devil&#x2019;s name, let him arrive as soon as possible, and make us quit of him!</p>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>We are very glad to see your handwriting again,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a letter from Manchester, <date when="1847-12-28">28 Dec.</date></note> and learn that you are well, and doing well. Our news of you hitherto, from the dim Lecture-element, had been satisfactory indeed, but vague. Go on, and prosper.</p>
<p>I do not much think Miss Fuller would do any great good with the Pepoli&#x2019;s,&#x2014;even if they are still in Rome, and not at Bologna as our advices here seemed to indicate.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote that Margaret Fuller had requested him to ask the Carlyles whether the Pepolis, &#x201C;in Rome for the winter,&#x201C; would be &#x201C;good for her to know.&#x201C;.</note> Madam Pepoli is an elderly Scotch Lady, of excellent commonplace vernacular qualities, hardly of more; the Count, some years younger, and a much airier man, is on all sides a beautiful <hi rend="italic">Dilettante</hi>,&#x2014;little suitable, I fear, to the serious mind that can recognise him as such! However, if the people are still in Rome, Miss F. can easily try: Bid Miss F. present my Wife&#x2019;s compliments, or mine, or even <hi rend="italic">yours</hi> (for they know all our domesticities here, and are very intimate, especially Madam with <hi rend="italic">My</hi> Dame); upon which the acquaintance is at once made, and can be continued if useful.</p>
<p>This morning, Richard Milnes writes to me for your Address; which I have sent. He is just returned out of Spain; home swiftly to &#x201C;vote for the Jew Bill&#x201C;; is doing hospitalities at Woburn Abbey;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seat of the duke of Bedford and one of the great strongholds of the Whigs.</note> and I suppose will be in Yorkshire (home, near Pontefract) before long. See him, if you have opportunity: <pb id="pg-22-188" n="22:188"/>a man very easy to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> and get into flowing talk with; a man of much sharpness of faculty, well tempered by several inches of &#x201C;Christian <hi rend="italic">fat</hi>&#x201C; he has upon his ribs for covering. One of the idlest, cheeriest, most gifted of fat little men.</p>
<p>Tennyson has been here for three weeks; dining daily till he is near dead;&#x2014;setting out a Poem withal.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Princess</hi>. Tennyson wrote to Edward FitzGerald in late <date when="1847-12-00">Dec.</date> that he had &#x201C;seen Carlyle more than once&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Letters of Tennyson</hi>, ed. C. Lang and E. Shannon [Cambridge, Mass., <date when="1980-00-00">1980</date>] 1:281).</note> He came in to us on Sunday evening last, and on the preceding Sunday: a truly interesting Son of Earth, and Son of Heaven,&#x2014;who has almost lost his way, among the will-o&#x2019;wisps, I doubt; and may flounder ever deeper, over neck and nose at last, among the quagmires that abound! I like him well; but can do next to nothing for him. Milnes, with general cooperation, got him a Pension; and he has bread and tobacco: but that is a poor outfit for such a soul. He wants a <hi rend="italic">task</hi>; and, alas, that of spinning rhymes, and naming it &#x201C;Art&#x201C; and &#x201C;high Art,&#x201C; in a Time like ours, will never furnish him.</p>
<p>For myself I have been entirely <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>,&#x2014;I dare not even say, too abstrusely <hi rend="italic">occupied</hi>; for I have merely been <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> at the Chaos even, not by any means working in it. I have not even read a Book,&#x2014;that I liked. All &#x201C;Literature&#x201C; has grown inexpressibly unsatisfactory to me. Better be silent than talk farther in this mood.</p>
<p>We are going off, on Saturday come a week, into Hampshire, to certain Friends you have heard me speak of. Our Address, till the beginning of February, is, &#x201C;Hon. W. B. Baring / Alverstoke / Gosport / Hants.&#x201C;&#x2014; <closer><salute>My Wife sends you many kind regards; remember us across the Ocean too;&#x2014;and be well and busy till we meet / Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am afraid there is no <hi rend="italic">good</hi> German-English Dictionary; certainly at <pb id="pg-22-189" n="22:189"/>least I do not, and never did, possess one such. If you decide on having the best attainable by moderate means, I believe (but only by hearsay) it is one published by Whitaker here a few years ago; the work of a German, whose name I think is Fl&#xfc;gel, but revised by an Englishman called Oxenden or Oxneford:&#x2014;the name of <hi rend="italic">Whitaker</hi> the Publisher will it<supplied>[self]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> direct you to the object, thro&#x2019; any Bookseller; the cost of the Work may, I suppose, be some 20 or 25 shillings,&#x2014;but it will be safest to inquire first.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Gottfried Fl&#xfc;gel, <hi rend="italic">Fl&#xfc;gel&#x2019;s Complete Dictionary of the German and English Languages, Adapted to the English Student by C. A. Feiling and A. Heimann</hi>, pbd. by Whitaker Dulau, and D. Nutt (<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>); vol. 2 by Dr. J. Sporschil. In the pref. (v) they mention their debt, especially in the first part, to John Oxenford (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">77</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21055"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), dramatist and trans. from German.</note> Adelung&#x2019;s big Dictionary, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> German (like our <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>), and in several volumes, is the only one to be recommended as quite effectual for an interpretation of that language, when once you have made some way in it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Christoph Adelung, <hi rend="italic">Versuch eines V&#xF6;llstandigen Grammatisch-Kritischen W&#xF6;rterbuchs der Hochdeutschen Mundart</hi>, 5 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1786-00-00">86</date>).</note></p>
<p>On the whole, if I might advise you from my own experience, I should say, Be content with any Dictionary; <hi rend="italic">read</hi> Books; diligently, carefully,&#x2014;with a determination to know, by guessing and divination if no otherwise, accurately what it is that the Author means. If you read good Authors, Lessing, Schiller, Goethe and the like, you will find this same &#x201C;divination&#x201C; of their meaning a process otherwise highly useful; and insensibly, while thus intent on higher objects you will learn with exactness the import of words, and find yourself able to read German as no Dictionary could teach you to do. The grand thing is to <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, industriously with daily constancy, with rigorous fidelity:&#x2014;and as to choice of Books, the best rule is, Please your own real taste so far as you can; read the Book you at heart want to read, if it be attainable; or if it be not, then the next in degree that is. And in short, be constant, keep moving forward. A man that will advance <hi rend="italic">steadfastly</hi>, even by a very bad road, will get thro&#x2019; far worse imbroglios than the German Language; provided, I say, he <hi rend="italic">advance</hi> in one direction, and do not take to turning back, or helplessly groping round and round, in search of new better directions.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Bidding you good speed in this and all faithful endeavour</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Yours very sincerely /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I rather suspect John is writing to you; but today is the last day of the Year, and the last too for your American Packet, so I will not let it pass without at least one word from me. A word of heartfelt good-wishes, and prayers for a &#x201C;Good New year&#x201C; to you,&#x2014;prayers which indeed we can do little to <hi rend="italic">fulfil</hi>, but cannot avoid forming in our hearts. They can do no <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>; <pb id="pg-22-191" n="22:191"/>and they abide with us naturally while we continue, however far asunder, in this world! As poor Edward Irving used to say, &#x201C;May the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of our days be past,&#x201C;&#x2014;which indeed I hope and believe they really are.</p>
<p>Last time I wrote to you, or one of the last times, was from Scotsbrig. Since that, I have had your Letter, which was eagerly expected here, and was welcome especially to our Mother as you may believe. I sent it forward without loss of a moment.&#x2014; Our dear old Mother, as Jack will probably tell you, has had a kind of ill-turn lately; it <supplied>[was]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> a sudden feeling of <hi rend="italic">giddiness</hi> lasting for several days, which very much alarmed <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, tho&#x2019; Jack said always, it was probably nothing but derangement in the stomach,&#x2014;as indeed it proved; for they write us now, for some weeks past, that it is as good as gone again, and that if the <hi rend="italic">weather</hi> were kindlier, all would be in its old state, or nearly so. They are very kind and attentive to our Mother, Isabella and Jamie, as I believe; she eats with them (as Jamie was suggesting, before I left, that she ought); they kindle her fire &#x26;c: Jean too was out from Dumfries about a week ago, and wrote to us satisfactorily while there.&#x2014; This, I think, is all the news, dear Brother; this little touch of <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> news,&#x2014;which, however, we ought to rejoice is no <hi rend="italic">worse</hi>.</p>
<p>Indeed there hardly ever was, in man&#x2019;s memory, such an unhealthy year as this hitherto has been; for several weeks the deaths in London have been above 2&#xBD; times what they commonly are; and it is the same story in all parts of the Country, and even on the Continent far and wide: a kind of <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi>, they call it, which cuts off all manner of old or already weakly people. Happily it is now said to be very considerably abating: if once we had <hi rend="italic">good blackfrost</hi>, it would probably altogether disappear;&#x2014;but we can get no frost yet, and must just wait patiently. I suppose you have plenty of it.</p>
<p>The Irish too, as you see by the Newspapers, are <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than ever; busy murdering and shooting, this year: and in England here there have been continued failures, &#x201C;Commercial pressure&#x201C; &#x26;c, and on the whole more than usual distress among the working classes, and indeed almost all classes, of the people.&#x2014; We in our small circle have much reason for thankfulness, that we have mercifully been spared from all these common calamities.</p>
<p>Dear Brother, here has a visitor come in: I have set him to read till I finish;&#x2014;but it is evidently impossible to go on with any effect, in these circumstances. Not to say that the daylight is just about departing (in this dismal damp fog we have), and, a little after 3, I must send for a candle if I wish to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> any longer. Let me end, therefore, for the present: I will write again soon by a new opportunity. Jane is gone out; cannot join with me in <pb id="pg-22-192" n="22:192"/>word as she does in heart,&#x2014;in blessings to one and all of you,&#x2014;from the poor little Baby<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Carlyle (<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1935-00-00">1935</date>), Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s second da. of this name, the first having d. as an infant, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date> (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350501-TC-AC-01"><sic>8:107</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1835-05-01">1 May 1835</date></corr></ref>); m., Edward Marrs (d. <date when="1927-00-00">1927</date>) of Okmulgee, Oklahoma.</note> (now got well again, but very ill-natured) up to Jenny and yourself the heads of the House. Good be with you, dear Brother;&#x2014;a valiant heart and a wise be always with you,&#x2014;that <hi rend="italic">brings</hi> blessings to every House where it inhabits.&#x2014; Remember us also expressly to Tom and Jane; these two I can always recollect as well as any of you,&#x2014;but the others grow dim and small, when I try to specify them in my imagination. <closer><salute>May they all grow brave lads and bonny honest lasses yet!

The unnamed sec. had received &#x201C;encouraging letters&#x201C; from TC and Anthony Ashley Cooper (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6210"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Lord Ashley (see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430731-JWC-TC-01"><sic>16:330</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-07-31">31 July 1843</date></corr></ref>), who for more than forty years was to be pres. of the Ragged School Union. He had also heard from William Watson (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>), sheriff-substitute of Aberdeenshire, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">66</date>, well-known for his interest in the condition of the poor, having opened the first &#x201C;industrial school&#x201C; for poor boys, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, and poor girls, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, and encouraged similar work elsewhere in Scotland and England.

<p><salute>Dear Sir,&#x2014;</salute>I readily contribute my mite to your Samaritan project, and wish it good speed with my whole heart. In your locality I believe it is much called for, as indeed in most other localities, in these miserable times.</p>
<p>Ragged schools are not known to me, except by public rumour, nor that scheme of <hi rend="italic">visiting</hi> which you propose; but the very definition is a recommendation for such attempts, and awakens in every bystander the wish to see them everywhere faithfully tried. For it is very certain man can teach <pb id="pg-22-193" n="22:193"/>and guide another; men possessed of some knowledge and virtue can impart thereof to others possessing less or none. And if they never come in contact, in practical constant communication with one another, they cannot even have a chance to accomplish this, which is the summary of all social duties, everlastingly binding, whether it be done or not; and the greatest benefit, properly the one benefit, that man can do to man in our world.</p>
<p>Ragged schools, with a good effectual schoolmaster, who did not stand by his horn-books, and slates, and copy&#x2014;books alone, but could frankly lay open a wise, hearty, healthy, human soul to ignorant, dirty, encumbered little human souls&#x2014;such an arrangement I could fancy to be the most excellent of all devices for your object. And as to that of <hi rend="italic">visiting</hi>, I well remember reading Dr. Chalmers&#x2019; development of that scheme,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470220-TC-TCH-01"><sic>21:165</sic><corr>TC to TCH, <date when="1847-02-20">20 Feb. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> as practised by him in Edinburgh, and feeling that it was full of really practical sense&#x2014;that if there was any plan of getting the work done, this, beyond all others, was it. May you prosper well: attract whatever is modest, and willing, and effective, round you to co-operate; and see, if slowly, yet certainly, good fruit attend your husbandry. One other wish I will utter, that you may have virtue given you to follow that invaluable precept, &#x2018;Let not thy right hand know what thy left hand doeth.&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 6:3.</note> A precept very difficult to follow in your peculiar circumstances, but one which all men, in all circumstances, can in some manner follow, and which no man departs from without fatal damage to his enterprise, as many low-spouting &#x2018;Mechanics&#x2019; Institutes,&#x2019; Bible Societies even, and Exeter-hall &#x2018;labours of love,&#x2019; may, in their present ruinous state, after such assiduous beating the drum, well testify to us.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Believe me, dear Sir, yours very sincerely,</salute></closer> <name>T. <hi rend="small-caps">Carlyle</hi>.</name></p>

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x2014;</salute>Thanks for your Clippings. It is the first I have <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> of such lucubrations; which, I understand, are going on, in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> and elsewhere, as well as generally in certain idle circles of society, at a considerable rate.

The solution of the whole matter is, That my &#x201C;Unknown Correspondent,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Squire.</note> a man of perfect <pb id="pg-22-194" n="22:194"/>veracity, is also a man of the profoundest <hi rend="italic">ignorance</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">half-mad</hi> to boot; which, as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has to <hi rend="italic">read</hi> it, is a thing somewhat unhandy for me to write and print! On the whole, I do not see that, on any compulsion such as has yet manifested itself or is like to manifest itself, I can write or print any word farther on this small subject; but I have some purpose, if the noise do not abate, to <hi rend="italic">transmit</hi> all these Paper-clippings silently some day to my &#x201C;Unknown Correspondent&#x201C;; which, I calculate, may very possibly bring him straight up to Town with a big oak stick in his hand, and a terrible question or two, accompanied with raps on the floor, to certain Able Editors! Never in my life did I see a more foolish business</p>
<p>On this last day of the Year, let me send you our united good-wishes; may &#x2019;48 not be <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than his predecessors, but far better, if we can manage it! To look back and look forward, makes a man very serious on such a day.&#x2014;&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

Since reading that article to which I myself gave implicit credence I have heard the matter frequently discussed &#x26; even pronounced to be a clever joke of the Editor&#x2019;s. This has induced me to trouble you upon the point &#x26; if it is not making too great a demand upon your valuable time I should esteem it a great honor to receive a communication from yourself on the subject.&#x201C; The letter was pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1848-01-15">15 Jan.</date></note></p>
<p>Your first impression, which I think is more honourable to your sense of veracity, was the correct one; and will have to become the universal and final one.

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x2014;</salute>Here is the paltry jotting,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the Squire papers, which, reworked by Forster and then revised by TC, appeared at length in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1848-01-15">15 Jan.</date> See K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;A New Review (of Himself) by Carlyle: The Squire Forgeries, <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> (<date when="1848-01-15">15 January</date>),&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Newsletter</hi> 3 (<date when="1982-00-00">1982</date>):9&#x2013;14. A MS fragment (FC) and proof sheets corrected by TC correspond to the last five paragraphs, which are certainly by him. They stress how extraordinarily &#x201C;daring&#x201C; the thirty-five letters would be as forgeries and how it would be &#x201C;nothing short of a miracle&#x201C; if an &#x201C;apprentice-hand&#x201C; could &#x201C;have achieved such a master-piece.&#x201C; It argues that the &#x201C;internal evidence in their favour&#x201C; is &#x201C;decisive&#x201C; and that the sole grounds for suspicion are worthless and &#x201C;rest upon surmises that particular words are modern.&#x201C; It adds that such evidence is uncertain and in any case might seem to arise because of mistranscription, and it declares &#x201C;our own unhesitating belief&#x201C; in the letters. On a clipping of the article TC wrote: &#x201C;By <hi rend="italic">Forster</hi> himself (after talk &#x26;c with me). The <hi rend="italic">last</hi> piece in the Controversy, or nearly so. <date when="1848-02-00">Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1848</date> the F.

And if you can in any way, contrive to have <hi rend="italic">me</hi> delivered from all farther babble or <hi rend="italic">concern</hi> in the discussion. I really do not care many pence <hi rend="italic">how</hi> it end. N.B. I think you <hi rend="italic">should</hi> admit that the controversy is &#x201C;insignificant,&#x201C; for such it really is. Nothing but a <hi rend="italic">D&#x2019;ye give it up</hi>; fit for Bruce and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>.</p>
<p>Finally, will it not be better to wait till next week?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., for the issue of <date when="1848-01-15">15 Jan.</date>, not for <date when="1848-01-08">8 Jan.</date></note> Then I can have Blakely&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">consent</hi>,&#x2014;or even make <hi rend="italic">him</hi> publish the two Letters in a Norfolk Paper;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to Blakely&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1847-12-30">30 Dec.</date>, and TC&#x2019;s reply, <date when="1848-01-01">1 Jan.</date> Blakely responded to TC in an undated letter: &#x201C;I feel extremely obliged by your polite attention to my request &#x26; I beg to say that whenever you should feel inclined to visit Norwich in the neighbourhood of which I am residing I shall be happy to entertain you as a guest.&#x201C; On the letter TC has written: &#x201C;Blakely (Norwich man) his 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Note&#x2014;(first is in <hi rend="italic">Exam</hi>).&#x201C; The correspondence was not printed in any newspaper other than the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, which stated that &#x201C;the following correspondence has been sent to us by Mr. Blakely, with a request that it should appear in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>.&#x201C;.</note> and then you can quote? Won&#x2019;t that do better. Think.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Here has Bruce&#x2019;s ultimatum come today: very <hi rend="italic">shrill</hi> indeed, and quite <pb id="pg-22-197" n="22:197"/>astonished and evidently much mortified that he has not in the least stirred my judgement!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bruce&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1848-01-03">3 Jan.</date>, of eight pages included four additional pages of &#x201C;errata.&#x201C; The tone was less shrill than TC fancied. Bruce did say, however: &#x201C;You may rely upon it the matter will not rest. I hear, on all hands, talk and astonishment, and in some shape or other you will be drawn forward to say a few words more about them. No one believes one jot of the story [told by Squire] about the burning [of his papers].&#x201C; The list of errata ends, &#x201C;But I must discontinue this niggling Dryasdustism for today more tomorrow.&#x201C;.</note>&#x2014; Read, and carefully preserve with the others.</p>
<p>Take care of that swelled face! Last night was a very mad proceeding; and we here are chargeable with Sin[?] towards you. In hope of better news <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>As there are probably a great many persons in the same doubt you were in, regarding those Cromwell Letters, and the insane controversy that has arisen respecting them,&#x2014;might I ask you to have the kindness to <hi rend="italic">publish</hi> those two Notes that passed between you and me on the subject. Yours was the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> inquiry of that kind directed to me, and it states the question as well as possible, and gets it conclusively answered: the printing of these two Notes might save the writing of a great many similar ones;&#x2014;I have no other reason for asking <hi rend="italic">you</hi> specially to come forward in the business.</p>
<p>Might I therefore request you to send a Copy of the two Notes, addressed: &#x201C;To the Editor of the Examiner / 5. Wellington Street, Strand / London&#x201C;; merely mentioning that it is at my request;&#x2014;and that Gentleman will, with due courtesy of manner, manage all the rest. If you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> no Copy of your Note, and have lost mine, then be so good as merely send your permission to publish them, and it will still do.</p>
<p>I am just going out of Town for some time; and could not refuse the Gentleman in question my authority to take that small step, and ventured also to say that he seemed to me pretty sure of yours; against which indeed I cannot conceive that there will be, to a lover of truth and of quietness, any objection. One other element of the favour will be: <hi rend="italic">speed</hi> on your part;&#x2014;as Editors are generally in haste to get their Articles ready. I have promised that your answer would be in Wellington Street if possible on Monday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1848-01-10">10 Jan.</date></note>&#x2014;on Tuesday morning at latest.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-22-198" n="22:198"/>Many thanks for your hospitable purposes announced in Note second;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Undated but ca. <date when="1848-01-02">2 Jan.</date></note> of which if I ever come into your region, I shall have due memory.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We still date from this place; unluckily (and perhaps luckily too) we are still here! On the morning of Saturday, when all was standing <hi rend="italic">packed</hi>, and every arrangement made, poor Jane, much against her will, reported that she had not slept <hi rend="italic">at all</hi> over night, that there was a decided feeling of <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> upon her;&#x2014;and of course we could not, and cannot yet go. She has been in bed ever since; and, among her regrets there is this one consolation, that the illness overtook her <hi rend="italic">before</hi> going off and not after, which would have made everything far worse.&#x2014; &#x2014; She is not by any means very ill; but she is close confined to bed hitherto: so that, all thought of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> going a-visiting on this occasion must be laid aside, I fear. She seemed decidedly <hi rend="italic">better</hi> yesterday; but last night again she slept ill, and is of course at rather a lower figure today. We have <hi rend="italic">frost</hi> too; and at soonest, till that go, I do not expect any perfect healing for her. Jack comes daily; does what he can: but there is little or no help possible in such a case,&#x2014;except &#x201C;from pleading and patience,&#x201C; as I have heard you say.</p>
<p>We were much obliged by Isabella&#x2019;s Letter. You too are very weakly, dear Mother! Keep <hi rend="italic">close</hi>, during this rude weather: &#x201C;patience&#x201C; I need not recommend to you, as I know you have it.</p>
<p>Two men have come in upon me; I must terminate today. I will write another line tomorrow or next day. It is for the present settled that I am to go myself to Alverstoke (where I believe there is a kind of <hi rend="italic">party</hi> expecting us): on Wednesday I am to go: but of course it all depends on Jane&#x2019;s growing at least no <hi rend="italic">worse</hi>. <closer><salute>Good b&#x2019;ye, dear Mother.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x2014;</salute>Here is a new Note from Bruce;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bruce wrote, <date when="1848-01-09">9 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;The whole &#x2018;Squirearchy&#x2019; is safe from any attack from me! But for your note [see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480107-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1848-01-07">7 Jan.</date></ref>], I should have written a word to a friend at Yarmouth, to ask him &#x2018;who and what&#x2019; the unknown was deemed to be, but your will is absolute in the matter.&#x201C;.</note> which is not of any importance, but which you can stick to the rest, and keep there for me.</p>
<p>Mrs C. continues still unwell (tho&#x2019; not <hi rend="italic">very</hi>); confined to her room;&#x2014;decides on sending <hi rend="italic">me</hi> off, and gives up her own share of the journey, or postpones it into the vague. I go <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>: if she cannot follow me, as I think she will not, my stay will of course be the shorter. My Brother must superintend in my absence.</p>
<p>It is possible you may have sent some <hi rend="italic">proof</hi> or the like to Alverstoke,&#x2014;which I cannot now get hold of till Wednesday night, properly till <hi rend="italic">Thursday morning</hi>: this will throw the answer back till <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> morning (at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Field) I fear. If so, my decision is: Proceed straight forward, <hi rend="italic">without me</hi>,&#x2014;as if I were not there, as if I were not alive at all. That is the rule.</p>
<p>And come here and see what they are doing, some day, while I am off. <closer><salute>And Heaven prosper us all:&#x2014;so prays (in his great haste)</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Isabella,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your prompt Letter. It has been sent up, as you may infer, from the Hampshire Address, our journey thither having failed; and reaches me still <hi rend="italic">before</hi> leaving Chelsea. I wrote to my Mother yesterday, explaining by what bad accident we were still here; how I had engaged to go by myself on Wednesday (tomorrow); and promising another word before I went.</p>
<p>Our frost still continues, calm and grey; nevertheless Jane has had sleep last night (almost contrary to my hopes), and feels considerably easier and quieter today: so that, I suppose, there is nothing for it but my setting out tomorrow as proposed,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I confess I have but small heart in the business, and would decidedly prefer sitting in a silent condition, <hi rend="italic">cowering</hi> <pb id="pg-22-201" n="22:201"/>over my own <hi rend="italic">ingle</hi> in this grim weather. The Dr was here last night, as usual; very attentive: but there can little be done; good <hi rend="italic">care</hi> till the weather soften,&#x2014;that is nearly all.</p>
<p>We are very sorry to hear of poor Mary&#x2019;s illness; we hope she will creep close into some warm nook, and keep quiet till the storm go.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella wrote to John Carlyle, <date when="1848-01-19">19 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;We have not got direct word from the Gill for a week back. Mary was considerably better then&#x201C; (MS: NLS 1775B.13).</note> My poor Mother too is evidently very weak; but I trust she herself, and you for backing, will take every care of her, and prevent matters from getting <hi rend="italic">worse</hi>; we cannot well expect great improvement till the weather soften. Many thanks to you, dear Isabella, for the attention you shew to my Mother: you know well you could not, nor could any one otherwise so vitally oblige me! I hope now this frost may be the last of the season:&#x2014;Jack speaks of <hi rend="italic">coming down</hi> to Scotsbrig, if my Mother grew worse;&#x2014;but this, we trust will not be needed. He will be down before very long, I think, at any rate: his Translation proceeds apace; and he will want a holiday after that job is done. He has stood <hi rend="italic">very</hi> toughly to it; that must be admitted by all.&#x2014; Has he written to you again about your Sister? We are both of us much concerned to hear of her sad ailment.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella wrote John Carlyle, <date when="1848-01-19">19 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I saw my sister [Mrs. Howatson] last night she appears to be losing her strength rapidly, the bleeding is frequent and very severe, and leaves her much exhausted.&#x201C;.</note> I myself think there should be an <hi rend="italic">Operation</hi> consulted of <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>. Carlisle is now <hi rend="italic">close</hi> upon you by railway; there must be some good Surgeon there; and above all, an operation now <hi rend="italic">is without pain</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anesthesia during surgery having been in use for the past year.</note></p>
<p>I will write again to some of you in a day or two. <closer><salute>Keep within doors; and take care of yourselves, all of you weak ones! Yours ever truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>

<p><salute>O, my Dear,</salute> I hope you are a little better today up, and able to look about you,&#x2014;better off, in short, than I am; <hi rend="italic">unslept</hi>, dyspeptic, bewildered; unable (for the moment) to procure a <hi rend="italic">pen</hi>; and therefore writing (for the time is short) with pencil. Nay here is James<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Baring servant.</note> at last come up with a kind of pen; let me employ the few moments I can count on, and use that.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-22-202" n="22:202"/>I got into the railway &#x26;c all right; and got along well except that it grew ever <hi rend="italic">colder</hi> in spite of all I could wrap, and the flurry of the morning, I felt, had hurt me. Reading was but little available. I sat looking out into the dim grey fields in silence. The stage after Winchester, our Coach-door opened, and there with a great heap of packages came&#x2014;Rich<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Milnes. The same foolish social talking mortal as ever: he had been <hi rend="italic">at</hi> the Grange; and then also at Lord Palmerston&#x2019;s,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The seat of Henry John Temple (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27112"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 3d Viscount Palmerston, foreign sec., was Broadlands, Hants., nr. Romsey and only a few mi. from Alverstoke.</note> from which latter place he was now coming.&#x2014; The &#x201C;open carriage&#x201C; stood waiting at the Station; Milnes&#x2019;s &#x201C;impudence&#x201C; (cool of the evening) laid on &#x201C;luggage,&#x201C; this time, enough and to spare! My cigar was not done, when we arrived here; found Mr Baring and the Lady sitting at a baddish fire,&#x2014;very glad to see us;&#x2014;and after a little while it was time to go and dress, dinner being at 6. I already felt flurried as I say, and hurt; the room was cold for my new dress, I had not a &#x201C;pleasant&#x201C; evening: but the sticking-place was the night! <foreign>Ach Gott</foreign>! Dearest, why do I complain to poor Thee; confined to thy own bed at present! Well I will not complain: only if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had been strong, I would have told you how very weak and wretched I was. Some time about 3, I think, I got asleep (after <hi rend="italic">bathing</hi> &#x26;c); woke again some time after 5, went down out of doors to smoke,&#x2014;had slept about 3 minutes more, when James with his brushed clothes &#x26;c started me up again, and there it ended. That is my history: an excuse at least for incoherent writing;&#x2014; In fact, if it were not for my own consolation (for I know thou lovest me, Goodykin in spite of all thy harshnesses and distrusts) I think I need not have written at all. It seemed to me last light with triple and tenfold emphasis, what it has all along seemed, that I had been much better in my own bed at Chelsea than in this one!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am in the room I had last year; very <hi rend="italic">dry</hi>, and the house all full of hot air; but the window will not go up! The <hi rend="italic">hot air</hi> had a sickly stove-smell, very disagreeable in the night. The other room is reserved for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, your old one, for it is still taken for granted that you are to come; and Lady Harriet says she has written to you to that effect this morning (to arrive <hi rend="italic">tonight</hi>):&#x2014;and sure enough if you do not come, my stay here is like to be but brief. However, I will by no means advise, today at least,&#x2014;nor till I am better. I am thankful a thousand times you took that illness not <hi rend="italic">here</hi> but in your own shop; it would have driven you crazy the confused element we have here, had you arrived in it sick!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Nobody but Milnes here, who is loose-flowing, sophistic, paradoxical, utterly <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, as ever. All alas is <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, and I think is like to be! The Lady seems herself a little unwell; is in an inferior key of spirits; played a great <pb id="pg-22-203" n="22:203"/>deal, last night, Milnes occasionally <hi rend="italic">singing</hi>. I begged for <hi rend="italic">Coolun</hi>;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a popular song.</note> could not get it. Good Mr Baring has the old serenity of <hi rend="italic">farnientism</hi> [delightful idleness] quite unimpaired.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Before going to bed this (Thursday) night I will do one virtuous thing: write you a single word to satisfy where I am, and so far as may be how we <pb id="pg-22-204" n="22:204"/>are. According to my last prediction in Isabella&#x2019;s Letter, I set out from home yesterday about Noon,&#x2014;in a feeble dampish kind of frost; Jane, considerably better, but still too weak to think of venturing with me;&#x2014;and so after a ride of 3 or 4 hours, I got without accident to the Station, some mile and half off this; and found the good people&#x2019;s carriage waiting for me, and the good people themselves very glad to see me. I should say to see <hi rend="italic">us</hi>; for Mr Milnes, the other member of the party, had joined my train towards the end of the journey (at the Station on this side of Winchester), and even stept into the carriage where I was; which proved of course a pleasant meeting to us both. We parted last at Forster&#x2019;s in Yorkshire; Milnes has been in Spain &#x26;c since, and here again on the Southampton railway we met.</p>
<p>I have not flourished very much in the way of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> since I came hither, and today in the morning I felt as if I should have been a good deal happier <hi rend="italic">at home</hi>: but by keeping quiet all day, and taking care of myself, I feel a good deal better already; and tonight, hope to get a fair sleep, which will set me on my feet again. We are just <hi rend="italic">four</hi> at present, no stranger except Milnes and me; but more are coming about the end of the week: and the house, at any rate, as you know, is full of valets, servants and sublime formalities, which do not much contribute to my comfort for one&#x2019;s! I sat down today on a fine green place near the shore; and smoking a cigar, saw a band of cheerful Boys playing football: that is the pleasantest half-hour I have yet had here. A little farther on, more towards Portsmouth, were several large gangs of Convicts labouring, soldiers keeping watch over them with fixed bayonets: the poor wretches, sad blackguards almost all, by the looks of them, were dragging little cartloads of rubbish, stones &#x26;c, for some new dock-works that are building: they wore a dim-grey very coarse kind of jacket, their stocking have two or three broad white stripes round the leg, and at the right ancle each Convict wears an iron welded round the place, by which he can be chained at night. <hi rend="italic">These</hi> were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a very pleasant spectacle!</p>
<p>Of course, having no news yet from home, not having got any here, I have as good as none to tell you. John I hope will have a little word on the road for me tonight; and I will keep this open till tomorrow morning, that I may tell you what it is. I expect to hear of farther improvement, for the weather too has altered for the better. The Lady has written very pressingly for Jane; but I think it is very uncertain whether she will decide to come, or whether she <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to decide,&#x2014;and if she do not, I myself am not like to stay long; which too, as our life here is but a very <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> one, is not perhaps much to be regretted. We shall see how it goes.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I have bright lights here, and a clear glowing fire; and can <pb id="pg-22-205" n="22:205"/>figure <hi rend="italic">you</hi> far off, all <hi rend="italic">asleep</hi> (I hope) at Scotsbrig, with the sound of the Burn rushing past: Oh, may a good Presence be with you, dear Mother,&#x2014;with you and with them all! That is my <hi rend="italic">good-night</hi>: all being quiet here, I too ought to be in my bed. I hope to add a word tomorrow morning, if good news come.&#x2014; How are <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, in your weak state? Alas, there is no answer but one of my own shaping; however having heard so lately I will hope the best. <closer><salute>Good night dear Mother</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p><hi rend="italic">Friday morning</hi>. I have had a fair night&#x2019;s sleep, and (<hi rend="italic">after</hi> breakfast) expect to feel tolerably well!&#x2014; Here is John&#x2019;s Letter too, reporting favourably from Chelsea.</p></ps>

<p><salute>My dear Jeannie,&#x2014;</salute>A short but favourable Note from John came this morning: pray thank him, and bid him <hi rend="italic">send another</hi>, if he be a good man. We have a Post in the evening too;&#x2014;also one from us, rather uncertain, which hits <hi rend="italic">your</hi> evening: I wrote by it this morning early, or rather last night late, to my Mother. You are still mostly in bed, as I gather; cold still there, John says, but you stronger to bear it. Well, we must wait.</p>
<p>As for me, nothing has occurred, except that, by ingenuity and force, I have got my window to shoot up;&#x2014;item, by aid of <hi rend="italic">pill</hi> and care in regimen, I did make out some reasonable degree of sleep last night, and tho&#x2019; terribly <hi rend="italic">boiled</hi> and yellow this day, am considerably quieter today. I stay upstairs,&#x2014;dressing-gown versus cold (and here is the maid just come to light the fire);&#x2014;finding it usefuller to be out of all noise. Nothing can be stiller than the grey slumberous scene I command from this window: I believe they are all out walking; I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> quite handily walk,&#x2014;might I not perhaps try for a short <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> on one of these horses! It is now turned of 3 o&#x2019;clock.</p>
<p>Forster has sent me this morning a magnanimous Proof of an Article on Squire: very confident, dashing, well-done. He offered to give me an additional <hi rend="italic">Copy</hi> or two of the Examiner: one for Squire I declined; but asked one for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, if he liked, tomorrow night or sunday. Mine, I suppose, will come hither? Of no importance, which way, to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. Forster&#x2019;s Article <pb id="pg-22-206" n="22:206"/>will probably not <hi rend="italic">settle</hi> the barking of the Ryde dogs,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal, <date when="1848-02-09">9 Feb.</date>, TC wrote: &#x201C;Inane and indeed almost distracted, and altogether despicable controversy about Squire&#x2019;s &#x2018;35 Letters of Cromwell&#x2019; lately published in Fraser, it is a kind of riddle: &#x2018;D&#x2019;ye give it up?&#x2019; here the charm of it for blockheads. Or like the dogs of a village after bedtime: old woman throws a cracked porringer out of window, one dog barks, all dogs take up the tale; fill the village with it: and nothing after all but one cracked porringer flung out of window by an orderly old Housekeeper giving to the street what is the street&#x2019;s!&#x2014; Squire &#x2018;my unknown correspondent&#x2019; wrote to me like a man that could easily be driven <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> mad if I introduced him <hi rend="italic">farther</hi> into that dog-tumult: wherefore I forebore. The contest is not yet ended: no word of mine has mingled or shall mingle in such an insanity. To myself the matter is and was always <hi rend="italic">clear</hi>: and it is too entirely insignificant for my struggling to bring anybody round to my opinion. Let each have his own, in Heaven&#x2019;s name.&#x2014;&#x201C;.</note> but it will do something towards settling it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Taylors&#x201C; are coming tonight;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry and Theodosia Alice Taylor.</note> then some other body, then some other&#x2014;ach Himmel! Milnes goes on Sunday. If I were in better spirits, I could get a good deal of entertainment with him. He is to be off for Yorkshire; was writing to Emerson today.</p>

I think the fire has gone out again, and I am grown very cold, revising that Proof of Fuz&#x2019;s.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster&#x2019;s.</note></p>

<p><salute>Thanks for your letter Dear&#x2014;</salute>wrested, it would seem,&#x2014;that is, the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> for it&#x2014;from &#x201C;the Black Dog&#x2019;s Maw.&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451204-JWC-JW-01"><sic>20:70</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1845-12-04">4 Dec. 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> You will have slept better the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> night, and be in better heart today.</p>
<p>I said that in solitary confinement I should have nothing to tell you&#x2014;unless about my own <hi rend="italic">feelings</hi>; whereon, as the Chorus in <hi rend="italic">Agamemnon</hi> says, &#x201C;an imme<supplied>[n]</supplied>se dead weight of silence has fallen on my tongue&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Aeschylus, 38&#x2013;39, spoken by the watchman.

Contrary to expectation however; I find myself with already more things to tell than strength to put them in writing.

We had also a <hi rend="italic">Beggar</hi>, noteworthy as &#x201C;the most dreadfully <hi rend="italic">mercenary</hi> looking old fellow&#x201C; Anne had ever seen, and lastly came Aubrey de Vere&#x2019;s book for you,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aubrey Thomas De Vere (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1902-00-00">1902</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32797"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Irish poet and essayist, author of <hi rend="italic">English Misrule and Irish Misdeeds</hi> (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>).

He met TC, <date when="1845-05-28">28 May 1845</date>, at &#x201C;a dull, easy dinner&#x201C; at the Ashburtons&#x2019;, where &#x201C;Carlyle inveighed bitterly against Lord Brougham [Whig politician; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430201-TC-JSM-01"><sic>16:41</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1843-02-01">1 Feb. 1843</date></corr></ref>] and &#x2018;oratory,&#x2019; pronouncing them both the merest shams&#x201C; (Wilfrid Ward, <hi rend="italic">Aubrey De Vere: A Memoir</hi> [<date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>] 79). Probably soon thereafter, he wrote to a correspondent from the Grange: &#x201C;The Carlyles are here, and the Diogenes-Samuel denounces all things as sharply as ever. To one who never heard him before his talk must be striking; but when one thinks that all his time is spent in wielding Thor&#x2019;s hammer and trying to demolish the small fragments of Reverence and Truth that remain in embodied form, it is very sad. &#x2026; [H]e will decry the most sacred and fundamental truths on hazard, and without taking the trouble to enquire whether they are true or not, merely to round one of those sentences to which, as a victim of phrases, he is subject. &#x2026; Notwithstanding all this, I like listening to him better than to most people one meets in society. &#x2026; His wife interests me too in her way. She seems sincere and severe, and has that proportion of still and quiet will which is always tragic, because one remembers against how many things in this world it will blunt itself&#x201C; (Ward 79&#x2013;80).</note> with a note, which (the Book) I will send to Stanhope Street, unless you tell me Lady Harriet has got a copy of her own.</p>

Masson, who was once Christie&#x2019;s schoolfellow and who had introduced him to TC, wrote: &#x201C;The last incident of this London tragedy in my recollection is a visit which Alexander Bain and I paid to poor Christie&#x2019;s vacant room after his death for the purpose of making such arrangements as were possible, by inventory and sale of his worldly goods, for the benefit of his little boy&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Memories of London in the &#x2019;Forties</hi> [<date when="1908-00-00">1908</date>] 81).</note> I need not trouble you with the whole letter as you are already out of patience with the Christie-concern The only other letter was one returned from Alverstoke from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newton<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Anne Newton.</note> full of thanks to me for having <pb id="pg-22-208" n="22:208"/>given her &#x201C;the very best nursemaid her children ever had&#x201C;&#x2014; The girl herself has written to Anne&#x2014;in hieroglyphics however&#x2014;from which we can only decipher that she &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">lyk the pleace mush</hi></foreign>&#x201C; So <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is one small &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">go</hi>&#x2019; amidst plenty of failures&#x2014; Anthony Sterling came on his way from Headly to ask the Alverstoke address&#x2014;had lost it&#x2014;wished to write about the cigars&#x2014; No cigars to be got just now&#x2014;and when they come to hand he is told to <hi rend="italic">lock them up</hi> for six months&#x2014;ergo: you must take your measures independently of him&#x2014; He asked if I would be up in the evening&#x2014;was told I hoped <hi rend="italic">to</hi>&#x2014;that at all events John would be here&#x2014; At midday I rose, and on the strength of a good nights sleep put on <hi rend="italic">stays</hi> &#x201C;and the usual <foreign><hi rend="italic">et ceteras</hi></foreign>&#x201C;&#x2014;tidyed my bedroom and disposed the furniture so as to give myself more space&#x2014;then sat down to my two thick volumes on <hi rend="italic">Insanity</hi>&#x2014;a very interesting study indeed&#x2014; But Darwin came again and this time I had him up&#x2014;very <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> and kind&#x2014; Then Miss Williams Wynne came and undaunted by the fact of a <hi rend="italic">bedroom</hi> stayed with me two hours&#x2014;not letting <hi rend="italic">me</hi> talk too much but amusing me all she could&#x2014;she is a good kind woman I think and with plenty of sense when she <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> come out with it.

<p><salute>Many thanks, dear Forster:</salute> you have written a capital article, which ought to settle the thing, if there could be any settlement of such things. But will <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi> dissipate itself by one&#x2019;s firing cannon-balls thro&#x2019; it? People will at least let it alone, after that!</p>
<p>I have read the columns carefully over; and find nothing but mere errors of the press (probably corrected already) to note,&#x2014;all of which too I have noted; and two other miniscule [?] changes of phrase, which, unless you think them improvements, and they come quite in time, do not mind; for they are of no intrinsic significance at all.</p>
<p>On the whole, do not let us send any Newspaper to poor W. S.:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Squire.</note> he will see it at any rate, and be still more comforted, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> frightened at all, by its coming spontaneously. But if you will take or send a Copy down to Chelsea, tomorrow or Sunday, it will be a welcome treat there,&#x2014;for my Copy comes hither, and cannot return till Monday. However, do not mind that, if you are busy. My poor Dame, I believe, is mostly or altogether upstairs still; getting out of her cold, John says, and doing well,&#x2014;but I think still in her own room, and weakly enough. Whether she is to follow me <pb id="pg-22-210" n="22:210"/>hither, still hangs; and I rather fear the negative, but keep it <hi rend="italic">private</hi>. In that case my stay too is likely to be the shorter.</p>
<p>Hitherto I have not got on well here; having got all flurried by the cold railway, by &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;and never attained to any reasonable talent of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> since I left home. Milnes and I are the only guests at present; but more are coming, this day and other days,&#x2014;at whom, in my present shivery state, I rather shudder! But courage: the road home is always open!&#x2014; Well fare you, dear Forster. You shall hear of me when I return</p>

In time she meets her half-sister, Alice Bryant, her father&#x2019;s legitimate da., married to a dominating ironmaster. Conrad Percy falls in love with Alice, and they are about to elope when she dies in convulsions. The novel is concerned with the contrast between Bianca, an exceptional woman of personal dignity and passion who finds fulfillment in a career, and her weak, conventionally &#x201C;respectable&#x201C; half-sister. Jewsbury&#x2019;s last book was <hi rend="italic">Zoe</hi> (<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>).</note> But what can you or I help it; since as herself said of herself long ago, she &#x201C;has absolutely no <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> <pb id="pg-22-211" n="22:211"/>of decency&#x201C; What I regret more than the <hi rend="italic">questionability</hi> of these chapters is the total want of common sense&#x2014; But perhaps my illness makes me see things worse than they are<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is likely that JWC&#x2019;s ill health made her more acutely critical. In a long letter to JWC, dated Wed., <date when="1848-03-00">March 1848</date>, in Ireland, Jewsbury complained of JWC&#x2019;s brevity and sharpness in two letters about this time, which she came to see was due to illness: &#x201C;There was a tone in both letters that very much annoyed me &#x2026; and I never received two such utterly, utterly, unsatisfactory letters from you since I knew you. &#x2026; I sin against your notions of good taste very often, and that is quite enough to give you a distaste to me for the time being, but I don&#x2019;t see how it can be anything of a graver nature&#x201C; (Ireland 242&#x2013;44). In fact JWC&#x2019;s criticisms of her friend&#x2019;s frankness in her novels, which began as something of a joke, may well have pained her, as frankness was often essential to Jewsbury&#x2019;s challenging approach.</note>&#x2014; At all events I feel it idle for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to protest any more&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am out of bed now most of the day, but see no prospect of being able to <hi rend="italic">follow</hi> to Alverstoke&#x2014; Perhaps you will come and see me some day&#x2014; By the way, was it not from <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that I took this cold?</p>

<p>You have got a headache, poor little creature, by your exertion in writing to me,&#x2014;so John intimates,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1848-01-15">15 Jan.</date>, that JWC had a headache, which she said &#x201C;had come on after the exertion of writing&#x201C; to TC.</note>&#x2014;and today we must put up with that for news! Take care of yourself, I bid you; and do not talk too much to your Miss Wynne, and on the whole keep quiet, and get well again soon.&#x2014; &#x2014; Today too I am writing in the Drawingroom, three people (two Taylors <hi rend="italic">and Buller</hi>) round me: so put up with the confused rubbish I must send you.</p>
<p>Nothing passed yesterday: I rode in the carriage with Mrs Taylor to <pb id="pg-22-212" n="22:212"/>Gosport; Baring and Milnes were for &#x201C;a survey of the fortifications&#x201C;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The naval base and Fort Blockhouse are nr. Gosport, on Portsmouth harbor.</note> I declined to attend, being unable for much walking; but we all went together to Gosport, whence I and the little Lady returned,&#x2014;she very <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>, I safe in my watchcoat not. After that I read, and smoked, and <hi rend="italic">daundered</hi> [strolled] about,&#x2014;Lady Harriet out riding with a groom, having formally declined <hi rend="italic">me</hi> on Baring&#x2019;s proposition of me: in the afternoon came Sir J. Richardson, with whom Taylor and I talked,&#x2014;whom I then accompanied round by Haslar<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Haslar Hospital, where Sir John Richardson was chief physician, was also on the harbor.</note> (declining to <hi rend="italic">enter</hi>), and so home a little after sunset; and the day (all but dinner) was again <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. &#x201C;O Paig, Paig, a misspent life!&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> After dinner was all done, Buller unexpectedly came stumbling in; very absent, mazed-looking, and with some faintish tint of officiality visible in his new manner; a &#x201C;pleasant additament&#x201C; for the evening: he returns tomorrow. His Father is ill; influenza they call it: so he could not go to St Leonard&#x2019;s,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A resort town in Sussex, W of Hastings.</note> and had come off hither for his Saturday. Milnes was to go today; but puts it off till tomorrow: we lose the availablest element we had when Milnes goes, and are like to be sadder, whether wiser or not, when the Taylors alone remain.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Harriet had reported to JWC, [<date when="1848-01-13">13 Jan.</date>], one of Milnes&#x2019;s joking remarks: &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle has agreed at Milnes&#x2019;s suggestion to wear Rouge when he drives out in London to bear <hi rend="italic">a festive look</hi>&#x2014;.&#x201C;.</note></p>
<p>I was very uneasy, sickly, dispirited and every way unwell yesterday; but towards evening I began to feel better, and today, after a better sleep than previously, I feel decidedly improved. On Friday afternoon I did, with effort, succeed in getting out the Pony, a thing as fat as a pig and quite wheezy and lazy: but it jog-trotted with me for an hour and half, and was greatly better than <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> in my then circumstances. On Monday, tomorrow early, it appears, there is a horse coming for my use, &#x201C;a steady hack,&#x201C; of which I shall be extremely glad as matters stand,&#x2014;at least till I get into walking trim again. This, Dearest, is all the poor news I have to send thee from my Castle of Indolence: if there were more, I would transcribe it gladly!&#x2014; &#x2014; All the curiosity is now to know whether &#x201C;Mrs Carlyle is getting fast better?&#x201C; Everything turns on that, it seems! On the whole, I have yet given no program of my own stay; but it is understood I am soon to go if you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come. The weather today is <hi rend="italic">beautiful</hi>, sunny &#x26;c,&#x2014;in fact, capital weather and air here: but that is all we have to brag of specially! Do as your own feeling and insight finds good. I think the railway <hi rend="italic">journey</hi> (if any) must be by express train, and with a hot jar for footstool: I myself in spite of all wrappages had got quite cold in the feet.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-22-213" n="22:213"/>No <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> has come to myself this morning! No matter: it may arrive tomorrow evening (if Jack bethink himself), which will be soon enough for me; and in the meanwhile it may have amused poor Goody for an hour the evening before.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote to TC, <date when="1848-01-16">16 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;Jane bids me tell you that the Examiner was sent here last night at eight o&#x2019;clock, so that there was no possibility of getting it dispatched by post for you.&#x201C;.</note></p>
<p>Buller and one of the Taylors are gone into the sunshine: nothing here now (not even the parrot) except little Mrs T. who is scribbling away close at my hand: a most dainty little creature, full of cheerful orthodoxy, of hero-worship for her husband, and of all manner of convenient qualities;&#x2014;looks considerably older and thinner since I saw her last.

On Taylor&#x2019;s advice the post was offered to James Spedding, who declined, as did Taylor, who wrote: &#x201C;Though I did not accept Stephen&#x2019;s office, &#x2026; I imagine that, for some time at least, my official work must have been nearly as heavy as if I had accepted it. Stephen&#x2019;s illness &#x2026; had thrown his work into a rapidly accumulating arrear &#x2026; so that the pressure brought upon me was severe. &#x2026; I hardly had time to think much of anything but my health and my work&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography of Henry Taylor</hi> [<date when="1885-00-00">1885</date>] 2:30, 32).</note> that too, it seems, is a fact.

<p><salute>My Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>A wet day, the rain falling in heavy gusts out of the Southwest, the sea and the wind making loud melody round us, and I solitary in my apartment, where the Dressing-gown enables me to dispense with fire for a while,&#x2014;before the hours go farther, I will write a word to <hi rend="italic">thee</hi>; probably the best act it may be given me all day to do.</p>
<p>I am not well still; sadly off for sleep &#x26;c; and have properly nothing to tell; but the telling of that will do me a little good perhaps as I go on.&#x2014; Yesterday proved bright sunny and every way beautiful, so far as weather <pb id="pg-22-214" n="22:214"/>went; a walk was achieved in the afternoon, and much vain talk, with Milnes especially, but nothing else whatever.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the matters TC discussed was the aristocracy: &#x201C;The English aristocracy,&#x201C; he said to Milnes, &#x201C;just now are to me a most tragic spectacle. Wonderful how they undertake that suicidal enterprise of theirs, how they endure their vacant existence. I always think of the sublime ennui of the Halls of Eblis&#x2014;of men with burning fire for hearts in their bosoms, who will stand no pity or advice in any way, but suffer on. Yet these men assimilate greatness better than any other Englishmen: they are not the Chinese jugglers of the middle class, and they alone can now save us from the absolute anarchy of the bottomless pit&#x201C; (quoted in J. Pope-Hennessy, <hi rend="italic">Monckton Milnes &#x2026; <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date></hi> 274). Eblis in Arabian mythology is a fallen angel who became the ruler of the evil genii when he refused to worship Adam as God had commanded.</note> One cannot get even reading done; hardly can the Newspaper of the day be got read.&#x2014; Today Milnes and Buller are both gone; Milnes early in the morning, as I felt to my cost, he being my wall-neighbour, and very noisy when he lifts anchor! He is gone to Yorkshire; is bent to meet Emerson if he can, and to get W. E. Forster to be of the party. Poor Milnes, he is really a social creature; and nothing can entirely abolish the <hi rend="italic">naivety</hi> that is in him. Yesterday we were speaking (in the <hi rend="italic">absence</hi> of the Taylors) about Aubrey de Vere and his Book;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480114-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1848-01-14">14 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note> I said, The first thing Aubrey would have to <supplied>[do]</supplied>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> if anything was to come of him, would be to <hi rend="italic">forget</hi> altogether that the Spring-Rices and others of the native clique had ever reckoned him a &#x201C;man of genius&#x201C; or the like; in fact, to give up the idea of his being a man of genius once for all.&#x2014; &#x201C;Hah,&#x201C; said Milnes, &#x201C;and let me tell you it is a d&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;d hard thing to give up the idea that you are a man of genius! I have had it to do; and can tell you it is no easy thing.&#x201C; Speaking of his &#x201C;happiness&#x201C; he asserted that he was deeply miserable; that if any fresh misfortune were to come upon him he would &#x201C;go and drown himself.&#x201C; &#x201C;Why, you wouldn&#x2019;t sink,&#x201C; cried Lady Harriet, &#x201C;you couldn&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">drown</hi>!&#x201C; And Milnes stands the laughter like an angel.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s observation was generally shared. Aubrey De Vere, who had known Milnes since <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>, noted after Milnes&#x2019;s death: &#x201C;His wit had no sting in it; it hurt nobody, and he was not easily hurt himself. He had a great relish for amusement, and a benevolent desire to amuse others, not much caring whether the laugh which his jest had raised went with him or was at his own expense&#x201C; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:119). The joke is recorded in his commonplace book: &#x201C;Carlyle to me &#x2018;The best thing for you wd be to be cast for some weeks, perhaps for some years on a space of blank despair.&#x201C; &#x2018;I am not sure of that&#x2014;I shd probably drown myself.&#x2019; Lady H. A. &#x2018;No&#x2014;you might throw yourself in the water but you wd float, you know&#x2019;&#x201C; (Ian Campbell, &#x201C;More Conversations with Carlyle. The Monckton Milnes Diaries: part 2,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Prose Studies</hi> 9 [<date when="1986-00-00">1986</date>]:22&#x2013;29).</note> He has left us all regretful of him; and Charteris will be a very bad exchange indeed: &#x201C;the Charterises&#x201C; are coming, however, today; perhaps are come, when I go down stairs! Taylor is but a dull element; he is reading <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Copy of his Essay-Book,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Notes from Life</hi>.</note> having discovered pencil-notes of mine in <pb id="pg-22-215" n="22:215"/>it,&#x2014;little flattering, I much doubt, but he asked my permission, and I could not refuse him without making the matter look even worse. Mrs T. is a nice little body; there comes out of her, ever and anon, some innocent half-silly half-mischievous remark, which stirs up the current of things; the chief merit its <hi rend="italic">spontaneity</hi>; coming almost like a <hi rend="italic">blush</hi>, as if without her consent, and really pretty as natural things all are. Taylor is very grey, and old-looking; his words scantier and more elaborated than ever. I fear he will grow to look on me as the very genius of Chaos; for I see his understanding does not in the least discern my bearings and distances,&#x2014;unless his good honest heart may intimate to him some good tendency on my part in spite of all.&#x2014; On the whole, this is very <hi rend="italic">strenuous</hi> idling;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> 1.11.28; also 1:338.</note> I have with less suffering and exertion compassed the attendance on six College classes daily, in my time! But perhaps there is a lesson in this too; nay doubtless there <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, and I hope I shall <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> it, for the fees are not inconsiderable. My reflexions in my few hours of solitude,&#x2014;in the early mornings, amid the tramping and trotting, especially ought to be of a didactic nature!</p>
<p>But there are two new <hi rend="italic">events</hi> today: one is the arrival of a hardy useful-looking horse or high <hi rend="italic">pony</hi> from Winchester; on which, if the weather will clear, I myself or along with Baring hope yet to get a ride;&#x2014;a most useful event that. The other is, that I have changed my lodging; have got installed into the late Milnes&#x2019;s room, and there am now writing. It is the room at the very <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of the passage, where Buller, I think, used to lodge; as would appear, it was intended for me from the first, but the <foreign>valetaille</foreign> [flunkeys] put me into the old place by mistake. It is a decided improvement at any rate; a much better-looking bed; distance greater from all travail; a really beautiful view of the sea and Island<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Isle of Wight.</note> (over that <hi rend="italic">sheltered</hi> walk by the wall behind the Offices): your room too was and is somewhere on this &#x201C;eastern wing,&#x201C; tho&#x2019; I cannot yet rightly make it out:&#x2014;or perhaps <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is to be yours, after I have properly warmed it for you? In fact, I do not know; nor, till your bulletin arrive, even know whether it is worth investigating,&#x2014;by &#x201C;inquiry&#x201C; under difficulties. We expect some word tonight with great eagerness. The additional <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> of weakness I rather liked, as a sign of really increased <hi rend="italic">strength</hi>. It is possible the &#x201C;change of air,&#x201C; which could not but be beneficial, might outweigh the other conditions likely to be detrimental: but I cannot say; nobody but yourself can say. Mrs Taylor would be a kind of resource to you while she stays; but only in a small degree I fancy, and how long she stays I do not know. To the Charterises, especially to Charteris, I look forward with no anticipation but that of indifference or self-defence. Oh my Dear, I am all <hi rend="italic">tied together</hi>; as with ten thousand thrums and <pb id="pg-22-216" n="22:216"/>packthreads: this is not the place of my rest;&#x2014;alas, I know not where that is! But one is bound to keep the <hi rend="italic">lid down</hi>; otherwise there will be no broth cooked at all. <closer><salute>Oh my Goody, do not forsake me, do not distrust me,&#x2014;be good to me rather, as it is given thee! My poor Jeannie, I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> thine (if good for anything) forever,&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>Well, Dearest,</salute> I have written what I have written,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 19:22.</note> and what I have written I will keep to; If I am spared on foot till Thursday I will go on Thursday, and accept the consequences&#x2014;if any. This time; I am under engagement to go, and it is pitiful to break one&#x2019;s engagements for any thing short of necessity. But I will never, with the health I have, or rather, have <hi rend="italic">not, engage</hi> to leave home for a long fixed period another winter. One of the main uses of a <hi rend="italic">home</hi> is <hi rend="italic">to stay in it</hi>, when one is too weak and spiritless for conforming without <hi rend="italic">effort</hi> to the ways of other houses.

It is not clear whether a Chambers family had been replaced by a Chalmers one; but, as Francis Chalmer is listed in <hi rend="italic">Watkins&#x2019;s Directory</hi> (<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>), at 4 Cheyne Row, Chalmer or Chalmers is no doubt correct.</note>&#x2014;oh yes&#x2014;I had found out <hi rend="italic">that</hi> &#x201C;by my own smartness&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">before</hi> I took to reading on Insanity. To be sure it is hard on flesh and blood, when one &#x201C;has nothing to keep one at home,&#x201C; to sit down in honest life-weariness and look <pb id="pg-22-217" n="22:217"/>out into unmitigated <hi rend="italic">Zero</hi>; but perhaps it &#x201C;would be a great advantage&#x201C; just to &#x201C;go ahead&#x201C; in that&#x2014;the barefaced indigence of such a state might drive one&#x2014;like the Piper&#x2019;s Cow&#x2014;to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">consider</hi>,&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the ballad &#x201C;The Tune the Old Cow Died Of&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340815-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:269</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-08-15">15 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> and who knows but, in considering long enough, one might discover what one &#x201C;has wanted&#x201C; and what one &#x201C;wants&#x201C;&#x2014;an essential preliminary to <hi rend="italic">getting it</hi>!

<p><salute>Well, my Dear;</salute> you are coming, then, on Thursday,&#x2014;or else you are absolutely going to give it up. We shall hear tomorrow evening,&#x2014;nay <hi rend="italic">Thursday morning</hi>, now that I recollect, is still in time for being out to meet you. May it answer well! But consider <hi rend="italic">practically</hi> your strength, <hi rend="italic">your</hi> real wishes. For me I feel as if it were little I had got here, or were likely to get, but a huge nightmare of indigestion, insomnia, and fit of black impatience with myself and others,&#x2014;self chiefly! Yesterday was very wet, very windy; and I did not get out at all,&#x2014;almost the one day, these seven years, in which I have had <hi rend="italic">no</hi> exercise. The consequence was, little or no <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>; a good increase also to the stock of <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> I already had. So soon as this Note is written, I mean to be out, and have a long ride. They are all going to Gosport &#x26;c &#x26;c: I feel as if a two-hours of profound solitude amid the lanes would for me be the best recipe of all. In fact I am very unwell, and unhappy,&#x2014;for the time being.</p>
<p>The Charterises are in this Drawing-room now with me, alone here. They came yesterday about 3 o&#x2019;clock; she is very beautiful, as silent, sententious and austere as ever,&#x2014;but with a sweet laugh too, which, blending with her metallic tone of voice, is very singular and <hi rend="italic">good</hi>. We spent last night reading <hi rend="italic">the Princess</hi>: approved of (from the teeth outwards) by everybody,&#x2014;not by me any farther than before.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal, <date when="1848-02-09">9 Feb.</date>, TC wrote that <hi rend="italic">The Princess</hi> is &#x201C;a gorgeous piece of writing, but to me new melancholy proof of the futility of what they call &#x2018;Art&#x2019;&#x201C; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:422).</note> <hi rend="italic">If</hi> you come, do not forget Sterling&#x2019;s Book,&#x2014;especially not <hi rend="italic">Aeschylus</hi> We can get nothing read here, I mean individually, except for about two hours, from 11 to 1, in one&#x2019;s own room, after all have retired. The force of idleness <hi rend="italic">can</hi> no farther go!</p>
<p>The Express Train, I see, is 15 minutes past 10; too early, but it arrives in 2&#xBC; hours: an hour less than any other train takes. By whatever train you come, bring a warm big bottle for the feet (do not by any means forget that), and the horse-rug, and plaids, in short wrappages without end. Jack must go with you: a fly, and Battersea Bridge: I and the carriage will be in waiting at <hi rend="italic">this</hi> end.&#x2014; &#x2014; If you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come,&#x2014;I think I shall be for bundling, myself, about the end of the week: in fact I am heartily sick of my dyspeptic bewilderment and imprisonment here. Something beautiful and good is in the heart of the thing too; but it is clearly not for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> (at least so seems it) to <pb id="pg-22-219" n="22:219"/>unravel and get hold of! So be it.&#x2014; Lady Harriet wrote last night that you were to take <hi rend="italic">other</hi> days, if Thursday failed: but that I imagine you will hardly do; nor indeed (especially in my present mood) can I recommend it. <hi rend="italic">Tomorrow</hi>, of course, I may expect to be in better case; but in the best case I feel that home were <hi rend="italic">better</hi>. Taylor professes to be improving here: but for me I do not look for any &#x201C;improvement,&#x201C;&#x2014;with sleep in so <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> a figure.</p>
<p>Today I did not mean to write at all: but I find you will hardly hear of me at all otherwise, if you come on Thursday. I should send a line to John too, and must by no means forget my Mother and Alick&#x2019;s Letter.</p>
<p>What you say of <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> and amusements has a deal of genuine sense in it, Dear,&#x2014;only mixed perhaps a shade too much with <hi rend="small-caps">Chreosote</hi>! That too will mend. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my own little Dear. My clear duty at present is&#x2014;to go out <hi rend="italic">and ride</hi>. Ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your punctual Letters to me; for your kind care of Jane, who is very grateful for your attention to her. From herself I hear this morning that she proposes Thursday for an expedition hither. I have already written to her, and my chief reason for writing to you <hi rend="italic">today</hi> is to bid you, <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, go down and examine candidly whether you do think her fit for such a thing; then, <hi rend="italic">secondly</hi>, if your decision and hers be still in the affirmative, to see her, with all gentleness and care, put safe into the railway train,&#x2014;we being forewarned here at what hour to expect her. That is all, at present, in the way of business; and even that, I suppose, is but bidding you do the thing you have already resolved on. Better so than worse.&#x2014; For the rest, the Nodes Fly, on Thursday morning, can come to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, if you like, in the first place, and then <hi rend="italic">wait</hi> at Cheyne Row for Jane and the luggage; <foreign><hi rend="italic">nota bene</hi></foreign> too, Battersea Bridge is the road.</p>
<p>I do not get on well here at all hitherto, as Jane may have been telling you; am sadly short of sleep; and have caught, in addition to my usual dyspepsias, a considerable quantity of cold. If Jane do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> decide on coming, and I do not grow much better, I think I shall decide on coming home very soon.</p>
<p>The inclosed from Jean came today; you may shew it to Jane, who has not <pb id="pg-22-220" n="22:220"/>yet seen it. Alick&#x2019;s Letter shall go to my Mother tomorrow morning, which is our first post (equivalent to the London afternoon) since it arrived.</p>
<p>I have been out riding; a long ride, on a baddish horse, and too thinly clad for riding slow: we have a dinner-<hi rend="italic">party</hi> moreover tonight,&#x2014;some curates and sea-captains &#x26;c,&#x2014;I have not much of a prospect before me just at this moment! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother</salute></closer></p>

When Emerson called on him soon after arriving from Chelsea, Espinasse says, &#x201C;There was just a trace of irritation, the only one which I ever perceived in Emerson, in his first references to his Chelsea visit; but it soon disappeared, never to reappear. Sorrowing admiration was expressed in the remark made to one of us early during his stay in Manchester: &#x2018;Carlyle&#x2019;s heart is as large as the world, but he is growing morbid&#x2019;&#x201C; (156&#x2013;57).</note> In reply to my charge that Emerson had no ideas (except mad ones) that he had not got out of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>; Espinasse answers prettily; &#x201C;but pray, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">who has</hi>?&#x201C; He (E) had been discussin <pb id="pg-22-221" n="22:221"/>you with a &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Bey</hi>&#x2019; whom he met at Geraldines, sent by the Egyptian<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Frenchman Charles Lambert, known to the Carlyles as the Egyptian; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450206-JWC-JW-01"><sic>19:25</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1845-02-06">6 Feb. 1845</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I got your Letter here yesterday; and will send you a few words in answer without delay. We were to have come in company, Jane and I, and have paid a visit of some three weeks or more to the people here,&#x2014;the scene we were with, last year;&#x2014;and Saturday gone a week was to have been the day of our arrival: for which accordingly we had made all preparation at Chelsea, and awoke (at least I did) in expectation to set out forthwith. But poor Jane had caught a sore-throat overnight, had a good deal of cold, and in fact was palpably unable to go. She liked very ill to break her engagement, but there was no help. Our trunks stood on the floor till Wednesday morning; she in the meanwhile considerably better, but still unable to go: on Wednesday it was resolved that I should set out by myself, she to follow, if she could. Here accordingly I have been ever since. She is now expected <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>, but not quite confidently; if she cannot come tomorrow, she purposes giving it up altogether. I think perhaps she had better! However, we shall see. I myself have done no good here hitherto; <pb id="pg-22-222" n="22:222"/>have caught a cold too, what is rather rare with me;&#x2014;in fact, would as soon get home again immediately, which if Jane do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come, I purpose to do. We are a large party; full of spirits, given up to idleness; I am much too grave an object for finding my home in the like. Noises, flunkies, French-beds, and want of sleep answer very ill to me. One inference I can draw is not unimportant, tho&#x2019; indeed it is not new: The total inutility of <hi rend="italic">wealth</hi> to me, or properly to anybody. With one little maid, in our small mansion of Chelsea, what things are attainable which here I need not look for!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I did not know there was any deficiency in the supply of <hi rend="italic">F. Revolutions</hi>, or I would have supplied it. If your copy is <hi rend="italic">dirty</hi>, it will not do; my Mother&#x2019;s, as I remember, is clean. Better give them in the way you mention, and if need be I will make good the defect by and by. Thank you, dear Jean, for sending that <hi rend="italic">desk</hi> warmer to my Mother: it was precisely the kind of thing I wanted that day Jamie and I were at Dumfries; but I could not get it then.&#x2014; I have written repeatedly to Scotsbrig, but no new tidings have arrived; we understand matters to be much as they were when you left. The bad weather is severe upon our poor old Mother in this unhealthy year: when the Sun gets out, I have good hope she will also.&#x2014; Last night I sent off to her a Letter which had just come from Alick; which probably you will soon see. Nothing new from Alick; all in health; all seems to be going well with him. Jack has been very diligent in his attendance on Jane; his Book progresses, tho&#x2019; slowly; when it is done, I think he will come to you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC noted in his Journal, <date when="1848-02-08">8 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;John here, translating <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi>, this long while; grown calmer, more manful in his ways by this ballast of employment.&#x201C;.</note>&#x2014; My <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> is not yet lit here; I sit in my dressing-gown merely, in a dam<supplied>[p]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> east-windy day. <closer><salute>Better be off.

<p><salute>My Dear,</salute> I am very glad, on all accounts, that you did not venture out today: it is decidedly the coldest day we have had; wind strong from the Northeast, frost and winter in every breath of it; the cold ride, and the fret and fuss of shifting into new arrangements (supposing them even superior, which they are not) would have quite ruined you! Besides I too have got a nasty cold, not like to leave me while here; I could have do<supplied>[ne]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> nothing but shew you as in a mirror the image of your own unhappiness.

(misdating <date when="1848-01-20">20 Jan.</date> for <date when="1848-01-20">19 Jan.</date>) that &#x201C;Jane has decided upon going on saturday &#x2026; ; &#x26; I think under proper precautions she need not fear the journey. She has herself written to Lady Harriet.&#x201C;.</note> the business &#x201C;till Saturday&#x201C; was a real comfort to me this morning.</p>
<p>As to Saturday,&#x2014;Lady Harriet says she will write to you today; recommending, unless the weather alter, still farther postponement. For there <pb id="pg-22-224" n="22:224"/>are new Strangers coming on Saturday; &#x201C;the Bear and Senior,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward (&#x201C;Bear&#x201C;) Ellice.

And so the house will be all in hurlyburly till Monday when <hi rend="italic">they</hi> go again;&#x2014;when perhaps the weather too may have improved. Something like that, it would seem, will be her Ladyship&#x2019;s advice to you.</p>
<p>My own notion, Dear, I confess is somewhat different. I have got, as you hear, an ugly cold, not much of a <hi rend="italic">cough</hi>, but it settles daily deeper into the chest; and&#x2014;and I can get no right sleep; that seems impossible here. They are willing to do for me whatsoever they can; will make mutton-broth, make &#x26;c &#x26;c: but, once for all, the laws of Nature cannot be gainsayed. Sleep, in the middle of ever-tramping flunkies, slamming doors, in paltry little French-beds, with so many new <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign> round one is and remains impossible. My tendency, therefore is, to try if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can get away on Saturday:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Thurs.</note> if you had fairly <hi rend="italic">given up</hi> the enterprise, I could certainly have managed it; and still, if it can be done without offence justly taken, I will try to manage it: at all events directly after you renounce I shall be able to insist. My advice, therefore, you see, goes against her Ladyship&#x2019;s: however, I do not deny that I might possibly get round somewhat,&#x2014;one night of sleep would do it, at anytime:&#x2014;and if your own feeling points in another direction, follow that, as I follow mine and we will wait the issue that way. Hitherto I have not had &#x201C;a happy time&#x201C; here; not by any manner of means. I have now a horse too, and have been twice riding, once by myself a long ride, and yesterday with Baring for company; I have the prettiest little room too, all decked with delicate traceries in light green colour; and everybody is kind enough to me in every way: but behold all this availeth me simply nothing, so long as &#x26;c &#x26;c</p>

Lady Anne<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charteris.</note> is beautiful exceedingly,&#x2014;employs herself in knitting wristikins; speaks out, in her clear bell-like voice, from time to time, some word of sincerity that falls strangely into the current of conversationalisms. Taylor is good and honest, looks very old, almost <hi rend="italic">venerable</hi> (with a kind of weak affectionate smile that he wears); he is taciturn generally, and prosy when he speaks; for the rest, he reads Shakspeare to us in the evenings (much to his <hi rend="italic">Wife&#x2019;s</hi> comfort, who is the naivest hero-worshipper I have even seen): he is the professed <hi rend="italic">invalid</hi> of the party; but eats, as I observe, <hi rend="italic">five</hi> meals aday, and professes to be rapidly improving. In Charteris is little or no offence; the frolicsome perfection of felicity, such as only healthy <hi rend="italic">children</hi> know. Aubrey de Vere, who was invited extemporaneously, <pb id="pg-22-225" n="22:225"/>is not coming; he goes for Ireland on Saturday; and, what is much more notable, takes Alfred Tennyson with him. Alfred therefore is delivered! At least not by <hi rend="italic">London</hi> dinners shall he at this time die.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Kings 2:26. When in Ireland, De Vere wrote to a correspondent: &#x201C;Alfred Tennyson is very little restive, and I hope I shall make this visit pleasant to him. I wonder why he came, and whether he is fond of me. I fear not much so. &#x2026; I find I am growing very much attached to him. He is as simple as a child, and not less interesting for his infirmities. &#x2026; He is to breakfast alone, and sit alone half the day, musing and writing poetry&#x201C; (Ward, <hi rend="italic">Aubrey De Vere</hi> 146). TC told Emerson a few months later that Tennyson stayed &#x201C;in London through a course of eight o&#x2019;clock dinners every night, for months, until he is thoroughly fevered: then, notice is given to one of his friends, as lately to Aubrey de Vere, who has a fine estate in Ireland 30 miles from Limerick,&#x2014;to come &#x26; carry him off bodily.&#x201C; Tennyson told Emerson that &#x201C;if Carlyle thinks the Christian religion has lost all vitality, he is wholly mistaken. Tennyson &#x26; all Carlyle&#x2019;s friends feel the caprice &#x26; incongruity of his opinions&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">The Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks of Ralph Waldo Emerson</hi> 10, ed. M. M. Sealts, Jr. [Cambridge, Mass., <date when="1973-00-00">1973</date>] 538&#x2013;39).</note></p>
<p>What you say of Miss Wynne is very interesting. May you continue to find more and more good in her: one&#x2019;s stock of available friends is not large in late times.&#x2014; I write this in the Drawingroom; here has Taylor come down, proposing a walk; at all events, <hi rend="italic">ending</hi> the composure I had. <closer><salute>God bless thee, Dearest!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Well Dear,</salute> I have written to Lady Harriet that I am not going at all&#x2014;the only rational course under the circumstances&#x2014; So now you are to do what you think best for yourself without reference to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014; You are not to hurry home on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> account&#x2014;I am not so <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> as to make <hi rend="italic">that</hi> a <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> for you, nor so <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, as to make it a <hi rend="italic">pleasure</hi>. But if you continue ill yourself you will certainly be better in your own nest, with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to tell it to&#x2014;and all your own way, as far as <hi rend="italic">material</hi> things are concerned&#x2014;</p>
<p>Do not be uneasy about me&#x2014;I should know the ways of this sort of cold <hi rend="italic">by now</hi>&#x2014;and I am sure that with reasonable care it need turn to nothing dangerous&#x2014;tho it might easily be fixed in my lungs by any rashness.</p>
<p>John said he would write a note himself&#x2014; I sent for him to take counsel before I began writing<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote the same day: &#x201C;She has done well this morning in giving up the journey altogether.&#x201C;.</note>&#x2014; Some <hi rend="italic">Watts</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably relatives of Phoebe Elizabeth Hough Watt (1814?&#x2013;54), widow, da. of John Fowler of Horton Hall, N Staffs, whom John Carlyle was to marry, autumn <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>.</note> have come to town with whom he <pb id="pg-22-226" n="22:226"/>dines &#x26;c and it is amazing how in a few days he has gone all to <hi rend="italic">smithers</hi> (morally) Last night he came for an hour before going to these Watts, and found me lying on the sofa very much done up, and <hi rend="italic">cuffing</hi> worse than usual. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">How d&#x2019;ye do</hi>&#x201C;! he said like Mr Toots<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Dickens&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Dombey and Son</hi>.</note></p>

<dateline>Friday evening [<date when="1848-01-21">21 January 1848</date>]</dateline>
<p><salute>Oh dear me!</salute> I am so annoyed about those letters! if they have missed the post what <hi rend="italic">will you</hi> think <hi rend="italic">about</hi> me, and what will Lady Harriet think <hi rend="italic">of</hi> me tomorrow morning?</p>
<p>I wished to see John before writing, and sent for him so soon as I was dressed, which was not till twelve this morning&#x2014;for the Chalmerses<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The next-door neighbors; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480117-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1848-01-17">17 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note> had a <hi rend="italic">ball</hi> last night and thundered quadrilles on the piano-forte till three, and I was quite worn out. But John having already &#x201C;taken the road&#x201C; did not come till two hours after. Meanwhile I had written the note to Lady Harriet, but did not send it with <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, meaning to write also to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. Just as I had got to M<hi rend="italic">r Toots</hi> Miss Wynne arrived, and afterwards Captain Sterling (returned from Paris with his Wife)&#x2014;Miss Wynne went, and I was on the point of asking Sterling to go immediately, also, as I had a letter to finish, and besides; so much talking was increasing my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cuff</hi>.&#x201C; but he said he had come to &#x201C;consult&#x201C; me about &#x201C;what on earth he was to do&#x201C;&#x2014;his wife being still quite mad he thought, and the French Physician of opinion she would end in <hi rend="italic">permanent lunacy</hi>, and I felt it so unkind to stop him in the grave exposition of his affairs which he had entered on!&#x2014;still I was thinking all the while more of my letters than of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> troubles poor man, and was at last obliged to interrupt him with the question what o&#x2019;clock it was&#x2014;&#x201C;5 and 20 minutes to five&#x201C;&#x2014; I leapt up and sealed my letters and ordered <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to make all haste he could with them to Knightsbridge&#x2014;and he said he would&#x2014; But goodness knows if he would manage with them rightly This I will send by the night post anyhow&#x2014;to show that the omission&#x2014;if any&#x2014;was most involuntary&#x2014;for I had no idea of the lateness of the hour, every thing today having gone so late, thro&#x2019; that confounded Ball.</p>
<p>All yesterday I lay on the sofa&#x2014;seeing nobody except John for an hour in <pb id="pg-22-227" n="22:227"/>the evening. I was about to tell you some nonsense he said but the spirit is gone out of me <hi rend="italic">now</hi> for repeating nonsense.</p>
<p>The day before; I had gone into my own room to wash my hands after dining from a roasted <hi rend="italic">joint</hi>&#x2014;(one wing of a chicken roasted) (today I had a <hi rend="italic">boiled</hi> leg) when I heard a considerable pattering in the stairs, and Anne putting in her head with the look of a person who had good news to tell informed me Sir Harry and Lady Verney were in the Library. &#x201C;Oh dear!&#x201C; I said &#x201C;if you would only <hi rend="italic">ask</hi> me <hi rend="italic">whom</hi> I choose to receive&#x201C;? &#x201C;Have I blundered again&#x201C;? said the little woman&#x2014;&#x201C;I thought <hi rend="italic">the gentleman</hi> looked <hi rend="italic">nice</hi>&#x2014;and that you would like to have <hi rend="italic">him</hi> up.&#x201C; And so he did look &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">nice</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;ten years <hi rend="italic">younger</hi> than when I saw him last&#x2014;half the <hi rend="italic">starch</hi> out of him!&#x2014;and &#x201C;what shall I say&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">lively</hi>&#x2014;upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour&#x201C;!</p>
<p>I have heard no such hearty laughing as he laughed since <hi rend="italic">you</hi> went away&#x2014;the Lady too looked&#x2014;as well as she could&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">good</hi>, sensible, and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">most insipid</hi>&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380830-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:158</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1838-08-30">30 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; I suppose they are going to stay here now a while, for she said at going she &#x201C;hoped she would now see much more of me&#x201C;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">more</hi> might easily be&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">much</hi> more, not very likely. They made a prodigiously long stay; as I <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> afterwards to my cost and at such an odd time&#x2014;after the candles were lit in a winters night&#x2014;</p>
<p>They set to &#x201C;working it out of me&#x201C; about the Cromwell letters&#x2014; &#x201C;Pray M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle will you tell us what we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to believe about these letters of Cromwell&#x201C;?&#x2014;&#x201C;I suppose,&#x201C; I said, &#x201C;there will be nothing for it but just to <hi rend="italic">believe that you believe in them</hi>.&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">But</hi> said Sir H. &#x201C;I <hi rend="italic">cant understand</hi> &#x26;c&#x201C;&#x2014; a great deal he <hi rend="italic">could not understand</hi>, as it seemed, and I did not feel it <hi rend="italic">my</hi> business, especially &#x201C;with <hi rend="italic">my cough</hi>, and at <hi rend="italic">my time of life</hi>&#x201C; to furnish him with understanding. I am told that Landor says <hi rend="italic">he</hi> wrote the letters for a joke against Carlyle&#x2014;this comes from the Procter side of things, but fool as he is (practically) he would hardly I think indulge in so bad a jest. John is not coming tonight; since he got demoralized by the Watts he has found out that &#x201C;it is better perhaps I should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be read to&#x201C;&#x2014;I &#x201C;may sleep better for having been alone&#x201C;</p>
<p>I send the Books tonight to Stanhope Street&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wish I had kept to the idea you left me in&#x2014;to give up my visit altogether from the first In the weak state I am in all this hithering and thithering has been very hurtful to me, and must have been tiresome enough to &#x201C;others.&#x201C;</p>
<p>When Lady Harriet is <hi rend="italic">quite done</hi> with Sterling I should like to have it back<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. C. Hare&#x2019;s edn.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>Thanks for your note. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> desired me to send the Chapter on to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> and so I send it&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it will just have to travel back to her<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine Jewsbury.</note>&#x2014; This is worse than anything in Zoe, to my judgement; in fact perfectly disgusting for a young English woman to write&#x2014;and from Chapman&#x2019;s point of view quite &#x201C;unfit for circulation in families.&#x201C; I would not have such stuff <hi rend="italic">dedicated to me</hi>, as she proposed, for any number of guineas.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480226-JWC-JF-01">JWC to JF, [<date when="1848-03-26">26 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note> But I am done with counselling her, her tendency towards the unmentionable is too strong for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to stay it.</p>
<p>I am not going tomorrow after all&#x2014;nor any other day for the present. Tho&#x2019; suffering from the change of temperature to an extent that made such enterprise a considerable risk, I would still have forced myself to go had not a letter from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C this morning indicated a sudden wish that I would give it up&#x2014; and so leave <hi rend="italic">him</hi> free to come home himself immediately if he did not get rid of a cold which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has caught there&#x2014; &#x201C;An interesting family&#x201C; aint we? And my maid barks like a house-puppie&#x2014;and my kitten when I saw her last was running at the eyes&#x2014;</p>
<p>Perhaps you will go next week&#x2014;</p>

<p>We did not dine till 7&#xBD; last night, waiting for Senior; and I had had no lunch: was there ever anything more pathetic!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am deeply concerned to hear how just an excuse you have for your non-appearance here. Alas, we are all born to troubles, even as the sparks fly upwards:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 5:7. Childs wrote, <date when="1848-01-24">24 Jan.</date>, from Bungay, saying that his youngest son, sixteen years old, had died the past <date when="1847-07-00">July</date>, this being &#x201C;the Sixth blow in seven years, our only daughter amongst them.&#x201C;.</note> troubles that take the shape of sorrows, of affectionate grief, are, if the painfullest, yet the sacredest; and, as you say, we must not repine under them. A little while, and they will all have <hi rend="italic">ended</hi>.</p>
<p>Of the Cromwell Letters I do not find that I have anything more to say.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Childs asked, <date when="1848-01-24">24 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;Anent these 35 letter[s] in Fraser! what are we to say to them? Is there living in this realm of England a man, who, having in his possession such things, would commit them to the flames? That is the incredible point which puzzles me, &#x26; your expression alone of belief that the deed has been done gives it color of assurance in my mind. &#x2026; / Tell me, if you think fit, what I may say?&#x201C;.</note> I have already said, and publicly put my name to it, That I without shadow of hesitation believe them to be genuine; and that they came to me in such and such a way. To assert this a second time could not add to the credibility of it. The only reassertion I mean to make is that of introducing the Thirty-five Letters, as an Appendix, into any Third Edition I may live to see of that Book on Cromwell. This, unless quite other arguments than any I have yet heard of be adduced,&#x2014;indeed I may say, unless a <hi rend="italic">miracle</hi> could be proved to have befallen me,&#x2014;I shall without scruple do. For as to that poor stuff about modern phrases, &#x201C;cravats,&#x201C; &#x201C;stand no nonsenses&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c, I confess a whole cartload of it, against the other <hi rend="italic">in</hi>dubitable facts of the case, is worth simply nothing at all to me;&#x2014;means merely that one of the darkest, most ignorant, bewildered and impatient men in England has <hi rend="italic">miscopied</hi>; or else (which I consider far likelier hitherto) that such Critics do not in the least know what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> modern,&#x2014;and have an unrestrainable tendency to think and say and write things foolish and not wise! In fine the whole controversy seems to me inexpressibly idle; and I, for my share, have no interest in it at all.&#x2014; If you look in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> Newspaper of the <pb id="pg-22-232" n="22:232"/>week before last (to which add that of last week by way of corollary), you will find a very rational article on the subject; none other have I seen that is worthy of better than lighting one&#x2019;s pipe by the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s great Life is too serious and indeed sacred a subject with me to induce any jesting or poor hoaxing, as if indeed I had at all a tendency that way. Landor&#x2019;s Pamphlet itself, which I detected at the second sentence, was too afflictive to me to be read farther.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Childs had said: &#x201C;I wish the concoctors of the Rowley papers, the Shakspeare Scraps, &#x26; the cheerful conversation between Col Hampden &#x26; Col Cromwell would forge Bills of Exchange, or checks if it would suit them better, for the amount they look to make from the sale of their &#x2018;imaginary dialogues&#x2019; &#x26; then plain hopeful people might go quietly about their business, satisfied that the great facts delivered &#x26; acted by the &#x2018;Heroes&#x2019; of by gone days, were unimpeachable realities.&#x201C; W. S. Landor&#x2019;s &#x201C;Oliver Cromwell and Walter Noble&#x201C; had appeared in the first collection of <hi rend="italic">Imaginary Conversations</hi> (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>). His &#x201C;Oliver Cromwell and Sir Oliver Cromwell&#x201C; appeared in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> in <date when="1843-02-00">Feb. 1843</date> and was rptd. in his <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>). It is apparently to the latter dialogue that Childs and TC refer.</note> Oh what a set of long-eared mortals inhabit this world!</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You will cheerfully accept a small word from me, just to say how matters generally have gone with us. We got Isabella&#x2019;s Letter to John,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1848-01-19">19 Jan.</date></note> and were very thankful; it is our only news from Scotsbrig. We cannot but fancy you to be all suffering much from the cold there; but hope that the weaker of you, especially our poor Mother herself, are shrunk close into the warmest corner, and endeavouring to wear out the storm in expectation of better weather soon. Here it is a grey ringing frost; a strong Northeast wind often blowing, but no snow as yet.</p>
<p>Jane did not come to Alverstoke at all: she set two successive days, but her cold continued, and the stern weather continued; whereupon she gave up the enterprise. To my real satisfaction; for in the meanwhile I myself had contracted a cold, and taken to coughing; which with the multitudinous tumult of company and servants, and the obligation to go <hi rend="italic">out</hi> whenever I <hi rend="italic">smoked</hi>, I saw no chance of doing good with: therefore, on learning Jane&#x2019;s final resolve, I too decided to be off;&#x2014;and accordingly returned to Cheyne Row the day before yesterday; and have not crossed the threshold since. I have had two excellent nights of sleep; have fed myself as I liked, and sat smoking at my own ingle-nook; much more comfortable every way: and so my cold, this morning, is very considerably abated; and by means of wrappages I intend to venture out today for a walk; and in short I expect to be in my old way very soon. Poor Jane is a much weaker affair than I: but she too is getting sleep now; her cough is not deep or dangerous; so that, when the wild weather ends, we expect it also will end. Jack comes down faithfully every evening: he too, poor fellow, has got a kind of cold, which I suppose he will have to take to doctoring now, tho&#x2019; he does not much complain hitherto, and indeed it is yet only of some three days standing. Thus you see, dear Mother, we are none of us quite off the invalid list; yet none of us very deep in it;&#x2014;and certainly all well off in comparison with the generality, for I believe it has been the unhealthiest season anybody remembers for ten years back. Happily we expect it will soon end now.</p>
<p>So soon as my cold is quite gone, I have one or two bits of jobs that I must fall to. Not of much moment; but they will keep me going: a <hi rend="italic">big</hi> job lies <pb id="pg-22-234" n="22:234"/>deep in the background, not yet shaped into any form, but likely to be heavy enough when it comes!&#x2014; You see they are still firing away at these new Cromwell Letters: poor fellows!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Among others, the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1848-01-22">22 Jan.</date>, printed letters from W. Pollard asserting that the letters were &#x201C;authentic&#x201C; and from &#x201C;&#0394;&#x201C; saying that no anachronisms were involved. These were in answer to E. T. Blakely&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1848-01-15">15 Jan.</date>, and TC may have known of a critical letter by &#x201C;J.D.,&#x201C; written <date when="1848-01-22">22 Jan.</date> but not printed till <date when="1848-02-12">12 Feb.</date>, which criticized the arguments of &#x201C;&#0394;.&#x201C;.</note> I sit and say not a word, and care not a doit.&#x2014; If Isabella or some of them would write to us again? We bid you all keep within doors; and you, dear Mother, especially take care of yourself! I have a little Note to write to Jean at Dumfries,&#x2014;from whom I heard lately, all well,&#x2014;after which I am out for a rapid walk. <closer><salute>Good b&#x2019;ye, dear Mother: I will write soon again.

<p><salute>Dear Sister Jean,&#x2014;</salute>Take the hastiest of words from me; a mere indication of the lie of matters here. I came home on Monday. Jane never made out her expedition to Alverstoke; she appointed two successive days, then wisely gave it up altogether;&#x2014;wisely, for I myself had in the meanwhile got a cold; very unmanageable in such an establishment; so I packed up, and made off, and am here since Monday afternoon, as I say,&#x2014;close within doors ever since.&#x2014;&#x2014; My cold, now that I am at home, is of no moment, and indeed seems fairly departing; Jane&#x2019;s, which she can less bear, is not to call bad either; a cough troublesome but not dangerous; and we all believe it will go when the frost goes. But indeed our weather is very hard at present, grey grim skies, with strong Northeast wind occasionally; &#x201C;a ringing storm,&#x201C; as we say in Annandale; the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of the season, and the <hi rend="italic">last</hi>, we hope. Jack too has got a little cold; but one feels as if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could cure it when he liked. This, dear Jean, is the posture of affairs among us: no other news worth writing.</p>
<p>Among the idle people there goes on with considerable briskness a controversy about that poor Paper of Cromwell Letters in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>,&#x2014;as to Whether they are genuine or not? &#x201C;Gay idle of wark,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370304-JWC-JWE-01"><sic>9:161</sic><corr>JWC to JWE, <date when="1837-03-04">4 March 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> I think!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am much obliged by your intelligent and kind communication; of which I shall endeavour to make what use is possible.</p>
<p>The Letter about Lilburne (<date when="1650-03-08">8 March, 1650</date>&#x2013;<date when="1651-00-00">1</date>) has certainly escaped me:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Cromwell&#x2019;s letter concerning Robert Lilburne (<date when="1613-00-00">1613</date>&#x2013;<date when="1665-00-00">65</date>), parliamentary army officer, regicide, M.P. for the E Riding of Yorkshire, <date when="1656-00-00">1656</date>, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:290&#x2013;91.</note> if you will please to send me an exact copy (date, address &#x26;c with exact reference), I shall be very thankful, and do my best to turn it to account. Richard Pratt&#x2019;s Paper<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:270: &#x201C;Richard Pratt, &#x2018;who, as we are informed, is very poor and necessitous,&#x2019; a <hi rend="italic">Bedesman</hi> (small pensioner for life) of that [Trinity] College.&#x201C;.</note> and Colonel James&#x2019;s,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:332, where TC notes that the &#x201C;Original Commission, signed &#x2018;O. Cromwell,&#x2019; &#x2026; appointing &#x2018;Collonel John James&#x2019; Governor of Worcester, is now among the MSS. of Trin. Coll. Cambridge.&#x201C;.</note> tho&#x2019; of less consideration, would also be very welcome, if you could undertake the trouble of getting them copied. Pray mention also whether the Lilburne Letter is an original, and if there is any notice how it came into the Collector&#x2019;s hands.&#x2014; I have corrected the reference &#x201C;p. 495&#x201C; as you direct. There is no other <hi rend="italic">Baker</hi> that I know of but the one in your University; that is to say, part of the volumes are with you, and part in the British Museum here;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Baker (<date when="1656-00-00">1656</date>&#x2013;<date when="1740-00-00">1740</date>) collected 42 vols. of MSS relating to Cambridge Univ.; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460101-TC-CHC-01"><sic>20:89</sic><corr>TC to CHC, <date when="1846-01-01">1 Jan. 1846</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460117-TC-CHC-01"><sic>101</sic><corr>TC to CHC, <date when="1846-01-17">17 Jan. 1846</date></corr></ref>. TC gives the Baker MSS at Cambridge as his source for the letter about Lilburne.</note> I hardly know either of them except at second hand; but it has often struck me as a great pity that some intelligent Cambridge man did not go into the old volumes, and distil some result out of them, for the honour of his University and of England. It would require no small faculty both of writing and (what is far rarer) of forbearing to write; for there has much fallent obsolete, which one is bound to know, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to repeat: but by a brave man, not <pb id="pg-22-236" n="22:236"/>afraid of labour, capable of wise speech and of wise silence, it might be done.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edleston replied, <date when="1848-01-27">27 Jan.</date>, sending, &#x201C;as you request, copies of the three documents.&#x201C;.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept many thanks for the trouble you have taken with these Transcripts.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See previous letter.</note> The Lilburn Letter is decidedly worth preserving in print; and can still be illustrated a little, as I find.&#x2014; With regard to the Pratt Document, if you persist in your kind purpose of still consulting the original again, perhaps you could also ascertain whether there is any farther trace of Pratt before or after; and inform me what this of Bedesmanship specially was in your college, and in what form, if at all, it still is there. This quite at your leisure,&#x2014;for the document is otherwise not important.</p>
<p>I have heard no tidings of Sir Isaac Newton in this neighbourhood:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edleston wrote, <date when="1848-01-27">27 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I will take this opportunity of asking you whether you have heard any tradition relating to the house occupied by Sir I.

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x2014;</salute>I came home last week,&#x2014;driven by an ugly Cough and Cold, almost my only conquest in that expedition. My Wife never came at all; could not, for illness and the rigour of weather.&#x2014; And so here we are; much recovered now, I especially almost well;&#x2014;and very willing (after several days of a Silence as of Hades here) to see the face of an articulate-speaking friendly man! Of course we, that is both of us, or almost either of us,&#x2014;are never from home as times go.</p>
<p>I am reading poor Sterling&#x2019;s Book, with a strange, almost preternatural feeling,&#x2014;being <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> he yet speaketh:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heb.11:4. TC&#x2019;s copy of Sterling&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Essays and Tales</hi> (Widener Collection, Harvard Univ.) was used by Anne K. Tuell for her &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Marginalia in Sterling&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Essays and Tales</hi>,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">PMLA</hi> 54 (<date when="1939-00-00">1939</date>):815&#x2013;24. TC&#x2019;s comments, which she thinks were apparently made on a first careful reading, are generally critical of the ed. and in support of Sterling&#x2019;s independence in religious conviction. Remarking on Sterling&#x2019;s comment on Anglican narrowness, &#x201C;The Will has nothing to do with belief&#x201C; (2:114), TC wrote: &#x201C;It is indeed stupid.&#x201C; Other comments say of Sterling: &#x201C;This man must soon leave &#x2018;the Church&#x2019;&#x201C; (1:liv); while others are hostile to Coleridge. It was an attitude that was to lead to TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi> (<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), written partly to counter Hare.</note> ah me!</p>
<p>By a Newspaper this morning I find the Squire Controversy, &#x201C;intensely interesting,&#x201C; is still alive,&#x2014;in spite of the &#x201C;ingenious and able&#x201C; &#x26;c of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>. Well; who can help it? Squire, I suppose, will have to take his Cudgel, and break the back of an Editor or two: that will perhaps kill the Controversy!</p>

<p>Some twelve or thirteen years ago, there appeared in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> a Series of Papers on certain of the Criminal departments of London <pb id="pg-22-238" n="22:238"/>Society, Newgate Prisoners, Domestics in Great Houses, and the like; which distinguished themselves not only by the then novelty of such topics in Periodical Literature, but by a practical sagacity, gravity and solidity in the treatment of them, much rarer than mere command of literary mechanism is. To me the Papers seemed to merit unusual attention; and certainly, from at least one reader, they did obtain such. The Author of them, it appears, and of many other writings not well known to me, was Mr C. Wall, now an Applicant for some assistance from the Literary Fund.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Horace Wall (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), contributed several anonymous pieces to <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi>, <date when="1832-06-00">June 1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-12-00">Dec. 1844</date>. The Literary Fund awarded Wall &#xa3;20.</note></p>
<p>I have not had the pleasure of any personal acquaintance with Mr Wall, did not till quite recently know even his name as a writer; nor can I in the least judge of his claims on the Literary Fund, whose rules are also unknown to me: but, to the above extent, in favour of his Papers I can and must bear clear testimony; and shall be very glad if a humane action can be furthered thereby.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The records of the Royal Literary Fund show Wall&#x2019;s other sponsors as John Abraham Heraud (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13012"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), author and critic (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310824-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:362</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-24">24 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>); F.

<p><salute>Dear Mr. de Vere,&#x2014;</salute>You did not come to see me; but how can I severely reprimand you when you are otherwise so kind? Let me hope I shall be luckier next time you come across to us.</p>
<p>Many thanks for the Book;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">English Misrule and Irish Misdeeds</hi>, which dealt with matters that deeply concerned TC and brought him closer to De Vere. The latter was to write TC, <date when="1849-01-19">19 Jan. 1849</date>, saying that a mutual acquaintance was correct &#x201C;in thinking that I have been writing more books about &#x2018;Irish Misdeeds,&#x2019;&#x201C; since he had written a lengthy letter-pamphlet on the Irish poor law: &#x201C;The reason that you are not, as you say, in the vein of writing, is you may depend on it, because you have a debt to Ireland that lies heavy on your soul&#x2014;you evidently had a strong vocation to write on that subject; but you have been &#x2018;quenching the Spirit&#x2019;&#x2014; You will do a great good if you write a book on that subject &#x26; blow such a blast as will waken the sleepers&#x2014;but remember that Ireland has not been a nation growing its own destinies as a stag grows its horns, but a wretched, oppressed &#x26; divided Province or Colony, governed as extra &#x26; so be merciful in judgement as well as charitable in counsel&#x2014;&#x201C;.</note> which indeed is a gift I was much gratified with. I have read the eloquent performance with attention: part of it Milnes had already read aloud to us at Alverstoke, multifarious running-commentary accompanying him. Indisputably enough it is eloquent; has a chivalrous noble tone in it, which anywhere, and especially as coming from Ireland, it does us good to hear. For the rest, you anticipate rightly, I find much to dissent from; but, what is better news, there is also no passage, or hardly any, in the Book in which I do not find much to agree with. Yes, beyond doubt, there is good in Ireland that we know not; if Ireland consisted all of Hill-of-Tara meetings, of O&#x2019;Connell balderdash and rusty pistol shots and Machale letters,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John MacHale (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17528"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), archbishop of Tuam, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, opposed to everything English; pbd. a series of letters, from <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>, against mixed education of Roman Catholics and Protestants; perhaps the most popular public man in Ireland. An open letter to Lord John Russell, repbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1848-01-04">4 Jan.</date>, made him even better known. The Hill of Tara, in Meath, E Ireland, where kings, princes, clergy, and bards once conferred on public matters, was remembered as the scene of O&#x2019;Connell&#x2019;s largest Repeal meeting, <date when="1843-08-15">15 Aug. 1843</date>.</note> Ireland could not cohere at all; its pot, very languidly simmering of late, would long since have ceased to boil altogether. On the other hand, and this is my fundamental all-pervading objection, it seems to me of no use, when one has fallen into misfortune, to blame one&#x2019;s enemies, one&#x2019;s friends, one&#x2019;s government; or indeed any creature or entity whatever, till once one has thoroughly blamed (and amended) one&#x2019;s own poor self. Alas, my friend, the Government of Ireland, Saxon Government, with its bloody hoof, &#x26;c. &#x26;c., is precisely what <pb id="pg-22-240" n="22:240"/>the governments of other nations, and considerable provinces are and always were&#x2014;the concentrated <hi rend="italic">Practical Likeness</hi> of the Nation itself;&#x2014;natural to the Nation, as its own face is, as the hair of its own head, growing up out of the whole being and structure of it, rooted in its very heart, nourished by the inmost drop of its blood. For no Nation, I do believe, will or can long wear an adscititious face (a <hi rend="italic">mask</hi>), or submit to a tar <hi rend="italic">wig;</hi> no, it acquires such face and hair as <hi rend="italic">it</hi> can grow, and therewith walk abroad. Men, and Nations, do indeed fall among thieves, and are sadly maltreated and trampled out of shape; but a man, you will find, is generally responsible for his own face, and a Nation, I venture to assert, is always so. Let it not blame its government. The court of the Universe will hear no such plea from any Nation; let it, if insufferably ugly, say, &#x2018;I have deserved to be so.&#x2019; There is no hope otherwise, I believe, for any Nation or man. These you call cruel sayings, and turn a deaf, scornful ear to them; but perhaps you will not always do so. Depend upon it, there is sincerity in these sayings too;&#x2014;and much would it please me if a patriotic heart, of such insight and sense of truth as yours, offering an example to all such hearts, would look earnestly on that side of the question, and exhaust what of truth is in it. We will not despair under the given omens.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, what England wants and Ireland only a small degree <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, is that we should know, among our multitudinous populations, the units that are men and <hi rend="italic">free</hi>, and the millions that by Nature&#x2019;s own verdict are and remain <hi rend="italic">slaves</hi>,&#x2014;whom it is the cruellest injustice to call or treat by any other name, the whole universe standing ready to <hi rend="italic">contradict</hi>, and nullify with costs, all treatment of that kind.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr Baring,</salute>
<p>We are much concerned to hear of the poor Lady&#x2019;s new illness:&#x2014;all seems <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> at present, and nothing well; from Milan and the Kingdom of Naples<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Riots in Milan, <date when="1848-01-03">3 Jan.</date>, and a rising in Palermo, <date when="1848-01-12">12 Jan.</date>, stimulated Neapolitan liberals to action.</note> up to Chelsea and Alverstoke, the time, take it which way we will, is sick and out of joint;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 1.5.</note> all writing under <hi rend="italic">influenzas</hi> of various sad kinds, the cure of which is by no means apparent yet! For the bodily influenzas I <pb id="pg-22-241" n="22:241"/>hope the clear spring skies are at hand; for the others, I take it, the day of healing is still distant. If her Ladyship will take care of herself, we hope to see her in sunshine again before long,&#x2014;which element I take to be her native one; very unlike that of some other good British subjects!</p>
<p>Here we seem advancing towards recovery, yet at a very deliberate pace. I myself have never got entirely rid of that paltry cough; and have had to pass my days, ever since the Bear took me away that morning,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Ellice.</note> in a most self-secluded dim-lit abstruse condition. After all, it is &#x201C;the nature of the beast.&#x201C;&#x2014; Poor Mrs C. has got down stairs for the first time this morning; she proposes even to venture out, so mild is the temperature, if the sky would but shew itself <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> any day, as certainly it must some day.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She was evidently not down when Amalie B&#xF6;lte paid her usual Sun. visit, <date when="1848-02-06">6 Feb.</date>, and caught TC dozing on the sofa. He jumped up, she told Varnhagen, &#x201C;took a book from the writing table, pointed his finger at it silently, and looked meaningfully at me. We understood each other and both burst out in peals of laughter. It was &#x2018;Louise.&#x2019; He had brought it home from the London Library, and his look signified that he had caught me.&#x201C; B&#xF6;lte&#x2019;s novel was pbd. in London as <hi rend="italic">Louise; or the German Maiden in England</hi> and in Bautzen as <hi rend="italic">Louise, oder Die Deutsche in England</hi>. John Chorley reviewed it in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1848-02-26">26 Feb.</date> When she left TC was reading it eagerly. B&#xF6;lte also said that she told TC she would like to trans. <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, but he was afraid she &#x201C;would not do it well enough.&#x201C; Of JWC she said: &#x201C;For the first time it has occurred to her that women waste the best part of their lives seeking to please, if only she had realized that long ago! At present she is reading about emotional disorders and madness and is full of premonitions and dreams. But since she has decided that a useful life is the best protection against all that sort of thing, I have high hopes. It&#x2019;s amazing remaining a stranger for so long to all practical opinions on life at the side of such a man!&#x201C; (<foreign><hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi></foreign> 55&#x2013;56, trans.). A little later Espinasse wrote from 7 Harper St., Bloomsbury, offering to review B&#xF6;lte&#x2019;s novel: &#x201C;There are a great many Germans in Manchester, and very few amusing books coming out in London.&#x201C; She sent it to him, and it was duly reviewed in a local paper (MS: Jagiellonian Univ.).</note></p>
<p>I passed thro&#x2019; Stanhope Street yesterday; all stood composed, shut up as in decent casements of death or temporary-death.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Barings being not at their London home but at Alverstoke.</note> Croucher will wait for <hi rend="italic">Capefigue</hi> till you come.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A work by Jean Baptiste Honor&#xE9; Capefigue (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">72</date>), voluminous French author, journalist, and historian.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We are delighted with Isabella&#x2019;s last Letter, announcing to us that you are getting round again into your old way. We hope and trust the improvement continues. The Spring Sun will soon shine out, and do good to all weak creatures. We desire to be very thankful for what we have already heard, and will hope the next news too may be good.</p>
<p>Here all is on the way of recovery also, or already recovered. Jane has had a rather wearisome bout of it; never very ill; but feeble, coughing, and quite unable to front the bad season with any freedom. She got out of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> <pb id="pg-22-243" n="22:243"/><hi rend="italic">room</hi> about a week ago; went and had a short walk on the streets one day, as far as John&#x2019;s and back again, some days ago; but has never ventured out since, the weather, tho&#x2019; bright, having grown a little frosty. She stirs about the house now, and her cough is well nigh quite gone: if the sun were fairly on his feet, she too will be reestablished, I think. John has been very diligent in doctoring her; has come down almost every evening; was here last night, for a long time: his own cold went away again directly, and he has been well, and busy at his <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi>, all this time. I also am now getting pretty well; my dirty little insignificant cough lingered longer than I expected; a little while ago I had thoughts of a Burgundy-pitch plaster:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Made from a yellow resin of the spruce fir.</note> but it now seems as if the thing were about gone of itself, and as if I should not need that or any other remedy.&#x2014; I am getting very uneasy about new &#x201C;work&#x201C;; that is a greater grievance to me than any sickness I have! That too must have itself remedied, as I rally to buckle with it. I have a great heap of things to write; but on what hand to <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> is not clear: I must begin on some hand or other before long; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is now becoming clear to me.</p>
<p>We have heard nothing from Dumfries for a goodish while; indeed Isabella&#x2019;s Letter is our last out of the home quarter. I hope you have got your new <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>, well bound, from Dumfries; and that all is moderately well there.&#x2014; A Book consisting of my poor friend John Sterling&#x2019;s scattered writings has just come out; edited by one Julius Hare (an Archdeacon, soon to be a Bishop they say, a good man but rather a weak one);&#x2014;with a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of Sterling, which by no means contents me altogether. I think I shall send a Copy of the Book up to you, by and by; probably one of my first tasks will be something in response to this work of poor Sterling&#x2019;s,&#x2014;for he left it in charge to me too, and I surrendered my share of the task to the Archdeacon, being so busy with <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> at the time: but I am bound by very sacred considerations to keep a sharp eye over it, too; and will consider what can now be done.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude says: &#x201C;Emerson told me that in the summer of this year <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> he and Carlyle talked over this subject. They concluded that Sterling was too considerable a man to be set up as a &#x2018;theological cockshy,&#x2019; and that either Carlyle or he himself must write a true account of him&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:418n). In his Journal TC wrote, <date when="1848-02-08">8</date> or <date when="1848-02-09">9 Feb.</date>: <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Life and Essays of John Sterling</hi> out; have just been reading the whole: Life (by Hare) one of the poorest flimsinesses; Sterling&#x2019;s life all extinguished by the Shovelhat [i.e., his being Hare&#x2019;s curate after his ordination as a deacon]:&#x2014;he was a man for 39 years, a parson only for 8 months in all&#x2014;.&#x201C; Under &#x201C;Schemes of books to be now set about&#x201C; TC included in his Journal at this time: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling</hi>. I really must draw up some statement on that subject&#x2014;some Picture of a Gifted Soul whom I knew and who was my friend,&#x2014;might not many things withal be <hi rend="italic">taught</hi> in the course of such a delineation? Anthony Sterling is bustling about, affecting to collect Letters &#x26;c &#x26;c, and expects such a thing from me; but from him, or from others, no help will be got. Besides, so far as I see yet, it can only be a parergon,&#x2014;may come out as Review Article, or lie quiet till after I am not more here.&#x201C;.</note> Poor John Sterling was a noble creature, <pb id="pg-22-244" n="22:244"/>but had too little <hi rend="italic">patience</hi>, and indeed too thin and sick a constitution of <hi rend="italic">body</hi>, to turn his fine gifts to the best account.</p>
<p>The Parliament has come back, and the Town, especially our western quarter of it, is getting very loud with carriages and population again; but we hitherto have little to do with all that. There has been, as you might see, much vain controversy about a certain very useless &#x201C;Dr Hampden,&#x201C; and his being made a Bishop against the will of some: nothing could seem to me more entirely contemptible and deplorable than the whole figure of that thing has been.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Renn Dickson Hampden (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12171"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Oxford liberal theologian, had been abused by Tractarians ever since he gave the Bampton Lectures, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, and was accused of the heresy of Arianism. Notwithstanding the Tractarians&#x2019; vehement opposition, he was made principal of St. Mary Hall, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>, prof. of moral philosophy, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, and regius prof. of divinity, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>. His nomination as bishop of Hereford, <date when="1847-12-00">Dec. 1847</date>, again aroused violent, organized opposition. His consecration in <date when="1848-03-00">March</date> provoked a remonstrance by many bishops and opposition from the dean of Hereford.</note> Now they are for getting Jews into Parliament: for &#x201C;the Jew Bill&#x201C; too I would not give half a snuff of tobacco, for or against:&#x2014;we will leave that too, and much else, to fight its own battle.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The second reading in the House of Commons of the govt.&#x2019;s bill to remove Jewish disabilities had been carried, <date when="1848-02-07">7 Feb.</date>, and was to be rejected by the House of Lords on its second reading.</note> Of Emerson we hear nothing this while; but they say he is coming hither to lecture before long.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I must go out, and take a walk in the sun while it shines. Will not Isabella or some of them write us another word soon? Take care of yourself, dear Mother; do not venture out except in the sunshine. If I had not been so dark and abstruse of late days I would have written to you sooner. It shall not be so long till next time. <closer><salute>God bless you all!&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>This last is the only letter I have had from you for an age that I have felt a <foreign><hi rend="italic">besoin</hi></foreign> [need] to answer <hi rend="italic">at once</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie Welsh&#x2019;s letter was no doubt inspired by Mazzini, who wrote to her, <date when="1848-01-25">25 Jan.</date>, apparently in reply to one asking about JWC. He said: &#x201C;No; I do not think that you run the risk of being ever misinterpreted, by your cousin or others, provided you choose to show <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>. You really ought to write oftener and as warmly as of old to your cousin. Whatever she may show to you, she is apt to feel, and needs friendship more than ever.&#x201C; He also enclosed a circular for the Friends of Italy &#x26; National Independence, with details of a &#x201C;Penny-Subscription&#x201C; that &#x201C;some English ladies&#x201C; were promoting in aid of the fund, hoping that she &#x201C;fully and cordially&#x201C; sympathized with their cause (MS: NLS 2883.157).</note> I would have written yesterday had not <pb id="pg-22-245" n="22:245"/>my head been too bad for writing. Perhaps you wonder what was in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> letter to make it particularly acceptable&#x2014;but no&#x2014;you cannot but have an inward sense that it was <hi rend="italic">the real transcript of your mind at the moment</hi> which your letters have long ceased to be&#x2014; I have had letters of many sheets from you&#x2014;not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">stupid</hi>&#x201C; letters by any means&#x2014;as <hi rend="italic">kindly phrased</hi> too as I had any business to expect&#x2014;which I have nevertheless thrown into the fire the minute after reading them, with a feeling of the most profound disappointment and chagrin&#x2014;because they contained no one word that seemed to have come out of any deeper source than your ink bottle&#x2014;were not in fact letters from <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, but such as might stand labelled in <hi rend="italic">the Ready letter writer letter from a young Lady residing in the Country to a female cousin in Town</hi>&#x2014; Letters written <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to <hi rend="italic">communicate</hi> your real thoughts but to <hi rend="italic">conceal</hi> them&#x2014; And yet who is there who can understand all that is in your heart. even the saddest of it, and what you may feel to be the least creditable to you&#x2014;your discontents with yourself&#x2014;your circumstances &#x26;c so well as just I who have passed my whole existence in that sort of thing&#x2014;and to whom there is no sorrow in life no weakness in human nature that is not intelligible thro my own experience You may say my own letters are as little written out of the heart as yours&#x2014;certainly&#x2014;! I am very sensitive&#x2014;morbidly so&#x2014;and I can only be confidential where I am met by confidence&#x2014;besides <hi rend="italic">my</hi> inward life is connected with outward <hi rend="italic">facts</hi> on which I am bound to be silent&#x2014;so that I could not always let you see into my heart without exposing myself to cruel misconstructions.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amalie B&#xF6;lte&#x2019;s letter to Varnhagen, <date when="1848-02-07">7 Feb.</date>, confirms JWC&#x2019;s view of her sensitivity and gives reasons: &#x201C;I have now settled on Sunday evening for my visits there, really because I can be certain then to see very little of him. His humor is refreshing and stimulating. It&#x2019;s a pity that he isn&#x2019;t a little more human! Now she usually takes me aside for a little private conversation, that then turns from things to feelings, an area where we never meet, or seldom. She believes now that I love her best in all the world, and needing affection as she does, I want to do more for her than ever. I am reconciled to the idea that she isn&#x2019;t capable of anything at all&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi>, trans. 56).</note> Still were <hi rend="italic">you</hi> less shut up&#x2014;I should never have got so <hi rend="italic">inarticulate</hi> for you as I have long been&#x2014;</p>
<p>But it is a truth you say; friends <hi rend="italic">should</hi> see one another from time to time if they would go on understanding one another&#x2014; And yet&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> time we saw each other were we any better for it in the matter of understanding?</p>
<p>I wish we could carry <hi rend="italic">the Swizerland project</hi> into effect&#x2014;be together awhile somewhere quite far away from all interference&#x2014; I have got over the Alverstoke visit this year most unexpectedly&#x2014; We were to have gone the beginning of January for five or six weeks, but I fell ill&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">really</hi> ill just the <pb id="pg-22-246" n="22:246"/>night before&#x2014;and after waiting for me a few days C. went alone&#x2014;for a fortnight while confined to my bedroom with a dreadful cough and the usual accompaniments&#x2014;never getting a wink of sleep except by means of Morphia, I was every day written to &#x201C;when will you be well? When are you coming&#x201C;?&#x2014;and I fixed time after time, to oblige them&#x2014;which when arrived was found impossible&#x2014;at length I believe I should really have gone to be done with it&#x2014;ill as I was&#x2014;and <hi rend="small-caps">got</hi> <hi rend="italic">done with it</hi> once for all had not C., I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> say <hi rend="italic">happily</hi>, taken a cold <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, which he felt no hope to get rid of in a houseful of company with seven oclock dinners french beds &#x26;c and so he came home himself instead of insisting any longer on my going.</p>
<p>I am only got down stairs this week&#x2014;and am not good for much yet&#x2014;one very mild day (Tuesday I think) I walked out a little way&#x2014;as far as Johns who lives now in Hemus Terrace (if you remember such place&#x2014;close by here&#x2014;but since then it has been too cold for me besides I have been feeling more sensitive (from <hi rend="italic">female</hi> causes) John was very attentive to me both in this last illness and the one I had after my return from Yorkshire&#x2014; He is much <hi rend="italic">subsided</hi> and improved since he got his <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> under weigh&#x2014;especially in regard for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> he is singularly improved&#x2014; Yes I can see it all at Maryland Street&#x2014; <closer><salute>Give them my love a kiss most warm to my Uncle</salute></closer></p>

<p>A headach of two days standing is the reason I have not answered your note sooner.</p>

(with a <hi rend="italic">pump</hi> to fall back on of course) You should have <hi rend="italic">my</hi> custom to begin with&#x2014;not only from personal friendship; but that the individual whose has supplied me for ten years has got into the way of selling <hi rend="italic">a milk</hi> which consists two thirds of Thames-water and a pink-coloured powder, at the same time calling on &#x2018;his Maker,&#x2019;&#x2014;in one of whose dissenting churches he is an elder,&#x2014;&#x201C;to strike him dead if it be not precisely as it comes from <pb id="pg-22-247" n="22:247"/>the cow&#x201C;! You can consider about it and come and tell me. I am <hi rend="italic">visible</hi> now such as I am&#x2014; One day I even showed myself in the street for a few minutes but I am not <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> much yet. You would find me <hi rend="italic">clearest</hi> for taking a view of your complicated case, in the early part of the day&#x2014; Suppose you came here <hi rend="italic">to Church</hi> tomorrow.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>To satisfy myself on a small point of inquiry, not very important otherwise, I would gladly ascertain, To what Magazine of the year <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date> this stray leaf (entrusted me by a friend, to whom it is valuable) belongs?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See next letter.</note> Perhaps you, who are in the middle of such things, could without great difficulty find out?

<p>&#x201C;<date when="1789-11-00">Nov. 1789</date>,&#x201C; incidentally noted on the margin, as you will observe, considerably restricts the boundaries of the search. I do not imagine it can be the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>;&#x2014;nor indeed do I know how to guess at all.</p>
<p>Pray excuse this trouble; and be so kind, whether you succeed or not, as return me the leaf itself very soon, that I may restore it to its owner straightway.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr Strachey,</salute>
<p>Here is your Cromwellian leaf; and along with it a Letter by which you will perceive that my inquiry, as to what Magazine it had belonged to, has not been successful. That is not an important point; the date, <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>, being luckily marked on the leaf itself. Which date, I can observe farther, is also that of Brands <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi>y. <hi rend="italic">of Newcastle</hi> (London <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>), where this Letter, and <pb id="pg-22-248" n="22:248"/>another, and extracts from two more, all stand printed.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Brand (<date when="1744-00-00">1744</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>), <hi rend="italic">The History and Antiquities of &#x2026; Newcastle upon Tyne</hi> (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>) (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18290617-TC-HI-01"><sic>5:17</sic><corr>TC to HI, <date when="1829-06-17">17 June 1829</date></corr></ref>) 2:480&#x2013;81, 489.</note>The year is <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date> in Brand; and as the <hi rend="italic">month</hi> in your Magazine is &#x201C;<date when="1848-11-00">Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>,&#x201C; near upon the end of that year, I think we may reasonably guess that the Magazine has <hi rend="italic">copied</hi> from Brand; and, therefore, that old Bailiff Ormston <hi rend="italic">was</hi> in reality the saviour of that Letter, and of its three brethren, from the flames at Nosely Hall; a really remarkable service for an old unconscious gentleman to do!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Ormston, steward of the Haselrigs, and the letters from Cromwell to Sir Arthur Haselrig, see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 7:217&#x2013;20, 9:258&#x2013;60; and 21:207&#x2013;8. Noseley Hall, 11 mi. SE of Leicester, was the home of the Haselrigs.</note></p>
<p>There is only one point that puzzles me: Along with the Magazine leaf, it appears, Mr Hare was offered the <hi rend="italic">Original</hi> to purchase?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hare, prosperous Bristol manufacturer of floor coverings; m. <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>, Strachey&#x2019;s sister Jane (d. <date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>); see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430704-TC-JWC-01"><sic>16:229</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-07-04">4 July 1843</date></corr></ref>. The four letters had been privately printed the previous year by R. Ormston, of Newcastle, the old bailiff&#x2019;s grandson (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:258).</note>Whereas the undoubted Original with the three other Originals are now in the hands of Ormston jun<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, grandson of the old Bailiff; and do not seem to have ever been out of the household; or even known to exist there, in late years, till this Grandson quite recently searched them out! Which difficulty, indeed, is not of any <hi rend="italic">in</hi>trinsic importance at all; and may be solved by various hypotheses very near the surface.&#x2014; &#x2014; Such evidence as can be had seems all to point to the conclusion that is was old Ormston who saved this Dunbar Letter; and to him therefore we will be grateful,&#x2014;and close therewith this small investigation.</p>
<p>In sending back the Magazine-leaf, pray do not neglect to thank Mr Hare for his ready politeness in this as in all matters: many thanks to yourself also are due, and need not be expressed in words at present.</p>
<p>We have had somewhat to do with influenzas &#x26;c here; but are now pretty well recovered. Last Sunday your young Brother called,&#x2014;a most brisk stirring youngster!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably George Strachey (<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1912-00-00">1912</date>); see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440303-TC-GS-01"><sic>17:289</sic><corr>TC to GS, <date when="1844-03-03">3 March 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x2014;and gratified us, among other things, by the assurance that you at Clifton were all in a prospering condition.</p>

<p>Provided always it can be considered worthy of such loving labour as the investigation of it needs?

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Can you tell me where <hi rend="italic">Glorat</hi> is; and specially who &#x201C;the Sterlings of Glorat&#x201C; are or were, and how related to your House? My late friend, John Sterling, it appears, was of that &#x201C;Glorat&#x201C; branch; an Irish shoot, planted by a Gustavus-Adolphus soldier, who I suppose must have been a Cousin of yours; and I want to know a little how it was.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">The Life of John Sterling</hi> TC wrote of the founder of the family as Sir Robert Sterling, &#x201C;a Scottish Gustavus-Adolphus soldier&#x201C; of the civil war period, who called himself &#x201C;Sterling &#x2018;of Glorat&#x2019;; I believe, a younger branch of the well-known Stirlings of Keir in Stirlingshire&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:9). He also became gov. of Cork (see W. Fraser, <hi rend="italic">The Stirlings of Keir</hi> [Edinburgh, <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>] 159&#x2013;62), and was the great-grandson of William Striveling of Glorat and Law. John Sterling&#x2019;s family was descended from Robert&#x2019;s younger brother William; for information on that family, from Anthony Sterling, see Fraser 162&#x2013;64.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept many thanks for your communication; it contains various hints worthy of attention; the Dudley-Wyatt Letter will well deserve its place in the Appendix.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edleston wrote, <date when="1848-02-23">23 Feb.</date>, sending copies of Cromwell&#x2019;s letters to &#x201C;Dudley Watts&#x201C; and others and also providing information about the location of three Cromwell letters to &#x201C;Lord Wharton.&#x201C; For Cromwell&#x2019;s letter to Thomas Hill (d. <date when="1653-00-00">1653</date>), master of Trinity College, Cambridge, about Dudley Wyatt, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:294&#x2013;95.</note> Might I trouble still farther, a little, for some elucidations still wanting in regard to this and the other points.</p>
<p>1. Will you be so good as mention specially <hi rend="italic">where</hi> this Letter now exists. In Trin. Col. Library, or where? I fear there are no means of making out in whose hand the copy is:&#x2014;is the writing of &#x201C;Dr T. Hill&#x201C; himself known at all? Him naturally one guesses first. For the rest, I suppose there is no doubt about the &#x201C;L.<hi rend="small-caps">p</hi>.&#x201C; in the docket (not &#x201C;L.<hi rend="small-caps">g</hi>&#x201C;; L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Protector, <date when="1653-00-00">1653</date> not Lieut<hi rend="italic">t</hi> General); or of the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">S</hi>r&#x201C; (not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">M</hi>r&#x201C;) as applied to Wyatt?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC notes Trinity as the depository of &#x201C;&#x2018;a Transcript, Original now not forthcoming&#x2014;docketed in the hand of one Porter, &#x2026; about <date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>, <hi rend="italic">L. P. Cromwell&#x2019;s Letter concerning Sir Dudley Wyatt.</hi>&#x2019; (Communicated by the Rev. J. Edleston, Fellow of Trinity,<date when="1849-03-00">March 1849</date>).&#x201C;.</note> The latter query has importance; for if this is <hi rend="italic">Sir</hi> Dudley Wyatt, I should guess with some confidence that he is the <hi rend="italic">same man</hi> as Clarendon&#x2019;s Sir Dudley:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC cites Clarendon&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England</hi> 2:959, 3:22, etc.</note> a roving unrestful &#x201C;fellow&#x201C;; who seeing the Peace now come, wishes to get back to his College and revenues; but not succeeding there, and finding indeed that there is War coming again and endless scope for spyship and intrigue, devotes himself to that other branch of business.</p>
<p>2. In regard to Wharton&#x2019;s 3 Letters, will you specify the <hi rend="italic">designation</hi> of them in the <hi rend="italic">Fitzwilliam Catalogue</hi> (so that they could be <hi rend="italic">found</hi>, on asking);<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Cromwell&#x2019;s letters to Philip Wharton (<date when="1613-00-00">1613</date>&#x2013;<date when="1696-00-00">96</date>), 4th Baron Wharton, in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:106&#x2013;9, 224&#x2013;25, 323&#x2013;25. TC gives the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> as his source for these three letters, but in the third edn. he notes that the originals are now in the Fitzwilliam, having come there &#x201C;some thirty years ago; discovered &#x2018;among the Court-rolls of the Manor of Wymondham Cromwell, Norfolk.&#x2019;&#x201C;.</note> and get me an exact copy of the <hi rend="italic">Postscript</hi>, which, by the first <pb id="pg-22-252" n="22:252"/>opportunity, I will certainly insert in its place.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:109, where &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Postscript</hi> here is added from the Original.&#x201C;.</note> Perhaps you could mention also about what <hi rend="italic">year</hi> those Letters were discovered in Norfolk and came into the <hi rend="italic">F.</hi>m <hi rend="italic">Museum</hi>?</p>
<p>3. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">A festo Annunciationis</hi>&#x201C; &#x26;c is a welcome illumination to me of Noble&#x2019;s stupid darkness.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;From the Feast of the Annunciation&#x201C;: part of the heading of a list of scholars, including Cromwell, admitted to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in <date when="1616-00-00">1616</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:40. For Mark Noble, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Protectorate-House of Cromwell</hi>, see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450103-TC-CR-01"><sic>19:3</sic><corr>TC to CR, <date when="1845-01-03">3 Jan. 1845</date></corr></ref>.

Pray, if it is not too much trouble, could you count for me how many names precede Oliver&#x2019;s;&#x2014;or if that is too long a job, enable me to say generally &#x201C;a considerable way down,&#x201C; a &#x201C;short way,&#x201C; or otherwise, as the case may be. But I suppose (as Sidney Sussex is a small College), the counting will be the preferable plan.</p>
<p>The distance from Cambridge to Huntingdon (which I rode only once, with a thunderstorm chacing me on the horizon)<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1841-09-00">Sept. 1841</date>; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420906-TC-JOST-01"><sic>15:69</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1842-09-06">6 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420907-TC-MAC-01"><sic>73&#x2013;75</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1842-09-07">7 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420909-TC-JAC-01"><sic>81&#x2013;82</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1842-09-09">9 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> is rectified, I think, in the second edition; it, as well as the other particular you allude to, and several more: but there is no getting to an immaculate state even in that respect.</p>

Today I <pb id="pg-22-253" n="22:253"/>have a pretty <foreign><hi rend="italic">gouster</hi></foreign> [storm] of the Southwest wind and rain going on against my windows here, which it hits very fair, and with a sound really musical to me, there being snug fire, and no smoke but that of <hi rend="italic">tobacco</hi>, in the inside of the glass for me!&#x2014; Such weather is not the best for invalids; nevertheless we are getting or got well; Jane herself evidently improving, and able now to venture out for a short walk whenever the sun shines kindly. She otherwise altogether keeps the house. I for my own share am in my usual way again,&#x2014;and indeed, for one thing, have been <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> a good deal more during the last month than is usual with me. Jack, a busy man, and very cheerful, is in fine health, so far as we see or understand. He was here last night,&#x2014;full of talk about the French riots and what not.&#x2014; A strange business that of the French and their riots just now! Today I send you another <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, which carries the business a bit farther; nay yesterday there arrived a telegraphic express here, which is doubtless at Dumfries too by this time, That Louis Philippe <hi rend="italic">was deposed</hi>, and his little infant Grandson (&#x201C;Count of Paris&#x201C; so-called) appointed &#x201C;King&#x201C; in his stead, with a body of the hottest radicals and republicans for &#x201C;ministry&#x201C; round him;&#x2014;and in brief that Louis Philippe and his Queen &#x26;c &#x26;c were fairly on their travels, and had quitted Paris for good!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Throughout <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date> there had been outbursts against the constitutional monarchy of Louis Philippe (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>) by both the political left and right, demanding electoral reform and an end to parliamentary corruption. By the end of the year the king had a majority but faced a formidable opposition in parliament, while the national guard was demoralized. On <date when="1847-12-27">27 Dec.</date> the king opened parliament with a denunciation of those of &#x201C;blind and hostile passions&#x201C; who wished to destroy existing institutions. The opposition organized a large banquet and demonstration, <date when="1848-02-22">22 Feb.</date>, in protest, which the govt. tried to prohibit. Its firm stand, under the premier, Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Pierre Guillaume Guizot (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>), at first deterred opponents, but on the night of <date when="1848-02-21">21</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-02-22">22 Feb.</date> workers, students, and others rioted in Paris; barricades went up and fighting began. The king dismissed Guizot, but the violence continued, and by the morning of <date when="1848-02-24">24 Feb.</date> the revolutionaries controlled Paris. The king abdicated later in the day in favor of his grandson, Louis Philippe Albert d&#x2019;Orl&#xE9;ans (<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1894-00-00">94</date>), count of Paris; but the latter was ignored by a rump meeting of deputies infiltrated by rioters. A republic was proclaimed on the night of <date when="1848-02-24">24 Feb.</date> The royal family fled to England, where they landed, <date when="1848-03-03">3 March</date>.</note> This was the news last night; which of course will make a great noise, whatever quarter of the world it reaches. Poor old Louis Philippe! An old man now, and has not yet learned to be an honest man;&#x2014;he learns, or may learn, that the cunningest knavery will not serve one&#x2019;s turn either. I begin to be really sorry for him, poor old scoundrel; he has had much sorrow, toil and tribulation, all the way, these 74 years, as he came along hither; and <hi rend="italic">possesses</hi>, as it were, nothing at all at this time except physical food and clothes.&#x2014; Guizot, his minister, is much more despicable: a poor honourable Writer and teacher of the Public at one time; him, for a mess of pottage,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Traditional; from Gen. 25 in Matthew&#x2019;s Bible (<date when="1537-00-00">1537</date>).</note> they seduced from his honourable <pb id="pg-22-254" n="22:254"/>garret, and converted into a rich conspicuous Public Quack,&#x2014;and now his light is quite snuffed out, and even his life (I fancy) is exposed to risk. His Father died by the guillotine, an honest Protestant man; his old Mother (whom Thomas Erskine &#x26;c used to know) I hope is dead too,&#x2014;for this sight would be too hard for her!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Guizot&#x2019;s father was guillotined, <date when="1794-04-00">April 1794</date>, after which his mother, &#xc9;lisabeth-Sophie, b. Bonicel (<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), became responsible for the education and rearing of her son. She followed him into exile in England, where she died, <date when="1848-03-31">31 March</date>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Of late days I have begun to scribble a little,&#x2014;or rather to <hi rend="italic">try</hi> if I can scribble, and convince myself that I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi>! For that is about the whole length it has got to yet. No man ever found his <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> more entirely <hi rend="italic">out</hi> than I now do, which is very sorrowful: but only to be <hi rend="italic">mended</hi> by holding on.&#x2014; &#x2014; My dear Mother, take care of yourself in this wild time! I hope Jenny keeps you very <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>, and tries (as I know she will) to screen you well from all disturbance. Do you get right sleep? Too much walking, or too much talking either, will do you no good.&#x2014; Let somebody write to us very soon again; from us you shall hear directly. <closer><salute>All blessings on you all</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>It is too bad to plague you with &#x201C;a delicate embarrassment&#x201C; of mine, when you are overhead in &#x201C;earnest work&#x201C;&#x2014;but what can I do? if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> do not cut me out; my Husband will, at the least send me to Gehenna! and I would much rather not!</p>
<p>Geraldine writes to me this morning (our correspondence had been at a still-stand ever since that feast of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">meats</hi>&#x201C; and <hi rend="italic">love</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tobacco</hi>, at the Fornisari&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >La Fornisari is a notorious <foreign>prima donna</foreign>, who suffers after having given up her child for the sake of her career.

Well! for <hi rend="italic">the delicate embarrassment</hi>; she does not say anything about the <hi rend="italic">Dedication to Mrs Paulet and myself</hi> which her heart was much set on some months ago&#x2014;and which&#x2014;that is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> share <pb id="pg-22-255" n="22:255"/>in it&#x2014;I neither positively accorded to, nor positively declined at the time, meaning to revise the question when the book was <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> for being <hi rend="italic">dedicated</hi>, and to be guided by my Husbands authentic feelings in the matter&#x2014; Knowing his dislike to be connected in people&#x2019;s minds, by even the slightest spider-thread, with what he calls &#x201C;George Sandism and all that accursed sort of thing&#x201C; I was not at all sure that the <hi rend="italic">half-toleration</hi> he gave when asked about it would not be changed into <hi rend="italic">prohibition</hi> if he found it likely to be acted upon&#x2014; At the time I <hi rend="italic">sounded</hi> his feelings; the Book, I was able to assure him, contained nothing <hi rend="italic">questionable</hi>&#x2014; Can I say so now? If <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> of the last Chapters I read be left in it, not only would <hi rend="italic">he</hi> detest a dedication to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> wife but his wife herself would detest it<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The dedication of the novel is &#x201C;affectionately inscribed&#x201C; to JWC and Elizabeth Paulet. Like <hi rend="italic">Zoe</hi> it deals with themes that interested all three women, however reluctant JWC was to associate herself with them in public. The novel is concerned with the upbringing of &#x201C;respectable&#x201C; middle-class women that leaves them no more than &#x201C;grown children,&#x201C; and it urges the need for sound female education, purposive work, and self-fulfillment. As one character says, &#x201C;I am not a stickler for the &#x2018;rights of women.&#x2019; &#x2026; The rights they really do want [are] &#x2026; not to have their lives and souls frittered into a shape to meet the notion of a &#x2018;truly feminine character&#x2019;&#x201C; (2:32). In many other ways the novel may have come uncomfortably close to JWC&#x2019;s own situation. It was strongly influenced by George Sand, especially her <hi rend="italic">Consuelo</hi> (<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">43</date>), and by Mme de Sta&#xEB;l&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Corinne</hi> (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>); see Patricia Thompson, <hi rend="italic">George Sand and the Victorians</hi> (<date when="1977-00-00">1977</date>).</note>&#x2014; What I want <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to do is, if there <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a dedication to erase <hi rend="italic">my</hi> name and leave it all to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet and tell me that you have so done, and I will write to Geraldine an explanation of the fact&#x2014; If there be <hi rend="italic">no</hi> dedication, tell me all the same; and then I shall not need to hurt the poor little souls <hi rend="italic">sensibilities</hi>, by a premature refusal&#x2014; You see how I am situated&#x2014;wishing <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to give pain to Geraldine&#x2014;still less to give offence to my Husband and least of all to promnade myself as an &#x201C;emancipated&#x201C; woman&#x2014; I am still confined to the house&#x2014;weary work&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever affectionately yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>Since <hi rend="italic">you</hi> say there is no impropriety now in the book, it is all right and <pb id="pg-22-256" n="22:256"/>the Dedication may stand as it is&#x2014; I am very glad of this, for it would have cruelly pained Geraldine had I declined it, and yet you can quite understand that anything of the sort I read would have been most offensive to Carlyle. He does not <hi rend="italic">like</hi> yet <hi rend="italic">his</hi> name being on what he calls a George-Sand-novel, never did as I told Geraldine from the first&#x2014;but he does not <hi rend="italic">forbid</hi> after what you have said&#x2014;and that is enough. So off with the dedication to the Printer without more ado&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>We are delighted to hear of you again at first hand: our last traditions <pb id="pg-22-257" n="22:257"/>represented you at Edinburgh,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where, as well as lecturing in Glasgow, he gave four lectures in mid-<date when="1848-02-00">Feb.</date> After leaving Edinburgh, <date when="1848-02-21">21 Feb.</date>, he went to Dundee, Perth, and Paisley to complete his lecture tour of Scotland, <date when="1848-02-25">25 Feb.</date></note> and left the prospect of your return hither very vague. I have only time for one word tonight: to say that your room is standing vacant ever since you quitted it,&#x2014;ready to be lighted up with all manner of physical and moral <hi rend="italic">fires</hi> that the place will yield; and is in fact <hi rend="italic">your</hi> room, and expects to be accounted such. I know not specially what your operations in this quarter are to be; but whatever they are, or the arrangements necessary for them, surely it is here that you must alight again in the big Babel, and deliberately adjust what farther is to be done. Write to us what day you are to arrive; and the rest is all already managed.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson replied from Manchester, <date when="1848-03-02">2 March</date>, suggesting that he come to dinner with them on Fri., <date when="1848-03-03">3 March</date>. He was to stay with John Chapman, 142 Strand.</note></p>
<p>Jane has never yet got out since the cold took her; but she has at no time been so ill as is frequent with her in these winter disorders; she is now steadily improving, and we expect will come out with the Sun and the green leaves,&#x2014;as she usually does. I too caught an ugly cold, and, what is very uncommon with me, a kind of cough, while down in Hampshire; which, with other inarticulate matters, has kept me in a very mute abstruse condition all this while; so that, for many weeks past, I have properly had no history,&#x2014;except such as trees in winter, and other merely passive objects may have. That is not an agreeable side of the page;&#x2014;but I find it indissolubly attached to the other: no historical leaf with me but has them <hi rend="italic">both</hi>! Reading does next to nothing for me at present, neither will thinking or even dreaming rightly prosper; of no province can I be quite master except of the <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> one, in such a case. One feels there, at last, as if quite annihilated; and takes up arms again (the poor goose-quill is no great things of a weapon to arm with!) as if in a kind of sacred despair.</p>
<p>All people are in a sort of joy-dance over the new French Republic, which has descended suddenly (or shall we say, <hi rend="italic">ascended</hi>, alas?) out of the Immensities upon us; shewing once again that the righteous Gods do yet live and reign! It is long years since I have felt any such deep-seated pious satisfaction at a public event.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After dining with the Carlyles, Emerson reported to his wife TC&#x2019;s enthusiasm for the recent French revolution and his taking &#x201C;for the first time in his life &#x2026; the Times newspaper daily&#x201C; (Rusk 4:34).</note> <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>: come soon; and warn us when.

<p>Of Squire I have heard little; his face I have never yet seen. During the heat of that distracted jargon about the Letters (more distracted jargon never came my way before), I sent, one day, three clippings of Newspapers which I had got somewhere, openly calling in question the authenticity of the Squire story and documents: these three clippings I enclosed in an empty cover, merely writing &#x201C;compliments&#x201C; in the inside, and despatched them to Yarmouth. Answer, next day, arrived;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480107-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1848-01-07">7 Jan.</date></ref></note> written as if by a wild lion, or <hi rend="italic">body</hi> of lions, several writing at once;&#x2014;really an affecting Letter, for poor Squire was ill of influenza, and his whole soul was stirred up into astonishment, contempt, and rage literally beyond speech. I saw it would have been easy to bring him up to any <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> Editor in London, with a tremendous oak stick in his hand, and a kind of &#x201C;logic&#x201C; that would have much surprised the negative Editor! But in fact I was afraid of Bedlam itself for poor Squire, and was filled with respect and pity for him; wrote accordingly a soothing letter, advising him not to mind a whit all that barking of street dogs, but to sit quiet, to grow well, and come and see me,&#x2014;which last he promised to do, but has never yet done; nor have I heard a whisper of him since.&#x2014; Yet I must see him by and by, should I even go to Yarmouth on purpose. You are much mistaken in your notion of what <pb id="pg-22-259" n="22:259"/>he thinks of you, &#x201C;my intelligent friend;&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> article TC had referred to FitzGerald anonymously as &#x201C;an intelligent Friend, partly acquainted in my Correspondent&#x2019;s [Squire&#x2019;s] country&#x201C; (633). To a friend, FitzGerald wrote, <date when="1848-01-13">13 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I suppose you have seen Carlyle&#x2019;s thirty-five Cromwell letters in Fraser. I see the Athenaeum is picking holes with them too; and I certainly had a misgiving that Squire of Yarmouth must have pieced out the <hi rend="italic">erosions</hi> of &#x2018;the vermin&#x2019; by one or two hot-headed guesses of his own. But I am sure, both from the general matter of the letters, and from Squire&#x2019;s own bodily presence, that he did not forge them. Carlyle has made a bungle of the whole business; and is fairly twitted by the Athenaeum for talking so loud about his veneration for Cromwell, etc., and yet not stirring himself to travel a hundred miles to see and save such memorials as he talks of&#x201C; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:592).</note>&#x2014;and if you ever come into his neighbourhood, you may with perfect frankness (and really I think, should) go and pay your respects to him again. You can say I never for one moment doubted of his letters; nor am likely, till the age of miracles come back. As to &#x2018;arguments&#x2019; like those we had from the negative Editors, I do not see that a mountain of such (mostly false and ignorant even as philologies) are of any weight at all. Besides, what boots it? Let every man believe as he lists; there is properly not a pennyworth of historical value attached to belief or to disbelief! It is literally like the noise of street dogs: one dog barks, another and another takes up the bark, and soon all the parish, and all the nation, is in full bow-wow, barking as for life;&#x2014;and the whole matter was a poor cracked porringer the cook was flinging out of window in the silent winter evening! You cannot stop it; not you, by rushing out with horsewhips, and field artillery of Woolwich arsenal: sit still in silence; and it will stop of itself!&#x2014; Spedding tells me, it is mostly quenched now, into a sober doubt on the part of the ignorant looking into a millstone; most people of sense, I believe, are content to take the matter as I give it. And so, till next edition, it must lie &#x2026; .</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I certainly owe you a Letter, some note of my existence and continued remembrance of you: so in spite of considerable hurry, here goes a word to you. I suppose my hurry, great as it is, cannot readily press heavier on me than yours on you when you take pen in hand. Thanks that you nevertheless do so; your Letters are our chief Annandale history at present, and form a great resource to us.</p>
<p>We are in our usual way of health here; all but Jane, who still continues mostly prisoner within doors, has taken breakfast in bed these six weeks or more, and really has no strength to spare. She sleeps very indifferently; that, I think, is her worst suffering at present; for the cough is very much gone, and she is sharp enough, and takes a full management of her affairs, enjoys company of people that come to see her, and so on:&#x2014;in short we <pb id="pg-22-262" n="22:262"/>wait for the <hi rend="italic">sun&#x2019;s</hi> coming out, that she too may make her appearance in public again. But our weather is full of mud and of frost; more rain by far than is common here, and perpetual sudden changes into bitter frosty Northwind, which again changes to South and West with new puddles: very bad weather for all thinskinned creatures. The way our dear old Mother seems to stand it, is wonderful; and surely will be counted a blessing by all of us.</p>
<p>My Mother&#x2019;s Newspaper was sent to you yesterday; because there was a &#x201C;bit Article&#x201C; on Louis Philippe in it by me. The Editor (one Forster now) came almost down on his knees to me for it; and then, my hand once being in, I wrote him a second, for which also he was passionately thankful in prospect: but, alas, when the article itself <hi rend="italic">came</hi> (&#x201C;French Republic,&#x201C; is headed), there was a sad hitch in it! In fact I had better send you F.&#x2019;s little note, which may amuse you for a moment,&#x2014;and then pray <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> it immediately. The result is, the Article (an utterly insignificant one, and with the dangerous passage cut out) will appear next week:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was typeset but not printed. The MS and proofs are in FC; extracts are printed in Michael Goldberg, &#x201C;&#x2018;Prospects of the French Republic,&#x2019;&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Newsletter</hi> 4 (1983): 20&#x2013;21. There were several reasons why Forster did not use it. One is that the dangerous passage may have been the expressed hope that &#x201C;the labour question can at least be attempted in peace, with a practical spirit&#x201C;; another that on <date when="1848-03-06">6 March</date> violent riots broke out in London, Glasgow, and elsewhere, dampening the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>&#x2019;s liking for TC&#x2019;s fervor; and, thirdly, that Fonblanque had retired on receiving a post in the board of trade and may have felt obliged to temper any radicalism and support the Whig govt.</note> and there, I fancy, my <hi rend="italic">Journalising</hi> ends, for the present. I have plenty of things <hi rend="italic">to say</hi>,&#x2014;with a vengeance!&#x2014;and have more than once thought of yielding to this Editor&#x2019;s solicitation, &#x201C;that I would write <hi rend="small-caps">any</hi>thing, any thing whatsoever!&#x201C;&#x2014;but, alas, he does not know <hi rend="italic">what</hi> he is inviting to write. I told him, it was suffic<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to blow up any British Newspaper in existence, to set me firing cannonades in it. Better, I suppose, to write it, tho&#x2019; with more trouble, all down in a Book?&#x2014; &#x2014; We are immensely delighted, all and sundry in these parts, and thanking Heaven, each in his way, that the old scoundrel Louis Philippe has been packed about his business. Sent flying, he and his, like a King <hi rend="italic">Crispin</hi> and his shoemaker <hi rend="italic">Dukes</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Crispin with his brother Crispianus, members of a noble Roman family, fled to Soissons in Gaul and as Christian missionaries supported themselves by making shoes. Said to have been beheaded (or thrown into a cauldron of molten lead), ca. 287, by the Emperor Maximian, they became the patron saints of shoemakers.</note>&#x2014;like a pack of coiners when the police comes suddenly on them! All men and all Nations rejoice at it; for certainly anything whatever was an improvement compared with that. Guizot has got hither too,&#x2014;his poor old Mother, now near 90, is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> here but has been left behind: nobody will meddle with her, poor old woman.</p>
<p>I send you today a Copy of Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine; one of the silliest of <pb id="pg-22-263" n="22:263"/>Magazines (I fear,&#x2014;for indeed I have not read it); but 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> will carry it: perhaps my Mother may find something to read in it.</p>
<p>I am engaged <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> this week to dine; which will do very little for me, I know! Then again on Saturday come a week; but that is &#x201C;to meet Sir R. Peel,&#x201C; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was worth doing once.&#x2014; &#x2014; Dear Jean, write to me again: take care of Mother, our good old Mother, and don&#x2019;t let her be tattered about! Say, I will write to herself very soon. You too have a Problem before you; be canny, lass!&#x2014; <closer><salute>My kind love to James, to Sister Jenny and all the <foreign>bairns</foreign> &#x26; parents. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>.</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Sir</salute>
<p>If I plague you by the request or question I have to ask; blame my Husband; for it was he who put me <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> it.</p>
<p>Have you any employment no matter how trifling, in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> business, that you could give to an honest, sober, industrious, not unintelligent, and positively starving man?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> Such a one is living within a stone cast of us, and if some <foreign><hi rend="italic">Deus ex machina</hi></foreign> do not save him, he and his wife and two little children must die outright, or go on the Parish or the Streets where it were a thousand pities to let them go; after having born the extremest privations rather than have recourse to either public or private charity. I have known about them for many years, and am <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> their actual state of destitution has not been produced by any extravagance or fault of their own, but simply by the hard times.</p>
<p>The man was a Gentleman&#x2019;s servant&#x2014;seven years in his last place&#x2014;where he married the house maid&#x2014;the two having saved a small purse of money between them&#x2014;with that, he paid a hairdresser to instruct him in making up hair, and then <hi rend="italic">set up</hi> in that business, and his wife sewed for servants and poor people, and they kept their heads above water. But for the last year the people who bought his hair in the country towns, where he went with it once a month, buy it no longer&#x2014;having no money to spare <pb id="pg-22-264" n="22:264"/>for artificial <hi rend="italic">good looks</hi>, and the poor people who had their gowns &#x26;c made by the wife are driven by &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Mother of Invention</hi>&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Necessity.</note> to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> for themselves&#x2014;and so&#x2014;!&#x2014; I have tried to get the man <hi rend="italic">a place</hi> in his old line, but his having been ten years out of service is an insuperable objection&#x2014;and one Lady who sets up for being &#x201C;very benevolent&#x201C; could not think of engaging him on account of &#x201C;his pale sickly looks&#x201C; (the consequence of care and bad feeding) He answers Times Advertisements of all sorts, and with no other result than wearing his shoes.</p>
<p>When I was lamenting about him yesterday; Carlyle said, he wondered if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> could not give some work&#x2014;and I thought it could at least do no harm to ask you.</p>
<p>Mr C. bids me say he would very much like the seal<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480324-TC-JCHI-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCHI</corr>, <date when="1848-03-24">24 March</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;he is working very hard just now at finding out&#x2014;what to work at!</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>We are very glad to hear of you again,&#x2014;still struggling and toiling, as we have all to do, but shewing a healthy courageous heart to your difficulties, as only a few of us can do. The late times, for all men in business, whether high or low, have indeed been frightful:&#x2014;the natural result, as I consider, of our universal frantic haste to become rich; of our worship of King Hudson, and other such Divinities; whom may the Devil soon put in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> pocket, and let us try some other!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Hudson. Adams&#x2019;s railway manufacturing plant at Bow failed.</note></p>
<p>Louis-Philippe has gone out not like a King, but like a felon Coiner surprised by the Police,&#x2014;with such exquisite ignominy as no King before him ran away under. <hi rend="italic">Bon voyage</hi>, we will all cry after him; and rejoice in the righteous decrees of Heaven.&#x2014; I consider this new Republic, whatever may become of it, an immense fact: both because Royalty is gone without return, and there is thus one <hi rend="italic">phantasm</hi> less in our poor distracted world, all bewildered and nearly driven mad with such; and also because this new French Government, and all Governments that can succeed it, <hi rend="italic">must</hi> actually <pb id="pg-22-265" n="22:265"/>attack the &#x201C;Labour Question,&#x201C; and either do something in it, or be blown in pieces, one after the other; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> grand &#x201C;Question,&#x201C; when it gets across the water to ourselves, as it of course must soon do, and men begin to look seriously (with <hi rend="italic">life-and-death feeling</hi>) what they <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do in it,&#x2014;is certain, as I think, to dissipate our &#x201C;universe of cant,&#x201C; at an amazingly accelerated rate. If you do want men to <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, to be taught and guided how to <hi rend="italic">work together</hi>,&#x2014;what continents of baleful nonsense will you not find necessary to annihilate first! Let us cheerfully accept the message of the Destinies; they give us good, as well as evil, and are just always.</p>
<p>My Wife is equally with Mrs Adams an invalid this long while;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Flower Adams (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">48</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/129"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410307-TC-HTA-01"><sic>13:50</sic><corr>TC to HTA, <date when="1841-03-07">7 March 1841</date></corr></ref>), poet and hymn writer, had been in ill health for some time and was to die in <date when="1848-08-00">Aug.</date></note> has hardly been across the threshold, I think, since soon after Newyearsday&#x2014;unlucky they in this world, whose skins are too <hi rend="italic">thin</hi>!

<p>I do not get beyond Pall-Mall and the Piccadilly region once in six months but I purpose before long to grow more excursive; and certainly the first time I pass near, shall not forget the friendly citadel in the Adelphi.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A group of houses on the bank of the Thames, in the region of the Strand, where the Adamses lived at 1 Adam St.</note></p>

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>I am afraid it is long past the time when I should have sent old Mary&#x2019;s money.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Mills. For JWC&#x2019;s concern for her, see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430501-JWC-MR-01"><sic>16:146</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1843-05-01">1 May 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> And there is no excuse for my having neglected <hi rend="italic">that</hi> duty, as it required no <hi rend="italic">exertion</hi> but <hi rend="italic">only</hi> a little <hi rend="italic">thought</hi>. Any thing needing exertion I have indeed been little <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> latterly&#x2014; When I wrote to you at newyeartime; I boasted of having kept well, for a wonder, while every-body about me had been laid up with influenza or some such thing, but no good ever comes of crowing before one is out of the wood! Just the day before we were to have started on the visit I told you of,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Alverstoke.</note> after all our portmanteaus were packed, and the house partially pulled in pieces; I took a sore throat which developed itself during a sleepless night into as serious a cold as anyone could have wished <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to have&#x2014;I could not quit my bed, never to speak of travelling. My Husband waited a few days to see me over the worst, and then went by himself, expecting I should be able to follow in a week or so&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">wildly</hi> romantic hope on his part after all he had seen of my <hi rend="italic">colds</hi>! Ever since; that is for two months, I have been closely confined to the house, toiling on with morphia and mustard blisters and all sorts of unpleasantnesses&#x2014;I have never however felt so dreadfully <hi rend="italic">weak</hi> this winter as I did the last, which my Brother-in-law imputes to his superior doctoring. Last winter I had so much opium and tartar emetic given me, which John says was &#x201C;very little better than arsenic&#x201C; for a person of my constitution. I have also been free this time from all household worry; my little maid, being quite able to keep things going on comfortably without my interference, and very quiet and attentive to me besides. So on the whole I have great cause of thankfulness that it has been no worse&#x2014; As my cough is now much abated, I mean to go out so soon as it is a little warmer. Confinement <hi rend="italic">does</hi> depress one&#x2019;s spirits do what one will!</p>
<p>You too were laid up when D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell wrote&#x2014;I hope you are now quite <pb id="pg-22-267" n="22:267"/>strong again. I meant to have written as soon as I had settled myself at Alverstoke, to ask more news of you&#x2014;but after I fell ill myself writing was for a long time dreadfully fatiguing to me&#x2014;and when I got a little stronger I persuaded myself that, by then your illness had gone to <hi rend="italic">the things past</hi>. Let me have a few lines now&#x2014;I want much to hear how old Mary and Margaret<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hiddlestone.</note> have got thro this sickly winter.

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>I dare say, by a little exertion of your influence you could get Emerson <pb id="pg-22-268" n="22:268"/>admitted, upon the footing of a &#x201C;distinguished stranger,&#x201C; to have access to the Athenaeum during his stay here?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Athenaeum is a club in Pall Mall, founded, <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>, for &#x201C;scientific and literary men and Artists.&#x201C; Milnes, Lord Morpeth, and others saw to Emerson&#x2019;s election as an honorary member for the term of his visit.</note> It would be very kind, fit, and hospitable in you to do so. E. is perfectly a &#x201C;gentleman,&#x201C; and what is still more interesting, of the American type (a rare species, I think!): a man produceable in any society, and whom it will not be disgraceful but honourable to recommend.</p>
<p>Pray think of this, like a good fellow as you are,&#x2014;and tell Emerson that it is <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, on Tuesday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> when you see him at Bancroft&#x2019;s;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1848-03-14">14 March</date>. Emerson had arrived in London, <date when="1848-03-02">2 March</date>.

Emerson had also attended a dinner where TC was not present and where the Squire papers were discussed and &#x201C;the external evidences of their being forgeries. Macaulay overcame everybody at the table &#x2026; by pouring out with victorious volubility instances of the use of words in a different meaning from that they bore in Cromwell&#x2019;s time&#x201C; (Alexander Ireland, <hi rend="italic">Ralph Waldo Emerson: His Life, Genius, and Writings</hi> [2d edn.; London, <date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>] 170&#x2013;71n).</note> for I know he wants it, and will take it as a real kindness of you. For the rest, he knows nothing of this project; having only asked me to introduce him to some such thing as the Reading Room of the London Library, which I had to tell him was not possible.</p>
<p>Finally if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> cannot do what I suggest, tell me to whom else I can apply.</p>
<p>If you are doing nothing on Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, I rather think Emerson will be <hi rend="italic">here</hi>;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Writing to his wife, ca. <date when="1848-03-13">13 March</date>, he said: &#x201C;I had a good talk with Carlyle last night. He says over &#x26; over for months for years, the same thing, yet his guiding genius is his moral sense, his perception of the sole importance of truth &#x26; justice. And he too says that there is properly no religion in England. He is quite contemptuous about <foreign>Kunst</foreign> [art] also in Germans or Eng. or Americans. And a great respect for Duke Wellington as the only Englishman or only one in the aristocracy who will have nothing to do with lies&#x201C; (Rusk 4:39&#x2013;40). See also Emerson&#x2019;s London journal for his remarks about TC, which amplify the observations in this letter and which seem to have been entered about the same time (<hi rend="italic">Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks</hi> 10:230&#x2013;34).</note>&#x2014;but you, I suppose, are comforting Louis-Philippe, or studying the stupendous spectacle of Jupiter de Lamartine, and have little leisure for sublunary matters!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes made his first visit, <date when="1848-03-22">22 March</date>, to the French king and queen at Claremont, which Queen Victoria had made available to them (J.

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>Had this last note been <hi rend="italic">from myself</hi>, it would have boded a violent headach just coming on, that feeling of vague impatience and restlessness, and that <hi rend="italic">straining</hi> of the heart after objects out of it&#x2019;s immediate circle&#x2014;after the Past and the Distant&#x2014;is a sure sign with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> of some approaching convulsion of my nervous system&#x2014;and yet one is thankful for such moments even at the cost of bodily pain! they at least prove to one that one &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">yet lives</hi>&#x201C;! a fact which is apt to become dubious for oneself, if not so for others, in certain helpless hopeless moods one gets into&#x2014;and which both you and I, it strikes me, are more apt to indulge in than the generality of women. But it is <hi rend="italic">just then</hi> that a letter <hi rend="italic">means something</hi>, and is really welcome and precious&#x2014; Such an &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">unsatis</hi>factory scrap&#x201C; as you call your <hi rend="italic">last</hi> is worth a dozen of the three-sheets-of-note-paper-letters I usually get <pb id="pg-22-271" n="22:271"/>from you&#x2014;which are filled with all the anythings or nothings you can <hi rend="italic">clutch out of the air</hi>, so to speak&#x2014;to conceal under multitudinous words, the deficiency of <hi rend="italic">one word out of Babbies own heart</hi>, which <hi rend="italic">my</hi> heart would need and look for. Write me always <hi rend="italic">such scraps</hi>&#x2014;write to me when you are sad&#x2014;when you are out of humour&#x2014;when the Devil is in you, if you like&#x2014; I love you all the same whatever is <hi rend="italic">in</hi> you&#x2014;whatever you tell me <hi rend="italic">out of yourself</hi> finds comprehension and sympathy from me&#x2014;but what you tell me &#x201C;out of the air&#x201C;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> enrages me&#x2014;I feel as tho&#x2019; having been a-thirst you had given me to drink the&#x2014; &#x2014;contents of your ink-bottle! So mind this Babbie! <hi rend="italic">do</hi> not henceforth wait for a convenient season to write me a long elaborated letter of news and &#x201C;all that sort of thing&#x201C;&#x2014;seize the moment of &#x201C;real, genuine, authentic&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">inclination</hi> as it flies<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Samuel Johnson, &#x201C;Winter.&#x201C;.</note>&#x2014;if a thought comes into your head that you would like to impart to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> rather than to any other&#x2014;if a sadness, or a longing, or a perplexity, or a <hi rend="italic">bedeviledness</hi> falls on you that you think <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could sympathize with better than any other (and what of that sort has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> experience taught me sympathy for?) then down with it on paper&#x2014;tho&#x2019; only six lines or six words&#x2014;send it off to me&#x2014;(we live under a penny-post &#x201C;than<hi rend="small-caps">ks</hi> God&#x201C;!) and you will see that our correspondence will <hi rend="italic">right itself</hi> again &#x26; that we will both get <hi rend="italic">to write</hi> to one another and <hi rend="italic">to be</hi> to one another as in bygone better years.&#x2014; One thing more about writing before I quit the subject&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">beautiful hand</hi>&#x2014;is not requisite between friends&#x2014;does not enhance the value of letters of friendship&#x2014;but if you <hi rend="italic">would</hi> dear Babbie just give heed enough to your <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> that it may not become <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">illegible</hi> (!) I assure you I have to read your letters like <hi rend="italic">greek</hi> and it is dreadfully aggravating in a letter like your last, so free-flowing and straight out of the heart, as to the sense; to be stuck up for five minutes together over <hi rend="italic">whole lines</hi> every now and then not one word of which will disclose itself on first inspection. I think the chief fault (for I really speak with a serious practical view) lies in your neglecting to <hi rend="italic">join</hi> your letters so that one never knows how many of them go to one word. and then as to giving <hi rend="italic">loops</hi> to your <hi rend="italic">es</hi> or any more than <hi rend="italic">one</hi> side of a <hi rend="italic">g, o</hi>, &#x26;c <hi rend="italic">that</hi> you never dream of&#x2014; Could you ever guess, for example unless you had made it yourself that the following word <figure><graphic url="volume-22-271-02.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure> stood for &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">only</hi>&#x201C; and this <figure><graphic url="volume-22-271-03.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure> for &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">get</hi>&#x201C;? Here is a long word <figure><graphic url="volume-22-271-04.gif"/><p></p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC cut out these words from Jeannie Welsh&#x2019;s letter and pasted them on hers.</note> that were I told with a loaded pistol at my breast to say it or die&#x2014;I should have to <hi rend="italic">die</hi> <pb id="pg-22-272" n="22:272"/>&#x201C;and no mistake&#x201C;! Do not be angry with me&#x2014;if nobody else finds fault with you for what in itself is so puerile a matter, it can only be because no one else likes to accept the ungrateful service of a faultfinding friend&#x2014;but I cannot let you spoil the pleasure of your letters without entering my sincere protest.</p>
<p>And now of myself&#x2014; My cough is quite gone, and I have been out some half dozen times. To say that I am <hi rend="italic">well</hi> would be a misapplication of the word; but I am no longer what people call <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>. For the rest; I must take another day for telling you of it, or of as much of it as you would care to hear&#x2014;for Mazzini will be here in a few minutes <hi rend="italic">to take leave</hi>. He went to Paris so soon as Louis Phillipe decamped&#x2014;to see I suppose if anything could be arranged for a new &#x201C;Savoy&#x2019;s Expidition&#x201C;; the distinct prospect of being permitted to return to Genoa &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">in peace</hi>&#x201C; being <hi rend="italic">extremely distressing</hi> to him!!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini left London for Paris, <date when="1848-03-01">1 March</date>, using a borrowed passport. On <date when="1848-03-02">2 March</date> he suggested that an address be sent from the Peoples&#x2019; International League (founded London, <date when="1847-04-00">April 1847</date>), expressing sympathy with the new republic, for him to present as its delegate. In Paris he gathered some 200 Italian patriots into an Italian National Assoc., to supersede Young Italy. He left for London, <date when="1848-03-12">12 March</date>.

He wrote that he would be here today at two o&#x2019;clock; and was going off again to Paris on Wednesday&#x2014;probably not to return<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1848-03-17">17 March</date> Milan rose against the Austrians and by <date when="1848-03-22">22 March</date> freed itself of occupying troops. Uprisings also occurred in Venice, Parma, and other Italian cities on news of the Milan revolution. As Italy was now rising, as Mazzini had long urged, he wanted to be close to the action. He left for Paris, <date when="1848-03-26">26 March</date>. On <date when="1848-03-27">27 March</date> he led a large deputation of the Italian National Assoc. wearing cockades of the Italian tricolor to the H&#xF4;tel de Ville and read the Assoc.&#x2019;s tribute to the new republic, to which Lamartine replied (<hi rend="italic">Scritti</hi> 35:68&#x2013;71). He left Paris, <date when="1848-04-01">1 April</date>, and reached Milan, <date when="1848-04-07">7 April</date>.</note>&#x2014; I shall hear if he got your note<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably in reply to his letter of <date when="1848-01-25">25 Jan.</date> to ask whether she wished to contribute to a fund to assist Italian national independence, for which some Englishwomen hoped to raise &#xa3;1,000; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480212-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, <date when="1848-02-12">12 Feb.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; I take the prospect of his final departure with a <hi rend="italic">calm</hi> that would surprise you. Whether it be that my <hi rend="italic">feelings</hi> have got extremely chilled by years and suffering&#x2014;or that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has worn them out&#x2014;perhaps both causes have operated towards making me tolerably unconcerned.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I had a Note from Jean yesterday, which gave us much satisfaction, assuring us that you and the rest were still in a tolerable usual way, all of you. Welcome truly is such news,&#x2014;Oh we do not know how precious and worth welcoming it is!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Today I am very <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> (the fire having gone out), and my time for walking is already struck: however, I write you a word to say the like of ourselves; we too are all moderately well. Jane indeed still continues weak; but she is getting steadily a little better: she goes out whenever it is bright weather, without damage: today she is down stairs <hi rend="italic">making marmalade</hi>;&#x2014;she kindly salutes you all. Our weather is very wet and <hi rend="italic">clashy</hi> [messy]: I hardly remember here so wet a Spring as we have. Jack continues busy and well; I too am fully as well as usual, and certainly not <hi rend="italic">idler</hi>. On the contrary I think I shall again get very busy by and by.&#x2014; Emerson is come back to Town; but he is in a lodging of his own, a good way off us: he came here last night, accompanied by Jack, of whom he is very fond. I am to dine at the Barings&#x2019;s tomorrow in honour of E.: most other such proposals I have rejected.&#x2014; &#x2014; And what a time of Republics and Revolutions it is! The whole world, with hardly the exception of one Kingdom but our own, has started up into a kind of insurrection, and said to its Kings, &#x201C;Better Laws or &#x2014;!&#x201C; People here are in a great emotion about it; the incrediblest rumours are rife every day; and tho&#x2019; all are rather in the laughing vein as yet, I imagine all of us may get to be very serious before we see the end of it yet! Of late days, I have been reading some of the Books these new Parisian <hi rend="italic">Kings</hi> had written, which I should not have read otherwise: Louis Blanc, for one, I find to be a truly convinced and sincere man; but his <hi rend="italic">head</hi>, I take it, is none of the biggest, poor little fellow!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Joseph Louis Blanc (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>), founder of state socialism, member of the French provisional govt.; author of <hi rend="italic">Organisation du Travail</hi> (Paris, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>) and <hi rend="italic">R&#xE9;volution Fran&#x26;ccedil;aise.

Alas, it was found to be unpublishable: it ope<supplied>[n]</supplied>ly <hi rend="italic">approved</hi> of at least the <hi rend="italic">attempt</hi> by France to do something for the guidance and benefit of the workpeople: and our poor Editor<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster.</note> (really it was a necessity with him), after struggling all he could, was obliged to suppress it. For <pb id="pg-22-275" n="22:275"/>which indeed I was heartily obliged; and indeed the poor man did it with the uttermost reluctance, being infinitely desirous to get me to write for him. But the truth is, it will be better if I try to write a whole Book on the subject? A Book of my own: there I have elbow-room enough; and no master over me, except (as I hope) One in Heaven! We shall see.</p>
<p>Let me not forget altogether to tell you of the Peel Dinner.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Bath House, <date when="1848-03-18">18 March</date>.</note> It took effect duly last Saturday Evening: a handsome Party, C. Buller Richard Milnes (the Yorkshire friend), Sir James Graham, several Lords &#x26;c with Ladies, finally Sir R. Peel and his Wife.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Graham (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11204"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), home sec. under Peel, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>. Lady Julia Peel, b. Floyd (d. <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), m. <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>.</note> Peel is a capital-looking man; five feet eleven or so, with a fine head thrown slightly back, straight as a plummet, yet altogether a mild and friendly expression, especially a fine low-toned mellow persuasive <hi rend="italic">voice</hi>; and a &#x201C;bonny eagle-eye&#x201C; when he is interested. To me he was very kind: I sat next him (by favourable arrangement), and we had considerable talk together, in a very friendly vein but not on any deep matter; about the new French Government, about the old French Revolution &#x26;c; on all subjects he spoke like a man of sense and kind gentle manners: what pleased me best of all however (for little could come out of a man in such a scene) I found in him a decided <hi rend="italic">sense of fun</hi>, a real <hi rend="italic">laugh</hi> in him, such as one does not often meet in the artificial circles his lot has been cast in.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC noted in his Journal, <date when="1848-03-27">27 March</date>, that Peel referred to &#x201C;Milnes, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ouvrier</hi></foreign>&#x201C;&#x2014;Milnes the Worker&#x2014;alluding to Milnes&#x2019;s recent conversion to the republican cause and told a story about a London rioter at the time of the <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> Reform Bill. &#x201C;I consider him [Peel] by far our first Public Man, which indeed is saying little; and hope that England, in these frightful times, may still get some good of him.&#x201C;.</note> On the whole, I decidedly liked Peel; and could not but hope some real good might yet lie in him for the Country. He is clearly by far the likeliest public man I have ever spoken with; seems to me incomparably better furnished both with talent and disposition than any other we have at present. Before eleven o&#x2019;clock he went away, to attend a thing they call &#x201C;the Speaker&#x2019;s Soiree&#x201C; (a House of Commons thing), and by and by Buller brought me homeward in his little carriage (for Buller has now got rich promotion,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As chief poor law commissioner, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>.</note> and keeps a bit carriage), and so I ended this Adventure.&#x2014; Before very long, it is thought by many, we shall have Peel prime minister again.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I am scribbling at no allowance;&#x2014;and the main errand of my Letter is like to be forgotten! Along with this, comes a <hi rend="italic">roll</hi> which will surprise you very much: let Jenny open it carefully, not <hi rend="italic">slitting</hi> too deep,&#x2014;and you will find a Picture: tell me what you think of it; or bid Jean tell me.</p>
<p>They cost 5/; and the poor man, I fear, is a kind of simpleton, and will <pb id="pg-22-276" n="22:276"/>make but little money by it: I have bought only 2; another for Germany and this.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amalie B&#xF6;lte wrote to Varnhagen, <date when="1848-03-21">21 March</date>, that TC was &#x201C;so little taken with the portrait that I sent you of him, that another of his own choosing is being despatched to you today. There you see the vanity of our philosopher. I often meet Emerson there now; he has a good-humored countenance, and says nothing of importance; but he listens well, and Carlyle likes that&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 59, trans). Varnhagen had already replied, <date when="1848-03-16">16 March</date>, on receiving TC&#x2019;s portrait, that he was &#x201C;extremely pleased. His features are very significant, they express intelligence and convictions, strength and gentleness.&#x201C; He wrote, <date when="1848-06-25">25 June</date>, on receiving another, larger portrait: &#x201C;In this &#x2026; his intellectual character is expressed more sharply and clearly than in the smaller picture, which however I should not want to be without. It is a real pleasure for me to keep looking at these noble, powerful features, their fundamental expression is integrity, then comes sagacity, finally humor. I also see a great deal of courage and energy, even though preoccupied Fate&#x2014;as Rahel says&#x2014;has so far neglected to make significant demands of these from him&#x201C; (Varnhagen von Ense, <hi rend="italic">Briefe an Eine Freundin</hi> [Hamburg, <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>] 59, 112&#x2013;13, trans.).</note></p>
<p>Jean says there is a new <hi rend="italic">Gig</hi> in the way of buying: tell her I am heartily glad of it; more over that I promised Jamie at Scotsbrig &#x201C;to <hi rend="italic">help</hi> him to buy&#x201C; such a thing, and that certainly I will keep my word. If it be a right article, let them snatch it up at once.</p>
<p>I am to write to Jean herself one of these days: so I end at present. Tell her Jane is much gratified by her knitwork, and will herself say as much in a short time.&#x2014; Jenny is well, we hope; and the little <foreign>Bairns</foreign>? Take care of yourself, dear Mother! I mean to send a little Book shortly. Meanwhile you may have a <hi rend="italic">Times daily</hi> if you like.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., he would send her his copy of the paper, which he had just begun to take.</note> <closer><salute>And so <foreign>adieu</foreign> dear Mother for this day. God bless you all.</salute></closer></p>

<p>To us as to you this immense explosion of democracy in France, and from end to end of Europe, is very remarkable and full of interest.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine had written to TC, <date when="1848-03-20">20 March</date>: &#x201C;The great volcano has recommenced work again&#x2014;although it does not seem quite decided as to what direction it is to take&#x2014; Of course I have been in thought often turning to you&#x2014;with the wish to know what you were seeing in it&#x2014;or predicting about it.&#x201C;.</note> Certainly never in our time was there seen such a spectacle of history as we are now to look at and assist in. I call it very joyful; yet also unutterably sad. Joyful, inasmuch as we are taught again that all mortals do long towards justice and veracity; that no strongest charlatan, no cunningest fox of a Louis Philippe, <pb id="pg-22-277" n="22:277"/>with his great <hi rend="italic">Master</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Guizot.</note> to help him, can found a habitation upon lies, or establish a &#x201C;throne of iniquity&#x201C;&#x2014;nay, that he cannot even attempt such a problem in these times any more; which we may take to be blessed news indeed, in the pass we were come to. But, on the other hand, how sad that the news <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be so <hi rend="italic">new</hi> (for that is really the vital point of the mischief); that all the world, in its protest against False Government, should find no remedy but that of rushing into No Government or anarchy (kinglessness), which I take this republican universal suffragism to inevitably be.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The provisional govt. decreed universal male suffrage, <date when="1848-03-02">2 March</date>.</note> Happily they are not disposed to fight, at least not with <hi rend="italic">swords</hi>, just yet; but abundance of <hi rend="italic">fighting</hi> (probably enough in all kinds) one does see in store for them; and long years and generations of weltering confusion, miserable to contemplate, before anything can be <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> again. Hardly since the invasion of the wild Teutons and wreck of the old Roman Empire has there been so strange a Europe, all turned topsy turvy, as we now see. What was at the top has come, or is rapidly coming, to the <hi rend="italic">bottom</hi>, where indeed, such was its intrinsic quality, it deserved this long while past to be.</p>
<p>All over London people are loud upon the French, H&#xF4;tel de Ville especially;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The bastion of the radicals in Paris.</note> censure universal, or light mockery; no recognition among us for what of merit those poor people have in their strange and perilous position at present. Right to hurl out Louis Philippe, most of us said or thought, but there I think our approval ended. The what next upon which the French had been thinking, none of our people will seriously ask themselves. I, in vain, strive to explain that this of the &#x201C;organisation of labour&#x201C; is precisely the question of questions for all governments whatsoever; that it vitally behoved the poor French Provisional to attempt a solution; that by their present implements and methods it seems impossible they should succeed;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the compromise between the rival republicans and socialists the provisional govt. recognized the right to work (i.e., guaranteed employment) and implemented this by establishing national workshops. A kind of parliament of workers and employers was set up to discuss problems of common interest, but the employers showed little interest. Meanwhile, the right wing prepared to gain control by bringing troops to Paris and arranging for elections. The workers became alarmed, and a mass demonstration was organized by the radical leader Louis Auguste Blanqui (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>), <date when="1848-03-17">17 March</date>, which might have overthrown the govt. had not Louis Blanc guided it into moderate channels.</note> but that they, and what is better, all governments, must actually make some advance towards success and solve said question more and more, or disappear swiftly from the face of the earth without successors nominated.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter Erskine said: &#x201C;I wish we had some popular exposition of the questions&#x2014;how much can a government do for a people? &#x26; how much must a people do for themselves? I wish also that both rich &#x26; poor could come to apprehend, that we are spiritual beings under spiritual laws, &#x26; that the transgression of these laws is visited by fearful penalties&#x2014;but that no human laws nor institutions can take the place of these spiritual laws.&#x201C;.</note> There seems to me only that alternative; <pb id="pg-22-278" n="22:278"/>and, however it may fare with the French, I calculate that we here at home shall profit inexpressibly by such an example, if we be wise to try the inevitable problem while it is yet <hi rend="italic">time</hi>. In fact, I have a kind of notion to write a book about it, I myself; but I am not yet grown sufficiently <hi rend="italic">miserable</hi> to set about it straightway.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had already written specifically about the need to work, as in <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:135) and <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>, where the &#x201C;&#x2018;Organising of Labour&#x2019; is, if well understood, the Problem of the whole Future&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 10:195, 257&#x2013;58). He was to take it up again in the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi>, calling &#x201C;the &#x2018;Organisation of Labour&#x2019; &#x2026; the universal vital Problem of the world,&#x201C; recommending &#x201C;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Industrial</hi> Regiments,&#x2019;&#x201C; and declaring in the unfinished speech of a fantastic prime minister, &#x201C;Here is work for you &#x2026; . The Organisation of Labour&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 20:36, 147, 46).</note> Fraternity, liberty, &#x26;c., I want to explain, is not the remedy at all; but true <hi rend="italic">government</hi> by the wise, true, and noble-minded of the foolish, perverse, and dark, with or <hi rend="italic">against</hi> their consent; which I discern to be the eternal law of the world, and a rugged and severe but most blessed law, terribly forgotten in the universal twaddle, insincerity, and cowardly sloth of these latter times.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had also noted similar ideas in his Journal, <date when="1848-03-05">5 March</date>, but added that though they &#x201C;would make a volume &#x2026; I am sick, lazy, and dispirited.&#x201C;.</note> Peace! peace! when there is no peace?<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jer. 6:14, 8:11.</note> I have, in fact, a great many things to say, far too many; and my heart is as if half-dead, and has no wish to speak any more, but to lie <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, if so might be, till it sank into the Divine silence, and were then at rest. Courage, however!</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks to you. If it is not too much trouble, I shall be very glad to have those Cromwell Letters from your hand. I shall need to get them some way or other; and your Copy, it would seem, is of the original edition. They have been reprinted in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, in which form I got a glance of them, one day, in the London Library; but not in that or in any form have I yet got a reading of them, much less a Copy, tho&#x2019; of course I shall need one.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480318-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1848-03-18">18 March</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Since you were here,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had written Childs, <date when="1847-04-16">16 April 1847</date>, to offer him some teeth from bodies dug up at Naseby; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470416-TC-JCHI-01"><sic>21:194</sic><corr>TC to JCHI, <date when="1847-04-16">16 April 1847</date></corr></ref>. Childs had written to TC, <date when="1848-01-24">24 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;When&#x2014;a good many months ago&#x2014;you kindly promised me a &#x2018;Grinder&#x2019; found in Naseby Field, it was my intention to make a very speedy descent upon you,&#x201C; but he had been unable to come (see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480125-TC-JCHI-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCHI</corr>, <date when="1848-01-25">25 Jan.</date></ref>). Childs evidently visited Cheyne Row, <date when="1848-02-18">18 Feb.</date>, because with the teeth and bone in Strouse there are two notes in TC&#x2019;s hand stating that they were &#x201C;presented to John Childs of Bungay &#x2026; <date when="1848-02-18">18 feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi>, 1848</date>&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420924-TC-EF-01"><sic>15:101&#x2013;2</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-24">24 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>). A photograph of the silver box (in which Childs presumably had mounted the teeth), opened and showing TC&#x2019;s notes, is reprod. in <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Carlyle &#x26; His Era</hi>, ed. J. D. James and R. B.

Nearly always between two and 3 o&#x2019;clock I am accessible here, without any warning.&#x2014; Neither are you to forget Abbot Samson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">seal</hi>, whatever that may be; anything that can be authentically traced to my friend Samson will surely be welcome to me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Abbot Samson (<date when="1135-00-00">1135</date>&#x2013;<date when="1211-00-00">1211</date>) of Bury St. Edmunds, who figures largely in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>.</note></p>

God help poor England: if they go chewing the wind, in their Parliament and elsewhere, as they have been doing this long while, and accomplishing mere &#x201C;Parliamentary eloquence,&#x201C; we also shall have to take the big Fall; and a terrible one it will be, I guess! Truly it is time for us all to quit our grimacing, to question what &#x201C;divine oracles&#x201C; we have (in the Scrip-market or elsewhere), and prepare for bitter earnest, the Destinies having said plainly that the hour draws nigh.&#x2014; Cobden, poor fellow, will find that his &#x201C;Free-trade&#x201C; Gospel goes but a little way towards the mark. Quite other than Cobdens, I apprehend, will be wanted,&#x2014;if we have them; and if <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, it will be terribly unlucky for us!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My Wife is very much obliged by your beneficent endeavours to help that poor man.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480306-JWC-JCHI-01">JWC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCHI</corr>, [<date when="1848-03-06">6 March</date>]</ref>.</note> He has been frequently in the City, and gets encouragement to hope (poor creature), but nothing farther hitherto that I hear of.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I wrote to my Mother, the day after your Note came, a stock of news, <pb id="pg-22-281" n="22:281"/>which I suppose you would immediately hear: today I am to be upon money matters; and having very little time, must endeavour to be brief.</p>
<p>Here is a Bank Cheque for &#xa3;10, for which James will get payment: deducting his own account &#xa3;1.9.0, there remains &#xa3;8.11.0, which I commission him to hand to my Mother, to &#x201C;help to buy the Gig,&#x201C; or do what she likes with. I am very glad indeed to hear of a new Gig that you approve of, and decidedly think it ought to be purchased straightway. The <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of the price you speak of will be &#xa3;7.10, which leaves my Mother a Guinea over, to buy <hi rend="italic">herself</hi> a &#x201C;fairing&#x201C; with;&#x2014;and this arrangement will redeem my promise with Jamie, if my Mother judge fit to go exact <hi rend="italic">halves</hi> with him: but I think it better to leave the matter wholly in her hand. And so I wish you to write to Jamie straightway how the matter stands; and on the whole to get the bargain concluded without loss of time,&#x2014;or if any difficulty occur, to let me know about it. And that is enough for money today. Your poor dud of a &#x201C;Newspaper&#x201C; costs next to nothing, and is always paid along with my own: do not speak of it at present,&#x2014;unless I happen to <hi rend="italic">dun</hi> you for it! I have got a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> now, too, for myself; the world&#x2019;s history is getting into such a <hi rend="italic">gallop</hi> everywhere, one can hardly keep pace with it. Jack and I have also got a <hi rend="italic">French</hi> Newspaper (<hi rend="italic">Le National</hi>) between us, daily; but that, I rather think, will have to be renounced, as more than I can get read. I am also thinking seriously of some kind of Book,&#x2014;poor wretch!&#x2014;but the times with me too are not without their difficulties!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On Thursday I had again an eight-o&#x2019;-clock <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi> to execute at the Barings&#x2019;s, on occasion of Emerson,&#x2014;or rather Emerson was but the <hi rend="italic">excuse</hi> of it, for he kept very quiet; mild modest eyes, lips sealed together like a pair of pincers, and nobody minded him much: we had quantities of Lords, Town-wits (Thackeray &#x26;c), beautiful Ladies;&#x2014;and I, as usual, got a most sick head and heart by it; not likely to recover for two days yet.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote his wife, <date when="1848-03-24">24 March</date>, that &#x201C;the company was Lord &#x26; Lady Ashburton, Lord Auckland, Carlyle, Milnes, Thackeray, Lord &#x26; Lady Castlereagh, the Bishop of Oxford (Wilberforce) &#x26; one or two ladies beside. In the evening came Charles Buller&#x201C; (Rusk 4:43). George Eden (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>; <ref target="volume-22/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8451"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 1st earl of Auckland, 1st lord of the admiralty, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> and <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>; gov.-gen. of India, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>.

Frederick William Robert Stewart (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">72</date>), styled Viscount Castlereagh until he succeeded as 4th marquess of Londonderry, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>; m., <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>, Elizabeth Frances Charlotte, b. Jocelyn (d. <date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>), da. of the 3d earl of Roden and widow of the 6th Viscount Powerscourt.</note> One of the Ladies there, a beauty declared, Lady Castlereagh whom I had seen once before,&#x2014;sends down a flunkey yesternight to ask me for another such ploy to her own mansion: Oh Heavens, no! I answered; there is nothing but mischief, and indigestion with headaches, in all that for me! This Lady, however, really seemed to me a very nice well-conditioned woman; her <pb id="pg-22-282" n="22:282"/>Husband (nephew and heir of the <hi rend="italic">famed</hi> Castler<hi rend="italic">h</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Stewart (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>), 2d marquess of Londonderry, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>, better known as Viscount Castlereagh (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>), holder of various cabinet ministries known for illiberal policies during the Napoleonic Wars.</note>) told one by his very face that probably he was &#x201C;a considerable of a blackguard,&#x201C; or had been in past days.</p>
<p>We have dry hard weather now, with real pall of March-dust; in which I hope you participate. Jane continues weakly; avoids the N.E. wind, and does not stir much out.&#x2014; Did the <hi rend="italic">Picture</hi> come safe?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480322-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, [<date when="1848-03-22">22 March</date>]</ref>.</note> Tell me <hi rend="italic">quietly</hi> what our Mother thinks of it: opinions <hi rend="italic">here</hi> are somewhat divided. I yesterday sent a Book: was that all right?&#x2014;Write to me again soon, dear Jean: you are to have a Letter for your kind Gift of the <hi rend="italic">mats</hi>. <closer><salute>All good be with you all!</salute></closer></p>
