<p>Sheila McIntosh has been with the edition since <date when="1993">1993</date> (volumes 19&#x2013;21) and from her first joining was a great asset to the editorial team. She has been an editor from volume 29 to volume 35. She has now retired but had completed all her editorial work on volume 35 before retirement. She has chosen not to appear on the title page or spine of this volume. Happily she has continued to act as a consulting editor to the edition.</p>

<p>This volume includes letters from <date when="1859-01-00">January</date> to <date when="1859-10-00">October 1859</date>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of the 199 letters in this volume, 151 are from TC and 48 are from JWC. Fifteen (31 percent) of JWC&#x2019;s letters and one hundred and three (68 percent) of TC&#x2019;s letters are previously unpublished. Nineteen (40 percent) of JWC&#x2019;s and twenty five (17 percent) of TC&#x2019;s are published in full. Twelve (25 percent) of JWC&#x2019;s and six (4 percent) of TC&#x2019;s are published in part. Two (4 percent) of JWC&#x2019;s and fourteen (9 percent) of TC&#x2019;s are quoted. Three (2 percent) of TC&#x2019;s are catalog entries only.</note> In some ways this is an unusual volume of the <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> in that the Carlyles spent a great deal of the year together, rather than separated by holiday or other travel, as they had been in previous years. Thus the hectic exchange of daily letters that each demanded&#x2014;indeed insisted on with increasing vehemence&#x2014;is less evident in this volume&#x2019;s crop. Instead, we have a rather fuller number of letters to others from Jane Welsh Carlyle (JWC) during the months when Thomas Carlyle (TC) was locked away in his attic study laboring in &#x201C;the valley of the shadow of <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi>&#x201D; trying to increase his momentum (and raise his interest) after the excitement of publishing the first two volumes in <date when="1858">1858</date>. He little realized at the time that he had seven more years ahead. There is a fascinating run of letters, planning their summer in Scotland. They wisely traveled separately, moving about Fife and in the lowlands between family and friends, battling with weather, with railway timetables, with variable health and thin nerves. Finally, the letters provide a vivid insight into the return to Chelsea, the almost audible sigh of regret as TC picks up his pen and JWC the reins of managing 5 Cheyne Row and all the human dramas it seemed to contain.</p>
<p>The early months of <date when="1859">1859</date> show JWC&#x2019;s irritations with her husband with great clarity; going on holiday with him did little to mend the situation. When he was writing TC was a creature of habit; he locked himself away most of the daylight hours, emerging in anything but a good mood for his daily ride or walk, his daily sleep, his late dinner, and the stimulus of whichever visitors came to call before he took his late-night walk to smoke a final pipe, trying for a night&#x2019;s sleep. While he might be in the same house as his wife, she saw little of him; when she did see him it was not always at a propitious moment for relaxed conversation&#x2014;breakfasts were often fractious and dinners were eaten apart, for JWC ate much earlier than TC. There was often company in the evenings but even then, if the company was Joseph Neuberg or Henry <pb id="pg-35-xiv" n="35:xiv"/>Larkin, the talk might well be of Frederick and of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great,</hi> of maps, of proofs, and of printers.</p>
<p>Small wonder, then, that JWC had her own circle. At its heart was Geraldine Jewsbury, whose frequent visits were remarked on by others. But there was a much wider circle and beyond that some close and confidential correspondence with those like Mary Russell to whom she could pour out the accumulated tensions that life in Cheyne Row could generate. As well as a ferociously sharp wit JWC had, it is perfectly plain, a real gift for friendship:</p>
<p>My dear! I haven&#x2019;t time&#x2014;nor inclination for much letterwriting&#x2014; Nor have you, I should suppose;&#x2014;but do let us exchange letters <hi rend="italic">now and then</hi>&#x2014;a friendship that has lived on air, for so many years together, is worth the trouble of giving it a little human sustenance. / Give my kind regards to your Husband&#x2014; I like him. And believe me your ever affectionate / Jane Welsh Carlyle. (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18591021-JWC-SS-01">JWC to Susan Stirling, <date when="1859-10-21">21 Oct.</date></ref>)</p>
<p>When she was less inclined to show her affection, she could write of unwelcome guests with merciless parody, as she did to Walter Mantell; this no doubt reinforced the message that he should beware of demonstrative women, since Geraldine was at that moment making very obvious advances to him, to the disapproval of both Carlyles:</p>
<p>When your note was brought in, I was in the act of telling Miss Pardoe, authoress of <hi rend="italic">The City of the Sultan</hi> (good god!)&#x2014;a woman who makes calls with a head bobbing all over with waterlillies! and who is just the person for spreading news with moral and sentimental Comentaries&#x2014;was just in the act of telling <hi rend="italic">her</hi> the shocking catastrophe at London Bridge!&#x2014;and Politeness of course exacted that I should not read your note till the Waterlillies had sailed out in a high state of excitement!&#x2014; (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18591009-JWC-WMAN-01">JWC to Walter Mantell, [<date when="1859-10-09">9 Oct.</date>]</ref>)</p>
<p>This volume&#x2019;s letters show the width of JWC&#x2019;s correspondence, which (despite her claims that she had little time for letter writing) was impressive, as was her gift of adapting tone and content to the receiver. She could show real sympathy as well as feline wit; she writes to Betty Braid (her mother&#x2019;s old servant) of the Donaldson sisters in Haddington: &#x201C;Miss Donaldson &#x2026; is wearing away; but so slowly! and painfully! It breaks my heart to think of her! And Miss Jess is as much to be pitied as the other&#x2014;about to be left solitary at <hi rend="italic">her</hi> age&#x2014;and she a confirmed invalid since before I was born!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18590303-JWC-BB-01">JWC to Betty Braid, [<date when="1859-03-03">3 March?</date>]</ref>). The feline wit shows in her comments to her young admirer, John George Cooke, about the engagement of Isabella Barnes, her doctor&#x2019;s daughter:</p>
<p>([Y]ou remember her? remember her! will you ever forget her?) has found a Being she can love! and who <hi rend="italic">loves</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">her</hi>!!&#x2014;. &#x2026; As odd as any <pb id="pg-35-xv" n="35:xv"/>other part of my news is, that the little girl was moved in spirit to write and tell <hi rend="italic">me</hi> of her happiness! &#x2026; [T]he whole of her letter, which is excessively sentimental, breaths a spirit of beautiful <hi rend="small-caps">humility</hi> (!!) towards <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> and of young girl enthusiasm towards her lover and her Father and me and every body! &#x2026; I could have taken my Bible Oath, that this little girl hadnt one spark of <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> or <hi rend="italic">humility</hi> (of all things) in her whole composition! (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18590902-JWC-JGCO-01">JWC to George Cooke, [<date when="1859-09-02">2 Sept.</date>]</ref>)</p>
<p>TC meanwhile was locked in a furious battle with his German sources, with books, with maps, with a language that obviously gave him problems (he was glad of Neuberg&#x2019;s help in both translation and transcription), with libraries (here also he was very glad to let others suffer the inconvenience and the bad air of the libraries of the time)&#x2014;above all with the sense that <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> was a rock he was pushing up a long hill to which he could see no summit. He was unaware when he made his ridiculously optimistic early forecasts that the final volumes would not be published until <date when="1865">1865</date>, nor did JWC know that TC&#x2019;s labors on the book would last almost as long as the remainder of her life. The writing of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> is the ground bass to this volume of their letters, as it was to the previous volume and will be to the next few. The problems were the same whichever volume TC was tackling: a profusion of sources that he found inexact, badly organized, wretchedly indexed, and often contradictory; the enormous amount of material that he collected and wrote on slips and on odd pages (many of which survive) and that he slowly assembled into coherent sections, battle by battle, campaign by campaign, footnoting and annotating his sources often with sarcastic or abusive comment, and always with the sense that the job would never finish.</p>
<p>Last year was not a propitious one to me: I returned, rather before this day of the month, out of Germany &#x2026; and in a few days farther I started the attempt to finish my miserable big Task, as it were by sheer force, and violently <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> my way to the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of it. Alas, the attempt had no success with me. (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18591007-TC-AC-01">TC to Alexander Carlyle, <date when="1859-10-07">7 Oct.</date></ref>)</p>
<p>It does not appear to me hitherto that the History of Fred<hi rend="italic">k can</hi> be written; that I, or any mortal, can make a <hi rend="italic">human</hi> Book of it to Englishmen of this day. So <hi rend="italic">in</hi>human has <hi rend="italic">it</hi> grown, under the continual manipulation of stupid men; so inhuman (in another kind) have <hi rend="italic">they</hi> grown under d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>! If one cannot write it, one can let it lie unwritten? That will be a sorry condition too. On the whole, one must do one&#x2019;s very utmost bad-best,&#x2014;&#x26; had better, for this reason, hold one&#x2019;s peace in the interim. (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18591003-TC-SGSOUC-01">TC to Sir George Sinclair or Unidentified Correspondent, <date when="1859-10-03">3 Oct.</date></ref>)</p>
<p>TC had a gift for friendship as much as JWC, and a reservoir of charm that he could display when he chose, however infrequently. To Henry Larkin, for <pb id="pg-35-xvi" n="35:xvi"/>instance, on whose volunteer help he relied so heavily in the Frederick years, he wrote a really handsome letter of gratitude, enclosing a rather self-interested gift:</p>
<p>I got you a <hi rend="italic">Life-Ticket for the London Library;</hi> of which, if it be not so very useful till our hands are a little freer, I hope you will get a great deal of good in future years. It is the best Lending-Library I know of in London or anywhere else. &#x2026; If I had been King Friedrich, I would have given you a pretty little mansion and grounds, for your merits to me; but that not being so, I have on cheap terms procured you a small <hi rend="italic">spiritual freehold,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you are to occupy wisely, for my sake and your own, during the many years wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I hope are still ahead for you. (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18590106-TC-HL-01">TC to Henry Larkin, <date when="1859-01-06">6 Jan.</date></ref>)</p>
<p>And JWC noted how TC could make himself agreeable to guests&#x2014;when it suited his mood: &#x201C;&#x2018;At Home&#x2019; we are &#x2018;every night and all&#x2019;!&#x2014; That man will go nowhere! But likes seeing a very few rare samples of Humanity in his own room; and looks as pleased as a young &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Miss</hi>&#x2019; over her first Ball-invitation, at the purport of your note&#x2014; So pray don&#x2019;t fail us when the hour comes&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18590101-JWC-LST-01">JWC to Lady Stanley, [<date when="1859-01-01">1859</date>?]</ref>). While both Carlyles were prone to fail people when the hour came&#x2014;calling off on pretexts of health or business&#x2014;their letters underline strongly the intellectual excitement, as well as the human warmth, that characterizes the Carlyle circle in the parlor at Cheyne Row. With company there, the conversation flowed richly, and there was little indication of the tensions that could rise when things did not go smoothly.</p>
<p>Much of January into February deals with a tale of fresh eggs sent from Scotland and smashed in transit&#x2014;agreeably told by JWC and exaggerated in her typical style, but hardly concealing the irritation of living with someone who could himself exaggerate small discomforts into a major scene: &#x201C;[E]ver since your promise of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">fresh eggs</hi>&#x2019; reached Mr C; it had been, not absolutely <hi rend="italic">only</hi>, but without exaggeration&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">the only pleasant</hi> idea of his mind! &#x2018;in a few days there would be Gill Eggs to one&#x2019;s breakfast, Thank God!&#x2019; And in the meantime, his chronic discontent with his <hi rend="italic">fried bacon,</hi> with his <hi rend="italic">Yarmouth bloaters,</hi> because <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were <hi rend="small-caps">not</hi> fresh eggs was gradually rising to phrenzy pitch!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18590115-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to Mary Austin, [<date when="1859-01-15">mid-Jan.?</date>]</ref>). Even on holiday in Scotland, far from home and work and the everyday, JWC could find the temper tantrums trying as she confided in writing to Henry Larkin in London:</p>
<p>Oh M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin! Catch me ever again taking my holiday in the country along with a man of genius! I saw from the first that instead of a holiday it was going to be the hardest workday I had had for some time! I saw from the first what all that <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> as in seven league boots, and <hi rend="italic">galloping</hi> like the wild huntsman, and bathing in season and out of season like a <pb id="pg-35-xvii" n="35:xvii"/>merman and all that consumption of &#x201C;soft food was working together towards!&#x2014;a bilious crisis bad enough to make a poor wife&#x2019;s hair stand on end! and to make her ask herself twenty times a-day&#x2014;if it wouldnt be better to tie herself up to her bedpost and be done with it! / We might have been so comfortable <hi rend="italic">here</hi>&#x2014;if he had not already overdone himself at Humbie!&#x2014;a beautiful airy house, with kind little cousins close by to help us and cheer us. &#x2026; / Mr C has settled to go to Annandale in ten days&#x2014;where most fortunately there is no accommodation for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18590823-JWC-HL-01">JWC to Henry Larkin, [<date when="1859-08-23">23? Aug.</date>]</ref>)</p>
<p>A characteristic judgment in the same letter underlines how much JWC saw through even her closest confidantes: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell Geraldine you have heard from me&#x2014;above all <hi rend="italic">never</hi> tell her I write in bad spirits&#x2014; She is a person with whom it is prudent to always make the best of oneself&#x2014; And she is frightfully jealous.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For JWC, one of the attractions of braving the horrors of a long railway journey from London was the chance to go to Haddington to see her beloved godmother and her sister, Jean and Jess Donaldson (both of whom were to die in <date when="1860">1860</date>), and to revisit the scenes of her youth&#x2014;though, as her brilliant account of her trip in <date when="1849">1849</date>, &#x201C;Much ado about Nothing&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490802-JWC-MAAN-01"><sic>24:159&#x2013;71</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s MAAN, <date when="1849-08-02">2 Aug. 1849</date></corr></ref>), had made painfully clear, revisiting the scenes of her early life was anything but an uncomplicated pleasure. When the Donaldsons at Tenterfield (or Sunny Bank, its old name, which JWC persisted in using) were gone, she feared that &#x201C;Haddington will be turned all into a church-yard for me!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18590208-JWC-MR-01">JWC to Mary Russell, [ca. <date when="1859-02-08">8 Feb.</date>]</ref>). Any change to the Haddington of her memory was a shock and something to be resented. Venturing into the half-ruined St. Mary&#x2019;s Church to locate her father&#x2019;s grave, she was horrified to find the venerable building covered with scaffolding and undergoing extensive repair and restoration:</p>
<p>Nobody had told me&#x2014;nor had I noticed till inside it, that anything was doing to the old Church, and when a scene so revolting to any interested person presented itself, it was like a stunning blow on the face, taking away for some moments all power of distinguishing whether <hi rend="italic">his</hi> grave was <hi rend="italic">still there</hi>&#x2014;undisturbed!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">That,</hi> and the sorrowful state of things at Sunny Bank made my last visit to the dear old place so painful to me&#x2014;that I left it, privately determined to return no more! (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18590903-JWC-WDO-01">JWC to William Dodds, [<date when="1859-09-03">3 Sept.</date>]</ref>)</p>
<p>Neither Carlyle particularly enjoyed admitting to it, but they were growing into something approaching old age and, while the return to Scotland was a powerful summer ritual that was attractive in anticipation (particularly to TC, who found London in the summer heat unbearable), the reality often carried <pb id="pg-35-xviii" n="35:xviii"/>a sting in its tail. For TC, for instance, arriving at the family farm in Scotsbrig, the memories of his sister-in-law Isabella Carlyle (who had just died) and his adored mother (who had spent her last years there) were still very much present: &#x201C;Here all is a changed affair, except the old cordiality of welcome; sadly changed: ah me! &#x2026; I find it to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> been imprudent to have come <hi rend="italic">along</hi> with John; one of us sh<hi rend="italic">d not</hi> have been here: but I must make it do now&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18590909-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1859-09-09">9 Sept.</date></ref>). In Scotland, as these letters brilliantly illuminate, they lived with memory but failed to find much health:</p>
<p>In the village, Aberdour, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> stands low down nestled between woody mountains &#x26; the sea, there are quantities of visitors, Edinburgh <hi rend="italic">snobs</hi> mainly as I judge, with whom we have nothing to do: being <hi rend="italic">rustics</hi> we, and living on our own hilltop, half a mile off.&#x2014; In the way of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> I do nothing at all, or next to nothing; but do not want for confused thoughts, and multifarious remembrances, as I saunter about. (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18590723-TC-LS-01">TC to Lady Sandwich, <date when="1859-07-23">23 July</date></ref>)</p>
<p>Their summer months in Scotland were an interlude in a London life clouded with ill health, with seemingly intractable writing, and with occasional outbursts of bad feeling. Paradoxically, the period covered by this volume was also one of friendships made and maintained, of often brilliant correspondence, and obviously of a lot of fun behind the trivial everyday. JWC showed her sharp critical sense by fastening on the best book she had read, <hi rend="italic">Scenes of Clerical Life,</hi> &#x201C;and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is by a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18590208-JWC-GMC-01">JWC to Georgiana Craik, <date when="1859-02-08">[8 Feb.]</date></ref>). JWC&#x2019;s intelligence burned bright, however frail her health. And upstairs, while he cursed over the labor of <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> TC continued to enthrall a generation of admirers and friends with the acuity with which he observed his country, its writing, its politics, and its personalities. A letter to his brother John A. Carlyle refers to the political situation in Dominica because Alan Ker, an old friend, chief justice there, was home on leave and called at Cheyne Row. We can hear corroboration of TC&#x2019;s opinions in the reports of his conversations in other people&#x2019;s letters (for example, the letters of Thomas Woolner to Emily Tennyson). We also learn of visits to TC and JWC from the rich store of surviving letters written to them; for example, Mantell&#x2019;s visit to them in Fife, unmentioned by either of them at the time, is implied in one of John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s letters to TC.</p>
<p>TC&#x2019;s checkbooks (both the check stubs and returned cashed checks) show evidence of his finances and his generosity. It was gratifying to TC to be able to afford to travel, to send gifts to friends and family, and, from a fund bequeathed to him by Lady Harriet Ashburton, to help impecunious authors in London. The letters in this volume show how tactfully he could write with a small check. Poverty was no longer a concern; it is almost startling to read the casualness with which he writes to Charles Butler (<date when="1859-02-24">24 Feb.</date>) in the <pb id="pg-35-xix" n="35-xix"/>United States about his railway investments of thousands of pounds, with another &#xa3;1,000 available for Butler to invest for him in the United States if he wished. JWC, too, felt the change, as she wrote to her sister-in-law: &#x201C;Just now I am obliged to break off&#x2014;to prepare for a drive in &#x2018;a <hi rend="italic">neat Fly</hi>&#x2019; which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has forced on me twice a week&#x2014;and the expense of which seems to me to greatly outride the project!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-35/lt-18590207-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to Mary Carlyle Austin, [<date when="1859-02-07">7 Feb.?</date>]</ref>). JWC, who had braved convention and rode on omnibuses for exercise and fresh air, now had a carriage twice a week; she appreciated gifts, but she could now afford clothes whenever she wanted to buy them. The letters in this volume, unlike many of their predecessors, are not filled with complaints about money or about servants. Little Charlotte Southam, who traveled with them to Scotland and enjoyed her holiday&#x2014;it seems&#x2014;far more than her employers did theirs, was to give a period of welcome calm and stability to JWC&#x2019;s household arrangements; she was to remain a friend for many years after she left their employment.</p>
<p>What these letters do give us is a picture of the Carlyles&#x2014;ten months&#x2019; worth of their lives and their remarkable correspondence. The letters&#x2019; quality is as remarkable as is the fact of their preservation. First, the Chelsea letters underline the strain of life in the &#x201C;valley of the shadow of Frederick.&#x201D; Spring and autumn, the letters reveal TC in his attic growing more and more morose with a task that seems to be going nowhere, and slowly; spring and autumn, JWC chafes at the limitations of life with the massive writing task going on overhead and the uncertain temper of her husband morning and evening. Reading the letters of <date when="1859-01-00">January</date> to <date when="1859-10-00">October 1859</date>, the results of that strain are very visible in JWC&#x2019;s health, poor as always in winter, gradually improving in spring, never really rising to the challenge of fresh air and exercise in Scotland (TC&#x2019;s imagined cures for all ills), and soon collapsing back into nagging ill health on the return to London. As his wife saw, once in Scotland TC flung himself into bathing, riding, and farm diet too quickly and soon paid the price in bilious attacks, which left him in poor shape to face the coming winter&#x2019;s writing. Second, and paradoxically, despite the unceasing refrain of poor health and aggravation, the letters reveal the crackling intellectual and emotional energy of both Carlyles, as they continue to form the nucleus of a very varied circle in London, while through their correspondence, they remain in touch with friends and relations in Scotland, Canada, and the United States. While the private writings of both reveal deep melancholy, and their letters to confidants (JWC&#x2019;s to Mary Russell, TC&#x2019;s to his brother Alick in Canada) sound negative in the extreme, the fact remains that people came to Chelsea, offered their services freely to help TC with his writing, courted JWC&#x2019;s friendship, and continually invited her to visit. Visitors frequently left exhilarated by the conversation, the occasionally malicious wit, and the energy of both. These months reveal a couple married for thirty-three years, TC approaching <pb id="pg-35-xx" n="35:xx"/>his mid-sixties, JWC approaching sixty. TC is, beyond question, an eminent Victorian, JWC no longer has to remind people that &#x201C;I too am here&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350604-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>8:138</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, [<date when="1835-06-04">4 June 1835</date>]</corr></ref>)&#x2014;she has her own circle and her own place in her husband&#x2019;s circle. As the <hi rend="italic">Collected Letters</hi> approach the end of the <date when="1850">1850</date>s, they continue to illuminate two of the most remarkable lives of the nineteenth century.</p>

TC and JWC both decline an invitation from James John Garth Wilkinson to his daughter Emma&#x2019;s wedding on grounds of ill health (<date when="1859-06-06">6</date>). Larkin continues to work on maps (<date when="1859-06-10">10</date>), and Neuberg to research material for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>. With many changes of mind, the Carlyles are considering a holiday out of London, finally deciding on Humbie Farm, near <pb id="pg-35-xxxi" n="35:xxxi"/>Aberdour, Fife (<date when="1859-06-13">13</date>). TC, maid Charlotte, Nero, and Fritz take the Edinburgh steamer (<date when="1859-06-22">22</date>, arriving <date when="1859-06-24">24</date>); JWC travels by express train (22), visiting the Donaldsons in Haddington on the way.

JWC still feels weak and unwell but enjoys the clean house and the views at Humbie Farm. TC rides and bathes daily with Nero, whose mange is cured by the sea water, and Charlotte &#x201C;is the happiest of Girls&#x201D; ([<date when="1859-07-04">4</date>]).

TC recommends a spell in the country to John Forster and says he and his wife should consider coming to Fife (<date when="1859-07-10">10</date>). After two weeks there is no improvement in health for JWC; she goes to Auchtertool for a few days (<date when="1859-07-15">15</date>). TC visits the Ferguses in Kirkcaldy, calling at Auchtertool on the way back, &#x201C;a labourious futile, rather dreary day&#x201D; (<date when="1859-07-16">16</date>). JWC returns from Auchtertool (<date when="1859-07-18">18</date>). Weather turns &#x201C;wet rather troublesome.&#x201D; TC rides, and JWC is confined to the house again, having caught a cold in the damp weather (<date when="1859-07-21">21</date>); she &#x201C;continues weakly&#x201D; but goes out for walks (<date when="1859-07-25">25</date>). TC celebrates his idleness and tells Larkin that &#x201C;[t]he place is one of the finest I ever saw for outlooks and situation&#x201D; (<date when="1859-07-28">28</date>) but discourages his sister, Jean Aitken, from holidaying near them (<date when="1859-07-31">31</date>).</p>

Lease of Humbie farm ends (<date when="1859-08-05">5</date>), and they move to Auchtertool House, near the Manse where JWC&#x2019;s cousins live. Her cousins have prepared enough rooms for them in the house, which they have rent-free because of its bad state of repair ([<date when="1859-08-12">12</date>]). A. J. Scott asks for advice about leaving his teaching position in Manchester and editing a new magazine (<date when="1859-08-06">6</date>).

JWC is well enough to go out on her donkey; she complains of TC&#x2019;s restlessness, hoping that his plans for visiting Annandale materialize so that she can be alone and rest ([<date when="1859-08-12">12</date>]). John A. Carlyle and John Gordon visit from Edinburgh for the day (<date when="1859-08-13">13</date>). TC&#x2019;s cold improves; he bathes in the sea again and is enjoying the good weather, continuing his work on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> in the evenings (<date when="1859-08-15">15</date>). Thomas Spedding invites TC to visit in Mirehouse on his way back to London, but TC thinks it is unlikely he will visit (<date when="1859-08-17">17</date>).

John A. Carlyle visits from Edinburgh (<date when="1859-08-19">19</date>). TC is invited to Thomas Erskine&#x2019;s at Linlathen, but, to his relief, the visit is canceled (<date when="1859-08-21">21</date>). His health has improved, although he still suffers <pb id="pg-35-xxxii" n="35:xxxii"/>from a sore throat; he asks for John&#x2019;s help in getting cloth from Edinburgh for a new dressing gown and jacket to be made at The Gill when he visits (<date when="1859-08-25">25</date>). Both Carlyles continue to write to Larkin, enlisting his help on various matters. The donkey falls under JWC, bruising her (<date when="1859-08-28">28</date>). Leigh Hunt dies (<date when="1859-08-28">28</date>). TC consults with John A. Carlyle about visiting Annandale on his way home to London (<date when="1859-08-29">29</date>); John becomes impatient with TC&#x2019;s frequent changes of mind (<date when="1859-08-31">31</date>). JWC prefers to return to Chelsea by train by the east-coast route after visiting her aunts in Edinburgh with Charlotte.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1859-09-00">September</date>.</hi> TC apologizes to John A. Carlyle for being difficult over travel arrangements (<date when="1859-09-02">2</date>). JWC writes to George Cooke about Geraldine Jewsbury, who has been ill, and Walter Mantell ([<date when="1859-09-02">2</date>]). JWC asks William Dods about her father&#x2019;s grave at St. Mary&#x2019;s Kirk in Haddington after the horror of her last visit when she found &#x201C;trenching, and scaffolding, and bare, trampled, heaped up earth"; her stay in Fife has been &#x201C;more the Life of a picketted Sheep, than of a human woman&#x201D; ([<date when="1859-09-03">3</date>]). TC asks Larkin for help in settling his horse when Fritz arrives back in London with Charlotte (<date when="1859-09-05">5</date>). TC thanks Charles Butler for help with his American investments. He goes to Scotsbrig via Edinburgh with his brother John for company and sets about having his winter clothes made (<date when="1859-09-08">8</date>); he refuses an invitation to stay with Monckton Milnes in Yorkshire (<date when="1859-09-12">12</date>). JWC visits her aunts in Edinburgh and sees Charlotte, Nero, and Fritz on to the steamer at Granton (<date when="1859-09-14">14</date>). She visits Betty Braid at Upper Stenhouse (<date when="1859-09-15">15</date>) and stays one night with Mary Binnie at Prestonpans (<date when="1859-09-16">16</date>) on her way to Haddington and the Donaldson sisters (<date when="1859-09-17">17</date>).

TC moves to The Gill (<date when="1859-09-19">19</date>), then Scotsbrig (<date when="1859-09-25">25</date>). In Chelsea, JWC has trouble sleeping ([<date when="1859-09-26">26</date>]). TC arrives at the Stanleys&#x2019; in Alderley (<date when="1859-09-29">29</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1859-10-00">October</date>.</hi> TC arrives back in Chelsea (<date when="1859-10-01">1</date>); he feels gloomy on restarting work, despite his daily riding and Neuberg&#x2019;s and Larkin&#x2019;s help: &#x201C;It does not appear to me hitherto that the History of Fred<hi rend="italic">k can</hi> be written&#x201D; (<date when="1859-10-03">3</date>). JWC warmly invites Walter Mantell to visit (<date when="1859-10-06">6</date>). Anne Gilchrist calls (<date when="1859-10-11">11</date>). TC writes his brother Alexander in Canada about his mournful feelings on revisiting Ecclefechan (<date when="1859-10-07">7</date>) and tells his sister Jean Aitken of his slow but at least &#x201C;noticeable&#x201D; progress with <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1859-10-17">17</date>). JWC visits Richmond (<date when="1859-10-17">17</date>). TC again enlists Larkin&#x2019;s help in getting hold of maps for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1859-10-19">19</date>). He sends a sympathetic letter with a check to the chartist Ernest Jones who has suffered considerable financial losses (<date when="1859-10-20">20</date>); he declines Thackeray&#x2019;s request to contribute an article to the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine</hi> (<date when="1859-10-20">20</date>).

Neuberg, even though he is ill, <pb id="pg-35-xxxiii" n="35:xxxiii"/>continues working for TC (<date when="1859-10-23">23</date>). TC thinks that both he and JWC are better for their holiday (<date when="1859-10-26">26</date>). David Masson visits (<date when="1859-10-28">28</date>).

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Sir,</hi></salute>&#x2014;I very much approve your and Mr Milnes&#x2019;s notion about the Misses Begg,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Agnes Begg (<date when="1800">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893">93</date>) and Isabella Begg (<date when="1806">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888">88</date>), das. of Isabella Begg (<date when="1771">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858">4 Dec. 1858</date>), last surviving sister of poet Robert Burns (<date when="1759">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1796">96</date>)<sic>, who d. <date when="1858-12-04">4 Dec. 1858</date></sic>.

The honour we are about to pay to the Dead would be empty if we failed properly to show regard to the Living&#x201D; (<date when="1858-12-07">7 Dec. 1858</date>). A subscription for an annuity had been raised for Isabella Begg in <date when="1842">1842</date> (see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420403-TC-JWC-01"><sic>14:114&#x2013;15</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-04-03">3 April 1842</date></corr></ref>) and the prime minister, Sir Robert Peel (<date when="1788">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850">1850</date>), had settled a small pension on them (see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420607-TC-IBE-01"><sic>14:200</sic><corr>TC to IBE, <date when="1842-06-07">7 June 1842</date></corr></ref>). The obituary noted that the annuity from the subscribed &#xa3;400 died with her, with only &#xa3;160 having been reserved for the das. Richard Monckton Milnes wrote to the <hi rend="italic">Ayr Observer</hi>, <date when="1858-12-09">9 Dec. 1858</date>, reminding them that TC had been instrumental in raising that money, and urging that more money should now be raised for the daughters (<hi rend="italic">Ayr Observer</hi>, <date when="1858-12-14">14 Dec. 1858</date>).</note> and I hope you will not fail to get it executed with all the energy and skill that are possible, and with corresponding success. Could all the eloquence that will be uttered over the world on the 25th next,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Centenary of Burns&#x2019;s birth.</note> or even all the tavern-bills that will be incurred, but convert themselves into solid cash for those two interesting persons, what a sum were there of benefit received, and of loss avoided, to all the parties concerned! I think, at least the question ought to be everywhere put, pointedly yet with due politeness, wherever, in <pb id="pg-35-2" n="35:2"/>Scotland or elsewhere, there is an assemblage of men met to express their admiration, tragic pity, &#x26;c., for Burns, what amount of money they will give to save from indigence these two nieces of Burns? The answer, virtual answer, which this question got in <date when="1842">1842</date>, threw a rather dismal light to me on such assemblages; but they ought to be tried again,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A committee was appointed, <date when="1859-01-11">11 Jan.</date>, with William Buchanan as secretary; for a report and a list of initial subscribers, see <hi rend="italic">Ayr Advertiser</hi>, <date when="1859-01-20">20 Jan.</date> TC&#x2019;s promised &#xa3;5 was sent <date when="1859-01-25">25 Jan.</date> (TC&#x2019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753). Lists of subscribers were pbd. throughout the year; there were contributions from N. America, and further committees were appointed in Calcutta and in Australia (<hi rend="italic">Ayr Advertiser</hi>, <date when="1859-06-09">9 June</date>). The committee concluded the subscription, <date when="1859-12-08">8 Dec.</date>, with a written report from William Buchanan that &#xa3;1,128 8s 1d had been collected &#x201C;from persons of all ranks in life, of all shades of opinion, and from almost all quarters of the globe&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Ayr Advertiser</hi>, <date when="1859-12-22">22 Dec.</date>). &#xa3;1,000 was invested for Agnes and Isabella Begg with the remainder to be used to cover expenses and for donations to other Burns relatives. Buchanan wrote to the sisters, <date when="1860-01-20">20 Jan. 1860</date>, enclosing &#x201C;two Annuity Bonds of life Association of Scotland for &#xa3;20 each&#x201D; and a bank receipt for &#xa3;482 15s 8d, which was to be invested for them: &#x201C;I can assure you of the perfect readiness with which the subscribers to the fund sent in their contributions. &#x2026; You do not need to be told that the amount of a gift like this does not constitute its chief value.&#x201D; The sisters replied, <date when="1859-01-23">23 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;Thanks! Most heartfelt thanks! &#x2026; to all those heartfelt Samaritans. &#x2026; May they find, when time shall be no more, that what they gave here of their earthly substance has become treasure laid up for them in heaven!&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Ayr Advertiser</hi>, <date when="1860-02-09">9 Feb. 1860</date>).</note> with more direct emphasis; and very shame will perhaps force them to do something towards saving indigent merit on the one hand, and saving on the other what is too truly a frightful (though eloquent) expenditure of <hi rend="italic">pavement</hi> to a certain <hi rend="italic">locality</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hell; proverbial.</note> we have all heard of!

It is the best Lending-Library I know of in London or anywhere else; I believe, some 100,000 volumes in it, in various languages, on all manner of subjects; and you command 10 of them whenever you or yours think good, and have no trouble but the choosing.&#x2014; If I had been King Friedrich, I would have given you a pretty little mansion and grounds, for your merits to me; but that not being so, I have on cheap terms procured you a small <hi rend="italic">spiritual freehold,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you are to occupy wisely, for my sake and your own, during the many years wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I hope are still ahead for you.</p>

Indeed I have been inexpressibly busy for months and for years,&#x2014;with that frightful Book, and other burdens that lay heavy on me: I have in general lived perfectly alone; working all day, with what strength remained to so grey a man, then rushing out in the dusk to ride for a couple of hours, then home again to Books &#x26;c: it was seldom that I had leisure to write the smallest Note; indeed I wrote none except upon compulsion,&#x2014;and never wrote so <hi rend="italic">few</hi> in the same length of time on any terms before.

<p>You must take this enclosed Paper to some Bank (John says &#x201C;any Bank in Canada&#x201D; will do, and &#x201C;perhaps even give a premium&#x201D;); the Bank will change it into Canadian money (with or without a &#x201C;premium&#x201D;); and my little Jenny is to accept it as a small Newyears Gift from her Brother.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had asked John A.

<salute>My dear Mary,</salute>
<p>My <hi rend="italic">speechless dismay</hi> yesterday on the arrival of your box might be reproduced, with grand effect, on the stage of one of the minor theatres!</p>
<p>First I must tell you, that ever since your promise of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">fresh eggs</hi>&#x201D; reached M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C; it had been, not absolutely <hi rend="italic">only,</hi> but without exaggeration&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">the only pleasant</hi> idea of his mind! &#x201C;in a few days there would be Gill Eggs to one&#x2019;s breakfast, Thank God!&#x201D; And in the meantime, his chronic discontent with his <hi rend="italic">fried bacon,</hi> with his <hi rend="italic">Yarmouth bloaters,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Salted and smoked herring or mackerel, a specialty of Gt. Yarmouth, 121 mi. NE of London.</note> because <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were <hi rend="small-caps">not</hi> fresh eggs was gradually rising to phrenzy pitch! And in the same ratio intensified itself his scorn of my stupidity in not being able to discover <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> eggs <hi rend="italic">here</hi> &#x201C;at any season of the year!&#x201D; and his sacred horror of badness of egg-arrangements generally!! I had been listening to every van that passed our house, for two days; in trembling hope it would stop and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> eggs&#x201D; issue from it! Yesterday, being fine, a fine bright sunshine, before the frost and snow that were on the road; I went out for a little walk. On my return, while standing till the door was opened, I noticed the door steps all <hi rend="italic">trickled over</hi> with a thick buff colored fluid! &#x201C;What <hi rend="italic">can that</hi> be!&#x201D; I asked at Charlotte<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Southam, the Carlyles&#x2019; maid.</note> the moment she appeared&#x2014; &#x201C;Come in&#x2014; Oh do come in out of the cold Mam,&#x201D; said she coaxingly, and you shall know all about it!&#x2014; In the first place <hi rend="italic">There!</hi>&#x201D; she said, pointing to what shall I say? the ruins of a Box on one of the passage chairs! &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">That</hi> is the box you were expecting; and <hi rend="italic">People have been into it,</hi> and they say lots of the eggs are smashed; but it&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">my</hi> opinion they have taken them! Master came down, and told the man; he had better in Future read the address on boxes <hi rend="italic">before</hi> breaking into them! as if <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would bring back <hi rend="italic">the eggs, now!</hi>&#x201D; At last I got the state of the case out of her: The Carrier who brought the box from the railway had left it by mistake at 5 Cheyne Walk&#x2014;and the man of that house,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Tarte was listed as living at 5 Cheyne Walk.</note> who must be not the master, but in to keep it (from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s observation of his appearance) &#x201C;being expecting something himself&#x201C;&#x2014;proceeded to knock the lid in pieces, and finding what he did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> expect, looked at the address, tied all up anyhow and nohow, and brought it here&#x2014;marking his way with dripping of Egg, as, of yore, dear little Thom <pb id="pg-35-10" n="35:10"/>Thumb marked <hi rend="italic">his</hi> with bread crumbs!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The folk tale Tom Thumb.</note> Now my opinion is, &#x201C;the man&#x201D; had done nothing very heinous. It was the carrier who had the blame. Tell me how many eggs you put in. I took out, <hi rend="italic">whole,</hi> precisely 2 dozens&#x2014;but from the fact that only <hi rend="italic">four</hi> of these were in the first lair, and that the hay was quite soaked, I infer there must have been nearly as many again. What a cruel pity! Charlotte&#x2019;s notion that the man had &#x201C;taken a <hi rend="italic">rare lot</hi> to himself&#x201D; was founded on the fact that there was only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> broken empty shell amongst the hay! still the hay was saturated with egg, and the man had not thought it necessary, I suppose, to put back the broken shells he would first take out; besides the 2 dozen of eggs, there were 4 magnificent fowls, and a tongue&#x2014;(I wish it were an inspired one!)&#x2014;was that right? I am so sorry about the eggs&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">your</hi> disappointment and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s&#x2014;more than for my own&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that tongue</hi> will for many days leave <hi rend="italic">me</hi> nothing to wish for to my breakfast!&#x2014; I think the box had been loosened by the <hi rend="italic">division;</hi> and so the poor dear inestimable eggs had taken to polkaing on the road! besides perhaps <hi rend="italic">the man</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">did</hi> break a few himself, before he was sensible what kittle<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Delicate to handle.</note> ware he had to deal with! that is a less intolerable supposition than the one of his having <hi rend="italic">eaten</hi> them!</p>
<p>Oh my Dear! My Dear, what a Devil-to-pay time of it we have just now!&#x2014;The new volumes<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vols. 3 and 4 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great.</hi></note> don&#x2019;t seem in the way to being done a whit easier than the former ones! and meanwhile the Books and papers that are &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">lost</hi>&#x201D; every day&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">irretrievably lost! swept away into the abyss!</hi> Oh <hi rend="small-caps">con-found</hi> it! <hi rend="italic">No man was ever so situated!!</hi> and the book or paper missing, lying all the while before his nose! My Dear! I assure you it is enough, combined with the dark winter weather, and &#x201C;the general pressure of things,&#x201D; to make one invest a sixpence in arsenic! If one hadn&#x2019;t enjoyed the advantages of a presbyterian education! As an old rheumatic beggar-man said in his last illness, to our white-neckclothed Curate, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think I <hi rend="italic">shall regret the loss of myself!</hi>&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:243</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-04-15">15 April 1856</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here are two small Books, for the Post along with this: One the <hi rend="italic">Baron Munchausen</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Baron Munchausen&#x2019;s Narrative of His Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia</hi> (Oxford, [<date when="1785">1785</date>]) and <hi rend="italic">Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen</hi> (London, <date when="1792">1792</date>) are collections of tall tales supposedly by Hieronymous Karl Friedrich von Munchausen (<date when="1720">1720</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797">97</date>). TC is possibly sending <hi rend="italic">Sequel</hi>, as he refers to James Bruce of Kinnaird (<date when="1730">1730</date>&#x2013;<date when="1794">94</date>), African traveler and explorer, to whom <hi rend="italic">Sequel</hi> was dedicated.</note> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I never read in my life till the other ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) you will give to John,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably John Carlyle, son of James and Isabella Carlyle, with whom John was staying at Scotsbrig, or possibly John Aitken, 15-year-old son of Jean and James Aitken at Dumfries.</note> with my compliments, and wishes of &#x201C;much good may <hi rend="italic">it</hi> do him&#x201D;;&#x2014;young creatures did all read it, in my time; and it is a Book that will survive many! I wanted, in fine, to know what it was. An <hi rend="italic">English</hi> production I now find; date a little before my birth;&#x2014;who the author?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rudolph Erich Raspe (<date when="1737">1737</date>&#x2013;<date when="1794">94</date>) had compiled the Munchausen tales; the original authorship of the tales is uncertain, although many of them were probably written by Raspe himself.</note> Sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been known; but is not.

<p>I haggle along here, in my old way; much like a man doomed to <hi rend="italic">cobble shoes</hi> (the dreariest of enterprises, hope nowhere in it, except the hope of getting done with it): my progress is exceedingly below my intentions; in fact, is exceedingly bad; but I still persevere, tho&#x2019; falling on my nos[e] so often.

  <p>It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be an omen of much hope to me if Jamie<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle.</note> and you did find Whitecroft<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Whitecroft, a farm of 120 acres, Dalton parish of Dumfriesshire.</note> a thing worth buying!

    <p>By all accounts, in spite of the bad weather, you are much sounder and cheerier than you could have been in England; and we reasonably hope to see you return with a handsome stock of improvement in <pb id="pg-35-17" n="35:17"/>health,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lord Ashburton suffered from gout; Lady Louisa Ashburton wrote to her mother, <date when="1859-02-03">3 Feb.</date>: &#x201c;L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> A is <hi rend="italic">so</hi> much better&#x201d; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note>&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is, beyond doubt, one of the finest cargoes a man can return with from any voyage or adventure whatever! &#x201c;In May,&#x201d; her Ladyship said: we look out for you then,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss">They did not return to England until the end of July.</note> along with or before the hawthorne blossoming;&#x2014;and there is a certain individual ready for great amounts of horse-exercise in these favourable circumstances.</p>
    <p>We have had the muddiest tepidest winter I can remember to have seen: scarcely the least touch of frost (one or two mornings perhaps hoary, but the noon always muddy again) since you left us: very unwholesome, they say; but I confess, not so unpleasant to my old nerves as much of our frost here is; especially as that element of <hi rend="italic">frozen-fog,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> with smoke superadded, is the chosen product of London in winter time.</p>
    <p>I have seen &#x201c;nobody&#x201d; (almost literally) since you went away; I have led the life of a solitary galley-slave chained to his oar,&#x2014;with his own sad consent; that is most of the difference. All day, and every day, I sit aloft in my garret here; struggling sorrowfully with human stupidity, of my own and other people&#x02019;s,&#x2014;my job often not more &#x201c;genial&#x201d; than that of cobbling shoes w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be (indeed much of it, assorting, fixing patches, mending nonsenses, greatly reminds me of cobbling, and degrades me in my own mind into a dejected or indignant cobler feeling):&#x2014;precisely at half past 3 p.m. comes the horse; and I have had to ride, all this time, solitary amid the fogs of twilight, hither, thither, like a wandering ghost, on the <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> side of Styx (whispers one&#x02019;s evil genius sometimes)!

<p>Oh my poor dear little Woman! I declare I could put my arms round your neck, and <hi rend="italic">cry</hi> over you!&#x2014;about those eggs!&#x2014; If only, crying might mend <pb id="pg-35-22" n="35:22"/>broken eggs&#x2014;or broken anything!&#x2014;which it won&#x2019;t!&#x2014; The next thing I am tempted to do is to tell you a good round lie, smack-out! to describe the eggs as having arrived all whole this time; not so much as one cracked one among them. But what then? You would go on <hi rend="italic">believing</hi> in this principle of egg-packing! and practising it, on occasion, with such waste of the largest freshest beautifulest eggs in Creation, as is lamentable to think of!&#x2014; Besides, that I have <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> objection to telling lies, <hi rend="italic">when one isn&#x2019;t absolutely driven to</hi> it!! so here goes for the truth; little as it pleases me to tell it, or will please you to hear it! My Dear! <hi rend="italic">that</hi> box arrived all right outwardly; not a nail loosened in it&#x2014;no egg dripping out! and I took off the lid &#x201C;with my own hands&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280307-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:336</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-03-07">7 March 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and chisel. The first lair of hay being tenderly lifted off disclosed&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201C;immortal smash&#x201D;!!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420626-TC-TSS-01"><sic>14:210</sic><corr>TC to TSS, <date when="1842-06-26">26 June 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> certainly two thirds of that first lair of eggs had to be lifted with a spoon! some, clean spilt in the hay, &#x201C;could not be gathered!&#x201D; And so it went on to the bottom; in spite of your clever expedient of nailing the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">chuka</hi>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chicken.</note> to the box; so that <hi rend="small-caps">it</hi> had exercised no fatal influence on the rest of the contents. The result was not so desperate this time as last time however; tho&#x2019; as large a proportion of eggs were <hi rend="italic">broken</hi> there were not so many lost&#x2014;not above eight or ten quite <hi rend="italic">spilt</hi>&#x2014;all the rest, with more or less <hi rend="italic">in them,</hi> were put in a dish by themselves. and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am eating them poached or fried and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is having them in puddings. Now, tho&#x2019; I have told you the fact of the case dear Mary I wont have you vexing your kind heart about it. <hi rend="italic">Your</hi> part had been done with all the zeal and pains and generosity conceivable&#x2014;even to <hi rend="italic">prepaying the carriage</hi>&#x2014;which I declare to be a piece of <hi rend="italic">handsomeness</hi> perfectly unusual in this world! and which certainly nobody ever dreams of doing for <hi rend="italic">us</hi> except your magnanimous self! Besides there <hi rend="italic">are</hi> a great many <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> eggs to the fore! quite as many as will serve him for breakfast as long as they will be fresh&#x2014; Bless you it is not above a week since he had the last of the former escaped two dozen!!&#x2014; And there will be plenty to be had <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> fresh enough, by the time these are done. It is only in the middle of summer and in the middle of winter that the supply breaks down.</p>
<p>I will write you a letter of greater length and not <hi rend="italic">smeared over with egg,</hi> some day soon. Just now I am obliged to break off&#x2014;to prepare for a drive in &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">neat Fly</hi>&#x201D; which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has forced on me twice a week&#x2014;and the expense of which seems to me to greatly outride the project!</p>
<p>Bless you I can get a good jumble, 12 or fourteen miles long, for <hi rend="italic">one</hi> shilling, in a clean, roomy, Omnibus!&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">gentility</hi> is all the advantage on the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Fly</hi>&#x2019; side of the question! and really having been used to set <hi rend="italic">gentility</hi> at defiance when my years and my looks and my habits made such proceedings <pb id="pg-35-23" n="35:23"/>riskish for myself, and questionable in the eyes of others, I dont see why the deuce I should be told by M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> when nobody is at the trouble to think about or remark upon me, and when I myself am completely <hi rend="italic">habituated</hi> to self dependence&#x2014;that &#x201C;really my dear it is quite <hi rend="small-caps">improper</hi> for <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi> to be going in Omnibuses!! one should conform to the customs of the people one lives among!!&#x201D; Lord!

<salute>My dear Georgina</salute>
<p>The only thing I have to say for myself is, that it is better to be thanking you for your book thus late,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Lost and Won</hi> (<date when="1859">1859</date>) was reviewed by Geraldine Jewsbury: &#x201C;An improvement on Miss Craik&#x2019;s first work &#x2026; [the] story bespeaks a young writer, who has not much knowledge of life and nature to go upon, but making good use of all she has&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1859-03-12">12 March</date>, 354). For JWC&#x2019;s delays in acknowledging Georgiana Craik&#x2019;s first novel, <hi rend="italic">Riverton</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1857">1857</date>), see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571105-JWC-DD-01"><sic>33:113</sic><corr>JWC to DD, <date when="1857-11-05">5 Nov. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> but <hi rend="italic">after</hi> having read it; than to have adopted Talleyrand&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P&#xE9;rigord (<date when="1754">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838">1838</date>), French statesman and diplomat.</note> or Sir Walter Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">dodge</hi> (I have heard it imputed to both) of returning thanks on the instant; while merely &#x201C;hoping to read the book with the same pleasure with which I had received it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>From what your Father<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Lillie Craik.</note> told me, when he was here, about this second book, and from my own conviction about you; that you are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> one of what I call the <hi rend="italic">tea-pot-authoresses,</hi> who having infused <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the tea they had, or ever would have, pour one off a tolerable cup at the first pouring, and go on ever after adding new water to the same leaves, till it ends in sheer dishwashings!&#x2014; Confident that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would turn out to have a full tea-canister as well as <pb id="pg-35-24" n="35:24"/>a boiling kettle; I did not see any <hi rend="italic">imprudence</hi> in deferring my acknowledgement of the book, till there was full time to have read it, and until I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> read it.

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>If I dont take care I shall be falling into the self-same evil course I warned <hi rend="italic">you</hi> against in my last. &#x201C;Let him that standeth on the house-top take heed &#x26;c &#x26;c.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Cor. 10:12.</note> I don&#x2019;t think my brain is so active when I <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> (as I still continue to do with <hi rend="italic">that whisky!</hi>) as it used to be when I spent greater part of my nights in reading in my bed, to stave off insane thoughts! The fact is, anyhow, that my stupidity in these weeks approaches the sublime! and yet I dont get fat upon it; so I doubt if it be good, genuine, healthy stupidity, and not rather some physical torpor! Perhaps the explanation is<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC wrote &#x201C;is&#x201D; and &#x201C;were&#x201D;; it is unclear which is the original and which the correction.</note> comprised in the few frank words <pb id="pg-35-27" n="35:27"/>which D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Jeffson<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Dr. Henry Jephson (<date when="1798">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878">1878</date>) of Leamington Spa, who was consulted by many, including John Ruskin and members of nobility; he was famous for speaking bluntly, and stories and rhymes about him were widely circulated.</note> addressed to the would-be-young Dandy who consulted him; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">You are old&#x2014;yes damned old! that&#x2019;s all!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Did you ever see such a winter? I suppose it is good for weak lungs, but the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> here say, there never was more sickness&#x2014;only, the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> say <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> every winter, whether it be mild or severe! My poor Cousin at Falmouth fancies the climate there equal to that of Maidera, I question if it be Falmouth that makes the difference.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles had offered money to John Welsh for a trip to Madeira, hoping that the change in climate would relieve his worsening consumption, but he had chosen to go to Falmouth; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581021-JWC-JWEL-01"><sic>34:222&#x2014;23</sic><corr>JWC to JWEL, <date when="1858-10-21">21 Oct. 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note> Of course he is no better.

I have never seen so unintelligible a woman as M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> George Welsh.</p>
<p>I have another sorrow in the constant expectation of hearing from Haddington that the eldest<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Donaldson.</note> of my two dear old ladies is dead&#x2014; She has continued to live, and keep all her intellects and feelings as alive as ever, nobody knows how, for weeks back&#x2014;for she has lost the faculty of taking nourishment by which alone she was kept in life the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Thomas Howden (<date when="1812">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1900">1900</date>).</note> said. The other<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jess Donaldson.</note> can&#x2019;t survive her long; and then Haddington will be turned all into a church-yard for me!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am much obliged to you &#x26; to your young friends in Marischal College<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marischal Coll. was founded in <date when="1593">1593</date> as a Protestant university alongside the pre-Reformation King&#x2019;s Coll., founded <date when="1495">1495</date>. The two colleges were combined to form the University of Aberdeen, <date when="1860-09-00">Sept. 1860</date>.</note> but there are two reasons why, as appears to me, you ought not to proceed with your Nomination. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> is, That you have no good likelihood, so far as I can guess, of carrying your election.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had also been proposed for rector of Marischal Coll. in <date when="1850">1850</date>, but John Thomson Gordon (<date when="1818">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865">65</date>) was elected; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500222-TC-TAH-01"><sic>25:31</sic><corr>TC to TAH, <date when="1850-02-22">22 Feb. 1850</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500305-TC-JAC-01"><sic>38</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1850-03-05">5 March 1850</date></corr></ref>.</note> This is a very important preliminary reason!&#x2014;The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> is, That, being extremely busy in these months, and otherwise averse to travel, and in truth an enemy rather than a friend to Public Haranguing, as at present practiced,&#x2014;I do not think it likely I could get to Aberdeen on such an errand, even if you were unexpectedly successful.</p>
<p>Pray desist, therefore. To me the honour is without importance at this stage of my life<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1866">1866</date> he consented to stand for rector of Edinburgh Univ. and defeated Benjamin Disraeli by 657 votes to 310.</note>&#x2014;and in fact has no value at all, except as testifying your regard to me, of which I can now otherwise hold myself assured. And to you have not I already &#x2018;spoken,&#x2019;&#x2014;to such of you as cared to listen,&#x2014;and, with a great deal of deliberation, given you the truest advice I had!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Accept many thanks from me; and believe, all of you, voters for and voters against, that nobody, elected or eligible,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Graham Drummond, 7th earl of Airlie, husband of JWC&#x2019;s friend Blanche, became rector of Marischal Coll., <date when="1859">1859</date>.</note> can wish you more truly than I do, continual increase of intelligence and of all the nobleness that should go along with it. <closer><salute>And so, with sincere regards and thanks, I remain / Yours faithfully, /</salute></closer> <name>T Carlyle</name></p>

I received your Note of the <date when="1858-02-08">8<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> last, with the inclosed Cash,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The interest on TC&#x2019;s American investments; both payments in <date when="1858">1858</date> were &#xa3;14; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580609-TC-CBU-01"><sic>265</sic><corr>TC to CBU, <date when="1858-06-09">9 June 1858</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580923-TC-CBU-01"><sic>34:199</sic><corr>TC to CBU, <date when="1858-09-23">23 Sept. 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note> which the Banker has now got hold of: that is all right; and I have only to return you many thanks as usual,&#x2014;the poor but sole return in my power as matters stand.</p>
<p>On the other hand I perceive you have never got my last Letter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had written <date when="1858-09-23">23 Sept. 1858</date>; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580923-TC-CBU-01"><sic>34:198&#x2014;99</sic><corr>TC to CBU, <date when="1858-09-23">23 Sept. 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note> written 5 or 6 months ago (end of Sept<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> I should guess)? I posted it myself; and long ago, as no answer came to the inquiries there made, I began to fancy something had misgone; which, by your silence on the matter this time too, I perceive is the case.

<p>The lost Letter treated of some money I meant for the American Funds under your guidance,&#x2014;of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> there was long ago talk between us. &#xa3;1,000 I had, and then another &#xa3;1,000:&#x2014;not hearing from you, I fancied you really might be at a loss to point out any absolutely good investment, or to risk an advice; I therefore proceeded to invest those two sums in English stock: &#x201C;Brighton-Railway Debentures&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had invested &#xa3;4,000 in Brighton Debentures, <date when="1858-11-12">12 Nov. 1858</date> (TC&#x2019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).</note> they call one of them; some other similar thing the other: and there my <hi rend="italic">peculiar</hi> [savings] lie, absolutely <hi rend="italic">safe</hi> I am told, <pb id="pg-35-41" n="35:41"/>but yielding only <hi rend="italic">4 per cent,</hi> tho&#x2019; perhaps I expected about 5.&#x2014;&#x2014; Well, if I missed any better American chance by that Post-Office accident, there still remains another &#xa3;1,000, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you may yet advise about if you like!

<p><salute>Dear Sir</salute>&#x2014;I have received your book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Healing Art, the Right Hand of the Church, or Practical Medicine an Essential Element in the Christian System</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1859">1859</date>), pbd. by Sutherland &#x26; Knox. Brodie&#x2019;s aim was to &#x201C;ascertain what data are furnished by Scripture to warrant the recognition of scientific and practical Medicine as an essential element in the Christian system, an indispensable agency in the activity which the Church is called on to sustain in the world&#x201D; (8).</note> which you were kind enough to send me, and I beg to return you thanks for the same. It is a book (unlike many that come to me here) of a serious nature, the fruit of long study, meditation, inquiry, and evidently of perfect conviction on your part.</p>
<p>I believe, and have long believed, the essential idea it sets forth to be not only true, but of the very highest importance to mankind, namely, that the Physican must first of all be a priest (that is to say, a man of pious nobleness, devoted to the service of the Highest, and prepared to endure and endeavour for that same, taking no counsel of flesh, and blood, as the theory of Priests is),&#x2014;first of all, a real priest, and than<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a misprint for &#x201C;then.&#x201D;</note> that the whole world should take supreme counsel of him, as it does of its real or imaginary Priests or Pontiffs this long while back, and follow said counsel as the actual will of God,&#x2014;which it would be were the Physician what I say.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-35-45" n="35:45"/>It is curious to remark that Heilig in our old Teutonic speech is both Holy and also Healthy; that the words Holy and Healthy, as our antique fathers understood them, are one and the same. A thousand times has that etymology risen sorrowfully upon me, in looking at the present distracted position of affairs, which is horrible to think of, if we look earnestly into it, and which cannot well be spoken of at all. We, sure enough, have completely contrived to divorce holiness (as we call it) from health, and have been reaping the fruits very plentifully during these fifteen hundred years.</p>
<p>The notion of bringing our present distracted anomaly of a Physician into union with our ditto ditto of a Priest, and making them identical, is, of course, extremely chimerical; nor can one easily say what ought to be the first step towards bringing each of them back from his anomalous imaginary condition and nearer to veracity, and the possibility of coalescing. But I am very glad to see the idea started, in any form, under any vesture, and heartily wish you success in bringing it home to men&#x2019;s minds.</p>

<salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
<p>You are very good; and it would give me great pleasure to come and pay my respects to you,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Chatterton lived at 5 Seamore Pl., Mayfair.</note>&#x2014;which I hope will one day be my fortune. But at present, and for the last two years,&#x2014;owing to excess of occupation, weak health, and other causes,&#x2014;I am totally cut off from such recreations; and for many months to come I have nothing to look for but grim seclusion, and an employment analogous to beating of hemp, with a whip swung over one!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dearest Betty</salute>
<p>I shouldn&#x2019;t wonder if you were wearying to hear from me! I know that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am wearying to hear from <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> and there isn&#x2019;t much hope of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> till I have first put you in my debt.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-35-48" n="35:48"/>The fact is I have a far wider correspondence on my hands than is either profitable or pleasant; and there are so few hours in the day that I can give to writing, being subject to continual interruptions in the forenoons, and in the afternoons too wearied for anything but lying on a sofa betwixt sleeping and waking. Ach! I remember &#x201C;Tom Dodds&#x201D; telling M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Brown (you remember M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Brown?)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Dods, a schoolfriend of JWC; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570919-JWC-WDO-01"><sic>33:88</sic><corr>JWC to WDO, [<date when="1857-09-19">19 Sept. 1857</date>]</corr></ref>.

Acts 9:5.</note> but to just creep along as I can! Indeed I should rather be thankful that I am got so far in the road to wellness, that I am now <hi rend="italic">capable</hi> of <hi rend="italic">resting</hi> and leaving the rest to shift for itself&#x2014; In the beginning of my bad health, the feverish inclination to overfatigue myself, and the wide-awakeness day and night was the worst part of my disease. And besides this bodily languor and weariedness, I really have now little to complain of&#x2014; I keep free of colds&#x2014;have not <hi rend="italic">coughed</hi> since November! and I get some reasonably good sleep&#x2014;ever since I returned from Scotland<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1858-09-29">29 Sept. 1858</date>.</note> and took to drinking&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">whisky toddy!</hi> Don&#x2019;t be alarmed! I never increase my doze, and it is but <hi rend="italic">one tablespoonful</hi> (of <hi rend="italic">whisky</hi> that is) before going to bed.</p>
<p>For the rest; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is hard at work as usual, and the house would be dull enough, if it were not for the plenty of people&#x2014;often more than enough&#x2014;who come to see me in the forenoons, and for Charlottes young, dancing spirits and face radiant with good humour and kindliness all day long! And the strange little Being has so much sense and reflection in her, that she is quite as good to talk with as most of the fine Ladies that come about me.&#x2014; Sometimes I go out for a drive, and stay to Luncheon (which is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> dinner) with some friend or other; to shake the cobwebs off my brain, which are apt to gather there when I sit too much at home! Last Tuesday I spent two or three hours at George Rennie&#x2019;s! Oh you can&#x2019;t fancy what an old worn-looking man he is grown. He has a grand house,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Rennie and his family lived at 32 York Ter., Regent&#x2019;s Park.</note> and his cousin Jane <pb id="pg-35-49" n="35:49"/>whom he married (instead of <hi rend="italic">me</hi>) seems to make him a devoted Wife;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For JWC&#x2019;s earlier opinions of Jane Rennie, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340800-JWC-EA-01"><sic>7:253</sic><corr>JWC to EA, [ca. <date when="1834-08-00">Aug. 1834</date>]</corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551021-JWC-J-01"><sic>30:248</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-04-28">28 April 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> but his life is not a happy one I think.

<p><salute>Dear Sir,</salute>&#x2014; N&#xB0;, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> kind of paper, is to me much the pleasantest; but my experiments are not yet completed; and indeed I <hi rend="italic">fled</hi> from some kinds (with a sort of terror) to my safe dim old straw-paper again!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s previous coments on straw-paper, see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581102-TC-JN-01"><sic>34:237</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1858-11-02">2 Nov. 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note> I will not fix on any at pres<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> lest I get <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> when trying it on the great scan.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am sorry to hear of your distresses, of your want of work especially. In help of that kind you propose I am already well supplied; and fear I shall have little or no use for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> services,&#x2014;the rather as my present Task requires a ready knowledge of German to do much good in it, and French at least is entirely indispensable.</p>

<p>I am very glad to see your handwriting again; and was affected in heart as well as practically obliged by the kind Gift you sent me from your sickroom.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grant had suffered from poor health for several years; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440623-TC-HGR-01"><sic>18:79</sic><corr>TC to HGR, <date when="1844-06-23">23 June 1844</date></corr></ref>; he d. in May.</note> Such a mess<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the sense of a large quantity.</note> of Paper, all honestly made out of linen rags (as I perceive by this specimen), is a singular rarity in these days; and I mean to have my <hi rend="italic">uses</hi> out of it by and by.</p>
<p>Nobody can compute the ridiculous but great and real sufferings I have had in regard to Paper, for the last 20 years! Ever since you ceased from my localities, I have been without pilot, in that bad matter, and have merely gone from sandbank to sandbank. If anybody, when I first entered London, had chopped 3 of my fingers off, and said, &#x201C;Now I undertake that Paper, pens, ink, shall stand <hi rend="italic">un</hi>improved during your lifetime!&#x201D; what a blessed bargain it had been in comparison!&#x2014; About seven years ago, I was fairly drawn into <hi rend="italic">iron pens;</hi> and go on in that fashion ever since,&#x2014;cursing my stars rather less audibly than formerly; and I believe I must continue in the iron way (with dirty <hi rend="italic">straw</hi>-paper &#x26;c), not to change too often. I still keep bad goose-quills (as you may notice); and no &#x201C;pen&#x201D; can replace to me some that I have had of your cutting, the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> fairly good that were appointed me.</p>
<p>It is very sad all this that you have to report of yourself in the bodily way: such sufferings, I have often thought, are the most unmanageable that are laid upon clear-minded human creatures in this world. &#x201C;Healthy,&#x201D; in old German, is the selfsame word as &#x201C;Holy&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s etymology is correct; see also <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590225-TC-THE-01">TC to <sic>T [DB]</sic><corr>THE</corr>, <date when="1859-02-25">25 Feb.</date></ref></note>&#x2014;and so in Nature I find the fact really to be; widely as we have wandered from it in our ways in this world!&#x2014;&#x2014;One thing I perceive to be as good as certain: the fine weather, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> must be now at the threshold, will be <hi rend="italic">greatly</hi> in favour of your kind of complaint; I promise myself all kinds of results out of this in the course of a month or two.</p>
<p>My Wife is usually one of the weakest of creatures (want of <hi rend="italic">sleep,</hi> want of &#x26;c &#x26;c); but this warm winter she is decidedly better than in either of the last two.

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I might sometimes seize a five minutes (as now), and write you a small word, merely to keep your imagination quiet: but the truth is, the opportunity does but seldom occur; and when it does, I am not so prompt with it as I could once have been.</p>

<salute>My dearest Mary</salute>
<p>You could not conceive, without having been beside me, the hindrances I have found to answering your letter ever since it came to hand; for Nature prompted me to answer at once&#x2014; You were sad&#x2014;and a letter from me might cheer you a bit&#x2014;the bare chance was quite sufficient to set me on writing without loss of a single post&#x2014;if only &#x2018;the Devil and his Grandmother&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

But, on the principle that &#x201C;it never rains but it pours,&#x201D; this house has been &#x201C;like a cried fair&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A fair that has been publicly proclaimed.</note> for the last three days; or rather like the Siege of Sebastopale!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The siege of Sebastopol during the Crimean War lasted 387 days, <date when="1854">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855">55</date>.</note> This is the third day that I have had company (improvised,&#x2014;of their &#x201C;own sweet will&#x201D;)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>To night our last visitor (the anything but interesting son<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Aitken.</note> of my Sister-in-law at Dumfries) has left early, having mercifully a great distance to travel) and I snatched up my pen, before the street-door had closed on him, and surely I will now get a letter written; to be despatched tomorrow. Nobody else can well interrupt me tonight, as the clocks are this instant striking ten.</p>
<p>My Dear I am so much obliged to you for liking to write to me when you are <hi rend="italic">sad.</hi> It is a proof of affection, <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> which can be depended on. Fancy <hi rend="italic">my</hi> writing to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Pringle.</note> when I felt sad&#x2014;the thing would be impossible!&#x2014;tho she wrote me, I must own, I nice long letter the other day with no flumery in it &#x201C;to speak of&#x201D;! Just a few <hi rend="italic">phrases</hi> about Mary Welsh&#x2019;s marriage<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s cousin Mary May Welsh married at Janet Pringle&#x2019;s home, Lann Hall, nr.

I did not think Mary Welsh by any means a wise woman, when I saw her for the first time last summer, but this going to Lann <hi rend="italic">Hall</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">married</hi> proves her very much of a fool. It is quite of a piece with the <hi rend="italic">bonnet</hi> she had bought herself in London, (lilac satin all bedizened with white paste beads&#x2014;and worn along with a rusty black gown!)&#x2014; My Cousin John<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh the meteorologist.</note> is quite scandalised at the slight to her Mother&#x2019;s house<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Welsh lived at 250 St. George&#x2019;s Rd., Glasgow.</note>&#x2014; He is quite another sort of a Cousin poor fellow&#x2014;worth all my cousins tied up in one bundle! and <hi rend="italic">him</hi> I must make up my mind to lose! He talks of being &#x2018;stationary&#x2019;&#x2014; But his Doctor<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Bence Jones.</note> has not a hope of him&#x2014;nor could any one <hi rend="italic">hope,</hi> who had looked in his face and heard his voice&#x2014;and his cough&#x2014; But it is the line both he and his Mother have taken; never to admit that he gets worse. My poor old Miss Donaldson is still lingering on, her mind as clear, her heart as warm as ever!&#x2014;but no rallying nor chance of rallying (they write)&#x2014;and suffering much from sleeplessness, and nervous distress. She sends me the fondest assurances of her &#x201C;affection, that will abide to the last&#x201C;&#x2014;bids her poor sister write and tell me this and that, and Miss Jess writes&#x2014;with what a sorrowful heart you can <pb id="pg-35-59" n="35:59"/>figure! I open every letter from Haddington with a shudder. One day, lately Charlotte brought me <hi rend="italic">four</hi> letters, altogether, on a plate, and every on[e] (I could see so soon as she came into the room) with a broad black border! The sight made me <hi rend="italic">sick,</hi> but it was a false alarm&#x2014;there was no bad <hi rend="italic">news,</hi> with all that influx of <hi rend="italic">black.</hi> It is strange how the most absurd things will recur to ones mind along with the most solemn.</p>
<p>I am reminded this moment of a thing Old Sir George Sinclair (Sir <hi rend="italic">Gorg Synkler</hi> as dear old Betty<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid.</note> spells him) told me the other day as an authentic fact. We were talking about the hardship of living with a bad wife! (Lady Clementina<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Catherine Camilla.</note> is said to have thrown much light for him on that subject) Sir George said an old acquaintance of his own being at the point of death, a mutual friend (Kinaird<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> I think was the name) went to take leave of him, and found him wonderfully cheerful. &#x201C;I am glad&#x201D; he said &#x201C;to see you meeting death so bravely! Have you then no fear of <hi rend="italic">the King of Terrors?</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh no!&#x201D; said the dying man, I have lived for five and forty years beside <hi rend="italic">the Queen of Terrors;</hi> I need fear <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> after that!&#x201D;</p>
<p>My little Charlotte continues to be a great temporal blessing to me. Proof against &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Spoiling.</hi>&#x2019; But I have my own ideas about &#x201C;spoiling servants,&#x201D; and seen no cause yet to modify or change them. The &#x201C;spoiling&#x201D; I give Charlotte for example is no such <hi rend="italic">easy</hi> matter as you may think&#x2014;for I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> common sense enough to know that a mistress must keep up her <hi rend="italic">authority</hi> over her servants or it will be the worse for her!&#x2014; and if the character of the servant be of a sort that cannot be acted upon by <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> means, or if the Mistress is incapable or will not take the trouble to use moral means; why then there should be recourse to mechanical ones. I mean if one cannot or will not take the trouble to keep up a <hi rend="italic">respect</hi> in the servant, why then, one must what they call <hi rend="italic">keep up one&#x2019;s dignity</hi><note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350800-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>8:193</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, [<date when="1835-08-00">mid Aug. 1835</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> with her. Now, how often it is just to ones servants and to them only that one shows all ones faults&#x2014;because it would be too much constraint to be always showing a fair outside to <hi rend="italic">them,</hi> and because <hi rend="italic">they</hi> dont seem worth the bother of putting constraint on oneself&#x2014; If one is to treat a servant indulgently humanly, <hi rend="italic">fellow-creaturely,</hi> one must show her at the same time the best of oneself&#x2014;not the worst, and substitute the real respect one inspires for the conventional respect one does not exact. Thus one must be content to wear in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> presence the same moral straight-waistcoat one doesn&#x2019;t mind wearing in the presence of a lover, or valued friend. Moreover one must first of all satisfy oneself of the servants <hi rend="italic">capacity</hi> <pb id="pg-35-60" n="35:60"/>for respect&#x2014; With a fool or a creature without sensibility better stick to the keeping-up-one&#x2019;s-dignity system&#x2014;</p>
<p>But Charlotte is full of intellect and imagination and feeling. The best piece of stuff I ever got, to &#x201C;make a spoon or spoil a horn&#x201D;<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> with&#x2014; And I assure you I never took more <hi rend="italic">trouble</hi> to gain the <hi rend="italic">esteem</hi> and affection of man or woman than I have taken to gain hers&#x2014; In return I have the behaviour of an obedient, dutiful affectionate <hi rend="italic">Adopted Child</hi> from her How long it may last so, I do not pretend to foretell&#x2014;as I cannot forsee what other influences may be brought to bear on her&#x2014;or how long my <hi rend="italic">infallibility</hi> may hold out for her&#x2014;</p>
<p>There! if that isn&#x2019;t moralyzing enough for one time!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have been wearying for a Letter of late, and expecting one from morning to morning; but none comes. The reason, when I reflect, is plainly twofold: most probably I myself am in arithmetical arrear; and in the second place there is probably nothing at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> that presses to be said.&#x2014; I have come up stairs, however, to write to you this night; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is the next best thing.</p>
<p>You asked me once about poor John Welsh; and I doubt I made no answer. The truth is, we know little of him, except in general the sad fact, that he is wearing weaker; that Bence Jones has no hope of him, and considers that, since autumn last, all efforts are intrinsically useless or worse. He (B. Jones) wrote twice to Jane, to that effect in very delicate tones, not long after you left, and probably in consequence of your visit to him. John Welsh too wrote to the like practical purport, and seemed almost provoked that the matter should be stirred farther. Jane has had at most two other Letters from him; very distinct, quiet, brave; giving graphic descriptions of the Fox people<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anna Maria and Caroline Fox and their Quaker family in Falmouth.</note> and their ways, who are very kind to him; and saying little, in the way of complaint nothing, about his own situation: the winter temperature very favourable to him; nothing <hi rend="italic">sensibly</hi> worse; daily or almost daily walks, sometimes near an hour; cough troublesome &#x26;c. From his Mother&#x2019;s Letters wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are more frequent <pb id="pg-35-62" n="35:62"/>there can nothing be gathered, except incidentally; poor woman she tries to speak always in the language of cheerfulness, tho&#x2019; one can see that there is no hope in her. Most of the Fox people are off lately towards Rome; but one, an old Naturalist,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Robert Were Fox, Anna and Caroline&#x2019;s father.</note> very good and honest, is still left. Poor John &#x26; his Mother propose to return to Richmond soon;&#x2014;and it was by the Mother&#x2019;s anxiety about the first part of this journey (40 miles <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in railway) that we drew our saddest inferences last time she wrote. Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But I must tell you about Butler&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Butler.</note> Letter, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is here inclosed. He is my American who did the last Yankee Bond<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the Illinois bond, see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540117-TC-CBU-01"><sic>29:21</sic><corr>TC to CBU, <date when="1854-01-17">17 Jan. 1854</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560819-TC-CBU-01"><sic>34:261</sic><corr>TC to CBU, <date when="1856-08-19">19 Aug. 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> in the way you know: an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> old gent<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> to judge by physiognomy, and by other tests that have come in my way: had I got this Letter at the time I expected one and got none,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly in early <date when="1858">1858</date>; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580609-TC-CBU-01"><sic>34:265&#x2013;66</sic><corr>TC to CBU, <date when="1858-06-09">9 June 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note> I had probably sent all my cash for him to invest. As it is, I will now make no change in the Debentures and Preference Shares (4 per cent each);<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590224-TC-CBU-01">TC to <sic>CB</sic><corr>CBU</corr>, <date when="1859-02-24">24 Feb.</date></ref></note> but I mean to send Butler another &#xa3;1,000 wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I still have: except that the <hi rend="italic">interest</hi> is so extremely <hi rend="italic">good,</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Butler had written, <date when="1856-08-04">4 Aug. 1856</date>, that he could buy bonds with a return of &#x201C;about 10%&#x201D; (MS: NLS 1767.134).</note> I have not the least reason to question his judgement. He works in that business as his trade, is thoroughly well affected to <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> and I found him a prudent considerate kind of character &#x26; much the gentleman in appearance, manners &#x26; conduct. So the &#xa3;1,000, I suppose, must go, <hi rend="italic">tho&#x2019;</hi> at &#xa3;70 annually. You perceive he has still room for 2 other <hi rend="italic">Thousands:</hi> but I confess I am almost rather glad the others (of mine) are quietly settled, on different bottoms; so that it will take <hi rend="italic">three</hi> thunderbolts to sink them <hi rend="italic">all.</hi>&#x2014; For the rest, I design to try if <hi rend="italic">Adamson</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Adamson, TC&#x2019;s Dumfries banker.</note> cannot manage both to send the money for me, and to gather up from Butler all the <hi rend="italic">legal</hi> threads (both of this sum and of the former one), so as to hold good <hi rend="italic">vouchers</hi> in case of any accident to me or to B<hi rend="italic">r,</hi>&#x2014;and on the whole to <hi rend="italic">trouble</hi> me no farther with the thing at all, except by receiving the half-yearly dividends.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Butler sent interest every Feb. and Aug.; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560819-TC-CBU-01"><sic>34:261&#x2013;65</sic><corr>TC to CBU, <date when="1856-08-19">19 Aug. 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> For the rest, I will do nothing, not even write to Adamson, <hi rend="italic">till I hear from from</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word repeated at turn of page.</note> <hi rend="italic">you.</hi> Pray <hi rend="italic">read</hi> Butler then; and return him to me; so soon as you have come to clear understanding about it.</p>

Although slavery was not abolished in Dominica until <date when="1834">1834</date>, the Brown Privilege Bill, <date when="1832">1832</date>, had abolished all discrimination on grounds of color for all free people, and by <date when="1838">1838</date> Dominica had become the first and only British Caribbean colony where white Europeans did not control the legislature, mounting the first successful challenge to white rule in the Caribbean. In his letter to TC, <date when="1856-05-10">10 May 1856</date>, Ker wrote that Dominica was &#x201C;the most villainous community in the entire British Dominions&#x201D; and that &#x201C;the Mulattoes&#x201D; wanted &#x201C;to drive the whites out of the island and get everything into their own hands&#x201D; (MS: NLS 1767.109).</note> Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of13 members;<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dominica was a British colony, administered as part of the Leeward Islands since <date when="1833">1833</date> with a lieut. gov. appointed by the crown; its Legislative Council of seven members was appointed by the governor on behalf of the crown, and its House of Assembly of 19 representatives elected by the people (Colonial Office Papers; National Archives at Kew: CO 380/44).</note> 1 mu[l]atto tinsmith the <hi rend="italic">Derby</hi><note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Derby, the British prime minister.

Surrey, <date when="1847">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860">60</date>, and an apostle of the Catholic Apostolic Church. TC is possibly referring to Charles Gordon Falconer (<date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872">72</date>), a shrewd and charismatic leader of the Mulatto Ascendancy (an unofficial political party), members of which formed the majority in the House of Assembly in <date when="1859">1859</date>. Falconer established and edited the <hi rend="italic">Dominican</hi> in opposition to the <hi rend="italic">Colonist</hi>; a vociferous and evangelical Methodist, he opposed Roman Catholicism and state funding of religion. In his letter to TC, <date when="1856-05-10">10 May 1856</date>, Alan Ker described him as a &#x201C;mulatto incendiary&#x201D; whose &#x201C;power is omnipotent over his own class&#x201D; (NLS: MS 1767.109).</note> and one hon. member a whit[e] specimen.<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> It is not worth a farthing to her Majesty as at present managed<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Since it became a British colony a succession of lieut. govs. had found the island notoriously difficult to manage. The often conflicting influences of French and British colonizers and Dominica&#x2019;s history of slavery created complex social relations, of which skin color, religion (Protestant and Roman Catholic), and language (French and English) were an integral part (see Patrick L. Baker, <hi rend="italic">Centring the Periphery</hi> [Montreal and Kingston, <date when="1994">1994</date>] 128). The two main groups within Dominica&#x2019;s political and social elite were the white administrators, officials, and estate owners, and the mainly French mulatto families, many of whom owned estates and slaves but who, until <date when="1831">1831</date>, had been banned from participating in government (see Lennox Honychurch, <hi rend="italic">The Dominica Story</hi> [<date when="1995">1995</date>] 127&#x2013;29). With the entry of nonwhites into the Assembly the atmosphere became combative. In <date when="1850">1850</date> only a fifth of Dominica&#x2019;s population was literate (see Borom&#xE9; 28); the need for legislation to improve public welfare (particularly that of ex-slaves) became caught up in the power struggle between the elite groups and the interests of the British govt. The <hi rend="italic">Antigua Weekly Register</hi> reported in <date when="1858">1858</date> that the &#x201C;political disputes, engendering social discord and strife&#x201D; of Dominica were now so common that they had &#x201C;cease[d] to attract even an ordinary degree of attention&#x201D; (quoted in Honychurch 27). Many of the white minority saw the solution to the problem as single-chamber govt., which was successfully opposed by the Mulatto Ascendancy until the <date when="1860">1860</date>s. Dominica&#x2019;s economy was also poor. Revenue for <date when="1858">1858</date> was &#xa3;13,500, &#xa3;7,000 of which was owed to the British govt. in repayment of the capital and interest on an <date when="1845">1845</date> hurricane relief loan. In <date when="1857-06-00">June 1857</date>, the House of Assembly had asked the lt. gov., Maj. Henry St. George Ord (<date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885">85</date>), to petition Parliament to cancel the debt; in exchange the legislature would spend that amount on public works. At the same Assembly meeting, the Education Commissioners reported that in the first year of the Education Act (<date when="1857">1857</date>) only &#xa3;440 had been spent on education (two-thirds of the sum that should have been spent), due to shortage of funds. Money was also needed to finance repairs to roads (Colonial Office Papers; National Archives at Kew: CO 74/31). Ord reported, <date when="1859-01-04">4 Jan. 1859</date>, that he had strongly supported the proposal to cancel the hurricane loan debt but the British govt. insisted that repayment was &#x201C;from the first &#x2026; a positive condition of the loan&#x201D; (CO 74/31). An arrangement was eventually made whereby the loan was paid back over a period of 20 years.</note> (they have to send f[or]<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The MS was taped together at some point and the removal of the tape has taken off the ink of the words and letters noted above in brackets.</note> Frenchmen even to quench riots,&#x2014;and a boat&#x2019;s crew with cutlasses c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take it at any time.<note n="24" place="bottom" type="gloss" >British defenses in the colony were acknowledged to be inadequate; in <date when="1859-01-00">Jan. 1859</date>, on the instructions of the British govt., Ord had raised the question of the establishment of a militia or volunteer force for the defense of the colony. He complained that govt. buildings were so badly defended that &#x201C;constant plundering means that there is nothing of a portable nature left&#x201D; (Colonial Office Papers; National Archives at Kew: CO 74/31). Dominica&#x2019;s closest neighbors, the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, would probably have had greater resources to use against insurgents because historically the French had established stronger defenses to protect their colonies (see Patrick L. Baker, <hi rend="italic">Centring the Periphery</hi> [Montreal and Kingston, (<date when="1994">1994</date>)] 77).</note></p>

<p><salute>Dear Thackeray,</salute>&#x2014;Thanks for your merry little Note and the two Pens.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s letter is in reply to Thackeray&#x2019;s note: &#x201C;What do you think, most hard-to-please of men, / Of William Mitchell&#x2019;s patent broad-nibbed pen? / I&#x2019;ve bought a box&#x2014;three shilling for the gross&#x2014; / At Mitchell&#x2019;s Stationer&#x2019;s in Charing Cross. / Try these: and if you like the pens, I&#x2019;ll trouble you / To write to 36.

Thackeray lived at 36 Onslow Sq.</note> It is like a little pearl of human cheerfulness and friendliness, turning up for one in the dreary wash of commonplace and botheration, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is one&#x2019;s common lot!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have been true as Mitchell&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Otho Mitchell, 39 Charing Cross.</note> own steel to his Pens and him these many years; not even the Pair you sent me to Scotland<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1856">1856</date>; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560807-TC-JWC-01"><sic>31:155</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1856-08-07">7 Aug. 1856</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560807-TC-LA-01"><sic>157</sic><corr>TC to LA, <date when="1856-08-07">7 Aug. 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> could seduce my faithful <hi rend="italic">hand,</hi> for above a day or two. &#x201C;Letter J&#x201D; I find to be the right article: &#x201C;R&#x201D; I use for addressing Packets. Try these two &#x201C;J&#x2019;s,&#x201D; both in slantindicular and perpen-d<hi rend="italic">o,</hi> they perform well.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thackeray wrote in a postscript: &#x201C;I think they seem to suit better for the upright, than the slantingdicular writing.&#x201D; Ray noted: &#x201C;This sentence is written in Thackeray&#x2019;s slanting hand, the rest of the letter is in his upright hand&#x201D; (Ray 4:147).</note></p>
<p>And observe farther, <hi rend="italic">here</hi> is a kind of Paper, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I find the best of many for suiting Mitchell. Try that too: it is made partly of <hi rend="italic">straw;</hi>&#x2014;smooth enough; <pb id="pg-35-68" n="35:68"/>and bites at the ink with an appetite one likes. &#x201C;Parkins &#x26; Gotto&#x201D; Stationers;&#x2014;and I will send you a ream of it whenever you hold up your finger.</p>
<p>Oh that I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> see a gentleman with a sweet smile on his face walking past my table, equipped in the corresponding way!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thackeray wrote in a second postscript: &#x201C;A gentleman has just passed my table with a sweet smile on his face, and in his hand the last number of THE V.RG.N..NS [Virginians]&#x201D; (Ray 4:147). W. M. Thackeray, <hi rend="italic">The Virginians</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1858">1858</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">59</date>), was pbd. in monthly installments in London by Bradbury &#x26; Evans, <date when="1857-11-00">Nov. 1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-10-00">Oct. 1859</date>, and in New York in <hi rend="italic">Harper&#x2019;s New Monthly Magazine</hi>, <date when="1857-11-00">Nov. 1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-10-00">Oct. 1859</date>. Thackeray presumably means the most recent issue, while TC means he would like to see a gentleman carrying the last vol. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi></note> But I often think this villainous bottomless confusion (worthless to gods and men) will kill me first.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>&#x2014;Long months ago there was sent off for you a Copy of <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi> of Prussia, Two big red Volumes<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1859-05-01">1 May</date>, that he was &#x201C;heartily glad to get the Crimson Book itself&#x201D;; he had looked for it sooner, and when it did not arrive he presumed himself punished for his &#x201C;sluggish contumacy.&#x201D; He had read the American reprint and had referred to it in his lecture &#x201C;Art and Criticism,&#x201D; <date when="1859-04-13">13 April</date>, Music Hall, Boston. When the book arrived with &#x201C;its irresistible inscription&#x201D; he was &#x201C;all tenderness and all but tears&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 527). Emerson had referred to his &#x201C;long contumacy to-you-ward&#x201D; in his letter, <date when="1858-05-27">27 May 1858</date> (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 520).</note> (for wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Chapman the Publisher had found some &#x201C;safe swift&#x201D; vehichle); and <hi rend="italic">now</hi> I have reason to fear they are still loitering somewhere, or at least have long loitered; sorrow on them!

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>I confess I have been remiss in writing to you; shamefully so, if you did not know the circumstances, or believe in them without knowing!

The truth is I have [been]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted by TC.</note> swimming in bottomless Abysses, whipt and whirled about as man never was, for long years past; and there are still many months of it ahead:&#x2014;it was <hi rend="italic">after</hi> all this should have once rolled itself away, that I always meant to write to you; a free man once more (no Prussian or other rubbish crushing the life out of me); <hi rend="italic">till</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> fine consummation, tho&#x2019; my conscience did a little bark upon me now and then, it barked to no purpose as you have seen! This is the true history of that phenomenon; &#x26; I leave it with you.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-35-70" n="35:70"/>As I said, there are months and twelvemont[h]s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> still of that sad Prussian Operation pressing on me; and one knows not how long the foolish speechlessness might have lasted,&#x2014;had it not been for a message that arrived this morning, the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> here inclosed; which cannot brook being neglected by me. I shove <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi> aside therefore (more luck to him); and hasten, with a bad or good grace, to do the needful.</p>
<p>Please read carefully that inclosed Letter from Macready<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Macready to TC, <date when="1859-04-13">13 April</date>, asking for help in getting his son Edward work in Australia.</note> to me: it will bring the whole case accurately before you; and if you can do anything in it, I will earnestly request you, for my sake withal, to do it with your best might. I know not if you are aware, as I am, that the <hi rend="italic">private</hi> worth and merits of Mr Macready senior are of the highest order; a man of scrupulous veracity, correctness, integrity,&#x2014;a kind of <hi rend="italic">Grandisonian</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The model gentlemanly hero of Samuel Richardson&#x2019;s novel <hi rend="italic">The History of Sir Charles Grandison</hi> (<date when="1753">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1754">54</date>).</note> style of magnanimity, both in substance and manner, visible in all his conduct;&#x2014;I have often said, Looking at his ways as a public person: &#x201C;Here is Playhouse Manager, dependent on the <hi rend="italic">populace</hi> for everything; and there is no Bishop of Souls in England who dare appeal to the truth, and defy the Devil &#x26; his Angels, except <hi rend="italic">this</hi> very singular &#x201C;Bishop&#x201D; whose diocese is Drury-Lane!&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Theater district of London.</note> In fact I greatly esteem the man; and his domestic losses and distresses (loss of an excellent noble little wife; loss of Child after Child, so soon as they grew up; loss of &#x26;c &#x26;c) have filled me and others with sympathy for him in these years.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His wife, Catherine, five of their children, and his sister Letitia d. between <date when="1850">1850</date> and <date when="1858">1858</date>.</note> I add only that he is an <hi rend="italic">Irishman</hi> (that his wife was Irish,&#x2014;a pretty little being, whom I think he found an <hi rend="italic">Actress,</hi> and whom he left a high and real gentlewoman in her sphere):<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They had first met in Glasgow when she was nine and already acting; between their betrothal, <date when="1823">1823</date>, and their marriage, <date when="1824">1824</date>, Letitia Macready took her in hand; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390407-JWC-GW-01"><sic>11:70</sic><corr>JWC to GW, <date when="1839-04-07">7 April 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;so that you see the whole case is <hi rend="italic">Irish:</hi> and if Macready jun<hi rend="italic">r,</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Macready had wanted to become a professional actor, but, encouraged by his father, he joined the East India Co. as an officer; getting into debt, he was obliged to resign his commission.

He offered him a job in the Civil Service, but Edward decided to become an actor. He continued to get into debt and cause his family concern, apparently remaining in Australia for the rest of his life (Duffy, 205&#x2013;10).</note> whom I do not know, but whose Father&#x2019;s account of him I credit to the last particular, <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be launched on an honest career, and made useful among his fellow creatures, it will be, on every side, in the line of your vocation.&#x2014;&#x2014;This I think is about the substance of all I had to say; you will take it all for truth, my exactest notion of the truth: and there I must leave it with you.

<p>The &#x201C;Township of Carlyle&#x201D; (more power to it!) amused us very much, and there was in it a kind of interest, <hi rend="italic">pathetic</hi> and other, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was higher than amusement. &#x201C;Stuart Mill Street,&#x201D; &#x201C;Sterling Street&#x201D; (especially Jane Street):<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle Township, Murray District, Victoria; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580719-JWC-TC-01"><sic>34:54&#x2013;55</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-19">19 July 1858</date>]</corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580722-JWC-TC-01"><sic>67</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-22">22 July 1858</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> almost have wept a little (had any tears now remained me) at those strange handwritings on the wall: stern and sad, the meaning of them to me, as well as laughable.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>On reading your letter <hi rend="italic">again</hi> before sending off the <hi rend="italic">Adamson</hi> message I spoke of, other lights began to glimmer out on me from the bottom of the business, other care that perhaps was going to be needed from you:&#x2014;and I decided <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to send off that message to Adamson, but simply to bid him forward <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the &#xa3;1,000, and be ready if you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have anything to say to him.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Butler replied, <date when="1859-05-03">3 May</date>: &#x201C;The sober second and proper business thought of your letter of the 13th quite relieved me as I am sure you would have found the machinery proposed in your letter of 8th cumbrous &#x26; possibly expensive. The methods of remittance between the two countries are now so simple and the facilities of intercourse so constant and rapid that you may consider New York but at the other end of a steam ferry&#x201D; (Kimball 287); for TC&#x2019;s earlier proposal, see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590408-TC-CBU-01">TC to <sic>CB</sic><corr>CBU</corr>, <date when="1859-04-08">8 April</date></ref>.</note> He sent the money yesterday; yesterday I left it with my London Banker<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Smith, Payne &#x26; Smiths, Lombard St.</note> to <pb id="pg-35-76" n="35:76"/>pay thro&#x2019; the Union Bank<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Union Bank of London, Lombard St.</note> in the way you direct (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I made him copy); and today there is to come the &#x201C;Certificate&#x201D; or Receipt presentable by you to the &#x201C;Mess<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Duncan Sherman and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi> New York,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bankers, Wall St., New York.</note>&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I will inclose in this Note and instantly dispatch: I shall then have done with the matter. Please signify to me by some sign that the Money has come safe: I shall then feel no more concern ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it, but leave you to do wholly what your wisdom and kindness suggest in regard to the thing. You see well how totally inexperienced, and averse, I am in such finances: if you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> make Adamson do for me, well; but if <hi rend="italic">not,</hi> or not without too much trouble, then manage your own way,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I shall well believe to be the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> that was devisable for me in the matter.</p>
<p>I am in these months particularly held down, and indeed more laden than you can conceive with that intolerable load of Prussian rubbish (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has many times seemed as if it would really choke the life out of me before I got done with it): let this be my excuse for all short comings; if I do live to get honestly out of this sad whirling Abyss of Brandenburg dust and ashes, I promise to be an idler and a better boy for the remaining days appointed me.</p>
<p>When the Certificate arrives, I will mark the fact, before enclosing and sealing. <closer><salute>I remain, Dear Sir,</salute></closer></p>

<p>I have despatched the <hi rend="italic">Butler</hi> &#xa3;1,000,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590413-TC-CBU-01">TC to <sic>CB</sic><corr>CBU</corr>, <date when="1859-04-13">13 April</date></ref>.</note> in the way you recommended, or at least have it all sealed and ready for despatching; the &#x201C;trouble&#x201D; at last amounted to nothing, for the Bankers here did it all for me &#x26; sent the final <pb id="pg-35-77" n="35:77"/>Document by Post:&#x2014;yet you have no conception what a <hi rend="italic">hole</hi> in my own poor feckless peculiar operation such a slight business made. Alas the fabric of my efforts is of weak description at present; and needs only little to make a big hole in it!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">More</hi> power to me!</p>

<p>I cannot manage to find an <hi rend="italic">Adelung,</hi> however I <hi rend="italic">dun</hi> for it in Germ<hi rend="italic">y</hi> thro&#x2019; Neuberg and otherwise:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590228-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1859-02-28">28 Feb.</date></ref></note> I shall have to do with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that help too; I find many helps in that case for me:&#x2014;make <hi rend="italic">the utmost</hi> of what helps one has; there is no other refuge. I cannot describe to you how I <hi rend="italic">long</hi> to be delivered from this sad task; or how <hi rend="italic">small,</hi> amid the given conditions, my visible progress is! On the whole, however, I am in secret perhaps making progress: a mountain of dust ashes and cinders <hi rend="italic">has</hi> all to be smelted by heat and fuel of one&#x2019;s own (for in every item <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is chaotic incoherent); and the little bit of metal is a dreadful business to extract, in the circumstances I am in.</p>
<p>Poor Jane, I grieve to say, as the worst item of all, has broken down at last: in that outburst of almost july <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> last week but one, she <hi rend="italic">stripped</hi> too suddenly, gradually got into a bad cold (accumulated peccancies, I have perceived, were there at any rate); and for the last four days, sleepless, foodless, coughing, tormented somehow in the region of the <hi rend="italic">heart,</hi> she has been as ill as I ever saw her. Not till this morning pretty late, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I flatter myself with the least sign of improve<hi rend="italic">t;</hi> but now I do strive to believe we are round the corner again. She <hi rend="italic">has</hi> eaten a particle of white-fish (her one demand), and is lying quiet, with here and there a moment of sleep, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is better than none.&#x2014; I myself got a whiff of cold, on the same occasion; but it has not grown worse; a good ride yesterday (poor horse in galloping humour, over in Surrey) did it good.</p>
<p>I meant to ask you if Cressfield House <hi rend="italic">Furnished</hi> was still to let;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cressfield House in Ecclefechan, built by TC&#x2019;s father, for rent in <date when="1858-07-00">July 1858</date>; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580728-TC-JWC-01"><sic>34:77</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-28">28 July 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;or if there were any such attainable for summer coming.

<salute>Dear Miss Wynne,</salute>
<p>I am sorry to tell you, by order of my poor Wife, that she is quite too ill for writing;&#x2014;indeed confined close to bed these two or three days, and suffering a great deal, tho&#x2019; now better slightly than at one time. This is too true a<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> tale! The business was <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> (caught in that outburst of july heat the other week), of which I too got my share: but nothing at all to hers,&#x2014;indeed for two days (till yesterday morning) she was <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than I ever remember to have seen her.</p>
<p>There has an eloquent volume come to me this day, by a certain Peter Bayne:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Bayne (<date when="1830">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1896">96</date>; <ref target="volume-35/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1775"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), ed. of <hi rend="italic">The Witness</hi>, <date when="1856">1856</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862">62</date>, and misc. writer; in the preface to the 1st edn. of <hi rend="italic">The Christian Life, Social and Individual</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1855">1855</date>), Bayne had been very critical of TC&#x2019;s religious views. He had sent TC the book, and TC had &#x201C;answered in a kind manner,&#x201D; then forwarded Bayne&#x2019;s letter and the book to Jean Aitken; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550625-TC-JCA-01"><sic>29:339</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1855-06-25">25 June 1855</date></corr></ref>. Bayne had added a new preface to the 2d edn. (now being sent to Charlotte Williams Wynn), &#x201C;Genius and Influence of Carlyle.&#x201D; He proposed setting &#x201C;in clearer contrast than formerly what I regard as good and serviceable, and what I deem evil and pernicious&#x201D;; he then listed: &#x201C;first, certain qualities of his genius which render his rejection of Christianity to some extent accountable, but void of even a show of authority; next, what contributions may be safely accepted from him to intellectual, and even moral progress; and, thirdly, how potent the error of preferring, at the crisis of his moral and intellectual history, the vague sublimity of the pantheist to the divine simplicity of Christ, has been to injure and derange the action of his intellect&#x201D; (vii). He emphasized the importance of Carlyle&#x2019;s contributions to Christian teaching: &#x201C;Never sceptic saw so far into the meaning of Christianity as Mr Carlyle; never sceptic set so generously the Christian hero at the top of greatness. &#x2026; From such a man we need not turn away when he earnestly enforces truths of natural religion&#x201D; (xxviii).</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I judge will suit you much better than me. Pray accept it from me at any rate.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>
<p>We are in great misery here: my poor Wife, after escaping all winter, has fallen into the worst Cold I have ever seen her have; and suffers very much; <hi rend="italic">weak</hi> too as an infant,&#x2014;tho&#x2019;, I strive to flatter myself, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> growing worse, but contrariwise. I caught a Cold on the same occasion (late paroxysm of july-december weather),&#x2014;or rather <hi rend="italic">renewed</hi> a cold I have always obscurely had since a &#x201C;bathe in the Baltic&#x201D; last autumn:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >During TC&#x2019;s stay on the Isle of R&#xfc;gen with the von Usedoms, <date when="1858-08-00">Aug. 1858</date>; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580905-TC-JWC-01"><sic>34:170</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1858-09-05">5 Sept. 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note> but I try to keep it at the staff&#x2019;s end, and do not hitherto allow it to interfere with business. Absolute <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> being the rule here just now.&#x2014; I will come riding out to Denmark Hill,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >SE London, where Ruskin lived.</note> on Thursday (day after tomorrow): and call you over the coals<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To scold, or take to task for one&#x2019;s shortcomings.</note> for half an hour, if you will be at home. Near 5 p.m;&#x2014;no, let us say &#x201C;4.20 or so,&#x201D; and be away before 5 again. Don&#x2019;t write, <hi rend="italic">unless</hi> you have something to object.</p>
<p>That hovering about, and circling among the eddies, is not a pleasant process; but you will (to your astonishment perhaps) have various bouts of that kind in your wide voyage; and they are not unsalutary, still less can be dispensed with, tho&#x2019; so disagreeable to the natural man<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a response to Ruskin&#x2019;s undated letter to TC and JWC: &#x201C;When may I come &#x26; see you? / Friday&#x2014;Saturday.

Carlyle</name><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Woolner records a meeting with Ruskin at Cheyne Row, probably in May, before the Carlyles had decided on going to Scotland for the summer: &#x201C;I went and spent a long evening with Carlyle on Monday last: he was not in good spirits; in fact he has not been at all well since that laborious continental journey last year, the details of which he told me, and I do not wonder at his discomfiture. I tried hard to persuade him to cut work altogether for a few months, on the plea that it would be all the better for his book, and he confessed that he had not done so much in three months as he was accustomed to do in so many weeks when in a higher tone of health. &#x2026; Mrs. Carlyle absolutely needs country air, for she has been unwell for a long time, and I did not see her on that evening. &#x2026; Ruskin came in while I was there and commenced a buzz of inflated rapture upon a piece of charlatanry called &#x2018;Victory,&#x2019; by Marochetti, now being shown at Apsley House. &#x2026; Ruskin&#x2019;s inflation was met in a manner that I think one so utterly good and kind as you [Emily Tennyson] could not with your utmost efforts imagine; but we certainly gave that conceited creature something to reflect upon. When he was gone we both agreed that a man who took Marochetti as his ideal sculptor, Louis Napoleon as his favourite king and politician, and Spurgeon for his best beloved theologian, was certainly an unsafe guide for women and the youths of England; for besides these, his trusting admirers are few&#x201D; (Woolner 183).

<p><hi rend="italic">Don&#x2019;t</hi> make me those beneficent Flannel-shirts: I have at present not the least need of them, having already a stock for winter, and a d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> for summer, all quite fit for their function; besides you could not (without the linen or cotton <hi rend="italic">model,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> poor Jane has locked by) have any possibility of <hi rend="italic">fitting</hi> me with that uncertain material;&#x2014;and, alas, my poor Missus is far indeed from being able to help you in it just now!</p>
<p>She is close in her bed, with a Doctor watching over her,&#x2014;rather sensible kind of man, who comes daily, and gives little or no medicine, but prescribes food (or attempts at food), and above all things, absolute <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> and the steady endeavour to give a chance for <hi rend="italic">rest.</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Alfred Brooke Barnes.

<p>I myself have a good deal of cold; but I bathe, go riding &#x26;c: and, tho&#x2019; with more pain than usual, do not feel more feckless or overclouded.

Brown had been a great admirer of TC&#x02019;s writings for many years. TC&#x02019;s philosophy of work, as both social duty and source of personal fulfillment, as well as his criticisms of modern industrial society, capitalism, and utilitarianism, formed the intellectual basis of Brown&#x02019;s painting.</note> it is certain you could hardly have found among the Sons of Adam, at present, any individual who is less in a condition to help you forward with it, or take interest in it active or passive.

Carlyle.</note> has been frequently telling us; his last account, yesterday, is, that there does not seem to be yet any considerable improvement: but he seems to expect all things from the <hi rend="italic">weather</hi> coming round to its summer pitch;&#x2014;and indeed one cannot doubt but that would do us all a great deal of good, and be particularly beneficial to poor weak creatures who are suffering from too thin a skin in this world.&#x2014; It has been such a winter for sluggish heat, and such an <date when="1860-04-00">April</date> (&#x26; <date when="1860-05-00">May</date> hitherto) for venomous cold, as I hardly remember to have seen before. Today and yesterday the wind has fallen, &#x26; the sun come out; but all is still <hi rend="italic">easterly</hi> winterly; and I doubt we have not yet done with the affair; tho&#x2019; after a few more <hi rend="italic">clashes</hi> it surely must go.</p>

<p>In various German Books I read, that, in &#x201C;<date when="1741-04-00">April 1741</date>,&#x201D; he had a &#x201C;Camp,&#x201D; of Danes &#x26;c and Hanoverians, Camp at &#x201C;Hameln&#x201D; (a little south of Hanover Town),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hameln was about 10 mi. S of Hanover; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 15:202.</note> then vaguely at some other place (name forgotten) in the same Territory;&#x2014;and furthermore that he had (same <date when="1741-04-00">April 1741</date>) made &#x201C;a Camp&#x201D; somewhere on the &#x201C;Coast of Kent,&#x201D; and was reviewing and rendezvousing <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Forces there, with whom he intended to sail over, and <hi rend="italic">join</hi> his Dane-Hanoverian people. It is this last point, the &#x201C;Camp on the Coast of Kent&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The camp was not on the coast of Kent but was at Lexden Heath, nr. Colchester, Essex; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 15:201&#x2013;2.</note> April (or <hi rend="italic">so</hi>) <date when="1741">1741</date>, that I wish to be informed about. The other facts (Camp of Danes &#x26;c in Hanover Territory, at &#x201C;Hameln&#x201D; or elsewhere) are indubitable to me, and clear enough for my purpose: but for this of the <hi rend="italic">Kent</hi> Camp I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to have some precise <hi rend="italic">English</hi> evidence, and any notable feature of it (if notable any be) pointed out to me.</p>
<p>Will you, therefore, as the first thing after the Museum opens, look out a little in that direction,&#x2014;a <pb id="pg-35-93" n="35:93"/>little, not much, for in fact it is but a side matter to me,&#x2014;and ascertain date &#x26; place of this English camp: &#x201C;Coast of Kent&#x201D; is the vague name given;&#x2014;<date when="1741-04-00">&#x201C;April&#x201D; 1741</date><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The camp was at Lexden Heath, May&#x2013;<date when="1741-10-00">Oct. 1741</date>.</note> may not be the exact month either; but it will probably be near it. If you find anything about the simultaneous German Camp (&#x201C;Hameln&#x201D; or wherever it was, for I think it <hi rend="italic">shifted,</hi> and was often split into pieces, and perhaps reunited &#x26;c) I shall be willing to hear of it too. Not many <hi rend="italic">Extracts</hi> (none, unless you find them worthy); skeleton of the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> (<hi rend="italic">English</hi> fact, especially) is what I want.</p>
<p>You need not write in answer to this: merely send me what you succeed in gathering about this part of the business. This part <hi rend="italic">first.</hi>&#x2014;&#x2014; In great haste (as is too usual)</p>

But let me tell <hi rend="italic">him</hi> first, <hi rend="italic">why</hi> I sent for a D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on the present occasion&#x2014; In the first place my head was getting <hi rend="italic">light</hi> which threatened to disable me from giving directions about <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>&#x2014;in the second place, there was need of somebody <hi rend="italic">with authority</hi> who <hi rend="italic">knew,</hi> to explain to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C that if care were not taken, I should <hi rend="italic">die</hi> of sheer weakness! a thing which makes no show to inexperienced eyes&#x2014;especially to eyes blinded with incessant contemplation of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great!</hi>&#x2014; So I sent for the <hi rend="italic">nearest</hi> General Practioner<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS. Dr. Barnes lived at 182 King&#x2019;s Rd., Chelsea; he was listed as a surgeon.</note> (whom I knew <hi rend="italic">to bow to</hi>&#x2014;and had often been struck with the <hi rend="italic">human, practical</hi> look of)&#x2014;and he came and more than realized my most sanguine expectations&#x2014;not only making the danger of my situation <hi rend="italic">understood</hi>&#x2014;so that I was delivered from petty worries, and noises, and all that, but helping me <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with strength&#x2014;in medecines, and especially by giving me to understand that if I did not <hi rend="italic">make myself eat</hi> I would certainly die.&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">violent</hi> illness which had preceded this state of weakness, I had treated he said &#x201C;quite right&#x201D; but &#x201C;my <hi rend="italic">audacity</hi> was not a thing he would recommend me to repeat&#x201D;! During the three weeks that I saw him every day, and <hi rend="italic">was allowed to see no one else,</hi> I indeed took quite a <hi rend="italic">serious attachment</hi> to him! And as he finds me the <hi rend="italic">very oddest patient</hi> he ever had he now sits with me half-an-hour instead of the official <hi rend="italic">three minutes!</hi> Another thing&#x2014;he is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> unlike D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell&#x2014;certainly far liker him than any other medical man in London! But I am writing too long&#x2014; I am in the drawing room now (after three weeks confinement to bed)&#x2014;most part of the day at least&#x2014;and may see <hi rend="italic">one</hi> person daily&#x2014;and I am improving in strength slowly but steadily&#x2014; So soon as I am up to moving and the weather is warm I must go my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> says to the seaside&#x2014; God bless you</p>

<p>Thanks for your brief Notes; welcome tho&#x2019; brief. I hope you have got back to Scotsbrig safe the second time,&#x2014;&#x201C;for good&#x201D; now, as I suppose;&#x2014;and that were<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; for &#x201C;there.&#x201D;</note> will some favourable account of poor Isabella come tomorrow. We have had a dreadful May of it, all of us! Jane, from her bed, often talks to me of Isabella; and we &#x201C;wonder how she is&#x201D; &#x26;c; very sorry to think of the bad she has had, and still has.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Carlyle had been seriously ill for eight or nine weeks and d. <date when="1859-06-01">1 June</date>.</note> The shifting to upstairs was evidently a good movement; she cannot but be better for so much better a lodgement,&#x2014;in that venerable old room, so memorable, so strange to me when I but think of it!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the room in which TC&#x2019;s mother died in <date when="1853">1853</date>.</note>&#x2014;The <hi rend="italic">curtains</hi> of the bed I found misarranged; letting in the light upon one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">face:</hi> but of course that is easily mended, if found inconvenient.</p>
<p>Our Dr<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Alfred Brooke Barnes.</note> here, a sensible kind of man, does a great deal by &#x201C;improved diet,&#x201C;&#x2014;by continually enforcing and enjoining that, as the means of getting <hi rend="italic">strength,</hi> which is the thing wanted. I have no doubt you are wide awake to <pb id="pg-35-96" n="35:96"/>that too, and that Isabella&#x2019;s case is one greatly depending upon weakness too. There has come up here,&#x2014;not by our Doctor&#x2019;s invention, but greatly praised by him, and producing good effects,&#x2014;an <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> article, called &#x201C;Zambaio&#x201D; by some, by others &#x201C;Zambiano&#x201D;; which perhaps you know already: in case you do not, let me describe it to you, on chance. Two new eggs of the best quality (Scotsbrig not to be equalled in that respect); beat them well up, with a great deal of pounded sugar (quantity I cannot give, but the thing is extremely sweet); add then one glass of the very best madeira or sherry; stir in small saucepan; set on the fire and still diligently stir: in a minute or two it is a beautiful yellow batter;&#x2014;one of the nicest articles for taste; and nutritive, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think, beyond any other.&#x2014; That is my poor contribution of a recipe, if it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> happen to be of the least use or applicability! The fine weather, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is now at hand (deluges of straight-down rain are pouring overhead) will itself be half the battle, I hope. Good news will be very welcome here!</p>
<p>Poor John Welsh is gone, as doubtless you have heard: he had 4 days of actual confinement to bed (Friday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> to Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>); but his sufferings, from sore throat &#x26;c, were latterly heavier &#x26; heavier. His death is a sternly tragical thing in one&#x2019;s solitude here.&#x2014; Jane comes into the drawing room, thro&#x2019; the day; means to go out under the first sunshine with wind to <hi rend="italic">west.</hi> Weak very, and sleeps ill. <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jamie</salute>
<p>When I hear of poor Isabella being so dreadfully weak, I feel as if nothing but my own weakness were preventing me from flying off to Scotsbrig, to try and strengthen her up with the same means which has brought <hi rend="small-caps">me</hi> thus far in the way of recovery, from a state of weakness as extreme.</p>
<p>When I sent for a Doctor,&#x2014;(not so much in expectation that he could do me any good; as that he might make M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and Charlotte <hi rend="italic">understand how ill I was,</hi> so as to insure myself deliverance from noise &#x26;c) I was utterly spent&#x2014;feeling as I lay on my bed, as tho&#x2019; I were sinking-sinking in clouds of black smoke; bathed day and night in cold perspiration; and my heart fluttering at the slightest disturbance like a nest of young birds! I hated every sort of food offered me, and hardly touched it. For I did not believe that food taken against one&#x2019;s appetite could do one any good.</p>
<p>The first thing M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes did was to tell me plainly that if I did not insist on <hi rend="italic">making myself eat,</hi> I should die. and not a little eating would do&#x2014; I was to eat every two hours&#x2014;and only the most nourishing things. But what he showed his skill in, was in <hi rend="italic">suggesting</hi> a hundred palatable things and describing them temptingly&#x2014;so that at every visit he left me with a notion of at least <hi rend="italic">one</hi> thing of which I thought; &#x201C;well I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> find that possible to swallow!&#x201D; He gave me of course, at the same time, strengthening medicine&#x2014;as no doubt Isabellas Doctors<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William Bell (<date when="1791">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864">1864</date>) and William Young (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874">74</date>).</note> are giving her&#x2014; For about six weeks now, I have taken twice a day a mixture in which there is a great deal of steel in camphor julep<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julep is a liquid sweetened with sugar or syrup to which a variety of medications could be added. Camphor supposedly had a calming effect and was also used in the treatment of colds and chills.</note>&#x2014;with other things&#x2014;I have also had every day at least two glasses of wine.</p>
<p>Now if I were there what I would do would be to sit beside Isabella, and talk to her about <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> till she could not help <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi> about it, and describe to her the things <hi rend="italic">I</hi> first <hi rend="italic">took to.</hi> Some of them more handy to her than to me. for instance the fresh eggs and the cream&#x2014; I have been sending all the way to the Strand<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Robert Barham, dairyman, 272 Strand.</note> for little pots of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Devonshire cream</hi>&#x2019; at the rate of fifteen pence a pot! and a pot serves me only two days! <hi rend="italic">She</hi> could get so easily the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">half pint of good fresh cream</hi>&#x201C;(!) which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes ordered for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> as an accompaniment <pb id="pg-35-98" n="35:98"/>(merely) to my tea in the morning! or I might take a tumbler of new milk with a table spoonful of rum in it the first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>But what has done me most good of all is the thing Carlyle told you of (he says) made of Eggs and wine. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle writes that Isabella would not take <hi rend="italic">that</hi> on account of the sugar&#x2014; Well then, make it without sugar&#x2014;it would not be so palatable to most people but the strengthening part of it, the wine and egg would be there. Now do let dear little Jenny<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James and Isabella&#x2019;s da. Janet.</note> make this for her Mother and persuade her to try it.</p>
<p>Separate two <hi rend="italic">yolks</hi> of quite new eggs from the whites and drop them into a small saucepan&#x2014;then put to them a full glassful of wine and keep whipping up the egg yolks and wine over a slow fire, till it is all in a froth. Pour it in a teacup&#x2014;and take it up with it a bit of nicely toasted bread. Another way of doing egg that perhaps would suit best with the condition of <hi rend="italic">no sugar</hi> is to whip up a yolk in a tea cup, then mix a glass of wine with it and fill up the cup with boiling water, pouring slowly and stirring as D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle does with his tea. I have had quantities of calve&#x2019;s foot Jelly sent me&#x2014;but I don&#x2019;t find much strengthening in <hi rend="italic">it</hi> and I only take it during the night, when I lie awake&#x2014;as a sort of melancholy distraction! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes has no faith in jelly&#x2014;Thinks essence of beef much better&#x2014;</p>
<p>One thing that I have been much the better for Isabella could get famously from Annan and that is Salmon! People fancy it unwholesome&#x2014;but it was after my first dinner of Salmon that I felt the first assurance I should <hi rend="italic">live!</hi> and that I had my first <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> sleep. I have had it often since and it has always agreed with me. Such beautiful salmon trout you have at Annan! How I should like to try her with a bit!</p>
<p>I am still very weak and you would not think to look at me I had much to brag of&#x2014;but if you had seen what I was!&#x2014; Oh my dear Jamie I pray God you may soon be out of this anxiety  give her my kindest love  I would have written to herself but that I fear she could not be troubled with all this</p>

<p>We were sadly shocked and astonished yesterday; never till that phrase in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x201C;hope&#x201D; had we understood that there was any immediate apprehension of fail:&#x2014;merely the old business, we always thought, aggravated by the terrible weather &#x26;c &#x26;c!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There is a great deal of fire and talent in this little Book;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">England Subsists by Miracle</hi> (<date when="1859">1859</date>), written under Ward&#x2019;s pseudonym of Feltham Burghley, denounced the hypocrisy and corruption in English society in Carlylean tones: &#x201C;The terrific disclosures of immorality that daily come before the public; the legal facilities that are now offered for obtaining divorce, furnishing encouragement to adulterous alliances; the scandalous frauds that disgrace the trading community, and make commerce like a wild beast, with stains as frequent as the leopard&#x2019;s skin &#x2026; the religious hypocrisy that begets reputation; the false education that makes the poor knowing and insolent, instead of humble and industrious; on the other hand, the scepticism which boldly blasphemes the great All-Giver of its treasonous reason; the ill-disposed demagogue who shouts loud for reform, making sharp the wedge of revolution the while; the Papist carrying on covertly his insidious game &#x2026; the list of canting villainies would be painfully too long to recount, if even it could be recounted here&#x201D; (105&#x2013;6).</note> much manly insight and emphatic declaration, which the vulgar of mankind are still strangers to: I vote that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is considerably more like the road for an earnest Literary man than any of the former courses I have seen you on;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ward had sent TC a manuscript to assess in the summer of <date when="1854">1854</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540706-TC-CAW-01"><sic>29:123&#x2013;25</sic><corr>TC to CAW, <date when="1854-07-06">6 July 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note> and that you try <hi rend="italic">this</hi> farther, and with all the faculty and active and passive virtue you have, to see what it will yield, to you and to your neighbours of mankind!&#x2014;You manifest the elements of a very considerable gift for writing as a man should write in the England that now is; but give me leave to say they are in good part only <hi rend="italic">elemental</hi> as yet; and will require a long tough struggle, on your side, to bring them into the perfection they are worthy of. It is mainly a question of <hi rend="italic">morality,</hi> as you will find by and by. If you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> endure and endeavour, in a manful, modest and honest manner, victory does lie ahead, in my opinion!</p>
<p>You have recognized with noble indigna[tion] the brutal leprosy poor England has fallen into, and you do not, like the vulgar, reckon <hi rend="italic">it</hi> florid health and increase of weight: this is excellent to start with; but in going on, you will find you have not yet got near the bottom of that horrible phenomenon (unless I mistake it); and that there are strange questions to settle, and sad and strenuous things to do, very many, before you can with your right strength grapple it, and deal with it. Your contempt of the Penny Newspapers is transcendant,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ward condemned the popular press for its slavish allegiance to the principles of free trade and universal suffrage: &#x201C;The penny papers are wildly, insanely edited, and become the frantic exponents and exaggerators of the already flagrant follies of agitator Bright; who is nothing else but a rude, and ignorant democrat of considerable natural powers, but lawless, and uncultivated, and an infidel to the constitution of England. &#x2026; No penny paper&#x2014;we speak from personal knowledge&#x2014;no cheap provincial paper can sell now, if it be not warm in the advocacy of manhood suffrage and electoral districts. It is no matter how English it may be&#x2014;how thorough going in the exposure of abuses&#x2014;it must advocate the above trash, or it is doomed; and the editors soon find this out, and against their better judgment supply the requisite fustian to the fustian jackets&#x201D; (54&#x2013;55).

In case you <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be able to go (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have no right to expect either) I will ask you to take an approximation to a foot-rule with you (stick <hi rend="italic">notched</hi> to the length of a yard, for instance), and to tell approximately what the dimensions of the several rooms are,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">height,</hi> length, breadth,&#x2014;what kind of furniture, what &#x26;c &#x26;c; above all what kind of people. Whether they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take <hi rend="italic">Care</hi> of one&#x2019;s Horse; furnish unexceptionable farm-produce (butter, eggs, fowls, milk), and be reasonable to live with. I mean my Horse to fill his insatiable belly with <hi rend="italic">grass</hi> (nothing can equal his appetite for it just now), and I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give him 2 feeds of Corn per day,&#x2014;to keep <hi rend="italic">him</hi> in heart (better than he has been for years past, till quite lately) is a most essential matter to me. If in luck, I am to <hi rend="italic">start printing</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably of the 3d printing of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, vols. 1 and 2, which included further corrections; Chapman &#x26; Hall began to advertise it (as the 3d edn.) in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1859-11-12">12 Nov.</date> See also Tarr 173&#x2013;74.</note> on my return hither; and ought to be in a far other state of health than has been constant with me since I last left The Gill!&#x2014; Jane w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> need to negociate too about some Pony, Bath-Chair, Ass, or means of moving, as above-said; having almost no strength at all to walk. But that of course c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be difficult to settle in any such place.&#x2014; The delicacies of <hi rend="italic">sleeping,</hi> question of cocks &#x26;c &#x26;c, all these and other such points you are alive to, without hint needed. In short, exercise your judgement and your eyes; and <hi rend="italic">say what</hi> result they yield. I have been interrupted; &#x201C;dinner ready,&#x201D; then &#x201D; &#x2019;oss ready&#x201D;; and have missed the afternoon&#x2019;s post. It is now night 10 p. m.&#x2014; Jane, at dinner, read to me a new Letter of her Cousin Maggie&#x2019;s which gives a much more precise account of matters. So that, if it should be inconvenient to you, do not mind this Commission at all: most likely I shall have to come down myself, and take my luck of the thing, in case we <hi rend="italic">reject</hi> B<hi rend="italic">ne</hi> Mouth,&#x2014;as is likely enough: &#x201C;too hot,&#x201D; people tell us.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>In regard to what you write by Jamie this morning, I answer without delay, Yes. It is a duty, and will be a pious pleasure to me, to repair and set right in all ways the solemn <hi rend="italic">City of Refuge</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Num. 35:11.</note> where those forever dear to us now rest;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The graveyard at Ecclefechan; for the family gravestone, see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18591007-TC-AC-01"><sic>35:229</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1859-10-07">7 Oct.</date></corr></ref></note>&#x2014;and I can only bid you proceed in the business when and in what way you judge to be fittest. I forward Jamie&#x2019;s Note to the Doctor tonight, in case he should have anything to say about it: but that need occasion no dubiety, for I am ready to pay the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> expense myself, if none object to it;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC paid for renovations to the family plot, and John A. Carlyle paid for the refurbishment of the railings around the plot; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600523-TC-JC-01">TC to JC, <date when="1860-05-23">23 May 1860</date></ref>. Isabella&#x2019;s name was added to the gravestone of their son Thomas; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18591007-TC-AC-01"><sic>35:228</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1859-10-07">7 Oct.</date></corr></ref></note> and you have only to get the business done properly, and let me know when it is to be settled about between us. I hope you have already paid Latimer<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly John Lattimer (ca. <date when="1796">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866">1866</date>), mason, Forgebraehead, Canonbie, Dumfriesshire.</note> for that change in the <hi rend="italic">Lettering</hi>; and that you keep the sum marked against me, that I may not forget it when we meet. These things are a kind of solacement to one&#x2019;s sad heart to attend to; and I would not keep you waiting in regard to this.</p>
<p>I am sorry Jamie did not say anything about John&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James&#x2019;s son John.</note> <hi rend="italic">cold,</hi> caught in the way I heard of. Let him take great care in case of such accidents. I understood last summer<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was in Annandale from <date when="1858-06-24">24 June</date> to <date when="1858-08-20">20 Aug. 1858</date>.</note> he was reckoned rather liable in that direction; which is a dangerous one at his time of life, but <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be much guarded against by care taken, &#x26; I believe much diminishes in danger as one grows older. I hope he is now well again,&#x2014;and that in health you are all well. Poor little Jenny,&#x2014;poor all of you, all of <hi rend="italic">us</hi> I may say; for we have all had a loss that cannot be forgotten! But I must not speak of these things. Time softens all sorrows, tho&#x2019; at a certain age it cannot abolish them: let us walk steadfastly and humbly, and try to do our poor <hi rend="italic">wisest</hi> in the ever-altering Pilgrimage appointed us. We are going whither those before us have gone; only a short space separates us, altogether <hi rend="italic">short</hi> the longest it can be!</p>
<p>Perhaps I shall see you in Scotsbrig before long. There is a necessity or clear propriety for both of us to get into the Country for two or three summer months: a sad untowardly job to me; but, I think, an unavoidable this year. We <pb id="pg-36-271" n="36:271"/>are decidedly <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> towards Scotland,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC and JWC spent <date when="1859-07-00">July</date>, <date when="1859-08-00">Aug.</date>, and <date when="1859-09-00">Sept. 1859</date> in Scotland, at first together in Fife; TC then visited his family in Annandale while JWC went to visit her aunts in Edinburgh and then to stay with the Donaldson sisters in Haddington.</note> I perceive, if there w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> anything inviting turn up. I believe I shall have to go and look with my own eyes. <closer><salute>My blessing with you all, dear Brother. &#x2F;</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your prompt attention, and for the lucid account you have managed to send.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably information about accommodation during their proposed visit to Scotland, asked for in <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590607-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, [<date when="1859-06-07">7?

Aberdour: coastal town in Fife, across the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh.</note> will be the eligible thing. Most clearly a better <hi rend="italic">lodging</hi> (the other indeed questionably dingy and stuffy in this respect): the only things that give me pause, are 1<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript">o</hi> grass</hi> for my horse (I want him to go at unlimited grass, for health&#x2019;s sake, with 2 feeds of corn daily), and 2<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript">o</hi></hi> the &#x201C;unlimited command&#x201D; (or quasi-unlimited, one&#x2019;s fancy thinks) of Farm-sustenance, milk, eggs, chickens!

<p>So or not so, I cannot stand this wild jumble of dubieties any more; but will and do instruct you to end it for us, by <hi rend="italic">closing with the Paterson offer.</hi> on Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> next<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1859-06-15">15 June</date>.</note> (whether you go over in person again or not, whether you hear again from me or not), pray signify to Mrs Paterson that we <hi rend="italic">take</hi> her apart<hi rend="italic">ts: first</hi> of july (or it may be last days of june) to Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for certain; we &#x201C;intend&#x201D; (you can say) to stay 3 months, perhaps more if it suited; but do not, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> experimenting, make further engage<hi rend="italic">t: if,</hi> while our term runs, any ulterior lodger <hi rend="italic">applies,</hi> we shall feel bound to give Mrs P<hi rend="italic">n</hi> a definite Yes or No on her <hi rend="italic">then</hi> asking us.

    <salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
    <p>We are all in a tumble of packing here; carpets up, goods and chattels flying wildly about; everybody doing his best to get thro&#x02019; the most disagreeable of businesses. I have seldom had such a day as yesterday was to me: but, in fine, the thing was necessary; and I trust it may be <hi rend="italic">salutary</hi> more or less,&#x2014;nay already, in my own case, it almost seems as if the very agony of packing were a part of the medicine needed, and as if tho&#x02019; in desperately painful circumstances the cure had begun! The torpid stagnation and stupidity and dreary murk, in which I have sat for long months, useless and wretched,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Edward FitzGerald wrote, <date when="1859-06-20">20 June</date>, that he wanted to come and see JWC: &#x201c;I won&#x02019;t say <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, because I don&#x02019;t think in your heart you care to be disturbed; and I am glad to believe that, with all your Pains, you are better than any of us, I do think. You don&#x02019;t care what one thinks of your Books: you know I love so many: I don&#x02019;t care so much for Frederick so far as he&#x02019;s gone: I suppose you don&#x02019;t neither.&#x201d;</note> has evidently been tumbled into at least active chaos by these miserable operations.&#x2014; In fine we hope to be all on board the Princess Royal, Horse, maid &#x26; man,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Fritz, Charlotte Southam, and TC.</note>

<p>No vestige of Letter from <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> my poor little Jeannie, neither at Hanover Street<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s address in Edinburgh.</note> nor here;&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a very great disappoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me, and might be a root of <hi rend="italic">conjectures,</hi> which however I will not indulge in, knowing the Haddington punctuality &#x26;c &#x26;c. I followed you that wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> night;&#x2014;and sometimes I started broad awake, in my uneasy crib, at the thought of poor you spinning along thro&#x2019; the night. Poor wee soul!&#x2014;</p>
<p>As for us, we got along successfully altogether, in part beautifully, the weather for one day being altogether superb, and the next too was not to call bad. In short we arrived all safe &#x26; well this morning early at Granton; were joined by John, did our passage of the Frith,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., Firth of Forth.</note> our &#x26;c &#x26;c with the most perfect success; and fairly got to Humbie about half an hour ago; horse, dog, and two humans (with John for third) all alike delighted to get to port again. The place will do excellently; very neat, very cleanly, solitary; one of the finest-looking old deafish Mrs Thomsons<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Thomson, mother of James Thomson.</note> you ever saw; rooms clean and airy tho&#x2019; none of the largest;&#x2014;and such a view from the windows as could not be surpassed short of the Bay of Naples, if <hi rend="italic">there.</hi></p>
<p>In short come and see, Dear; so soon as you have rested yourself. And for <pb id="pg-35-120" n="35:120"/>God&#x2019;s sake don&#x2019;t forget to put <hi rend="italic">Fife</hi> after the Aberdour; and to write with punctuality! If I hear nothing tomorrow, what will become of me!</p>
<p>No danger of <hi rend="italic">buck</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gurgling water.</note> noises, I think; or none to speak of. <closer><salute>Adieu Dearest.</salute></closer></p>

<p>I got your Note about an hour and half ago, no sooner; judge how welcome a relief it was! Poor little soul, and all that lay in <hi rend="italic">you</hi> was faithfully accomplished. I can well believe you are among the most wearied of the children of Adam: it is a comfort to me to think you are where, of all places in the Earth, you have the best chance to be rested and soothed.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC was visiting Jean and Jess Donaldson in Haddington.</note> Do not <hi rend="italic">hurry</hi> as to Monday; <hi rend="italic">stay</hi> if you are gathering strength to the whole of as it will be thrift that you arrive at your strongest, for the new change; and we are anxious to have the adjustments completed ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> your coming. Charlotte and I are doing perfectly well; and we hope to give you a nice welcome, Monday or later. Appoint me the hour and place in Edin<hi rend="italic">r:</hi> it will be a pleasure and <hi rend="italic">profit</hi> to come and pick you up. Your Aunts being all in the mortar tub,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s aunts, Anne, Elizabeth, and Grace, were in the middle of alterations at Craigen Villa; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590627-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1859-06-27">27 June</date></ref>.</note> I know not where to appoint, if it be not John&#x2019;s Lodging (67. Hanover Street), whom I will apprise of such a possibility (he is here <hi rend="italic">again</hi> just now, and his Boy,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Arthur Watt.</note> poor good <hi rend="italic">flaffing</hi> soul);&#x2014;if you know a better place, name <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> and I will be there. As above said, <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi> is not of necessity at all; nay I had really rather not, if you feel <hi rend="italic">resting,</hi> and are in the <hi rend="italic">brashed</hi> state you could not but arrive in. Courage Dearest; we shall get thro&#x2019; these preliminaries, and then in this fine weather, with these fresh seas, breezes, fields and shady woods, we shall both of us get a great deal of good.</p>
<p>The place <hi rend="italic">fully</hi> maintains its first promise; excellent in all respects,&#x2014;except one, that of &#x201C;the master&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">sleep.</hi>&#x201D; I was in two beds last night; began in my own, but ended (much more happily) in yours. <hi rend="italic">Yours</hi> the front room, I am happy to say, is a capital place; pretty much the <hi rend="italic">Auchtertool</hi> bedrooms<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Auchtertool Manse, where JWC&#x2019;s cousins, Walter, Maggie, and Mary Welsh, lived.</note> in essentials, only still quieter; there I got four good hours and more to <hi rend="italic">close</hi> the night with, after a cock at 2 a.m had ended me in the rearward lodging!

<p>I was in <hi rend="italic">the sea</hi> before breakfast, and mean to try the like in future; finest of seas, of sunny mornings; Nero too had a small swim (as far as I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> throw him yesterday in the warm time; and is greatly better for it.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC later recalled: &#x201C;Poor Nero&#x2019;s last good days were with us at Aberdour in <date when="1859">1859</date>. Twice or thrice I flung him into the sea there, which he didn&#x2019;t at all like; and in consequence of which he even ceased to follow me at bathing time, the very strongest measure he could take&#x2014;or <hi rend="italic">pretend</hi> to take. For two or three mornings accordingly I had seen nothing of Nero; but the third or fourth morning, on striking out to swim a few yards, I heard gradually a kind of swashing behind me; looking back, it was Nero out on voluntary humble partnership&#x2014;ready to swim with me to Edinburgh or to the world&#x2019;s end if I liked!&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:91&#x2013;92).</note> Fresh fish to dinner; actual!

<p><salute>My dearest Mary.</salute> You are not to fancy me indifferent to your kindness, writing so often when ill yourself. Such sympathy is not thrown away on me; tho&#x2019; my long silence doesn&#x2019;t look like it. The fact is, I put off writing from day to day, that I might be able to tell you a conclusion was arrived at about our leaving home&#x2014;to tell you the <hi rend="italic">where</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">when</hi> of our going. And tho&#x2019; I have seen M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C in many crisises of doubting and vacillation I never saw him at such a pitch of it as on this last occasion!&#x2014; The thing written and done one day was rewritten and undone the next; till I began to despair of our ever making more progress than Lots wife!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 19:26.</note> At last in a blessed moment of desperation&#x2014;that lodging, which I think I told you of, in a farm house at Aberdour (Fife) was decided on&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> we must <hi rend="italic">carry out</hi> the decision&#x2014; I was in the midst of packing and preparing for the deficits of a lodging and for the possibilities of thieves at home when your last dear letter reached me&#x2014;and I tried sincerely to find a leisure half hour to write to you before starting&#x2014;but what with the dreadful quantity to be done and the next to no <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> to do it with&#x2014; I had to rest in the <hi rend="italic">intention.</hi> Last Wednesday morning I saw my husband, and maid, and horse, and dog, fairly off at eight in the morning to <hi rend="italic">sail</hi> to their destination. Myself set out at eight in the evening to travel all night!&#x2014;with a slight hope of reaching Sunny Bank next morning&#x2014;alive!</p>
<p>It was my Doctors<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Alfred Brooke Barnes.</note> opinion as well as my own, that <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> the whole journey at one fell rush, in the dark, would be less hurtful to me than attempting to sleep at Inns on the road and getting myself agitated by changes. I am sure it was, and that the best was made of a bad job that <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be made! I arrived here on Thursday<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1859-06-23">23 June</date>.</note> morning aching all over with fatigue, as I never <pb id="pg-35-126" n="35:126"/>ached before in all my life! but my mind quite calm&#x2014;and that is the chief thing I have to attend to&#x2014; Today is Sunday and I have done nothing since I arrived but <hi rend="italic">rest!&#x2014;</hi> My dear old ladies<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean and Jess Donaldson.</note> do every thing on earth that is <hi rend="italic">possible,</hi> to strengthen and sooth me&#x2014;and I am beginning to contemplate the remainder of the journey with some assurance of being able to accomplish it&#x2014;On Tuesday I proceed to Fife if all go well. My family are already safely established in the farm house and write to me satisfactory accounts of it.</p>
<p>You shall hear about it from myself ere long I had a letter from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle inviting us in a <hi rend="italic">self-devoted</hi> way to come and recruit at Lann Hall. Just as if I had not positively told her we were going to <hi rend="italic">some Seaside!</hi> No thank you, I don&#x2019;t want to be <hi rend="italic">used</hi> up for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringles purposes of vain glorious beneficence any further<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had enjoyed Janet Pringle&#x2019;s hospitality the previous summer; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580829-JWC-TC-01"><sic>34:164&#x2013;65</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-08-29">29 Aug. 1858</date>]</corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; If I can get a glimpse of You and the Doctor I will have it&#x2014; But for Lann Hall, it dont suit me.</p>

<p>Very well, Dearest; be it as you say for Tomorrow. I got both your Notes at once 2 hours ago; see you had not got my second one (wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> however, is little matter); and am right thankful you feel so rested, and ready for farther adventures.</p>
<p>Never mind your Aunts; it is better they stand apart with the Oriel window at present,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The alteration being done at Craigen Villa, the Welsh aunts&#x2019; home.</note> &#x26; do not confuse us.</p>
<p>So far as I can ascertain you have just one train that will suit from Haddington, and your &#x201C;after 1 o&#x2019;clock&#x201D; intention: the train wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> leaves Haddington at 10.13 a.m, and is due in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at 11.6. Leave all your luggage under charge of a Porter (price 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> each piece, I think) at the <hi rend="italic">spot where you arrive;</hi> it is the starting point for Burnt-Island; and a train will leave hitherward at 2.45 p.m (landing you at B<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Isl<hi rend="italic">d</hi> 3.45; you are but 3 miles then from Humbie, &#x26; I will be in waiting). Leave y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> luggage, I say; and take a Cab for John&#x2019;s (67. Hanover Street), who has clean rooms, &#x26; has given his landlady<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Margaret Orrocks (ca. <date when="1803">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860">60</date>).</note> warning; there <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> till towards 2.45;&#x2014;you need not bother <hi rend="italic">shopping;</hi> we can really get all the things otherwise: keep yourself quiet, and &#x201C;strong.&#x201D; may rain but be absent, ah me! No danger of east wind, but there is plenty of <hi rend="italic">west</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> however does not roughen the <hi rend="italic">sea</hi>); voyage last only 30 or 40 minutes: be well <hi rend="italic">wrapt;</hi> the Burnt Isl<hi rend="italic">d</hi> &#x201C;Cab&#x201D; seemed only to have a <hi rend="italic">hood:</hi> but we will <hi rend="italic">try</hi> for a close one, if need be; and your road, very hilly, is mostly sheltered with trees. Charlotte will have all in readiness for you here, and a clear fire burning.&#x2014;&#x2014; On the whole, it is probable you will find poor Jack himself <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi> for your train when you step out at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (he certainly will, if my Note of today find him in time and possibility);&#x2014;I will tell him to be very quiet, and to avoid <hi rend="italic">fussing:</hi> poor soul, do not be cross to him, sponge out nobly whatever is past; as for him he cannot keep <hi rend="italic">malice</hi> in his mind ten minutes ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> anybody, least of all ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> you. It is very likely he will insist on escorting to B<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Isl<hi rend="italic">d;</hi>&#x2014;but you can negative that (tho&#x2019; why sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> you?) if it is really disagreeable. And so fair wind you, poor little Child; and may I get you safe home here at the appointed hour! As it is uncertain whether you will <hi rend="italic">get</hi> this (blessings upon Rowland always)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rowland Hill, for the post.</note> I will write no more.</p>
<p>We do excellently, &#x26; I have had two fine rides, &#x26; a bathe daily before <pb id="pg-35-128" n="35:128"/>breakfast (takes 1 hour exact),&#x2014;and still more import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> sleeping-place these two nights.

Not a vestige of side-saddle, to hire by the week, to borrow, or to buy secondhand is discoverable in any of the shops here. Scarce even in Edin<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> they tell me.

<p>It strikes I will set James<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Jean&#x2019;s husband, James Aitken.</note> &#x26; you upon trying for me in Dumfries; <hi rend="italic">at</hi> Dumfries I make no doubt you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> succeed in a few days: we can have the thing <hi rend="italic">conveyed</hi> for a small expence to Aberdour; and probably this may be my real method even at this distance from me.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Jane got across safe on Tuesday; met by me at Burntisland towards 4; all right,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">none</hi> of the Letters had gone its appointed course any more than yours. We had barely got in here, when the rain, heartily for the second time, began its beneficent wetting. Jane has not been over the threshold at all since, tho&#x2019; the weather today and yesterday afternoon, is at its very finest. She is very feeble, indisposed to locomotion, <hi rend="italic">ancles</hi> so weak she can walk little; and I have not yet been able to rake up the least vestige of &#x201C;side-saddle,&#x201D; not to speak of farther vehiculatory apparatus. I rode to Kirkcaldy yesterday in quest; found Peter Swan<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Patrick (Peter) Don Swan (<date when="1808">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889">89</date>), whom TC had tutored; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18181106-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:143</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1818-11-06">6 Nov. 1818</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380826-TC-JWC-01"><sic>10:154</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1838-08-26">26 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>; he lived at St. Brycedale, Kirkcaldy.</note> prosperous and glad to see me, but in the saddler&#x2019;s shops or otherwise not even a hope of what I was wanting. I came off in haste, thinking I might possibly find you <hi rend="italic">here</hi> by the 4 o&#x2019;clock Boat. Miss Mary Welsh came after dinner; no farther company; so I lay down to repose in my new &#x201C;sitting room&#x201D; here. The Bed is quite off, and it is really a handy place, and useful to me in its new capacity. Bathe every morning before breakfast; good milk &#x26;c: all goes tolerably well,&#x2014;w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be near perfection if we had a side-saddle! Finding nothing in Kirkcaldy, I wrote to Jean (a second time) to try Dumfries for us. If in any Saddler&#x2019;s you notice a secondhand article at all like the money, do not fail to make note of it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If you do not come today, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I can hardly hope, I think of crossing to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> <pb id="pg-35-130" n="35:130"/>tomorrow. <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> uncertain; most likely by the Aberdour Noon Boat: I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> see poor Jamie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle, TC&#x2019;s nephew from Scotsbrig, who was visiting John A.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your prompt and effectual help. If the side-saddle come from Scotsbrig, we shall be free of the <hi rend="italic">worst,</hi> and able to make a fair shift: if a Cuddie too can be had, we shall be quite made up!</p>
<p>We will give up the Gig speculation altogether, as little suitable were it even easier: but pray let James<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably her husband, James Aitken.</note> set about the Cuddy enprise<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> without loss of a moment! Two sovereigns or guineas is a cheap price (don&#x2019;t fear the price),&#x2014;then I suppose the quadruped will travel under the character of <hi rend="italic">stirk,</hi> and cost but little to Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi>&#x2014;after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> we have hold of him, and the problem is completely managed. Jane, in her tremulous nervous state, has never been willing for anything but a Cuddy: on my horse I could manage perhaps by <pb id="pg-35-131" n="35:131"/><hi rend="italic">leading;</hi> but as to gig exercise, she has never given the least encourag<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> under my guidance; indeed the roads are so steep, gnarly with little stones &#x26; even big, and generally so <hi rend="italic">bad,</hi> and so <hi rend="italic">alarming</hi> to my Cockney Quadruped, we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> evidently not do good with the Gig. Direct all your strength to the Cuddy, and let us have <hi rend="italic">him</hi> as soon as possible, like helpers in need!&#x2014;&#x2014; I was just ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> setting off for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in quest of saddle apparatus, but had not <hi rend="italic">gone</hi> anywhither since writing: I will now put off Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> till tomorrow,&#x2014;when Jamie jun<hi rend="italic">r</hi> of Scotsbrig, it seems, is to be visible along with the Dr.</p>
<p>We are certainly well lodged here; &#x26; I for my share believe myself to be doing well. But poor Jane seems very much brashed (partly by <hi rend="italic">emotion</hi> at Haddington too, I fancy); &#x26; I have never yet got her persuaded over the threshold hardly, tho&#x2019; there is the very finest weather, and most excellent inviting old Wood<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Humbie Wood; for its position, see frontispiece [viewable in the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi> on the table of contents page for vol. 35].</note> (full of paths and strange old trees) beginning within few yards of us. She sleeps better than I have sometimes known her do; eats d<hi rend="italic">o:</hi> if I had her fairly afloat on the Cuddy, I calculate all will go far better!&#x2014; I am not <hi rend="italic">working</hi> at all; reading a little and but a little in my stupid Pruss<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Books.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin</salute>
<p>It would be a disgrace to human nature that I should not have written to you before this; were it not that poor human nature is sometimes not responsible. I don&#x2019;t hold myself responsible for anything I have done or not done since I took leave of you at King&#x2019;s Cross!&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her doctor.</note> told me that &#x201C;weakness of mind was the natural and inevitable accompaniment of weakness of Body; that no woman, as weak as I was, could make her mind bear up&#x2014;any more than she could make her legs bear her up!&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">He</hi> ought to know! at all <pb id="pg-35-132" n="35:132"/>events, I find consolation&#x2014;a melancholy consolation in believing him! And the fact that I have been arrived at my destination a whole week<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had traveled from Haddington to Humbie, via Edinburgh, Tues. <date when="1859-06-28">28 June</date>.</note> without a word out of my head to you, has no reproach for my conscience in it&#x2014;I simply accept it as <hi rend="italic">a part of my illness.</hi></p>
<p>For the rest; &#x201C;the view&#x201D; is all that could be wished! I never saw so beautiful a view even in a dream! And the &#x201C;Farm House&#x201D; is all that could be asked of a Farm House and more! We have got <hi rend="italic">two</hi> sitting-rooms after all&#x2014; A great mercy that!&#x2014;and the whole appartment is of good size, well aired, well furnished and very clean&#x2014;no &#x201C;small Beings&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> in it! (Mazzini&#x2019;s name for Bugs and Fleas)&#x2014;</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C bathes every morning and rejoices much over the &#x201C;soft food&#x201D; for both himself and his horse.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for paying the Saddle and intercepting it; the damage in pence sterling is not considerable, and I will make it good soon in stamps or otherwise.</p>
<p>With a mighty effort, I yesterday at last got poor Jane mounted on my horse (for you have no idea how weak &#x26; timorous she is); I led her successfully <pb id="pg-35-133" n="35:133"/>however; and we made, thro&#x2019; the shady wood, then by the village, shore &#x26;c,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NE through Humbie Wood, then SE toward Newbigging village, W along the shore toward Aberdour, before turning N to Humbie Farm; for map, see frontispiece [viewable in the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi> on the table of contents page for vol. 35].</note> a good ride which quite reassured her as to the Horse&#x2019;s quality, &#x26; did her perceptible benefit. We were to have gone triumphantly today into &#x201C;the Park&#x201C;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Donibristle Park; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590630-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1859-06-30">30 June</date></ref>.</note> but alas, the lout of a man<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> left the saddle within reach of my Horse&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">mouth</hi> (flung carelessly aside, I believe, into the manger), and the Horse tore away the leather from both the horns, and <hi rend="italic">before</hi> riding farther, the saddle has to be mended again! I have seldom seen such an act of blockheadism. Saddle is today, we find, <hi rend="italic">gone to Kirkcaldy</hi> to be repaired;&#x2014;&#x201C;will for certain be home this night,&#x201D; but one knows not what to trust to among such a set of human individuals and circumstances.&#x2014; I do hope the Dumfries Cuddy will somehow contrive to reach us; perhaps tomorrow? It seems to me of the last importance that poor Jane should have riding; she is nearly quite incapable of walking, or locomotion otherwise in this place.&#x2014; &#x2014; I achieved nothing else yesterday, but a tumble on the slippery wet rocks, in getting in to bathe; fell fairly backwards, and gave my head a knock, but except laming one of my elbows <hi rend="italic">in the skin</hi> got no other damage. If the Cuddy were here, and the saddle back, we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> still do well, the air, diet, sea &#x26;c are so beneficial.</p>
<p>I cannot think of coming tomorrow to Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> it <hi rend="italic">puddles</hi> the whole mind of me, and is unpalatable to human indolence and diligence alike! Pray call at the Shoemakers<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Duncan &#x26; Co., 57 Princes St., Edinburgh.</note> as you pass, and bid him <hi rend="italic">send</hi> the shoes as at first intended. It is probable you may hear nothing more about the Cuddy&#x2019;s advent than what is in the inclosed Note of Jean&#x2019;s: if there be any help to render at Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> of course I will apply to you.&#x2014;&#x2014; The only <hi rend="italic">nice</hi> way of seeing us here, and having some talk together w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> came across by Leith at 7 a. m., found us at breakfast here, dined, spent the day &#x26;c, and returned at 7,&#x2014;on Saturday next? This is the real plan. <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p>Having seen you take down my address, dear Geraldine, the idea had somehow insinuated itself into my mind, that I was not to <hi rend="italic">write,</hi> in the first <pb id="pg-35-134" n="35:134"/>instance, but <hi rend="italic">to be written to!</hi>&#x2014; I grant it to have been an unreasonable idea enough, but reasonableness was never my forte!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Had I been ever so alive howe[ver] from the outset, to what reason and &#x201C;duty&#x201D; required; I <hi rend="italic">couldn[t]</hi> have written much sooner under the circumstances. &#x201C;When one&#x2019;s body is fallen into extreme weakness; it would be as absurd to reproach oneself for one&#x2019;s mind giving way as for one&#x2019;s legs giving way.&#x201D; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes told me <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> and I have found a melancholy consolation in it!</p>
<p>All that bustle and bother before setting out&#x2014;the frightful fatigue of the journey to Haddington&#x2014;the trouble of soul that always overtakes me there&#x2014;and then the new fatigues of the journey here, and the oppressive strangeness of our <hi rend="italic">hired</hi> lodging&#x2014;all <hi rend="italic">that</hi> seemed to use up the little vitality left in me; and I have spent my first week here in a state of complete prostration. But yesterday M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C having realized a side saddle, had it put on&#x2014;his own horse!! and <hi rend="italic">compelled</hi> me to mount him, tho&#x2019; in deadly terror&#x2014;the horse being not only what it had always been; very high, and very spirited; but (M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had informed me) &#x201C;in a state of <hi rend="italic">perfect ecstasy</hi> over the <hi rend="italic">soft food</hi> afforded him here! tho&#x2019; unable to recover from its astonishment at the badness of the Fife roads.&#x201D; My terror then in being set on his back, and <hi rend="italic">led</hi> off by <hi rend="italic">M</hi>r <hi rend="italic">C</hi> was not unnatural in my present condition of nerves&#x2014;but I was the better for getting into the open air, the first time since I arrived&#x2014;even on this terrific principle!&#x2014;and to do myself justice, I came <hi rend="italic">back without being led!</hi> In a day or two please God I shall be in possession of a&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cuddy</hi>&#x201D; (donkey) &#x201C;all to myself&#x201C;&#x2014;on which I may get about in a more placid state of mind. As for <hi rend="italic">walking!</hi> I cannot so much as get up and down stairs without holding on to the bannisters!! And so I have only been <hi rend="italic">once</hi> down since I came here&#x2014;when I went on the horse yesterday! Our rooms are all on one floor happily. Such nice rooms! well sized well furnished&#x2014;and so <hi rend="italic">clean!</hi> And by a little invention we have managed to have <hi rend="italic">two</hi> sitting rooms as well as two bedrooms. As for the <hi rend="italic">view</hi> it is beautiful beyond all description! Charlotte is the happiest of girls, no end of &#x201C;young men&#x201D; making up to her  Nero the happiest of dogs, curing his mange by sea bathing&#x2014;and the Horse as I have said in &#x201C;perfect ecstasy&#x201D;! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and myself are the least benefited! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C bathes every morning and overdoes the milk diet&#x2014;and I think the <hi rend="italic">betterness</hi> he professes to feel is nothing but biliousness&#x2014; As for me I am past mending&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jean</salute>
<p>We were overjoyed to hear of the Cuddy; which promised to be a friend in need, and ready singularly soon. News of him came on Monday: but we have been much surprised since, and for the last 24 hours lost in wonder and conjecture, at the non-appearance either of him or of the least account of him! At length tonight by the evening mail comes a Note dated yesterday at the Caledonian Railway Office, Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The office and station of the Caledonian Railway were at the N end of Lothian Rd., Edinburgh.</note> informing us that &#x201C;1 Donkey&#x201D; (so they are pleased to style it) &#x201C;carriage paid to Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi>&#x201D; did arrive, they don&#x2019;t say when; that he, with expense &#x201C;2/8&#x201D; or something like that, was sent to Granton Pier, also to Leith Pier, and that the Fife Steamers at both places refused to have him, &#x201C;unless <hi rend="italic">somebody</hi> took him in charge&#x201D;!&#x2014; By a small exertion I will get somebody to go across for the animal tomorrow; and then the thing <hi rend="italic">will</hi> at last be done,&#x2014;and poor Jane will have something to ride upon at last. You cannot conceive in the least what a business that has been, and how futile hitherto. Unexceptionable side-saddle is here since Saturday; on Monday, after much rhetoric, I got her persuaded to mount my horse, I <hi rend="italic">leading</hi> at a walk,&#x2014;the horse one of the quietest in the world. One hour&#x2019;s riding was accomplished that Monday not unsuccessfully. Same day the lout of a fellow here laid down the Saddle within reach of the Horse&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">mouth,</hi> who thereupon proceeded to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> part of it: despatch to Kirkcaldy (the nearest saddler&#x2019;s) was necessary thereupon, &#x26; <hi rend="italic">no</hi>-saddle for a day following. Yesterday we tried again; but yesterday poor Jane&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">terror</hi> (for no <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> at all) was such that we had to cease abruptly, &#x26; I believe the &#x201C;ride&#x201D; did her real mischief. If this Cuddy, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she much longs for, do carry her comfortably, it will be a real blessing after all; and I shall be honourably quit of one of the most provokingly troublesome small functions I have had on hand for long years past! You shall hear again of me in about 2 days, I hope. <closer><salute>Yours ever, with thanks many</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The Cuddy, whose absence and total silence &#x26; non-appearance has been a source of painful tho&#x2019; contemptible wonder for a day or two past, turns up to night as <hi rend="italic">standing</hi> &#x201C;carriage paid to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201D; at the Caledonian Railway Station,&#x2014;being <hi rend="italic">refused</hi> (because &#x201C;unattended&#x201D;) first at Granton, then at Leith, and so bro<hi rend="italic">t back</hi> (I <hi rend="italic">guess</hi> to Lothian Street)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lothian Rd., where the Caledonian Railway office and station were.</note> with his expenses charged upon him, and notice (after 30 hours) that I had better send for him immediately.</p>
<p>Immediately sent for I do intend that he shall be, if any of those peasants can be bribed to go across for him by tomorrow morning&#x2019;s Aberdour Boat. To have once <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with this tremendous operation, of realising something that my poor wife <hi rend="italic">can</hi> ride upon, will be a blessing I shall have reason to be grateful for indeed! If none of these stupid peasants can be bribed to go, I design to go myself; and in the name of the immortal gods, supernal and also infernal, to wind up that operation, &#x26; wash my hands of it.</p>
<p>Poor Jane has much need of this Cuddy or of something to carry her. She cannot walk almost at all; <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> not (tho&#x2019; there is nothing whatever of danger or appearance of danger) use the Horse for riding: we tried again yesterday; and her terror, and her <hi rend="italic">effort</hi> to subdue it, and to <hi rend="italic">sit</hi> tho&#x2019; in agony made her quite ill thro&#x2019; the night,&#x2014;and, except longings for the Cuddy, there was nothing said of riding today.&#x2014; I am busy reading up the Seven-Years War and <hi rend="italic">Fried</hi>h <hi rend="italic">der Andere;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590610-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1859-06-10">10 June</date></ref>.</note> you can judge with what accompanying furtherances.

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>I was very glad of your letter&#x2014;not only because it was a letter from you, but a sign that you had forgiven me&#x2014;or still better,&#x2014;that you had never been offended!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I assure you, an hour or two later, when left alone and quiet in the railway carriage, I wondered as much as you could do what Demon inspired the tasteless jest with which I bade you goodby! in presence too of the most gossipping and romancing<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC has written in blue pencil above &#x201C;romancing&#x201C;: &#x201C;Geraldine,&#x2014;ask?&#x201D;</note> of all our mutual acquaintance!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine Jewsbury.</note> I was so tired that day! Oh my Heavens! <hi rend="italic">so</hi> tired!&#x2014; And fatigue, which makes a healthy human being sleepy, makes <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> in my present nervous state <hi rend="italic">delirious.</hi> That is my excuse&#x2014;the only one I have to make at least&#x2014;for the foolish words I took leave of you with.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Hawkes<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emilie Hawkes.</note> will have told you that I arrived safe, and that I am quite content with the &#x201C;Farm House.&#x201D; It commands the beautifulest view in the world, and abbundance of what M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C calls &#x201C;soft food&#x201D; (new milk fresh eggs, <hi rend="italic">whey</hi> &#x26;c)&#x2014; The people are obliging, and the Lodging very clean. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C bathes in the sea every morning, lyrically recognises the &#x201C;pure air,&#x201D; and the &#x201C;soft food&#x201D;;&#x2014;and if not essentially in better health, is in what is almost as good,&#x2014;that make-the-best-of-everything state which men <hi rend="italic">get</hi> into when carrying out their own idea&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">only then!</hi></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I am bound to put an end to your anxieties about the Cuddy Adventure; if I carry this to the Post-Office tonight, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> can be done by my last <hi rend="italic">outrake</hi> now at hand, I believe you will get it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Know then that the Cuddy thus far seems to be a perfect success; and does promise, so far as 2 separate performances will indicate, to be a very great achievement in this household. Something like a <hi rend="italic">pair of legs</hi> to the poor Missus; for really there seemed no outlook of locomotion for her otherwise!</p>
<p>The Boy went across on Friday; and returned successfully with the Long-eared Creature ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 5 p.m. The &#x201C;charge&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cha-arge</hi>&#x201D;; coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520805-JWC-TC-01"><sic>27:206&#x2013;7</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1852-08-05">5</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-08-06">6 Aug. 1852</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> at the Railway Station for <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> had been astonishingly moderate, about 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi> a-day seemingly,&#x2014;&#x201C;keep&#x201D; of <hi rend="italic">grass,</hi> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> surmise:&#x2014;the entire expenses beyond what you laid out did not quite amount to 10/; wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> for &#x201C;a pair of legs&#x201D; (if the Creature sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> prove such), could not be counted considerable. His appearance was approved of; respectable, tho&#x2019; lean; the Boy had given him <hi rend="italic">two</hi> feeds of corn in the course of the day; mown rye grass &#x26; clover was furnished for subsequent board (with a lock of corn <hi rend="italic">once</hi> a day,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he refuses to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> this day, being perhaps <hi rend="italic">staw&#x2019;d</hi> for the time): and so, Saturday, the day after his arrival, the first experiment was made, and today the second; Jane riding triumphantly, and the poor Beast doing his part in the most unexceptionable manner. He seems weakish and timid, she says, but willing, obedient; goes at a fair Cuddy pace; and she has not the least fear while on his back. Thanks, therefore, many kind thanks for the trouble you have all taken; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has been so essentially useful to us. I see not how we c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have done otherwise at all: no such thing as a cuddy appears to exist in these parts; many &#x201C;bather Leddies,&#x201D; on Saturday, came eagerly about, asking Jane &#x201C;If that was a <hi rend="italic">hired</hi> Donkey?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh no Ma&#x2019;am, it is my own!&#x201D; answered the Envy of surrounding Females with weak limbs.&#x2014;&#x2014;Tell us now the exact cipher, <hi rend="italic">every</hi> item included, of what the cost was; that we may at least repay that part of the debt.</p>
<p>Jack was here on Saturday; <hi rend="italic">met</hi> us just as we were embarking on the first trial; and staid pleasantly till the last Boat. I bathe every morn<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> weather beautiful;&#x2014;no <hi rend="italic">work</hi> capable of being done: indeed this of &#x201C;the side-saddle&#x201D; has been work hitherto! Well otherwise; well for <hi rend="italic">us.</hi> <closer><salute>Blessings on you all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>We are greatly shocked and surprised to hear of the bad turn of health you have had; and proportionally thankful to Heaven, and the other Helps,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC used a plural form of the noun &#x201C;help&#x201D; to mean a kind of material aid (cf. <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380110-TC-AC-01"><sic>10:4</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1838-01-10">10 Jan. 1838</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491103-TC-JAC-01"><sic>24:276</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1849-11-03">3 Nov. 1849</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491214-TC-JAC-01"><sic>311</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1849-12-14">14 Dec. 1849</date></corr></ref>). Here he presumably means Forster&#x2019;s doctor, Dr. John Elliotson (<date when="1791">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868">1868</date>; <ref target="volume-35/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8671"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), physician and mesmerist, and whatever he prescribed. Forster replied, <date when="1859-07-15">15 July</date>: &#x201C;It was a sharp illness, such as I never before had&#x2014;spasms in stomach with touch of inflammation, happily got into subjection by the good Elliotson before it became dangerous. But it has left me &#x2026; very susceptible to fatigue on the least exertion.&#x201D;</note> that it is over again! I had intended, every day, for about a week before leaving Town, to call at Montague Square,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster lived at 46 Montague Sq.</note>&#x2014;and there is a mad feeling in me (always till I reflect again) as if that omission had been the guilty cause of what followed! For the human conscience is sensitive, on some points, beyond what you perhaps suppose.</p>
<p>It seems to me, dear Forster, you ought to be out of London altogether, in this hot season, while the Country is in all its glory and the Town in all its noise and smoulder. Nay why not fling up your Office<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster was sec. to the Lunacy Commission. Forster replied that he had already taken a house in the country at Anerley for three months; he was traveling to work &#x201C;by the Croydon Railway&#x2014;for business compels me to be here daily.&#x201D; Anerley was 3 mi. NNE of Croydon, approx. 10 mi. S of London.</note> altogether, if it tie you in any measure in respect of what is so all-important as the concern of Health. To you no office is of the least practical moment; yields neither distinction, nor real profit of any kind,&#x2014;nor does your pleasure lie, I think, in that direction, tho&#x2019; probably some vague notion of &#x201C;duty&#x201D; may, as habit no doubt does. I pray you reflect seriously on this! To me the Country with its mere silence, <hi rend="italic">purity</hi> &#x26;c, is always about some 30 or 50 <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi> on the right side of the balance as to health: I am seriously minded, if I ever live to get done with this undoable Book, to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> actually off, and quit the horrors of Babel and <hi rend="italic">its</hi> ugly Nebuchadnezzars<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See 2 Kings 24, 25.</note> for a place of God Almighty&#x2019;s making! Besides one might have two places, and alternate,&#x2014;change sides, like a fish getting fried, for the remainder of one&#x2019;s time.</p>
<p>It is very clear to me if I had you <hi rend="italic">here</hi> just now, to ride two hours aday with me among the silent Hills and Vallies, by the shore of the beautifullest Sea in the world;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster replied: &#x201C;I rejoice to think of you, dear Carlyle, riding daily thro&#x2019; these glorious scenes, much meditating.&#x201D;</note> bathing daily, living on country messes from the neathanded <pb id="pg-35-142" n="35:142"/>Phyllis;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rustic servant or maid; cf. Virgil, <hi rend="italic">Eclogues</hi> iii and v.</note> and forgetting Bel &#x26; the Dragon,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Babylonian idols; see Apocrypha, book of Daniel 14.</note> as if they were <hi rend="italic">already</hi> in the Home full surely destined to them for all Eternity,&#x2014;it seems to me you would feel yourself gathering strength again before a week were past. Tell Mrs Forster of all this; and that my Wife has got a Cuddy (<hi rend="italic">anglice</hi> [in English] Donkey), and begins to be happy. And that there are still Lodgings here; entire &#x201C;Houses to Let&#x201D; (all but a corner into wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the shivering natives squat); and that there are other Cuddies,&#x2014;and that there is such a view, by sea and land, as was never seen before!&#x2014; &#x2014; On the whole, practically, write a word to us, dear Forster, and say exactly <hi rend="italic">how you are,</hi> to ears interested.</p>

<salute>My dear Mrs. Gilchrist&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I don&#x2019;t remember whether I engaged to write to you or not; but anyhow the spirit moves me to write&#x2014;and exactly at the wrong moment! when I have the softest pen and the thickest ink that has fallen in my way since I left home!</p>
<p>I suppose you are long removed to your country quarters<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her mother&#x2019;s house at Earls Colne, Essex (Gilchrist 71).</note> and have derived, I hope, more benifit from &#x201C;the change&#x201D; than I have done as yet. I suppose the dreadfully fatiguing journey knocked me up to such an extent, that it has taken all this time of &#x201C;pure air,&#x201D; &#x201C;quiet&#x201D; and &#x201C;new milk and rum&#x201D; to overcome the bad consequences&#x2014; Certainly, between ourselves, I am not sensible of having gained an atom of strength, either bodily or mental, since I left Chelsea!</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have lost the curb-<hi rend="italic">chain</hi> of my bridle (always losing something!)&#x2014;I think it must have gone in the swift riding in the Park<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Donibristle Park; see 157.</note> the day <hi rend="italic">before</hi> you were here; had I remembered to write to you last night, I might have looked for a new one (3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> carriage) tomorrow morning. As it is, I believe you are my promptest chance.&#x2014; Pray go to our old saddler,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Gray &#x26; Son, saddlers, 13 S. St. David St., Edinburgh.</note> and state the case. As my bridle is <hi rend="italic">old,</hi> quite near its <hi rend="italic">end;</hi> you may<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; TC probably omitted &#x201C;buy.&#x201D;</note> the <hi rend="italic">most</hi> secondhand chain he has; otherwise a new one, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I think costs only a shilling. You can <hi rend="italic">look</hi> also at his Bridles, and ask the price:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John replied, <date when="1859-07-13">13 July</date>: &#x201C;I sent off the curb (price 6 pence), along with the &#x2018;Norse Tales&#x2019; for Jane or yourself. &#x2026; A good bridle at Messrs Gray&#x2019;s costs 27 Shillings. Inferior sorts can be had from 16 shillings upwards. &#x2026; The curb chain I sent was &#x2018;second hand.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> I need not take this one back with me.</p>
<p>Jane was <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> on her Cuddy yesterday; successful riding,&#x2014;but, alas, there had been too much of it; for she had no sleep at all thro&#x2019; the night, and the riding, as I judge, had been to blame for it. She is quite low today (no wonder), and is not intending to stir off the sofa at all. The Misses Welsh<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maggie and Mary Welsh.</note> were here; but I sat close in &#x201C;the study&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had converted one of the bedrooms into a study; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590625-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1859-06-25">25 June</date></ref>.</note> (<hi rend="italic">lucus a non</hi>),<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Lucus a non lucendo&#x201C;: a play on words, defining something by what it is not: the grove (<hi rend="italic">lucus</hi>), named from its <hi rend="italic">not</hi> shining (<hi rend="italic">non lucendo</hi>), so studying is the one thing TC did not do in the study during the Welsh cousins&#x2019; visit.<hi rend="italic"></hi></note> and saw nobody.&#x2014; It seems to me we are about to have a great quantity of rain;&#x2014;I, for my share, must try to lay in some riding, at any rate.</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>You may form some small idea of my weak confusion of mind from the fact that I cannot for my life tell whether I have already written to you from this place or not! It is best to err on the safe side however&#x2014;and make assurance doubly sure that you have my address.</p>
<p>There it is above!&#x2014;written very distinctly I flatter myself&#x2014;as addresses ought always to be! For the rest; our lodging here is all and more than could be expected of sea side quarters. The beautifulest <hi rend="italic">view</hi> in the created world!&#x2014;Rooms enough, wellsized well furnished, and quite clean. Command of what M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C calls &#x201C;soft food&#x201D; for both himself and horse&#x2014;(as for <hi rend="italic">me soft food</hi> is the last sort that I find useful&#x2014;) And as for air; there <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be none purer than this, blowing from the Atlantic,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The wind blew from the west for a week; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590719-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1859-07-19">19 July</date></ref>.</note> fresh on a hill top! Decidedly there is everything here needed for happiness but just <hi rend="italic">one</hi> thing&#x2014;the faculty of <hi rend="italic">being</hi> happy! And <hi rend="italic">that</hi> unfortunately I had never much of in my best days&#x2014;and in the days that are, it is lost to me altogether!</p>
<p>I have now been here a fortnight and, all that time have experienced no benefit from &#x201C;the change&#x201C;&#x2014;indeed have felt weaker and more spiritless than before I left home. At first I fancied myself suffering from the fatigues of the journey&#x2014;but there has been time surely to recover from that&#x2014;and I am not recovered&#x2014;</p>
<p>How are <hi rend="italic">you?&#x2014;</hi> I dare say you suffer as much as I do&#x2014;but you are more patient.</p>
<p>I have a dim recollection of having told you of a letter I had from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle inviting us in a <hi rend="italic">grand</hi> manner to come and be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> at Lann Hall. I could hardly make my refusal so amiable as common courtesy required&#x2014; I told her if I passed thro Dumfrieshire at all, I had accepted an invitation from <hi rend="italic">you&#x2014;</hi>and my time would be so short that it would not stand splitting into two visits&#x2014;but possibly I might <hi rend="italic">call</hi> at Lann!

Francis Chalmer, the wealthy neighbor who lived at 3 Cheyne Row and was also listed along with Domenick Ronca at no. 4, fits Charlotte Southam&#x2019;s description more; she remembered that the neighbor was &#x201D; &#x2018;something in the city&#x2019;&#x201D; whose &#x201C;household had for years shown all the solid stiffness of the city snobs, and ignored the Carlyles as insignificant. By this time they had discovered the importance of some of the callers and decided the Carlyles were worth knowing, but &#x2018;there was nothing doing,&#x2019; according to Charlotte&#x201D; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 5:329). JWC was certainly on speaking terms with him (see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-04-11">11 April 1856</date></ref>), but the Carlyles were friendly with the Gilchrists. Conjecturally dated by Wilson, placing it about two weeks after their arrival; TC had arrived at Humbie <date when="1859-06-24">24 June</date>, and JWC, <date when="1859-06-28">28 June</date>.</sourceNote><head>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Stamps</hi> came, prompt &#x26; right, on Saturday morning; the Coffee, Saturday night (excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> stuff, as I can testify on two trials),&#x2014;the carriage was 5d, as I find all parcels now are; 2d to him of the Wallet, who indeed deserves something. The best will be that you <hi rend="italic">bring</hi> us over whenever you come a d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of coffee (if you can be bothered with it),&#x2014;the ruinous expense of Carriage may thus be evaded, if it cannot be borne!</p>
<p>Your Letter did not come till this morn<hi rend="italic">g:</hi> the performances of the Post-Office in these parts are apt to be very oblique.</p>
<p>I went along to Auchtertool from the shore, that night;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1859-07-15">15 July</date>; TC rode along the shore towards Burntisland and then 2 mi.

Went to Fergus&#x2019;s next day; a labourious<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> futile, rather dreary day; was utterly quiet yesterday; and have still a touch of my bronch<hi rend="italic">s,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> dainty I had rather want. Jane is still at Auchtertool; I do not see for certain how she is to get home today either; all being <hi rend="italic">damp</hi> and cold-steamy,&#x2014;after a good dose of rain we have had. She was well, when I rode over again yester night; I do not think I shall go again on the same terms so late. Rain did not begin fairly till 5 a. m., it appears, tho&#x2019; it threatened much when I left the Manse at 10 the night before.</p>
<p>I ought now to try for a slight turn of <hi rend="italic">Prussia,&#x2014;</hi>pity <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> pity <hi rend="italic">me</hi>! There is no end to bother shovelled on one, now from this hand now from that.</p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>A good while ago (I am ashamed to acknowledge my neglect by saying so, but it was not intentional, nor is it quite with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> excuse), your massive impressive Volume<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A Critical Dictionary of English Literature and British and American Authors</hi> (Philadelphia, <date when="1858">1858</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871">71</date>). Allibone had sent the first volume of this work to TC <date when="1858-12-00">Dec. 1858</date>, with the inscription: &#x201C;I beg herewith to present you with a copy of A Critical Dictionary of English Literature and British and American Authors. / I shall be pleased to hear that this volume has reached its destination, and gratified if my labours prove so fortunate as to secure your approbation&#x201D; (Carlyle&#x2019;s House, Chelsea).</note> was duly handed in at Chelsea;&#x2014;nor did I fail to look a little into it, tho&#x2019; exceedingly busy then, &#x26; now.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-35-151" n="35:151"/>I can truly say the labour you have gone into (which appears to be faithfully done, wherever I can judge of it) fills me with astonishment; and is indeed of an amount almost frightful to think of. There seems to be no doubt the Book will be welcome to innumerable reading beings, and tell them much that they wish to know: to me the one fault was, that, like the Apostle Peter&#x2019;s Sheet of Beasts, it took in &#x201C;the clean and unclean,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Acts 10:9&#x2013;15.</note>&#x2014;and thereby became of such unmanageable <hi rend="italic">bulk,</hi> to say no more. Readers are not yet aware of the fact, but a fact it is of daily increasing magnitude, and already of terrible importance to readers, That their first grand necessity in reading is to be vigilantly conscientiously <hi rend="italic">select;</hi> and to know everywhere that Books, like human souls, are actually divided into what we may call &#x201C;sheep and goats,&#x201C;&#x2014;the latter put inexorably on the <hi rend="italic">left</hi> hand of the Judge;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 25:32&#x2013;33.</note> and tending, every goat of them, at all moments, whither we know; and much to be avoided, and if possible ignored, by all sane creatures!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This is candidly my verdict; and I regret to think you cannot well like it; nor as you perceive, had I any wish to produce it, till summoned.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many respects and acknowledgements. / Yours sincerely,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I heard from the Doctor that you were a little better; but I wish very much to hear that you are well,&#x2014;at all events to hear again, <hi rend="italic">how</hi> you are. I hope Jim<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her son James, home from London.</note> and you have made out your little excursion, and are &#x201C;at the sea-side,&#x201D; or in some quiet fresh place; also that you have better <hi rend="italic">weather</hi> than some of us have now got. Here, for instance, after a week&#x2019;s fierce blowing from the West, with every appearance of rain but little or none in actuality, the fall has at last actually come, and we are thick in the second day of it,&#x2014;tedious dashings and splashings from the East, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> never do very much execution, and sometimes fall away almost into the state of blown &#x201C;Scotch-mist,&#x201D; but wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> never altogether cease, and have now reduced us to a most slippery impassable and altogether muddy and imprisoned condition. Last night latish, I sallied out in defiance; had a most strange walk of 3 or 4 miles, among wood by the brink of the sea, wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> had not the path itself been so sloppy and slippery, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have <pb id="pg-35-152" n="35:152"/>been quite tolerable, or even pleasant and interesting, so absolutely new, and unlike what one is used to, nothing but pattering rain, loud wind (mostly in the tree-tops), and solitude absolute. I have not today been out at all; but mean to have a ride by and by, however wet it be.&#x2014; Jane does wonderfully hitherto, tho&#x2019; the Cuddy has stood idle since Thursday;&#x2014;she went off, the day after, to Auchtertool Manse, and did not get home till yesterday (Monday) again, ever since wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> time the rain has been busy more or less. Cuddy does his duty admirably, and is an unexceptionable animal; won&#x2019;t have almost any corn, or any at all when &#x201C;full of <hi rend="italic">grass,</hi> Sir,&#x201C;&#x2014;but the Boy<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Thomson.</note> has now realised some bran, or other such substance, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> proves very acceptable.</p>
<p>As for me I believe myself to be improving in health, and endeavour to be content under the confusions and obstructions of such an Establish<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and to take patiently the almost total failure to get any work done. My &#x201C;work,&#x201D; my <hi rend="italic">undoable</hi> &#x201C;work&#x201D;; that is the first thing that rises on me in the mornings: &#x201C;Thou wretch, how wilt <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> ever do that undoable? What will become of thee!&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;History of Noureddin Ali and Bedreddin Hassan,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights&#x2019; Entertainments.</hi></note>&#x2014; This place is altogether beautiful extremely; better bathing is not in the world, nor a prettier outlook, nor purer air than here on the Hill top. Good honest people, too, tho&#x2019; very rough, unrid, and rustic in their ways. The <hi rend="italic">essentials</hi> of life are all here, however; and we reckon ourselves lucky, and make no complaint. &#x201C;What is to be done when Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th</hi> arrives?&#x201D; that is the only regretful question: and we do not yet succeed in answering it at all. I am clear for Annandale before long after leaving this: but Jane, in her feckless state, is much more difficult to dispose of.</p>

Meanwhile, you, I hope, will come over again Friday or Saturday: that is always the easiest plan for my loitering self!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This morning came a Letter from Scotsbrig, inviting us (or rather <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> I guess?) to come thither for a week, after our Humbie term was out: young Jamie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His nephew James Carlyle.</note> was the writer; no other news; all going on fairly except that <hi rend="italic">rain</hi> was still wanted. The Letter is in the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> room somewhere; I might have <hi rend="italic">sought</hi> it, as the shorter method at present.&#x2014; Of course I mean to see Scotsbrig &#x26;c before leaving the Country, and to spend several weeks in Annandale. But things are in a kind of undeveloped state, as to our motions: and indeed this is one of the tasks I am going again to impose on your good nature,&#x2014;to help us in that matter. We <hi rend="italic">end</hi> here, as you know, Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th:</hi> Erskine, whom I rather wish to see, indicates that &#x201C;after the 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of Aug<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> any day,&#x201D; is the time:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Erskine wrote to JWC, <date when="1859-07-12">12 July</date>, from Linlathen, Dundee: &#x201C;I hope we shall have sight of you here with Mr Carlyle&#x2014; Any time except the first ten days of August we shall be delighted to receive you.&#x201D;</note> so that a question arises, Could not we be permitted to stay here an additional week? Mrs Thomson had told the Misses Welsh, she was of opinion Professor Struthers<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. John and Christina Struthers had booked Humbie Farm from <date when="1859-08-06">6 Aug.</date> Dr. Struthers was a lecturer on anatomy, Surgeons&#x2019; Hall, Edinburgh, and became prof. of anatomy, Aberdeen Univ., <date when="1863">1863</date>.</note> (who had in some sort mistaken her meaning, owing to her deafness or somehow, in regard to her final engaging with him) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> possibly or probably consent to give us a week&#x2019;s delay: but she says today, when applied to, <hi rend="italic">You</hi> know the Professor, and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be far the best man to make the proposal to him. Could you conveniently? Of course it is not a weighty matter even to us; and unless the &#x201C;week&#x201D; were almost a matter of indifference to the Professor, we c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not ask him to allow it us. If indeed he c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give up his Humbie <pb id="pg-35-154" n="35:154"/>Bargain altogether, and leave us to work out our <hi rend="italic">full</hi> problem here, it would be worth while to make that a request, for that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a real saving of bother to us, and a favour to be acknowledged! But of that, I guess, there is not the least chance. Meanwhile, if you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> state the &#x201C;week&#x201D; project to him, and find his real posture towards it, please do so, the sooner the better:&#x2014;but if you dislike the job, <hi rend="italic">tell me so,</hi> and I will write to him. That will be quite the same or nearly so. Only (as I <hi rend="italic">now</hi> perceive!) no time is to be lost.</p>
<p>I also want &#xa3;25, notes 15, and 10 sovereigns. Can you bring these over from y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Banker, and I will give <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a draught in return?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote a check, <date when="1859-07-22">22 July</date>: &#x201C;&#xa3;25 (to B<hi rend="italic">r</hi> John,&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> properly, thro&#x2019; his Banker&#x201D; (MS: NLS 20753).</note> Or if you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> handily, I will ride to Kirkcaldy, and manage the thing. <hi rend="italic">Ohe jam satis</hi> [Enough of this]!</p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>It is almost a month since we saw or heard of you; lazy and silent as I grow more and more, it is clearly proper, and has been for a while, that you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have a word from me: I am not sure that you even know our address hitherto!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We got up hither without accident, tho&#x2019; with plenty of bother, pre-arrangement and also <hi rend="italic">post-</hi>d<hi rend="italic">o:</hi> but we have been doing rather well here, since these multifarious operations were well over. We have fine wholesome clean quarters,&#x2014;very rustic, simple, but honest and in all essentials complete; with horse-keep, and human accommodation (of milk and meal, with shops, too, accessible) very much to my mind. The Dame rides on an Ass;&#x2014;an importation, <pb id="pg-35-155" n="35:155"/>that, from native Dumfriesshire;&#x2014;I bathe, walk, loiter in woods; ride, too, with my horse in a flourishing state, horse astonished beyond measure at the new phenomena of nature here, the sea waves, the precipitous stony paths, the <hi rend="italic">cows</hi> almost most of all.&#x2014; It is one of the finest <hi rend="italic">scenes</hi> I ever saw in the world: woody airy Hills (mostly made of trap rock, &#x26; very well cultivated; ours a Farm House mounted on a knoll of its own, and looking free over the Forth and its Islands (Inch-<hi rend="italic">Colm</hi> has a monastery on it)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Inchcolm, an island &#xBC; mi. from the shore, opp. Aberdour (see frontispiece [viewable in the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi> on the table of contents page for vol. 35].); the monastery was founded by Alexander I, 1123.</note> and its steamers and ships special and miscellaneous, with Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 10 miles off on the other side, and mountains and green pleasant countries lying more directly across (for illustrious Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is somewhat to leftward): &#x201C;like a scene in a theatre,&#x201D; varying in aspect from hour to hour; truly I question if the Bay of Naples itself is prettier on a fine day. The Forth in fact is a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Firth</hi>&#x201D;; or Norway <hi rend="italic">Fiord;</hi> only in a fruitfuller country, with gentleman&#x2019;s Parks in it and the like. I try to be perfectly solitary; and am so for most part, silence being much better than any speech there is chance of. But the ground itself is eloquent to me, with memories of 40 years back and more;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had taught at the Burgh School in Kirkcaldy, <date when="1816">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1818">18</date>.</note>&#x2014;I find old friendly faces still extant too, tho&#x2019; in small number.&#x2014; I have been at Preuss, as you will see; poring and wriggling once again among these hideous Blockheadisms that have swallowed a Heroism nearly out of sight: what on Earth I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> to make of it; or how, from such mountains of incoherent dust and ashes, any <hi rend="italic">ingot</hi> (even of copper) is ever to be smelted? This question strikes into me, like a knife, the first thing, almost every morning. God help me with it! I was never as ill off in all my days with anything.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">You</hi> at least will be free before long, I hope: what you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do&#x2014;that is always a kind of hope to me in the matter.</p>

<p>I could with great readiness, and will if you persist in requesting it, give you a Note to Mr Ballantyne: but I doubt, at present, he is rather in the state of <pb id="pg-35-156" n="35:156"/><hi rend="italic">neap tide</hi> in regard to all that, and could not till his own affairs come to clearness be of much help in regard to yours.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Statesman,</hi> Ballantyne&#x2019;s newspaper, had recently closed; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590320-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1859-03-20">20 March</date></ref>.</note> After considering, I took the liberty to write to Mr Delane, Editor of the Times,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Thadeus Delane (<date when="1817">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879">79</date>; <ref target="volume-35/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7440"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1841">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877">77</date>; for TC&#x2019;s opinion of him in <date when="1857">1857</date>, see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570223-TC-LA-01"><sic>32:95</sic><corr>TC to LA, <date when="1857-02-23">23 Feb. 1857</date></corr></ref>.

    <salute>Dear Lady Sandwich,</salute>
    <p>My wife wrote to you; but I think there has no return yet come; and now I am getting rather impatient to hear some small bulletin from you, all being so silent on that side of the world to us here. Please, one little word, to say how you are, and whether London stands where it did.</p>
    <p>We have been steady here, ever since quitting your neighbourhood; and, once the various adjustments and preliminaries were got thro&#x02019;, we have been doing tolerably well,&#x2014;or better than tolerably one of us, for I (an industrious bather &#x26;c) persuade myself I am getting daily benefit out of the free air, the <pb id="pg-35-157" n="35:157"/>idleness, the solitude, and the other fine elements round us here. The poor wife, I always hope, prospers a little too; tho&#x02019; it is evidently in a fainter degree: she has (not without difficulty) acquired a respectable Ass (called &#x201c;Cuddie&#x201d; in these localities), and rides on him, very moderately, when the weather is inviting: she is nearly incapable of walking, especially in these steep paths; and will not ride, either led by me on my own most trustworthy quadruped or driven in any vehicle by such a Jehu,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">See 2 Kings 9:20.</note>&#x2014;or in short in any way but on her own independent Cuddie. Unfortunately she has caught some whiff of cold in the late damp weather we have had, and does not go out at all: so that, for the last two days, she is rather below par. We depend much on the sun in this establishment! It is, in all weathers, one of the prettiest scenes the eye can look on; Edinburgh, and the Mountains and Islands, and the seas and woods, lying under one&#x02019;s windows, far and wide (Edinburgh 10 miles off, to south-east, <pb id="pg-35-158" n="35:158"/>with its sky-lights glancing on you): but in wet weather, all gets <hi rend="italic">slippery,</hi> slopy,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Thus in MS.</note> the woods an avoidable object, and the prevalence of <hi rend="italic">mud</hi> for a short time is extreme!&#x2014; We have <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Parks, no fewer, to stroll in, very pretty both, and wooded to the sea-brink: a Lord Moray&#x02019;s, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is carefully kept (tho&#x02019; the <hi rend="italic">Mansion,</hi> most of it, is lately burnt);<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lord John Stewart, 12th earl of Moray, owned Donibristle Park; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590630-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1859-06-30">30 June</date>

<p>All right, dear Brother; &#x201C;it is probably just as well!&#x201D; Jane says, If this continual &#x201C;Haar&#x201D; last, the sooner we are away the better perhaps. At all events we have lost no time over Struthers, nor incurred any obligation to him. Thank Dr Gardiner for his trouble; you no doubt have done so.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1859-07-23">23 July</date>, that he asked Dr. John Gairdner to consult Dr. John Struthers about postponing his arrival at Humbie. Apparently Christina Struthers was an invalid (she had her first child, Alexander, <date when="1858-05-00">May 1858</date>, and was expecting her second; James was b. in Dec.) and needed a change of air. John wrote, <date when="1859-07-24">24 July</date>: &#x201C;After what I told you in my note of yesterday morning, you will hardly be surprised to hear that Struthers &#x2018;cannot put off his visit to Humbie beyond the 6<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of next month.&#x2019; Gardener had held out some hope of persuading him &#x26; his family to go to the Highlands instead, but he could not succeed.&#x201D; Dr. John Gairdner (<date when="1790">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876">1876</date>), 45 Northumberland St., Edinburgh.</note></p>
<p>My Horse got lamed by the conceited Smith,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably an Aberdour blacksmith; possibly John Cunningham of Easter Aberdour or Alexander Forbes of High St., Aberdour.

<p>Jane continues weakly; <hi rend="italic">walks,</hi> twice, instead of <hi rend="italic">mounting</hi> anything; and, yesterday, even lost her way in the shady wood of Humbie. Her rheumatic symptoms are happily quite gone.</p>
<p>The Boy is waiting; as I mean to be over tomorrow (unless <hi rend="italic">wet</hi>), I need not detain him or you longer. <hi rend="italic">Noon</hi> is my likeliest time for starting (unless I awake too early); then home again, probably by <hi rend="italic">Burnt</hi>d at Six.</p>

<salute>Dear Larkin,</salute>
<p>I have been in so utterly somnolent and dreamy a state, I have not till lately recollected that I never even sent you money to pay for the &#x201C;Register&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Desk,</hi> the Broken Window, and other material fractions of things which you were getting set to rights for me! Here at least is money<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC sent a check: &#x201C;<date when="1859-07-31">31 july 1859</date> / &#xa3;15..0..0 / to H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Larkin / (for <hi rend="italic">Desk</hi>, window / &#x26;c &#x26;c)&#x201D; (MS: NLS 20753).</note> for these objects; pray have them all sleeked off, and put comfortably to rest before I shew face again.</p>
<p>We have done pretty well here, at least I individually have, in regard to what was the principal intention of the voyage out: recovery of a little bodily improvement, and allowing of the cloudy bottles to settle a little into <hi rend="italic">sediment,</hi> and become clearer in consequence. Certainly nobody could get into a more opposite way of life than this is from our London one; and for myself I must brag (or confess, I know not wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>) I have very completely surrendered myself to the genius of the new Locality, and gone about as idle as was well possible for me during these 5 weeks. The place is one of the finest I ever saw for outlooks and situation: seas, mountains, cities, woods, fruitful cornfields; all is here in perfection, solitude, silence and a horse superadded: bathing, sauntering; walking, galloping; lazily dreaming in the lullaby of the woods &#x26; <pb id="pg-35-160" n="35:160"/>breezes, this has been nearly altogether my employment since you saw me lift anchor. Tho&#x2019; Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, by three Steamers daily, is but ten miles from us, and always in view from the windows, I have only been twice in Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> for a few hours; and then <hi rend="italic">only</hi> upon urgent practical call.</p>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> read or re-read several <hi rend="italic">7-Years War</hi> Affairs, too; and cannot get that terrible problem shaken out of my head altogether; but as to sending you reasonable material for doing <hi rend="italic">Maps</hi> upon it, I find, on trial, that it will not do;&#x2014;find in short that I must shove the whole matter off <hi rend="italic">till I get home again;</hi> and what will become of it <hi rend="italic">then</hi> is frightful to think of! A word from you soon will be very welcome.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin replied, <date when="1859-08-02">2 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;It is quite a comfort to me to learn that you have been so thoroughly &#x2018;idle&#x2019; since you left home, and still more to find you speaking of it as a successful and almost triumphant feat! I had been reproaching myself with being a great deal <hi rend="italic">too</hi> successful in the very same enterprise; and now I already begin to please myself upon having found something laudable in which I can claim complete &#x2018;equality&#x2019; (to say nothing of the &#x2018;liberty&#x2019; I am taking) with you.&#x201D;</note> <closer><salute>Yours always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I was sorry to hear, from John on Friday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC writes on Sun.</note> both that you had not yet made out your little week of holiday, and also that you had still some need of it, owing to the ill fit you had lately had. Your project of taking your week in these neighbourhoods was very pretty, and interested and almost affected me; but I do not think it would have turned to a good account. These coasts are full of Edinburgh ramblers, mostly of the <hi rend="italic">snob</hi> description; and the ways of them and of the lodgings they frequent w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have been agreeable to you.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken wrote to John A.

<p>We leave this place on Friday;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1859-08-05">5 Aug.</date></note> a confused hampered place, tho&#x2019; the people are good, and it has done well enough in the circumstances.

Besides you have no idea how feeble and feckless poor Jane is: how little good could be had of her, either in a lodging of your own or in closer contact.</p>
<p>My own idea is, it will suit your <hi rend="italic">health</hi> best if you fairly renounce excursion projects, and&#x2014;go honestly over to The Gill with a week&#x2019;s needlework in your bag, and a pound of good tea &#x26;c &#x26;c, and <hi rend="italic">there</hi> pass your holiday in a silent manner!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken also wrote: &#x201C;I have been at the Gill <hi rend="italic">very</hi> often this summer &#x2026; &#x26; I have given up thoughts of stirring for the present.

<salute>Dear Scott,</salute>
<p>Your Letter reached me two days ago, in the agony of a <hi rend="italic">flitting</hi> operation (over from Aberdour quarter to this new locality); and I could not command as much deliberation as to answer it, till now.</p>
<p>I am by no means surprised you should eagerly wish to quit Manchester, your vocation now being what it is there, and the &#x201C;Owen College,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Owens Coll., Manchester, founded by John Owens (<date when="1790">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846">1846</date>) in <date when="1846">1846</date>. Scott had been principal <date when="1851">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857">1857</date> (see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500501-TC-TOCM-01"><sic>25:78</sic><corr>TC to TOCM, <date when="1850-05-01">1 May 1850</date></corr></ref>) and was still prof. of English lang. and lit. as well as of moral and mental philosophy. He wrote, <date when="1859-08-02">2 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I wished to be otherwise occupied than in offering Comparative Grammar and Moral Philosophy to devout young believers of the Manchester School.&#x201D;</note> under <pb id="pg-35-162" n="35:162"/>such pilotage,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prof. Joseph Gouge Greenwood (<date when="1821">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1894">94</date>; <ref target="volume-35/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11439"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) had succeeded Scott as principal.</note> unalterable by all <hi rend="italic">your</hi> efforts, having got into the shallows inevitable in that case. I ardently wish you were well away, and completely rid of such an enterprize.</p>
<p>They say <hi rend="italic">founding</hi> a new magazine<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott told TC that he had been offered the editorship of the new periodical <hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine</hi>; it was intended to be &#x201C;an organ of individual writers of high standing. &#x2026; It would weigh much in favour of my undertaking the work could you take part in it, or even entertain the proposal as not inadmissible.&#x201D;</note> is a work of terrible difficulty, and especially almost always of unexpected <hi rend="italic">expense</hi> to the finance parties;&#x2014;I have no doubt there is labour abundant, and contradiction d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is the sorest kind of labour) for any one that faithfully grapples with <hi rend="italic">editing</hi> such a thing! I do not personally know your Publishers<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Smith, Elder &#x26; Co.: George Murray Smith (<date when="1824">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1901">1901</date>; <ref target="volume-35/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36138"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) and Alexander Elder (<date when="1790">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876">1876</date>).</note> at all, and have heard very little of them either, tho&#x2019; that little was on the favourable hand; if you can better inform yourself on that hand, I need not say how important that will be. Advice of my own in regard to any point of the matter, much more as to the great Yes-or-No question, I am totally unable to give:&#x2014;it seems to me rather you will, with your eyes open to the risks and questionabilities, probably decide &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;; and I am by no means prepared to <hi rend="italic">forbid,</hi> if you put it to me. In the tussle and scuffle there are generous elements too; and perhaps it will force you to strike out your limbs fairly at last, like a man thrown into the sea and <hi rend="italic">swimming</hi> for life (&#x201C;all real human <hi rend="italic">action</hi> is like <hi rend="italic">swimming,</hi>&#x201D; says Goethe; &#x201C;an element threatening to <hi rend="italic">swallow</hi> you; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you buffet frankly, and find that it will <hi rend="italic">bear</hi> you along&#x201D;):<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels, Works</hi> 24:321; cf. also <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi> 10:199.</note>&#x2014;if this <hi rend="italic">be</hi> the result produced, I shall say it is simply what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have wanted (to my notion) for these 20 years last past.</p>
<p>As to my own &#x201C;Contributing,&#x201D; there could be no vehicle suitabler to me,&#x2014;had I once anything to contribute!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Smith recalled: &#x201C;We secured the most brilliant contributors from every quarter. Our terms were lavish almost to the point of recklessness. No pains and no cost were spared to make the new magazine the best periodical yet known to English literature&#x201D; (&#x201C;Our Birth and Parentage,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine</hi> 10 n.s. [<date when="1901">1901</date>]: 6). Scott was presumably unaware that Smith had offered the editorship to several other individuals; Thackeray had agreed to be editor by late Aug. By the end of <date when="1860">1860</date>, the first year of publication, the magazine had included pieces by most well-known writers of the day, but TC never contributed; see also <ref target="volume-35/lt-18591020-TC-WMT-01">TC to WMT, <date when="1859-10-20">20 Oct.</date></ref></note> But my life is, as it were, hemmed in and bounded by the frightfullest of insoluble Enterprises; and till that be ended (if it don&#x2019;t first end <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> as often seems to me likely) I am simply Nemo [nobody] in Literature, and nothing but <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> can come of me to you or another. That is the sad fact.&#x2014; Decide <hi rend="italic">wisely:</hi> God grant that!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Note and <hi rend="italic">Sat</hi>y <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> arrived, during my after-breakfast smoke on the Lawn. We are beautifully lodged here, and shall have all things looped up into adjust<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and smoothly under way again, we hope, before long. Jane is better, and out on her Cuddy this day for the first time,&#x2014;day being very fine. I bathed, as well as posted my Letters, that Saturday Ev<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> but have not since tried the sea,&#x2014;being in some doubts about the propriety of it in present circumstances. The fact is, my <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> has developed itself ever since you left me, in a quite uncomfortable degree; and tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> on the growing hand (since Saturday morning) is decidedly uncomfortable; and has such a hold of me as, I feel, will not quit all at once, or without means used. I am off to Kirkcaldy today for&#x2014;blue pill &#x26; castor! That, with careful avoidance of evidently evil influences, will set it off again in a few days, I hope. There is not much or indeed almost any cough; but the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of the windpipe is sorish, &#x26; the <hi rend="italic">phlegm</hi> needs to be got out (usually by one <hi rend="italic">hotch</hi> of cough) from time to time thro&#x2019; the day. The usual slightly feverish <hi rend="italic">skin,</hi> and gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> feel of cold: this is the whole phenomenon. I will appoint some day for meeting you. <hi rend="italic">Hither</hi> to dinner, beyond all doubt!&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am very glad to see your Letter, tho&#x2019; the Museum account &#x26;c are none of the best.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote, <date when="1859-08-08">8 Aug.</date>, to report that he could not find the books that TC had requested in the British Museum lib. TC had apparently sent other requests, as Neuberg wrote, <date when="1859-07-28">28 July</date>, to report on a visit to Cheyne Row: &#x201C;Last week I went in search of the above-mentioned M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Southam to get access to your books. Found her; told my errand. &#x2018;But, Sir, you see, I don&#x2019;t know you; how could I entrust you with the Keys?&#x2019; Here was a case! To all my candour and persuasion I could only get a &#x2018;Yes Sir, certainly; but you see&#x2014;.&#x2019; At last she bethought herself that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> C. <hi rend="italic">had</hi> said something about somebody who might come: was I that somebody? Of course I was, and so I succeeded after all. In your study I found the Books I wanted, but no ink or pen.&#x2014; The Cat attended me all the time I was there: whether from love or suspicion I know not.&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> I meant to write to you yesterday; but an &#x201C;importunate&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> came in the way.

<salute>My dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I fear you have been continuing out of sorts, or you would have been writing to ask what ailed me, that I did not answer your former letter. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> are <pb id="pg-35-167" n="35:167"/>too good for standing on the <hi rend="italic">Debit and Credit</hi> principle of correspondence; and besides I think you feel pretty sure that whenever I fail in answering you, something else than mere want of goodwill must be in the case.</p>
<p>The fact is I made no progress at Humbie, and got more and more disheartened; and put off writing in hopes always of gaining a little strength and a little spirit to take some resolution about going to you&#x2014; And besides I needed to know what M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C intended before I could arrange for myself.</p>
<p>As the Lodging at Humbie could not be retained after the 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> we removed to this House&#x2014;within half a mile of my Cousins. It is a large convenient House, but out of repair and not in a state for being <hi rend="italic">Let</hi> (the Proprieter thinks) and so it was offered us rent-free&#x2014;my Cousins undertaking to put enough rooms in order&#x2014; I must say Maggie has acted like a beneficent Fairy in the matter&#x2014;and prepared a most comfortable lodging for us. If we had only the grace to enjoy it! But M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C with his absurd over fatigues at Humbie&#x2014;(bathing twice a day &#x26;c &#x26;c) and, I think, with excessive consumption of milk and cream, brought on a severe bilious attack at the commencement of which he arrived here! and of course could find no beauty or comeliness in anything!&#x2014;and all poor Maggies pains have gone for nothing. And the two or three inconveniences inseparable from a <hi rend="italic">country</hi> situation are magnified into overbalancing all the good. And he <hi rend="italic">talks</hi> of going off at once into Annandale and leaving me to do out the time here by myself&#x2014; I should rather like that he did&#x2014;for weak and nervous as I am, this constant worry about little things that can&#x2019;t be remedied, and constant sense of responsibility prevents me getting the least good of the change of air and quiet of the Country. And two weeks even of perfect let-alone-ness would be a Great rest for me&#x2014;</p>
<p>Finding I did not get <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> any visiting about in these first weeks&#x2014;I had given up my first plan of going to see you from here and returning&#x2014;my second plan was to take Thornhill<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Mary Russell lived.</note> on my road home. But now I am so out of heart, that I see nothing for it but to go straight home from here, without seeing you at all Dear!&#x2014;merely staying a night at York or somewhere to break the dreadful long journey&#x2014; I can&#x2019;t give you more indubitable evidence of how poorly I feel than by resigning myself to this arrangement. It is not only the stopping at Thornhill you see&#x2014;that I have to consider&#x2014; if I go <hi rend="italic">there,</hi> it involves me in the fatigue and bother of going to see Jane Carlyle<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken at Dumfries.</note> and going to the Gill&#x2014;and going to Scotsbrig&#x2014;were M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C there&#x2014; And for all that I am perfectly unfit!</p>
<p>So you wont think it unkind of me after all your kind invitations&#x2014;that I sacrifice one of the greatest pleasures I looked forward to in Scotland&#x2014;that of seeing you and the Doctor&#x2014;to the fear of arriving at home more unwell than <pb id="pg-35-168" n="35:168"/>I left it&#x2014;and giving myself and others all that trouble of illness over again&#x2014;<closer><salute>God bless you&#x2014;write and tell me particularly how you are</salute></closer></p>

You need not disturb yourself ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my cold: it seems to be pretty clearly in the way of retiring; and indeed, all along, since the almost a week past, my chief complaint has been the shorter my nerves got by the <hi rend="italic">remedy</hi> applied in adverse circumstances! The effect of that naturally is daily abating. I rode, very slowly, yesterday to Humbie, thro&#x2019; the beautiful balmy air, and sabbath silence, along by the bounteous yellow autumn fields; had a beautiful quiet bathe, in our old secluded bay yonder; &#x26; came softly home by the short road, smoking a cigar: Jane had been loud ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it; but it did me a great deal of good,&#x2014;and brought four hours of right <hi rend="italic">deep</hi> sleep to me on the sofa here; so that I took no dinner till six, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> time gathering myself to recollection of the flight of time and the daily epochs, I did awaken. Last night too I managed to get some 4 or 5 hours, in spite of such forestalment;&#x2014;and in short, I consider myself steadily recovering; and, by <hi rend="italic">canny</hi> manage<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> hope to cast out this &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> in the larynx&#x201D; too, and be on my old footing again. Jane too is rather better, since you saw us on that sorry Saturday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle had visited the Carlyles with John Gordon on Sat. <date when="1859-08-13">13 Aug.</date>, getting back to Edinburgh in &#x201C;less than two hours from the time we left you&#x201D; (<date when="1859-08-14">14 Aug.</date>).</note> when she was about the worst. Auchtertool with its big rooms &#x26;c seems to agree better with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> than Humbie did: for my share I feel only what a horrid burble is pretty certain always when you <hi rend="italic">flit</hi> at all! The weather is supremely beautiful; it is worth some expenditure to have the fair privilege of such skyey and telluric gifts from Heaven!&#x2014; I am to ride (slowly) down to Kirkcaldy, and get some <hi rend="italic">money</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC noted in his checkbook, <date when="1859-08-15">15 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;(Self, <hi rend="italic">Kirkcaldy</hi>) &#xa3;25..0..0&#x201D; (MS: NLS 20753).</note> along with a bathe: that is my day&#x2019;s &#x201C;duty.&#x201D; In the even<hi rend="italic">g</hi> I read <hi rend="italic">Friedr</hi>h Books; at times there begin to be gleams of possibility (at last!) in the enormous Quagmire itself: perhaps I shall <hi rend="italic">get</hi> it humanly drained after all; and then&#x2014;!</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute>&#x2014;I am pretty much on my legs again. Yesterday I staid quiet under the rain, busy with a Prussian Book; &#x201C;dined&#x201D; on a <hi rend="italic">zambaio</hi> (if that is the name of the almost imaginary quantity); then went out in the ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> on a long ride, almost to Kinghorn<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seaside town, about 4 mi. SSE of Auchtertool; see frontispiece [viewable in the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi> on the table of contents page for vol. 35].</note> &#x26;c. Supper of <hi rend="italic">porridge,</hi> and a good night&#x2019;s sleep (the first I have yet had here, or nearly so) followed these operat<hi rend="italic">ns.</hi> Today I am for Aberdour and a bathe, if the weather hold up at all.</p>
<p>I answer Spedding,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Story Spedding.</note> that Jane is out of the question; that, as to me, I am about coming south, and that in a fortnight or so, he <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> be answered.&#x2014; I rather fear there will nothing come of the scheme at present: visits, with their need of new march-routes, and the endless bother, do not suit me at present. I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like much to be off from the Linlathan bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> itself,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Visiting Thomas Erskine at Linlathen, nr. Dundee.</note> if I handsomely could.</p>
<p>The Postman, to whom I spoke today, says you have only to address &#x201C;Aucht<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, Kirkcaldy&#x201D; (no &#x201C;Post-Office&#x201D; or other adjunct), and that the Parcel will be immediately delivered to him;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201D; &#x2018;Walking&#x2019; postmen leave [Kirkcaldy] about 8.50 am for Auchtertool, Kinghorn &#x26;c., &#x26; return in time for afternoon&#x2019;s earliest dispatch&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Westwoods&#x2019; Parochial Directory</hi> [Cupar, <date when="1862">1862</date>] 142).</note>&#x2014;nay the day after tomorrow, he will demand it at the Railway Office, if not. Wherefore, on these terms, <hi rend="italic">despatch,</hi> pray, and we will wash our hands of that small bus<hi rend="italic">ss.</hi></p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Sat</hi>y <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> is remarkably shallow &#x26; barren, when one pierces thro&#x2019; the trenchant &#x26; conceited airs it gives itself:&#x2014;I despatch always to Jamie jun<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> after a cursory perusal.

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your kind little Note; the friendly honest sound of your voice is welcome to me again!</p>
<p>We are certainly bound Southward before long; and certainly I will by no means forget Mirehouse<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Spedding family home on Bassenthwaite Lake, 4 mi. N of Keswick, Cumberland. TC had stayed there in <date when="1847">1847</date> with Spedding&#x2019;s father, John (<date when="1770">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851">1851</date>), and brother, James, and then visited Spedding at Greta Bank; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471008-TC-MAC-01"><sic>22:121&#x2013;22</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1847-10-08">8 Oct. 1847</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471010-TC-JWC-01"><sic>125</sic><corr>TC to JWC, [<date when="1847-10-10">10 Oct. 1847</date>]</corr></ref>. As the older brother, Thomas Spedding had presumably inherited Mirehouse on his father&#x2019;s death.</note> when once on the Scottish Border!&#x2014; My Wife, with many thanks and regrets, is obliged to say at once that she is out of the game,&#x2014;being, in sad fact, far too weak for visiting operations. As for me, if I find it feasible at all, you need not doubt I will aim towards you for a day or two; but the route is all in chaos as yet; much is in &#x201C;chaos,&#x201C;&#x2014;and a good deal of it likely to continue there!</p>
<p>If I live to get out of this last Prussian Scrape (by far the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> I ever got into, and appointed at any rate to be the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> in my life), it is among my dreams to come to Mirehouse mounted on horseback, and <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> in right earnest for ten days there. Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>In a fortnight or so I will answer more definitely as to this present adventure,&#x2014;fortnight <hi rend="italic">or so;</hi> and in the meanwhile, humbly commending myself to Mrs Spedding, to <hi rend="italic">Baco Redivivus</hi> [Bacon Revived],<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Spedding worked for over 30 years on <hi rend="italic">The Works of Francis Bacon</hi> (<date when="1857">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874">74</date>).</note> and everybody near you, I am always</p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to get hold of you again with a definite British date: the last notice I had, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> came to me in these parts, was from some Chasm in the Pyrenees; and indeed you have been a most wandering Entity for a long while past. I left a notice of my whereabouts, in the end of june, at Bath House:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Bath House, Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s London home, see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:200</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10-22">22 Oct. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> I had heard from you once, many months before, from Malta; to wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I responded, <pb id="pg-35-171" n="35:171"/>directing upon Cairo;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons had been away on honeymoon; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590130-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1859-01-30">30 Jan.</date></ref></note> but whether the missive ever got to hand I did not learn. Lady Sandwich kept us informed of your general proceedings; and from her I learned a while ago that you had actually reappeared in England,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In late July; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590723-TC-LS-01">TC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LS</corr>, <date when="1859-07-23">23 July</date></ref>.</note> and were bending Northward; nay, by another accident, the approximate time of your transit thro&#x2019; Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> became known to me;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They were on their way to Brahan Castle, Lady Louisa&#x2019;s family home in Ross-shire; Lady Sandwich wrote to TC, <date when="1859-08-01">1 Aug.</date>, that Lady Louisa &#x201C;told [her] the Gardens at The Grange were not to be compared to those at B. Castle whither they are now gone.&#x201D; John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1859-08-07">7 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;The Ashburtons &#x2026; are to be here on Tuesday [<date when="1859-08-09">9 Aug.</date>], and remain a day or two.&#x201D;</note> and I might have caught you up there, had not an ugly Cold laid me in limbo just then, and forbidden all adventures of that kind. In short I am very glad to have you descend out of the air, and become a definite fact for me again! In October you will pass thro&#x2019; London;&#x2014;like your evil genius I give you rendezvous there; that is the place where I will meet you, if things go to my hope. And let us have no more of taking wing, or as little as possible! The only thing I like ill in your description is that &#x201C;incapacity of being at rest&#x201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord A wrote to TC, <date when="1859-08-14">14 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Now we are beginning to settle. For nine months we have been struggling on on; and tearing ourselves with regret from some stepping place on which we longed to rest. I cannot yet feel that I shall ever be at rest again, so unsettled have I become.&#x201D;</note> that is decidedly an unwholesome item; and must be striven with, and abated, if even with effort. Why not take <hi rend="italic">Buckle,</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Thomas Buckle, <hi rend="italic">History of Civilization in England</hi> (<date when="1857">1857</date>); for Buckle, see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590504-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1859-05-04">4 May</date></ref>.</note> and force yourself to sit still, in contemplation of the Progress of civil and religious Liberty all over the world? Better so I can assure you than plunging thro&#x2019; the wet heather after deer. Beware of deer, I seriously counsel! You actually ought to understand your limits,&#x2014;this year, by p[l]aying smart,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted by TC.</note> I am actually beginning to learn mine;&#x2014;for most part (I am persuaded) Buckle and the Infinitely Torpid is wholesome to you in comparison with deer! But we hope your fair Doctor<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Louisa.</note> will bring you back cured of this last infirmity too: let that be the crown of her beneficences, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> have been great hitherto.</p>
<p>I had a miserable year over my Prussian rubbish, after you left: I toiled day and night in that sordid element, after the manner of a <hi rend="italic">slave</hi> too literally, for there was nothing, or not enough, of wisdom in my method, and by sheer force it could not be done. I myself grew more and more stupid; that was nearly all the advance<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I could fairly notice! In that wild blast of winter; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was our month of <hi rend="italic">May,</hi> my poor wife had a dreadful attack of illness (probably <pb id="pg-35-172" n="35:172"/>the settling of her winter acc<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> in that kind): after much consultation, we decided to get awake, and take flight,&#x2014;hitherward, as it proved.</p>
<p>Her, I am grieved to say, it has not benefited much; yet I hope it has somewhat. As for me, I seemed to flourish greatly, especially for the first month while living close by the sea; but just in removing hither (some 3 miles inland, our term on the shore being out) I was taught a new lesson, and found that much of my &#x201C;improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi>&#x201D; had been mere biliary excite<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and that as the groom<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> says of my horse, I had <hi rend="italic">too much courage:</hi> &#x201C;so much courage, Sir, he goes whether he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> or <hi rend="italic">not!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; In fact I am quite miserable with this Prussian millstone hung round my neck; and have in gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> no wish but to get done with <hi rend="italic">it</hi> and then rest forevermore. Alas, the Highlands,&#x2014;tell her bounteous Ladyship, with my thanks and regrets,&#x2014;is far beyond us!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Louisa wrote at the end of Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s letter: &#x201C;Let me hear that you are both going to be good &#x26; kind, &#x26; come &#x26; see us &#x2026; &#x26; we will give you a real Highland welcome.&#x201D;</note> We go for Annandale in a 2 weeks; thence in perhaps 2 more, home to Chelsea. <closer><salute>Good be with you both &#x26; all.</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p>The shoes have arrived today (carriage 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>), and all is right there. Good tight shoes; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I think will be very easy, were they broken in.

<p>Jane is still weak here; and I too, tho&#x2019; always rather improving, am scarcely at par.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>As I sat here yesterday morning, all packed, in dreary but resigned mood after a baddish night and morning, silently waiting for Walter and the gig,&#x2014;Erskine&#x2019;s man<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly John Sim (b. ca. <date when="1812">1812</date>), Erskine&#x2019;s coachman; otherwise unidentified.</note> stept in with the Inclosed Letter; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> let off all the steam again; much to my relief, for the moment! I have this morning written kindly to Erskine, giving up the speculation altogether. Indeed it was much luckier. I am in no mood for doing visits; for dressing, discoursing, screwing up mind or body in any way.

<p>I got home rapidly with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the least damage on Saturday night.

<salute>Dear Lady Sandwich,</salute>
<p>Your little Note was very interesting; and brought us cheerful glimpses of the southern world; news of various kind,&#x2014;good news of yourself, for one thing, which was especially welcome. That deliverance out into the free air, and to peaceable thoughts and affectionate remembrances and hopes, with your grand-children<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Sandwich wrote from Hinchinbrook (Hinchingbrooke), nr. Huntingdon, <date when="1859-08-01">[1?] Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I am out disporting on a charming lawn with my G<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Children for 3 or 4 hours every day.&#x201D; Her son, John William Montagu, 7th earl of Sandwich, had six children, aged between 10 and 20; their mother, Mary, had d., <date when="1859-02-20">20 Feb.</date></note> running about you, in those old scenes so full of meaning for you: what a fine change from your long winter&#x2019;s imprisonment! I doubt not you have had ups and down since that date, for one never goes steady very long, and perhaps you have even <hi rend="italic">flitted</hi> before this time; but we hope you are still well enjoying the kind summer Earth and sky, in some kindly place, there or elsewhere, and laying up strength against the bad season that will come. It is with the scheme of picking another little packet of news from you that I write again from these Fife regions.</p>
<p>We had to quit our sea-side ruralities about three weeks ago; our term there being out, and a successor inexorably at the door. We took shelter here, three miles inland, in a small vacant Country Mansion that turned up; a far better Lodging, and essentially still a very pleasant region, nothing but fine green Hills all round us, green to the top, and excellent <hi rend="italic">white</hi> crops on the flanks of them (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are getting reaped just now on happy terms); an excellently <pb id="pg-35-175" n="35:175"/>cultivated Country, with strange hard <hi rend="italic">warts</hi> of rock starting up every here and there thro&#x2019; the sweep of greensward or wide expanses of corn: a very pretty country, with the Bass-rock Berwick Law<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bass Rock, 350 ft., crag off the East Lothian coast, 3&#xBC; mi. ENE of N. Berwick; Berwick Law, about 612 ft., hill S of N. Berwick.</note> and a bit of the sea still visible from our eastward windows,&#x2014;and all round, such a pother of steep heights and headlong chasms as was never seen before: terribly astonishing to my Cockney Horse (&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi>&#x201D; so-called), who cannot find fifty yards of level road, let him try where he will in this Country, for a bit of cantering! This particular piece of Earth (let me add, since y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ladyship is of historical turn) was at one time the property of the famed &#x201C;Kirkcaldy of Grange&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange (ca. <date when="1620">1520</date>&#x2013;<date when="1573">73</date>), soldier, politician, and Protestant supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots (<date when="1542">1542</date>&#x2013;<date when="1587">87</date>). He d. on the gallows, <date when="1573-08-03">3 Aug. 1573</date>, after he had defended Edinburgh Castle in support of Mary, (<date when="1571">1571</date>&#x2013;<date when="1573">73</date>.</note> Grange, his chief manor, is a mile or two off:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grange was 3&#xBD; mi.

I saw from the first what all that <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> as in seven league boots, and <hi rend="italic">galloping</hi> like the wild huntsman, and bathing in season and out of season like a merman and all that consumption of &#x201C;soft food was working together towards!&#x2014;a bilious crisis bad enough to make a poor wife&#x2019;s hair stand on end! and to make her ask herself twenty times a-day&#x2014;if it wouldnt be better to tie herself up to her bedpost and be done with it!</p>

<salute>My dear Miss Barnes</salute>
<p>How nice of you to have written me a letter, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all out of your own head</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> (as the Children say)! and how very nice of you to have remarked the <hi rend="italic">Forget-me-not,</hi> and read a meaning in it!&#x2014; It was certainly <hi rend="italic">with intention</hi> I tied up some <hi rend="italic">Forget-me-nots</hi> along with my farewell roses, but I was far from sure of your recognising the intention, and at the same time not <hi rend="italic">young</hi> enough to make it plainer. <hi rend="italic">Sentiment,</hi> you see, is not well looked on by the present generation of Women; there is a growing taste for <hi rend="italic">fastness</hi> or still worse, for <hi rend="italic">strongminded</hi>ness!&#x2014; <figure><graphic url="volume-35-179-17.gif"/><p>Jane Welsh Carlyle to Isabella Barnes, [24 August 1859] (detail)</p><p><hi rend="italic">Courtesy of the National Library of Scotland</hi></p></figure></p>
<p>So, a discreet woman (like <hi rend="italic">me</hi>!!) will beware always of putting her <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> (when she has any) in evidence&#x2014;will rather leave it, as in the Forget-me-not case, to be <hi rend="italic">divined thro&#x2019; sympathy; and, failing the sympathy</hi>, to escape notice.</p>
<p>And you are actually going to get married!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She m. John Simmonds, but not until <date when="1862-02-00">Feb. 1862</date>.</note> <hi rend="italic">You! Already!</hi> And you expect me to <hi rend="italic">congratulate</hi> you!&#x2014;or &#x201C;perhaps not.&#x201D; I admire the judiciousness of that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">perhaps not</hi>&#x201D;!&#x2014; Frankly, my Dear; I <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> you all happiness in the new life that is opening to you; and you are marrying under good auspices since your Father approves of the marriage. But&#x2014;congratulations on such occasions seems to me a tempting of Providence! The Triumphal-Procession air which in our Manners and Customs, is given to Marriage at the outset&#x2014;that singing of <hi rend="italic">Te Deum before</hi> the battle has <hi rend="italic">begun&#x2014;</hi>has, since ever I could reflect, struck me as somewhat senseless and somewhat impious! If ever one is to pray, if ever one is to feel grave and anxious if ever one is to shrink from vain show and vain babble&#x2014;surely it is just on the occasion of two human beings binding themselves to one another for better and for worse, till death part them; just on that occasion which it is customary to celebrate only with rejoicings, and congratulations, and <hi rend="italic">trousseaux</hi> and&#x2014;white ribbon! good god!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Will you think me mad if I tell you that when I read your words &#x201C;I am going to be married,&#x201D; I all but <hi rend="italic">screamed!</hi> Positively it took away my breath, as if I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> you in the act of taking a flying leap&#x2014;into Infinite Space! You had looked to me such a happy happy little girl! Your Father&#x2019;s only daughter, and he so fond of you, so proud of you as he evidently was! After you and he had walked out of our house together that night, and I had gone up to my own room&#x2014;I sat down there in the dark and took &#x201C;a good cry&#x201D;!&#x2014; You had reminded me so <pb id="pg-35-179" n="35:179"/><pb id="pg-35-180" n="35:180"/>vividly of my own youth, when I, also an only daughter&#x2014;an only Child&#x2014;had a Father as fond of me as proud of me!&#x2014; I wondered if you knew your own happiness! Well! knowing it or not, it has not been enough for you, it would seem! Naturally&#x2014; Youth is so insatiable of happiness, and has such sublimely insane faith in its own power to make happy and be happy!</p>
<p>But of your Father? Who is to cheer <hi rend="italic">his</hi> toilsome life and make home bright for <hi rend="italic">him?</hi> His companion thro&#x2019; half a life time gone! his dear &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bit of rubbish</hi>&#x201D; gone too&#x2014;tho&#x2019; in a different sense! Oh little girl! little girl! <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> the blank you will make to him?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Barnes&#x2019;s wife, Susannah, and older da., Laura, were dead; he had two sons.</note></p>
<p>Now, upon my honour, I seem to be writing just such a letter as a raven might write if it had been taught!</p>
<p>Perhaps the henbane<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A poisonous plant, sometimes used to induce sleep.</note> I took in despair last night has something to do with my mood today&#x2014;anyhow when one can only ray out darkness, one had best clap an extinguisher on oneself&#x2014; And so God bless you&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Dear Larkin,</salute>&#x2014;Would you read what is on the other side of this;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote on the reverse of John Bull&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1859-08-24">24 Aug.</date>; it was on notepaper with the printed address &#x201C;Great Scotland Yard, Charing Cross. S.W.&#x201D; and addressed to &#x201C;Professor Carlyle&#x201D;; it asked for the return of Bull&#x2019;s &#x201C;Poem of the Marriage of the Body &#x26; Soul after Death&#x201D; that he had sent to Chelsea about &#x201C;6 weeks or two months ago. &#x2026; I have thought since that as a Stranger I ought not to have bored you with it.&#x201D; John Bull, possibly a pseudonym, is otherwise unidentified.</note> and then call at Cheyne Row, and, by comparison of handwriting, and other survey, endeavour to pick out the disconsolate Mr Bull&#x2019;s affair, and, writing on it, &#x201C;returned by Mr Carlyle&#x2019;s direction,&#x201D; put it into that Cover, and into the Post,&#x2014;that his soul may live. I had already to write the foolish creature on this poor bus<hi rend="italic">ss;</hi> and sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like well it were despatched at once and forever. Probably the handwriting, and <hi rend="italic">date</hi> of Postmark (it must be some 6 weeks back), will prove suffici<hi rend="italic">t</hi> indication; but if you have any <hi rend="italic">doubt,</hi> open and see.</p>
<p>We had to remove hither 3 weeks ago, our term being out at Humbie. This is 3 miles inland, an infinitely better House, and still in beautiful Fife scenery <pb id="pg-35-181" n="35:181"/>familiar to me of old; but the want of the sea close at hand is something, so far as my account goes, and the mere change and its bother has been perhaps more. Mrs Carlyle does evidently better here; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a consolation for my going rather the other way hitherto. In two weeks, I am off Southward to my native regions; my Wife may stay (possibly) some 10 days more. <hi rend="italic">End</hi> of Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> we are fully due at Chelsea.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have not been prospering much since you saw me,&#x2014;especially since yesterday afternoon, when I <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> after dinner not wisely but too well,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> 5:2.</note> and had other adventures subsequent! However, I mean to take a new departure and course of procedure; and, in spite of larynxes and varicosities, to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> exercise enough, come how it can! One of those bad nights hurts even these local concerns more than direct pressure might; a good <hi rend="italic">sleep,</hi> when I can get one, is still medicine for the whole man. I am whole at heart, or think I am; I must not give in, at least not till the sorrowful <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi> is done. Jane, I do imagine, does better here than at Humbie; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a great compensat<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and may avail us both in the winter coming.</p>
<p>There were 14 new days Provender laid in for the Horse; within that time he and I must be off! I do not intend for Linlathen, notwithstanding Mr Erskine&#x2019;s Letter of today (friendliest of Letters), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I inclose.</p>
<p>It appears there is a supreme Woollen Drapery Shop, &#x201C;Paterson &#x26; Romanes,&#x201D; somewhere on the N<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Bridge (?):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Romanes &#x26; Paterson, silk mercers and tartan manufacturers, 59 N.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for the kind trouble you took with the Draper people,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Romanes &#x26; Paterson.</note> tho&#x2019; you were in haste! It will at least save me the trouble of calling there; and admonish to <hi rend="italic">give up</hi> the Scotch tailor speculat<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> London being evidently the handier <pb id="pg-35-184" n="35:184"/>place to get clothes in.&#x2014; I rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> your Note yesterday, a little later than usual; but had no opportunity to write, as the man immediately walks back again, on Sundays, after delivering his bag. I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of you with satisfaction on the old Scotsbrig Moor, strolling free under the bright sunshine there was. Today we have rain, and rather heavy at times: usually it has been mere Scotch-mist, or little more, till now. Liddell<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Liddell.</note> was out in force carrying together into stacks in the field (6 of them <hi rend="italic">intended</hi>, when I went out) the great quantity of dry stuff here contiguous to us,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you walked thro&#x2019;, the last night you were here. The Rain has cut him short, halfway up the second rick: four wooden trivets (&#x201C;horses,&#x201D; they are called, to make the centres of ricks) remain here in the field. All is nearly ripe here abouts together, and the people are in great press.</p>
<p>I know not whether this will still find you at Scotsbrig tomorrow: but hope you may not run away the instant Harry goes.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Watt left for Liverpool <date when="1859-08-30">30 Aug.</date></note> You might at least run over to The Gill, to Dumfries, and return with some definite impressions. I always hoped somehow you were to be within reach when I came to that Country myself,&#x2014;tho&#x2019;, on considering, I must own I do not see with any clearness how the feasibilities do lie! If you can so contrive it, of course it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be pleasant to me: but I know not whether you can.&#x2014; At any rate pray consider my case, and <hi rend="italic">investigate</hi> somewhat the cases of Scotsbrig, of The Gill; how they are forward with Harvest, how &#x26;c &#x26;c, in fact, what (without over-straining) their real capabilities for me are. I wanted to have, once more, some free conversat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> with Jamie;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His brother James at Scotsbrig.</note> at the Gill, I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> lodge, and it is usually wholesomest of all to me, tho&#x2019; rather lonesome &#x26; foreign. Consider what I can do, and what they; and <hi rend="italic">when</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> probably be the suitablest time. I can come off any day,&#x2014;have Horsemeat (<hi rend="italic">exuberant,</hi> it proves, any way!), but care not a doit ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> leaving any quantity of it. I am well housed here; but do not promise myself much benefit, or anything but a solace to laziness, by lingering here. Point out for me, if you can, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> time might be suitablest for the Annandale Localities and friends.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1859-08-30">30 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;[James] will be glad to see you here as soon as ever you can come. &#x2026; [He] bade me say expressly that his harvest is as good as ever, &#x26; that your coming would not in the least interfere with it.&#x201D;</note> Or if there is no time now &#x201C;suitable,&#x201D; I must just plunge off at random, and make my stay be shorter.</p>
<p>Jane evidently gathers strength here. She means <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to come down to Nithsdale, or at all out of her line; will go from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (sleeping at York), despatch Charlotte by steamer; and wishes to be &#x201C;home a week before me&#x201D; to have the house ready. She can, and evidently ought to stay here as long as there is heat in the weather;&#x2014;perhaps she will be <hi rend="italic">better</hi> without me, instead of otherwise.

<p>At present I am in considerable hurry, having foolishly mistaken the hour on my watch this morning, and lain (<hi rend="italic">perforce</hi>) a long while beyond my time!&#x2014;What little is in some sort definite about my journey Southward (sorry on all &#x201C;journies,&#x201D; they take such scheming and adjusting and bothering, and do not seem worth it to ones lazy mind!) lies in the following points:</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I know not well what I wrote to you last time, such a flurry and hurry was I in; and yesterday (Fergus coming in upon me, and <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> the night before <hi rend="italic">not</hi> having quite come), I had not the fair opportunity to write at all, as I intended. My gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> notion was that there w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be <hi rend="italic">room</hi> for us both at Scotsbrig, that we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be in one another&#x2019;s way &#x26;c &#x26;c: most of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seems to be a partial or complete <hi rend="italic">mistake</hi> of mine. You are very good to let the <hi rend="italic">thrawn</hi> mortal do as he will, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> snarling at him! He, on his side, ought <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> [for the stronger reason] to do the like by you, and study to forward nor to contradict what your wishes may be! Before y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter came I had decided to make for Burntisland, and across Tomorrow (Saturday) by the Noon Boat;&#x2014;so, if it be not fairly too wet for venturing, you may look for me bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> one &#x26; 2.

<p>In spite of all botherations, I do not feel to have gone backwards in the healthy way since coming hither, but on the contrary. However, it is clear I ought to lift my wallets now fairly, and walk.</p>

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>Before leaving Humbie I sorted all the letters I had received there; burning some, and tieing up others in a bundle, which was packed with some things not needed <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> in a box ready to be taken to London. Thus, when in the fulness of time, Nature prompted me to write to you; the address was at the bottom of that box, not to be realized without infinite trouble. (You must be aware by this time that I never <hi rend="italic">can</hi> keep addresses <hi rend="italic">in my mind,</hi> unless indeed I have <hi rend="italic">been to</hi> the place&#x2014;and you never invited me to your place!)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Cooke lived at 47 Mount St., Berkeley Sq. &#x201C;Fulness of time&#x201D;; cf. Gal. 4:4.</note> Well! I might, to be sure, have taken the &#x2018;infinite&#x2019; trouble!&#x2014;or the lesser trouble of asking your address from Geraldine! But&#x2014;there are states of mind&#x2014;or perhaps I should rather say states of Body&#x2014;when, as you must have experienced, or if you haven&#x2019;t experienced it you are too happy!&#x2014; The smallest obstacle in one&#x2019;s way is capable of turning one aside from it&#x2014;as if one were a billiard ball! And So&#x2014;!</p>
<p>But now is come another kind welcome letter, again putting the address before my eyes; and I should be a brute entirely, if I made not &#x201C;some reasonably good&#x201D; haste<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490707-JWC-TC-01"><sic>24:104</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1849-07-07">7 July 1849</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> to thank you!&#x2014;&#x2014;I am not at the <hi rend="italic">Manse</hi> but within a quarter <pb id="pg-35-188" n="35:188"/>of an hours walk of it&#x2014;in a large comfortable house lent us by a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Liddell&#x2014;And we should have done well here, had not M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C walked and rode and bathed himself into a bilious crisis just before leaving Humbie&#x2014;so that he began life here under the most untoward auspices, For the first fortnight indeed, it was, so far as myself was concerned, more like being keeper in a madhouse, than being &#x201C;in the Country&#x201D; for &#x201C;quiet&#x201D; and &#x201C;change&#x201C;&#x2014; Things are a little subsided <hi rend="italic">now</hi> however and in spite of the wear and tear on my nerves, I am certainly less languid and weak than during all my stay in the farm house&#x2014;whether it be that the air of Auchtertool suits me better than that of Aberdour; or that having my kind little Cousins within cry is a wholesome <hi rend="italic">diversion;</hi> or that it required a <hi rend="italic">continuance</hi> of Country air to act at all upon my feebleness&#x2014;I am not competent to say&#x2014;nor is it of the slightest earthly consequence what the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> is, so that the <hi rend="italic">effect</hi> has been as I tell you.</p>
<p>I have had a piece of news on my mind for you these two weeks&#x2014;little Miss Barnes&#x2014;(you remember her? remember her! will you ever forget her?) has found a Being she can love! and who <hi rend="italic">loves</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">her</hi>!!&#x2014; And the marriage will take place soon!&#x2014; As odd as any other part of my news is, that the little girl was moved in spirit to write and tell <hi rend="italic">me</hi> of her happiness!&#x2014; I &#x201C;had been so kind to her that evening&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014; Indeed the whole of her letter, which is excessively sentimental, breaths a spirit of beautiful <hi rend="small-caps">humility</hi> (!!) towards <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> and of young girl enthusiasm towards her lover and her Father and me and every body!&#x2014; Now&#x2014;will you ever judge from first impressions again?&#x2014; I could have taken my Bible Oath, that this little girl hadnt one spark of <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> or <hi rend="italic">humility</hi> (of all things) in her whole composition! I was as sure as if I had been &#x201C;up thro&#x2019; her and down thro&#x2019; her with a lighted Candle&#x201D; (to use an Annandale expression)&#x2014;</p>
<p>Poor Geraldine! I wish if a D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> was needed, she would have consigned herself to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes&#x2014;what do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> think ails her?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cooke wrote, <date when="1859-09-07">7 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;I hear from Geraldine that she is better but from others who have seen her amongst them her brother Frank&#x2014;I hear a dismal account of her great weakness and emaciation.&#x201D; Jewsbury had written to Mantell, <date when="1859-08-18">18 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;The D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> cannot imagine why I don&#x2019;t get better&#x2014;I cd tell him but it does not lie in his department&#x2014;I cannot even heartily wish to get well&#x201D; (Mantell Papers 321/8). The imminent departure of Walter Mantell for New Zealand was one reason for Jewsbury&#x2019;s illness. She wrote to him, <date when="1859-08-28">28 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> help you <hi rend="italic">lead</hi> a life worthy of you&#x2014;you need a woman to keep you straight to help and sustain you. &#x2026; I have the <hi rend="italic">female</hi> qualities w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you need &#x26; don&#x2019;t possess&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have all the strong qualities of character w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> bring out whatever of good I possess. &#x2026; Where will you find a woman who loves you as I do? How many women <hi rend="italic">could</hi>? &#x2026; I am independent. I can earn my own living &#x26; if I want more money I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get it. &#x2026; [T]ake me away with you or send to fetch me or else&#x2014;set y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> foot on my neck &#x26; kill me it is neither right nor just to leave me in this misery&#x201D; (Mantell Papers 321/12). Mantell left in Oct.</note>&#x2014; The letter she wrote to me about her illness was so <hi rend="italic">gay</hi> and amusing, that I did not think it indicated <pb id="pg-35-189" n="35:189"/>much the matter&#x2014;but I might have known by myself that the excitability of nerves which makes amusing letters is very compatible with serious ailment.</p>

If she is cruel sometimes and hard, at others she is more noble and generous than ninety-nine persons who need no repentance, and as to her <hi rend="italic">fascination</hi>, I appeal to yourself!&#x201D; (Howe 169).</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear William Dodds</salute>
<p>I want <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to tell me something.&#x2014; You divine what it is?&#x2014;that it relates to the matter I spoke to you of, a minute before we parted;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had visited Haddington for several days at the end of June.</note> only then; tho&#x2019; I had had it in my heart and <hi rend="italic">throat</hi> to say, during the whole time we were together alone!</p>
<p>That grave! is there quiet about it again? and grass beginning to grow?&#x2014;Tell me truly the state of things in the old ruin;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s father, Dr. John Welsh, was buried &#x201C;in &#x2026; the old Abbey Kirk, long a ruin, now [<date when="1866">1866</date>] being saved from further decay,&#x201D; in Haddington; JWC was buried beside him <date when="1866-04-26">26 April 1866</date> (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 194). St. Mary&#x2019;s Church, the &#x201C;Abbey Kirk,&#x201D; had been badly damaged in the siege of Haddington, <date when="1548">1548</date>&#x2013;<date when="1549">4</date>9. The nave at the W end of the church was restored (on John Knox&#x2019;s advice) and used as the parish church; but the tower, choir, and transepts remained in ruins until their restoration and reroofing in the <date when="1970">1970</date>s; Dr. John Welsh and JWC&#x2019;s grave in the choir is now inside the restored church.</note> I need to know, for my <pb id="pg-35-190" n="35:190"/>practical guidance; whether to go there now would do away with the impression made last time, or only deepen it?</p>
<p>As it is I am <hi rend="italic">haunted</hi> by what I saw&#x2014;that horror of trenching, and scaffolding, and bare, trampled, heaped up earth<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Repairs were being made to the walls of the choir to protect them from collapse.</note> which burst on me so unexpectedly, where I had imagined to find the old sacred stillness!&#x2014; Nobody had told me&#x2014;nor had I noticed till inside it, that anything was doing to the old Church, and when a scene so revolting to any interested person presented itself, it was like a stunning blow on the face, taking away for some moments all power of distinguishing whether <hi rend="italic">his</hi> grave was <hi rend="italic">still there</hi>&#x2014;undisturbed!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">That,</hi> and the sorrowful state of things at Sunny Bank made my last visit to the dear old place so painful to me<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Donaldson sisters were increasingly frail.</note>&#x2014;that I left it, privately determined to return no more! A <hi rend="italic">cowardly</hi> determination you will say&#x2014;but the <hi rend="italic">cowardice</hi> must go to the account of my bodily weakness at the time, complicated by the excitement of overfatigue. Now that I am a little stronger, and as calm <hi rend="italic">as I ever am</hi>&#x2014;or expect to be in this aggravating world. I ask myself; would it not be more sensible as well as more courageous, to go back after all, and try to get my last dismal impressions effaced by more cheerful ones, instead of <hi rend="italic">running away</hi> (as it were) by another road, and glooming over the recollection of poor dear Haddington for the rest of my Life!?&#x2014;</p>
<p>A letter from Miss Jess this morning contains better news of her Sister than I have received for many months&#x2014;&#x201C;better nights&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;a little more strength&#x201C;&#x2014;and then Eliza,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their niece Eliza Donaldson.</note> tho&#x2019; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">requiring much attention</hi>&#x201D; does seem to be shaking them out of their sombre &#x201C;all-by-themselves life&#x201C;&#x2014;so quite possibly the recollections I brought away of Miss Donaldson&#x2019;s agonies of restlessness&#x2014;so unlike her old self!&#x2014;and of Miss Jess&#x2019;s lonely overwrought weakness&#x2014;might be better <hi rend="italic">superseded</hi> by the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> phase of Sunny-Bank, than <hi rend="italic">effaced</hi> by Time, at a distance.</p>
<p>But there is also the other question to be answered before I can make up my mind; and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I can only ask of <hi rend="italic">you.</hi> If I went to see his grave <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> would it be for my comfort&#x2014;or for worse distress? I can bear the <hi rend="italic">unfavourable</hi> answer at a distance better than I could bear it on the spot,&#x2014;received from my own eyes.</p>
<p>Please to write soon&#x2014;for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C goes into Annandale the middle or end of next week, and I must have my own programme of travel schemed out, that it may be ready for acting upon the week after&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-35-191" n="35:191"/>I need to be home at Chelsea some days before <hi rend="italic">him.</hi></p>
<p>Nothing can be <hi rend="italic">slower</hi> than the life I have led in Fyfe&#x2014;indeed it has been more the Life of a picketted Sheep, than of a human woman!

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I find there is nothing needing to be done in that Carpetbag affair: my old Bag here &#x201C;will <hi rend="italic">do,</hi> if I can leave it; and if I cannot, I may take it with me, &#x26; some other resource will be found.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Basta</hi> [Enough].</p>
<p>I got home well enough last night; and took no harm in the bronchia depart<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> rather the reverse even: for after a large allowance of tea I found the <pb id="pg-35-192" n="35:192"/>feeling almost gone; and that, after a fair night&#x2019;s sleep, continues still to be the case. The only questionable point was, I found at Burntisland they had &#x201C;shod my Horse <hi rend="italic">all round</hi>&#x201D; (small thanks to them for that!)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were four possible blacksmiths in Burntisland: David Arnot of Shore, Alexander Calley of Lothian St., Andrew Calley of Kirkton, and Thomas Turnbull of High St.</note>&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seemed to mean that the animal was lamed, or w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be! &#x201C;It was one of the <hi rend="italic">fore</hi> shoes that was <hi rend="italic">off,</hi> Sir!&#x201D; said they in ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to my interjections. Any way the fact was there, and not to be changed. Poor Fritz set off at a high canter thro&#x2019; the Streets; went cantering, whenever possible, nearly all the way home:&#x2014;I am in a kind of hope we have <hi rend="italic">missed</hi> the lameness this time? For the rest, I have written to Larkin to provide about his arriving, by Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Steamer, on &#x201C;Friday 16<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x201D; with Charlotte, at St. Kath<hi rend="italic">ne</hi> Dock. Jane will follow almost at the same time; &#x26; I am to be &#x201C;at least a week later in arriving.&#x201D; Such is the arrange<hi rend="italic">t.</hi>&#x2014; I hardly think of going by Spedding&#x2019;s, by Milnes&#x2019;s, by L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Stanleys,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Spedding in Cumberland, Richard Monckton Milnes in Yorkshire, and Lord and Lady Stanley in Cheshire.</note> or doing any kind of visit by the road: Annandale, Scotsbrig chiefly, is to have the rest of my time. Cannot be &#x201C;too quiet,&#x201D; in pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> mood &#x26; circumst<hi rend="italic">ces!</hi></p>
<p>I looked a little for you this morn<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> yet with little <hi rend="italic">hope,</hi> as breakfast went on: however, I still hope we shall see you here before we go. &#x201C;Thursday&#x201D; is the day I have rudely marked for being ready (<hi rend="italic">can</hi> easily be so); of course I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> company;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John replied, <date when="1859-09-05">5 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;I have written to Scotsbrig to say you have fixed to come next Thursday [<date when="1859-09-08">8 Sept.</date>], &#x26; I along with you by the latest train.&#x201D;</note> but it is not worth while to <hi rend="italic">tie</hi> you from going sooner:&#x2014;only if, <hi rend="italic">any</hi> day, you feel to have nothing more to do in Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi>&#x2014;why not step into a Steamer and run over hither for a final 24 hours?&#x2014; I meanwhile ought to be <hi rend="italic">busy!</hi>&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi></salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The day before yesterday, I received your Letter, with its Inclosure,&#x2014;&#xa3;14 half-yearly Dividend,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590224-TC-CBU-01">TC to <sic>CB</sic><corr>CBU</corr>, <date when="1859-02-24">24 Feb.</date></ref></note>&#x2014;date New York 17 Aug<hi rend="italic">t;</hi> punctual as that always is, like the movements of the Zodiac:&#x2014;and can only again thank you for all the kind skill &#x26; trouble you expend on my behalf.

So soon as the Document you talk of (&#x201C;Certificate&#x201D; or whatever the name is) comes to hand, I will lock it well away; and have the pleasure of thinking that human art could do nothing more for me in regard to that particular bit of business,&#x2014;for wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I myself was so little qualified, and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> nevertheless was required at my hands under penalty. The invest<hi rend="italic">t</hi> seems to be as safe as any in this mutable world can be; and clearly enough the rate of interest is as 7 to 4, compared to any I could find, on what were judged sure terms, in this country.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Butler explained, <date when="1859-08-17">17 Aug.</date>, that the &#xa3;1,000 ($4,883.83), together with interest of $84.30 already accrued, was invested in shares (administered jointly by Butler and his brother-in-law, William Butler Ogden [<date when="1805">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877">77</date>]) in the Chicago and North Western Railway Co., which yielded 7 percent interest, payable half-yearly. Butler assured TC that the bonds were secure &#x201C;beyond a reasonable doubt&#x201D; and that interest of $254 would accrue every year on <date when="1859-02-01">1 Feb.</date> and <date when="1859-08-01">1 Aug.</date>. (Kimball 288).</note> You have very much obliged me; and if the consciousness of that can be any recompense, most surely <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is yours, with the wish on my part that I had a better to offer!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have been here, in the Scotch maritime regions (pleasant country, across the Frith from Edinburgh), for above two months past; endeavouring to gather a little strength out of the blessed Summer, instead of being stewed to despair by it in the heats of London. We were both of us, especially my Wife, at a very low ebb before removing hither; and both of us, especially she, have derived some visible profit; and hope to front the Winter on rather better terms. I, alas, have <hi rend="italic">still</hi> my Task mainly ahead of me; and it is horrible to me<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> to think of! But I must do my best &#x26; wisest; and hope to struggle thro&#x2019; by some kind of miracle! In 2 weeks more we are to be in Chelsea; and must try.&#x2014;&#x2014;<closer><salute>with many kind regards &#x26; thanks, I am ever, Yours sincerely</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am glad you resolve to go with me: I shall study to be up to time on Thursday; and hope it will all go smoothly and well. My opinion rather is I ought to get into the rail at Kirkcaldy, there being bulky luggage (two Portmanteaus of good size), and the better road that way. But we shall see.</p>
<p>None of those Paterson-Romanes specimens<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

<p>If Gordon be at home,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Gordon lived at 21 E.

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>I have, as perhaps you in some measure know, been rusticating, and vegetating (latter partly in the <hi rend="italic">aquatic</hi> manner) for these last two months and more, on the pleasant coast of Fife; and now we are all slowly settling homeward,&#x2014;I by the western route, and my native Border Country, the Wife by Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; the Eastern, on like grounds;&#x2014;ought all to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> at Chelsea within a fortnight hence, with the small fruit of our Summer&#x2019;s earning, whatever that may be.</p>
<p>You may well suppose I never forgot y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kind Note, rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> just before leaving home; and am now thinking more decisively of it than ever, now when the time is come for some hope of acting on it, or for honestly renouncing such hope till a new opportunity.</p>
<p>It is certain if there were a human roof under wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I could wish to be a guest in my present mood and circumstances, that roof w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be R<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Milnes&#x2019;s:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fryston Hall, Yorkshire, was the Milnes&#x2019; family home; for TC&#x2019;s <date when="1841">1841</date> visit when Milnes&#x2019;s parents were still alive, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410407-TC-JWC-01"><sic>13:80</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1841-04-07">7 April 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;but, alas, that helps little!

<p>Yet I will expend a little advice on you, by word of mouth, when I come&#x2014;for the sake of having discharged my duty as your friend, rather than for any hope of mending you!</p>
<p>I shall be home next week&#x2014; I cannot specify the day yet&#x2014;but will write again, in the hope of your coming to meet me.

<p>I, for my part, have plenty of writing-paper!&#x2014;of two kinds!&#x2014;but what I have been at a loss for was the least inclination to write! till I should have something to communicate worth the trouble of putting it on paper&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> I have just brought back with me from Granton;&#x2014;I can tell you now the last news of your horse,&#x2014;whom I saw in his box on board <hi rend="italic">The Princess Royal</hi> with his magnificent head-gear on, looking well enough pleased, and (I thought) rather glad to see me, when I gave him my blessing and a parting kiss on the nose! There was another horse, not unlike him, in an adjoining box&#x2014;but without head gear. Old John<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Whyte (b. ca. <date when="1795">1795</date>), Walter Welsh&#x2019;s servant at Auchtertool Manse.</note> was waiting, and I repaid him two shillings he had got from Walter for the crossing, and half a crown for <hi rend="italic">hay,</hi> that had been needed!!&#x2014;and gave him half a crown to himself&#x2014;for his various trouble with us&#x2014;I suppose that was right?&#x2014;</p>
<p>Of course I had Charlotte and Nero on board <hi rend="italic">in excellent time</hi>&#x2014;and saw the luggage safely stowed&#x2014; And now I am back at Morningside excessively <pb id="pg-35-201" n="35:201"/>tired, but with a load off my mind&#x2014; I awoke at <hi rend="italic">four,</hi> for good, as usual, terrified by a dream about seeing old John appear at The Princess Royal, as it was just lifting anchor! <hi rend="italic">with no horse,</hi> but himself dressed in stocking-pantaloons with Hessian boots bearing large tassells!!&#x2014; And when I questioned him; tho his lips seemed to move, I could not <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> a word out of his head!!&#x2014;</p>
<p>There was a dreadful storm of wind and rain for two days after you left&#x2014;(&#x201C;equinoctial gales&#x201D;)  But it mercifully subsided before we had to &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">cross</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;so I got over without any horror of sickness&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>I did at last lift anchor from Fife, a difficult operation for one so lazy and heavy laden; and have been here almost a week, on my way homewards,&#x2014;constantly in view of Skiddaw<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cumbrian mountain, 3054 ft.</note> and you, when rain-clouds and obstructions did not intervene. I am very anxious to come, and have another day or two with you in this world: the spirit indeed is willing, but alas, the flesh is weak!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 26:41.</note> My Brother, one of the most learned men in that particular, has been studying for me in &#x201C;Bradshaw&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Monthly railway and steamer timetable; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560903-TC-IC-01"><sic>31:214</sic><corr>TC to IC, <date when="1856-09-03">3 Sept. 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> but, alas, finds nothing comfortable: a degree of <pb id="pg-35-202" n="35:202"/>gig work, shifting, tumbling and bothering,&#x2014;which the weak soul shudders at in its present mood! The truth is, I am considerably in disrepair of body at this time (untowardly chances, colds, &#x26;c, that befel me in Fife); and in mind almost still more, <hi rend="italic">fractus bello, fractus annis</hi> [crushed by battle, crushed by years],&#x2014;and with that hideous nightmare of a Prussian business pressing constantly on my poor imagination; a nightmare in fact likely to choke the life out of me, I often think! Man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upwards;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 5:7.</note> and seeks out troubles for himself if enough do not find him!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On the whole my practical conclusion is, I ought to wait the fruit of the coming Campaign; and postpone my visit to Mirehouse (as I habitually do all visits and social enjoyments whatever) till my &#x201C;nightmare&#x201D; is hustled off forevermore, or at least till the internecine duel between me and it is <hi rend="italic">completed,</hi>&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> indeed will mean the same thing or nearly so. That once done, how gladly will I come, and with what perfection of childlike loyalty rest myself once and again under your friendly shade!</p>
<p>Please let it be <hi rend="italic">so;</hi> and do not bother yourself writing, &#x26;c., farther of the matter. Wish me well thro&#x2019; my George-and-Dragon duel (not without some quizzical pity), and then&#x2014;!&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Thanks dear Goody;</salute> I was right glad of your Letter this morning, probably you have no guess how glad!</p>
<p>Four in the morning, and dreams of Walter&#x2019;s John in Hessian boots, fallen speechless, with the Steamer starting:&#x2014;alas, it is the bad old story, I see. But you have now got everything handsomely off your little hand; and will surely be able to repose with a little more security.</p>
<p>All was right ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> John &#x26; the Horse;&#x2014;the 2/6, I guess, was for provender <hi rend="italic">on the voyage;</hi>&#x2014;Charlotte and the two quadrupeds are surely getting a fine voyage, and we may wish them all luck of it.</p>
<p>I have had about a hatful of scrubby Notes to write; and there is not a <pb id="pg-35-203" n="35:203"/>minute left me: but I could not let you off to a new Address with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> writing one word, poor little soul. I have got paper too; but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the <hi rend="italic">comfortablest</hi> kind for a steel pen, in case of haste.</p>
<p>On Monday I have to set my Gill Tailor<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom Garthwaite.</note> going, and shall probably be over there for a day or two then;&#x2014;or I can ride over, &#x26; return, same day: &#x201C;Dromedary&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The horse TC had borrowed, summer <date when="1858">1858</date>; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580708-TC-JWC-01"><sic>34:16</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-08">8 July 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note> one of the coarsest of high horses, is one of the willingest, singularly safe in the feet, and I make her &#x201C;plonk&#x201D; about with me, at a speedy rate, many miles every day. Poor little Jenny too is one of the best of <hi rend="italic">missuses</hi> (poor little creature, it is pathetic to see her &#x26; see all of them): her chicken messes are wholesome to me; and I feel <hi rend="italic">better,</hi> surely not worse.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin</salute>
<p>If my character for <hi rend="italic">sobriety</hi> (whatever else) were not &#x201C;above suspicion&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial; as Caesar&#x2019;s wife ought to be; see Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Life of Julius Caesar</hi> sec. 6.</note> these written documents you are receiving from me might give you room to <hi rend="italic">think!</hi></p>
<p>Certainly I was never so confused in all my life! so needing to be myself taken charge of, instead of taking charge of others whether with four legs or two! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C gave me no instructions about that horse beyond ordering it to be sent on board the Princess Royal by my Cousins Groom<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Whyte.</note>&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Anybody</hi> at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> could tell me <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> I wanted to know&#x201D;!&#x2014;and my three maiden aunts, living out at Morningside, are as ignorant about Steamers and Horses and &#x201C;all that sort of things&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> as sucking doves!&#x2014;and I absolutely have not seen a male creature &#x201C;to speak to&#x201D; since I arrived in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>! The night before last, I was so bothered in my mind about having to take Charlotte and the dog to Granton, and meet the horse there, and arrange them all on the ship that I awoke for good at four in the morning&#x2014;frightened by a horrid dream, that my Cousin&#x2019;s respectable old groom had presented himself on the pier at <pb id="pg-35-204" n="35:204"/>Granton in <hi rend="italic">Hessian boots with tassells!</hi> and a cocked hat!!&#x2014;and not the vestige of a horse!! tho&#x2019; the ship was just at the point of sailing&#x2014; Like Hamlet, &#x201C;the time,&#x201D; you see, was &#x201C;out of joint&#x201D; for me, and I was &#x201C;not born to set it right&#x201D;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 1.5.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Nevertheless I found in the waking reality of the case, &#x201C;old John&#x201D; all right&#x2014;looking out for me to show me the horse, quite contentedly looking out of its box in very handsome headgear. I patted his neck, and gave him my blessing, and then paid the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">three pounds</hi>&#x201D; demanded for his passage&#x2014;and thought I had done all that England or M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle,&#x2014;or the horse&#x2019;s self expected of me!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; for Nelson&#x2019;s saying, see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570807-JWC-TC-01"><sic>33:13</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1857-08-07">7 Aug. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; But&#x2014;oh horror!&#x2014;last night&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">in the middle of &#x201C;Prayers&#x201C;</hi>&#x2014;it flashed thro&#x2019; me like a knife, that the three pounds was surely not so much as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had paid coming down&#x2014;and that I should have paid something for <hi rend="italic">food</hi> to the poor horse!&#x2014; Good God! If after all my anxiety and trouble I had <hi rend="italic">left it to be starved!</hi>&#x2014; This idea suggested itself in connection with <hi rend="italic">a-half crown</hi> Old John told me he had &#x201C;paid for hay, and must tell Charlotte about&#x201C;&#x2014; At the moment I never thought but the hay had been got at Auchtertool&#x2014;only <hi rend="italic">during prayers</hi> it struck me, the words &#x201C;Must tell Charlotte about it&#x201D; indicated the hay to have been got on board&#x2014;so then the horse&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">food</hi> could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have been included in the <hi rend="italic">3&#xa3;</hi>&#x2014;and would half a crown&#x2019;s worth of hay be enough for him?&#x2014;if not; would Charlotte have the sense to pay for what else he required? Charlotte <hi rend="italic">between ourselves</hi> has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> improved in <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> during her stay in Scotland&#x2014;&#x201C;anything <hi rend="italic">but</hi>&#x201D;!&#x2014; I gave Charlotte thirteen shillings at parting, the most of which, as she preferred taking <hi rend="italic">her provisions</hi> with her&#x2014;(those of the ship being bad she said) I meant her to use at Cheyne Row&#x2014; I did not wish her to have more money about her than was <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> for she is both very wasteful and very careless of money, her own&#x2014;and other peoples&#x2014;then besides, of her <hi rend="italic">own</hi> money she must have had, after all her purchases in Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> the best part of half a Sovereign left&#x2014;so surely, surely she would spend what was needed on the poor horse!

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley,</salute>
<p>After a long spell of quiet rustication on the shores of Fife (sea-bathing, horse-riding, ass-riding, and in general entire idleness, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> one hopes has been of advantage), we are now on our way, on our respective ways, homewards to Chelsea again,&#x2014;my Wife by Edinburgh and the Eastern Road, at the north end of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she has still some old friends; I by this Western Route, where, as you know, my native country is; always an impressive scene, full of mournful but more or less blessed influences to a thinking human creature in this world. I have been here about a week; and in some eight or ten days more, must lift anchor again and float southwards, to my dreary operations there: Wife (evidently rather improved, I hope) is to be home about a week before me;&#x2014;to her Alderley and your beneficent proposal in regard to it is forbidden fruit for this time.</p>
<p>As to me I have been looking into the Railway Books, or getting them looked into; and find, in spite of my lazy dispirited humour, that &#x201C;it might be done,&#x201C;&#x2014;does not transcend the capabilities of human energy, as <hi rend="italic">all</hi> visits &#x26;c proposed to me have hitherto done on this occasion;&#x2014;and that undoubtedly it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very pleasant to rest two days with you at Alderley before going down to the mud demons again. If L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Stanley is at home, if &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;&#x2014; In fact, pray write to me, within a week hence, two practical words on the matter, if you will be so beneficent; and I will answer upon it Yes or No.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Being hard on Post-time, I must restrict myself to the essential; and so remain for this present, as always</salute></closer></p>

<dateline>Sunny Bank / Haddington [<date when="1859-09-18">18<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Sep<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1859</date>]</dateline>
<p>Oh my Lady! I look with dismay at the date of your note; 11<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Sep<hi rend="italic">r!</hi> and this the 18<hi rend="italic">th!</hi>&#x2014; But indeed it is no fault of mine that I am so long of answering; your note, after a dreary call at Cheyne Row, was sent on a foolish little excursion thro&#x2019; Fife which I had just left, and finally reached me in Edinburgh, <pb id="pg-35-207" n="35:207"/>only the day before yesterday, in the &#x2018;supreme moment&#x2019; of waiting for a cab to take me to the Railway. I was going to visit some Scotch Cousins near Tranent,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Binnie and Mary Godby at Prestonpans, &#xBD; mi. from Tranent.</note> for twenty four hours&#x2014;and they led me such a life, kissing at me and asking me questions, that I could get no single moment, &#x201C;all to myself&#x201D; to write. Yesterday, instead of consigning me to <hi rend="italic">The Train,</hi> as was my wish; they <hi rend="italic">would</hi> send me on to Haddington, my next stage <hi rend="italic">on the road home,</hi> in an open carriage. Of course I arrived with &#x201C;a chill,&#x201D; and had to be instantly made partially-drunk with brandy-punch, and put to bed! So this is positively the first available minute I have had for acknowledging your kind invitation.</p>
<p>And by this time you will have heard from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, I believe, to the effect that we have parted company (not an hour too soon I should say, for the sanity of both!) and that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would go home by Alderley, without incumberance (the wretch!) and, to do him justice, without any interested views on the three new-calved cows, of whose interesting situation he was still unconscious.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Sandwich had written to JWC, <date when="1859-09-11">11 Sept.</date>, warmly urging her to come and visit; she asked JWC to tell &#x201C;the Philosopher 3 cows have just calved &#x26; he shall have all their cream.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>I was very sorry to give up <hi rend="italic">my</hi> share in the prospect of Alderley. But there were pressing reasons why I should not accompany <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to Dumfrieshire and why I should be home at Chelsea before him; reasons &#x201C;which it may be interesting <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to state.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:209</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal <date when="1855-10-31">31 Oct. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I should feel obliged to you if you will insinuate to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s mind when you see him, that <hi rend="italic">taking health by the throat,</hi> as it were, never comes to a good end! that dividing one&#x2019;s time in the country betwixt galloping like the wild Huntsman, and walking in seven league boots, makes the country no healthier than the Town for one! that is, when One happens to be turned sixty and not sixteen! Any thing like the follies that wise man committed at Humbie (the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">horrid hole</hi>&#x201D; as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> well called it, in the spirit of prophecy.) Any thing like his excesses in bathing, and riding and walking, and what he called &#x201C;soft food,&#x201D; I never <hi rend="italic">assisted</hi> at, even in a bad dream!</p>
<p>As for me; I passed my time much like a picketted sheep! pottering about within a circle of one mile, on the most despicable of donkies! which finally flopped over on its side one day, as if its legs had been shot off; plashing me on the highway, and itself accross me; thereby bruising three of my toes, and disgusting me with that &#x201C;species of quadruped for the rest of my life!</p>
<p>But in spite of the mortal ennui of such an existence, complicated with what Mazzini calls &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cares of bread</hi>&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580625-JWC-TC-01"><sic>33:252</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-06-25">25 June 1858</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> (housekeeping) &#x201C;under difficulties&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520723-JWC-TC-01"><sic>27:179</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1852-07-23">23</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-07-24">24 July 1852</date>]</corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;every thing to be brought such a distance, and nobody to bring it!&#x2014;and the worries incident on genius, dieting itself on &#x201C;soft food,&#x201D; and bathing <pb id="pg-35-208" n="35:208"/>and walking and galloping itself into bilious fever!&#x2014;in spite of all that I am stronger a little, in body, and much less nervous than when I took leave of you in London</p>
<p>It is reported that Miss Stewart Mackenzie (I never <hi rend="italic">can</hi> call her <hi rend="italic">Lady Ashburton</hi>) is in a touching situation!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC wrote to Lady Airlie, <ref target="volume-36/lt-18591128-JWC-LAI-01">[<date when="1859-11-28">28 Nov.</date> or <date when="1859-12-05">5 Dec.</date>]</ref><sic>(see vol. 36)</sic>, that Lady Ashburton had miscarried twice but was again pregnant; this was to be her only child, Mary Florence, b. <date when="1860-06-26">26 June 1860</date>.</note> What bliss for my Lord!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Stanley reported to Lady Stanley from Glen Quoich, <date when="1859-08-28">28 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Ashburton made a most absurd speech &#x26; seems more devoted to &#x26; less in awe of his present lady than of the past.

<p>There! I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> done it!&#x2014; You prophecied my heart would fail me when it came to the point, and I would &#x201C;just rush straight on again to the end.&#x201D; But my heart didn&#x2019;t fail me&#x2014;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">or rather</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;(to speak like D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle) it <hi rend="italic">did</hi> fail me horribly!&#x2014;but my <hi rend="italic">memory</hi> held true and kept me up to the mark. With the recollection of the <hi rend="italic">agonies</hi> of tiredness I suffered on the journey down,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590626-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <sic><date when="1859-06-27">27 June</date></sic><corr>[<date when="1859-06-26">26 June</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> and for many days after, still tingling thro&#x2019; my nerves; I took no counsel with my <hi rend="italic">heart,</hi> but kept determined to <hi rend="italic">not</hi> expose myself to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> again whatever else (bugs inclusive)</p>
<p>And so far I have reason to congratulate myself&#x2014;for I was getting &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">quite</hi>&#x201D; done up by the time we reached York&#x2014; And am now very comfortable in my Inn, with prospects for the night not bad! If only there be no &#x201C;small beings&#x201D; (as Mazzini prettily styles them) in the elegant green-curtained bed of Number 44!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Scawins</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am sitting, writing in that number, by the side of a bright little fire which I ordered to be lighted the first thing on my arrival. While it was burning up; I went down and had tea in the &#x201C;Ladies Coffee Room&#x201D; where was no fire, but also no Ladies!&#x2014; They brought me very nice tea and muffins, and I &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">asked for</hi>&#x201D; cream!! and for an <hi rend="italic">egg!!!</hi> &#x201C;and it was all very <hi rend="italic">comfortable!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; I think I shall order some supper when the time comes; but I haven&#x2019;t been able to decide <hi rend="italic">what</hi> yet! There isn&#x2019;t a sound in the house, nor in the back court that my windows look out on!&#x2014; It is hardly to be hoped such quiet can last!&#x2014;Trains will come in during the night, and I shall hear <hi rend="italic">them</hi> anyhow&#x2014; For this Hotel, tho&#x2019; not the <hi rend="italic">Railway Station Hotel,</hi> is just outside the Station Gate. It was Eliza Liddell who recommended it to me&#x2014;</p>

<dateline>The Gill, Friday <date when="1859-09-23">23 Sept<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> 1859</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p>Oh my poor little Goody, what news is this: whirling away towards London in these very hours; likely to arrive (under <hi rend="italic">what</hi> auspices!) by the time this leaves me! The date &#x201C;York&#x201D; gave me a kind of shock, tho&#x2019; not a painful one, for I too am now willing that this affair sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> end. But I did not calculate what a sharp despatching little Goody it was; I had been eagerly expecting tidings, to ground my own calculations on, were it nothing more; and I did not look for so complete a settlement with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> more words wasted. If I only know how you <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> last night! There is quite an idyllic picture of a poor little Goody honourably &#x201C;taking her ease at her inn&#x201C;: altogether pleasant, were it not for that dark prophetic shadow, too prophetic for my imagination at present. At the very best and lowest you will be &#x201C;very tirde,&#x201D; as poor Charlotte spells it. And the unblessed fit of &#x201C;cold shivers,&#x201D; hardly staved off by questionable methods: I am full of anxiety; I beg and again beg one word, the instant this comes to hand;&#x2014;direct to Scotsbrig; it will find me there on Sunday as soon as I like to <hi rend="italic">send:</hi> waiting till Tuesday will be intolerable.&#x2014; And one thing more, <hi rend="italic">don&#x2019;t</hi> flurry and bother about sorting the house &#x26;c; let all that, I entreat thee, <hi rend="italic">lie</hi> as it likes to fall by gravitation; and do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> too only lie, wrapt up, eyes at least <hi rend="italic">shut</hi> (that is truly something, if you try it), and get by every method the completest <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> achievable. For me there is <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> wanted when I come, except to find you unhurt: my <hi rend="italic">bed,</hi> I doubt not, stands in the old place, and all else comes of its own accord.</p>
<p>I rode over hither, in a pensive not unlucky manner, on Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> after <pb id="pg-35-214" n="35:214"/>writing to you: I found the warmest welcome, and the quiest<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; for &#x201C;quietest.&#x201D;</note> lodging in the world (nowhere such a bed since I quitted my own); tailors all successfully at work; and a mild blessed sun, emblem of serene old age illuminating an old scene never scarce of meanings to me when I see it again. I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have been supremely well off, it seemed to me, but there has been a rattle of talk and noise of <hi rend="italic">mind</hi> about me,&#x2014;Jean<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken.</note> here since the Tuesday Ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> goes this night; Jack<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle.</note> here, full of hurries as usual,&#x2014;in short except after midnight and till nine next morning, little absolute composure to be had. I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> except 2 daily hours of riding also; poor awkward Dromedary proving very loyal in her way, nay I do think rather <hi rend="italic">friendly,</hi> and tearing along at a swift rough rate with me thro&#x2019; various old routes mutually known,&#x2014;requiring <hi rend="italic">no</hi> reward poor awkward quadruped except the liberty to drink (perhaps about a six gallons or so from the &#x201C;Doctor&#x2019;s Trough,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a family name (from John&#x2019;s nickname &#x201C;the Doctor&#x201D;) for a well near The Gill.</note> one of the purest wells in Nature) when our ride is nearly done.&#x2014; On the whole I am a good deal better; have not been so well as today for weeks past; tho&#x2019; I know there is still much bile abroad, and I will not brag.&#x2014; My clothes are all successfully <hi rend="italic">done,</hi> 30 hours ago (except a <hi rend="italic">clutch</hi> I am anew making at &#x201C;3 pairs of drawers&#x201D;): on Sunday, as above said, I shall be over at Scotsbrig,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> to be my headquarters henceforth, tho&#x2019; I must come over hitherward once again: &#x201C;about Wednesday or so&#x201D; I think of setting out,&#x2014;&#x201C;about Wednesday,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">if</hi> I go by Alderley, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is still hanging loose, tho&#x2019; I rather <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">subdue</hi> my scunnerings&#x201C;: in fine, I design to be at <hi rend="italic">home</hi> by the end of the next week; that is according to bargain, and will suit in all respects. Mary is right well pleased with her Picture: they one and all send (mutely) a thousand regards to you. One word to Scotsbrig now&#x2014;and so may all be well! <name>T. C.</name></p>

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley,</salute>
<p>I am still hovering in these parts,&#x2014;my Wife, I hope, getting into Chelsea, from York, this very afternoon;&#x2014;and intend to rush home-wards (journey to be swallowed like a dose of physic) within the next 7 days.</p>

<p>All right&#x2014; I arrived soon after five last evening; having lost neither my head nor my luggage&#x2014; But my <hi rend="italic">tiredness!</hi> Heaven knows what it would have been had I come all the way at once! For each half of the journey was as much as I could bear!</p>
<p>I got little sleep at York but no shame to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Scawen<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Scawin.</note> For my bed proved most comfortable, not a &#x201C;small Being&#x201D; molested me of any sort&#x2014; And the quietness was wonderful!&#x2014; Except that several times during the night the Railway whistle seemed to <hi rend="italic">fill my room;</hi> there wasn&#x2019;t a sound!&#x2014; It was merely the tumult of my own blood that kept me waking.</p>
<p>On the whole this first experience of an Inn has been most encouraging&#x2014;for I had every comfort and the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">chaarge</hi>&#x201D; was moderate&#x2014; I had tea with plenty of <hi rend="italic">cream,</hi> muffins and eggs; a tumbler of white wine negus and toast for supper; a breakfast quite sumptuous; whole roast fowl (cold) a tongue, eggs &#x26;c&#x2014; I had as many coals in my bedroom as kept the fire in all night, a pair of candles that I burnt down&#x2014;and for all this, with beautiful rooms and a well aired bugless bed, I was <hi rend="italic">cha-arged</hi> just 9/ and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi></p>

<p><salute>Dear Brother,</salute>&#x2014;If this reach you in time, will you (with Jean to counsel) buy me the best <hi rend="italic">railway rug</hi> you can find in Dumfries;&#x2014;I quite forgot it yesterday, and find now I may stand in need of such a thing on my journey home. I care not what colour (&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">like your own,</hi>&#x201D; will do very well every way for the rug, colour &#x201C;darker&#x201D; no objection); only let it be of good quality and size; and it will be a useful supplement to the one I have at home, in time coming.</p>
<p>[I got well home yesterday; and Mary<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Austin.</note> was wait]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the beginning of the sentence to &#x201C;wait&#x201D; has been cut out (presumably for the signature which would have been on the reverse) and the words inserted in an unknown hand.</note>ing for me with a respectable <pb id="pg-35-217" n="35:217"/>spring-cart, and tea ready on our arrival: but, alas, I found I had caught a noticeable lot of <hi rend="italic">cold;</hi> and thro&#x2019; the night I had a good deal to do with it, tho&#x2019; by good care and luck I have got it well brought under, and happily it is mostly all in the nose and tonsils as yet, nothing of it in the larynx where I like it worst.</p>
<p>The morning was so <hi rend="italic">delugy,</hi> I could not think of Scotsbrig at all; and even yet, when the wind is up and the sky clear, I hesitate about setting out,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; now as good as resolved <hi rend="italic">to</hi> go.

<p>What a wise woman I was to come home by myself, and get my fatigues done out before you arrived!</p>

<dateline>Scotsbrig, Monday <date when="1859-09-26">26 Sept<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> 1859</date></dateline>
<p>Alas, my poor Goody, here are Two Nights successively without sleep: whole journey done with no rest but of the vigilant sort, and henbane itself failing when you get to your own bed! I did not see till the very last line of your Note yesterday how bad it was; for you have the art of turning out the pleasant side of everything when the pen is in your hand. I do hope the next bulletin (there is still just room for another) will tell me a better tale about your sleep.&#x2014; In addition to what I formerly said, there is this farther to be attended to: That you get into a neat fly, and get two drives weekly,&#x2014;one of them with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the least delay on receipt of this. Now mind; for this is strict! It cannot fail to <hi rend="italic">help</hi> you towards sleep; and, with even partial success that way, it will be cheap to both of us.</p>
<p>You may fancy I was right glad to find your Note ready at Ecclefechan yesterday: for I got it myself,&#x2014;in the interval of rain-deluges and other confusions;&#x2014;I had been detained at The Gill <hi rend="italic">till</hi> Sunday morning (chiefly Jean and the Doctor&#x2019;s and other extraneous movements to blame for it); and that morning, on going out, my mackintosh Cape was as cataract all the time I walked. Kind of cold upon me, too, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I had caught, but was subduing (&#x26; have now subdued). Mary earnestly proposed three times over to <hi rend="italic">send</hi> one of the lasses<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Austins had eight das.</note> to Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> for my Letter: but I appointed 2 p.m. for decision of the weather; and by that time there had risen a hurricane of s.w. wind; in the middle of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I pensively <hi rend="italic">flatched</hi> up, at a swiftish pace, on the loyal back of Dromedary, wind mostly behind me, &#x26; lullabying my poor soul into a gloomy kind of peace. At length came the Ecclefechan Kirkyard Tree and the still Mansions<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., graves.</note> round it,&#x2014;and my poor Goody&#x2019;s Letter waiting for me still among <pb id="pg-35-219" n="35:219"/>the living. It I read on horseback; the other stuff safe shoved into my pocket. Jamie and the Boys with good assiduous little Jenny were here to wait on me: I kept quiet, was <hi rend="italic">judicious</hi> in the diet way, and the remains of cold (gathered by a foolish run to Dumfries, in <hi rend="italic">non</hi>-resistance to my circumstances at The Gill, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> were thoroughly resistable had I taken tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi>) are now gone, as I said. There is something very nice to me in the unaffected human heartiness of welcome, and real effectuality of help, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I get in these two rustic habitations peculiar to me in this Planet.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; Jack has been at Arbuckle&#x2019;s, at Dumfries, out on a miscellaneous foray for an 8 days past; comes hither tonight again;&#x2014;well disposed as can be poor soul, but rather the <hi rend="italic">enemy</hi> of quiet than the friend. He knows <hi rend="italic">Bradshaw</hi> better than any human soul of his day:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Most of John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s letters to TC, summer <date when="1859">1859</date>, contained extensive timetable information, whether for railways or steamers.</note> I will get that, among my other helps from him; and settle definitely about my hours and times in the course of tomorrow.</p>
<p>He asserts loudly I ought to start from The Gill (less waiting in Carlisle by that method, indeed almost none); for quiet&#x2019;s sake were there no other reason I shall probably comply. Then there is the Stanley matter to be settled, Yes or No; that too I mean to do tomorrow. On Wednesday I will write to you (in ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to the Note you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to send;&#x2014;don&#x2019;t forget it!) what my Program is. Later than Saturday I in no case intend to be. Thursday (ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>11&#xBD; a.m. from The Gill, or 10 if from Scotsbrig) is my likeliest time of starting. Get you y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> brougham, little Goodykin &#x26; wait patiently. The Horse shall have a little exercise before long!&#x2014;</p>

He wrote again, <date when="1859-09-21">21 Sept.</date>, that a word from TC would carry great weight with the outgoing principal, Sir David Brewster (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868">1868</date>; <ref target="volume-35/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3371"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), with James Frederick Ferrier (<date when="1808">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864">64</date>; <ref target="volume-35/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9369"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), prof. of ethics and moral philosophy, and with William Spalding (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">59</date>; <ref target="volume-35/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26080"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), prof. of logic, rhetoric, and metaphysics.

Of course the Stanley vehicle was gone, two hours before I could alight; I think it must have been towards 9 before I could get set down here. Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was a great blow, taken all together!

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Friday at Alderley&#x2014;when I wrote, was a day that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have done honour to Annandale at its wettest: steady rain, and the appearance of nothing but rain past &#x26; future, all Nature in a slush. Nevertheless &#x201C;Liulph&#x201D; the young Stanley<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Lyulph Stanley.</note> and I decided to &#x201C;go out&#x201D;; and did so, at a swift pace, galloping till we reached the dripping wood-avenues, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> were all <hi rend="italic">calm</hi> at heart our ride continued 2 hours and more, on rapid terms, hat &#x26; mackintosh running like Niagara; but nothing getting <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> except the legs:&#x2014;this muddy plunge outward did me a great deal of good; and I had a much better night than the preceding one. Saturday was <hi rend="italic">damp</hi> but not rainy; evidently getting drier as we drove to the Station (only 2&#xBD; miles off, instead of &#x201C;5&#x201D; as I had guessed it); train came up after 5 or 10 minutes, I got a carriage mostly to myself the whole way, altogether so except for a while in the middle (an old lady from Crewe to Leamington, and for a <hi rend="italic">short</hi> stage 2 other females ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Walsall or Wolverhampton);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Crewe to Leamington Spa, ca. 64 mi.; Crewe to Walsall in Wolverhampton, ca. 38 mi.; Crewe to London, ca. 160 mi.</note> after that, I even <hi rend="italic">smoked.</hi> In short no train c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be better; and I did very well throughout (some bread &#x26; <hi rend="italic">snaps</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably ginger or sugar snaps; cf. <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430312-JWC-JW-01"><sic>16:79</sic><corr>JWC to JW, [<date when="1843-03-12">12 March 1843</date>]</corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540103-TC-LA-01"><sic>29:2</sic><corr>TC to LA, <date when="1854-01-03">3 Jan. 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note> from Mary, very useful, my <hi rend="italic">drink</hi> unluckily run out); and landed here at <place>Chelsea</place>, safe tho&#x2019; very much confused, at 6 p.m. the predicted hour, or before it,&#x2014;right glad to have the ugly job behind me. Jane was fully as well as I expected; has since <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> fairly for these two nights;&#x2014;and complains of nothing except an accident to Nero which [be]fel [the]<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS damaged.</note> other day. Poor Nero, a Butcher&#x2019;s Cart, at some sudden turn, ran over him,&#x2014;over his <hi rend="italic">neck,</hi> I find it was; so that the thick <hi rend="italic">muscles</hi> saved him, and tho&#x2019; still &#x201C;confined&#x201D; or mostly so, he <hi rend="italic">eats</hi> &#x26; bids fair to be round again before long.</p>
<p>We have beautiful bright weather; really too <hi rend="italic">hot,</hi> I found it yesterday, while riding with <hi rend="italic">open</hi> coat, &#x26; today I have had to lay aside my dressing gown for a jacket, up here in the garret.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>At length I reach home, two days ago, after a longer absence than I almost ever made before: I find your little <hi rend="italic">Ms. Volume</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Dutch Tour in <date when="1736">1736</date>&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18591008-TC-SGSOUC-01">TC to <sic>[GS or UC]</sic><corr>[SGSOUC]</corr>, <date when="1859-10-08">8 Oct.</date></ref></note> lying safe on my table, as I had reason to expect; and surely I am much obliged by your goodness to me, by your [p]atience with me! It is shameful that I did not answer your successive Letters sooner which indeed were very welcome to me, in spite of such treatment! But perhaps there are excuses too, if you knew my fluctuating totally idle and waste course of life while rusticating in those old scenes. I avoided all speech that was not inevitable; had no companion but my Horse; and maintained no dialogue except the sombre inarticulate unfathomable one with those old rocks and seas. We came no farther Northward than Fife; paid no visits wh[ile] on the road to or from. I hope we may have gathered, both of us, a little strength; but it is no great matter,&#x2014;far too little for the steep hill that now lies close ahead again.</p>
<p>It does not appear to me hitherto that the History of Fred<hi rend="italic">k can</hi> be written; that I, or any mortal, can make a <hi rend="italic">human</hi> Book of it to Englishmen of this day. So <hi rend="italic">in</hi>human has <hi rend="italic">it</hi> grown, under the continual manipulation of stupid men; so inhuman (in another kind) have <hi rend="italic">they</hi> grown under d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>! If one cannot write it, one can let it lie unwritten? That will be a sorry condition too. On the whole, one must do one&#x2019;s very utmost bad-best,&#x2014;&#x26; had better, for this reason, hold one&#x2019;s peace in the interim.</p>
<p>If I ever live to get thro&#x2019; this Book, I mean to see all my Friends once more, with a great deal of composure; and not to undertake any work farther for the <pb id="pg-35-225" n="35:225"/>rest of my time in this world.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014; Meanwhile I will at any rate look into this <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> Volume by my earliest leisure; and safely return it so soon as finished. <closer><salute>With many thanks &#x26; regards</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have been in Scotland, this long while; above 3 months in all, the last 3 weeks of it in Annandale;&#x2014;and have often been thinking to write you a long Letter out of those old scenes, where at every turn the deep remembrance of you rose so fresh in me. I came home about a week ago; I find, in the confused weak state I have been in, my resolution of writing to you not yet fulfilled: but I set about fulfilling it <hi rend="italic">before</hi> attempting any kind of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> here;&#x2014;regular <hi rend="italic">work</hi> is to begin again on Monday; and on this Friday I will write my good Alick&#x2019;s Letter, and have the comfort of despatching it. While I continue in this world <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is one I can never forget, or cease to be thankful for!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Last year was not a propitious one to me: I returned, rather before this day of the month, out of Germany, as I think I then told you;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had written to AC, <date when="1858-10-15">15 Oct. 1858</date> (see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581015-TC-AC-01"><sic>34:218</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1858-10-15">15 Oct. 1858</date></corr></ref>), but did not mention the trip to Germany from which he had returned <date when="1858-09-22">22 Sept. 1858</date>.</note> and in a few days farther I started the attempt to finish my miserable big Task, as it were by sheer force, and violently <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> my way to the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of it. Alas, the attempt had no success with me. The attempt was itself an unwise one, <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not well have succeeded in any case: moreover, I had got myself so smashed to pieces with that <hi rend="italic">sleepless</hi> German Tour (the effects of which I still feel) that I was quite below par in health:&#x2014;in short, I prospered worse and worse all thro&#x2019; winter &#x26; spring, and made no real way at all; only in my obstinate persistence, like a man trying to <hi rend="italic">dig</hi> tho&#x2019; up to the neck in <hi rend="italic">mud,</hi> grew stupider &#x26; stupider! Jane too was very weak; &#x26; in May, got into the worst fit of illness I ever saw her have,&#x2014;kind of <pb id="pg-35-227" n="35:227"/><hi rend="italic">cold</hi> caught then, in the burst of wild weather we had; but <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> attended with such spasmodic pains, and such a degree of utter weakness as were alarming to behold. A Doctor<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Alfred Brooke Barnes.</note> of the neighbourhood, who forced her to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> a little, did her a great deal of good: that, I think, was his chief medicine, that of <hi rend="italic">eating;</hi> on which followed <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> and other good things. Finding herself a little reinstated tho&#x2019; in such a state of feebleness, and seeing me so <hi rend="italic">bemired</hi> and farspent, she recommended &#x201C;a long flight to solitude and the sea-shore&#x201C;: so after much haggling we did take flight in the end of june,&#x2014;to the shore of Fife (place called <hi rend="italic">Aberdour,</hi> about 4 miles west of Burntisland, if you recollect those localities);&#x2014;and there for the first 6 weeks, lodging in a rough Farmhouse (upper story of it ours, and a maid with us), and after that for 5 weeks more in &#x201C;Auchtertool House,&#x201D; a big vacant Mansion, all to ourselves, about 3 miles inland, we did our best to be dietetic, quiet, <hi rend="italic">idle,</hi> and to get good of Fife. The finish was, I went to Annandale; Jane, soon after, into East-Lothian for a while, whence home to Chelsea by the East road (Maid, <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi> &#x26;c preceding her by Edinburgh-London Steamer), I following, about a week after, by the <hi rend="italic">western</hi> rail-courses,&#x2014;namely starting from <hi rend="italic">Cummertrees.</hi> Nearly a week ago I too got home; and it was all over. We had an immense quantity of <hi rend="italic">fash,</hi> of expense &#x26;c &#x26;c; whether benefit in proportion may well be questioned: but I do hope we are both a little better; and <hi rend="italic">a little</hi> must be reckoned precious in the circumstances we have now arrived at. Jack was in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> most of the time (living in Lodgings there, poor soul,&#x2014;very lively still), and was often coming across to us; always prompt to <hi rend="italic">help</hi> in every way he could. For the rest, I studied to have no company, or as little as possible; Fife was grown <hi rend="italic">old</hi> and tragic to me; I passed my time, riding about, walking, diligently bathing, generally in a sombre silent mood. One day in Kirkcaldy I rode up the <hi rend="italic">Kirk Wynd,</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Alexander Carlyle attended his brother&#x2019;s school for a term or two and lodged with him at Mrs. Skene&#x2019;s in the street called Kirkwind&#x201D; (A. Carlyle note in <hi rend="italic">NL</hi> 202).</note> saw the old room where we two lodged together long ago,&#x2014;the staircase window &#x26;c seemed all <hi rend="italic">younger</hi> rather than otherwise, in their bright new colourings by lime and paint, but the Two Lodgers had not been growing younger the while! Kirkaldy is still a flourishing place; and Peter Swan (whom you may remember as a little black-eyed boy), now an old bachelor, inclined to corpulency, is the chief man of the place. All new paved, old <hi rend="italic">Jail</hi> quite swept away; screaming with railways &#x26;c &#x26;c: a place I had no pleasure in re-surveying.</p>
<p>Down in Annandale, at Scotsbrig, I again met Jack: in Scotsbrig you know what sad change had occured in the first days of June; poor Isabella carried to her last home, after long years of sickliness and sufferings, the last months and weeks of which had been tragically severe! Her complaint was of the liver and bowels; you may fancy all the rest: Jamie &#x26; the two Boys were her nurses; <pb id="pg-35-228" n="35:228"/>she kept her composure, and was singularly quiet, clear &#x26; steady to the very last day.&#x2014; Jamie seemed to me to be silently very sad, tho&#x2019; he makes no open lamenting: poor little Jenny (not yet quite 17) has to act as mistress,&#x2014;and, for one so young, she seemed to do it admirably well. Jamie hopes, her love of <hi rend="italic">him</hi> being great, that she will be abler for her post as she grows older, and stand faithfully to it with increasing sense. Poor Jamie: we went to the Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Kirkyard together, one day, and spent a few silent minutes, which could not be other than solumn.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> There they all lay, so still and dumb those that were once so blithe and quick at sight of us; gathered to their sleep under the long grass:&#x2014;I could not forbear a kind of sob, like a child&#x2019;s, out of my old worn heart, at first sight of all this. A high wall now surrounds the Kirkyard, no entrance till you get the key: Jamie has on hand a bit of low masonwork &#x26; railing to be put round our portion of the place, about which he had consulted me before: it will probably be finished this month or next.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the family gravestone with the railing surround, see 229. James and Isabella had a gravestone &#x201C;In memory of Thomas Carlyle, son of James Carlyle and Isabella Calvert, in Scotsbrig, who died 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> <date when="1841">1841</date>, aged 3 years and one month&#x201D;; Isabella was added to this gravestone, and then James, &#x201C;who died at Pingle, 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> <date when="1890-05-00">May 1890</date>, aged 84 years.&#x201D;</note> <figure><graphic url="volume-35-229-18.gif"/><p>Carlyle family gravestone, Ecclefechan</p><p><hi rend="italic">From a photograph by K. J. Fielding</hi></p></figure></p>
  <p>The old &#x201C;Kirkyard Tree&#x201D; is nearly all blown away, at least &#x2154; of it gone within the last 5 or 6 years;&#x2014;and there is a great yellow <hi rend="italic">fungus,</hi> or mushroom (large as a <hi rend="italic">cow&#x2019;s liver,</hi> visible off the road), growing in a cleft of the stem of it.</p>
<p>Jamie, I believe, is doing well enough in his farming operations,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; this Year was not so favourable as others; &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">driest</hi> year since <date when="1826">1826</date>&#x201D;; all the turnips wasted into fingers-and-toes; crop short, and never such a dearth of hay.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries and Galloway Courier</hi> reported, <date when="1859-08-16">16 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;[Harvest had] commenced as early as the week before last, an earliness unknown in this climate since the year <date when="1826">1826</date>. Stooks are generally miserably small, and stacks few in number. &#x2026; [T]he grain crop, save winter wheat, is one third below an average.&#x201D;</note> But farming is still a good trade there, in comparison with what you once knew it; and Jamie seems very <hi rend="italic">gleg,</hi> to fit himself to the new circumstances that are changing so many things. <hi rend="italic">Crop</hi> farming is almost out; grazing, stall-feeding, for Liverpool and the railways, that is now the method. Jamie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Boys are at home: the elder of them (Jamie jun<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> a nice rational kind of <hi rend="italic">dandyish</hi> figure) has left Glasgow, on the score of <hi rend="italic">health,</hi> and also I think of <hi rend="italic">dislike;</hi> and does not at all know what he will go into next.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC told Alexander, <date when="1860-04-13">13 April 1860</date>: &#x201C;Jamie at Scotsbrig has his eldest son now at home &#x2026; who talks of going to Australia&#x201D; (Marrs 737).</note></p>
<p>At the Gill, Mary &#x26; her Husband &#x26; House hold were all brisk &#x26; busy; building new Offices &#x26;c. They have got a new Lease,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590107-TC-JCHA-01">TC to <sic>JCH</sic><corr>JCHA</corr>, <date when="1859-01-07">7 Jan.</date></ref></note> as you doubtless heard; I think, some &#xa3;20 <hi rend="italic">more</hi> of rent yearly,&#x2014;they still hope to do, in the improved times, tho&#x2019; the place is fairly dear. Mary is much worn in appearance, but I <pb id="pg-35-229" n="35:229"/><pb id="pg-35-230" n="35:230"/>judge her to be in stouter <hi rend="italic">health</hi> than in former years, and still full of activity and energy (the whole management lying on <hi rend="italic">her</hi> mainly, as some of them say). Austin is but little changed: a quiet, laborious man; many worse for one there is better.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have looked over your little <hi rend="italic">ms.</hi> of a Dutch Tour in <date when="1736">1736</date> by your worthy Grandfather;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sinclair&#x2019;s paternal grandfather was George Sinclair (d. <date when="1776">1776</date>) of Ulbster, Caithness; his maternal grandfather was Alexander MacDonald (d. <date when="1795">1795</date>) of Slate, Co. Antrim. Neither is traced as having taken a &#x201C;Dutch Tour of <date when="1736">1736</date>&#x201D;; it was possibly written by a relative rather than one of the grandfathers.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> having now finished, I make haste to return it to you, after <pb id="pg-35-231" n="35:231"/>such delays. It goes today, by Book post; <hi rend="italic">along</hi> with the present <hi rend="italic">Note,</hi> unless the Post-Office people use their liberty of detaining it till Monday morning in case of need.</p>
<p>It is a very pleasant, transparently vivacious, cheerful and intelligent bit of Narrative;&#x2014;I imagined myself to discover a certain <hi rend="italic">family likeness</hi> in the Piece; and could have read the whole of it with real entertainment, had it been in <hi rend="italic">print.</hi> But the ink is fallen <hi rend="italic">brown,</hi> and the hand is occasionally somewhat vague.</p>
<p>It seems to me any respectable magazine w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be happy to print such a thing well edited by <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> and perhaps filial piety ought sometime or other to set you on that mode of preserving the innocent interesting little Document?&#x2014;</p>
<p>As it belongs wholly to <date when="1736">1736</date>, there is nothing in it that can now be of service to me but I did not fail to note, with private satisfaction, what the veridical Tourist says about Wesel, Cleve, and Fr<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Wilhelm&#x2019;s matters;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wesel, town on the Rhine in the Duchy of Cleve, was claimed by Friedrich Wilhelm; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:407&#x2013;8 and 13:158.</note> and it was a curious pleasure to me to <hi rend="italic">see,</hi> as it were with eyes, the &#x201C;Effigy of Lieut<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Keith&#x201D; still on the Gallows<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For his part in Frederick&#x2019;s attempted escape to England (see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580115-TC-HL-01"><sic>33:152</sic><corr>TC to HL, <date when="1858-01-15">15 Jan. 1858</date></corr></ref>), Lt. Keith was &#x201C;hanged in effigy, cut in four quarters, and nailed to the gallows&#x201D;; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:338.</note> at the former place! Visible enough there to your grandfather and me; one fact there can be <hi rend="italic">no</hi> doubt about! I had put a mark at the page last night; but fell out again this morning, and I could not with some effort recover it.&#x2014; On the whole, I bespeak a <hi rend="italic">Copy,</hi> so soon as this little Tour is printed, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I hope it may some day be.</p>
<p>London is perfectly silent as yet, and there is, for the most part, a very pretty <hi rend="italic">St Martin&#x2019;s Summer</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Warm weather in late autumn, around St. Martin&#x2019;s Day, <date when="1859-11-11">11 Nov.</date></note> given us; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> one pensively contemplates, and lives too lazily in the midst of.</p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I shove violently aside ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 20 of the stupidest and ugliest volumes in creation; and regardless of a heap of paper-clippings and confusions, send you this briefest of accounts, merely to keep y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> mind at ease.</p>
<p>Last Monday (this gone a week), I fairly opened shop again. I cannot say that I make shining progress,&#x2014;very far from that, Heaven help me!&#x2014;but I do make progress noticeable occasionally; I stand to it as faithfully as I can; and am certainly a good deal clearer in mind than when I last swept it away in summer past. My health is altogether, so far as I can judge, decidedly a shade better than when I <hi rend="italic">left</hi> <place>Chelsea</place>;&#x2014;I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hope to improve considerably after all, were I once <hi rend="italic">free</hi> of this unspeakable affair! Ah me, Ah me!&#x2014;&#x2014; The Horse, on which I saunter with intervals of gallop, regularly every day of the week but one, is now lodged close beside me (not 3 miles off), and get much help from, is in tolerable fettle; and I do hope the people are honest and will take care of him for me.</p>
<p>Jane herself, I must say, is hitherto perceptibly better also; thank Heaven!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Woolner had &#x201C;taken tea&#x201D; in the evening of <date when="1859-10-14">14 Oct.</date> with the Carlyles; he reported to Emily Tennyson, <date when="1859-10-15">15 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Mrs. Carlyle is much better than I have seen her looking for fully twelve months: she had been in a great way for some time in consequence of the cart having passed over the neck of her &#x2018;Nero&#x2019;; but after a few days he recovered and her grief assuaged. They both made very kind enquiries of you, but I was not able to give such a good account as I wished&#x201D; (Woolner 176).</note> The last 3 days she has been below par (owing to <hi rend="italic">sleep,</hi> as usual); but I hope it is only temporary; and that she is really a good deal more in a natural way than before. She is off to Richmond,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably to visit Margaret Welsh, returned to Richmond after the death of her son John in May.</note> I think, today; having determined (tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>-slept to a degree) upon driving out into the air, in the absence of <hi rend="italic">rain,</hi> which is so frequent upon us, in the shape of warm muddy showers of late.</p>
<p>This is really all I have to tell you, dear Sister; and the time is <hi rend="italic">done,</hi> at any rate!&#x2014; From Scotsbrig I hear nothing; am in Jack&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">debt</hi> withal: poor fellow, I doubt he has nothing definite to say ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> his winter movements.</p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>I am heartily sorry to hear of the misfortunes that have fallen upon you:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jones wrote, <date when="1859-10-19">19 Oct.</date>, detailing his misfortunes. He spent two years in prison for his political beliefs <date when="1848-07-00">July 1848</date> to <date when="1850-07-00">July 1850</date>, the harshness of the regime weakening his health; his wife had died of cancer in <date when="1857">1857</date>, leaving him with four young children to support. Jones had been forced to sell the radical journals and newspapers founded in the <date when="1850">1850</date>s, in order to pay the liabilities on his Chartist <hi rend="italic">People&#x2019;s Paper</hi> (<date when="1852">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858">58</date>), which he sold <date when="1858-06-00">June 1858</date>. He brought a libel action in July against G. W. M. Reynolds (<date when="1814">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879">79</date>;<ref target="volume-35/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23414"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), publisher of <hi rend="italic">Reynolds&#x2019;s Weekly Newspaper</hi> (<date when="1850">1850</date>&#x2013;<date when="1924">1924</date>), who had accused him of pilfering subscription funds from the <hi rend="italic">People&#x2019;s Paper.</hi> Jones was exonerated, but his financial circumstances forced him to abandon journalism and to return to his practice as a barrister on the Northern Circuit by the end of <date when="1859">1859</date>.</note> misfortunes some of them which provoke one&#x2019;s indignation; others of them to be received with silent sorrow, and acquiescence in the inevitable:&#x2014;in all, surely, a heavy lot for a man! Nor in regard to your most irritating and <pb id="pg-35-235" n="35:235"/>probably bitterest griefs, is there much consolation for me in considering from what source <hi rend="italic">they</hi> mostly sprang. I must not hide from you my own private opinion, fixed enough this long while, and growing yearly more so, that of all the Causes to which an Englishman of real faculty in these years could devote himself, the Cause of &#x201C;Chartism&#x201D; is the <hi rend="italic">least</hi> likely to prove beneficial, however honestly gone into.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC and JWC had visited the Westminster House of Correction, Tothill Fields, with John Forster, <date when="1849-02-00">Feb. 1849</date>; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490205-JWC-JW-01"><sic>23:224</sic><corr>JWC to JW, [<date when="1849-02-05">5? Feb. 1849</date>]</corr></ref>. TC, having seen Jones in the prison, described him in <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> as &#x201C;a philosophic or literary Chartist &#x2026; master of his own time and spiritual resources to, as I supposed, a really enviable extent. &#x2026; I fancied I, for my own part, so left with paper and ink, and all taxes and botherations shut-out from me, could have written such a Book as no reader will here ever get of me&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 20:53). Jones now wrote to TC: &#x201C;In one of your <hi rend="italic">Latter Day</hi> Pamphlets, you describe my &#x2018;comforts&#x2019; when I was a political prisoner in Westminster Prison, you were very&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">very</hi> mistaken as to my treatment and condition.&#x201D; He had previously replied in an open letter to &#x201C;My Countrymen,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Red Republican</hi>, <date when="1850-08-10">10 Aug. 1850</date>: &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle &#x2026; in one of his pamphlets, congratulated me on my imprisonment, because Tothill Fields was just the place to write a book in. &#x2026; I was denied the use of pen, ink, and paper, until <date when="1849-10-00">October 1849</date>, and then writing material were conceded under such restrictions, as rendered original compositions almost impossible.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>I have seen little of your Poetry or other Writings, being indeed much out of the way of all such things, in late years: but I have gathered the belief that you are a loyal-hearted, valiant man, placed in circumstances too perverse for you hitherto; that you have experienced villainy from the villainous; and that you deserve the sympathy of honest neighbours. Fain w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I augur for you, too, a field more worthy of your faculties in the coming years. But this must be as it can.</p>
<p>From a small fund at my disposal, I inclose for you the Bank-Cheque wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is here;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jones wrote: &#x201C;I name no sum&#x2014;but merely state that every additional pound is an additional comfort&#x2014;I make no apology for writing&#x2014;I only say, <hi rend="italic">I have no friends&#x2014;&#x2014;</hi>at least none whose <hi rend="italic">means</hi> enable them to assist me.&#x201D; TC noted in his checkbook: &#x201C;<date when="1859-10-20">20 Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1859</date> / To Ernest Jones (<hi rend="italic">Chartist</hi> Jones) / &#xa3;10..0..0&#x201D; (MS: NLS 20753).</note>&#x2014;much wishing it might help to lighten your distresses, and clear away some incumbrances from the path of a suffering meritorious man. To me you owe no thanks for it; only, please, return the inclosed Cover, as a sign that it has come to hand.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You are very good to write to me when I cannot write: y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to my mute message was welcome last monday,&#x2014;one of the few <hi rend="italic">uses</hi> poor Morris and his <pb id="pg-35-240" n="35:240"/>Raphael<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly TC had sent John A.

My daily riding consumes all my spare time: in the evening I am wearied out, good for nothing but reading, idly or not quite idly: to trim my lights and mount up to this gaunt shop (grown very cold too, of late nights) requires a great effort. My case is still <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> when &#x201C;daundering individuals,&#x201D; chiefly stupid fellows, come in upon me:&#x2014;I have no resource then but <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> them out; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I generally soon do!</p>
<p>I am certainly a small tho<hi rend="italic">t better</hi> for my long rustication; fresher, sometimes slightly clearer for my chaotic Task,&#x2014;to wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I lie with all my available strength; working as if it were to break prison; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it truly <hi rend="italic">is.</hi> Were I once thro&#x2019; it alive, I calculate on gradually getting a little less feckless, a little less miserable; that is all my hope now.&#x2014; Jane has evidently got a considerable relief by her Expedit<hi rend="italic">n;</hi> she goes out twice weekly in a brougham (&#x201C;neat fly&#x201D;), walks a little, <hi rend="italic">omnibuses</hi> a little, if the weather favour; sleeps <hi rend="italic">better,</hi> is fresh and lively in <hi rend="italic">comparison,</hi> tho&#x2019; still of extreme weakness. Let us be thankful, and hope! My horse seems to be getting brisk nearly as of old, we are on the best terms; and go sauntering and cantering alternately every day in the week but one. A dirty gum-boil is one of my sorrows too: it has been here thrice or twice before at the same season; fruit of riding in the damp twilight, I count it to be. My work makes <hi rend="italic">some</hi> progress; perhaps I may begin <hi rend="italic">printing</hi> (slowly) with the New Year! <hi rend="italic">Bronchitis,</hi> not very bad, comes and goes; loose <hi rend="italic">veins</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590825-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1859-08-25">25 Aug.</date></ref></note> somewhat in abeyance:&#x2014;thus I play my poor part.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Your Letter was a bright little phenomenon here; and brought us reminiscences and prospects of a pleasant nature,&#x2014;news even, new to <hi rend="italic">us,</hi> for we see hardly anybody, and hear of little that is passing in these foggy times.</p>
<p>For the rest, we are in tolerable heart; and can give rather a good account of ourselves, in answer to your kind inquiries. My Wife decidedly gained strength in the second half of our Fife rustication,&#x2014;the first half was passed by the sea-side;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Humbie Farm.</note> the second in a Country House<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Auchtertool House.</note> some miles inland; a much better <hi rend="italic">lodging</hi> this latter, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> suited the female nerves (&#x201C;excellent quiet place, so roomy and airy!&#x201D;)&#x2014;and there began an evident improvement. Which, I am happy to say, still lasts; some visible increase of strength, sleep &#x26;c; and better omens to face the coming winter with. Alas, there is nothing yet to brag of; far enough from that: but one is thankful for never so little.</p>
<p>As to me I did no farther good after quitting my friend the Sea: but I went dreaming about doing nothing, at least; in that way my heartbreaking Prussian Concern (comparable to poor Christian&#x2019;s &#x201C;Burden&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress</hi>) lay in abeyance; so that I could, in some slight degree, better <hi rend="italic">see</hi> it, and judge a little where (if anywhere) the true handles of it might be groped for. In fine I too feel slightly (very slightly) better, or fancy myself so; and am at work again, daily with what strength I have left, on that same thrice-disgusting Business,&#x2014;much wishing I were either dead or else had done with it! In which humble alternative I hope to be indulged one way or the other, by <pb id="pg-35-242" n="35:242"/>the Upper Powers and the Under! Pity me, dear F.; you may really, if you are benignly given: I never in all my life&#x2014;&#x2014; But in short I have a kind of hope to begin printing ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Newyears-day, and to be chaced thro&#x2019; it in perhaps a twelvemonth if I can live so long.</p>
<p>Poor Hunt, poor Stephen!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leigh Hunt and Sir James Stephen, who had both d. recently.</note> The ranks are getting thin to one&#x2019;s right and to one&#x2019;s left:&#x2014;it is an evident suggestion, &#x201C;Close, then; rank closer, &#x26; stick to one another, ye that still stand!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>If you but knew how I have been situated! (my Husbands favorite phrase) First I arrived so tired! Oh so dead tired! Notwithstanding that I actually summoned nerve to put in effect my often cherished idea of sleeping at York (half way) <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">an Inn!</hi> Odd! that I should never at this age have done that thing before, in my life! except once when after an absence of eighteen years I spent a night <hi rend="italic">Incognita</hi> in the George Inn of Haddington! where I <hi rend="italic">could not</hi> feel myself a mere traveller. It was a proof that my nerves were stronger&#x2014;if not my limbs&#x2014;that I really &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">carried out</hi>&#x201D; the York speculation, <hi rend="italic">when it came to the point.</hi> It would certainly have been again a failure however, but for a Lady in Fife<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Liddell; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590922-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1859-09-22">22 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> telling me of a comfortable Inn to stop at. I was to ask on getting out of the carriage &#x201C;was any porter from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Scawins here?&#x201D; Which I had no sooner done, than the name Scawen was shouted out in the sound of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Sowens</hi>&#x201D;! to my great shame!&#x2014; I feeling as if everybody knew where I was going; and that it was my first adventure of the sort!! But I was comfortably and quietly lodged&#x2014;no bugs&#x2014;no anything to molest me&#x2014;only that the tumult in my own blood me kept awake all night&#x2014; So that I arrived here as tired next evening, as if I had come the whole road at one horrid rush&#x2014;</p>
<p>And I hadn&#x2019;t much time allowed me to rest: for tho&#x2019; Charlotte had got down all the carpets, there were still quantities of details for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to do; before M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C came. And he staid only a week behind me&#x2014;</p>
<p>When the house was all in order for him; my cares were destined to take another turn&#x2014;even more engrossing. Just the night before his arrival, Charlotte went to some shops, taking the dog with her, and brought him home in her arms, all crumpled together like a crushed spider, and his poor little eyes protruding, and fixedly staring in his head! A Butcher&#x2019;s cart, driving furiously round a sharp corner, had passed over poor little Nero&#x2019;s Throat! and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> killed him on the spot!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201D; &#x2018;Butcher&#x2019;s cart passed over Nero&#x2019;s throat.&#x2019; Poor little foolish faithful dog! it killed him after all; was never well again. He died in some four months (<date when="1860-02-01">Feb. 1, 1860</date>, as the tablet said, while visible) with a degree of pitying sorrow even from me, which I am still surprised at. The wreck of poor Nero, who had to be strychnined by the doctor, was, and is still, memorable, sad and miserable to me, the last nocturnal walk he took with me, his dim white little figure in the universe of dreary black, and my then mood about &#x2018;Frederick&#x2019; and other things&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> But he looked killed enough at the first. When I tried <hi rend="italic">to</hi> <pb id="pg-35-244" n="35:244"/>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">stand him</hi> on the ground&#x201D; (as the servants here say) he flopped over on his side quite stiff and apparently unconscious!</p>
<p>You may figure my sensations! And I durst not show all my grief; Charlotte was so distressed and really could not have helped it!&#x2014; I put him in a warm bath&#x2014;and afterwards wrapt him warmly and laid him on a pillow&#x2014;and left him; without much hope of finding him alive in the morning.</p>
<p>But in the morning he still breathed, tho&#x2019; incapable of any movement: but he swallowed some warm milk that I put into his mouth&#x2014; About midday I was saying aloud &#x201C;poor dog&#x2014;poor little Nero!,&#x201D; when I saw the bit tail trying to wag itself!&#x2014; And after that, I had good hopes&#x2014; In another day he could raise his head to lap the milk himself&#x2014; And so by little and little, he recovered the use of himself&#x2014;but it was ten days before he was able to raise <hi rend="italic">a bark</hi>&#x2014;his first attempt was like the <hi rend="italic">scream</hi> of an infant!</p>
<p>It has been a revealation to me this of the strength of the throat of a dog!!&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C says if the wheel had gone over <hi rend="italic">anywhere else</hi> it would have killed him! A gentleman told me the other night that he once <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> a fine large dog run over&#x2014;the great wheel of one of Pickford&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >National moving company.</note> heavy-laden vans went over <hi rend="italic">its</hi> throat!! And the dog&#x2014;just rose up and shook itself!! It next staggered a little to one side and then a little to the other, as if drunk&#x2014;then it steadied itself, and walked composedly home!</p>
<p>When I was out of trouble with my dog, I had time to feel how very relaxing and depressing the air of Chelsea was for me&#x2014;as usual&#x2014;after the bracing climate of Scotland. I was perfectly <hi rend="italic">done,</hi> till M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C insisted on my setting up the carriage again, and providence put me on drinking water out of a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bitter cup</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is a new invention, very popular here this year! A cup made of the wood of Quassia which makes the water quite bitter in a minute&#x2014;of course a chip of quassie put into water would have the same effect, but nobody ever bid me take that! I thought for three or four days that I had discovered the grand panacea of Life! I felt so hungry! and so cheerful!! and so active! But one night I was seized with the horridest cramps!&#x2014;which quite took the shine out of quassia for me&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I dare say it was merely that I had quite neglected my bowels  I haven&#x2019;t had courage to recommence with the &#x201C;bitter cup&#x201C;&#x2014;but it will come!

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your obliging 3 Nightshirts came by Parcel Post yesterday; James jun<hi rend="italic">r</hi> had announced them a few days before,&#x2014;two or three days <hi rend="italic">after</hi> we had had the satisfaction of seeing him again, looking brisk and well to do. He promised us his Father &#x201C;in the course of the week&#x201C;: but that, it appears, is all gone aback again.</p>
<p>The Shirts as a proof of your assiduous affection to me are extremely welcome, dear Sister; and there is no doubt they will do duty with effect when called upon, and be welcome in another humbler way. By the kindness of The Gill Lasses,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary and James Austin&#x2019;s das.</note> or from some other source conjoined, I found myself laird of at least 3 perhaps 4 effectual <hi rend="italic">new</hi> fellows (besides the old lumber, mended or thrown away): so that I now possess either 7 or 6,&#x2014;enough to serve me all the rest of my life, I think; at least <hi rend="italic">abundance</hi> richly for the years that now are! Many thanks for all your care of so useless an old cracked vessel&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am now about to employ you on another clothing operation,&#x2014;clothing, namely, for the <hi rend="italic">feet;</hi> feet apt to grow cold, on horseback in the winter twilights at this season. You must understand I have most elaborate pair of galoche-overalls (cloth and leather, fruit of profound study by the Tailor<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably John and George Sampson; TC had paid them &#xa3;4 10s. for leggings, <date when="1859-01-13">13 Jan.</date>; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590914-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1859-09-14">14 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> and me last <pb id="pg-35-246" n="35:246"/>winter, and of a disgusting <hi rend="italic">expense</hi> withal); overalls which button up far over the knee (beautiful thick &#x201C;military blue&#x201D;) and end in a pair of leather galoches, ready to take in any reasonable <hi rend="italic">boot</hi> I can be wearing; and of such <hi rend="italic">soles</hi> &#x26;c that you can walk about with them (in a steady but clogged manner) along the muddy streets on dismounting. They are really a protection from the cold, especially handy in <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> times. I find, however, that here as elsewhere, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">hard</hi> to <hi rend="italic">hard</hi>&#x201D; (leather to leather) does not do; and that a <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> outer covering w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been much better,&#x2014;failing wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> a soft <hi rend="italic">inner</hi> equipment, not <hi rend="italic">boots,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">woolleny</hi> matter, is all that I have of resourced.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> I accordingly keep on my leather slippers (very thin supple articles), draw over these a pair of old loose-knit &#x201C;stocking-boot&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">socks</hi> (packing in the skirts of the trousers); and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> buckle on my overalls: wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> plan is clearly the <hi rend="italic">best.</hi> But now attend, after this preliminary of such length:</p>
<p>1<hi rend="superscript"><hi rend="italic">o</hi></hi>. The &#x201C;Stockingboot&#x201D; socks (a &#x201C;rig-and-fur&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The ridged pattern on a piece of ribbed knitting.</note> article, <hi rend="italic">intended</hi> for some such purpose,&#x2014;sitting outside a coach, or the like) were given me by poor Alick many years ago; and <hi rend="italic">now</hi> when they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come to be of such use, the <hi rend="italic">moths</hi> have nearly quite done for them!&#x2014; I want a new pair of socks of that kind; best stuff and structure you can get, plenty of <hi rend="italic">spring,</hi> plenty of size: I will <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> your Artist whatever she can earn by taking <hi rend="italic">pains</hi> upon them.</p>
<p>2<hi rend="superscript"><hi rend="italic">o</hi></hi>. Much better than any slippers (far softer and far warmer) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a pair of orthodox old &#x201C;roon-shoon&#x201D; (list-shoes),<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Indoor shoes made of strips of list, or selvage, sewn together; carpet slippers at this time did not have heels.</note> especially if they were knit <hi rend="italic">high in the heel quarter,</hi> so as to <hi rend="italic">fasten</hi> round the ancle, like a pair of &#x201C;quarter boots.&#x201D; That w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a nice thing, with or without one&#x2019;s &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">socks</hi>&#x201D; over them!&#x2014;</p>
<p>In short, I want you to consider these two articles, and see if you can find stuff and people fit, and bring them to pass, on my behalf. I send the <hi rend="italic">measure,</hi> taken and described as near as I can: measure for <hi rend="italic">shoes</hi> of course directs that of socks too. Do your best; but needn&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">hurry</hi> either!</p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>We are getting very anxious to see you here, or even to hear of you in an explicit direct way.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had expected to see Lord Ashburton in London in Oct.; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590818-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1859-08-18">18 Aug.</date></ref></note> Ever since we returned hither (first days of the month), <pb id="pg-35-247" n="35:247"/>there has been a rumour of you, &#x201C;Coming, just at hand&#x201D;; and the rumour always postpones itself again, and takes up new ground, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> again proves false. &#x201C;Expected on the 10<hi rend="italic">th,</hi>&#x201D; that what<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> I heard first; then, twice, in succession, by side-chance, I heard of you as due at Linlathen &#x201C;day after tomorrow&#x201D;; neither of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> days held good. My horse and I have gone round by Bath House, 4 times, regardless of the slipperiness of Piccadilly, to look out for you,&#x2014;Horse, I perceive, as diligent in scanning as myself, anxious he too in his way,&#x2014;but it is to no purpose; all the Three Gates are scrupulously shut, windows screened; and we have to slide our ways again. Till yesterday, incidentally falling in with Dr Rous, he grieves me by the news that you have a fit of gout again, still at Brahan Castle,&#x2014;&#x201C;probably a bad fit, as you report yourself in bed!&#x201C;&#x2014; This is not good news at all. I beg a little word, the first time you can without bother: or if writing in the horizontal posture is too disagreeable, perhaps the Beneficent Lady<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Louisa Ashburton.</note> will help us on the occasion? I have heard farther of your intending for Egypt again; of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I know not what to think,&#x2014;except that it will eclipse you from <hi rend="italic">me</hi> for a long while to come; tho&#x2019; indeed poor &#x201C;I&#x201D; have hardly eyes to see with, at any rate, except in one dreary direction, &#x26; fixed on one unbeautiful object! If you can return, as last time, in improved health, it will be an expedition well worth doing. My own private theory at present is, you have been taking too much out of yourself: one has to learn that secret (and usually pay smart for not believing it quite readily) at a certain stage of life;&#x2014;I myself never fairly ascertained, till in late months, that I must henceforth lay it to heart, as a fact of sure moment. Be wise, and keep an eye on this, when Deer &#x26;c tempt!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have no news to interest you. I see nobody,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had seen David Masson (<date when="1822">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1907">1907</date>; <ref target="volume-35/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34924"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430724-JWC-TC-01"><sic>16:312</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-07-24">24 July 1843</date>]</corr></ref>), biographer, literary critic, and ed., <date when="1859-10-28">28 Oct.</date> Masson wrote, <date when="1859-10-29">29 Oct.</date>, enclosing &#x201C;the extract about Cromwell I mentioned last night&#x201D; and hoping that TC would write something for <hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, of which he was the first editor; it began <date when="1859-11-01">1 Nov.</date>.

And I hope to live to shake hands with him again and give him a hearty kiss!&#x2014;&#x2014;as if <hi rend="italic">that</hi> could do much for him at the present date!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I really think M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is pretty well at present, His appetite is good&#x2014;indeed <hi rend="italic">that</hi> scarcely ever fails him, and his sleep is much improved&#x2014;and he goes on regularly, if not so rapidly as he would like, with his Book. But he has got such a bad habit of constantly talking with exaggerative Calyleian<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> eloquence of all his ailments great and small, that it is not from what <hi rend="italic">he says,</hi> so much as from what <hi rend="italic">oneself sees</hi> that his amount of good or ill health is to be estimated, and of course oneself mayn&#x2019;t always see clearly.</p>
<p>The worst symptom I observe in him at the present time or for a long time back is his excessive irritability. But I scarcely believe <hi rend="italic">that</hi> to be now a symptom of illness so much as a bad habit which he has <hi rend="italic">let himself go to</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Please to send what I am here writing <hi rend="italic">no farther</hi>&#x2014; Indeed burn my letter&#x2014;It is one of the disadvantages of being connected with a distinguished man, that ones own little obscure letters and speeches must be written and spoken always under a chilling sense of future Biographers! to say nothing of present Gossipers!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Meanwhile my Cat has been confined of four kittens! and only <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of them being bespoke, I told Charlotte to drown the other two, which was done before they had come to consciousness of being alive. A deep hole was then <pb id="pg-35-249" n="35:249"/>dug for them in the garden, and they were put in, and covered up. In spite of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s assertion that &#x201C;Cats have no arithmetic,&#x2014;are quite insensible to whether you leave them <hi rend="italic">one</hi> kitten or four&#x201D; my Cat showed much perturbation of mind when her two kittens were removed&#x2014;and left the two living ones, to see what Charlotte was doing with the dead ones&#x2014;running between the two in the kitchen and the two getting buried with a great deal of perplexed mewing. She certainly had a dim notion of arithmetic for the next few hours&#x2014;it was night before her mewings ceased&#x2014;that was eight days ago. Yesterday I was standing at the back door, and I saw the Cat tearing laboriously at the place where the kittens had disappeared, and uttering sharp wailing <hi rend="italic">cries</hi> rather than mews. She made a hole as deep as herself and then unable to dig deeper she stood over it in a musing, perplexed way, and finally went slowly back to the live <hi rend="italic">kittens!</hi></p>
