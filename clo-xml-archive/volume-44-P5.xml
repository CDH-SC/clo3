</head>
<p>The letters in this volume cover the twelve-month span from <date when="1866-07">July 1866</date> to <date when="1867-07">June 1867</date> and include 138 of Thomas Carlyle&#x02019;s letters, plus his notes, <date when="1867-02-26">26 February 1867</date>, to photographs of Menton, and his bequest of Craigenputtoch to Edinburgh University (both draft and final forms). In <date when="1866-04">April 1866</date> TC began an elegiac memoir of Jane Welsh Carlyle in the hope that this process of reconstructing his past might somehow redeem his sorrowful present. Having completed this work at the end of July, he then wrote memoirs of Edward Irving, Francis Jeffrey, Robert Southey, and William Wordsworth, finishing the last one in Menton <date when="1867-03-08">8 March 1867</date>. What distinguished the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> (<date when="1881">1881</date>) from the outset was TC&#x02019;s unflinching honesty, which defied conventional expectations and as Kenneth J. Fielding and Ian Campbell argued, &#x0201C;broke through much more forcibly into authenticity in experience and style&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> xiii). Throughout this period TC was torn between doubt and anger, and his correspondence reflected this deep inward conflict. On the one hand he was nagged by the fear that he was cloistering himself in the sanctum of his pain and indulging in what Matthew Arnold called &#x0201C;the dialogue of the mind with itself.&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">1. &#x0201C;Preface to Poems <date when="1853">1853</date>,&#x0201D; Matthew Arnold, <hi rend="italic">Complete Prose Works</hi>, ed. R. H. Super (<date when="1960">1960</date>) 1:1.</note> On the other, he was driven by a desire to justify himself and JWC as writers who had bravely refused to be courted by the <hi rend="italic">&#x0201C;Plebs</hi> of Literature&#x0201D; or to be swayed by the temptations of popularity and fame. Wavering between reclusiveness and social engagement, TC struggled to resist being consumed by his grief. Reluctantly, he strove to vacate his <hi rend="italic">&#x0201C;religious</hi> city of refuge&#x0201D; and to heed the exhortation that JWC conveyed through his dreams to <hi rend="italic">&#x0201C;work</hi> a little longer, if thou still canst&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 395, 198, 150).</p>
<p>This acute tension in TC&#x02019;s outlook was evident in the concluding remarks that he appended to his memorial of JWC on <date when="1866-07-28">28 July 1866</date>. Noting the coincidence of completing the draft on the same day that arrangements for her gravestone in Haddington church had been finalized, he upbraided himself for his idle and pointless recollections: &#x0201C;In these very minutes &#x02026; the Tomb is now <hi rend="italic">complete</hi>, and as it should be. Once I hope to see <hi rend="italic">it</hi> again; and then (possibly) my native Scotland never more.&#x02014; Everything admonishes me to <hi rend="italic">end</hi> here my poor scrawlings and weak reminiscences of days that are no more. I still mainly mean to <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> this Book before my own departure; but feel that I <pb id="pg-44-xiv" n="44:xiv"/>shall always have a kind of grudge to do it, and an indolent excuse, &#x02018;Not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi>; wait, any day that can be done!&#x02019;&#x02014;and that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> possible the thing may be left behind me, legible to interested survivors,<hi rend="italic">&#x02014;friends</hi> only, I will hope.&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Poor&#x0201D; as these &#x0201C;scrawlings&#x0201D; were, they served as a symbol of the emotional and intellectual solidarity between him and JWC. No one else, not even close <hi rend="italic">&#x0201C;friends</hi>,&#x0201D; could ever fathom the depth of their bond. In a defiant mood, he expressly forbade &#x0201C;each and all, to <hi rend="italic">publish</hi> this Bit of Writing <hi rend="italic">as it stands here</hi>; and warn &#x02026; that <hi rend="italic">without fit editing</hi> no <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of it should be printed &#x02026; and that the <hi rend="italic">&#x02018;fit</hi> editing&#x02019; of perhaps nine-tenths of it will, after I am gone, have become <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi>&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 198&#x02013;99). Trapped between the need to communicate and the desire to protect his sacred shrine, TC delayed the destruction of the manuscript.</p>
<p>He accepted that this act of &#x0201C;devotion&#x0201D; to JWC was benefiting him emotionally. On 8 August he told Lady Louisa Ashburton that it &#x0201C;<supplied>[h]</supplied>as done me a great deal of good in searching thro&#x02019; the Affairs of the Past. I have been at that, day after day, all summer; at all hours, in a sacred, sad &#x02003; quasi-religious kind of company with Her who has left me forever: this has been the far best solace I have had; and with <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, in gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> , I have preferred to be left alone when permitted.&#x0201D; He questioned whether &#x0201C;any <hi rend="italic">work</hi> yet remains to me,&#x0201D; and surmised that &#x0201C;the ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is still evi<hi rend="italic">dtly</hi> a goodish way off.&#x0201D; On <date when="1866-10-27">27 October</date>, he informed Thomas Erskine, &#x0201C;I have been and am very sad, sad as death I may well say; but not miserable either; nothing of the mean wretchedness which has defaced other long portions of my life. This is all noble, tender, solemn to me. I might define it as a time of divine <hi rend="italic">worship</hi> rather, perhaps the only period of real <hi rend="italic">worship</hi> I have known for a great while past.&#x0201D; In other moments, he felt devastated by his irrevocable separation from JWC. To his brother Alexander living in Canada, he confessed that &#x0201C;her loss has been the loss of all that made life valuable; and I do not seem to gather much insensibility to it; but at all hours of the day, and every turn of my procedures in the world, am painfully reminded that <hi rend="italic">she</hi>, my bright fellow-pilgrim, has gone from me beyond the stars, and that the rest of my journey must be done wearily <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-44/lt-18661020-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1866-10-20">20 Oct. 1866</date>
</ref>).</p>
<p>Yet in &#x0201C;natural supernatural&#x0201D; ways, TC was emotionally and intellectually closer to JWC than he had been for the last two decades of her life. The moral &#x0201C;beggary&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-44/lt-18660808-TC-LLA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1866-08-08">8 Aug. 1866</date>
</ref>) of England in <date when="1866">1866</date> reminded him vividly of <date when="1848">1848</date> and the &#x0201C;time preceding <hi rend="italic">[Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi>],&#x0201D; when &#x0201C;my heart was long overloaded with the meanings at length uttered there, and no way of getting them set forth would answer.&#x0201D; Then it was JWC who had helped him to get &#x0201C;delivered of my black electricities and consuming fires.&#x0201D; She &#x0201C;went along with me in everything &#x02026; and minded no whit any results that might follow this evident <hi rend="italic">speaking of the truth</hi>&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 149). It was JWC&#x02019;s lambent spiritual presence that encouraged TC to &#x0201C;fix his <pb id="pg-44-xv" n="44:xv"/>thoughts&#x0201D; on the present &#x0201C;Condition of England.&#x0201D; He was engaging in his own version of Irving&#x02019;s &#x0201C;speaking with tongues,&#x0201D; listening for the sound of her distinctive voice while silently contemplating the details of her former existence. In TC&#x02019;s mind she had resumed her role as his &#x0201C;complete Approver&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 149). From the grave, he could hear her exhorting him to attack the vices of the age with reckless &#x0201C;veracity.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>JWC&#x02019;s influence was especially evident in TC&#x02019;s continued involvement in the Governor Eyre controversy. While he was in Edinburgh in <date when="1866-04">April 1866</date>, TC had savored her report of a heated exchange that she had conducted with Abraham Hayward, the translator and author, who had condemned Eyre&#x02019;s use of excessive force in an article in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x02019;s</hi>. To Hayward&#x02019;s declaration that &#x0201C;no <hi rend="small-caps">man</hi> living could stand up for Eyre <hi rend="italic">now</hi>,&#x0201D; she retorted, &#x0201C;I hope M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle does. &#x02026; I haven&#x02019;t had an opportunity of asking him, but I should be surprised and grieved if I found <hi rend="small-caps">him</hi> sentimentalizing over a pack of black brutes&#x0201D; (<sic>
<date when="1866-04-10">10 April 1866</date>;</sic>see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660410-JWC-TC-01">
<sic>43:176-77</sic>JWC to TC, [<date when="1866-04-10">10 April 1866</date>]</ref>). D. A. Wilson speculated that the episode &#x0201C;may have been prophetic, or may have inspired Carlyle to take &#x02026; the line he adopted&#x0201D; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 6:62). In the aftermath of JWC&#x02019;s death, TC took to defending Eyre in a romantic idiom that would have appealed deeply to the self-proclaimed descendant of William Wallace and John Knox. He informed Lady Ashburton on <date when="1866-09-07">7 September</date>, &#x0201C;You never heard such a shriekery and psalmody of curses as is going on round the humane modest &#x02003; heroic Eyre (all this I have construed him to be, tho&#x02019; I never saw him nor wish to see): he is economically ruined withal; has served the Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 25 years, &#x02026; is now thrown into the street by both Gov<hi rend="italic">vts</hi> &#x02003; has <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> of income. That is a reward for quelling Nigger insurrect<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> isn&#x02019;t it?&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-44/lt-18660907-TC-LLA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1866-09-07">7 Sept. 1866</date>
</ref>).</p>
<p>Over the summer months he labored diligently to organize the Eyre Defence Committee and to enlist the aid of Charles Dickens, Charles Kingsley, Alfred Tennyson, and John Ruskin. But the more embroiled TC became in the affair, the less tolerant he became of its complexities and repercussions. He persisted with the campaign largely because, as he explained in his journal later in the year, &#x0201C;<supplied>[t]</supplied>hat is something &#x02026; <hi rend="italic">she</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have liked&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-12-30">30 Dec. 1867</date>). On <date when="1866-09-27">27 September</date> Ruskin forwarded him a dossier of material detailing Eyre&#x02019;s incompetence as governor of Jamaica that had been compiled and sent to him by George Price, a liberal plantation owner and a prominent member of the Jamaican Legislative Assembly. Among the documents were detailed newspaper accounts of Eyre&#x02019;s culpability in the &#x0201C;Tramway Scandal,&#x0201D; which had provoked a public inquiry and a demand for his resignation in <date when="1865">1865</date>. TC replied indignantly: &#x0201C;I have ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> read all these Letters; but do not, from Mr Price &#x02026; get the least glimmer of new light ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x02018;the Tramway swindle&#x02019; or any of the other miracles alleged,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I can only conceive as more or less <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> misbirths of that nearly <hi rend="italic">in</hi>conceivable little <hi rend="italic">chaos in a coalbox</hi> &#x02026; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> they call &#x02018;House of Assembly&#x02019;; all intent upon <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> of various kinds, while their<pb id="pg-44-xvi" n="44:xvi"/>Governor was pushing towards work and result. A mere heap of flaming soot; abstrusely equal to zero for us! Mr Price, I have no reason to doubt, was and is perfectly honest and bonâ-fide; but need not concern us farther&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-44/lt-186600927-TC-JRU-01">TC to <sic>JR</sic>
<corr>JRU</corr>, <date when="1866-09-27">27 Sept. 1866</date>
</ref>).</p>
<p>Ruskin was probably not personally convinced, but he wrote back immediately to assure TC that &#x0201C;your kind note being &#x02026; quite enough for me&#x0201D; (<date when="1866-09-29">29 Sept. 1866</date>; Cate 121). Beneath the surface of the relationship between the &#x0201C;Sage&#x0201D; and his disciple, there was considerable uncertainty and distrust on both sides. Suffering dizzy spells and blurred vision, and agonizing about his love for Rose La Touche, Ruskin felt incapable of playing the role that TC had assigned to him as an activist and proselytizer. The violent outcry and the mass protests against Eyre had unsettled Ruskin and obliged him to consider the case against the governor more <hi rend="italic">calmly</hi> than TC, who relished playing the part of the provocateur. He sympathized with Ruskin&#x02019;s frustrations, but his loyalty to the &#x0201C;cause&#x0201D; he and JWC shared seems to have overridden feelings that might have rendered him less hostile to any criticism of the Jamaican governor. In his speech to the Eyre Defence and Aid Fund on <date when="1866-09-05">5 September 1866</date>, Ruskin prefaced his justification of Eyre&#x02019;s actions with a carefully measured assessment of his own motives. He had joined the committee &#x0201C;in the simple desire of obtaining justice, not for black men only, nor for white, but for men of every race and colour. He detested all cruelty, and all injustice by whomsoever inflicted, or suffered&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">(Eyre Defence</hi> 21). TC agreed in principle with these sentiments. In the petition that he composed early <date when="1868">1868</date>, he expressed his contempt for &#x0201C;seditious Incendiaries, of black-savage type or of white-savage&#x0201D; (Workman 99). Still, TC would have liked Ruskin to argue in a more intemperate and aggressive fashion. His summary of the speech to Caroline Davenport Bromley&#x02014;&#x0201C;a right gallant thrust. &#x02026; While all the world stands tremulous, shilly-shallying from the gutter, impetuous Ruskin plunges his rapier up to the very hilt in the abominable belly of the vast blockheadism&#x0201D; (<date when="1866-09-15">15 Sept. 1866</date>)&#x02014;succinctly revealed his own rhetorical preferences.</p>
<p>In reality, this description of Ruskin the agitator was more relevant to TC. His essay &#x0201C;Shooting Niagara: And After?&#x0201D; was not published until <date when="1867-08">August 1867</date>, but a crossed-out date at the conclusion of a manuscript fragment held at the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Duke University indicates that he was working on it at least twelve months prior to its appearance.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">2.

Between <date when="1866-07">July 1866</date> and <date when="1867-06">June 1867</date>, TC&#x02019;s letters bristled with indignation at the manifold signs of Britain&#x02019;s social and political decadence, in language that anticipated &#x0201C;Shooting Niagara.&#x0201D; The metaphor of the country paddling obliviously to its watery doom dominated his imagination. In his journal he wrote, &#x0201C;Is not Nat<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Death &#x02026; perhaps preferable to such utter Rottenness of Nat<hi rend="italic">l Life</hi>? &#x02026; <supplied>[A]</supplied>ll England &#x02026; embarking on the Niagara rapids, called &#x02018;Reform Bill,&#x02019; is strangely indiff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to <hi rend="italic">whatever</hi> may follow it&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-05-26">26 May 1867</date>).</p>
<p>TC&#x02019;s pessimism was somewhat mitigated by the emergence of Germany as a leading European power. He was delighted to receive a letter from his friend and former researcher Joseph Neuberg on <date when="1866-08-23">23 August 1866</date>&#x02014;the same day that the Treaty of Prague ratified the terms of Prussia&#x02019;s victory over Austria&#x02014;and described it as the &#x0201C;pleasantest&#x0201D; he &#x0201C;had for a long time.&#x0201D; Neuberg announced: &#x0201C;Bismarck is the hero of the day; his portraits are on all the shop windows. I send you one, if you care to have it. It is not a lovely face; but he has brought about great things. &#x02026; And you have been the only one, that I know, who recognised him as &#x02018;distinguished,&#x02019; when all the world cursed him&#x0201D; (JN to TC, <date when="1866-08-21">21 Aug. 1866</date>). Neuberg was not exaggerating. Previously vilified by the British press, Bismarck was now being hailed as a Carlylean hero. In an editorial a week earlier, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> declared: &#x0201C;There is now no longer any check upon the great career of Count Bismark [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. &#x02026; His progress has hitherto been marked by great, rapid, decisive strides. He has broken whatever he could not bend. He has taken fortune, the world&#x02019;s opinion, his countrymen&#x02019;s suffrage, by storm. He has made the blunders of his foes, no less than the exploits of his armies, subservient to his purpose. Austria is at his feet, not only crushed, but discredited&#x0201D; (<date when="1866-08-16">16 Aug. 1866</date>).</p>
<p>TC was astonished and delighted by this change of attitude and by the new balance of power on the continent. He replied to Neuberg: &#x0201C;That Germany is to stand on her feet henceforth &#x02026; with clear steel in her hand, and an honest purpose in her heart&#x02014;this seems to me the best news we or Europe have heard for the last forty years or more&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-44/lt-18660823-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1866-08-23">23 Aug. 1866</date>
</ref>). Prussia&#x02019;s ascendance not only revived his belief in the possibility that British &#x0201C;laissez-faire&#x0201D; democracy might be challenged by a superior &#x0201C;Teutonic&#x0201D; model, but also that his arduous labors in writing <hi rend="italic">The History of Frederick the Great</hi> had not been entirely wasted. Once more, the public and private spheres of his life intersected. In the reminiscences of JWC, he recalled the thirteen-year period of the book&#x02019;s composition, &#x0201C;much the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> we ever had.&#x0201D; While he had immersed himself in the &#x0201C;dead-lift&#x0201D; effort of making order out of his<pb id="pg-44-xviii" n="44:xviii"/>&#x0201C;Prussian <hi rend="italic">Blockheadisms</hi>,&#x0201D; she had lapsed into illness, depression, and withdrawal. He was haunted by the image of her &#x0201C;reclining on the sofa&#x0201D; in the evenings, &#x0201C;weak, but I knew little how weak,&#x0201D; while he complained of his travails in writing &#x0201C;of the <hi rend="italic">Battle of Mollwitz</hi>.&#x0201D; Compared to the memory of her &#x0201C;courage, patience, [and] silent heroism,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> was as insignificant as &#x0201C;the <hi rend="italic">dung</hi> of a thousand centuries ago.&#x0201D; The book had deserved its fate, to &#x0201C;wander into the belly of oblivion for ever&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 155&#x02013;56). Yet with dramatic suddenness, events had breathed fresh relevance into TC&#x02019;s Prussian epic, lending it topicality and thrusting its author toward the center of a crucial debate about Britain&#x02019;s future relations with Germany. Any temptation that he had to gloat was checked by his nagging realization of what had been sacrificed for the sake of his vindication as the &#x0201C;Sage of Chelsea.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Prussia&#x02019;s triumph in <date when="1866">1866</date> sharpened TC&#x02019;s desire to antagonize the liberal establishment in England. Writing to Eyre, <date when="1866-11-1">1 November 1866</date>, he ridiculed John Stuart Mill&#x02019;s Jamaica Committee, which had originally announced that it had &#x0201C;imperatively needed &#x000A3;10,000&#x0201D; for its prosecution of the governor for murder, but as of yet had only received &#x0201C;&#x000A3;475 some shillings &#x02003; some pence.&#x0201D; The committee had denounced Eyre for flouting the rule of law, yet the only laws that were respected and obeyed at home were those dictated by the &#x0201C;Respectable Professors of the Dismal Science&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">(Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi>, Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 20:44). The Jamaica Committee had effectively endorsed public disorder: &#x0201C;Very contemptible and very lamentable to me, their noises and they; intrinsically little better &#x02026; than angry and hungry dogs barking in the gutter, and making night hideous,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> they do contrive to accomplish: hideous, and even alarming, in this sad night of the Anarchies, and of the &#x02018;Governments&#x02019; whose principle appears to be, &#x02018;Shudder at contradiction!&#x02019; and &#x02018;How sit the winds and the Newspapers Articles?&#x02019; &#x02026; I ask, with surprise and apprehension, What are we arriving at? Is the thing I have long prophesied as inevitable, so near upon <hi rend="italic">fulfilm</hi>t, then?&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-44/lt-18661101-TC-EJE-01">TC to E. J. Eyre, <date when="1866-11-01">1 Nov. 1866</date>
</ref>). These were the questions that he needed to ask in order to prepare himself to unmask the &#x0201C;universal rottenness, and quagmire of mendacities, in which poor England is drowning&#x0201D; (&#x0201C;Shooting Niagara,&#x0201D; Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:9).</p>
<p>On <date when="1866-11-28">28 November 1866</date> TC announced to his brother John that he had finally decided, after months of procrastination, to accept Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s invitation to stay with her at her rented villa in Menton, a French resort on the Mediterranean. The catalyst in persuading TC to go was his friend and disciple John Tyndall, who &#x0201C;was here last night, one of the most determined of mankind; insists on setting off with me, depositing me scathless;&#x02014;and will then, &#x02018;after 6 hours or so,&#x02019; <hi rend="italic">return</hi>! I was shocked to hear of such a thing undertaken for my sake; but it was vain to remonstrate. &#x02026; He is a strange, lean ardent kind of soul.&#x0201D; By 1 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi>, <date when="1866-12-24">24 December1866</date>, they had reached their destination after two and a half days of travel from London. TC&#x02019;s senses were <pb id="pg-44-xix" n="44:xix"/>invigorated by the change of climate and scenery, notwithstanding the long and exhausting journey by rail and carriage. From Menton he wrote to his sister Jean Carlyle Aitken, recapturing their journey in rich and precise detail: &#x0201C;We left Paris &#x02026; and ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 6 on Sunday morning, saw that the dirty raw-frosty vapours, w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had continued with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a moment&#x02019;s interrupt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> from London onward, had fled quite away; and that a beautiful <hi rend="italic">summer</hi> sunrise was colouring the western horizon, and that we were close upon Marseilles and the Mediterranean. Beautiful &#x02003; strange the difference of climate&#x0201D; (<date when="1866-12-24">24 Dec.1866</date>).</p>
<p>TC was overwhelmed by the natural beauty of his surroundings. To John Forster, <date when="1867-01-24">24 January 1867</date>, he wrote: &#x0201C;I am doing tolerably in this new locat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; and sometimes almost begin to think there is a faint perceptibility of real improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in health since I left Chelsea. &#x02026; Our Town itself is curiously exotic; built like a little Sussex-Coast Town, along the shore, or miscellaneously sprawling up the steep cliffs &#x02026; towering up, visibly, for 6 miles behind us, invisibly for 60 or more &#x02026; into the airiest beautifullest ragged peaks and steeples I ever saw; the strange beauty of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> &#x02026; is still <hi rend="italic">new</hi> to me every morning when I first sally out.&#x0201D; He reveled in the simplicity of the locals and compared them unfavorably with the English residents of the town, distinguished by &#x0201C;plenty of money, &#x02003; no great share of any better endow<hi rend="italic">t</hi>: a populat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> &#x02026; rather to be avoided than sought for.&#x0201D; A visit from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Gladstone, only intensified his disgust with British politics and politicians. After enduring &#x0201C;several hours of [Gladstone] in this house,&#x0201D; TC was relieved to be rid of his &#x0201C;talk ponderous &#x02003; copious, but to me of no use or emolument&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-44/lt-18670124-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1867-01-24">24 Jan. 1867</date>
</ref>). Issues of deeper import took precedence in his mind.</p>
<p>In Menton, TC was engrossed by the spiritual dimension of the past, as he completed his reminiscences of Irving and Jeffrey, and forged ahead with Southey and Wordsworth. His very surroundings were saturated in piety and pathos. Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s Villa Madonna had once been part of a convent with its adjacent chapel; they stood on the grounds of the ex-summer palace of the prince of Monaco. In a letter to his brother John A. Carlyle, <date when="1867-01-25">25 January 1867</date>, he recounted that &#x0201C;the Chapel, still free for use, &#x02003; accessible from a Country road that passes close, is directly under Villa <hi rend="italic">drawing-room</hi>, and the big old Bell is still visibly attached to an outside corner of the same: Bell wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I almost rub upon daily is tied up into perfect dumbness; Chapel without even a <hi rend="italic">bambino</hi> or candle-end in it &#x02026; seems to have seen its finis as &#x02018;Chapel.&#x02019;&#x0201D; He was still prone to scourge himself for his solipsistic literary excursions, explaining to Ruskin, <date when="1867-02-15">15 February 1867</date>, that the &#x0201C;worst of my existence here is that I am thoroughly idle,&#x02014;for the &#x02018;work&#x02019; I try at intervals is a mockery of work.&#x0201D; Yet he persisted with the endeavor because it seemed to validate his existence as a writer, and JWC&#x02019;s as his critical &#x0201C;Approver.&#x0201D; To Emerson he repeated his intention &#x0201C;to burn [these things] out of the way before I myself <pb id="pg-44-xx" n="44:xx"/>die.&#x0201D; Still, the reminiscences constituted &#x0201C;&#x02018;the work&#x02019; of my day [because] to me, if to no other, it is useful; to reduce matters to writing means that you shall know them, see them in their origins &#x02003; sequences, in their essential lineaments, considerably better than you ever did before&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-01-27">27 Jan. 1867</date>).</p>
<p>Having decided to return to Chelsea toward the end of February, TC declined Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s proposal to accompany her on a tour of Italy, including Rome, Bologna, and Florence. Writing from Chelsea, <date when="1867-03-18">18 March 1867</date>, he gave details of the homeward journey and recorded his pleasure in taking &#x0201C;an hour&#x02019;s promenade on the old-known streets of Paris (for I went strolling to various old places I had seen 43 years ago with a silent tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that I was now seeing them for the final time) amid the novel popula<hi rend="italic">tns</hi>, and their brisk French features, and my memories of them for the last 100 years and prophecies of them for the next 100 &#x02026; fully equal &#x02026; to what the best <hi rend="italic">oil</hi> &#x02003; canvas &#x02018;gallery,&#x02019; in Rome or elsewhere, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have yielded. &#x02026; For <hi rend="italic">this</hi> &#x02026; was &#x02018;painted&#x02019; by Almighty God, who far excels Raphael or Titian.&#x0201D; The return to Cheyne Row inevitably left him downcast, especially with the impending anniversary of JWC&#x02019;s death filling him with a renewed sense of desolation and loneliness. He wrote to Lady Ashburton, <date when="1867-04-20">20 April 1867</date>: &#x0201C;These days are the anniversary of my Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> ones last year. By the day of the week, this <hi rend="italic">saturday</hi>; by the day of the month, tomorrow (Easter Sunday), ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 3 p.m., there happened&#x02014;I need not tell you what; nor how the memory of it must forever dwell with me; with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> for all manner of reasons, best <hi rend="italic">speakable</hi> to my own heart alone.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>His personal anguish was compounded by the news of Joseph Neuberg&#x02019;s death on <date when="1867-03-22">22 March 1867</date>. In a remarkably frank and detailed biographical tribute that he wrote in his journal, TC acknowledged his profound indebtedness to his loyal friend and assistant. He had no doubts about Neuberg&#x02019;s importance to him: &#x0201C;For the last 20 or 25 years, he had been my most attached adherent, ever-loyal, ever patient, ardent, ever-willing to do me service in every kind &#x02026; in regard to the Book <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi> &#x02026; his help was truly &#x02026; valuable (or <hi rend="italic">in</hi>valuable &#x02026;) he did all kinds of <hi rend="italic">excerpting</hi> and <hi rend="italic">abstracting</hi> &#x02026; as if I myself had done it;&#x02014;and, in brief, was an <hi rend="italic">alter-ego</hi> in all the deeper parts of that horrible immensity of drudgery. &#x02026; <supplied>[H]</supplied>e stood all my spurts of ill temper, &#x02003;c <hi rend="italic">with</hi>t once wincing; working like a patient hero for me, as if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had been nothing, I something, and as if it ennobled <hi rend="italic">his</hi> poor existence so to do!&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-04-3">3 April 1867</date>). In his journal TC tried to reciprocate by re-creating Neuberg&#x02019;s life separately from himself.</p>
<p>Adopting an approach similar to the one that he had used in the reminiscences, TC retold the story of Neuberg&#x02019;s life so that he could see it &#x0201C;in a diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> aspect now, and it surely ought to continue.&#x0201D; He sifted through the information that he had at hand, trying to catch a glimpse of Neuberg as an individual. TC admitted that &#x0201C;I never questioned him ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> his history; partly out of delicacy, tho&#x02019; I saw he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have told me.&#x0201D; But as he recited what he did know, a <pb id="pg-44-xxi" n="44:xxi"/>composite picture of Neuberg&#x02019;s personality began to emerge. Not quite able to transcend his own anti-Semitism, which had been inflamed by the behavior of the &#x0201C;Hebrew Conjurer&#x0201D; (&#x0201C;Shooting Niagara,&#x0201D; Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:11). Disraeli in securing passage of the Reform Bill, TC classified Neuberg as a &#x0201C;Jew of the <hi rend="italic">better</hi> type or almost of the best: a man of perfect integrity, of serious reflective temper, of fine and strong faculties (able to <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> anything presented to him), &#x02003; of many high aspirat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>.&#x0201D; Implicitly at least, TC seemed to appreciate that Neuberg, through his relentless exertions, had contradicted ubiquitou<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Victorian stereotypes about his ethnicity being acquisitive and devious by selflessly devoting himself to his cherished <hi rend="italic">&#x0201C;ideal</hi>&#x0201D;&#x02014;&#x0201C;the toiling at Fr<hi rend="italic">h</hi>.&#x0201D; His final project was a translation of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi>, &#x0201C;1&#x000BD; voll. of it &#x02026; still to do:&#x02014;a task he infinitely liked, and took far <hi rend="italic">too much pains ab</hi>t; as I often told him.&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Poor good Neuberg,&#x0201D; TC lamented, &#x0201C;far better to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> than I ever owned him as being!&#x0201D; In a startling admission, he confided to Lady Ashburton that Neuberg&#x02019;s death caused him almost as much heartache as JWC&#x02019;s: &#x0201C;[It] came upon me like a dull heavy weight; as a kind of corollary to that other, but with nothing of its poignancy; a dull broad blow following a stab into the heart; &#x02003; so remains with me&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-04-20">20 April 1867</date>).</p>
<p>Amidst the gloom, TC could draw some solace in honoring JWC by generously arranging to have the title deeds of the Craigenputtoch estate, which she had bequeathed to him in her will, given to the University of Edinburgh after his death. His purpose was to found bursaries for poor and deserving students, funded from the rents of the property. The gesture was at one with the goal of his memoir of JWC. He wished to locate her unique character and identity in the context of her Scottish ancestry, including its mythical dimension. In the bequest he noted that &#x0201C;Craigenputtock was, for many generations, the patrimony of a family named Welsh &#x02026; in series going back, think some, to the famous &#x02018;John Welsh,&#x02019; son-in-law of the Reformer, Knox.&#x0201D; Because she shared his name, TC decided to dedicate them to JWC&#x02019;s father, John Welsh, &#x0201C;the last such male heir in his family &#x02026; a highly honoured, widely regretted man.&#x0201D; Remembering his own course of study at Edinburgh, TC stipulated that five of the bursaries were to be given in mathematics, &#x0201C;above all in pure geometry,&#x0201D; and five for &#x0201C;the most excellent proficiency in matters classical.&#x0201D; He hoped that the plan, once implemented, would lend help &#x0201C;to the young heroic soul struggling for what is highest.&#x0201D; For him personally, the bequest was a &#x0201C;thread of pure water from the Scottish rocks, tinkling into its little basin by the thirsty wayside, for those whom it veritably belongs to&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s final bequest, <date when="1867-06-20">20 June 1867</date>). Symbolically, it was a living link to the vanished past of Haddington, Craigenputtoch, and Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Despite frequent bouts of melancholy, TC was eager to re-enter the public arena in order to address the prevalent &#x0201C;Signs of the Times.&#x0201D; Mass unemployment in the north of England and Scotland, railway failures and bank collapses, <pb id="pg-44-xxii" n="44:xxii"/>and the deterioration of domestic manufacture convinced him that the country was entering another and darker phase of &#x0201C;boom and bust.&#x0201D; Without success, he had urged Froude and Ruskin, <date when="1866-07">July 1866</date>, to launch a &#x0201C;Latter-Day Periodical&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 178; see also <ref target="volume-44/lt-18660721-TC-LLA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1866-07-21">21 July 1866</date>
</ref>) in order to assail the twin shibboleths of democracy and &#x0201C;political economy.&#x0201D; On <date when="1867-05-08">8 May 1867</date> he complained to Lady Ashburton: &#x0201C;Our &#x02018;trade&#x02019; is said to be all tumbled flat, this good while past; our &#x02018;railways threatened with bankruptcy,&#x02019; nearly every one of them visibly in spasm to weather that fatal cape; &#x02018;house-building&#x02019; <hi rend="italic">stopped</hi>, many people thrown out of work &#x02026; in short, <hi rend="italic">Mammon</hi> pulling the nose of his worshippers &#x02026; and great suffering and mutual accusat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in consequence. A good many people beginning to think it &#x02018;ominous,&#x02019; and that probably we are in a bad way! Courage, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is not the <hi rend="italic">end</hi>, my long-eared friends; tho&#x02019; that end will be here. <hi rend="italic">Apr&#x000E8;s nous le deluge</hi>!&#x0201D;</p>
<p>Ironically, TC&#x02019;s earlier exhortations to Ruskin to &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">bite</hi> very ardently&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-44/lt-18660802-TC-JAF-01">TC to JAF, <date when="1866-08-02">2 Aug. 1866</date>
</ref>) came back to &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">bite</hi>&#x0201D; him in May. In one of his <hi rend="italic">Time and Tide</hi> letters published in the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Examiner and Times</hi>, Ruskin reported the details of a conversation that he had with TC on <date when="1867-04-25">25 April 1867</date>. According to Ruskin, TC had told him that he &#x0201C;now cannot walk [in the streets of Chelsea, and of the whole district of London around it] without being insulted, chiefly because he is a grey, old man; and also because he is cleanly dressed&#x02014;these two conditions of him being wholly hostile, as the mob of the street feel, to their own instincts&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">(Ruskin&#x02019;s Works</hi> 27:480&#x02013;81). When an unidentified Rochdale man wrote to TC asking him whether he had indeed uttered these opinions, the response was terse and direct: &#x0201C;Sir&#x02014;the thing now &#x02018;going the rounds&#x02019; is untrue; diverges from the fact throughout &#x02026; an &#x02018;incredible &#x02026; thing&#x02019;&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-05-22">22 May 1867</date>). Six days later TC reiterated his position in a letter to the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>, dismissing Ruskin&#x02019;s paragraph as &#x0201C;erroneous, misfounded, superfluous, and even absurd.&#x0201D; Hurt and bewildered, Ruskin demanded that TC &#x0201C;either justify the terms of that letter in the Pallmall Gazette, or retract them, and that publicly&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-06-1">1 June 1867</date>). The affair escalated, with the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> making the dispute the subject of an editorial on <date when="1867-06-03">3 June</date>. TC replied to the paper on 8 June with a letter of semiretraction, explaining that he &#x0201C;substantially&#x0201D; agreed with Ruskin&#x02019;s opinion of the &#x0201C;the Populace or Canaille of London,&#x0201D; but distinguished this &#x0201C;non-human, or half-human&#x0201D; population from his own &#x0201C;harmless&#x0201D; London neighbors.</p>
<p>The quarrel was eventually defused, thanks mainly to Ruskin&#x02019;s magnanimity. The context of the original conversation tends to reinforce Charles Eliot Norton&#x02019;s statement in <date when="1869">1869</date> that Ruskin had transmitted TC&#x02019;s words accurately: &#x0201C;He <hi rend="italic">did</hi> say, so I heard from a person who was present when he said it, what Ruskin reported.&#x0201D; Memories of the humble population of Menton, which TC had described in his letter of 24 January to Forster as the &#x0201C;fine hardy honest-looking excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> brown people, the frugallest, civillest, and &#x02026; <pb id="pg-44-xxiii" n="44:xxiii"/>best poor people in the world,&#x0201D; were fresh in his mind. In such circumstances, it is highly probable that he did erupt in a diatribe against London&#x02019;s &#x0201C;canaille&#x0201D; in Ruskin&#x02019;s company. But like Froude, Ruskin was frequently misled by TC&#x02019;s mordant Scottish humor, and by his inveterate habit of engaging in cynical self-mockery. He invariably burst into hearty laughter after such outbursts, and as Norton added, he &#x0201C;likely forgot his words as soon as uttered, and &#x02026; had no intention that they should be taken <hi rend="italic">au pied de la lettre</hi>&#x0201D; (letter of <date when="1869-07-22">22 July 1869</date>; cited Cate 29). The poet and novelist Mary Boyle, who was staying at Menton during TC&#x02019;s visit and accompanied him &#x0201C;on walks and drives,&#x0201D; remembered how he &#x0201C;would launch forth into the most unwarrantable philippics, but then he would break off suddenly, and all the venom and bitterness be drowned in a burst of ringing laughter, and his handsome, though naturally grim, face would ripple all over with good-humoured smiles&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">(Mary Boyle, Her Book</hi>, ed. Sir Courtney Boyle [<date when="1901">1901</date>] 268).</p>
<p>Offended by Ruskin&#x02019;s tin-eared indiscretion, TC was slow to forgive him. In his journal he invoked JWC&#x02019;s judgment in support of his own: &#x0201C;A curious specimen, Ruskin, with really high and pretty talents in him, who has fluttered ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me (ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> us especially, while it was &#x02018;us&#x02019;!) with an exuberant, constant, and plainly excessive amiability of ways &#x02026; and was so taken by both of us,&#x02014;with clear insight that in regard to &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">affect</hi>n&#x02019; for <hi rend="italic">us</hi> it amounted to nothing. &#x02026; We always remarked, too, that his talk had no solidity, hugely lacked sincerity, trustfulness, ease; and was always flying off, on the deepest topics, into idle &#x02018;affect<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x02019; of scepticism, pococurantism &#x02003;c &#x02003;c, as if eager to hide ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and ashamed to be <hi rend="italic">seen</hi>. Pretty notions, pretty talents, sharp, arrowy utterances, and percept<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> and aspirat<hi rend="italic">tns</hi>, but all of a restless not of a quiet: of a weakish not a strong character;&#x02014;&#x02003; as central element, an immense pruriency of ambit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, what might have been called by us &#x02026; a merely great and transcen<hi rend="italic">dt vanity</hi>, if nothing else was &#x02018;great&#x02019;!&#x0201D; But perhaps recalling JWC&#x02019;s own droll humor, TC conceded that &#x0201C;I really can&#x02019;t be seriously angry at him, either&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-06-12">12 June 1867</date>). Like all of TC&#x02019;s friends and associates in this period, Ruskin discovered that friendship with &#x0201C;the man of genius&#x0201D; remained conditional on the approving voice of his dead wife.</p>

<bold>1866</bold>
<hi rend="italic">July.</hi> TC asks William Dods to supervise the installation of JWC&#x02019;s tombstone in Haddington (<date when="1866-07-02">2</date>). He acknowledges Friedrich Althaus&#x02019;s essay on his life (<date when="1866-07-12">12</date>), and sees Maria Price in Chelsea, giving her a London Library life ticket to commemorate JWC&#x02019;s birthday (<date when="1866-07-14">14</date>). He is glad to hear from Lady Ashburton, he tells her, and is thinking of accepting Miss Bromley&#x02019;s invitation to sea bathing on the south coast, as a preparation for &#x0201C;some &#x02018;kind of <hi rend="italic">work</hi>&#x02019; (if any real <hi rend="italic">work</hi> be possible)&#x0201D; (<date when="1866-07-21">21</date>). Ruskin, having returned from mainland Europe, visits. TC completes his reminiscences of JWC (<date when="1866-07-28">28</date>). TC reports to Forster that the Haddington arrangements for the tombstone for JWC are now complete, and he wishes to pay all the costs as quickly as possible (<date when="1866-07-29">29</date>). He asks for more copies of family photographs from Robert S. Tait (<date when="1866-07-30">30</date>). Though his brother James invites him to Scotsbrig, he would prefer no Scottish holiday this year (<date when="1866-07-30">30</date>).</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">August.</hi> TC begins an intermittent journal (<date when="1866-08-01">1</date>). David Laing visits Chelsea, and TC talks to Froude and to Ruskin. Despite a cold, TC goes to Ripple Court to stay with Miss Bromley for sea bathing (<date when="1866-08-13">13</date>&#x02013;<date when="1866-08-27">27</date>); two days later, Maggie Welsh leaves Chelsea for her brother&#x02019;s in Liverpool (<date when="1866-08-15">15</date>). Lady Ashburton visits Britain briefly. TC&#x02019;s health recovers slowly. He welcomes Joseph Neuberg&#x02019;s letter, having not heard from him for a long time (<date when="1866-08-23">23</date>). TC returns to a newly painted 5 Cheyne Row, and Neuberg visits in the evening (<date when="1866-08-27">27</date>). TC begins his support for Edward J. Eyre by presiding at the first Governor Eyre Defence Committee meeting (<date when="1866-08-29">29</date>).</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">September.</hi> TC tells Charles Kingsley of his vehement support for Eyre (<date when="1866-09-03">3</date>) and presides at the second Governor Eyre Defence Committee meeting (<date when="1866-09-05">5</date>). He cannot decide whether to accept Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s invitation to join her in Menton (<date when="1866-09-07">7</date>). A U.S. admirer, John Reuben Thompson, offers to send a gift of tobacco from Virginia (<date when="1866-09-12">12</date>). TC invites his nephew James Aitken Jr. to visit in Chelsea. He declines an invitation from the Kingsleys to visit (<date when="1866-09-17">17</date>) and one from Lady Lothian to dine (<date when="1866-09-25">25</date>). He remains active on the Governor Eyre question.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">October.</hi> TC decides against traveling to Menton for the present since cholera is reported there; Froude (<date when="1866-10-09">9</date>) and Ruskin (<date when="1866-10-10">10</date>) visit. He is, he tells Forster, &#x0201C;edging gradually to-wards some kind of light <hi rend="italic">work</hi>&#x0201D; (<date when="1866-10-15">15</date>). After a long silence, he writes cordially to his brother Alexander in Canada (<date when="1866-10-20">20</date>). He again asks Lady <pb id="pg-44-xxxvi" n="44:xxxvi"/>Ashburton for a postponement for his visit to Menton (<date when="1866-10-24">24</date>), since his &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">writing</hi>&#x0201D; (his reminiscences of Edward Irving) is still a month from completion.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">November.</hi> TC writes encouragingly to Eyre, disparaging the work of the Jamaica Committee, which attacks his actions (<date when="1866-11-01">1</date>). He thanks his brother John for taking care of Craigenputtoch business (<date when="1866-11-02">2</date>, <date when="1866-11-05">5</date>). He declines an invitation to lecture at Harrow School (<date when="1866-11-06">6</date>). He sends copies of Tait&#x02019;s photographs of the &#x0201C;Chelsea Interior&#x0201D; to relatives in Scotland. &#x0201C;I am really thinking of Mentone!&#x0201D; (<date when="1866-11-11">11</date>). He invites Anthony Sterling to ride with him one afternoon (<date when="1866-11-21">21</date>). He invites his sister Jean Aitken to visit in Chelsea, since he expects to finish his writing in early <date when="1866-12">December</date> (<date when="1866-11-01">26</date>). John Tyndall finally persuades him to go to Menton by promising to accompany him on the journey (<date when="1866-11-27">27</date>).</p>
<p>
 <hi rend="italic">December.</hi> The new lease for Craigenputtoch arrives in Chelsea (<date when="1866-12-03">3</date>). TC writes to Thomas Erskine, whose sister Christian Stirling has died (<date when="1866-12-05">5</date>). TC&#x02019;s sister Jean Aitken arrives from Scotland (<date when="1866-12-05">5</date>). TC tells Lady Ashburton he is prepared to set off for Menton on <date when="1866-12-18">18 December</date> with Tyndall. TC writes to his brother James about amendments that he wants made to the Craigenputtoch lease (<date when="1866-12-07">7</date>) and returns the lease itself to John A. Carlyle (<date when="1866-12-08">8</date>); he returns a manuscript to Emilie Venturi with the suggestion she send it to Froude for a reading (<date when="1866-12-13">13</date>). Finally TC settles on <date when="1866-12-21">21 December</date> for the journey with Tyndall, writes his farewell to Forster (<date when="1866-12-20">20</date>) and, helped by Tyndall and Jean, is ready for the road and rail. He leaves Jean in Chelsea to enjoy a London holiday; he writes to her from Menton (<date when="1866-12-24">24</date>) to say he has safely arrived and to James Aitken Jr. in London asking for a book and a waistcoat to be sent to Menton (<date when="1866-12-30">30</date>).</p>
 <p>
 <bold>1867</bold>
 <hi rend="italic">January.</hi> TC&#x02019;s nephew James Aitken Jr., sorting mail while TC is in Menton, forwards some letters and summarizes others; he reports a visit from Gerald Blunt and relays household news. He passes on a gift from TC of &#x000A3;5 to James Baillie, a relative of JWC&#x02019;s now living impoverished in Dover. London suffers from heavy snowfall. Tyndall, who escorted TC to Menton, returns to London; TC now takes walks, enjoying the scenery, the mild weather, and the company of Lady Ashburton and Frances and Emilia von Bunsen. Often gloomy in his journal entries, TC is writing the reminiscences of Jeffrey, Southey, and Wordsworth, &#x0201C;reawakening the sleep of the Past.&#x0201D; He asks his housekeeper, Sarah Warren, to bake and send some oatcakes; he admits to her &#x0201C;I might return back to you <hi rend="italic">a little</hi> stronger than I went&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-01-21">21</date>). Gladstone calls (<date when="1867-01-21">21</date>), en route to London from Italy. TC drives to Ventimiglia (<date when="1867-01-22">22</date>). Menton itself, he writes, is &#x0201C;curiously exotic&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-01-24">24</date>). TC catches up with his correspondence (<date>25</date>), sleeps better, and takes long walks in and around Menton. He writes to Maggie Welsh asking for Welsh family news (<date>26</date>), to Geraldine Jewsbury ([ca. <date>26</date>]), and to Emerson (<date>27</date>). He is finding Menton as &#x0201C;beautiful as a very picture&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-01-27">27</date>) but describes himself as &#x0201C;dismally <hi rend="italic">sad</hi>&#x0201D; (journal entry, <date when="1867-01-28">28</date>).</p>
<p><pb id="pg-44-xxxvii" n="44:xxxvii"/>
<hi rend="italic">February.</hi> Thomas Woolner reports seeing TC while passing through Menton, finding &#x0201C;the dear fellow in good spirits&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-02-09">9</date>); writing his brother John on the same day, TC explains his occasional low spirits are due to a troublesome corn on his little toe, now dealt with, allowing him a daily walk of two hours. He spends his evenings quietly with Lady Ashburton, reading and occasionally visiting English acquaintances, especially Lady Alford. James Aitken Jr. sends news from London, including of Neuberg&#x02019;s illness (<date when="1867-02-25">25</date>). TC writes to Neuberg, suggesting he, too, would benefit from the mild winter in Menton, and describing his pleasure in the scenery and his walks there (<date when="1867-02-10">10</date>). He enjoys the company and conversation of Baron von Sulzer, &#x0201C;serious, intellig<hi rend="italic">t</hi> young man.&#x0201D; He still is working on the reminiscences; he finishes Southey&#x02019;s, though it is only a &#x0201C;small (imaginary) Task&#x0201D; (<date>11</date>). Charlotte Sterling dies. TC writes to Ruskin of the pleasures of Menton&#x02019;s scenery and climate (<date>15</date>). Grace Welsh dies in Edinburgh (<date when="1867-02-15">15</date>). Pipes finally arrive from Chelsea, and Ruskin writes (<date when="1867-02-17">17</date>). TC receives letters from his brother John and sister Jean, and they pass on a letter from Alick in Canada; TC tells them of his sightseeing and begins to discuss his plans to return to Chelsea. Lady Ashburton wants him to accompany her to Italy, but TC declines (<date when="1867-02-09">18</date>). James Aitken Jr. continues to deal with TC&#x02019;s correspondence in Chelsea and send summaries to Menton (<date when="1867-02-20">20</date>). Lord Brownlow dies in Menton (<date when="1867-02-20">20</date>), and his mother, Lady Alford (&#x0201C;Lady A.&#x02019;s chief friend and resource in this place&#x0201D;), and brother leave for England to bury him. The weather breaks, and TC sends reports to Jean Aitken of his &#x0201C;dirty cold&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-02-24">24</date>).</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">March</hi>. Lord Northbrook writes TC (<date when="1867-03-02">2</date>) suggesting he would enjoy seeing Genoa if he accompanied Lady Ashburton there, but in his journal (<date when="1867-03-03">3</date>) TC writes of falling &#x0201C;into a sad abeyance&#x0201D; with his cold and general restlessness. He has been reading Shakespeare. Disliking the windy weather, he now plans to return to London around the middle of the month, accompanied by the Brownlows&#x02019; butler, Mr. Tweedie; he considers a break of journey in Vichy but rejects the idea. He hopes his brother John will come to Chelsea for a month&#x02019;s visit, &#x0201C;a kind of light amid the gloom of my arrival&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-03-04">4</date>), and John replies, &#x0201C;I will cheerfully meet you in London&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-03-08">8</date>). Caroline Fox visits TC in Menton; Lady Ashburton, with little warning, leaves for Florence and Rome (leaving her daughter behind in Menton) which settles TC&#x02019;s mind on departure. Sulzer helps him with train timetables, which TC always finds very hard to understand (<date when="1867-03-02">10</date>). John Forster writes from London where he has been hand­ling TC&#x02019;s publishing affairs (<date when="1867-03-09">9</date>). Neuberg, who has been very ill, thanks TC for his letter, which &#x0201C;came to me like a blessed voice from Upper World&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-03-11">11</date>). TC leaves Menton with Mr. Tweedie by train with an overnight stop in Avignon (<date when="1867-03-14">14</date>); he then stops at Lyon and Paris (<date when="1867-03-15">15</date>), and Amiens and Boulogne, crossing the English Channel and arriving in Chelsea just after midnight (<date when="1867-03-16">16</date>). The <pb id="pg-44-xxxviii" n="44:xxxviii"/>Household Suffrage Bill begins (<date when="1867-03-18">18</date>) its long progress through the House of Commons (passed <date when="1867-07-15">15 July</date>). TC writes to Mary Boyle and asks her to thank the Brownlows for the services of Mr. Tweedie, &#x0201C;worth ten Couriers to me&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-03-20">20</date>). Neuberg dies (<date when="1867-03-22">22</date>), his translation of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> unfinished. Robert S. Tait visits Chelsea with this news (<date when="1867-03-26">26</date>) and accompanies TC and John A. Carlyle to the funeral (<date when="1867-03-27">27</date>). &#x0201C;Poor good Neuberg; far better to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> than I ever owned him as being!&#x0201D; Lady Amberley visits (<date>27</date>).</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">April.</hi> TC writes to Erskine on the death of his sister David Paterson (<date when="1867-04-23">23</date>), remembering his visit to Erskine in Edinburgh in <date when="1866-04">April 1866</date> (<date when="1867-04-23">1</date>). Lady Ashburton writes from Italy to say she will be in Addiscombe by <date when="1867-06">June</date> at the latest (<date when="1867-04-06">6</date>); in fact she does not arrive until <date when="1867-10">October</date>. In Chelsea TC keeps very quiet, visiting only Froude and Forster. Ruskin visits (<date when="1867-04-10">10</date>). TC commissions a bust of Neuberg for his sister Rosetta Frankau ([<date when="1867-04-11">11</date>]); Lady Ashburton writes from Menton to sympathize (<date when="1867-04-17">17</date>), and TC replies despondently as the anniversary of JWC&#x02019;s death approaches (<date when="1867-04-20">20</date>). Ruskin is publishing his letters to a working man on the laws of work; TC writes that once the Reform Bill is passed, &#x0201C;thank Heaven, we shall have done with it then!&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-04-20">20</date>). Lady Ashburton invites TC to Vichy to join her (<date when="1867-04-26">26</date>). TC calls on Rosetta Frankau (<date when="1867-04-29">29</date>). John A. Carlyle leaves for Edinburgh (<date when="1867-04-29">29</date>).</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">May.</hi> TC declines an invitation to dine with Lady Amberley, though he says she would be welcome in Chelsea anytime (<date when="1867-05-03">3</date>). Bankruptcies and bank failures are widely reported. TC declines Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s invitation to Vichy (<date when="1867-05-03">8</date>). He visits Tyndall, but generally avoids &#x0201C;calls.&#x0201D; Reform agitation continues. TC complains of the heat, which affects both his sleep and his digestion. Brother James and his son James Carlyle Jr. arrange to manage the repairs of Craigenputtoch on TC&#x02019;s behalf, in preparation for taking on the lease (<date when="1867-05-11">11</date>); with John A. Carlyle&#x02019;s and David Masson&#x02019;s help, TC prepares the bequest of Craigenputtoch to Edinburgh University to fund student bursaries (<date when="1867-05-12">12</date>).

<salute>Dear Maccall,</salute>
<p>There was instant diligence used in regard to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Two <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi>. Within a week, Miss Jewsbury, I recollect, had reported as to both,&#x02014;unfavourably, indeed almost hopelessly; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, from so experienced a <hi rend="italic">Taster</hi>, was to be taken as an ill symptom.</p>
<p>Carefully <hi rend="italic">ignoring</hi> that, we directly thereupon sent y<hi rend="italic">r Mss</hi> to Fred<hi rend="italic">c</hi> Chapman (193 Piccadilly), instructing him to have them examined <hi rend="italic">quàm primùm</hi> [as soon as possible], and then to communicate with you (address, &#x0201C;Bexley Heath&#x0201D;); wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he promised punctually to do. Since that, inquiries (to my knowledge) have been <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> made; and the gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> result was, I understood, many months ago, that the <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi>. were ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> safe in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> hands. The <hi rend="italic">un</hi>punctuality of Fr<hi rend="italic">c</hi> and his people discloses itself here,&#x02014;not by any means for the <hi rend="italic">first</hi>

<p>I am grieved to hear of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> continued difficulties and ever-recurring disappoint<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>.

  <salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Braid</salute>

<salute>Dear Madam</salute>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle has asked me to write a few lines to you to say that he begs you will accept of this very small remembrance of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle. It is but a very trifling offering, but M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle says he feels sure you will value it for the sake of one who was for so many years a loving friend. My dear Cousin&#x02019;s death was a very great shock to us all, for in spite of great feebleness &#x02003; weakness for some time past, she was so cheerful &#x02003; bright that those around her had fain hoped she might be spared to her poor husband, &#x02003; to others who loved her dearly, for some years to come. It is indeed a terrible blow to him; for after nearly forty years of this life&#x02019;s pilgrimage together, it must indeed seem a dreary life now without the one constant companion. As you will see the boa &#x02003; little cuffs have been <hi rend="italic">often</hi> worn by her,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Possibly the boa and fur cuffs that JWC bought in <date when="1846">1846</date>; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461107-JWC-HW-01"><sic>21:86</sic><corr>JWC to HW, [<date when="1846-11-07">7 Nov. 1846</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> but I feel sure that <hi rend="italic">that</hi> will only perhaps make them of more value in your eyes.</p>

<salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>I have made some attempts to inquire into y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> case;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Rev. Henry Suckling divorced his wife on grounds of adultery, <date when="1861">1861</date>, and remarried <date when="1862">1862</date>. It is likely that their two children, Charles (b. <date when="1850">1850</date>) and Alfred Edward (b. <date when="1851">1851</date>), lived with him and that Mrs. Suckling was indigent. He had been curate of Shrivenham, Berkshire, <date when="1858">1858</date>&#x02013;<date when="1862">62</date>, and moved to the curacy of Reepham, Norfolk, <date when="1862">1862</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872">72</date>.</note> but hitherto with no result whatever;&#x02014;and indeed I am myself, at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, so involved in sorrowful employments and considerat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, I have in effect no power to investigate things extraneous.</p>
<p>On reflexion, and by guessing from y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> style, manner &#x02003;c, I conclude to send <pb id="pg-44-6" n="44:6"/>you a small but well-meant remittance (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is here inclosed),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC recorded in his checkbook: &#x0201C;<date when="1866-07-10">10 july 1866</date> / to Mrs Suckling (Curate&#x02019;s Wife<hi rend="italic">&#x02014;Charity</hi>) &#x000A3;5 .. 0 .. 0&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).

Carlyle</name><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Between <date when="1866-07">7</date> and <date when="1866-07-10">10 July</date> TC was both writing his reminiscences of JWC (&#x0201C;Maggie Welsh, now here with me, has <hi rend="italic">helped</hi> in adjusting into clearness the recollection of all this&#x0201D;) and finding and sorting some of JWC&#x02019;s letters: &#x0201C;(Sunday, <date when="1866-07-08">july 8</date>; began writing again, at the <hi rend="italic">second line</hi> of this page; the intermediate time has been spent in a strenuous search for, and collection of all her Letters now discoverable (by Maggie Welsh and me). &#x02026; They are exceedingly difficult to arrange; not having in general any <hi rend="italic">date</hi>; so that <hi rend="italic">place</hi> often enough, and day and even <hi rend="italic">year</hi> throughout, are mainly to be got by the Post Office Stamp, supported by inference and inquiry such as is still possible, at least to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.) / The whole of yesterday I spent in reading and arranging the Letters of <date when="1857">1857</date>; such a day&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> as I perhaps never had in my life before. What a piercing radiancy of meaning to me in those dear records, hastily thrown off, full of misery, yet of bright eternal love; all as if on wings of lightning, tingling through one&#x02019;s very heart of hearts! Oh, I was blind not to see how <hi rend="italic">brittle</hi> was that thread of noble celestial (almost more than terrestrial) life; how <hi rend="italic">much</hi> it was all in all to me, and how <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> it should long be left with me. Her <hi rend="italic">sufferings</hi> seem little short of those in an hospital fever-ward, as she painfully drags herself about; and yet constantly there is such an electric shower of all-illuminating brilliancy, penetration, recognition, wise discernment, just enthusiasm, humour, grace, patience, courage, love,&#x02014;and in fine of spontaneous <hi rend="italic">nobleness</hi> of mind and intellect,&#x02014;as I know not where to parallel! I have asked myself, Ought all this to be lost, or kept to myself, and the brief time that now belongs to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>? Can <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> of it be saved, then, for the worthy that still remain among these roaring myriads of profane unworthy?&#x02014; I really must consider it further; and already I feel it to have become uncertain to me whether at least this poor Notebook <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> ere my decease or left to its chances among my survivors?&#x02014;&#x02014; As to &#x02018;talent,&#x02019; epistolary and other, these <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, I perceive, equal and surpass whatever of best I know to exist in that kind; for &#x02018;talent,&#x02019; &#x02018;genius,&#x02019; or whatever we may call it, what an evidence, if my little woman needed that to me! &#x02026; Ah me, ah me!&#x02014; &#x02014; At least, I have tied up that Bundle (the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> letters touching on <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi> have a paper round them; the first written in Edinburgh, it appears <hi rend="italic">now</hi>!)

Althaus noted later that on receipt of the article, &#x0201C;even Carlyle himself wrote me a friendly letter of acknowledgment&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">(Two Reminiscences</hi> 5). Althaus had prepared the article with the assistance of Joseph Neuberg and recalled: &#x0201C;There was no lack of biographical notices and scattered facts, yet all in all these were extremely unsatisfactory; especially for the beginnings of his career were the dates full of gaps. Finally I had to turn to Carlyle himself with a series of questions, but in this received no reply.&#x0201D; He was then introduced to Neuberg; &#x0201C;Neuberg could enlighten me immediately on many doubtful points; on others he too was uncertain, but kindly and readily promised to make enquiries of Carlyle himself&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Two Reminiscences</hi> 4).</note></p>

 seems quite right; and I am perfectly ready to put down my name as the first signature,&#x02014;provided this be, by those that understand such matters, considered the fit course. But Mr Forster, who alone of my circle c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give a judgement ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it, is not here,&#x02014;still absent in Yorkshire for a few days.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">John Forster&#x02019;s work as a Lunacy Commissioner took him traveling around the country.</note>
 Add to wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, that there is not the least hurry necessary; as nothing whatever can be done in the affair at present,&#x02014;the Pensions for this year being completely settled, and the time of settlement for those of next year being certainly still a good way off.

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came with beautiful promptitude, directly on y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> receiving mine;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC&#x02019;s letter untraced; Lady Ashburton wrote, <date when="1866-06-18">18 June</date>, when she had not heard from him; apparently letters to and from the Continent often went astray.</note>
 and was a great satisfact<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to me. How fortunate that Vichy was so beneficent to the little Mary and you, after all those painful roamings!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lady Ashburton had been traveling in Europe since <date when="1865-07">July 1865</date>, and was currently in Vichy, spa town, central France; Lady Ashburton wrote of Vichy, <date when="1866-06-18">18 June</date>: &#x0201C;Here we have now been a month&#x02014;&#x02003; &#x02026; I am better than I have been for many a long day, owing to these wonderful waters&#x02014;&#x02003; little Mary too, is perfectly well.&#x0201D; Mary Florence Baring was Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s da.</note>
 That is something achieved. To be free of bodily misery is always a mighty blessing;&#x02014;tho&#x02019; there remain plenty of other kinds, these are always more handsomely manageable: one is never fairly or <hi rend="italic">degradingly</hi> wretched till one&#x02019;s miserable clay house too begins to smoke and take-in wet! I have since seen y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Dr Frank,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Dr. Philip Frank; Lady Ashburton wrote, <date when="1866-06-18">18 June</date>: &#x0201C;Dr Frank is a Man, who I think you would like&#x02014; He was brought up in Germany&#x02014;&#x02003; is full of original, &#x02003; good thought&#x02014;if you care to hear last tidings of us, he will call, at your door.&#x0201D;</note>
 who seemed to me a very intelligent young man: he confirmed all you said of Self &#x02003; Mary; talked of writing to you in the course of a day,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Dr. Frank wrote to Lady Ashburton, [<date when="1866-07-17">17 July 1866</date>]: &#x0201C;I went on Friday to see Carlyle&#x02014; Thanks to your kind words on my behalf and the news of which I was the bearer, the great thinker actually received me. He was really in a genial mood; gentle&#x02014;calm, but energetic withal in all his statements &#x02003; full of vigor. He spoke with great affection of you &#x02026; the fine temper of your heart and the warm impulsiveness of your nature; &#x02003; how he wished you to roam no more but to take root with Mary in a home of your own, ceasing to be a rolling stone in foreign lands&#x02014; And then he talked very wisely about dear little Mary, how desirable it was for her too to be settled; &#x02003; thinking that the too varied &#x02003; numerous impressions inseparable from continual change might tend to tax the young growing brain of the child beyond its strength&#x02014;before its time. &#x02026; <supplied>[O]</supplied>f course I did not stay long &#x02003; went away with many messages for you in case I should be writing before he himself might be able to do so&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note>&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has encouraged, or partly <hi rend="italic">induced</hi>, this delay, on my part, of doing so.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got James&#x02019;s Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Presumably from James Carlyle Jr.</note>
 last week; and was much obliged and gratified by y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kind invitat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. Scotsbrig is still as it were a kind of <hi rend="italic">home</hi> of mine; and I always assure myself of a brotherly welcome there, while I continue in this world wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> grows more and more foreign and solitary to me. For the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> year, I have felt that I must avoid Scotland; and even that I ought to [stay] as strictly as possible at home, and there sit quiet, and bethink me still farther what it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> that has befallen. Except one fortnight of sea-bathing, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is to be in the latter half of Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> coming, in a kind and most quiet friend&#x02019;s house (not far from Dover) ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 60 miles off,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Caroline Davenport Bromley&#x02019;s house, Ripple Court, Kent, was about 5 mi. (8 km.) NNE of Dover, which was about 78 mi. (125 km.) by rail from London.</note>&#x02014;I do not contemplate any travelling this year.</p>
<p>We were, the Doctor &#x02003; I, disagreeably struck with what James&#x02019;s says ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a lingering cold you have got. That is a very bad, wearisome and even dangerous neighbour; of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you ought to be more cautious than you are. Quite unsafe and improper to heat y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self with work, and then to sit carelessly cooling! <hi rend="italic">Nobody</hi> can stand that without risk of damage; and you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> absolutely <hi rend="italic">never do it</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a rule I myself observe, quite strictly,&#x02014;soon punished, if I don&#x02019;t!) You must have got mischief, too, out of the unroofing of the house, &#x02003;c,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am glad to hear is now nearly over.</p>
<p>The Doctor came back to us from Jersey,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A. Carlyle had been attending the marriage of his stepson William Watt; see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18660714-MW-WDO-01">

It is possible he may be with you the very day you read this,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; probably the next day (Wednesday, with some warning to you) may be what he fixes. I expect to hear a precise acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Jean&#x02019;s health &#x02003; yours with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> loss of a post on his part.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>All things considered, I vote that you are right in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> determinat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. Having got harnessed to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Enterprise, in that gradual, intricate and at length complete manner, you cannot, with any propriety (even if you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> at all, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is doubtful), cut y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self loose from it,&#x02014;especially now when it is at the starting, and all things, y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own mind included, are elaborately ready.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Charles A. Ward had written, <date when="1866-07-09">9 July</date>: &#x0201C;Another week and I have not been able to get to you. Sometimes so thoroughly spent towards night that I have turned into bed at 8 o&#x02019;clock for though I sell stimulants I do not use them. I hold there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> genuine restorer but sleep &#x02003; no fluid harmless but water&#x02014;&#x02003; the nearer to content a man can rest in that the more nearly shall his pulse beat in gay unison to the music of health. &#x02026; Not a night have I not thought of you &#x02003; the considerate &#x02003; gentle kindness of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle in coming in to bid a pleasant welcome when last I came to sturdy well built no 5. I am terribly tested.&#x0201D; He then wrote again, <date when="1866-07-29">29 July</date>, about the conflict he felt between continuing in his business as a wine merchant in order to make money or in pursuing his writing with little hope of monetary reward; TC had apparently been in touch with him recently: &#x0201C;One whole week has now gone by since you were good enough to put in a protest against what appears to you in me to be a too great Mammon worship. &#x02026; First it is my mother&#x02019;s life wish next it is and has been ever my own most sorrowful detestation. &#x02026; Nay, even an old word of your own has helped it, &#x02018;I do not advise you to put your blessedness in literature.&#x02019;&#x0201D; Ward had several times sent TC copies of his articles (see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600924-TC-CAW-01"><sic>36:262&#x02013;64</sic><corr>TC to CAW, <date when="1860-09-24">24 Sept. 1860</date></corr></ref>), and TC had suggested magazines where he might send them (see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640218-MW-LLA-01"><sic>40:15</sic><corr>MW to LLA, [<date when="1864-02-18">18 Feb. 1864</date>]</corr></ref>); he now appeared to have committed himself to moneymaking, in the hope that when he had enough he might then have time for writing: &#x0201C;I do not value the money, God knows full well, but I see that I can do nothing without it. / The question of questions is what time will there be when the money&#x02019;s gotten? &#x02026; I have thought <hi rend="italic">long</hi> about it &#x02003; have chosen the long <hi rend="italic">dark</hi> road. &#x02026; If life is too short for a resolute prudence I did not make life &#x02003; am ready to yield it up and all its plans.</note> go on, therefore, <pb id="pg-44-21" n="44:21"/><hi rend="italic">Fausto pede</hi> [with lucky feet]; with all your skill and energy, and patient vigilance and courage, and whatever virtues are in you. Especially with nobleness, spotless integrity; the full possess<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> moral self, to be striven for as the height of the prize!&#x02014;</p>
<p>In any lawful Enterprise, prosecuted on these principles, a man &#x0201C;cultivates&#x0201D; himself daily and hourly, in all manner of ways, and may hope to come out <hi rend="italic">educated</hi> so as, <hi rend="italic">except</hi> in the School of Experience, he c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> nowhere be. And far beyond all Colleges, and readings and tutorings, that irrefragable old Gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, E<hi rend="small-caps">xperience</hi>, is capable of teaching the wise soul that will listen to him. At the close of the adventure, therefore, you may hope to have <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, if not so many <hi rend="italic">Books</hi> as some have done, yet a great many other things, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are much more didactic. Upon many or all of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, the world may still benefit by y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> opin<hi rend="italic">n</hi>;&#x02014;and this is a fact, I think, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, whatever course and issue y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> adventure take, you ought at no time to leave out of view. Keep that sacredly with you all along, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say; as the Israelites did with their Ark, in that terrible Pilgrimage <hi rend="italic">they</hi> had thro&#x02019; the thirsty wildernesses of this world.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">See Exod.</note></p>
<p>On the whole, I have long since discerned for myself, and held to the convic<hi rend="italic">n</hi> as firmly as I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, that, in all undertakings whatsoever, a man, at the last strict balance of accounts, will find he has got, out of the undertaking, just what amount of <hi rend="small-caps">good</hi> he himself managed to <hi rend="italic">put it into it</hi>. Just so much, I always think,&#x02014;if he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> count &#x0201C;good&#x0201D; in contradistinct<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to nuggets, celebrat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> &#x02003;c &#x02003;c;&#x02014;no more, but also no less. This is all I had to say at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Ward replied, <date when="1866-08-01">1 Aug.</date>: <hi rend="italic">&#x0201C;very</hi> doubtful would the issue be of anything else than that which your most wise &#x02003; well considered letter now advises That I take to determinates. / It is to me a horrid &#x02003; detestable determination that is clenched to night &#x02003; for hope formularised for the first time. &#x02026; They say you must love to succeed in a thing. I believe as much good profit may be got out of hating provided it be intense enough, &#x02003; mine has been somewhat vigorous towards this particular thing in its time, though now flowing drubbed and silent. / As for the enterprise I am upon I do not look to find any solid pleasure in it, even with the best good speed attending. For a long time I have felt as one who has bidden farewell to pleasure, &#x02003; the truer that feeling proves the happier in a certain sense am I, the less my own <hi rend="italic">will</hi> tempts the easier tis to walk by the lantern of the &#x02018;ought to be.&#x02019;&#x0201D;</note></p>

After the battaile the bodie of the said king being founde, was closed in lead, and conveyed from thence to London, and so to the Monasterie of Sheyne in Surrey, where it remained for a time, in what order I am not certaine: but since the dissolution of that house, in the raigne of Edward the sixt, Henry Gray, Duke of Suffolke, being lodged, and keeping house there: I have beene sheined the same bodie so lapped in lead, close to the head and bodie, throwne into a waste roome amongst the old timber, leade, and other rubble&#x0201D; (Stow, <hi rend="italic">Survey of London</hi> 238).</note> saw in the Ex-Monastery of East Sheen.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss">A priory for Carthusian monks was founded, <date when="1414">1414</date>, in Sheen, Richmond; it was dissolved, <date when="1539">1539</date>, during the reign of Henry VIII.</note><hi rend="italic">And</hi> beard was sticking thro&#x02019; the lead there;&#x02014;and in the Picture at Taymouth, I think the beard is <hi rend="italic">black</hi>.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss">In two letters to David Laing, <date when="1854">1854</date>, in which TC discussed the possible setting up of an exhibition of Scottish Historical Portraits, he recommended the inclusion of the portrait of James IV then to be found at Taymouth Castle, Perth; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540502-TC-DL-01"><sic>29:81</sic><corr>TC to DL, <date when="1854-05-02">2 May 1854</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540503-TC-DL-01">87<corr>TC to DL, <date when="1854-03-03">3 May 1854</date></corr></ref>. However most of the contents of Taymouth Castle were sold in the early 20th century, and the portrait is untraced. There is one portrait of James in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh, and several in the National Portrait Gallery, London, but in all of them James is clean shaven.</note> Laing has little belief in that or any of the Pictures, thinks them all <hi rend="italic">copies</hi> &#x02003;c, &#x02003;c. But it is possible Bergenroth&#x02019;s Spaniard may give us the beard&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">colour</hi> as well; and thereby might <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> to contradict the too shocking story in Stowe.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss">Stow continued: &#x0201C;Since the which time workemen there for their foolish pleasure, hewed off his head: and Launcelot Young at this present mayster Glazier to her Majestie, feeling a sweet savour to come from thence, and seeing the same dryed from all moisture, and yet the forme remayning, with the hayre of the heade, and beard red, brought it to London to his house in Woodstreet, where for a time he kept it for the sweetnesse, but in the end caused the Sexton of that church to burie it amongst other bones, taken out of their charnell, &#x02003;c.&#x0201D; (Stow, <hi rend="italic">Survey of London</hi> 238). Presumably the hair of both head and beard had continued to grow for a while after death.</note> For, it seems (as my K&#x000F6;hler reminds me), there were no fewer than 12 or 11 <hi rend="italic">other</hi> persons all dressed out like the King before the Battle opened; and the last thing that was testified to of James was that his Page <hi rend="italic">saw him</hi> ride across the Tweed at nightfall, and vanish in the darkness over there.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss">There were many stories as to what became of James IV after the battle, including that there were several men dressed like the king, both to confuse the enemy and to prevent the soldiers despairing if they saw the king slain; that the king was seen crossing the river Tweed, the border between Scotland and England; and that he was seen on the evening after the battle in Kelso, and then went on pilgrimage; see Norman MacDougall, <hi rend="italic">James IV</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1989">1989</date>) 298&#x02013;300.</note> So that <pb id="pg-44-26" n="44:26"/>it must have been one of the false Eleven that the English go<supplied>[t]</supplied>, and carried home in a sack <hi rend="italic">(proh pudor</hi> [for shame]!)&#x02014; It also appears the English made no <hi rend="italic">chase</hi> at Flodden; and didn&#x02019;t know till next morning that the victory (<hi rend="italic">talis qualis</hi> [of such kind]) was theirs.</p>
<p>On the whole, I think <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had better take up James yourself, and let us see clearly both about him and his famed lamentable <hi rend="italic">Flodden</hi>,&#x02014;concerning which latter, I am told, a capital Book, fruit of long study &#x02003; inspection, by the now Parson of that Parish in Northumberland&#x02014;Book<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss">Robert Jones, <hi rend="italic">The Battle of Flodden Field, Fought September 9, 1513</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1864">1864</date>); Rev.

<salute>Dear Lady Anna,</salute>
<p>I return many thanks for the Photograph;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Apparently a photograph of a portrait that Lady Stirling Maxwell believed to be of her ancestor, Alexander Leslie (see n.2).</note> and really feel much obliged by y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> great kindness in calling here the other day to leave it for me,&#x02014;when I was so unfortunate as not to see you.</p>
<p>The Photograph is excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi>; and represents an able and effective-looking man: but I had, at the first glance, and still have, my grave doubts of its meaning really that &#x0201C;excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> little crooked Feldmarshall&#x0201D; (as Covenanter Baillie lovingly designates him) who became &#x0201C;first Earl of Leven,&#x0201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Robert Baillie (<date when="1602">1602</date>&#x02013;<date when="1662">62</date>; <ref target="volume-44/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1067"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), minister and author; Alexander Leslie (ca. <date when="1580">1580</date>&#x02013;<date when="1661">1661</date>; <ref target="volume-44/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16482"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 1st earl of Leven, soldier; in the Swedish <date when="1608-army">army 1608</date>&#x02013;<date when="1638">38</date>; leader, <date when="1638">1638</date>&#x02013;<date when="1649">49</date>, of the Covenanter army against Charles I (<date when="1600">1600</date>&#x02013;<date when="1649">1649</date>; <ref target="volume-44/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5143"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), king of England, Scotland, and Ireland; later he supported the restoration of Charles II (<date when="1636">1636</date>&#x02013;<date when="1685">85</date>; <ref target="volume-44/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5144"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>

In his essay &#x0201C;Baillie the Covenanter&#x0201D; (<date when="1842">1842</date>) TC quotes Baillie describing Leslie as that &#x0201C;old little crooked soldier&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:239). Lady Stirling Maxwell was a direct descendent of Alexander Leslie. See also <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410402-TC-DL-01">

<p>In the first place, this figure is that of a fattish stout and rather big man. Secondly, he is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in armour, as a distinguished soldier in that time sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been.

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>&#x02014;I go off on Monday, by the 12 o&#x02019;clock train (Victoria stat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; am to arrive at Dover, 4.30, and be driven for <hi rend="italic">an hour</hi> thereafter;&#x02014;&#x0201C;home,&#x0201D; therefore, a while before <hi rend="italic">six</hi>).

Perhaps the worst is, I have caught in the late blustery damp time, a perceptible snatch of <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> however seems to be abating); and I am slightly below par in point of health, tho&#x02019; not so bad as you often enough saw me last summer.

He smoothed back my hair and kissed me on the forehead and made me feel very proud of myself, saying,&#x02014;&#x02018;I don&#x02019;t know your intended husband, Jessie, but you&#x02019;ll get a good husband if he&#x02019;s as clever a man as the wife he&#x02019;s getting is a woman.

<salute>My dear Brother</salute>,&#x02014;I got y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kind Note this morning, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was very kind indeed, as well as Jean&#x02019;s; and much obliged to both of you.</p>
<p>I arrived here, safe and <hi rend="italic">less</hi> unhappy much than I might have been, about an hour ago (4 p.m. was the time; Dover <hi rend="italic">was</hi> at 3 p.m. as you said,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A.

<salute>Dear Procter,</salute>
<p>I have been reading your book on Charles Lamb,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">B. W. Procter, <hi rend="italic">Charles Lamb: A Memoir</hi> (<date when="1866">1866</date>); the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1866-08-11">11 Aug.</date>, described it as &#x0201C;one of the good books of our time, a charming addition to the province of biography in English literature.&#x0201D;</note>
 in the solitary silent regions whither I had fled for a few days of dialogue with Mother Earth and her elements, and I have found in your work something so touching, brave, serene, and pious, that I cannot but write you one brief word of recognition,&#x02014;which I know you will receive with welcome; all the more as I especially <hi rend="italic">forbid</hi> you to bother yourself with answering it.</p>
<p>Brevity, perspicuity, graceful clearness: Then also perfect veracity, gentleness, lovingkindness, justness, peaceable candour throughout, a fine kindly sincerity to all comers, with sharp enough insight too, quick recognition graphically rendered&#x02014;all the qualities, in short which such a book could have. I find visible in this, now dating, it appears, in your seventy&#x02013;seventh year<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Procter apparently thought himself two years younger than he was; Samuel Ralph Townshend Mayer (<date when="1841">1841</date>&#x02013;<date when="1880">80</date>; <ref target="volume-44/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18429">

<p>No answer to this; I already forbade you. Take it as an interjection; written merely for solace of my own poor heart. And so, good be with you, dear old friend.&#x02014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter with the <hi rend="italic">salutary</hi> inclosure,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC asked John A. Carlyle for a prescription for hop pills to be sent direct to Charles Quiller, the pharmacist in Chelsea; see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18660816-TC-JAC-01">
<corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1866-08-16">16 Aug.</date></corr></ref>; perhaps Quiller sent the pills to John for forwarding.</note> on Sunday morning (we have only one Mail here); and could not but thank you for such industry and promptitude on my behalf. Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> readiness and eagerness at all times to be of help to me,&#x02014;this, you may depend on it, is a thing I am always well aware of, at the bottom of all my impatiences and discontents. Jean&#x02019;s Note came yesterday morning, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was also a kindness to me, and was welcome reading in the silence of the early fields.</p>
<p>I am now better than when I wrote last; and calculate on finishing my term here, on supportable terms; but look forward to Monday night &#x02003; my own bed ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> as still the desirable haven. Miss Bromley&#x02019;s hospitable kindness and politeness towards me are beyond all bounds: yesterday, for instance, in spite of all I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say, she overset her whole household arrang<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for me,&#x02014;insisting she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> herself dine <hi rend="italic">with</hi> me &#x0201C;at 3 p.m.&#x0201D; (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was highly unnecessary), and did so, and will continue to do it most likely while I remain; dining on Monday, for the first time ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, at 8!&#x02014; I did sleep last night better than I have ever done hitherto, tho&#x02019; still not quite eminently well. The place is beautifully silent, but <pb id="pg-44-40" n="44:40"/><pb id="pg-44-41" n="44:41"/>also vacant to me; and has a character of <hi rend="italic">Hades</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is the complex<hi rend="italic">n</hi> my own tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> generally have.</p>
<p>Lady Ashburton has <hi rend="italic">come</hi> from Switzerland, and has also gone;&#x02014;back at Lüzern<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lucerne; see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18660816-TC-LLA-01"><corr>TC to LLA, <date when="1866-08-08">8 Aug.</date></corr></ref></note> this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, if the program have held! She had some sudden call hither; and is a sudden creature: monday night last ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 11 p.m. Miss Bromley &#x02003; I saw her into the Calais Steamer, embarking in a tempest of discordant hurries. I had seen her for an hour in London; &#x02003; she shot across hither and staid over sunday &#x02003; monday, very communicative especially to me.</p>
<p>One of her grand projects was that I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come to Mentone, and stay with her thro&#x02019; the winter, till May next, <hi rend="italic">when</hi> finally she <hi rend="italic">is</hi> coming home. Excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> quiet place, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> house,&#x02014;rooms methods, times all to oneself; beautiful &#x0201C;Society&#x0201D; too; in short it was all beautiful, and the poor Lady&#x02019;s heart seemed to be set on it; so that I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> see it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give <hi rend="italic">her</hi> much pleasure that I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> consent. She even engaged volunteered to ask Maggy Welsh too, who sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> screen me and <hi rend="italic">pad</hi> everything into softness for me in the new scene, &#x0201C;Oh it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be so beautiful,&#x0201D;&#x02014;nay I had even to <hi rend="italic">forbid</hi> her from writing at once to Maggy by way of <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> me! At first, &#x02003; while she was talking, the thing had some plausibility; and I did not say absolutely no, but w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> consider: now, however, my tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> left to themselves seem to go quite the other way; and I <hi rend="italic">scunner</hi> not at the horrible 30 hours of steam jangle, but at all the other novelties &#x02003; incongruities. I must give it a serious considerat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, however; and ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> No (as I imagine it must be No) not unwisely but after real deliberat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. Think you of it, endeavour to compute everything; and tell me seriously. On Monday <hi rend="italic">night</hi>, if you hear nothing to the contrary consider <hi rend="italic">Chelsea</hi> my Address ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.&#x02014; What a touching little bit of <hi rend="italic">fly-leaf</hi> from Haddington Churchyard<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Possibly the title page of James Miller, <hi rend="italic">The Lamp of Lothian; or, the History of Haddington</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1844">1844</date>) with its drawing of St. Mary&#x02019;s Church from the river; see above; more probably an unidentified, more recent, pamphlet or leaflet.</note> that was that you sent! Ah me, the whole world&#x02019;s history has shrunk to me now into that!</p>

<p>Your letter of this morning is one of the pleasantest I have had for a long time: I am very glad to know you at hand again, for I have not so much as known your address all this while,&#x02014;and this is itself a pleasure which I had even from the outside of your letter.

That Germany is to stand on her feet henceforth, and not be dismembered on the highway; but face all manner of Napoleons and hungry, sponging dogs, with clear steel in her hand, and an honest purpose in her heart&#x02014;this seems to me the best news we or Europe have heard for the last forty years or more.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Neuberg wrote: &#x0201C;I found Germany in a wonderful state of transformation: like on the day after a successful revolution. &#x02026; <supplied>[E]</supplied>very town, and most railway stations I passed, were occupied by armed Prussians; with here and there parties of <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>armed Austrian prisoners &#x02026; a medley of Czechs, Slovaks, Croats, Hungarians &#x02003;c. who often did not understand each other; and physically as well as intellectually greatly inferior to their conquerors.&#x0201D;</note>
 May the Heavens prosper it! Many thanks also for Bismarck&#x02019;s photograph: he has a royal enough physiognomy, and I more and more believe him to be a highly considerable man;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Neuberg wrote: &#x0201C;Bismarck is the hero of the day; his portraits are on all the shop windows.

For my own share, all the light that has yet reached me on Mr. Eyre and his history in the world goes steadily to establish the conclusion that he is a just, humane, and valiant man, faithful to his trusts everywhere, and with no ordinary faculty of executing them; that his late services in Jamaica were of great, perhaps of incalculable value, as certainly they were of perilous and appalling difficulty&#x02014;something like the case of &#x02018;fire,&#x02019; suddenly reported, &#x02018;in the ship&#x02019;s powder room,&#x02019; in mid-ocean, where the moments mean the ages, and life and death hang on your use or misuse of the moments; and, in short, that penalty and clamour are not the thing this Governor merits from any of us, but honour and thanks, and wise imitation (I will farther say), should similar emergencies rise, on the great scale or on the small, in whatever we are governing!</p>

<p>The English nation never loved anarchy, nor was wont to spend its sympathy on miserable mad seditions, especially of this inhuman and half-brutish type; but always loved order, and the prompt suppression of seditions, and reserved its tears for something worthier than promoters of such delirious and fatal enterprises who had got their wages for their sad industry. Has the English nation changed, then, altogether? I flatter myself it has not, not yet quite; but only that certain loose, superficial portions of it have become a great deal louder, and not any wiser than they formerly used to be.</p>
<p>At any rate, though much averse at any time, and at this time in particular, to figure on committees, or run into public noises without call, I do at once, and feel that as a British citizen I should and must make you welcome to my name for your committee,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">The news of Eyre&#x02019;s dismissal and the threat of his prosecution prompted widespread support for his cause, and the Eyre Testimonial and Defence Fund was formed.</note> and to whatever good it can do you. With the hope only that many other British men, of far more significance in such a matter, will at once or gradually do the like; and that, in fine, by wise effort and persistence, a blind and disgraceful act of public injustice may be prevented, and <pb id="pg-44-46" n="44:46"/>an egregious folly as well&#x02014;not to say, for none can say or compute, what a vital detriment throughout the British Empire, in such an example set to all the colonies and governors the British Empire has.</p>
<p>Farther service, I fear, I am not in a state to promise; but the whole weight of my conviction and good wishes is with you, and if other service possible to me do present itself, I shall not want for willingness in case of need.

<salute>Dear Sir:&#x02014;</salute>
<p>If you will be so kind as come down to me tomorrow (Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi>), at 8 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi>, we will have a cup of tea together.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Smalley wrote, <date when="1881-02-8">8 Feb. 1881</date>: &#x0201C;To Mr. Emerson, to whom I owe many other things, I owe my introduction to Mr. Carlyle. On my first visit to London, fourteen years ago, I left Mr. Emerson&#x02019;s letter at the door of the house in Cheyne Row, and the same evening brought me this note&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi>, <date when="1866-02-23">23 Feb.</date>).

<salute>Yours sincerely /</salute>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Smalley described his visit: &#x0201C;The street was, and still is, a very modest street. There is a chandler&#x02019;s shop on the corner, and a laundry next door but one to Mr. Carlyle&#x02019;s. So humble are the surroundings and the house itself that years afterward, when I took a &#x02026; friend to call on Mr. Carlyle he looked about him in wonder as we stopped at the door, and asked half incredulously, &#x02018;Does so great a man live in so little a house?&#x02019; A maid-servant answered the bell, and I was shown into a room on the left of the narrow passage on the ground-floor. The room was dimly lighted. A lady came forward, whom I afterward knew as Mr. Carlyle&#x02019;s niece, Miss Aitken, and said in a whisper that her uncle was asleep but that he expected me and I was to wait. On the left of the door, against the wall, was a sofa, and on the sofa was Mr. Carlyle. He soon woke and I introduced myself, Miss Aitken having vanished. Now I had heard before coming to England an awkward story or two of the great writer&#x02019;s odd way of receiving strangers. Americans, it was said, were less welcome than others; and though I knew very well that Mr. Emerson&#x02019;s introduction was the best I could have, I was not over-confident of a cordial greeting.&#x0201D; The &#x0201C;lady&#x0201D; was not Mary Aitken but is unidentified: perhaps Smalley had confused his first visit, <date when="1866-08">Aug. 1866</date>, with the later one as Mary Aitken did not come to live with TC until after his visit to Dumfries, summer <date when="1868">1868</date>. Emerson apparently told Smalley: &#x0201C;You must not be surprised if you find him inhospitable to American ideas, and perhaps to Americans&#x0201D; (Slater 49).&#x0201C;But I found that in this, as in some other points, the Carlyle of common report and the actual Carlyle were two different persons. His hearty way of saying, &#x02018;Eh! and so you are a friend of Mr. Emerson,&#x02019; and his outstretched hand, were quite enough to put a shy man at his ease. Not even in America had I ever seen anybody to whom ordinary social usages were more obviously indifferent. It was the hour when London dines, and in order to dine arrays itself in swallow-tail and white tie. Mr. Carlyle had dined early, and the tall figure that rose from the sofa was clad in a dressing-gown of a red pattern reaching below his knees. He questioned me eagerly about Mr. Emerson. &#x02026; His manner as he spoke of his American friend was gentle and affectionate. &#x02026; <supplied>[H]</supplied>e said he usually took a walk at this hour, and would I go with him? I remembered the pouring rain and wondered if he would go out in it, but the weather was a thing to which, as I found later, he gave no thought. By the time he had put on a coat and hat and seized his big stick, it rained no longer. It was quite dark, and it had long been his habit to walk after the sun had gone down. He did not seem to care for the river and the fresh currents of air which blew freely from its banks. His steps were bent toward the quieter corners of quiet old Chelsea. &#x02026; His pace was such as few men of past seventy would have cared to set; and he maintained it to the end. The stream of talk ran not less swiftly. &#x02026; It was past nine when we returned. The candles had been lighted. The fire&#x02014;for though it was August a fire had been kindled&#x02014;blazed cheerfully. The table was spread: the tea was made and keeping hot under its Scotch cosey. &#x02026; There was no detail of a life strange to him which had not some interest for him. He put all sorts of questions as he sat behind his teapot and took huge sips from his cup and munched his bread and butter and plum-cake. &#x02026; Tea and questions over &#x02026; <supplied>[h]</supplied>e sat himself down by the fireside, on the floor, his back against the jamb of the chimneypiece, took a comb out of his pocket and combed down his tangled bushy hair till it hid is forehead altogether, and you could no longer see where the hair ended and the eyebrows began. This done, he filled and lighted his pipe; a long clay pipe &#x02026; known, I think, as a churchwarden; quite two feet from bowl to mouthpiece. As the perfume of the tobacco filled the room and the clouds of smoke rolled about him, he began to talk again. It was no longer talk in the common sense of the word; there were no more questions, no pauses. It was a monologue, and no small part of it sounded strangely familiar. &#x02026; He had, in fact, by that time fallen into the habit of repeating orally what in days long gone he had written,&#x02014;not consciously or purposely, but as if the same trains of thought came back to him; and he was content to have a listener while he thought over the old problems that had vexed him, and once more offered his solution of them. &#x02026; I never had a stranger sensation than in thus hearing from the mouth of the philosopher the oral repetition of his written and printed wisdom. &#x02026; When it seemed to have to come to an end I rose to take leave, and upon my telling him I was going to Berlin he asked me to come again on my return and bring him all the news of the Prussian capital&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi>, <date when="1866-02-23">23 Feb.</date>; G.

There had been, after 3 days of extreme heat, an extensive Thunderstorm (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I did not hear) ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 4 a.m., and copious rain wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> at least laid all the <hi rend="italic">dust</hi>; and the Country, harvest just ending in it, was fresh and beautiful throughout, till the last 7 or 8 miles of it, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> might have challenged the created and almost the chaotic universe to produce its fellow in disgusting the sane mind <hi rend="italic">not</hi> concerned in the &#x0201C;unexampled prosperity&#x0201D; now afoot. The Painters, busy <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> during my absence, had all got away, their work seemingly well enough done, and their smells also gone. Mrs Warren was here assiduous, in the gaunt solitude; and was, and is, extremely attentive; but the loss of Jessie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">See <ref target="volume-44/lt-18660810-TC-JCA-01">

The Town is clean airy, utterly vacant of acquaintance; and no company at all is a treasure compared with much that is offered one. Among a heap of vile <hi rend="italic">post</hi> rubbish, I was glad enough to find y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter &#x02003; Jean&#x02019;s.

In the meantime I can see clearly that a winter in so clear &#x02003; bright a climate might be the means of doing you great good, if it could be tried on rational &#x02003; steady terms. In particular it might put you into such health as to enable you, when you get back, to avoid the late walks, &#x02003; late hours generally, into which you have been driven by circumstances &#x02003; which are very unnatural for a man in weak health.&#x0201D; Caroline Davenport Bromley wrote to Lady Ashburton, <date when="1866-08-29">29 Aug.</date>: &#x0201C;I wonder if Carlyle will ever make up his mind to go to you. He had a letter f<hi rend="italic">m</hi> his brother D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle strongly urging him to go but he seemed very uncertain&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note>
 and I agree with them in nearly <pb id="pg-44-49" n="44:49"/>every point.

 &#x02026; In short, contrary to all hope, I had to set my own shoulders to the wheel, and if it made any progress at all, which I hope it did, especially in that of trying for an infinitely <hi rend="italic">better</hi> committee,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">According to the report of the first meeting, TC, &#x0201C;on taking the chair,&#x0201D; explained that he &#x0201C;considered that the committee should be presided over by some nobleman of power and influence. As he &#x02026; however, considered it to be a solemn public duty on the part of every man who believed that Governor Eyre had quelled the insurrection in Jamaica, and saved that island, to come forward and boldly proclaim such to be his opinion, he would gladly consent to take the chair at the present meeting.&#x0201D; Several people expressed by letter &#x0201C;disapprobation at the word &#x02018;Testimonial&#x02019; being used,&#x0201D; being of the opinion that &#x0201C;a Fund being raised for the defence of Mr. Eyre was in itself a Testimonial.&#x0201D; TC &#x0201C;considered that it would be advisable to meet the wishes of all well affected parties, and he therefore proposed that the title of the fund be altered from &#x02018;The Eyre Testimonial and Defence Fund&#x02019; to &#x02018;The Eyre Defence and Aid Fund.&#x02019; In his opinion the amount of money subscribed, though an important, was by no means the most important point. The main object of the committee ought to be to attack resolutely, by all fair methods, the fallacy (for such he could not but believe it to be) that these noisy denunciations of Mr. Eyre were the deliberate voice of the people of England, or did at all express England&#x02019;s opinion about Mr. Eyre. / It was ultimately agreed that the fund should henceforth be entitled &#x02018;The Eyre Defence and Aid Fund&#x02019;&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Eyre Defence and Aid Fund</hi> 21).</note>
 the probable chief cause was that my old coat is not afraid of a little mud on the sleeve of it, as superfiner ones might be. Poor Eyre! I am heartily sorry for him, and for the English nation, which makes such a dismal fool of itself.

<salute>Dear Kingsley,</salute>
<p>From the first time I got acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Gov<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Eyre&#x02019;s proceedings in the Jamaica outbreak, my clear feeling was, That his conduct had been that of a faithful, valiant, wise and manful Representative of the English Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,&#x02014;in an affair wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, had he <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been such, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have excelled in horror and sanguinary misery most things one can well conceive as happening <hi rend="italic">above</hi> ground in this Earth;&#x02014;and in fact, from all I had learned of Eyre then or before, my notion w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been, had <hi rend="italic">my</hi> post been that of English King, to appoint Eyre <hi rend="italic">Dictator</hi> over Jamaica for the next 25 years, as pretty much the one chance there was for saving the West Indies or it. And nothing I have happened to hear since has in the least altered my opin<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, or thrown any new light what<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">Jamaica</hi> matter to me,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; it has on the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> a little, and of a very baleful and ominous complex<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, so far as <hi rend="italic">it</hi> goes! In truth, few things in my time have more disgusted me than this recept<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, by my Writing Countrymen, of a Hero who had, with such promptitude, sagacity &#x02003; intrepidity, trampled out <hi rend="italic">fire in the powder-room</hi>, and saved the whole W. Indies <hi rend="italic">ship</hi> from flying aloft amid the deep seas,&#x02014;not with human thanks and recognit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> deep and universal, but with blatant clamours, rising to the height of execrat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> as I here &#x02003; there find. The blame, first of all, I take it, was that of the Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi>; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have permitted no questioning &#x02003; answering by the many-headed; but have declared with brevity that it was satisfied with its servant,&#x02014;&#x0201C;Bring <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a fault home upon him, in the proved form; then will we speak, not till then!&#x0201D; Hence these lamentat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, shriekeries, and insanities; at once frightful, doleful, and abominable, as if Phlegethon and Houndsditch<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Phlegethon was a river of hell-fire in Greek mythology, and Houndsditch was an area of East London inhabited by Jewish secondhand clothes dealers.</note>
 had run into one, and both good sense and common honesty had forsaken poor Engl<hi rend="italic">d</hi> for the time! However, I do believe these to be <hi rend="italic">blatancies</hi>, mass bleatings by innumerable <hi rend="italic">sheep</hi> (rabid as wolves in some cases), but with the sense merely of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> sheep&#x02019;s head in them,&#x02014;if you have noticed the ways of sheep, one head correctly <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> in insight to 1,000 or to 1,000,000,&#x02014;and perhaps even that <hi rend="italic">one</hi> applying itself only half or tenth-part to <hi rend="italic">form</hi> a real judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi>: alas, alas!&#x02014;</p>
<p>All y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> misgivings ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Engl<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and her interests of every kind, have long long been my own in still dismaller forms;&#x02014;and if these <hi rend="italic">blatancies</hi> are not to be put down by a <hi rend="italic">voice</hi> of the Nat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> emphatic enough for the purpose, I shall regard even them as of very ill omen at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, is not the practical English of all this: &#x0201C;I will join the Eyre <pb id="pg-44-52" n="44:52"/>Com<hi rend="italic">ee</hi>; &#x02003; personally <hi rend="italic">appear</hi> among them, Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> next,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">The next meeting was Wed., <date when="1866-09-05">5 Sept.</date>

Froude has been written to, &#x02003; is much wanted;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Hamilton Hume wrote, <date when="1866-09-03">3 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Froude has written to say that in consequence of his relations with the proprietor of Frasers Magazine he cannot join our Committee.&#x0201D; Froude himself wrote later: &#x0201C;I was myself one of the cowards. I pleaded that I did not understand the matter, that I was editor of &#x02018;Fraser,&#x02019; and should disturb the proprietors; mere paltry excuses to escape doing what I knew to be right&#x0201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:329).</note>
 but personally I feel bound to be silent to you both: men in official or quasi-offic<hi rend="italic">l</hi> posit<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> cannot be careless of the enfuriated <hi rend="italic">sheep</hi> of the world as I can.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Kingsley was currently chaplain to Queen Victoria, as well as professor of modern history at Cambridge University.

I have been cursed for it, as if I had been a dog, who had never stood up for the working man &#x02026; and imperilled my own prospects in life in behalf of freedom and justice. Now, men insult me because I stand up for a man whom I believe ill-used, calumniated, and hunted to death by fanatics. &#x02026; [A] brave and good man, doing his best under terrible difficulties&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Charles Kingsley: His Letters and Memories of His Life</hi>, ed.

Thought of writing several times, on receiving perhaps a new volume of Friedrich, to criticize you perhaps&#x02014;or on hearing how Edinburgh University had done itself the honour to make you Lord-Rector, to congratulate you. Now at last I write, not to criticize or congratulate, but to say one friendly word to you in your loneliness&#x02014;for I have just heard that your good kind Wife is dead&#x02014; Whom I well remember to have met in that room at Chelsea, on an evening twenty years ago. Certain days &#x02003; hours of my life, very far behind me now, are vividly present to me always, when I wish to call them up&#x02014; And that evening is one of them&#x02014; Words of consolation I have none, but you will take this bit of a letter as at least a token of human sympathy, from one who also hath had losses. / And I hear you are still at Chelsea&#x02014;still, I suppose in that very room, with those very books, &#x02003; others&#x02014;for books gather. They also get scattered&#x02014; I have had in my life four quite considerable collections of books, all scattered from time to time, by various &#x02003; sudden changes, &#x02003; now existing somewhere in infinite space, over the breadth of two hemispheres, or of four, if it takes four hemispheres to make a globe: a point which few have had more ample means of determining than I have had.&#x0201D; Mitchel had supported the Confederacy in the U.S. Civil War: &#x0201C;I fear you will never forgive us poor Confederates, for being beaten. We did all we could&#x02014; But the Yankee calculation&#x02014;giving five of their men for one of ours, brought us to an end at last. For they had all the universe behind them as a recruiting depot, &#x02003; could replace their five&#x02014;we had nothing behind us but the guarded sea, &#x02003; could not replace our one. It was in vain that our good Confederates cut so deep, and so often, into that Yankee army, so big though so flabby&#x02014;they could not, on that calculation, get to the end of it. It was a wild &#x02003; sad struggle. My eldest son, an artillery officer, &#x02003; Commandant of Fort Sumter, was torn to pieces by a shell on the ramparts, dying at his post. He, poor fellow, always remembered you, whom when a little boy, he saw in Dublin. My third son fell on the fields of Gettysburg: &#x02003; the second still lives, but with four wounds. He served in the Virginia army from the first day of the war to the last. / I was here in France when the war broke out&#x02014; Could not for a long while get to the Confederate States, owing to the blockade, for I had my family (the female part of it) with me, &#x02003; could not venture to run them through the blockade. At last I went over by myself in the third year of the war&#x02014;was followed the next year by my wife &#x02003; daughter, who undertook to penetrate the blockade in one of the small swift steamers built for that purpose. Their ship was chased, they were driven ashore on a desert beach at midnight&#x02014;&#x02003; the ship with everything it contained (including their all) burnt before their eyes&#x02014; Well this is a small part of our story, but the rest is to match.

<p>The Eyre Committee is going on better, indeed is now getting fairly on its feet.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">The second meeting of the Eyre Defence Committee took place, <date when="1866-09-05">5 Sept.</date>, with TC again in the chair; TC began with: &#x0201C;he was glad to find that no less than twenty-five new names had been added&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;that subscriptions were flowing in from all quarters&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Eyre Defence and Aid Fund</hi> 21).</note>
 Ruskin&#x02019;s speech&#x02014;now don&#x02019;t frown upon it, but read it again till you understand it&#x02014;is a right gallant thrust I can assure you. While all the world stands tremulous, shilly-shallying from the gutter, impetuous Ruskin plunges his rapier up to the very hilt in the abominable belly of the vast blockheadism, and leaves it staring very considerably.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Ruskin spoke at length about his motives for supporting the governor&#x02019;s cause: &#x0201C;He had joined the committee &#x02026; in the simple desire of obtaining justice, not for black men only, nor for white, but for men of every race and colour. He detested all cruelty, and all injustice by whomsoever inflicted, or suffered; he would sternly reprobate the crime which dragged a black family from their home, to dig your fields; and more sternly the crime which turned a white family out of their home, that you might drive by a shorter road over their hearth. But, whatever might be the motive or the temper of the accusations brought against Mr. Eyre, the ground of them was, under any circumstances, untenable. His accusers were under the radical mistake of confusing the office of a governor with that of a judge. &#x02026; The question put at issue by the adverse prosecution was in fact this &#x02026; whether Mr. Eyre, under circumstances of instant public danger, did, or did not, do to the best of his power and ability, what he believed to be his duty? &#x02026; Had he, after all efforts bravely made, failed of his purpose&#x02014;had he lost Jamaica, instead of saving it&#x02014;if then &#x02026; he might justly and advisedly have been superseded; but not even then brought to trial, on such grounds. But as the matter stands, the official removal of him from his place was an act of national imbecility. &#x02026; It was the act&#x02014;as this threat of prosecution was the cry&#x02014;of a nation blinded by its avarice to all true valour and virtue &#x02026; it was the suicidal act of a people which, for the sake of filling its pockets, would pour mortal venom into all its airs and all its streams; would shorten the lives of its labourers by thirty years a life, that it might get its needle-packets twopence each cheaper; would communicate its liberty to foreign nations by forcing them to buy poison at the cannon&#x02019;s mouth, and prove its chivalry to them by shrinking in panic from the side of a people being slaughtered, though a people who had given them their daughter for their future queen;&#x02014;and then would howl in the frantic collapse of their decayed consciences, that they might be permitted righteously to reward with ruin the man who had dared to strike down one seditious leader, and rescue the lives of a population&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Eyre Defence and Aid Fund</hi> 21&#x02013;22).</note>

<p>I am very sensible to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and Mrs Kingsley&#x02019;s kindness; but, alas, I must not leave my gloomy solitude for any sunnier place at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Frances Kingsley; presumably Kingsley had invited TC to visit their home at Eversley Rectory, Hampshire, about 40 mi. (64 km.) from Chelsea.</note>
 I am trying to get into something like employ<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of my days again, with very poor success hitherto, but with constantly renewed efforts,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Ruskin wrote suggesting an idea for a final work by TC, <date when="1866-10-01">1 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;It seems to me that a magnificent <hi rend="italic">closing</hi> work for you to do would be to set your finger on the turning points and barriers in European history&#x02014;to gather them into train of light&#x02014;to give, without troubling yourself about detail or proof, your own <hi rend="italic">final</hi> impression of the crises and causes of things&#x02014;and your thoughts of the leading men, <hi rend="italic">who</hi> they were and <hi rend="italic">what</hi> they were. If you like to do this&#x02014;I&#x02019;ll come and <hi rend="italic">write</hi> for you a piece of every day, if after beginning it, you still found the mere handwork troublesome. I have a notion it would be very wholesome work for me, &#x02003; it would be very proud &#x02003; dear for me. But that&#x02019;s by the way.&#x02014; Only think of the thing itself.&#x0201D;</note>
 at lowest, I am inuring myself to the New condit<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> under wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the poor remnants of life must be spent or wasted henceforth. Any smallest alterat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of my silent daily habits produces an anarchy to me wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not believe unless you saw it!&#x02014; &#x02014;</p>
<p>That you want to talk with me, is good news. Come &#x02003; see me, I pray you, when you are in Town ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and you shall have plenty of that.</p>

<salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>
<p>I have ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> read all these Letters; but do not, from Mr Price<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Ruskin had forwarded to TC letters sent him by George Price (<date when="1812">1812</date>&#x02013;<date when="1890">90</date>) (Bernard Semmel, <hi rend="italic">The Governor Eyre Controversy</hi> [<date when="1962">1962</date>] 112). Price managed his family&#x02019;s Jamaican sugar plantation, Worthy Park, <date when="1844">1844</date>&#x02013;<date when="1863">63</date>, and established a reputation as a good employer who respected his Negro workers, paid them fair wages, eliminated irregular patterns of employment, and gave them better security. In <date when="1854">1854</date> he was elected to the Legislative Assembly, and became Custos (chief magistrate) of the precinct of St. Catherine; he resigned, <date when="1864">1864</date>, in protest against Governor Eyre; returning to England, <date when="1865">1865</date>, he continued to campaign against Eyre, and pbd. <hi rend="italic">Jamaica and the Colonial Office: Who Caused the Crisis?</hi> (<date when="1866-07">July 1866</date>), a scathing analysis of Eyre&#x02019;s misgovernment. The book contained copies of various letters from Price and others concerning the Jamaican crisis, and Price apparently included some of these in his letter to Ruskin; see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18661011-TC-JRU-01"><corr>TC to JRU, <date when="1866-10-11">11 Oct.</date></corr></ref></note> or his <hi rend="italic">Jamaica Standard</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Probably the <hi rend="italic">Colonial Standard and Jamaica Despatch</hi>.</note> get the least glimmer of new light ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x0201C;the Tramway swindle&#x0201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">The tramway scandal, <date when="1862">1862</date>&#x02013;<date when="1865">65</date>, concerned a scheme for the construction of a tramway, projected before Eyre&#x02019;s term of office but sanctioned by Eyre, which Prince opposed on the grounds that the scheme was fraudulent and Edmund Leahy (ca. <date when="1813">1813</date>&#x02013;<date when="1888">88</date>), Colonial engineer and architect <date when="1858">1858</date>&#x02013;<date when="1863">63</date>, dishonest. In a public inquiry into Eyre&#x02019;s mishandling of the case, Eyre was accused of flouting local laws and procedures, and of failing to investigate Leahy&#x02019;s fraudulent estimates. Price led a movement in the Assembly to suspend any further money bills until Eyre&#x02019;s executive committee resigned; Eyre responded by dissolving the Assembly and informing the Colonial Office in London that he had done so because of the Assembly&#x02019;s refusal to pass the money bill, though making no reference to the tramway scandal. Price persisted in his criticism, and under extreme pressure Eyre examined Leahy&#x02019;s figures, agreed that fraud had been intended, and eventually but still extremely reluctantly agreed to prosecute Leahy, who was found guilty and dismissed. Price believed that the tramway scandal was a major cause of the Morant Bay disturbance in <date when="1865">1865</date>.</note> or any of the other miracles alledged,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I can only conceive as more or less <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> misbirths of that nearly <hi rend="italic">in</hi>conceivable little <hi rend="italic">chaos in a coalbox</hi> (probably very violent, and sure to be <hi rend="italic">fuliginous</hi>) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> they call &#x0201C;House of Assembly&#x0201D;; all intent upon <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> of various kinds, while their Governor was pushing towards work and result. A mere heap of flaming soot; abstrusely equal to zero for us! Mr Price, I have no reason to doubt, was and is perfectly honest and <hi rend="italic">bonâ-fide</hi>; but need not concern us farther.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Ruskin replied, <date when="1866-09-29">29 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;The reason I attached overdue weight to Price&#x02019;s letter you might partly guess from his niece&#x02019;s, which I left with you, not inadvertently.&#x0201D; George Price&#x02019;s niece was Maria La Touche, b. Price (d. <date when="1906">1906</date>), da. of George Price&#x02019;s eldest brother; Ruskin had been friendly with Maria, and particularly with her da. Rose (<date when="1848">1848</date>&#x02013;<date when="1875">75</date>), for several years.</note></p>
<p>The best thing you can now do is to consult seriously that practical Mr Harris;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">Ruskin wrote: &#x0201C;I asked [Hamilton Hume] &#x02026; whether he might not be helped in his present work by the lawyer&#x02019;s precision of my friend Mr. Pattison&#x02014;(I heedlessly called him Harrison to you the other night&#x02014;having another lawyer and politico-economist friend of that name).&#x0201D; Pattison and Harrison are unidentified; Mark Pattison (<date when="1813">1813</date>&#x02013;<date when="1884">84</date>; <ref target="volume-44/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21585"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), rector of Lincoln College, Oxford, later a friend of Ruskin&#x02019;s, was not a lawyer, and Frederic Harrison (<date when="1831">1831</date>&#x02013;<date when="1923">1923</date>; <ref target="volume-44/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33732"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), although a lawyer, was anti-politicial economy and anti-Eyre.</note> <pb id="pg-44-63" n="44:63"/>and if, unfortunately, he won&#x02019;t be of the Committee, get him to undertake that Lucid Digest, or conclusive little Summary of facts and of principles, w<hi rend="italic">hh must</hi> be set forth, and addressed to the British People for their answer.

In the darkest part of the Hoddam road young James Austin &#x02003; he were letting their horse walk cautiously, when a drunk man [Roddick of Trailtrow] &#x02026; came driving furiously in the opposite direction &#x02003; upset their conveyance, &#x02003; his own of which he broke one wheel &#x02003; both the shafts. Of course Jamie &#x02003; young James were thrown down violently &#x02003; both hurt. &#x02026; So far as I can judge Jamie is out of all danger, suffering only from the pains in his shoulders. &#x02026; We did not hear at all of his accident till the 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x02014;six days after it had happened&#x02014;&#x02003; it seemed unnecessary to grieve you with the news of it till we had heard how Jamie had got out of it.&#x0201D; Jean wrote, <date when="1866-09-30">30 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;John [Jamie&#x02019;s son] wrote to the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Thursday that his Father was &#x02018;getting better &#x02003; had been able to go out a little this day week Sunday.

The D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> laments as if James had thrown himself away in taking Catherine. She <hi rend="italic">is</hi> quite uncultivated poor lassie except the experience that hard work has given her; but I think in reality she is the best of the two. She is well stocked in some of the qualities that is wanting is Jas. She is a patient, considerate lass Catherine with plenty of common sense.

<salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>
<p>I chanced to be a little out of sorts last night,&#x02014;the cause inconceivably small, that of first drinking two mouthfuls of bad tea in a house where I called, and then of eating cauliflower instead of potatoe at dinner here; <hi rend="italic">inconceivably</hi> small, but suffic<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to keep me prettily awake the greater part of last night!

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Note came yesterday morning; a few hours after my last had set out for you. I proceeded, in the afternoon walk, to discover &#x0201C;Carlisle Terrace, Kensington,&#x0201D; the Reichenbach place of abode; found, contrary to expectat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, the Count just <hi rend="italic">returned</hi> from Germany; and so could at least reckon on a prompt answer.

My loss was sudden, as if by lightning: but <hi rend="italic">her</hi> death was very beautiful, and such as she had always wished; her noble life, at that point of time (what with those poor Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> celebrations, and her love to me the object of them), w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be felt by her, I know well, to be crowned by perfect <hi rend="italic">victory</hi>; and indeed everybody testifies, what was most of all evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to myself, that her last eighteen months, and especially her last two weeks and her last <hi rend="italic">day</hi>, were the happiest she had had for many years.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">For JWC&#x02019;s last months, <date when="1865-10">Oct. 1865</date> to <date when="1866-04">April 1866</date>, see vol. 43.</note>
 Beautiful she was in her utter feebleness and gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> misery of health; &#x02003; had such an unconquerable radiancy of cheerfulness, and tranquil clearness, and warmth of affection and generosity to those about her, as are now forever memorable to those that looked on them. To me her loss has been the loss of all that made life valuable; and I do not seem to gather much insensibility to it; but at all hours of the day, and every turn of my procedures in the world, am painfully reminded that <hi rend="italic">she</hi>, my<pb id="pg-44-73" n="44:73"/>bright fellow-pilgrim, has gone from me beyond the stars, and that the rest of my journey must be done wearily <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>. It is the will of God, it is the everlasting Order of Nature; and I must not repine,&#x02014;nor do I; but strive always to readjust my astonished thoughts, and try more and more to set myself and &#x0201C;my house in order,&#x0201D; and to find still something not quite useless wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I may <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for the days that remain, till I follow not unworthily those that have honourably gone. Enough on this subject, dear Brother of my young years now far away; more than enough,&#x02014;for you know already, in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own sympathetic heart, all that I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say upon it.</p>
<p>My bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> at present is with two small things I had to send you as memorial: the first is a Photograph done the year before her death, and incomparably the best there ever was of her;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">

</note>
 it will recal many remembrances, and be a softly <hi rend="italic">pious</hi> kind of company to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> now and then. The other is the bit of <hi rend="italic">green Paper</hi> here inclosed, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have been intending for some time and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is now come to hand in the ready state.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC sent &#x000A3;100 to John A. Carlyle to be changed into a money order to send to Canada: &#x0201C;<date when="1866-10-17">17 Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1866</date> / to Br<hi rend="italic">r</hi> John (for <hi rend="italic">Alick</hi> in Canada) / &#x000A3;100 .. 0 .. 0&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753); John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1866-10-18">18 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;I &#x02026; enclose the &#x000A3;100 order for Alick which I have got from the Bank of Scotland. &#x02026; The Bank Order costs nothing. Today is the Canada post, but there is also one on Saturday.&#x0201D;</note>
 The small Gift is to me, in no conceivable sense, any loss at all; and you it may be of some use,&#x02014;to help some of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> children, to do this or that: no doubt there are &#x0201C;holes that need stopping up,&#x0201D; and you will find uses for it. Consider it as <hi rend="italic">her</hi> Gift; she is in part the cause of it,&#x02014;the guiding cause at this time. I told you once, I was grown <hi rend="italic">rich</hi>; that is not <hi rend="italic">so</hi> true as I then tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it (for my revenues, coming out <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> sales &#x02003; their fluctuations, soon fell off ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; but it is still true <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>; and of money there is indisputably abundance and super-abundance far beyond what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> shall ever (to all all<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Word repeated with a line over it at turn of page.</note>
 appearance) have the least chance to need;&#x02014;so that, if at any time you are in a strait, I charge you strictly to let me know; it will be a real charity to me. Alas, it is, at all times, so <hi rend="italic">little</hi> we can do for one another:&#x02014;and the time is fast striding on, when it will be nothing, forever!&#x02014; My blessing be with you, dear Brother, &#x02003; with all that are yours, far over the sea yonder.</p>
<p>I am myself in average bodily health; not <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> that way, since April last; perhaps even some slight shade better, so quiet and mostly <hi rend="italic">passive</hi> have I been: but indeed the 12 years deadly wrestle with my last Book had quite broken me of itself, not to speak of the 58 <hi rend="italic">foregoing</hi> years,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC was 70.</note>
 and New calamities that have followed! I am living quite alone for the last two months and more; and tho&#x02019; it is occasionally not a little dreary, and at all times sad and sombre more or less, I find it more supportable than most kinds of company I might<pb id="pg-44-74" n="44:74"/>have. The Dr, as you know, was with me most of the summer; so was &#x0201C;Maggie Welsh&#x0201D; (one of the Liverpool Cousins, used to the house here): John talked of being back perhaps in Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; Maggie too will consent to come if I ask it;&#x02014;and it is not yet cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> how I shall finally arrange. There was left me here an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> elderly servant,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss">Sarah Warren.</note>
 of highly respectable, skilful &#x02003; rational ways; with her, and a small <hi rend="italic">gleg</hi> little girl<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss">Alice Clark, employed <date when="1866-09-23">23 Sept.</date>

 under her, the house goes on quite reasonably well hitherto, and I have no disturbance on that side.</p>
<p>From John I heard the other day;&#x02014;indeed it was he that got ready for me that <hi rend="italic">green Paper</hi> inclosed:&#x02014;our Dumfriesshire friends are all in their usual health; and nothing very bad happening to any of them.

In the first half of <date when="1866">1866</date>, several Fenian raids were made on British installations in Canada. Because of supply shortages and a lack of coordination and manpower, the Fenians were soon defeated and many were arrested and imprisoned; many Fenians wrote letters of protest to Andrew Johnson (<date when="1808">1808</date>&#x02013;<date when="1875">75</date>), president of the U.S., <date when="1865">1865</date>&#x02013;<date when="1869">69</date>, complaining of a lack of assistance from the U.S. consul, and requesting his assistance to obtain their release. In Oct. a group of Fenians assembled in Vermont, apparently with the intention of again raiding into Canada, but were deterred by U.S. troops.</note>
 I believe nothing whatever of <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> will come of it more; and that, when once the Yankee <hi rend="italic">Elections</hi> are over (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will be next month), it will die out altogether; no Yankee Politic<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, never so blackguard, having the temptat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to pretend flattering it farther.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss">Facing mid-term Congressional elections, the Democratic President Johnson, although anxious not to alienate the large Irish-American population that usually voted Democrat, was also concerned not to violate existing neutrality laws with Canada.

<p>You pretty, but unreasonable, child! I never translated &#x0201C;Goethe&#x02019;s Works,&#x0201D; nor any part of them but the &#x0201C;Wilhelm Meister,&#x0201D; and some short fractions scattered up and down among my own writings. The &#x0201C;Wilhelm Meister,&#x0201D; (both parts) I would willingly send you, but the Publisher here informs me that the conveyance, &#x02003;c., to New-York will outweigh any advantage to you, and that the direct and easiest plan is that you apply to &#x0201C;Johnston &#x02003; Co.&#x0201D; (address inclosed) who are close at hand,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC&#x02019;s publisher was Chapman &#x02003; Hall; Johnston &#x02003; Co. was presumably a New York bookseller.</note>
 in case you actually want a &#x0201C;Wilhelm Meister&#x0201D; which is itself uncertain to me.</p>
<p>Don&#x02019;t calculate on seeing me when you next come to London. I am grown very old; have no desire&#x02014;but the contrary&#x02014;for being &#x0201C;seen&#x0201D;&#x02014;and find my little remnant of time all occupied with infinitely more important things. Read me, read Goethe, and if you will be a good girl, and feel a call to do so, read all the good books you can come at; and carefully <hi rend="italic">avoid</hi> (like poison) all the Bad, so far as you can discriminate them, which will be more and more, the more faithfully you try. Happy is he (still more is <hi rend="italic">she</hi>) who has got to know a Bad Book by the very flavor; and to fly from it, (and from the base, vain and unprofitable soul that wrote it) as from a thing requiring to be left <hi rend="italic">at once</hi> to leeward! And let me tell you further, pretty little Juliette, reading, even of the best, is but one of the sources of wisdom, and by no manner of means, the most important. The most important, all-including is, that you <hi rend="italic">love</hi> wisdom loyally in your heart of hearts; and that wherever you learn from a Book, or elsewhere, a thing credibly <hi rend="italic">wise</hi>, you <hi rend="italic">don&#x02019;t</hi> lose time in calling or thinking it &#x0201C;wise,&#x0201D; but proceed at once to see how, with your best discernment, energy, and caution, you can manage to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it! That is the rule of rules; that latter.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-44-76" n="44:76"/>May your years be many, and bright with modest nobleness; &#x0201C;happy&#x0201D; enough they will be, in such case&#x02014;and so adieu, my pretty child.</p>

I have had many thoughts since I last saw you,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">This was presumably at the end of TC&#x02019;s stay with Thomas Erskine, 11 Gt. Stuart St., Edinburgh, during the rectorial visit, <date when="1866-03-31">31 March</date> to <date when="1866-04-07">7 April</date>; see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660401-TC-JWC-01"><sic>43:153&#x02013;54</sic><corr>TC to JWC, (<date when="1866-04-01">1 April</date>)</corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660403-TC-JWC-01"><sic>158&#x02013;59</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1866-04-03">3 April</date></corr></ref>.

A calamity which was most sudden, which was infinite to me, and for which there is no remedy conceivable, my poor little home in this world, as if struck by lightning, when I least expected it, and shattered all into ruin!&#x02014; I have had enough to think of, to mourn over, and earnestly consider; taking counsel of the Eternities mainly, and of such still voices as dwell <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. I have been and am very sad, sad as death I may well say; but not miserable either; nothing of the mean wretchedness which has defaced other long portions of my life. This is all noble, tender, solemn to me. I might define it as a time of divine <hi rend="italic">worship</hi> rather, perhaps the only period of real <hi rend="italic">worship</hi> I have known for a great while past. I have tried considerably to be busy, too, and am still trying. Much has to be set in order, and rest is not permitted till I follow whither she has gone before me. May my death, which stands calmly consolatory in my sight at all moments, be beautiful as hers, and God&#x02019;s will be done now and for ever.</p>
<p>For several weeks there was absolutely no speech or company. Now there is occasionally an hour of rational discourse, which is worth something. Vain, idle talk, which is always rife enough, I find much sadder than any form of silence. My bodily health is not worse, perhaps ever a shade better than what you last saw of it. My arrangements for the winter are not yet fixed; but I try to keep myself in what I fondly call work, of a weak kind, fitted to my weakness. That is my anchor, if it will hold. Adieu, dear Mr. Erskine! Here has F.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">J. A.

<p>In my great darkness as to the fair young Blanche&#x02019;s affairs, how can I advise? I will say only: A young lady&#x02019;s chief duty and outlook is not to write novels<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Atkinson wrote later: &#x0201C;It seems to me, looking back across all these years, almost incredible that the idea of writing to Mr. Carlyle (of all people in the world!) to consult him as to the wisdom of continuing to write a novel upon which I was then engaged, should ever have entered my head. And to write to him <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, only six months after his wife&#x02019;s death, and to hope, however dimly, that he would really give the weighty matter his attention, was surely as wild a piece of presumption as even a conceited girl was ever guilty of! But the thought of the tremendous seriousness of life, and the fear that writing a novel was a foolish way of spending time, had laid hold upon me and could not be thrown off. On the other hand, I was ambitious. &#x02026; Already my heroine had gone through a course of &#x02018;Modern Painters&#x02019; and Ruskinism. My hero was in the very act of becoming acquainted with a clergyman of the type of Frederick Maurice, who was intended to bring him from the condition of the &#x02018;Everlasting No&#x02019; to the &#x02018;Everlasting Yes,&#x02019; and to the gospel of &#x02018;Sartor Resartus.&#x02019; / &#x02018;Write and ask Carlyle&#x02019;&#x02014;was the only thing I could think of to settle the question; and I wrote. I believe that my real hope was that he would answer, &#x02018;By all means go on. You write so beautifully, and your intentions are so good, that it would be a serious loss to the world to be without your novel&#x02019;&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi> 460).</note>
 (especially not while she is &#x02018;ignorant of the world,&#x02019; and not even perhaps when she knows it too well!)&#x02014;but, by-and-by, to be queen of a household, and to manage it queenlike and womanlike. Let her turn her whole faculty and industry in that direction; shove her own novel well aside for a good while, or forever; and be shy even of reading novels. If she do read, let it be good and wise books (more and more <hi rend="italic">exclusively</hi> those) which not one in ten thousand of the kind called &#x02018;novels&#x02019; now is.</p>

<p>Privately I have no belief that this &#x0201C;Jamaica Comittee,&#x0201D; with all its noises, will ever get to anything of practical. By a late glance I accidentally had into the heart of their affairs, it appears that, to venture on this precious &#x0201C;Prosecution,&#x0201D; they imperatively needed &#x000A3;10,000,&#x02014;and had not, so far as I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> judge, the slightest chance to get it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">The Jamaica Committee (see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18660823-TC-HH-01">

<p>I like this second letter better than the former;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">See <ref target="volume-44/lt-18661029-TC-BAT-01"><corr>TC to BAT, <date when="1866-10-29">29 Oct.</date></corr></ref> After receiving TC&#x02019;s letter of discouragement, Atkinson wrote: &#x0201C;I shed a few mortified tears over this complete extinguishing of my hopes; but I wrote my thanks for the advice, and promised to obey it, as far as concerned the shoving aside of my novel. I protested, however, against the idea that a girl&#x02019;s only outlook was to be towards marriage; and affirmed that to be &#x02018;queen of a household&#x02019; was not and could never be my chief desire in life. I was then visiting a widowed aunt, in whose school I liked to give a good deal of time to the pleasant work of teaching; and I told Mr. Carlyle that fact, and assured him that I loved &#x02018;good and wise books,&#x02019; and studied them as I had the opportunity. I wish I had kept a copy of my letter. I know it was written in warm earnestness; evidently something in it pleased him, for he wrote once more&#x02014;this lovely letter, and enclosed his photograph&#x0201D; (460).</note> better news for me that you are faithfully teaching your good aunt&#x02019;s school<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Atkinson&#x02019;s aunt (unidentified further) had a school at Farnworth, near Warrington.</note> than writing novels. And, furthermore, I see in you a spurt of proper maidenly pride, which is much to my mind; &#x02018;Quit the noble pride of thy heart never!&#x02019; (says Richter, to one who had grown nobly old <hi rend="italic">un</hi>-married). Not necessary to be married; but it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> necessary to live wisely and with dignity, to be true and useful, and to work well while it is called to-day!</p>
<p>In sum, therefore: Be a good, diligent, and prudent girl; summon up your own best judgement; vigilantly exercise it, &#x02018;eyes well open, lips oftenest well <hi rend="italic">shut</hi>;&#x02019; it is your own judgement alone, and no other person&#x02019;s, that can wisely guide your steps, wisely select your objects, and your methods towards them. I say, exercise <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, with pious fidelity; and loyally <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, in a courageous yet modest manner, without <hi rend="italic">loitering</hi>, what it audibly bids you; it will, on such terms (not on others) really and daily improve upon you, and become more luminous and trustworthy.</p>
<p>Married or not married, surely it is always fit and comely that a woman do know <hi rend="italic">domesticities</hi> to the bottom? One expects to find it of her, when need comes; as of a man, that he can resist when insulted.</p>
<p>Nor do I forbid you literature, if there absolutely be no better aim. But in that case, first <hi rend="italic">prepare</hi> for it: read, study, reflect; inquire far and near (perhaps in various ages, in various countries or <hi rend="italic">languages</hi>); become acquainted <pb id="pg-44-86" n="44:86"/>with the great souls that have been&#x02014;see if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have anything to add which is distinctly in their spirit; and if yes, do so.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Atkinson later published several novels and stories for children.</note></p>
<p>And now let us be silent, dear Blanche&#x02014;for that is best, on both sides;&#x02014;and never doubt but I do wish you well, and feel obliged by your regard of me. In token of which fact, here is the shadow of my old face, come as if to assure you of it. Farewell; and may a good genius guide you.</p>

<p>I did not understand that Jamie&#x02019;s Offer of rent rested at all on the Walker<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Mr. Walker not further identified.</note> <hi rend="italic">valuat</hi>n, but on his own deliberate estimate (formed during <hi rend="italic">many years</hi>) of what the place might be worth to him,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> latter estimate I consider fairly <hi rend="italic">likelier</hi> than Walker&#x02019;s to be <hi rend="italic">true</hi>. If <hi rend="italic">you</hi> think the utmost study of Walker can throw any New or diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> light on Jamie&#x02019;s practical conclus<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, by all means let him see it, study it till he is satisfied, and then <hi rend="italic">revoke</hi> his Offer, to what extent he likes,&#x02014;he shall not be bound by this Offer at all, if he wishes to change!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am very sensible of the honour<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Farrar recalled later: &#x0201C;When I was at Harrow I founded one of those Scientific and Natural History Societies among the boys. &#x02026; I &#x02026; strongly felt that to see and hear great men was, in itself, a sort of liberal education for young boys. I therefore invited several men of great eminence to come and give us lectures. &#x02026; I was anxious that the boys should see and hear Carlyle, and I wrote to invite him to deliver a lecture. &#x02026; Carlyle was interested in my request, for he afterwards spoke about it to Professor Tyndall, who told me that when he informed the Sage of Chelsea of his intended lecture to the school, Carlyle answered in his deep voice, &#x02018;Mind you don&#x02019;t tell them anything which is not true!&#x02019;&#x0201D; (Farrar 272&#x02013;73). Farrar gave a lecture, &#x0201C;On Some defects in Public School Education,&#x0201D; at the Royal Institution, <date when="1867-02-8">8 Feb. 1867</date>; he dedicated the printed pamphlet of it to Tyndall.</note> you do me; and surely sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be well pleased, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I do y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> young people any good at all:&#x02014;but regret to ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> that, especially in present circumstances, such an enterprise is not practicable to me.</p>

<salute>Dear Anne,</salute>
<p>I heard two days [ago], without least hint [before], that Grace had fallen ill of liver; was confined to bed [. &#x02026;] long hitherto, and that, as natural, you were all in anxiety, and she in much suffering.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Maggie Welsh wrote to TC, <date when="1866-11-09">9 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;[Mary, Maggie&#x02019;s sister] went out one day to see the Miss Welsh&#x02019;s &#x02003; I am grieved, as I am sure you will be too, to hear that poor Miss Grace has been very unwell indeed for some little time back. She was entirely confined to her bed when Mary was there; it seems to be some very bad attack from the liver, which they fear is very much out of order.&#x0201D; Maggie then reported, <date when="1866-11-13">13 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;[Grace] has been entirely confined to bed for five weeks. If she tries to stand even for a moment she gets quite faint &#x02003; breathless &#x02003; suffers much from pain in the side &#x02003; chest. &#x02026; [The doctors] seem quite certain that there is nothing wrong with the heart or the lungs, but that the liver is terribly out of order; &#x02003; truly nothing need to be worse than <hi rend="italic">that</hi>. &#x02026; Poor Miss Grace has had many severe illnesses &#x02003; one would fain hope she may yet rally from this. Miss Ann says they have a most kindly &#x02003; obliging servant, which must be an unspeakable comfort at such a time, &#x02003; that she herself is even in better health than usual. Elizabeth, she says, is just as usual, very frail. I thought you would wish to hear about poor Grace &#x02003; so have troubled you with this.&#x0201D; Grace Welsh d. <date when="1867-02-15">15 Feb. 1867</date>.</note>
 All this is abundantly distressing; and to me the more so, as I have, all this while, been often think<supplied>[ing]</supplied> of <pb id="pg-44-93" n="44:93"/>Grace, and intending a Letter to her (if I ever wrote Letters) of [. &#x02026;] thanks for a kindness she had done me,&#x02014;in that clear <hi rend="italic">Summary of Dates</hi> belonging to a Kindred that will be ever precious and honourable to me; and ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> my tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> have continually turned, since that Document arrived and before.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Grace Welsh had written, <date when="1866-06-12">12 June</date>: &#x0201C;I send you as correct a list as I can make, of the dates of the births &#x02003; deaths of our poor short lived family. The births I easily got for they are all entered in our family Bible. But for the other sad events, I had to look for through a great many letters, &#x02003; papers&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1768.150). TC noted the next day: <hi rend="italic">&#x0201C;<date when="1866-06-13">june 13</date></hi>. This morning the adjoined Paper has come from Miss <hi rend="italic">Grace</hi> Welsh, youngest of the Three Aunts, in answer to our requests; which <hi rend="italic">ratifies</hi> some of the above dates, and chronological sequences. It is extracted &#x02018;from the Old Family Bible&#x02019; and other sure sources&#x0201D;; TC copied the list into his reminiscences (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 113&#x02013;15).

Do this, like a good &#x0201C;Aunt Anne&#x0201D;; and don&#x02019;t delay, I beseech you! That is the one errand I had today.</p>
<p>I have been very silent, all summer, and find it generally best to be so; solitary altogether rather than in company that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> what it calls &#x0201C;distract&#x0201D; me from my sad tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>.

 so that the <hi rend="italic">best</hi>, and clearly the one <hi rend="italic">good</hi> thing is, Come yourself.

<p>It appears I am actually to go to Mentone!

<p>My ultimate &#x0201C;Yes&#x0201D; has not yet been said, but I have pretty much ceased to say No;&#x02014;and Tyndall is emphatic and steady on the affirmative side. &#x0201C;Ready to fly off with you on dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 18; and will!&#x0201D; says he always.

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I read over that <hi rend="italic">half</hi>-signed <hi rend="italic">Lease</hi> the day before yesterday; and have had it disagreeably in my head ever since;&#x02014;not that there need be anything particularly disagreeable or painful, when one hopes all is easily rectifiable: only, I found at once, and find more and more clearly ever since, that I cannot, and must not, sign the Lease in its pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> form; and also <hi rend="italic">what</hi> the <hi rend="italic">fault</hi> of it is to me. The one fault is, The introduct<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of anything belonging to Paterson the &#x0201C;valuator&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">For Mr. Paterson, see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18660802-TC-JAC-01">

 or to his suggestions; the whole of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> were unknown to me, and insignificant to me; the one point I cared about being that the sum <hi rend="italic">he</hi> fixed upon as rent was also y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> sum.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A. Carlyle had written to James Carlyle, <date when="1866-11-02">2 Nov.</date>, advising him to agree to Paterson&#x02019;s valuation of the annual rent.</note>
 Once hearing that, I had no vestige more of curiosity, and have never to this hour opened his Paper, nor probably shall. I understood and understand him to be a man of judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> on those matters, but not probably of better judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> than (for example) <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>; and certainly of no judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Craigenputtock (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he had seen only for a few hours) worth <hi rend="italic">the tenth part</hi> of Y<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> who have known it in all practical phases and forms for <pb id="pg-44-105" n="44:105"/>many years!

<p>1&#x000B0;. Lease of Craigen<hi rend="italic">k</hi> for 19 years; rent &#x000A3;250.</p>
<p>2&#x000B0;. To put the Farm into the old vigour, out of its now exhausted state, I am to pay for, and you are to cart, 4,000 bushels of good lime (about 10<hi rend="italic">d per</hi>) to throw upon it,&#x02014;with liberty to you, in a cert<hi rend="italic">n degree</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I think ought to be more clearly <hi rend="italic">defined</hi> than it yet is in Adamson&#x02019;s Paper), to take instead of lime, bone manure (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> requires no cartage, or almost none?)&#x02014;</p>
<p>3&#x000B0;. That Fences, House and Offices are to be put in perfect tenantable order by me, and by you kept so. (My task, in this respect, appears to be fully double of what I had lazily guessed it might be: but you know what I have said in regard to all that; you yourself, and y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own honest judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, shall be satisfied in regard to all that).</p>
<p>This, so far as I know, is all the Bargain I have made with you, or intended to make.</p>
<p>That of undertaking &#x0201C;to lay out &#x000A3;200 on <hi rend="italic">new</hi> fencing &#x02003; draining&#x0201D; is a point wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I never heard of till the morning before yesterday; and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I by no means contemplat<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, or contemplate. if at a future time when <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have thoroughly investigated, you fairly discern that a special bit of New draining or new fencing will be a good invest<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, &#x02003; permanently worth its cost to the Farm, I shall (tho&#x02019; there has already been <hi rend="italic">twice as much</hi> money laid out on it, in <pb id="pg-44-106" n="44:106"/>that form, as ever paid interest for itself) be very apt to listen to you, and, on having estimates, specificat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> &#x02003;c &#x02003;c, to do what is handsome and desirable. But I never understood myself to be <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> in that partic<hi rend="italic">r</hi>;&#x02014;and in Paterson&#x02019;s vague form, I certainly will not bind myself: such a Clause of Lease, so far as I can see, having no tendency except to create haggles and litigat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> were the two parties (by any bad chance) inclined that way.</p>
<p>Still more exceptionable, and at once rejectable, seems that Clause of P.&#x02019;s ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x0201C;the Woods&#x0201D;. My Nephew James and I are agreed on a certain plan ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the woods:&#x02014;and if he care to write it out with brevity and clearness, I have no object<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to sign it, and say for behoof of those that come after me, &#x0201C;This was <hi rend="italic">my</hi> plan; now follow <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>, if you think better!&#x0201D; But the Tenant, as Tenant, has nothing to do with the Woods,&#x02014;except to keep his Cattle out of them; to see that the fences are entire, and are maintained entire, to guard ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the least harm from his cattle: that is his whole duty in regard to the woods.</p>
<p>And this, dear Brother, is all I have to say at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. I have studied to make it as coldly definite and unmistakably plain as I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> (it being of the nature of a &#x0201C;record&#x0201D; in the interim). if on considerat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, you can comply with all this, I will ask you to forward the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Note to John our Brother at Dumfries,&#x02014;whom I am grieved to trouble farther with this matter, and am in truth <hi rend="italic">ashamed</hi> to have troubled so much;&#x02014;he will then see clearly what his way in it is. If you have, on the contrary, objections, I don&#x02019;t know (at this moment) what it will be best to do. <salute>Y<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> ever truly /</salute>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We are going on well enough here; Jean safe with us, &#x02003; beginning to venture out into London and its sights. <hi rend="italic">Mentone</hi> is not yet at all absolutely <hi rend="italic">cert</hi>n; and I begin to shudder sensibly at the horrors of such a journey,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; Tyndall is positive, &#x02003; yet, for himself, will only stay there &#x0201C;six hours&#x0201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Tyndall recalled later: &#x0201C;The Mentone scheme he deemed at first clearly impracticable; but the more it was thought over the more evident it became that it was the only really practicable course open to him. As the gloom of December set in, the necessity of getting him away from London became more and more apparent. Counting the days at my disposal, I found that it was within my power to convey him to Mentone, deposit him there, and return in time for my personal duties in the Royal Institution&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 20).</note> Day before<pb id="pg-44-107" n="44:107"/>yesterday I wrote to L<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Ashb<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; promising to ans<hi rend="italic">r Yes</hi> or No, on receipt of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to these practical queries of mine. The weather here is often nasty, and for two months will not improve; but, in all other points, one may easily go farther &#x02003; fare worse. Her ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> will determine mine; and so, at least <hi rend="italic">end</hi> this speculat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.</p>
<p>I read the Lease some days ago, and have given it what considerat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> I could. The pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Lease will not do at all;&#x02014;perhaps the price of Stamp can be recovered; if not, it must be forfeited: for a new Lease will have to be written by and by. I wrote yesterday to Jamie,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">See <ref target="volume-44/lt-18661207-TC-JC-01"><corr>TC to JC, <date when="1866-12-07">7 Dec.</date></corr></ref></note> explaining with considerable lab<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and minuteness <hi rend="italic">what</hi> I understood myself to have bargained for, and what I had not or yet c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> bargain for: you will see the Letter so soon as he has done with it, and if (as I hope) he prove compliant, the course (and tenor of new Lease) will be brief &#x02003; easy. I require only that Mr Paterson (whose suggest<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> I never heard of, and still put no trust in, compared with Jamie&#x02019;s own) be entirely marched out of the Document,&#x02014;his proposals (did one even <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> to adopt them) being in such <hi rend="italic">a shape</hi> as c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be admitted into any <hi rend="italic">Lease</hi>, or Docum<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that is to guard <hi rend="italic">ag</hi>t litigat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> or liability that way!

John A. Carlyle wrote to James Carlyle Jr., <date when="1866-12-11">11 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;[TC] sent back the Lease to me &#x02003; I have it here. On the margins of it are notes of the alterations he wishes to have made; &#x02003; along with it I had a short letter in which he refers me to what he had said in the letter to your Father. That letter, I daresay, you will have received by this time. I feel sure your uncle wants to do only what is just &#x02003; right, but he is very imperfectly acquainted with the circumstances. If we all keep our tempers, the thing may yet be arranged satisfactorily; &#x02003; of course I shall be ready to do anything I can in the matter. I at once told your uncle that I considered the &#x000A3;200 for new drains &#x02003; dykes an essential item of the Valuation; but that I thought your Father cared little or nothing what arrangements might be made about plantations. Perhaps you may be able to send your uncle a direct &#x02003; temperate &#x02003; distinct reply to his letter whatever it may be. I dont feel certain that I have any more power in the matter. I did the very best I could for both parties, &#x02003; that is my comfort whatever comes of it&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note>&#x02014;</p>
<p>If you return this Lease to Mr Adamson, bid him reflect on that <hi rend="italic">marginale</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Common &#x02003; the torn-down fences; I am quite in earnest ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it,&#x02014;especially after y<hi rend="italic">g</hi> Jamie&#x02019;s report (in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter to Jean).

Mazzini had mentioned to Emilie Venturi, <date when="1866-06-11">11 June</date>, that &#x0201C;somebody translated the <hi rend="italic">Questione Morale</hi> [Mazzini&#x02019;s title for &#x0201C;The Religious Side&#x0201D;] and offered it to Lewes&#x0201D; for the <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review</hi>; George Henry Lewes (<date when="1817">1817</date>&#x02013;<date when="1878">78</date>; <ref target="volume-44/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16562"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) refused it as too &#x0201C;exclusively Italian&#x0201D; (Mazzini, <hi rend="italic">Scritti</hi> 83:185). Although Venturi did not apparently translate it, perhaps she had copied it to send to Froude. She translated many of Mazzini&#x02019;s writings and wrote various articles about him, but no articles either by or about Mazzini were pbd. in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x02019;s Magazine</hi>.</note></p>
<p>You have therefore nothing to do but send it at once (Address is, J. A. Froude Esq, / 5. Onslow Gardens /<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC&#x02019;s slashes.</note> Brompton), and send y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own or some other person&#x02019;s Address, to whom it can be returned, in the <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> state or the <hi rend="italic">rejected</hi>,&#x02014;let us hope, in the former. Froude will judge it with a very clear eye to all its qualities; but the deciding quality will be, its value or non-value for readers of <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>.</p>
<p>Mentone is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> decided yet,&#x02014;except that on dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 21 I must either be on the road or have given it up.&#x02014; &#x02014; Are you wet in the country?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Emilie Venturi was visiting Harriet H. King, Manor House, Chigwell, Essex (12 mi. [19 km.] NE of Charing Cross, London), <date when="1866-12-08">8 Dec.</date>&#x02013;<date when="1866-12-22">8&#x02013;22 Dec.</date>; she then returned home to 14 Milburne Grove, Brompton, which was not far from Cheyne Row.</note> You cannot be wetter than we!&#x02014;</p>

Which intention I will execute, with my best skill, if I live; my notion at present being that of Endowments for Edinburgh University; but my light on the subject being yet incomplete Fixed only is one point: that those, or whatever Endowments I may decide on, are to bear, as the first part of their Title, <hi rend="italic">&#x0201C;The John-Welsh</hi>&#x0201D; So-and-so, &#x0201C;John-Welsh Bursaries,&#x0201D; &#x0201C;John-Welsh Fellowships,&#x0201D; &#x02003;c.

And now, if I be called away before it is done, I hereby request and commission my dear Brother John to act, with all his judgement, instead of me, and to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> whatever I may have left undone in this matter,&#x02014;which he knows well is a sacred one to me. If alive, he will not fail, such his love of me; if not, then my other Brothers &#x02003;c.

Nay all friends advise and exhort to the enterprise; and a good Country Sister of mine (&#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Craw</hi> Jean,&#x0201D; as we called her in childhood, the only <hi rend="italic">blackhaired</hi> one of us, or Mrs Aitken, Dumfries, as she is now called) has been here for some days past;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1866-12-13">13 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;Sister Jean has come on visit from Dumfries (this her 8th day here): very affectionate, has sense too, much sense, but in a type considerably foreign to me at this date.

<p>So that, if you hear <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> farther, much more if you do hear something confirmatory, fancy Tyndall and me fairly <hi rend="italic">on the road</hi>, this day week, dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 21: to rest at Paris one day; thence to Lyon, with <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> another days pause (but that is left uncert<hi rend="italic">n</hi>); thence to Marseille, with or with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>; and at length, thro&#x02019; the 150 miles of <hi rend="italic">tunnel</hi>, emerge at Nice,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Between <date when="1858">1858</date> and <date when="1862">1862</date> the Compagnie des Chemins de Fer de Paris à Lyon et à la M&#x000E9;diterran&#x000E9;e (PLM) connected Paris by rail with the C&#x000F4;te d&#x02019;Azur.

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I am here safe; and ought, if my shaking hand, and new pen and condit<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> will allow, to send you instant intelligence of that fact wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will be so comfortable to you. I have suffered little almost nothing in comparison to what I expected; in truth I seem to have taken no real harm what<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and expect in the course of the next 4 or 5 days, to have shaken all the dust out of me, got my things into something of order ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and to do really well in this fine <hi rend="italic">summer</hi> country, with such a hearty welcome of affection as awaited my coming.</p>
<p>We left Paris (as Tyndall&#x02019;s little Note w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> predict to you) on Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> at 11 a.m.; <hi rend="italic">sat</hi> the rail for 17 hours,&#x02014;carriage all to ourselves and every possible help from the daring inventive and successful Tyndal;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Tyndall later provided a detailed description of their journey: &#x0201C;Rime was in the air, sucking the vital warmth out of every living thing when we started on the morning of the <date when="1866-12-22">22nd of December</date>. A raw breeze blew in our faces as we crossed the Channel. &#x02026; I tried to muffle him up; but immediately resigned my attempted task to a young lady who wound and pinned his comforter in a manner unattainable by me. Carlyle was interested to learn that his kind protectress was the daughter of Sir John Herschel [<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x02013;<date when="1871">1871</date>; <ref target="volume-44/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13101">

She was &#x02026; Miss Amelia Herschel [<date when="1841">1841</date>&#x02013;<date when="1926">1926</date>]. &#x02026; In Paris we spent the night at the Grand Hotel de St. James, Rue St. Honor&#x000E9;. A bad sleeper myself, I had long before chosen this hotel, because its bedrooms opened into a garden. We were well lodged; but some slight creak or clatter of a loose window roused Carlyle, who became vocal. Noise at night was a terror and a torture to him. I rose, reproved and corrected the peccant window, the night afterwards passing quietly. Next morning we started. &#x02026; In England, as stated, the weather was harsh; it continued so in France. &#x02026; Throughout the day the landscape was cut off by freezing mist, and at the Lyons station the outlook was specially dismal; due precautions however had been taken against cold. In view of my winter expedition to the Mer de Glace in <date when="1859">1859</date> I had purchased a sheepskin bag, lined with its own wool, and provided with straps to attach it comfortably to the waist. Swathed with this to the hips, such heat as he could generate was preserved for his feet and limbs&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 20&#x02013;21).</note>&#x02014;and ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 6 on Sunday <pb id="pg-44-113" n="44:113"/>morning, saw that the dirty raw-frosty vapours, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had continued with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a moment&#x02019;s interrupt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> from London onward, had fled quite away; and that a beautiful <hi rend="italic">summer</hi> sunrise was colouring the western horizon, and that we were close upon Marseilles and the Mediterranean. Beautiful &#x02003; strange the difference of climate. We strolled ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Marseilles all forenoon,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Tyndall wrote: &#x0201C;On opening our eyes in the morning we found a deep-blue sky above us, and a genial sun shining on the world. The change was surprising; we had obviously reached &#x02018;the Sunny South.&#x02019; / We rested at Marseilles, and walked through the sunlit city. Carlyle seated himself on a bench in the shade of trees, while I went back to our hotel. On returning I found him in conversation with a paralysed beggar boy, from whom he had extracted the sad story of his life&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 21).</note>&#x02014;strangest of exotic seaports; lanes uglier and darker than anything in old Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and close by, streets squares, <hi rend="italic">parks</hi> (i.e. Clumps of excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> old wood, in fine broad avenues) equal to anything in London or New Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">The New Town of Edinburgh built to the N of Princes St. from the late 18th century into the 19th century.</note> (Louis Nap<hi rend="italic">n</hi> has pulled down &#x02003; rebuilt both Paris and Marsll<hi rend="italic">es</hi>, and I believe many other cities,&#x02014;thanks to him for that anyway!)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Louis Napoleon Bonaparte (<date when="1808">1808</date>&#x02013;<date when="1873">73</date>), emperor of France <date when="1852">1852</date>&#x02013;<date when="1870">70</date>, oversaw the modernization of the French economy, both agricultural and industrial, and major rebuilding of many towns and cities, including Paris and Marseille.</note>&#x02014; To Nice from Marseilles in 6 hours; &#x0201C;start 12&#x02013;17 <hi rend="italic">p</hi>.m.,&#x0201D; said the Program; but delays &#x02003;c occurred; we did not get to Nice till near 8 p.m;&#x02014;and by that time, on New and more stringent inquiries as to the Marseilles Nice-Paris <hi rend="italic">post-office</hi> courses, had come to the conclusion that the letter we had written from Paris to Lady A. <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had had the start of <hi rend="italic">us</hi> by 14 hours + 6 (of our Marseilles <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi>) that is, by 20 hours in all, was, most probably still in the <hi rend="italic">same train</hi> with ourselves keeping us steady company! (As proved to be the fact; letter arriving, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> morning an hour after breakfast!)&#x02014; We had in consequence some bother at Nice, getting post-horses &#x02003;c; but <hi rend="italic">telegraphed</hi> at once to Mentone, &#x0201C;Coming tonight&#x0201D;;&#x02014;and did at length get under way, tho&#x02019; such a road for <hi rend="italic">steepness</hi>, such a country for <pb id="pg-44-114" n="44:114"/>tumultuous rocky ruggedness, &#x02003; such a brilliancy of moon &#x02003; sky, as I had ever seen<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">Tyndall continued: &#x0201C;At Nice the railway came to an end, and a carriage was needed to take us over the hills to Mentone. We had a vigorous altercation at a cab-stand, where gross extortion was attempted. We retired to a respectable hotel, the courteous proprietor of which, after some waiting, provided us with the required vehicle. The lights of Monaco shone below us as we slowly crept over the hills. From the summit we trotted down to Mentone, reaching it at two o&#x02019;clock in the morning&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 22). J. Henry Bennet wrote in <date when="1860">1860</date>: &#x0201C;The ascent [from Nice to Menton] occupies about two hours, the descent about the same time. &#x02026; When the traveller &#x02026; begins to descend, a glorious panorama opens before him. The higher mountains, receding from a beautiful bay, open to the south-east, and form a magnificent amphitheatre, which at its centre recedes five or six miles from the sea. The bay, about four or five miles in circuit, is divided into two unequal portions by a hill, which gradually slopes to the sea, and on the sides of which climb the houses that constitute the old town of Mentone&#x0201D; (Bennet, &#x0201C;Winter at Mentone&#x0201D; 2).

The reception was such as a younger man might envy. It was indeed plain to me that the storm-tossed barque had reached a haven in which it could safely rest&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 22). Lady Ashburton was staying at the Villa Madonna.</note>&#x02014; I got in my strange new bed &#x02003; rooms (beautiful, but strange, strange!)&#x02014;and actually slept ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 5 hours sound as a stone. In the rail itself (<hi rend="italic">last</hi> half of the 17 hours), I slept immensely; in fact, am not ill off for sleep. I really do hope to get everything adjusted, &#x02003; do well here. Upholsterers are tumbling ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> putting up curtains &#x02003;c &#x02003;c.&#x02014; The weather is incredible; sky bright as steel, sun shining as in June,&#x02014;sea &#x02003; sand filling <hi rend="italic">Tyndall</hi> with &#x0201C;wonder &#x02003; amaze<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.&#x0201D;&#x02014; I find nothing wrong but my <hi rend="italic">pipes</hi> (long ones ⅔ <hi rend="italic">broken</hi>),&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">item</hi> no sleeved <hi rend="italic">grey</hi> winter-waistcoat (for the <hi rend="italic">nights</hi> seem to be really <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>): I can get one made, if needful.</p>

<salute>Good Mrs Warren,</salute>
<p>Will you send me the grey sleeved <hi rend="small-caps">waistcoat</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I used to wear daily), and the two <hi rend="italic">old Pieces of Flannel</hi> for the neck,&#x02014;the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> ones being far too big &#x02003; thick.&#x02014; Professor Tyndal is also to send a man who will try and pack me some pipes.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">At the foot of the page someone, presumably Sarah Warren, wrote: &#x0201C;Pipes &#x02003; waistcoat to[o] &#x02003; flannels sent to the Royal Institution Albemarle Street.&#x0201D; Tyndall later recalled, &#x0201C;Over the packing of his pipes we had a wrangle.

He knew how to pack pipes, and would be answerable for their safety. Out of fifty thus packed at Cheyne Row, three only reached Mentone unbroken. I afterwards enjoyed the triumph of sending him fifty without a single fracture&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 20).

<salute>Dear James,</salute>
<p>I got your Letter yesterday ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> noon (Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> at London, Mentone Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> noon: mark that, pray!)&#x02014; Tyndall&#x02019;s Paris Letter sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have got to you at latest on Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, instead of &#x0201C;Monday morning,&#x0201D; had not some Official proved false. On the same Monday I wrote from here; what I hope y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Mother got duly. I am doing tolerably well; sleeping &#x02003;c, <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> &#x0201C;always till 2 p.m.&#x0201D;; the place thrice-hospitably put at my entire disposal; the <hi rend="italic">climate</hi>, scenery &#x02003;c far surpassing anything of that kind I ever saw before. Let this suffice Dumfries &#x02003; you, if I have room for no farther personal details,&#x02014;my time being very limited, this bout.&#x02014; &#x02014; Attend, however, to the following very punctually:</p>
<p>1&#x000B0;. The <hi rend="italic">Punches</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">The weekly satirical magazine <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi>, which the Carlyles had always forwarded to Betty Braid; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18650312-JWC-BB-01">

<p><pb id="pg-44-116" n="44:116"/>3&#x000B0;. The two <hi rend="italic">Magazines</hi>, monthly, you despatch always in a day or two, to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Uncle at Dumfries; who knows what to do with them next.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss"><hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x02019;s Magazine</hi>, sent regularly to Rev.

<p>4&#x000B0;. Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of the Letters is what we agreed upon.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">James Aitken Jr. listed TC&#x02019;s correspondents and summarized some of the letters; in his <date when="1867-01-02">2 Jan. 1867</date> letter, they included Sir George Sinclair, Charles A. Ward, the Scottish Central Association of Schoolmasters who wanted TC to speak <hi rend="italic">&#x0201C;at Falkirk</hi> &#x02018;in April next!&#x02019;&#x0201D; There was a 20-page letter from &#x0201C;a young English lady&#x0201D; who &#x0201C;has sent you <hi rend="italic">only 28 ounces of</hi> [her novel] to taste and advise her upon &#x02003; get published for her as she has neither money nor friends! I dropped back into the post at once addressed as she wished with the addition of the words &#x02018;not at home&#x02019; on it, of w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I doubt you approve. She &#x02018;wonders whether you are Scotch or English&#x02019;&#x02014;&#x02018;has only read your Edinburgh Address&#x02019; &#x02003; altogether it is the coolest piece of impudence in that way that I have ever seen but I am sorry to think you must have seen many such!&#x0201D; James also passed on that Ann Welsh sent TC (via her letter to Jean) &#x0201C;very kind regards &#x02003; thanks for your kind message&#x02014; Grace Welsh still very poorly&#x02014;sleeps ill.&#x0201D;</note>
 Better perhaps if you come every <hi rend="italic">Tuesday Ev</hi>g to Chelsea; and despatch y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> report next night; so that arrive here as the week ends. Better get some light <hi rend="italic">envelopes</hi> too (I tore y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter yesterday before I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> open it); <hi rend="italic">item</hi> thin <hi rend="italic">white</hi> paper,&#x02014;I myself like this <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> very ill.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">James Aitken Jr. replied, <date when="1867-01-02">2 Jan. 1867</date>, asking whether TC liked the paper his letter was written on &#x0201C;better than that you have &#x02003; I shall send you some.&#x0201D;</note></p>

<p>And now for a specific thing. Profess<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Tyndall has probably been at Chelsea before this time, and shewn Mrs Warren a scrap of my writing, in request of a <hi rend="italic">warm grey waistcoat</hi>, of old <hi rend="italic">neck-flannels</hi>, and if possible of some <hi rend="italic">Pipes</hi>.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss">See <ref target="volume-44/lt-18661226-TC-SWA-01"><corr>TC to SWA, <date when="1866-12-26">26 Dec.</date></corr></ref></note> Deduct these neck-flannels (I have already <hi rend="italic">got</hi> an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> pair that suit); and let all the rest be expedited what you &#x02003; Mrs W<hi rend="italic">n</hi> can. If the Pipes come, they will be very welcome; item the <hi rend="italic">waistcoat</hi>,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seems a little more possible. And now, in addit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, there is just one other thing wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are to undertake on the Tyndall score; this, namely:</p>
<p>Go, the evening you read what I am writing, over to Chelsea, and along with Mrs Warren seek out (in the dining-room it was left,&#x02014;or <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> Miss Bromley has it; but if so, ask <hi rend="italic">her</hi> &#x0201C;(32.

<p>I have bragged of my good Mrs Warren&#x02019;s skill in baking <hi rend="italic">Oat-cakes</hi>, so confidently, that certain great Ladies here, especially Lady Ashburton, who is by birth <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi>, have determined on securing, by an opportunity there now is, a stock of her manufacture in that kind. Be speedy therefore and expert; and [d]o y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> best! The instructions are as follows:</p>
<p>1. About 7 or 8 pounds of meal, baked into cakes; that is the quantity wanted. Choose a handy little deal-box, or get one somewhere, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will hold ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that quantity; bake y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> cakes, according to the real rules of art; and pack them there (as tightly as you can without much <hi rend="italic">breaking</hi> of them;&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">­vacancies</hi> may be filled with Old Newspaper or the like, for the long railway <hi rend="italic">shakes</hi> terribly!): you need not nail down the lid very <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> (only with tacks, or short nails); as perhaps the custom-house people may insist on looking into it.</p>

<p>(Be so good as post that Note for Mr Aitken<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">Presumably TC enclosed a note to James Aitken Jr. for Mrs. Warren to forward.</note> the day it comes.)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1867-01-20">20 Jan.</date>: <hi rend="italic">&#x0201C;Mentone</hi>, on the Riviera, <date when="1867-01-20">20 jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1867</date>,&#x02014;Am actually here, for almost a month past; came the day before Xmas, Prof<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Tyndal triumphantly bringing me; our recept<hi rend="italic">n</hi> &#x02026; was of the kindest, after our strange &#x02003; interest<hi rend="italic">g</hi> moonlight climb &#x02003; descent &#x02018;out of Gaul into Liguria.&#x02019; The heroic Tyndall w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have no whisper of paying <hi rend="italic">his</hi> expenses, tho&#x02019; hither and back they must have exceeded &#x000A3;20, and he came purely on my acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi>: some way or other I must make that poor part of the matter good. Xmas day, hot and bright, the gracious Lady took us all, on asses by the rugged cliffs &#x02003; <hi rend="italic">sierras</hi> to a village and peak called Saint-Agnore (strangest village in the world, with a strange old castle perched on the very point of the cliff and of it), where we <hi rend="italic">lunch&#x02019;d</hi>, in sight of the whole populat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, gathered round us like a theatre with pit, gallery and boxes,&#x02014;very civil, tho&#x02019; so eagerly curious;&#x02014;and in the ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> we all dined with a Lady Marion Alford, not known to me before, but elegant, gifted, and blandly high in her way,&#x02014;who indeed with her two Sons (Lord Brownlow &#x02003; Mr Cust, the former of whom seems tragically dying, poor y<hi rend="italic">g</hi> man!) are the only interesting (not utterly wearying and profitless) people I have met here. Tyndall set off homeward, the second day after: from Monaco, in the steamer to Nice, he wave us his farewell;&#x02014;&#x02003; is now, doubtless, deep in his <hi rend="italic">Lecturing</hi> operatn<hi rend="italic">s</hi> among the gloomy populatn<hi rend="italic">s</hi> of London, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has been in a plunge of snow &#x02003; &#x02018;hard winter&#x02019;. &#x02026; We here have nothing but beautiful weather, compounded of bright sun &#x02003; keen air; broken once or twice by copious gushes of warm rain, sometimes for many hours together;&#x02014;the <hi rend="italic">need</hi> of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is enormous, but the effect on our temperature &#x02026; is uniformly soon advantageous. &#x02026; / I ought to give some sketch of Mentone, and our sceneries and bits of adventures and experiences,&#x02014;some day perhaps, not this day. Gladstone, on return from Rome &#x02003; the Man of Sin [presumably Pope Pius IX (<date when="1793">1793</date>&#x02013;<date when="1878">1878</date>), whom he met <date when="1867-10-22">22 Oct. 1867</date>], was expected yesternight in one of our H&#x000F4;tels here: that was the mighty event. &#x02018;On tuesday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, if he will come,&#x02019; we are to see him here: <hi rend="italic">meinetwegen</hi> [so be it], if he will come;&#x02014;if he won&#x02019;t, <hi rend="italic">meinetwegen</hi> still. The great Earl Russell, too, passed this way, on the same journey, 3 weeks ago; &#x02003; <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have b<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (at Lady Marion&#x02019;s), but was not. &#x02026; / Monday, <date when="1867-01-21">21 jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>. Did go out yesterday; walked 2 or 3 miles, silently up the silent valley towd<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Gorbio; trifling wet of mist, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> hung in shifting <hi rend="italic">scarfs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">caps</hi> all about, among the peaks of the ravine; beautiful green of orange-woods and olive-woods; here and there a silent Olive-Mill, far down, in some nook of the bottom, nothing but its idle mill-race and the voice of the torrent audible; here and there a melancholy ill-kept little Chapel, too &#x02026; inviting the faithful to take view of the bits of idols inside, and try if prayers were possible. &#x02026; On nearing home, the sky suddenly broke; and for half an hour, or nearly so, there was (chiefly after I got into the house), one of the finest mellow outbursts of sunshine; painting Mentone Steeple &#x02003; Town bright yellowish <hi rend="italic">white</hi>, under its grey canopy of mist (beautiful even to me, who abhor scene-hunting). &#x02026; Dullish ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> indoors, especially latter part of it. Mrs B<hi rend="italic">n</hi> [Frances von Bunsen] (or <hi rend="italic">De</hi> B<hi rend="italic">n</hi> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say) is here with her Daughter [Emilia Bunsen], for a fortnight past; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is a fine intelligent kind of girl; but Madam (with much fine quality otherwise) is of trivial-didactic turn, and goes like a mild-gushing broad cascade, for hours long, in that kind; yielding more twaddle and weariness to the afflicted human soul!&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned). &#x0201C;Saint-Agnore&#x0201D; is presumably the village and castle of Sainte-Agnes, about 6 mi. (10 km.) NNW of Menton; the village is 2,700 ft. (800 m.) above sea level. Tyndall wrote to a friend, <date when="1867-01-20">20 Jan.</date>, about the trip to Sainte-Agnes: &#x0201C;On Xmas day Carlyle astride a donkey reached a height of 2000 feet accompanied by Lady A and her daughter. We had luncheon there. They returned &#x02003; I went on to the top of the highest &#x02026; whence I had a most glorious view of Alps and sea&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 14836.175).</note></p>

<p>You heard of my safe arrival in these parts, that the promises they made me seemed to be good. I am lucky to add that the promise has been kept so far that, outwardly and that in respect of sleep, &#x02003;c., I feel as if rather better than in Chelsea; certainly not worse. Sometimes for moments it almost seems as if I might perhaps recognise some actual vestige of better health in these favoured latitudes, and be again a little more alive than of late. But that is only for moments. In what is called &#x02018;spirits&#x02019; I don&#x02019;t seem to improve much, or, if improvement means increase of buoyancy or levity, to improve at all. How should I? In these wild silent ravines one&#x02019;s thoughts gravitate towards death and eternity with more proclivity than ever, and in the absence of serious human discourse, go back to the vanished past as the one profitable or dignified company.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC had been working on his reminiscences of Irving and of Jeffrey (see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670121-TC-SWA-01">

It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a marked relief; but I do not count on it,&#x02014;at bottom, don&#x02019;t <hi rend="italic">much</hi> regard it! Perhaps not over-much, My poor Life seems virtually as good as over; I have no heart or strength of <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> or of interest for further work:&#x02014;since my last loss, I feel lonesome in the earth, oh how lonesome, and solitary among my fellow-creatures, sometimes! The loss of <hi rend="italic">Her</hi> comes daily home to me, as the insuperable, as the loss of all;&#x02014; &#x02003; the heart, as before, knows <hi rend="italic">its own</hi> sorrow, if no other ought&#x02019;s do so; what can any other <hi rend="italic">help</hi>, even if he wished it. Oh, my Darling, sleep in the Abbey Kirk yonder, far away; only my sad thot<hi rend="italic">s</hi> of thy nobleness and thee keeping watch there!&#x02014; / I have finished the <hi rend="italic">Edw</hi>d <hi rend="italic">Irving</hi> &#x02018;reminiscences&#x02019;; and, yesterday, a short Paper of <hi rend="italic">Jeffrey</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>; both of these now lie labelled in bottom drawer of the big <hi rend="italic">looking-glass</hi> Press of my bedroom. It was <hi rend="italic">her</hi> con ex<hi rend="italic">n</hi> with them that chiefly impelled me; both are superficially, ill and poorly done, especially the <hi rend="italic">latter</hi>; but there is something of value for oneself in reawakening the sleep of the Past, and bringing old years carefully to survey ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> by our new eyes; a cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> solemn tenderness, too, in these two cases, dwell in it for me;&#x02014;and, in fine, doing anything not wicked is better than doing nothing. I must carefully endeavour to find out some new work for myself;&#x02014;but as yet am quite at a loss.&#x0201D; He continued, <date when="1867-01-21">21 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;This morning I feel dreadfully in want of some Task ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; and cannot yet find one&#x02014;nor is <hi rend="italic">this</hi> the way at all to do it.

<p>In beauty of situation, of aspect and prospect by sea and land, nothing can exceed us in the world. Mentone, old town and new, latter perhaps a hundred <pb id="pg-44-126" n="44:126"/><pb id="pg-44-127" n="44:127"/><pb id="pg-44-128" n="44:128"/>years old, former several <hi rend="italic">thousands</hi>, is built principally as a single street by the sea-shore, along the diameter of two beautiful semicircular little hollows, or half-amphitheatres, formed by the mountains which are the airiest wings of rocky peaks and cliffs, all terraced olive-clad, with sometimes an old castle and village. Castle visible like a bird-cage from the shore here, six miles off.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Possibly the castle above Sainte-Agnes, about 6 mi. (10 km.) NNW of Menton; for one of the more ornate graves in the two cemeteries above Old Menton, topped with a rotunda that looked like a bird cage, see 124; but the cemetery, around 2 mi. (3 km.) E. of the shore where TC was standing, was almost certainly not what he was describing.</note> I never saw so strangely beautiful a ring of peaks, especially this western one, which is still new to me every morning on stepping out. Western ring and eastern form in the middle, especially form at each <hi rend="italic">end</hi>, their bits of capes and promontories and projections into the sea, so that we sit in the hollow of an alcove, and no wind from the north can reach us at all; maritime Alps intercepting all frost and snow. Mentone proper, as diameter or street along the sea, is perhaps three-quarters of a mile long; a fair street of solid high houses, but part of it paved all through with big smooth whinstones, on which at evening all the population seem to gather; many asses, &#x02003;c., passing home with their burdens from the mountains, and many women, young and old with them, and thriftier, quieter, more cheerfully serious and innocent-looking set of poor people you never saw.</p>

Ever since, we have had the most atrocious weather, of which all sorts of accounts will of course have reached you&#x02014;which if there be any truth in the &#x02018;suave mari magno [it is pleasant to watch a storm at sea from the peace of the land; cf. Lucretius, <hi rend="italic">De Rerum Natura</hi> 2:1]&#x02019; must have made you, out yonder at Mentone, all the warmer and more comfortable. I went to Robert Landor&#x02019;s in a fog, the day before you left, and returned in a worse fog, the day after you left; and those two fogs settled me.

Our beautiful hilltops have been once or twice slightly powdered with snow, for a few hours of the bright morning; but that is not felt except as a pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> theatrical surprise, down here by the shore,&#x02014;where, especially if there fall now &#x02003; then a little <hi rend="italic">rain</hi>, our habit<hi rend="italic">l</hi> temperature is unsurpassable; like fine grey weather in an English may or june: as is the case today, for instance.

<p>Things continue all well, and as it were, at <hi rend="italic">their</hi> best, with me here.

<p>I will say nothing of Mentone Town or Neighb<hi rend="italic">d</hi>: you will figure us as situated along the fine shingly sea-beach, at the safe and sheltered bottom of an <hi rend="italic">alcove</hi> (properly 2 alcoves) in the beautiful outskirt and finis of the Maritime Alps, with the wild ragged peaks visible as if almost at arm&#x02019;s-length, tho&#x02019; six miles away, so pure is the air and the light; their bare savage tops, and their ample multiform green <hi rend="italic">petticoats</hi> (of Olive Orange &#x02003;c) are certainly the airiest, strangest &#x02003; most <hi rend="italic">picturesque</hi> bit of Earth I ever set eyes on: really quite a kind of pleasure to me, in the bright morning when I first sally out to recover heat!

Nay with a sky <hi rend="italic">grey</hi>, and the white mists climbing ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> among them, like hoods, like neckcloths and scarves,&#x02014;I like right well to look at them,&#x02014;to walk among them; as I have done on such a day; so silent are they, so mysterious and mournful, with perhaps some Convent bell jangling out of the unknown distance for a minute or two, awakening tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> beyond this world!&#x02014; Up the ravines is generally some, roughly paved passable <hi rend="italic">Ass</hi>-path, sole <hi rend="italic">highway</hi> to the Hill Villages; there I pretty often go, and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go oftener, were my limbs &#x02003; feet better:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss">For TC&#x02019;s walk towards Gorbio, <date when="1867-01-20">20 Jan.</date>, see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670121-TC-SWA-01"><corr>TC to SWA, <date when="1867-01-21">21 Jan.</date></corr></ref> Bennet described this area: &#x0201C;The space between the sea and the receding mountains, which are between 3000 and 4000 feet high, is occupied by a series of lower hills, which slope gently to the shore, and which are divided by numerous ravines and torrential valleys&#x0201D; (Bennet, &#x0201C;Winter at Mentone&#x0201D; 2).</note> in bad weather, I prefer the carriage road (excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> highway, from Nice to Genoa, blasted out &#x02003; maca­damed by Napol<hi rend="italic">n</hi> I),<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss">Le chemin de la Corniche, the road linking Nice and Genoa, was opened, <date when="1812">1812</date>, by Napoleon I (<date when="1769">1769</date>&#x02013;<date when="1821">1821</date>), emperor of France <date when="1804">1804</date>&#x02013;<date when="1814">14</date>.</note> part of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> may be made to alternate with &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Promenades</hi>&#x0201D; &#x02003; streets by the sea-shore. &#x0201C;Bad weather,&#x0201D; I said, but meant merely <hi rend="italic">rain</hi> (of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, after long &#x02003; ruinous drought, there has been much more than usual at this season); and don&#x02019;t at all dislike that,&#x02014;except only the <hi rend="italic">mud</hi> of it, <pb id="pg-44-137" n="44:137"/>&#x02003; the bother while it lasts.

<salute>Dear Maggy</salute>,&#x02014;I duly got y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter and kind Gift; just in the struggle (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was furious <hi rend="italic">and</hi> miserable) of deciding Yes or No as to this place;&#x02014;and didn&#x02019;t calculate on leaving it so long unacknowledge<supplied>[d]</supplied>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Letter omitted.</note>

<p>It is a long time since I last wrote to you; and a long distance in space and in fortune,&#x02014;from the shores of the Solway in summer <date when="1865">1865</date>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC last wrote to Emerson <date when="1865-06-14">14 June 1865</date>; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650614-TC-RWE-01"><sic>42:79</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1865-06-14">14 June 1865</date></corr></ref>.</note> to this niche of the Alps and Mediterranean today, after what has befallen me in the interim! A longer interval, I think, and surely by far a sadder, than ever occurred betw<hi rend="italic">n</hi> us before, since we first met in the Scotch moors, some five and thirty years ago.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">They first met at Craigenputtoch <date when="1833-08">Aug. 1833</date>; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330827-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:425</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-08-27">27 Aug. 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> You have written me various Notes too, and Letters,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">For two of Emerson&#x02019;s letters, see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660124-TC-JAC-01"><sic>43:117</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1866-01-24">22 [24] Jan. 1866</date>

You will think me far gone, and much bankrupt in hope and heart;&#x02014;and indeed I am, as good as without hope and without fear; a gloomily serious, silent and sad old man; gazing into the final chasm of Things, in mute dialogue with &#x0201C;Death Judgement and Eternity&#x0201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Cf. John 5:24.</note> (dialogue <hi rend="italic">mute</hi> on <hi rend="italic">both</hi> sides!), not caring to discourse with poor articulate-speaking fellow creatures on <hi rend="italic">their</hi> sorts of topics. It is right of me;&#x02014;&#x02003; yet also it is not right. I often feel that I had better be dead than thus indiff<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, contemptuous, disgusted with the world and its roaring nonsense, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have no tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> farther of lifting a finger to help, and only try to keep out of the way of, and shut my door ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. But the truth is, I was nearly killed by that hideous Book on Friedr<hi rend="italic">h</hi>,&#x02014;12 years in continuous wrestle with the nightmares and the subterranean hydras;&#x02014;nearly <hi rend="italic">killed</hi>, and had often tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be altogether, and must die having the monster not so much as finished! This is one truth, not so evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to any friend or onlooker as it is to myself: and then there is another, known to myself alone, as it were; and of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am <pb id="pg-44-141" n="44:141"/>best not to speak to others, or to speak to them no farther. By the calamity of April last, I lost my little all in this world; and have no soul left who can make any corner of the world into a <hi rend="italic">home</hi> for me any more. Bright, heroic, tender, true and noble was that lost treasure of my heart, who faithfully accompanied me in all the rocky ways &#x02003; climbings; and I am forever poor with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> her. She was snatched from me in a moment,&#x02014;as by a death from the gods. Very beautiful her death was; radiantly beautiful (to those who understood it) had all her life been: <hi rend="italic">quid plura</hi> [what more]? I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be among the dullest &#x02003; stupidest if I were not among the saddest of all men. But not a word more on all this.</p>
<p>All summer last, my one solacement in the form of work was writing, and sorting of old documents and recollect<hi rend="italic">ns;</hi> summoning out ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> into clearness old scenes that had now closed on me with<hi rend="italic">t return.</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC wrote his reminiscences of JWC between <date when="1867-05-25">25 May</date> and <date when="1867-07-28">28 July 1867</date>; see <ref target="volume-44/lt-1867729-TC-JF-01"><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1867-07-29">29 July 1867</date></corr></ref>.</note> Sad, and in a sense sacred; it was like a kind of worship; the only devout time I had had for a great while past.

I have been dismally sad, several of these days; the Irreparable returning on me, time after time, as if I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> repair it!

How precious is one mortal creature capable of becoming to us, at once, or by degrees: it strikes me sometimes, lately, as wonderful, unaccountable; and I do not here express the precise and as yet not quite articulate meaning of my tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> on it. Oh my Jeannie, my darling little bit of nobleness and love, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> gave its radiance to all my day,&#x02014;what of radiance the day still had, and now hasn&#x02019;t!&#x02014; Was all the force of love that was in me to be turned, then, upon One who is now in the Eternal Kingdom, and can never know it, or take joy in it more? to display itself as sorrow &#x02003; silent lamentat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and to my own consciousness alone? It is tragical, most sad; but it may be salutary too. Be it so; it lay in the strange fate of me.&#x02014; I sometimes think there may be in this abstruse element, of utter loneliness, of pain and fret and paltriness, in a world all gone to shadows, there may be a lesson getting slowly taught me?&#x02014; / To work, however!

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I fully designed to write yesterday; but was interrupted by the trifles too common here; wherefore I have taken it up today the first thing, and will put it beyond the reach of such accid<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>. Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was very kind and affectionate, did me a great deal of good, on its arrival the morning before yesterday (Thursday morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>). I observe that when you <hi rend="italic">fill</hi> y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> sheet, y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letters are far more agreeable, even in the separate parts of them. If there be even no news, as happily there cannot be much from y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> still locality so long as all (by Heaven&#x02019;s mercy) continues well, yet the very effort to be liberal in quantity necessitates more reflexion, and the tone of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> feeling at least comes out, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> to a solitary heart is the best result of all. For above a fortnight past, till some 3 days ago, I have, owing to mere insignificancies, of my own poor bringing into play, been a good deal bothered, and annoyed in the way of sleeping and all that depends on it; &#x02003; in my gloomy moods have felt often enough, very lonesome, forsaken, and of little use farther in the world.&#x02014; I am ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> got back to my usual state or above it; and the matter, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you may have heard of thro&#x02019; James, was never of moment: but I had better tell you of it outright, that it may not get into any of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> fancies &#x02003; there play tricks.</p>
<p>The fountain of all (or at least the visible fount<hi rend="italic">n</hi>) was that contemptible <hi rend="italic">corn</hi> on the little toe, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is already known to you! I know not what sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have hurt it here; I had my old Chelsea shoes, <hi rend="italic">gutta-perchas</hi> especially, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> did tolerably well there; and, except finding my stockings all in a rather feeble state of <hi rend="italic">darning</hi>, and no clear method of ordering anybody to darn them <hi rend="italic">truly</hi>, <pb id="pg-44-144" n="44:144"/>I had nothing to complain of in the matter of shoeing. So it was, however, the right little <hi rend="italic">toe</hi> (sorrow on him, with his two corns, a <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> always actual, and a <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> always potent<hi rend="italic">l</hi>) got into sorrow &#x02003; irritat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I, too stoically, ignored; forcing him to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> insignificant duty, regardless of complaints: upon wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he rebelled utterly; took to prickling, twinging, when I went to bed, and fairly forbade sleep, or next to altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> forbade. This was the prologue to&#x02014;you guess all what. For ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 10 nights I was up in the short hours, smoking, sorrowfully stumbling ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1867-01-28">28 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not well be worse-fitted, in regard of health &#x02003;c (kept awake all night or nearly so, nay be exact, I did sleep in pieces for ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 3 hours, tho&#x02019; very miserable genll<hi rend="italic">y</hi>, and 3 times <hi rend="italic">up</hi>, smoking, <hi rend="italic">nail-brushing</hi> with soap my wretched prickle-prickling little-toe, and its <hi rend="italic">pair of</hi> CORNS, the contemptible cause of so much misery: what a piece of work is man!

This was one of the many careful <hi rend="italic">corn</hi>-prescript<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> of Dr Frank; this one proved truly valuable, &#x02003; I will keep this in mind: the rest, after bothering over a week, I wholly dismissed as inexecutable in given circ<hi rend="italic">s</hi>; and took to my own methods with that old devil of a toe. Cut out, namely, a beautiful oval <hi rend="italic">hole</hi> in one of those old gutta-percha shoes; &#x02003; set all the others (including a new Ital<hi rend="italic">n</hi> pair, of fine soft leather, but too strait in that sore part, in spite of my prayers) resolutely aside; got a <hi rend="italic">corn-plaster</hi> from James&#x02019;s Letter, and am now wearing it with success:&#x02014;c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I have got a <hi rend="italic">shoemaker to hang</hi> on the highest gallows in Europe, with this inscript<hi rend="italic">n</hi> &#x0201C;For incessantly tormenting his fellow-men!&#x0201D; it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have completed the recipe!

<p>I continue to like this place as well as ever; and am getting more adjusted into my circ<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, and abler to make the most of what capabilities there are. I try to &#x0201C;work&#x0201D; a little daily, that is, have paper before me,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; it is flattery to call it by any name betokening labour as result: but the process or attempt does something to still me, and I do not neglect it: till 2, I am (theoretically, and indeed practically for most part) invisible here. In my late <hi rend="italic">dietetic</hi> tempest, I have substituted tea for Coffee; make excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Tea always, out of the crazy and crank machinery; and find it much better than the Coffee, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> never rise above the character of tolerable with contempt. I am thinking to give up my morning egg too, as there is always the cup of fair potage at 2 p.m. before going out. Dinner is at 7; but I believe, I shall never quite reconcile my poor digestive-apparatus to that bad hour. Another duty rigorous upon me is that of walking ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 2 hours: we have a dashing carriage &#x02003; pair, with plenty of confused swift-driving (when I care to accompany); but how<hi rend="italic">r</hi> much of that there have been, I always make it set me down, 4 miles or so from home at least. Jean&#x02019;s thick cape does excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> service in the carriage; I always leave it there; and put an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Shetland Comforter in my pocket (weight hardly two or 3 ounces), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is effectual plentifully if sunset overtake me Jean can tell poor Symington this, i.e. tell his Wife<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">Andrew J.

These two duties, that of writing something &#x02003; that of walking 4 miles (by myself in preference), I reckon to embrace all the strict requisit<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> of my poor day: the rest comes as it can; and the only thing constant is the effort to shirk being bored,&#x02014;to shirk so far as possible, for a large allowance of that is not to be avoided anywhere; at Chelsea latterly, it was fast becoming far too large!&#x02014; Everybody is kind to me; nothing can exceed the industry, patience, and continual contrivance of my hospitable Lady A.;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss">Thomas Woolner reported to a friend, <date when="1867-02-09">9 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;I saw Carlyle at Mentone and was delighted to find the dear fellow in good spirits, and Lady Ashburton was rejoiced in having the mighty man to pet and honour, and make cosily comfortable&#x0201D; (Woolner 275).</note>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Several times I have heard of you from James Aitken and others, not always the best of news;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">James Aitken Jr. wrote, <date when="1867-01-25">25 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;I had a note from Mr Neuberg this morning&#x02014; Last time I saw him I offered him the stray dog w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> followed me home but he writes to say his sister has vetoed its coming &#x02003; he does not want to revolt against the female authority of the house! / The sudden breaking up of the frost had made him very ill but though still confined to the house he is much better &#x02018;&#x02003; wishes to be kindly remembered to you.&#x02019;&#x0201D;</note>
 and if I have not written, it is not for want of kindly tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and remembrance, but because of my own sombre mood, fitter for silence than for speech with any of the living. I grieved to learn that you had been suffering, in those dark storms of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Englis<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Winter;&#x02014;tho&#x02019; still standing obstinately to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Work, and now a little improved ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> since the boisterous thaws have come. Perhaps y<hi rend="italic">r work</hi> is a benefit to you withal; but I cannot help wishing you had done with it:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Neuberg was working on his German trans. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>.</note>
 &#x02014;everything connected with that Book is more or less gloomy and miserable to me; the one recompense and consolat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> seems to be that one do get done with it for all time and all eternity! Ah me, ah me!&#x02014; In another winter, too, you might escape hither; and fairly have a quasi-summer instead; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> to you might be especially beneficial, as perhaps it is now in some less degree to myself. It is certain I had no belief in such a winter climate as this has proved to be; and for bright sun, and beauty of earth and sea and sky, we may challenge the whole world! I never saw such a feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi> even in my dreams; nor with eye and sense such weather as we now have, in any month of the year: This is something always,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; it is by no means all!&#x02014;</p>
<p>For sublimity, the picturesque &#x02003;c, &#x02003;c, I care less than most of my neighbours profess to do; indeed, except as <hi rend="italic">secondaries</hi>, may say I care nothing: nevertheless it is a fact, I seldom yet rush out on a morning after bathing with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> some sentiment of wonder and almost pleasure over those wild stony Peaks (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> girdle us all in from the North, and kindly press us upon the sea and the sunshine); they are wildest mount<hi rend="italic">n</hi> architecture; towering up, jagged, sharp and bare, steeper than church-spires (sometimes with a little <hi rend="italic">castle</hi> perched atop, strangely <hi rend="italic">near</hi> to you, tho&#x02019; 6 miles off by measure<hi rend="italic">t</hi>);<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">For the castle above Sainte-Agnes, see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670123-TC-CDB-01">

 &#x02014;they sit there grim &#x02003; cruel, like so many haggard old Witches of Endor holding conclave,&#x02014;stone-naked to the <hi rend="italic">waist</hi>; but after that, furnished with the beautifullest green ample <hi rend="italic">petticoats</hi> (all of terraced olive-woods and orange and lemon <pb id="pg-44-148" n="44:148"/>
<pb id="pg-44-149" n="44:149"/>woods); the strangest thing I ever looked at in the &#x0201C;scenery&#x0201D; kind. I wander much by the wild rocky paths in those entirely silent Olive woods; entirely solitary till the sun sink, and the poor peas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> people (most of them old women) with their asses &#x02003; packages shrink home, bidding me as they pass, &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Bon soir, M&#x02019;sieu</hi>!&#x0201D; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is nearly all the French the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> part of them have. &#x0201C;Camin<hi rend="italic">o</hi> [go on]!&#x0201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Presumably the donkey women&#x02019;s version of the Italian &#x0201C;cammina [go on]!&#x0201D;</note>
 I hear them say to their donkeys;&#x02014;the ass is most respectable here, indeed a fine loyal animal, and the staff of life to Mentone; at nightfall one meets on our main street endless rows of them filing home, loaded with miscellanies &#x02003; big and small packages, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I sometimes wish to break into, and take some inventory of! These native people seem to be the poorest and the frugallest, also the peaceablest, civillest &#x02003; probably happiest I have seen for a long time.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">Neuberg replied, <date when="1867-03-11">11 March</date>: &#x0201C;How much happier in your bright, sunny, peaceable Mentone, with its grand Nature, loyally patient population, and donkeys of a superior quality!&#x0201D; J. Henry Bennet wrote: &#x0201C;The able pedestrian may be said to command the entire Mentonian amphitheatre; but it is not so with the invalid, with ladies, children, and the weak generally. The ascents are often winding and steep, the roads mere broken tracks, and were it not for the donkeys, much of the most wild and picturesque scenery would be all but inaccessible to the invalid population. These animals are numerous, as every peasant, the owner of a few mountain terraces, keeps one as a beast of burden. Donkeys are as peculiarly suited to a rugged mountain district as the camel is to the desert. At Mentone they are mostly fine handsome animals, and more than usually docile and good-tempered; probably because they are treated with affection and kindness, instead of with contempt and brutality. The peasants always guide them by the voice, not by blows. &#x02026; The donkey women are only the owners of the saddles, hiring the donkeys from the peasants&#x0201D; (Bennet, <hi rend="italic">Winter in the South</hi> 164&#x02013;65).

<p>There are 5,000 natives in Mentone; perhaps 4,500 of them of this poor class; nobody very rich that I hear of, tho&#x02019; several now making money by the English;&#x02014;and the place all bursting out into Villas &#x02003;c &#x02003;c like a mushroom in a favb<hi rend="italic">le</hi> night.

<p>&#x02018;Inclination&#x02019; to write letters is a thing I have not traced in myself for many years back, and in these past months naturally less than ever!

<p>It must be said I am doing fairly rather well in these beautiful new localities;&#x02014;and have at least escaped a great deal of meteorological horrors, which you describe in such frightful colours.

I hope, however, there was an increase of admiration for the Solon-like Law of our Metropolis, which fines men when they <hi rend="italic">do</hi> fling out ashes before their door on such occasions, and try to <hi rend="italic">reduce</hi> the cipher of broken bones:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Solon (ca. 638&#x02013;ca. 558 BC), Athenian politician and poet, known for his humane laws; it was against London bylaws to throw ashes and other rubbish into the street, but most towns had bylaws allowing ashes to be spread in time of frost to help prevent accidents; in a letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1867-01-19">19 Jan.</date>, signed &#x0201C;CIVIL SERVANT,&#x0201D; the correspondent wrote: &#x0201C;If during this severe weather the heads of families would simply direct their servants to throw the ashes into the street, instead of into the ashpits, locomotion, both for men and animals, would be greatly facilitated, and horses drawing heavy loads would be eased of more than one-half their labour in the present state of the streets.&#x0201D;</note>&#x02014;in the universe we are surely an unrivalled people, for civic <pb id="pg-44-152" n="44:152"/>&#x0201C;commonsense,&#x0201D; above all things.&#x02014; Here at Mentone the Heavens, of their own accord, send a climate which, for the Spring and Winter months, I think must be the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> in the world: such a february, following such a january, I never dreamt of; nor indeed did I ever see such weather elsewhere as we now have, in any month of the year.

<salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>
<p>If the few bits of Letters I have written from this place had gone by the <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> priority and sequence, this w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been the first or among the very first;&#x02014;and indeed it is essentially so,&#x02014;the first that I have written except upon compulsion, or in answer to something written. My aversion to writing is at all times great. But I begin to feel a great want of having some news from you, at least of hearing that you are not fallen <hi rend="italic">unwell</hi>; and there is no other method of rousing you to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> duty.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Ruskin replied, <date when="1867-02-17">17 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;I should indeed have written to you, as you bade me&#x02014;long ago, if it had not been that I had nothing to say except &#x02026; what you knew very well&#x02014;(that I loved you&#x02014;and because I did, was glad, for the time, I had lost you).&#x0201D;</note>

</p>
<p>I have done passably well since getting out hither; and cannot but count it a kind of benefit that the impetuous Tyndall tore me out from the sleety mud-abysses of London, as if by the hair of the head; and dropped me here, on a shore where there is at least clean air to breathe, and a climate that is bright and cheerful to move about in,&#x02014;and where, if frost did fall, and the streets became all of glass, people w<hi rend="italic">d not</hi> be &#x0201C;fined for throwing ashes before their door,&#x0201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">See <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670210-TC-JAF-01">

 and trying to <hi rend="italic">save</hi> one&#x02019;s bones or brains from being broken if one ventured out!&#x02014; That is really hitherto the most unmanageable, or almost the one unmanageable point for me in the problem of my London Winter: compelled to take no exercise except under peril of life or limb;&#x02014;&#x0201C;most thinking people,&#x0201D; was there ever the match of you for a power of &#x0201C;common sense&#x0201D; especially!&#x02014;</p>
<p>I dare say you have been here; and descript<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of scenery, locality &#x02003;c w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be quite thrown away on you. From Antibes on the west to Bodighiera<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Antibes, town in France 33 mi. (53 km.) W of Menton; Bordighera, small town in Italy 15 mi. (24.5 km.) E of Menton.</note>
 on the east, a stretch of perhaps 40 miles diameter, is a beautiful semicircular <hi rend="italic">alcove</hi>, guarded by the Maritime Alps, from all bad winds; included in this <hi rend="italic">big</hi> bay (or <hi rend="italic">alcove</hi>) are five or six smaller ones,&#x02014;of wh<hi rend="italic">h Mentone</hi>, towards Bodighiera, is the last but one:&#x02014;no climate, you perceive, can have a better chance to be <hi rend="italic">good</hi>: and indeed, ever since Xmas last, when I arrived, it has far surpassed all my expectat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, or require<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> in that partic<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; rather <hi rend="italic">too</hi> hot, for most part, and <pb id="pg-44-155" n="44:155"/>driving me into the Olive-woods and shaggy ravines, if the Sun is still high. One&#x02019;s paths there are steep exceedingly and rough exceedingly (donkey-paths for the country people, paved into dreadful <hi rend="italic">stairs</hi> in the bad places); but they are silent, solitary; a walk there is soothing to one&#x02019;s sad tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>, instead of irritating, and does one good, tho&#x02019; of a mournful kind. As to &#x0201C;scenery,&#x0201D; you know me to care next to nothing for it; but I must own, these pinnacles that <hi rend="italic">stud</hi> the back of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> little Mentone &#x0201C;alcove,&#x0201D; for example, are the strangest and grandest things of the mountain kind I ever saw; bare-rocks, sharp as steeples, jagged as if hewn by lightning; most grim, perilous, cruel, &#x0201C;sitting there,&#x0201D; I sometimes say, &#x0201C;like so many witches of Endor, <hi rend="italic">naked</hi> to the waist, but therefrom with the amplest <hi rend="italic">petticoats</hi> of dark or bright green&#x0201D; (for all is terraced, and covered with Olives or oranges and lemons, down almost to the sea),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">For Menton from the west, see above; the groves going &#x0201C;almost to the sea&#x0201D; are in the foreground; Villa Madonna was in this part of new Menton and was possibly one of the buildings among the trees that can be seen.</note>
 &#x02014;a really fine scene, especially at morning &#x02003; ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> in light &#x02003; shade, under a sky so clear &#x02003; pure; scene wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I never yet raise my eyes to with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> something of surprise and recognit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.</p>

<p>The worst of my existence here is that I am thoroughly idle,&#x02014;for the &#x0201C;work&#x0201D; I try at intervals is a mockery of work;&#x02014;and my real task is to walk ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 4 or 5 miles every day, and to guard myself vigilantly from being bored by <pb id="pg-44-156" n="44:156"/>surrounding blockheads. For we are ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 800 here, and none of us has really anything to do. Patience, vigilance,&#x02014;and shirk off into the Olive woods!</p>
<p>Often I begin to think of my route home ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; &#x02003; what I shall next do then. Alas, all is abstruse and gloomy on that latter head; but surely something sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and must be settled as to all that too: while the days are, and any remnant of strength is, one ought not to wander in mere sadness of soul, doing nothing! The only point I look forward to with any fixed satisfact<hi rend="italic">n</hi> as yet, is that of having Ruskin ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> every Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, and tasting a little human conversat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> once in the week, if oftener be not practicable!&#x02014; But the very time of my returning is uncert<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; tho&#x02019; I care not for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> March tempests, and perhaps had better be at Chelsea even now: but there are grand speculat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> seeing Rome first, Genoa at least and Florence first,&#x02014;and many attempts to awaken my appetite that way, hitherto with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> success perceptible.

That satiety of travel is surely a kind of lichenous overgrowing of one&#x02019;s thoughts when one has been <hi rend="italic">too</hi> long at rest&#x02014;very good for most people &#x02026; but surely not for you?

<p>Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> news is all satisfactory; especially Alick&#x02019;s Letter is welcome: I never till now c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> clearly be sure that he had got that <hi rend="italic">money</hi>;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC had sent &#x000A3;100 to John A.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Some days ago I heard from Maggie Welsh that poor Grace, at Craigenvilla, was gone;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Maggie Welsh wrote, <date when="1867-02-16">16 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;I grieve to have the most sad news of poor Grace Welsh to send you. <hi rend="italic">This very morning</hi> I had written a letter to you to tell you of Walter&#x02019;s visit to Craigen Villa, &#x02003; the letter is lying beside me now sad &#x02003; in vain! Walter came in only half an hour ago to tell me that all our hopes &#x02003; fears about poor Grace are of avail no longer! There is a notice of her death in the newspaper today; she died yesterday. It will be a sad blow to her sisters, poor old ladies. Of late I do think they have hoped Grace might have been spared to them, though of course they could not but face how precarious her state had for long been. So lately as Monday when Walter was there, poor Ann spoke cheerfully &#x02003; even hopefully, &#x02003; now! &#x02026; I know <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will feel it much for the sake of <hi rend="italic">Her</hi> we all loved so dearly.&#x0201D; Walter Welsh also wrote, <date when="1867-02-16">16 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;Maggie tells me she is sending you a few lines, &#x02003; much grieved you will be to hear of poor Grace Welsh&#x02019;s death which took place yesterday. Perhaps rather one should think it well that she is released from the state of weakness &#x02003; suffering to which she was reduced, &#x02003; from which she herself looked for no recovery. She has borne all calmly &#x02003; peacefully throughout her long illness.&#x0201D; TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1867-02-20">20 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;News this morning that poor Grace Welsh, my Jeannie&#x02019;s youngest Aunt, is dead,&#x02014;Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>

We had an hour or two at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; &#x02003; John and I drove out to the poor old Aunts. Their grief was genuine; tho&#x02019; to mine it was like a pail of water to the sea. Poor Grace was the first of them I saw; nobody c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> then have tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the first of us to pass away. She was not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> fine qualities; my Darling, tho&#x02019; not blind to her bits of affectatn<hi rend="italic">s</hi> &#x02003;c, always liked her,&#x02014;and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> often repeat to me old faithful Betty acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of their exorbitant profession of &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">religion</hi>,&#x02019; as they heartily endeavoured to think it: &#x0201C;Oh my dear, they <hi rend="italic">might</hi> ha&#x02019; ta&#x02019;en to waur!&#x02019;&#x02014; She came to see us at Humbie (Fife year), Ann &#x02003; she both came; and were very affectionate and good: that was the last time I ever saw my Darling &#x02003; any of them together. They had built a pretty little cottage at Morningside; called it &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">Craigenvilla</hi>&#x02019;; there will now be only two of them instead of 3,&#x02014;sad, sad to think of for the good old souls.

See also TC to MW, <date when="1867-01-26">26 Jan.</date> JWC and TC stayed at Humbie, Fife, <date when="1867-06-28">28 June</date> to <date when="1859-08-05">5 Aug. 1859</date>; neither noted any visit of Ann and Grace Welsh in this time (see vol. 35).</note>
 and yesterday, thro&#x02019; James, I had what the Dr had heard, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was not then new to me. I am very sad and wae to think of it all; and feel well how desolate the Two Sisters will be in the old house wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> lately belonged to Three! The <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of all things comes; and it is sad and solemn to all thinking and loving Souls. The last time I saw poor Grace was on that saddest day of my life, when I had buried all that was most precious to me in the world:&#x02014;Grace was then the youngest of the whole party, and one c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> little have expected that she<pb id="pg-44-161" n="44:161"/>was to be the first of us that sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be called away.

Want is want, from whatever cause it spring!&#x02014; The weather here continues almost too magnificent; this morning, on the &#x0201C;Promenades&#x0201D; N. &#x02003; South by the sea-shore, (<hi rend="italic">south</hi>w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of the street and its edifices) the English people were seated with umbrellas above them, reading the Newspapers: a sun like july, in a sky clear as diamonds, with the mount<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> seeming within arm&#x02019;s-length, tho&#x02019; the farthest peaks are perhaps 10 miles away. Sunday gone a fortnight, the day before I last wrote to the Dr, gave us, on the other hand, 18 or 20 hours of such rain as I never saw: windless, straight-down, in continual streams &#x02003; torrents;&#x02014;for the first time in 30 years, I did not get out, the whole day; but had to content myself with an hour<pb id="pg-44-162" n="44:162"/>of <hi rend="italic">quarter-deck</hi>-ing within doors instead. But for this I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have called the rain also glorious,&#x02014;one day of it at least, among many sunny; tho&#x02019; otherwise it might have grown ugly enough.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I sent you on three big Photographs of Mentone; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I hope may afford you and Jean some entertain<hi rend="italic">t</hi> when they come; and elucidate, as if to the very eye, some partic<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> of my situat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> here.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">See the photograph of the area, <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670226-TC-NPWM-01">W of Old Menton with TC&#x02019;s notes</ref><sic>see 165</sic>; for photographs 2 and 3, see vol. 45; see also <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670226-TC-NPOM-01">TC&#x02019;s note on the photograph of Old Menton</ref><sic>, see 69</sic>.</note> They are directed to Dumfries as usual; but I am not quite <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> you are there. If you did go to attend the last duties to poor Grace Welsh in this world, it will be a consolatory tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me, amid the many, many sad ones ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that event, and the <hi rend="italic">reminiscences</hi> it awakens into new vivacity, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> were by no means <hi rend="italic">asleep</hi>! Say to Ann and Eliz<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, if you have opportunity, all that is kind and tender on this mournful event; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will have left a most sad blank in their loving little circle. Ah me, ah me!&#x02014; If you are with Erskine, too, I shall be well pleased.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1867-02-25">25 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;I was invited to the funeral &#x02003; would have gone, but there was no vacancy for me in my old lodging, &#x02003; I did not feel well enough to go &#x02003; stay in any inn. I &#x02026; may go into Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> for some days &#x02026; &#x02003; then I will call &#x02003; see Miss Welsh &#x02003; Miss Anne, &#x02003; also Mr Erskine, &#x02003; tell you about them all. I am almost as thin-skinned in regard to strange beds as you yourself are, &#x02003; I really could not safely go to the funeral.&#x0201D;</note>
 His case is too like my own to need vocal assurances of my sympathy: alas, as if <hi rend="italic">these</hi>, at any rates c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> profit one sensibly, in one&#x02019;s woe!&#x02014;</p>
<p>All is getting unfastened here,&#x02014;for <hi rend="italic">departure</hi> somewhither, Poor L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Brownlow&#x02019;s long <hi rend="italic">worn</hi> thread of life <hi rend="italic">snapped</hi> in the gentlest unexpected manner yesterday gone a week; and he suddenly passed away, and was gone like a dream. The Household there is shut accordingly (nothing left but some servants packing it together); the rest are all off to England,&#x02014;to the funeral (in Lincolnshire) and what will follow. This has quite extinguished any chance there was in Mentone for Lady An, who used to be there <hi rend="italic">daily</hi> and almost hourly;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lady Alford and her sons had been staying at La Grande Bretagne hotel; see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670320-TC-MBO-01"><corr>TC to MBO, <date when="1867-03-20">20 March</date></corr></ref>. But TC implied in his <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670226-TC-NPOM-01">note to the photograph of Old Menton</ref><sic>(see 169)</sic> that she and her sons were staying in Villa Usborne in the hills above Old Menton. Presumably they had the use of the villa but were mainly in the hotel.</note> and indeed had nobody she specially cared for except &#x0201C;Lady Marian,&#x0201D; that now bereaved Mother. The result is, Lady A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is more eager than ever to be off for the Italian Expedit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, or for <hi rend="italic">something</hi> or <hi rend="italic">other</hi>,&#x02014;c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> she but get the many <hi rend="italic">lines</hi> of her complex affairs to <hi rend="italic">intersect</hi> handsomely: wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she cannot!<pb id="pg-44-171" n="44:171"/>Her situat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> here is really intricate; and she makes it, by her impetuous handling, often enough not <hi rend="italic">less</hi> but so more so. For me, I think I have ab<hi rend="italic">t renounced</hi> the not<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of &#x0201C;accompanying&#x0201D;; nay, seeing my situat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, weak health and gloom of mind, she herself I think has renounced me. And then her own plans, alas they are manifold, and hardly anything stands <hi rend="italic">firm</hi> hitherto!</p>
<p>This very morning I was speaking to her ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> your &#x0201C;meeting&#x0201D; me somewhere (for as to needing to be <hi rend="italic">fetched</hi> home, I profess to scorn it), and ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a quest<hi rend="italic">n</hi> I had raised with myself whether &#x0201C;a month of Vichy&#x0201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Vichy, spa town, the Auvergne, central France, known for its healing mineral waters; Lady Ashburton had been there the previous summer; see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18660721-TC-LLA-01"><corr>TC to LLA, <date when="1866-07-21">21 July 1866</date>

What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to hinder him?&#x0201D;&#x02014;and seemed delighted with the pretty dream. Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I naturally left standing there on its own feet, what feet <hi rend="italic">it</hi> had.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1867-03-05">5 March</date>: &#x0201C;As to Vichy, I think the waters there, as in many other similar places, would not do at all, unless in summer or autumn, when all external relations are different from what they are in spring&#x02014;such as temperature, action of the skin &#x02003;c. I don&#x02019;t think such waters are ever used in winter or spring, but I am sadly rusted in that &#x02003; many other medical matters. &#x02026; Possibly we might go together in summer, &#x02003; give them a fair trial in the proper season! The distance is not very great, &#x02003; there must be quiet lodgings in such a place. &#x02026; I feel rather shaky &#x02003; sensitive myself at present, &#x02003; have no experience of railway travelling in France, otherwise I might have started at once to assist you without farther discussion.&#x0201D; He wrote again, <date when="1867-03-06">6 March</date>: &#x0201C;now I feel that I ought to have said expressly that I shall be ready to meet you at any place you choose to name on the way home from Mentone, &#x02003; do the best I can to assist you on the journey. I dont feel very well at present, but it seems to me that the travelling might do me good rather than otherwise, as the main part of my ailments probably arise from the tendency to stagnation which is unavoidable at Dumfries.&#x0201D;</note> In short she is the most generous-hearted, but the most tumble-headed (not that she wants sense either, far from that) of existing Hostesses;&#x02014;and it appears to me, I ought to lift anchor before long, as the handsomest method, and reappear in Chelsea <hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi> [one way or another]. Not to say that the Sun has absolutely got <hi rend="italic">too hot</hi> for me here; and that (partly as a consequence) I have taken <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>, on the small scale hitherto, but any scale is too <hi rend="italic">big</hi>. I am very lazy, too, and very idle; more <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> (intrinsically) no human soul can be. It seems to me, March in Chelsea may be ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> as tolerable as March <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.&#x02014;&#x02014; Write to me; James will forward this to where you are.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> long &#x02003; welcome Letter, &#x02003; since that Jean&#x02019;s: I am ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> writing <hi rend="italic">shortly</hi> today; and as it is on a kind of conclusive bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi>, I will study to stick by the practical points. Let me first say, however, that the <hi rend="italic">Photographs</hi> are still <hi rend="italic">here</hi>; after lying 2 days in the Post-Office, they were <hi rend="italic">sent back</hi> (<hi rend="italic">stamps</hi> unhurt), the Officials objecting to my <hi rend="italic">marginalia</hi> of exposit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> as illegal. Good, good. A hasty English<hi rend="italic">n</hi> setting out on Tuesday has undertaken to convey them to Rood Lane, where they will come to you, I hope, by surer &#x02003; better courses. I am writing to James also today; and send this note to be forwarded by him.</p>
<p>So far as I can judge the Roman expedit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is now given up by Lady A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> herself; and it is uncert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> whether either she or I shall so much as &#x0201C;see Genoa,&#x0201D; tho&#x02019; it might so easily be done.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lord Northbrook wrote from Nice, <date when="1867-03-02">2 March</date>: &#x0201C;I have tried to find someone going home with whom you would like to travel, but everybody is now going to Florence &#x02003; Rome &#x02003; not to England. Lady Ashburton &#x02026; told my wife that you think of going to Genoa with her &#x02026; &#x02003; in that case I suppose you will not want anyone to join you from here.&#x0201D;</note>
 But my <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> still continues (threatening to root itself in the larynx, and be hanged to it!) and the &#x0201C;sight&#x0201D; of anything is become worth extremely little to me. Not to say that a fierce east-wind is blowing, almost equal to an English d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, sometimes <hi rend="italic">grey</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I like better, not improved at all to one&#x02019;s feelings by the blazing of a sun, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is only like roasting you and icing you both in one. March comes in like a lion here too, it seems; these last 4 days are far the worst, and properly the first disagreeable ones, we have yet had.</p>
<p>To cut matters short I intend to be off towards Chelsea in ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 8 days (March 12 or so); and expect to be in my own house (<hi rend="italic">home</hi>, alas, I can call it no longer) before next week quite end. The Butler of the late L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Brownlow people is ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> setting out on that day (will &#x0201C;stay to <hi rend="italic">any</hi> day,&#x0201D; &#x0201C;do any &#x02003;c &#x02003;c for me[&#x0201D;]; he is one of the most perfect-looking, wise, quiet and obliging persons of his stat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, this Butler &#x0201C;Tweedie,&#x0201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Mr. Tweedie not further identified; John A.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> welcome Letter of March 5 arrived yesterday morning; and set me thinking while I was at breakfast in my fantastic &#x0201C;Pavillon&#x0201D; here, that you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in George Street,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A. Carlyle lodged at 73 George St. when in Edinburgh.</note> also making y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> solitary breakfast,&#x02014;in circ<hi rend="italic">s</hi> fatally changed for one of us since we last sat there together! This morning a second Lr or Postscript to the former, brief and kind, informing me that y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> purpose still held; and farther that you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come and meet me cheerfully at any point of my route home. Thanks, thanks; but that will not be necessary, I hope. Since the last of these two Letters from you, I think you must have rec<hi rend="italic">d my</hi> latest; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was to the effect that I purposed to be home, <hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi> [one way or the other], on resources extant here, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of this week now begun; and that it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be gratifying to me if I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> find you at Chelsea, on visit to me for a month. Yesterday, finding you were gone to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I meant to write but was prevented, and today do write, That you were not to lame or curtail y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> visit on my acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi>; but to do all y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> purposes there, and aft<hi rend="italic">ds</hi> come to me so soon as it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be really agreeable to you.

Caroline Fox noted about her visit, <date when="1867-03-05">5 March</date>, that they were called to see Lady Ashburton before she left: &#x0201C;[TC] spoke of the beauty of this country, and specially of the view from the bridge, which he must have crossed seventy times, and the pleasure of the warmth and the sunshine with the clear blue sky above one, rather than the cold and wet and mud of London. Then he took us to Lady Ashburton, whose carriage was getting ready, and we took leave of him. &#x02026; She encouraged our coming again to see Carlyle, thinking it quite a kindness to stir him up. She was glad he had spoken of anything with pleasure, &#x02018;for,&#x02019; she added, &#x02018;I&#x02019;m very fond of the old man, and I did what I thought was for the best, and I really hope he is the better for it in spite of himself, though sometimes it seems as if it was altogether a failure&#x0201D; (Fox, <hi rend="italic">Memories of Old Friends</hi> [<date when="1882">1882</date>] 340&#x02013;41).

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>By y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> three Letters wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> came in success<hi rend="italic">n</hi> from Dumfries, I infer that you got to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last week<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A. Carlyle wrote from Edinburgh, <date when="1867-03-11">11 March</date>: &#x0201C;The Miss Welshes I saw on Saturday evening &#x02003; had tea with them. Mr Erskine I have also seen at great length, &#x02003; am to dine alone with him tonight. He looks composed &#x02003; as well as usual, but has less strength for walking.&#x0201D; On <date when="1867-03-13">13 March</date>, he reported: &#x0201C;I have seen the Miss Welshes today. They look more quiet &#x02003; cheerful. I gave them a copy of the Inscription at Haddington w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I got on the Monday before writing to you my first Poste Restante, Paris. I have seen much of Erskine &#x02003; dine alone with him this evening.&#x0201D;</note>
 (whither accordingly I wrote 3 days ago); &#x02003; that <pb id="pg-44-177" n="44:177"/>probably, the day after tomorrow, you will make for Chelsea, arrive there that night; and be found there, a rather wearied on Saturday morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, when this reaches you. So far all will be well on that side!&#x02014;</p>
<p>My purpose stands to bend for home immediately, in fact to start by the Express from Nice tomorrow at 3.20 p.m.;&#x02014;but for the rest, everything round me is fallen into inextricable jumble; chiefly by waiting for that &#x0201C;Dr Frank,&#x0201D; who did arrive in Town last night, but in spite of repeated messages has never shown face here yet, but keeps me waiting till the Post-hour is in danger of passing;&#x02014;and who indeed I begin to suspect has nothing comfortable to tell me; his Butler Tweeding with luggage and serving-maid arrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> being probably <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to go by trains and methods wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> never suit me! Foolish fellow, I am perfectly ready for that form of the adventure, and can go perfectly on my own footing, since need is: him I merely wanted to ask a few quest<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> H&#x000F4;tels in Paris &#x02003;c, and to take honb<hi rend="italic">le</hi> leave of [indecipherable symbol].<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">&#x0201C;Tweeding&#x0201D;: Mr. Tweedie; TC&#x02019;s symbol may be to indicate Dr. Frank.</note>&#x02014; &#x02014; Pooh, pooh, pooh! Here at this point is Frank in person, as large as life; and tells me that &#x0201C;Tweedie&#x0201D; is <hi rend="italic">discharged</hi> of his maids &#x02003; burdens; and is ready and eager, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> Tweedie <hi rend="italic">solus</hi> [only], to take charge of me, and carry me triumphantly thro&#x02019;, in what manner <hi rend="italic">I</hi> like! One of the best &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">couriers</hi>&#x0201D; too, Frank tells me; and a thoroughly safe, obed<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, punctual &#x02003; respectable man. Very well, very well; much better than the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> way!</p>
<p>We drive off to Nice, then, in Lady An&#x02019;s carriage, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is at Command; T. and I are there, and start in the <hi rend="italic">express</hi>, tomorrow thursday a<supplied>[t]</supplied> 3.20 p.m.&#x02014; Stop that night at Avignon 12.47 (<hi rend="italic">a.m.</hi>, i.e. n<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1 a.m, hotel said to be good); see Avignon: leave, so far as I can make out ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 2 p.m (of Friday), are at Lyon ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 7 p.m.,&#x02014;and in 12 hours more (if we choose to make no farther stops) are at Paris, 6.55 Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> morning; can go on in ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> an hour (i.e. I can, tho Tw<hi rend="italic">e</hi> has to stay a day there), but will probably stop till night at least,&#x02014;&#x02003; not arrive till Sunday by one of the two Boulogne trains.

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>I know not in what part of the Earth you are wandering, probably at Rome on sunny heights, with &#x0201C;fine street architecture&#x0201D; and the other accompaniments, of fine weather and locality; but as for me, it is cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> I arrived here, safe and thankful, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> six &#x02003; 30 hours ago,&#x02014;viz. a little after midnight on Saturday 16th;&#x02014;and am lying here perdu [concealed] ever since to rest myself a little, and doing better than c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been expected. Under the excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> couriership of Tweedie, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> indeed was perfect<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in that kind, I suffered a strict minimum of misery; and even had some noticeable bits of enjoym<hi rend="italic">t</hi> by the road.

Mary Boyle wrote about meeting TC in Menton: &#x0201C;It was on the death of his wife that Carlyle&#x02019;s attached friend, Louisa, Lady Ashburton, knowing the state of grief into which he was plunged by the sudden blow, persuaded him to come out to Mentone to pass some weeks with her in a charming villa not far from the hotel, La Grand Bretagne, where I was staying with Lady Marian Alford, and her son, the late Lord Brownlow. During the early part of the winter there had been daily intercourse between the Villa and the Hotel, and Lady Ashburton, anxious to distract the mourner&#x02019;s mind, and give a new turn to his thoughts, induced him with herself to become a constant associate in our walks and drives, and to dine and pass the evening very frequently at the Hotel, and while away the hours in delightful conversation with the mother and son to whom I have before alluded.&#x0201D; TC reminded Mary Boyle, &#x0201C;in one respect, and one alone,&#x0201D; of Walter Savage Landor, &#x0201C;and that was the violent invectives in which he not infrequently indulged against persons, places, and opinions. &#x02026; Carlyle would launch forth into the most unwarrantable philippics, but then he would break off suddenly, and all the venom and bitterness be drowned in a burst of ringing laughter, and his handsome, though naturally grim, face would ripple all over with good-humoured smiles&#x0201D;; she thought TC&#x02019;s words reported in print were misleading as they failed to show the laughter that accompanied them in spoken form (<hi rend="italic">Mary Boyle, Her Book</hi>, ed.

<salute>Dear Miss Boyle,</salute>
<p>Under guidance of the excellent Tweedie, I was safely landed here, shortly after midnight of Saturday last.

Alas! What can writing do in such a case? The inexorable stroke has fallen; the sore heart has to carry on its own unfathomable <pb id="pg-44-185" n="44:185"/>dialogue with the Eternities and their gloomy Fact; all speech in it, from the friendliest sympathiser, is apt to be vain, or worse. Under your quiet words in that little note, there is legible to me a depth of violent grief and bereavement, which seems to enjoin silence rather. We knew the beautiful soul that has departed, the love that had united you and Her from the beginnings of existence,&#x02014;and how desolate and sad the scene now is for him who is left solitary. Ah me! ah me!</p>
<p>Yesterday gone a twelvemonth (<date when="1867-03-31">31 March 1867</date>, <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> by the day of the week) was the day I arrived at your door in Edinburgh, and was met by that friendliest of Hostesses<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC stayed with Thomas Erskine in Edinburgh, <date when="1867-03-31">31 March</date>&#x02013;<date when="1867-04-07">7 April 1867</date>, when he went to deliver his rectorial address; Erskine&#x02019;s sister Christian Stirling acted as hostess during that visit; see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660330-TC-JAC-01"><sic>43:153&#x02013;54</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1866-03-30">30 March 1866</date></corr></ref>. David Paterson had long been an invalid and was living at 8 Newbattle Terr., Morningside, Edinburgh, with her son, James Erskine Paterson, and his family: &#x0201C;Broken health, requiring change of climate, and family ties requiring separate residence, had hindered her from being so much with her brother as her elder sister&#x0201D; (Hanna, <hi rend="italic">Letters of Thomas Erskine of Linlathen</hi> 2:301).</note>
 and you; three days before, I had left at the door of this room one dearer and kinder than all the earth to me, whom I was not to behold again: what a change for you since then, what a change for me! Change <hi rend="italic">after</hi> change following upon both of us,&#x02014;upon you especially!</p>
<p>It is the saddest feature of old age, that the old man has to see himself daily grow more lonely; reduced to commune with the inarticulate Eternities, and the Loved Ones now unresponsive who have preceded him thither. Well, well; there is a blessedness in this too, if we take it well. There is a grandeur in it, if also an <hi rend="italic">extent</hi> of sombre sadness, which is new to one; nor is hope quite wanting,&#x02014;nor the clear conviction that those whom <hi rend="italic">we</hi> would most screen from sore pain and misery are now safe and at rest. It lifts one to real kingship withal, <hi rend="italic">real</hi> for the first time in this scene of things. Courage, my friend; let us endure patiently and act piously to the end.</p>
<p>Shakespeare sings pathetically somewhere:&#x02014;</p>

<p>&#x02014;inexpugnable and well art <hi rend="italic">thou</hi>! These tones go tinkling through me sometimes, like the pious chime of far-off church bells.</p>
<p>Adieu, my friend.

Text from Wilson as he included the final sentence. Neuberg died during the night of <date when="1867-03-22">22 March</date>. TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1867-04-03">3 April</date>: &#x0201C;Yesterday gone a week (Tuesday <date when="1867-03-26">26 March</date>, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 5 p.m., John and I just sitting down to dinner), Painter <hi rend="italic">Tait</hi> surprised us by a visit, to comunicate very sad tidings,&#x02014;that poor Neuberg, whom I had not yet gone to see, and did not know to be in the least seriously ill, was suddenly no more! Had died ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> midnight of the Friday before (<date when="1867-03-22">22 March 1867</date>), and was to be buried on the morrow. The news fell on me like a heavy dull weight, not like a pungently sharp stroke; and so hangs ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me ever since. We took what steps were possible (<hi rend="italic">now</hi> so insignif<hi rend="italic">t</hi>!)&#x02014;despatched a fit person to take plaster-cast of the dead face (his poor Sister having signified some wish of the kind); went, all three, to the Funeral next day (poor Sister passionately welcoming us), &#x02003;c &#x02003;c,&#x02014;and, this day week, returned home, with the dreary feeling that our poor Neuberg lay in Highgate Cemetery, and that our eyes sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> never behold him more.&#x02014; For the last 20 or 25 years, he had been my most attached adherent, ever-loyal, ever patient, ardent, ever-willing to do me service in every kind:&#x02014;we were twice in Germany together, where I defined him to be &#x02018;worth 10 Couriers&#x02019;; in regard to the Book <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi> (especially till he took to translating it, and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had not the face to apply so often) his help was truly valuable (or <hi rend="italic">in</hi>valuable; sat 3 months in the State-Paper Office, for example, excerpting there, with a skill and rapid felicity not to be rivalled); he did all kinds of <hi rend="italic">excerpting</hi> and <hi rend="italic">abstracting</hi> &#x02003;c &#x02003;c as if I myself had done it;&#x02014;and, in brief, was an <hi rend="italic">alter-ego</hi> in all the deeper parts of that horrible immensity of drudgery w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I believe w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been impossible to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> him. Got not shanow of <hi rend="italic">reward</hi>, nor sought any; stood all my spurts of ill temper &#x02003;c, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> once wincing; worked like a patient hero for me, as if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had been nothing, I something, and as if it ennobled <hi rend="italic">his</hi> poor existence so to do! Perhaps no man of my day had such a <hi rend="italic">servant</hi> and <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> (in the noblest sense of these words),&#x02014;acquired to me with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the least effort too; rather permitted to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> himself, than in any way asked for. All this is now lost (a very small care to me that); but all this comes back to my memory in a diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> aspect now, and surely ought to continue there. Immense masses, containing huddled wrecks of his old work on <hi rend="italic">Fried</hi>h &#x02003;c, were just being put away (under wrappage in Garret <hi rend="italic">Press</hi>), &#x02003; the task just in the act of closing when this sad news came to me. I had written to him from Mentone; and a very pretty Letter of his followed me <hi rend="italic">thence</hi> the day after I got home. Must be in my <hi rend="italic">last</hi> bundle of Letters also upstairs (I suppose). His Letters were always pretty and attractive,&#x02014;much beyond his talk, tho&#x02019; that too was replete with sense and informat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x02014;always the talk of an enlightened, honest &#x02003; superior kind of man, tho&#x02019; with clumsy manners; Neuberg&#x02019;s age was only 61;&#x02014;I judged that it had been at least 6 years nearer my own. He was a strong-built middle-sized man, capable of great fatigue, and full of rugged energy and healthy vitality; but I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> notice that within the last few years, he had more frequent fits of liver &#x02003;c; was occasionally <hi rend="italic">deaf</hi> more or less; &#x02003; seemed to be breaking down: but it never once entered my tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that he c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> precede <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in the way we all have to go. He had not finished his Translat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Fr</hi>h; 1&#x000BD; voll. of it, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think, still to do:&#x02014;a task he infinitely liked, and took far <hi rend="italic">too much pains ab</hi>t; as I often seriously told him with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> producing any impress<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. He was rich, rather than otherwise, &#x02018;good buss<hi rend="italic">s</hi> in the City&#x02019; (managed by a Nephew, whom he <hi rend="italic">visited</hi> twice a week); his Sister Rosetta, and her two young children, will be perfectly at their ease in money matters, it appears. / Neuberg was a native of Hedingfeld n<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Wurzburg, by birth a <hi rend="italic">Jew</hi>, and indeed by aspect and character: a blond, thickset heavy kind of figure, features not acquiline but coarsely blunt with a tendency to plumpness, and on the face rather a defect of hair. Jew of the <hi rend="italic">better</hi> type or almost of the best: a man of perfect integrity, of serious reflective temper, of fine &#x02003; strong faculties (able to <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> anything presented to him), &#x02003; of many high aspiratn<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I never questioned him ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> his history; partly out of delicacy, tho&#x02019; I saw he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have told me. &#x02026; / Poor good Neuberg; far better to me than I ever owned him as being!&#x02014; Alas, it is not yet a year (tho&#x02019; near it now) since he was trying (not very acceptably or successfully) to sympathize with me and my great Sorrow;&#x02014;and now he is himself gone from this world.

<p>If the bust give you any satisfaction, surely I shall think it, all my days, well <pb id="pg-44-188" n="44:188"/>worth while.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC had a bust of Neuberg made from the plaster cast, which he gave to Rosetta Frankau. He himself kept a photograph of Neuberg in his dressing room (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x02019;s House</hi> 108). Wilson wrote that TC&#x02019;s letter also contained an agreement to Rosetta Frankau&#x02019;s suggestion that Friedrich Althaus be the man to complete the translation of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> that Neuberg had left unfinished (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 6:126); it presumably came first in the letter.</note>
 No kinder Friend had I in this world; no man of my day, I believe, had so faithful, loyal, and willing a Helper, as He generously was to me for the last 20 or more years. To look for his like again would be very vain indeed, were I even at the beginning of my course, instead of at the end! A man of fine faculty, too;&#x02014;decidedly the most intelligent, swift, and skilful, at that <pb id="pg-44-189" n="44:189"/>kind of work, whom I have ever seen or known of. The memory of him will remain dear and noble to me;&#x02014;the sudden stroke that has cut away such a Friend, in these my otherwise desolate days, may well be sad and heavy to me. But if so to me, what then is it to you and your dear little ones?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Rosetta Frankau was a widow with two young children; Neuberg had assumed responsibility for them after the death of her husband, Adolf Frankau (<date when="1820">1820</date>&#x02013;<date when="1856">56</date>), <date when="1856-10">Oct. 1856</date>.</note>
 Alas on this head I must <hi rend="italic">say</hi> nothing. I will bid you be of courage, of pious <hi rend="italic">courage</hi>, and in all things try and do as He would have ordered and wished, which I believe will daily be your best consolation in this sore trial. &#x02026;</p>
<p>My brother and I mean to venture up to see you before many days.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Wilson wrote that TC and John A. Carlyle called on Rosetta Frankau, <date when="1867-04-29">29 April</date>. She gave TC the pipe that Neuberg had made for him for his travels, but had been unable to give him before he left because of fog; it was a meerschaum pipe with a jointed stem that could easily be packed or carried in a pocket.</note>

<p>I ought to have written sooner; and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have done so perhaps, had there been a definite <hi rend="italic">address</hi>; but you were to &#x0201C;leave Mentone on the 11th,&#x0201D; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was within 3 days, and after that there was nothing but &#x0201C;Nice&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;Switzerland&#x0201D; of specified locality.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lady Ashburton wrote from Menton, 6 [5] April: &#x0201C;We leave this on 11<hi rend="italic">th</hi> &#x02003; go to Nice for a few days, &#x02003; then on to Switzerland.&#x0201D;</note>
 Truly I might have known that anything sent to Mentone w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> in all likelihood follow you;&#x02014;and I am not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> blame, but beg y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> forgivenness as a sinful man. A sinful, and a heavy-laden just now!</p>
<p>The truth is, my own life has been utterly inarticulate all this while; sunk in sorrowful reflexions and confusions, little prone to speak themselves, and indeed fitter for silence than for any utterance of them possible to me. These days are the anniversary of my Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> ones last year.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC left London, <date when="1867-03-28">28 March 1867</date>, traveling first to the home in Fryston of Lord Houghton (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x02013;<date when="1885">85</date>; <ref target="volume-44/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18794">

 By the day of the week, this <hi rend="italic">saturday</hi>; by the day of the month, tomorrow (Easter Sunday), ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 3 p.m., there happened&#x02014;I need not tell you what;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">JWC&#x02019;s death, <date when="1867-04-21">21 April</date>, the news of which TC received in Scotsbrig.</note>
 nor how the memory of it must forever dwell with me; with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> for all manner of reasons, best <hi rend="italic">speakable</hi> to my own heart alone.&#x02014; The death of poor Neuberg<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lady Ashburton wrote, <date when="1867-04-17">17 April</date>, also from Menton: &#x0201C;I cannot hear of the death of your old friend Neuberg without writing you a few words of afft<hi rend="italic">e</hi> sympathy.&#x0201D;</note>
 came upon me like a dull <pb id="pg-44-190" n="44:190"/>heavy weight; as a kind of <hi rend="italic">corollary</hi> to that <hi rend="italic">other</hi>, but with nothing of its poignancy; a dull broad blow following a stab into the heart; &#x02003; so remains with me. Did you hear of poor Erskine&#x02019;s new loss? His other Sister, Mrs Paterson; his Note upon it to us was very sad, very brief and quiet, good old man. He says to me, &#x0201C;the utter <hi rend="italic">separat</hi>n made by death is <hi rend="italic">wonderful</hi>&#x0201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">Erskine wrote, <date when="1867-04-05">5 April</date>: &#x0201C;The complete separation which death makes, is indeed wonderful&#x02014;we must walk by faith &#x02003; hope&#x02014;or else lie down &#x02003; die.&#x0201D; Lady Ashburton replied, <date when="1867-04-26">26 April</date>: &#x0201C;How much I feel for that dear old M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Erskine!&#x02014;but he will soon follow those he loved so well&#x02014;his life now must be desolation&#x02014;for the young people can in no wise supply their place in his heart&#x02014;or life&#x02014;&#x02003; how, my dear friend, I feel for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x02014;knowing as I do the wound that is always bleeding. Time does not cure such wounds&#x02014;only makes them deeper, I think&#x02014;most thankfully shall I devote my life to being of any use to you I can&#x02014;&#x02003; I am so grateful to you for allowing me to try&#x02014; I often think I did not make half enough of you while I had you at Mentone.&#x0201D;</note>
 and surely so it is, the palpablest and sorest miracle in this our miraculous existence!&#x02014; &#x02014; You comprehend that I have called on pretty nearly nobody; admitted few to see me; and feel, in general, least unhappy when left to silence, having as it were no interest whatever in the babbles and the nonsenses, &#x0201C;Reform Bills&#x0201D; &#x02003;c &#x02003;c, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> occupy all my neighbours, for the time being.</p>

I have never inquired what it was: but have this one point of comfort that Dizzy carries it; that the wretched persons who sold their Country (and gradually got it launched on this insane course) for a mess of Official pottage, are not to have the pottage after all, but that a dextrous Jew snaps it up from under their noses!&#x02014; Enough of all that.</p>

 reinforced by such domestic treatments as I have known,&#x02014;is a signal proof to me not only of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> boundless hospitality and kindness of heart towards friends, but also of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> sanguine temper, always flying off into perfect <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> on their behalf, and forgetful what a set of crabbed and imperfect creatures, whether as guests or otherwise, you do find them on trial! I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> you had enough of <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in that capacity, not very long ago!&#x02014; Well, I am flattered, and thankful; but must not dream of such an adventure in practice. The railway itself w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> lie like a Gorgon on the road; the <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> itself, were I there, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be enough to kill me. We have <hi rend="italic">here</hi> already a blazing &#x02003; a roasting daily, under wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I know not what to do with myself: indeed it has made me quite ill; and I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> long to be back into the sweeping storms of March ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, as far preferable.

We walked together and smoked a cigar. &#x02026; He does not talk to me of Mrs Paterson, as he did of Mrs Stirling&#x02014;perhaps because I did not know the former so intimately.&#x0201D; He enclosed a letter about John Rutter Chorley, who was very ill.</note>
 of whom he reports well:&#x02014;today I suppose him to be shooting thro&#x02019; the Mountains towards Dumfries and quiescence ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.</p>
<p>I myself have been nearly altogether <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> since he went; not even physically <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi> to almost any human creature.

 (age above 90, and always dear &#x02003; venerable to him); I fancied what the journey to Carlow<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow, Ireland, where Tyndall was born, and where presumably his mother had still lived.</note>

<p>Up to this time I have still made no &#x0201C;calls&#x0201D;; my humour in gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> is much too sombre, not to say ghastly and sepulchral often enough, to fav<hi rend="italic">r</hi> such an operat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I hope y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> cold is gone; that is a quite superfluous compan<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in one&#x02019;s rough journey,&#x02014;and is apt to be obstinate in the hot weather, they say. <hi rend="italic">Obstare principiis</hi> [face the enemy], is always good policy;&#x02014;and I trust you will report y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self entirely rid of <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, for one thing.</p>
<p>The other day I sent you a distracted little Book,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Possibly William Washington Evans, <hi rend="italic">A Pure Mind in a Pure Body, that is Health. A New System of Health and Medicine. The Antiseptic Treatment</hi> (<date when="1860">1860</date>), in which the author summarized the numerous medical benefits of charcoal.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I had gallopped thro&#x02019;, looking to right and left, not quite with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> some assent here and there, and entertain<hi rend="italic">t</hi> at the man&#x02019;s gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> folly: perhaps you did not look into it at all, and have sent it to the fire, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> indeed is its place. Nevertheless there was one thing it suggested to me, upon wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I will write you a word. My sleeping, my digestion &#x02003;c &#x02003;c have gone quite to <hi rend="italic">chaos</hi> since you left; I suppose it is the violently hot weather that may have hurt me: but cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> it is, nothing helps, <hi rend="italic">pills</hi> I seem to regard no more than if they were <hi rend="italic">peas</hi>; <hi rend="italic">castor</hi> itself, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I went upon yesterday, has only half done its funct<hi rend="italic">n</hi>: in short, the curse of <hi rend="italic">indigest</hi>n has fallen upon me more heavily than usual; and I am groping ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for some relief or remedy</p>
<p>&#x0201C;Charcoal&#x0201D; I had heard of before, as recommended &#x0201C;by Dr Russell&#x0201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Dr. James Russell at Thornhill, Dumfriesshire.</note> (ah me!), and I have been in the habit of <hi rend="italic">not</hi> reject<hi rend="italic">g</hi> a bit of <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> toast always, but oftener of <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> it,&#x02014;and the small result rather good. Now it struck me, in glancing at that mad Dr&#x02019;s &#x0201C;Anti-septic treatment&#x0201D; and perpetual talk ab<hi rend="italic">t charcoal</hi> &#x02003;c: &#x0201C;Well surely with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> &#x02018;Septic&#x02019; is entirely the rule; my whole <hi rend="italic">digest</hi>n is become a <hi rend="italic">Sepsis</hi>, disgusting and miserable; and I really think a mouthful of charcoal, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I get the right kind, and know the right method, might do me good!&#x0201D; This is the fact, and this is what I want you direct me in. I never in my life before had the least notion of a partic<hi rend="italic">r</hi> medicine; but I really have of this,&#x02014;and I must <hi rend="italic">try</hi> it, rather than welter along in this rotten quagmire with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> alleviat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>: so pray tell me what the right &#x0201C;course of charcoal&#x0201D; is for me; or if you don&#x02019;t at once know, ask Dr Russell for me,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1867-05-12">12 May</date>: &#x0201C;I do not know how the charcoal is used, &#x02003; cannot learn accurately from the little book you sent. But I will write to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell by this days post&#x02014;for tomorrow morning&#x02019;s early mail&#x02014;&#x02003; request him to give the necessary instructions without delay.&#x0201D; Dr. Russell wrote to TC, <date when="1867-05-13">13 May</date>: &#x0201C;I am sorry to understand that you are suffering as you have formerly suffered, from dyspepsia, and that you have a wish to try charcoal as a remedy.

It should be <hi rend="italic">recently prepared</hi> and kept from the atmosphere in a well stoppered phial. &#x02026; A drachm or teaspoonful (not larger at first) may be taken in water, say, twice a day, from one hour to three hours (as convenient) after breakfast &#x02003; after dinner.&#x0201D;</note>&#x02014;and I will proceed upon the <pb id="pg-44-196" n="44:196"/>thing a little; aided by hope at least!&#x02014; I did try one ride, not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> of benefit; but the mid-day season was so <hi rend="italic">hot</hi>, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not ride ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> changes in my <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi> hour &#x02003;c &#x02003;c, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are not yet settled: I mean to try that ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> too.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Dr. Russell continued: &#x0201C;Permit me to say farther, that where there is difficult digestion, it is most important that meals should be taken punctually at the same hour daily, and carefully masticated. &#x02026; Only a rigorous stomach can digest a meal rapidly thrown into it.&#x0201D;</note> But expedite the charcoal process, I pray you!&#x02014;&#x02014;</p>

<sourceNote>TC&#x02019;s first draft of the bequest of Craigenputtoch [FDBC], <date when="1867-05-12">12 May</date>. MS: EUL. Hitherto unpbd. The revenue from the bequest was to provide student bursaries. TC sent it to John A. Carlyle, who was negotiating for him with David Masson, prof. at Edinburgh Univ., and John Cook, W.S. [writer to the signet], in drawing up the deed. John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1867-05-19">19 May</date>: &#x0201C;I have read the enclosed &#x02003; I think it is every way simple &#x02003; suitable, &#x02003; I hope the completion of the matter under Masson&#x02019;s &#x02003; Cook&#x02019;s guidance will not cost you much more labour.&#x0201D; Masson then wrote to John A. Carlyle, <date when="1867-05-23">23 May</date>: &#x0201C;[Y]our note and the Paper have come. I will step round to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Cook&#x02019;s this afternoon. &#x02026; All seems ready now for the preparation of the Draft. I shall tell M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Cook to embody M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x02019;s Paper in it, continuously and <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi>; which he said might easily be done.

The addition of English, it seems to me, is of itself most important, &#x02003; would make the testing in Latin &#x02003; Greek clearer &#x02003; more effectual. And in Scotland it would do much to hinder any imitation of the Oxford &#x02003; Cambridge plan, by which students may be crammed with Latin &#x02003; Greek &#x02003; remain very imperfectly acquainted with their mother tongue.&#x0201D;</note> tho&#x02019; perhaps the future times gradually will wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> also <pb id="pg-44-199" n="44:199"/>gives good promise of a young mind;&#x02014;but as I do not feel certain that it gives perennially, or will perennially be tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in Universities to give, the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> promise, I am willing that the Senatus of the University, in case of a change of its opin<hi rend="italic">n</hi> on this point hereafter in the course of generat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, shall bestow these latter 5 Bursaries on what it does then consider the most excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> kind of Proficiency in matters <hi rend="italic">Classical</hi>, or the proof of a Classical mind, and directs its own highest effort towards teaching &#x02003; diffusing, in the new generat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> that will come.

<dateline>Chelsea, <date when="1867-05-18">18 May, 1867</date></dateline>
<salute>Dear James,</salute>
<p>I did not hear what y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Father did the other day at Craigenputtock (if indeed he went up at all, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I rather doubt);&#x02014;nor was there the least hurry in regard to hearing what he settled upon there, all likelihood being that I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and shall <hi rend="italic">assent</hi> upon every point. But there is another thing there, upon wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> (Whitsunday being so nigh)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Whitsunday, one of the Scottish quarter days, fell on <date when="1867-06-09">9 June</date> this year.</note>
 I will now apply to you, having no method otherwise,&#x02014;I mean Mr Common&#x02019;s behaviour in regard to dilapidat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, what damages are to be exacted from him; and my getting to the <hi rend="italic">bottom</hi> of that matter, and clearing my <hi rend="italic">conscience</hi> upon it, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have never yet quite done.</p>
<p>Four or five weeks ago, I wrote to Mr Adamson,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A. Carlyle wrote at length from Chelsea to James Carlyle Jr., <date when="1867-04-09">9 April</date>, mentioning TC&#x02019;s letter to Adamson of <date when="1867-04-08">8 April</date>: &#x0201C;Your uncle wrote to Adamson yesterday about the damage Common has done to the houses, &#x02003; fences especially of the plantations; &#x02003; is determined to try &#x02003; if possible make him pay for it all. This became necessary in my opinion too, after Common told the &#x02018;sixty men who gave him a dinner&#x02019; how ill-used he had been in not getting timely warning to quit the farm. / Now your uncle today bids me request you to <hi rend="italic">give the best estimate you can of the amount of damage Common could justly be charged with&#x02014;or in other words how much of the &#x000A3;400 for repairs one would have a right to demand for the injury he has done to houses &#x02003; fences. /</hi> &#x02026; I have found it <hi rend="italic">useless</hi> to tell your uncle how unlikely it is that he will be able to get any considerable compensation. He is determined to try it, &#x02003; I can only let him do so himself. &#x02026; The weakest part of the case seems to be that the woods were never looked after during the lease&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note>
 expressing with all emphasis what my feelings upon it were; and instructing him to take practically every strenuous and reasonable step towards getting such an intolerable injustice and absurdity <hi rend="italic">abated</hi>, and reduced to its strict <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi>. By negociat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, by arbitration,&#x02014;failing them, by deed of Court, or of <hi rend="italic">successive</hi> Courts;&#x02014;in <pb id="pg-44-201" n="44:201"/>fine, by any and every just and legal method; the thing, as I looked at it, being (not on the <hi rend="italic">money</hi> score, but on deeper and better grounds than money) an intolerable abominat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to me. Mr Adamson ans<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. He w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> write to me upon it in a day or two; but has never since written.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Adamson wrote, <date when="1867-04-09">9 April</date>: &#x0201C;I purpose writing you fully in reply to the position respecting the Farm and explaining matters in the course of a few days so soon as I have got the Leases &#x02003;c. examined.&#x0201D; James Claremont from the British Linen Company Bank, Dumfries, wrote to TC, <date when="1867-04-18">18 April</date>, that Adamson had been called &#x0201C;hurriedly to the country today but before leaving desired me to write you that the other business alluded to in your letter will be attended to as soon as possible.&#x0201D; John A. Carlyle wrote to James Carlyle Jr., <date when="1867-04-19">19 April</date>: &#x0201C;I hope A<supplied>[damson]</supplied> will just repeat what he said to me on the subject when I talked to him before leaving Dumfries&#x02014;in substance quite the same as what you say&#x02014;only one can hardly hardly expect him to state as plainly &#x02003; briefly as you do, that the affair is not one of <hi rend="italic">right</hi> but of <hi rend="italic">law</hi>.&#x0201D;</note>
 And there it rests ever since.</p>
<p>As I have found you a hardy, punctual and practical person, I now request you to take it in hand for me, and to do y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> best in it on my behoof with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> delay. You will have to go up to Dumfries directly, I suppose; and have an interview with Mr A., who will shew you my Letter to him, explanatory of all my knowledge or feeling on the subject: and then, upon consultat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> with him, and best reflexion with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self, ascertain what it is proper to do,&#x02014;or to do <hi rend="italic">farther</hi>, if anything has already been done. I want to write no more upon so vile and disagreeable a matter: but you will greatly oblige me if you do or can put this extremely ugly puddle into a clean state for me,&#x02014;or, if not into a <hi rend="italic">clean</hi>, then into the <hi rend="italic">very cleanest</hi> that is possible in the case.</p>
<p>If it do turn out that I am not only to suffer Common&#x02019;s having put his cattle into my woods with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> permission (nay <hi rend="small-caps">with</hi> <hi rend="italic">the contrary</hi>), but also to rebuild the fences he has torn down in so doing,&#x02014;there is one thing I will at least look to (and I must ask you as &#x0201C;Wood-forester&#x0201D; what the method of it is): To prevent an infatuat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the like kind ever occurring ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> under any Tenant!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1867-05-17">17 May</date>, after visiting Craigenputtoch: &#x0201C;We went &#x02003; saw the fences too in their worst parts. Those for plantations only in a ruinous state of disrepair, caused chiefly by long neglect, falling of trees on them, roots of trees raising them &#x02003;c. but in no case by apparent pulling down. Those for farm purposes all in tolerable repair &#x02003; what is called &#x02018;tenantable order.&#x02019; In my opinion &#x02003; in Jamie&#x02019;s &#x02003; James Aitken&#x02019;s, Common would not be liable for any damages on account of them in the usual mode of settling such matters.&#x0201D; James Carlyle Jr. then wrote to Samuel Adamson, <date when="1867-06-04">4 June</date>, enclosing a report from two local tenant farmers, John Fraser of Glaisters and David Stobo of Crogomains, who had looked into the state of Craigenputtoch at his request: &#x0201C;the Fences should be accepted as in <hi rend="italic">tenantable order</hi> because any repair the out-going tenant could be compelled to put upon them would be of very trifling advantage to the Proprietor. &#x02026; It is our opinion that the Mansion House and Offices may be considered as in &#x02018;tenantable order and condition&#x02019; at the end of the Lease; but the Cottage we consider far otherwise and to have been <hi rend="italic">greatly misused</hi>, and now quite unfit to be inhabited. Of the probable cost of restoring the Cottage to a habitable condition we cannot form an estimate&#x0201D; (MS: Ian Campbell).</note></p>
<p>In short I want you to help me out of this, dear James, with all the insight <pb id="pg-44-202" n="44:202"/>and prudent energy you have;&#x02014;and not to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> to me ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it any more than is indispensable.&#x02014;&#x02014; I hope John<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">James Jr.&#x02019;s brother, John Carlyle; John A.

He has been sorting all his papers &#x02003; putting his affairs in order. &#x02026; / Yesterday I had a letter from him, in which he requests me to write to you with his kind regards, &#x02003; ask your advice with regard to the money-investments he has in America. Lady Ashburton, he tells me, has large Estates left her by her late husband, from which she has for the last three years got no income at all, &#x02003; has had to send her case to your Chancery which seems to delay somewhat like our own in England&#x0201D; (MS: EUL).</note> Or perhaps this does not apply to inheritors of <hi rend="italic">Shares</hi>, but the mere <hi rend="italic">share-document</hi> (if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have such?) is valid for any Holder? I really wish you would write to Butler upon this <hi rend="italic">last</hi> question,&#x02014;which seems to me of <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> interest (if lying as Lady A. found it, or in the least involving difficulties to <hi rend="italic">Heirs</hi>)! Say I requested you, with my kind regards to him. &#x02026; My American things too are considerably unpleasant,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A. Carlyle noted: &#x0201C;In another part of the same letter, after speaking of some English R. W. Shares he holds which have fallen much in value, &#x02003; w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I had advised him to sell at once&#x0201D; and then quoted TC&#x02019;s words (MS: EUL).</note> but I keep hoping there will come a fitter or <hi rend="italic">cheaper</hi> time for bringing them over <hi rend="italic">hither</hi>,&#x02014;as I should truly like them to <hi rend="italic">be</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A. Carlyle added information about TC&#x02019;s book profits: &#x0201C;I may also mention that my brothers books continue to sell better &#x02003; better every year. For the year that ended last March he received nearly &#x000A3;<date when="1000">1000</date> from his publisher. And now I need not say more on the subject, as you have all the materials for forming an opinion.&#x0201D; He enclosed a photograph: &#x0201C;by far the best of Mrs Carlyle. My brother has had it enamelled at Paris, from the negative, most successfully&#x02014;by some newly invented process,&#x02014;&#x02003; has got it framed&#x0201D; (MS: EUL).</note> If you please, write to Butler &#x02003; <hi rend="italic">consult</hi> him?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">John Forster wrote from Plymouth, <date when="1867-05-26">26 May</date>: &#x0201C;Adieu, dear Carlyle, I am sick of the Reform Bill, and the Compound Household, and the right of women to vote, and the right of Irishmen or Yankees to commit treason without peril to their necks, and the right of Beales to this Park, and all other corresponding Rights of Man&#x02014;but I am always far more than I can say / Yours / John Forster / My companion through all my journey has been <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.&#x0201D;</note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I had better have written yesterday as I meant; but I had to go out riding; and there was, as there <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, literally nothing to say. The riding did me little good; blazing sunshine everywhere (the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> day of it for a fortnight,&#x02014;not 2 yards together of shade discernable anywhere in the Park;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Hyde Park.</note>&#x02014;so that I had to go into ambiguous streets and detours, to make my poor horse go at a walk instead of a good shaking gallop (that I might not kill him in the heat); and in made a profitless enterprise of it. If the day were ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> hot (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it now doubly is) I forbade him &#x0201C;for next day.&#x0201D; Last night was very bad with me (such the reward of &#x0201C;virtue&#x0201D;); and if it were not to prevent y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> entire disappoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, perhaps I had better <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have written,&#x02014;in this mood of body and mind. &#x0201C;Hot weather,&#x0201D; I suppose, must have something to do with it ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. I am ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> resolving on a radical change of hours (such as <hi rend="italic">once was</hi> the good rule here in summer); dine at 3&#x000BD;; go riding rather before 5,&#x02014;for if this poorest of all extant <hi rend="italic">stomachs</hi> don&#x02019;t <hi rend="italic">mend</hi>&#x02014; Well surely I ought to <hi rend="italic">try</hi> at least. But that cannot be till Tuesday next; owing to a pitiful engage<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I have: &#x0201C;Lady Stanley to escort to the Portrait Exhibit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x0201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">The second of three exhibitions of national portraits being held at the South Kensington Museum, <date when="1867-05-02">2 May</date> to <date when="1867-08-31">31 Aug. 1867</date>. The portraits in this exhibition covered the period from <date when="1688">1688</date> to <date when="1800">1800</date>; for the first exhibition, see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18660802-TC-JAF-01"><corr>TC to JAF, <date when="1866-08-02">2 Aug. 1866</date></corr></ref>.</note> (a paltry enough Exhibit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, I conjecture!)&#x02014;</p>
<p>There has not the least vestige of Letter worth <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> arrived here (and fewer <hi rend="italic">not worth</hi> than usual, thank Heaven): Forster&#x02019;s, I think, was here when I wrote last; but it contains some <hi rend="italic">Chapman</hi> shadow<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Forster wrote from Plymouth, <date when="1867-05-26">26 May</date>: &#x0201C;Just before I left (the day after seeing you) I had a word with Frederick Chapman about a projected &#x02018;Library&#x02019; Edition of the Works. I told him that if he named it to you, I had no doubt you would refer it to me&#x02014;and that I should think well of the proposal, if it would make it the opportunity of getting rid of the over-printed huge volumes of Frederick, and begin this experiment with a proper Library Edition of that book. I mention this now that you may think of it, &#x02003; talk it over with me on my return.&#x0201D;</note>
 (of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I know nothing), and I suppose he will be <hi rend="italic">here</hi> tomorrow to speak of it. Ruskin is in great agony ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that beggarly <hi rend="italic">Pall-Mall</hi> &#x0201C;Paragraph&#x0201D; Affair; but I have at least ended <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, and the dirty rumour of impertinent nothingnesses ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it;&#x02014;and he feels, or will feel, that the headlong folly he fell into <hi rend="italic">was</hi> &#x02018;absurd.&#x02019; <hi rend="italic">Finis</hi> to that dirty bubble!&#x02014;</p>
 <p>Masson is not come, and kindly keeps silence. My last Paper to you &#x02003; him was hardly gone when I betho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me that the notion of &#x0201C;Official persons&#x0201D; attending to such a matter was totally futile; but I hoped (&#x02003; believe) you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi>
 <pb id="pg-44-206" n="44:206"/>silently suppress that, <hi rend="italic">retaining</hi> the other kind of &#x0201C;Assessors&#x0201D; in small number. if all the Bursaries were to be given <hi rend="italic">at once</hi>, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be something for a Public like Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>: but I compute there can only (after a cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> length of time) be ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 2 of these each year! I am glad to have complete <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> on it, till the <hi rend="italic">Draught</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Deed</hi> appear.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Masson wrote to John A. Carlyle, <date when="1867-05-23">23 May</date>: &#x0201C;It may be yet a few days before I go to London&#x0201D;; he wrote two more very long letters to John A. Carlyle, <date when="1867-05-31">31 May</date> and <date when="1867-06-01">1 June</date>, detailing his views on the proposed management of the bursaries. John A. Carlyle forwarded them to TC, writing, <date when="1867-06-03">3 June</date>: &#x0201C;I got this [Masson&#x02019;s] second letter very early in the morning, &#x02003; have read it carefully more than once, &#x02003; spent the whole day in considering it, as I had done on Saturday &#x02003; yesterday with the first. And the two have convinced me: / 1. That the Examiners should be the Professors themselves of the Faculty of Arts, the Senatus naming one or two Professors from the other Faculties as Assessors to the Faculty of Arts. / 2. That the awarding of the Bursaries be left solely to the Senatus. &#x02026; / 3. That Latin, Greek, &#x02003; English be the subjects of examination for Five of the Bursaries. And I should think it best to leave the Senatus to determine the relative values of Latin, Greek, &#x02003; English. / 4. That the Senatus shall award the Bursaries on a written report from the Examiners.&#x0201D; TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1867-05-26">26 May</date>: &#x0201C;The &#x02018;John-Welsh Bursaries&#x02019; now actually in hand; the main <hi rend="italic">last thing then</hi> of setting one&#x02019;s house in order;&#x02014;do <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned).</note></p>
<p>I had a Note from J<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Aitken; but have not seen him this week; letter is inclosed.</p>

<salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>
<p>Last night I sent away to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> a paltry little Note (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, this morning, does not please me, and Be hanged to it!)&#x02014;after such concoction, rejecting, remodelling, nightly and daily botherat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and sheer waste of time and means as might have sufficed for a Book of the Iliad almost, instead of a Note to the Newspaper! For the beggarly Nothing is of a delicacy and difficulty almost infinite; like that of forging a horse-shoe in the middle of crazy powder-barrels,&#x02014;i.e. of the <hi rend="italic">hardly yet</hi> &#x0201C;sleeping&#x0201D; whirlwinds of impious Newsp<hi rend="italic">r</hi> rumour, capable of being re-awaked by a wrong word.&#x02014; This wretched Note you will probably see on monday morning; and from me, sure enough, it is intended to be <hi rend="italic">Finis</hi> on the matter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Ruskin referred to the dispute in prefatory remarks that he made to his lecture at the Royal Inst., <date when="1867-06-07">7 June</date>, &#x0201C;On the Present State of Modern Art.&#x0201D; Moncure Conway (<date when="1832">1832</date>&#x02013;<date when="1907">1907</date>; <ref target="volume-44/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/47686"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-43/ed-43-biographical-notes">
<sic>43:269</sic><corr>43:biographical notes</corr></ref>) later recalled: &#x0201C;Ruskin &#x02026; before beginning his lecture &#x02026; said words nearly like these: &#x02018;It may be expected that I would say something concerning the matter which has been publicly discussed relating to a statement of mine; but I will only say here that there are reasons, quite apart from the question of my accuracy, which prevent me from saying anything on the subject.&#x02019; / This was said so simply, so quietly, and Ruskin was so unconscious of their pathos, that there was a burst of applause&#x0201D; (Conway, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 2:106&#x02013;7).</note></p>
<p>Your pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> state of provocat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> does not surprise me at all, still less anger me at all. Excuse me if I say, there is even something of amiable in <hi rend="italic">it</hi> too (as there has uniformly been in all you have ever done, said or intended towards me); something generous and <hi rend="italic">filial</hi>; like the poignant sorrow of a very good, but far too headlong <hi rend="italic">son</hi>, getting his rebuke from <hi rend="italic">papa</hi>, with the consciousness as yet of only having meant the said papa too well and too kindly; a poignant sorrow wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> goes over into sparkles of wrath withal, for the time being. In ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 4 or 5 weeks of silence, I calculate that all this will have vanished and subsided; and the state of the case (one of the absurdest I was ever concerned in) will have become mathematically clear to you, on <hi rend="italic">both</hi> sides of it; as it has, for the last fortnight or so, completely been to me,&#x02014;mathematically clear, I assure you, after ample considering; and now <hi rend="italic">as</hi> inflexible and unalterable &#x0201C;as the 47<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of Euclid,&#x0201D; or as the <hi rend="italic">Fifth of Euclid</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Proposition 47 of Euclid&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> is the theorem of right-angled triangles; proposition 5 is the theorem of the isosceles triangle; i.e., with two equal sides.</note> if we like that instance better!&#x02014; ­Believe me, my friend, you will find that that Letter in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall</hi> was a necessity and duty on me. Better still, you will find that nothing <hi rend="italic">I</hi> c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> or can have <pb id="pg-44-209" n="44:209"/>written, or forborne to write,&#x02014;that not even the immortal gods, can <hi rend="italic">wash you clear of having done</hi>, thoughtlessly and with intentions purely noble and kind, <hi rend="italic">an immense imprudence</hi> of its sort (nothing <hi rend="italic">worse</hi>, but for cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> that); a deed <hi rend="italic">done</hi>,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> neither I nor the very gods can render <hi rend="italic">not</hi> done! Of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> there is no conceivable remedy, but what (I hope) you are now on the way towards, and will reach in ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 4 or 5 weeks hence, as above said.</p>
<p>If, by that time, you have arrived at complete contrit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, resolut<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of amend<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, and mathematical clearness on both sides,&#x02014;right happy shall I be to see y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> sunny face ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> unclouded as before: but if <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, I recommend that we both <hi rend="italic">wait</hi> to try if you can&#x02019;t and won&#x02019;t;&#x02014;and that in the meanwhile that accursed Paragr<hi rend="italic">h</hi> be <hi rend="small-caps">deleted</hi> from y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> reprint of the Dixon <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">For the report of the disputed paragraph, see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670522-TC-UC-01">
<corr>TC to UC, <date when="1867-05-22">22 May</date></corr></ref>.</note> At pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> this is all,&#x02014;except unabated regard for you, of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you you<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Word repeated at turn of page.</note> need no assurance. You see how mutinous my very hand and pen are!&#x02014; Y<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> ever (whether you achieve &#x0201C;contrition&#x0201D; enough or not),<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">Ruskin replied, <date when="1867-06-10">10 June</date>: &#x0201C;<supplied>[A]</supplied>las, you do not yet <hi rend="italic">in the least</hi> see into this thing. I never denied the imprudence&#x02014;discourtesy&#x02014;Sin&#x02014; &#x02026; of my Dixon letter. But I emphatically deny its falsehood. And that is &#x02026; the one question which has to be settled &#x02026; the worst harm of all would be its remaining <hi rend="italic">un</hi>settled.&#x0201D; He insisted that the Dixon letters would remain unaltered when published in book form, but the passage was not included in his published book of the letters, <hi rend="italic">Time and Tide</hi> (<date when="1867">1867</date>).</note></p>

<sourceNote>TC-JMC, <date when="1867-06-09">9 June</date>. MS: NLS Acc. 10367. Quot: &#x0201C;The Collection Online,&#x0201D; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Julia Margaret Cameron (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x02013;<date when="1879">79</date>; <ref target="volume-44/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4449"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), photographer, is identified as the recipient as she referred to TC&#x02019;s dislike of her photographs of him two days after he wrote the note (see below); TC&#x02019;s response was later summarized as &#x0201C;Terrifically ugly and woe-begone, but has something of likeness: my candid opinion&#x0201D; and printed in the commentary posted beside the photograph in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Cameron took her camera to London to photograph TC in Little Holland House, Kensington, where her sister Sara Prinsep, b. Pattle (<date when="1816">1816</date>&#x02013;<date when="1887">87</date>), and husband, Henry Thoby Prinsep (<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x02013;<date when="1878">1878</date>; <ref target="volume-44/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22811"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), m. <date when="1835">1835</date>, lived. Watts also lived there, and Cameron may have photographed TC in his studio. TC&#x02019;s sitting probably took place 7 or <date when="1867-06-08">8 June</date> as she registered the copyright of two negatives, <date when="1867-06-08">8 June</date>. One was full face and the other a right profile (see <!-- opp -->above). A slightly different full face was also taken; it was not registered and only ever printed as a carte-de-visite and given by Cameron to a friend (Julian Cox and Colin Ford, <hi rend="italic">Julia Margaret Cameron The Complete Photographs</hi> [<date when="2003">2003</date>] 312). The photograph of TC&#x02019;s left profile sometimes printed is a reverse of Cameron&#x02019;s original right profile. She met William Allingham on her way home to the Isle of Wight, <date when="1867-06-10">10 June</date>: &#x0201C;and Carlyle refuses to give me a sitting, he says it&#x02019;s a kind of <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi>!&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">William Allingham A Diary</hi>, eds.

<salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>
<p>With a Poet&#x02019;s temperament, you immensely exaggerate this miserable, but intrinsically small and paltry matter. &#x0201C;The most dishonouring words ever spoken of you&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Ruskin wrote to TC, <date when="1867-06-12">12 June</date>, accusing him of writing: &#x0201C;the most dishonouring words that could be set down in public sight.&#x0201D;</note> are, as you will understand by and by, simply to the effect, That you in headlong incautious way, with the best and truest intentions in the world, strode into one of the foolishest practical puddles recently heard of, and dragged a most unwitting friend along with you,&#x02014;who refuses to lie there with you (especially to lie <hi rend="italic">undermost</hi> as he chanced to be), and, finding you took no steps and did not even recognise the puddle much, has striven honestly to save first himself, and then his more or less blameable compan<hi rend="italic">n</hi> too,&#x02014;really with his best endeavour, and utmost stretch of faculty and skill, exerted in an element infinitely foreign and unpleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to him. So that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is now out, and getting his mind <hi rend="italic">cleaned</hi>; and you too are out (if you will be wise) with only an infinitesimal minimum of <hi rend="italic">smutch</hi> upon you,&#x02014;such as all sons of Adam catch to themselves from time to time, and are all absolved from, <hi rend="italic">so soon</hi> as they heartily acknowledge it. For the man that never made a &#x0201C;mistake&#x0201D; was not heard of hitherto.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">On his draft up to this point (MS: Ruskin Lib. Collection), TC wrote, perpendicular to the last line: &#x0201C;<hi rend="small-caps">ended</hi> now, and Be-hanged to it! (for the 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> and positively <hi rend="italic">last</hi> time!&#x02014; / (T.C.) <date when="1867-06-14">14 june</date>.&#x0201D;</note> And these are &#x0201C;the most dishonouring words that ever&#x0201D; &#x02003;c &#x02003;c. Oh dear, oh dear!&#x02014;</p>
<p>But on the whole, I too, my friend, have had my abund<hi rend="italic">t</hi> vexations, botherat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> and distresses ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> this small and miserable matter,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is so extraneous, so infinitely <hi rend="italic">incongruous</hi>, and comes intruding on me with such a ghastly contemptability, amid the serious, sad and solemn matters wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are <hi rend="italic">my</hi> constant occupat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> otherwise (especially sad in these weeks),&#x02014;that I too find it at last unbearable; and decide to have done with it at once, till it take a quite new figure! Please <hi rend="italic">don&#x02019;t</hi> send me any &#x0201C;formal Letter&#x0201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Ruskin wrote a brief letter, <date when="1867-06-10">10 June</date>: &#x0201C;this is private&#x02014;you will have my formal reply tomorrow&#x0201D;; he then wrote, <date when="1867-06-12">12 June</date>: &#x0201C;I cannot write the formal letter to day, any more than I could yesterday.&#x0201D;</note> but take this as my ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to <pb id="pg-44-213" n="44:213"/>it beforehand, and the only ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I will make to it or any other on that subject, as matters now stand bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> us:</p>
<p>First, therefore, I never told you, nor c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> tell any mortal, that &#x0201C;Mr Carlyle&#x0201D; was liable to be insulted on the streets of London or Chelsea; the constant <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> being that I have the natural liberty of all quiet persons to walk the streets unmolested, and if need were, protected &#x02003; defended; and that in no street, lane or place, of London or any other City, Town or Region, did &#x0201C;Mr Carlyle,&#x0201D; when personally recognised, meet with anything hitherto but an evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> respect far beyond what was his due, or what was in the least necessary to him. This is the stedfast fact; and this you have carelessly tumbled heels over head, into a statement incredible to all who hear it, and monstrous to imagine. Secondly, I did tell you that, by order of the Doctor I had <hi rend="italic">discontinued</hi> my midnight walks, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> used to have a sombre soothing charm, and to seem salutary, as the last work of the day.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A.

And what mad reversal you have made of this you cannot have forgotten! A domestic picture unexampled in Bris<hi rend="italic">h</hi> History or Biography. The wretched dreary old Dotard and Coward peering tremulously out of door at midnight, If he might now steal a little exercise,&#x02014;and not substance enough left in him even to kill himself if he c<hi rend="italic">d</hi>n&#x02019;t alter such a state of matters. <hi rend="italic">Papae, proh pudor</hi> [indeed, oh shame]! if a man were on the outlook for &#x0201C;dishonouring words,&#x0201D; or cared much ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> them when they came, here by accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> they <hi rend="italic">are</hi>, in richest measure for him.</p>
<p>In fine, so far as I can recollect those unlucky 10 minutes of loose talk, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> memory took so little charge of, and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are now several weeks away, our discourse did not turn upon public streets, thoroughfares or walking, but almost wholly on my experiences in riding, thro&#x02019; the unfrequented slums and waste-lying outskirts of London (tempted thither by the soft ground, or the immunity from wheels), where the lower populace or canaille inhabit: nor, ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, was my experience there in the least definable as &#x0201C;Mr Carlyle&#x02019;s,&#x0201D; but simply as that of A. or B., riding, seemingly for his amuse<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, and from his age or gravity of aspect, not very likely to use his horsewhip in reply (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> more than once proved a miscalculat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, too, and had firm effects on the individual two-legged canis, if he chanced to stand within reach). These are the precise &#x02003; certain facts (as precise as I can now give them) of that bit of private dialogue bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> us).</p>
<p>And now had you, instead of carelessly, hastily and heedlessly <hi rend="italic">reversing</hi> these, stated the whole of them with the accuracy of an affidavit, and then printed my name to them,&#x02014;what c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I have called it but the absurdest oversight, <pb id="pg-44-214" n="44:214"/>and foolishest &#x0201C;practical blunder&#x0201D; that ever dropped upon me of its own accord, from any man of sense, in all my days! And this is the last word I intend to write upon a subject, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has already cost me a great deal too many.</p>
<p>For I have had, not on my own acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> alone, to manipulate in my sad and sick Soul this paltry bit of nonsense not a little, to <hi rend="italic">tease</hi> it carefully down to its elemental fibres, and to sight and survey it on all sides, till I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> completely reckon it transparent to me and not it only but something of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> too, my friend, and of the mad worlds way with you and me; and in fine &#x0201C;to forge my miserable horse-shoe&#x0201D; (as I told you), &#x0201C;nay in success<hi rend="italic">n</hi> two horse shoes in the middle of leaky powder-barrels&#x0201D;:&#x02014;and I now thank God to have done with it altogether. Further words upon it especially bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> you and me, what good c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be in them, till a considerable change come; till, as I once said already, we <hi rend="italic">both</hi> of us come to see <hi rend="italic">both</hi> sides of the matter? Till each see, in a perfect and quietly transparent manner, not only his own grief, and whether he bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it wholly on himself, but also his neighbour&#x02019;s and whether <hi rend="italic">he</hi> did so! If I am so egregiously in <hi rend="italic">error</hi> to suppose that &#x0201C;six weeks&#x0201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">In his previous letter, <date when="1867-06-08">8 June</date>, TC hoped that Ruskin would come around in four or five weeks; Ruskin replied, <date when="1867-06-10">10 June</date>: &#x0201C;My <hi rend="italic">chief</hi> wonder is to see how little you have known me all these years!&#x02014;when you fancy that I should alter my mind in six weeks!&#x0201D;</note> will work this salutary change in you, I shall be profoundly sorry (and much surprised withal, for it is still my belief); but the actual coming of the change does not now depend on me at all; and till it do come, we must wait.</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>If I miss you today, let this Note convey to you my earnest request (if at all convenient to you) for <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> minutes of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> presence here, on Thursday next at 3 p.m. Ten minutes <hi rend="italic">here</hi> will suffice; but with cab to and from, it will take how much more you best know. The business is, To bear witness and write y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> name to a cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Deed of Bequest to Edin<hi rend="italic">r University</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">See TC&#x02019;s first draft of the bequest of Craigenputtoch, <date when="1867-05-12">12 May</date>. TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1867-06-12">12 June</date>: &#x0201C;Last night Prof<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Masson (who has been very helpful and along with my Brother, and by accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> John Forster, is alone particip<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of the secret) carefully <hi rend="italic">revised</hi> along with me here, my final correctn<hi rend="italic">s</hi> of the &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">Draft of Deed</hi>&#x02019; (Bursary matter, i.e.); and sends it back to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> today for revisal; after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>
<hi rend="small-caps">deed</hi> itself, &#x02003; signatures with witnesses, who I intend shall be Masson and Forster. All likely to be finished now in ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a week. Very solemn to me; very sad and high,&#x02014;re-awakens all the <hi rend="italic">religion</hi> I have. Alas, it is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> poor &#x02018;Abbey of Cor Dulce,&#x02019; for burying <hi rend="italic">my Loved One&#x02019;s Heart</hi>: and I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> see it done before I die!&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned).

Professor Masson (David Masson), who is here just now, has faithfully, wisely and altogether <hi rend="italic">silently</hi>, guided me, while still at home in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, thro&#x02019; all the Law intricacies, <hi rend="italic">Drafts, Second-Drafts</hi> &#x02003;c &#x02003;c: he is to be y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> fellow Witness to my Signing;&#x02014;and, so far as I know, you are the only Two, except my Brother<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A.

<p>If, as I know is possible, you cannot, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a good deal of official or other inconvenience,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Forster&#x02019;s work as a lunacy commissioner often took him out of London.</note> come,&#x02014;pray tell me; and I will at once absolve you. For <hi rend="italic">Froude</hi> is just come back, to whom I once hinted something of the thing as an <hi rend="italic">intent</hi>n ahead; and who is perfectly free and accessible at any hour.</p>
<p>In matter of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> &#x02003;c &#x02003;c I have had nothing but a series of confusions and petty disasters, since I saw you; but really don&#x02019;t feel <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> otherwise, almost better in some points; and am earnestly remodelling my dietetics, hours, and <pb id="pg-44-217" n="44:217"/>poor bits of procedures, in hope of getting back to <hi rend="italic">par</hi> at least, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you know is never a very high figure.</p>
<p>This thing once finished, on Thursday, I shall feel more independ<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of the Future and its paltrinesses. Thank God for leading us so far, not in <hi rend="italic">captivity</hi> to the paltry <hi rend="italic">Enemy</hi>; (<hi rend="italic">paltry</hi>, tho&#x02019; world-<hi rend="italic">huge</hi>), but in some degree of victory over him!

<p>Your note of yesterday is a most welcome favour to me; a very great and almost <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi> bit of charity and solace done me in the dark and sad element where you yourself are now living and waiting! The last time I saw your dear brother&#x02014;alas, I little thought it was the <hi rend="italic">last</hi>!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">John Rutter Chorley, longtime friend of TC, who was suffering from atrophy (i.e., a progressive decline); he d. <date when="1867-06-29">29 June</date>. TC last mentioned visiting him <date when="1866-08">Aug. 1866</date>; see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18660828-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1866-08-28">28 Aug. 1866</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x02014; I noticed no fatal symptom in him; nothing but very great misery and disquiet, which I lightly supposed the summer weather, and a shift to the shore of the sea, which was always such a favourite with him, would clear away; and I am never since free from an occasional doubt that I may have really pained him and done myself injustice by my light and hopeful way of treating all his misgivings and bad prognostics, which have proved so dismally true&#x02014;alas, alas!</p>
<p>From your brother William&#x02019;s letters to my brother John<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">William Brownsword Chorley (<date when="1804">1804</date>&#x02013;<date when="1879">79</date>; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18341211-TC-UC-01"><sic>9:400</sic><corr>TC to UC, <date when="1834-12-11">11 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>), M.D., and John A. Carlyle regularly corresponded; John wrote to TC, <date when="1867-06-02">2 June</date>: &#x0201C;I have not heard again from W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Chorley since last Sunday &#x02003; indeed I suppose he has nothing new to say. Of course John can see no one in his present state.&#x0201D; He then wrote, <date when="1867-06-05">5 June</date>, enclosing William Chorley&#x02019;s letter of <date when="1867-05-25">25 May</date>: &#x0201C;John does not seem to be suffering much pain. I dont altogether feel desperate yet in regard to his case, though there can certainly be very little hope. Of organic disease there never were any symptoms that I heard of.&#x0201D; But William Chorley had written: &#x0201C;I regret to say I can give no more favorable account of my brother&#x02019;s health than when I last wrote. He is now confined to bed; and [the doctor] has lost all hope of his ever recovering. This severe weather has borne heavily upon him: and the wasting and decline in strength increase from day to day.

Masson replied, <date when="1867-06-13">13 June</date>: &#x0201C;The translation you spoke of was wholly done by Carlyle, who also remembers that he gave in the book some simplification of the 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Book [of Euclid] which he thought at the time might be valuable. &#x02026; Brewster gave him &#x000A3;50 for the job&#x02014;not much for the work, but acceptable to him at the time&#x0201D; (MS: Univ. of London Lib.; pbd: Campbell 27:47.). Sir David Brewster (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x02013;<date when="1868">1868</date>; <ref target="volume-44/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3371"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); principal and vice-chancellor of Edinburgh Univ. <date when="1859">1859</date>&#x02013;<date when="1868">68</date>.</note>&#x02014;nothing more, except (as I suppose, but don&#x02019;t recollect) some supervision of the first few <hi rend="italic">Proofs</hi>, and then, finding it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go it itself, gladly let it go. The poor Book is still an innocently pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> reminiscence to me, as of a quiet little Island in the waster seas I was then sailing;&#x02014;tho&#x02019; I have never seen it since, and indeed do not remember ever to have seen it as a volume at all.</p>
<p>On the <hi rend="italic">Galbraith Legend</hi> I can throw no light, I did, sometimes, hear the name of Galbraith in those years, as of a dilig<hi rend="italic">t</hi> enough Mathematical &#x0201C;Private-Teacher&#x0201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">William Galbraith (<date when="1786">1786</date>&#x02013;<date when="1850">1850</date>), initially a parish schoolmaster in Eccles, Berwickshire, took a degree in mathematics at Edinburgh Univ. and became a respected mathematician and geographer.</note> but not as of a <hi rend="italic">writer</hi>, or in any other capacity; nor did I ever see <pb id="pg-44-219" n="44:219"/>him, or hear more of him in the long years that have followed.

I a little regretted this little circumstance; so, I think, did Masson secretly. He read us the Deed with sonorous emphasis, bringing every word and note of it home to us. Then I signed, then they two, Masson &#x02018;witnessing&#x02019; only with his eyes and mind.

</head><docBody>
<p>I, Thomas Carlyle, residing at Chelsea, presently Rector of the University of Edinburgh, from the love, favour, and affection which I bear to that University, and from my interest in the advancement of education in my native Scotland as elsewhere; for these, and for other more particular reasons, which also I wish to put on record, do intend, and am now in the act of making to the said University, bequest as underwritten, of the estate of Craigenputtock, which is now my property. &#x02026;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Ellipses are in the pbd. version.</note>
 Craigenputtock was for many generations the patrimony of a family named Welsh&#x02014;the eldest son generally a &#x0201C;John Welsh&#x0201D;&#x02014;in series going back, think some, to the famous John Welsh, son-in-law of the Reformer, Knox.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">For notes to TC&#x02019;s final bequest, see the notes to TC&#x02019;s first draft of the bequest of Craigenputtoch, <date when="1867-05-12">12 May</date>.</note>
 The last male heir of this family was John Welsh, Esquire, surgeon, Haddington (born at Craigenputtock in <date when="1775">1775</date>, died at Haddington in <date when="1819">1819</date>, a highly honoured, widely regretted man, and is buried in the Abbey <pb id="pg-44-221" n="44:221"/>Kirk of that town); his one child and heiress was my late dear, magnanimous, much-loving, and to me inestimable wife; in memory of whom, and of her constant nobleness and piety towards him and towards me, I now, she having been the last of her kindred, am about to bequeath to Edinburgh University, with whatever of piety is in me, this Craigenputtock which was theirs and hers, on the terms and for the purposes underwritten. Therefore, I do mortify and dispone, etc., for the foundation and endowment of ten equal bursaries, to be called the &#x0201C;John Welsh Bursaries,&#x0201D; in the said University, all and whole the twenty-shilling lands of Upper Craigenputtock, etc. &#x02026; More especially, I appoint that five of the John Welsh Bursaries shall be given for best proficiency in Mathematics (I would rather say &#x0201C;in Mathesis,&#x0201D; if that were a thing to be judged of from competition), but practically, above all, in pure geometry, such being perennially the symptom, not only of steady application, but of a clear, methodic intellect, and offering, in all epochs, good promise for all manner of arts and pursuits. The other five bursaries I appoint to depend (for the present and indefinitely onwards) on proficiency in classical learning&#x02014;that is to say, in knowledge of Latin, Greek, and English, all of these or any two of them. This also gives good promise of a mind; but as I do not feel certain that it gives perennially, or will perennially be thought in universities to give the best promise, I am willing that the Senatus of the University, in case of a change of its opinion on this point hereafter in the course of generations, shall bestow these latter five bursaries on what it does then consider the most excellent proficiency in matters classical, or the best proof of a classical mind, and directs its own highest efforts towards teaching and diffusing, in the new generations that will come. &#x02026; Bursaries to be always given, on solemnly strict and faithful trial, to the worthiest. &#x02026; Under penalties graver than I or any highest mortal can pretend to impose, but which I can never doubt&#x02014;as the law of eternal justice, inexorably valid, whether noticed or unnoticed, pervades all corners of space and of time&#x02014;are very sure to be punctually exacted if incurred, this is to be the perpetual rule for the Senatus in deciding. &#x02026; Bursaries to last till the usual term of admittance to trial for graduation as Master of Arts &#x02026; and so may a little trace of help to the young heroic soul struggling for what is highest, spring from this poor arrangement and bequest; may it run, for ever if it can, as a thread of pure water from the Scottish rocks, tinkling into its little basin by the thirsty wayside, for those whom it veritably belongs to. Amen. Such is my bequest to Edinburgh University. Dated <date when="1867-06-20">20th June 1867</date>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Grant noted: &#x0201C;Perhaps no document of the kind was ever composed in higher literary style, or was more imbued by the philosophy of the testator. From it we learn Carlyle&#x02019;s theory of education&#x02014;that mathematics must perpetually hold their place among the most important instruments of cultivation; but that Latin and Greek may very likely be superseded, in favour, perhaps, of the modern languages of Europe&#x0201D; (Grant 2:148).</note></p>
